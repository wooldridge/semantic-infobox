STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
BRAZIL&#13;
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
1. PROJECT ORIGIN AND DESIGN&#13;
1.1   Brazil's 1988 Constitutional reforms enhanced the importance of municipalities,&#13;
giving them both greater responsibilities and increased revenues to meet their new&#13;
responsibilities. These reforms leave municipalities better off now than they were in 1989,&#13;
largely as a result of Federal and state transfers but also from newly-created own sources.&#13;
Responsibilities that previously had been delegated to higher levels of government due to&#13;
lack of local resources and Brazil's centralist system -- in particular in the area of provision&#13;
of infrastructure and social services -- are now back in the hands of municipal mayors.&#13;
The challenge is for municipalities to provide these services efficiently, increasingly relying&#13;
on own rather than transferred resources, borrowing prudently, streamlining current&#13;
expenditures, investing in cost-effective projects, and contracting out and privatizing&#13;
services where appropriate.&#13;
1.2   The proposed project was initiated during elaboration of the urban policy of the&#13;
State of Bahia in the late 1980s. Bahia had been until then a predominantly rural state.&#13;
Urbanization rates that exceeded the regional and national averages by the end of the&#13;
1 980s, however (coinciding with the decentralization reforms), convinced State authorities&#13;
that well-managed, self-reliant local governments would be essential to the economic&#13;
growth of the State. Because of the commitment of high-ranking State officials, the&#13;
project concept gathered force with the explicit support of successive State Governors.&#13;
The project thus became a key element of development policy for the interior of the State.&#13;
Government leaders' commitment to the project, and the maturing process that it has&#13;
undergone, augur well for strong borrower ownership during implementation.&#13;
1.3   This is the seventh State-based municipal development project designed to support&#13;
Brazil's decentralization. The gradual transfer of lessons from projects under&#13;
implementation in the South of Brazil to the Northeast has been a long-term strategic&#13;
objective. It is the first such dedicated Bank-supported project in the Northeast --&#13;
following a similar component in a multi-sectoral project in Ceara (Loan 3789-BR) and a&#13;
pilot component in a municipal management project in Minas Gerais (Loan 3639-BR).&#13;
Lessons from these projects, as well as the recent OED report on urban lending,' have&#13;
been incorporated into project design. The major difference in the Bahia project is the&#13;
explicit introduction of a reform component to enable the municipalities to increase&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
revenues generated from own sources, and to encourage municipalities to privatize the&#13;
delivery of municipal services. Other key differences are simplification of sub-project&#13;
evaluation procedures; a standardized, strategic approach to institutional development;&#13;
and an explicit poverty-targeted component that builds on the lessons of urban upgrading&#13;
programs Bank-wide.&#13;
1.4   If municipalities are to be responsible for expenditures on many types of public&#13;
goods and services, then reform of the role, functions and financial management of local&#13;
governments must be designed as a coherent and cohesive package. A set of criteria to&#13;
assess design of municipal policy-making and reforms2 and their application to the case of&#13;
Bahia is shown in Annex IA. It is this analysis, along with lessons learned (Annex 1 B),&#13;
the urban poverty strategy in Brazil (Annex 1 C), and the State's own development&#13;
objectives that have principally guided both the Bank and State teams in project design.&#13;
1.5   The project was identified in April 1993. Three missions assisted the State of&#13;
Bahia in project preparation. The project was appraised in April 1995 and reappraised in&#13;
May 1996, following a review of the state's creditworthiness.&#13;

2. THE URBAN SECTOR&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
2.1    Brazil's 1988 Constitutional reforms enhanced the importance of municipalities in&#13;
the country's Federal system, so that they now have both greater responsibilities -- in&#13;
particular in the area of provision of infrastructure and social services -- and increased&#13;
revenues from own and transfer sources to fulfill their new responsibilities. This reform&#13;
comes at a time when Brazil's municipalities confront increasing challenges in the adequate&#13;
and efficient provision of services. Against the background of macroeconomic crises&#13;
(which began in the early 1980s) and high urbanization rates, municipalities face the&#13;
following set of circumstances: The first is low productivity of infrastructure assets.&#13;
Brazil's mature infrastructure networks are among the most extensive in the region. These&#13;
aging assets have not been adequately maintained, however, and are insufficient to meet&#13;
the growing demand for service. Second, with population pressure and economic&#13;
volatility, services increasingly have been provided in an informal and unregulated fashion,&#13;
which has led to degradation of the urban ecosystem, particularly infavela areas. Third,&#13;
over the past decade, poverty in Brazil has become increasingly an urban problem. Urban&#13;
poverty's share has increased to roughly half of the total poor. Fourth, with economic&#13;
crisis has come the failure of federal infrastructure delivery programs, creating an&#13;
institutional and resource gap. And fifth, despite decentralization, municipalities continue&#13;
to be dependent financially on Federal and State transfers, particularly in Brazil's North&#13;
and Northeast Regions. These factors point to a need to strengthen municipalities'&#13;
capabilities to efficiently manage both their resources and their responsibilities.&#13;
B. URBANIZATION: STRUCTURE AND TRENDS&#13;
2.2    Brazil's federal structure of government encompasses 26 states and about 5,000&#13;
municipalities.3 With about 75% of its 153.2 million inhabitants living in urban areas in&#13;
1990, Brazil is one of the most populous urban societies in the world.4 In addition to the&#13;
megacities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro -- with metropolitan region populations of&#13;
about 16 million and I 1 million, respectively -- Brazil has another nine cities with more&#13;
than one million inhabitants, including Salvador, the capital of Bahia (metropolitan region&#13;
population of about 2.5 million), and numerous medium-sized cities (with populations of&#13;
100,000 to one million). The largest urban concentration is found in the more developed&#13;
Southeast region of the country, while the North and Northeast Regions until the last&#13;
decade have been predominantly rural.&#13;
2.3   In the past, rapid urban population growth required a major effort by public sector&#13;
authorities to keep pace with the increasing demand for urban infrastructure. During the&#13;
3   The decision to create new municipalities belongs to the states. During 1992 approximately 300 new&#13;
municipalities were formed.&#13;
4   "Urban" is defined as urban concentrations with populations greater than 20,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
1970s, Brazil's urban population grew by 4.4% per year. Migrants leaving depressed rural&#13;
areas, the populations of which fell by 60% during the decade, helped fuel this urban&#13;
demographic growth. Nationwide urbanization rates slowed in the 1 980s to an average of&#13;
3.4%. The census also indicates a significant slowdown in Brazil's demographic growth to&#13;
1.9% per year over the 1980-91 period (against 2.5% per year during 1970-80). This&#13;
reduced pace of population growth may give municipalities some breathing space to make&#13;
much-needed improvements in the quality of urban services provided.&#13;
C. THE CENTRALIZED MODEL OF URBAN SERVICE DELIVERY&#13;
2.4   Until recently, Brazil's urban policy and infrastructure service delivery mechanisms&#13;
were strongly centrist through a large network of federal and state institutions. National&#13;
urban policy was formulated by the National Commission on Metropolitan Regions and&#13;
Urban Policy (CNPU) during the 1 970s, by an inter ministerial National Urban&#13;
Development Council (CNDU) in the mid-i 980s, and finally by a short-lived Ministry of&#13;
Urban Development (MDU) from 1985 to 1988. Throughout the entire period urban&#13;
infrastructure financing was dominated by the National Housing Bank (Banco Nacional de&#13;
Habitacdo - BNH). BNH channeled the proceeds of workers' compulsory savings&#13;
(FGTS) into housing and sanitation infrastructure. Among the most important BNH-&#13;
financed programs were the National Sanitation Plan (Plano Nacional de Saneamento -&#13;
PLANASA) for water and sewerage works, executed through state water and sewerage&#13;
companies; and the National Low-Cost Housing Plan (Plano Nacional de Habita(ao&#13;
Popular - PLANHAP), also executed through state agencies. Urban transport was&#13;
centralized as well, under the Brazilian Urban Transport Company (Empresa Brasileira de&#13;
Transportes Urbanos - EBTU).&#13;
2.5   These efforts deliberately excluded municipalities in the name of centrist national&#13;
coordination objectives and economy-of-scale gains. Since 1982, federal government&#13;
fiscal deficits have precipitated a steady retreat from the use of these central financing&#13;
institutions and their policy-making counterparts. The principal financial intermediary of&#13;
the Government of Brazil (GOB), and one of the country's largest banks, the Caixa&#13;
Economica Federal (CEF), has inherited the remainder of these earlier programs without&#13;
the resources to sustain them. In retrospect, the effective collapse of these centralized&#13;
financing schemes in the early 1990s could have been foreseen as inevitable since they&#13;
relied on unsustainable subsidies in the absence of meaningful cost recovery.&#13;
D. DECENTRALIZATION AND CURRENT URBAN POLICY&#13;
2.6   In the wake of the restoration of democracy in the 1980s, and free elections at all&#13;
levels of government, the 1988 Constitution represented a watershed. Key provisions of&#13;
the Constitution consolidated the process of decentralizing authority away from the&#13;
federal government. Article 30, for example, spells out the responsibilities of&#13;
municipalities with respect to tax collection and the provision of local services; Articles&#13;
156 and 158 provide for enhanced fiscal revenues for municipalities to meet these&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
2.7   Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations. The Constitution increased both municipal&#13;
shared and own-source revenues, at the expense of federal revenues (Annexes 2A and&#13;
2B). Between 1988 and end-1993, the municipal share of federal income tax (IR)&#13;
increased from 17% to 22.5%; federal industrial product tax (IPI) increased from 16% to&#13;
22.5%; and value-added tax collected by states (ICMS) grew from 20% to 25%. The&#13;
Constitution also established a new municipal tax on fuel sales (IVVC) and gave exclusive&#13;
collection rights to municipalities for the property transfer tax (ITBI), which was formerly&#13;
shared with the states. Additional fiscal revenue has accrued to municipalities mostly&#13;
through increased revenue sharing, primarily the ICMS. New municipal taxes have not&#13;
replaced the property tax (IPTU) and service tax (ISS) as municipalities' principal source&#13;
of self-generated revenue. Studies indicate that by end- 1993, these reforms had increased&#13;
municipal revenues by approximately one-third. The municipal share of all taxes collected&#13;
in Brazil in 1993 reached nearly one quarter, against a pre-reform level of 18%. Revenue&#13;
sources for a sample group of Brazilian state capitals are shown in Table 1.&#13;
Table 1: Municipal Revenue Sources; Average for Selected Brazilian State Capitals&#13;

a/ Source: Brazil: The Challenge of Municipal Sector Development in the 1990s, IBRD&#13;
Report 10161-BR, February 1992.&#13;
bl It should be noted that State capitals' own resources as a percent of the total is&#13;
significantly higher than for the total of all municipalities.&#13;
2.8    Both the states and the federal government are affected. States have gained&#13;
slightly. While their shares of IR rose from 16% in 1988 to nearly 25% in 1993, and IPI&#13;
from 16% to just over one-third, they have lost an extra 5% of ICMS to municipalities.&#13;
The federal government has seen its 67% share of IR and IPI drop to some 50%.&#13;
2.9   Political Change. In addition to its administrative and financial aspects,&#13;
decentralization is an important dimension of Brazil's governance framework. It&#13;
strengthens the country's return to democracy, begun in 1982, when the first free elections&#13;
for state governors were held as part of the then-military government's move towards&#13;
political opening, or abertura. In 1984, municipal mayors were elected in some&#13;
jurisdictions for the first time. Democratic consolidation continued with elections in 1986&#13;
for part of Congress and for state governors for the second time. The promulgation of the&#13;
new Constitution and elections for city mayors for the second time occurred in 1988. In&#13;
1989, there was direct vote by universal suffrage for President and in 1992 elections for&#13;
municipal mayors were again held. The second set of municipal elections are set to take&#13;
place in October 1996. Expanded responsibilities for these elected officials are expected&#13;
to lead to increased local accountability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
2.10   Current Urban Policy. With the Cardoso Administration in 1995 a new&#13;
Secretariat of Urban Policy (SPU) was established in the Ministry of Planning. The SPU&#13;
replaced the former Secretariat of Urban Development, and is intended as a policy-&#13;
formulating agency, rather than an executive agency. This secretariat will not have&#13;
responsibility for allocation of funds. It will instead be responsible for establishing broad&#13;
urban development policies. In this work it will coordinate closely with IPEA, the federal&#13;
government's institute for economic and applied research, and with the government's&#13;
newly-established Community Solidarity Program (Programa de Comunidade Soliddria-&#13;
PCS). The PCS plans to address poverty through decentralized implementation and direct&#13;
involvement of beneficiary communities in five areas: (a) nutrition and health; (b)&#13;
employment generation; (c) social safety nets for vulnerable populations (children and&#13;
elderly); (d) rural poverty; and (e) urban poverty. The urban poverty focus will&#13;
concentrate on the peripheries of medium-size and large cities. The SPU will work closely&#13;
with the PCS in coordinating poverty-alleviation efforts in urban areas. The federal&#13;
government has requested Bank assistance in developing an integrated urban policy,&#13;
including an urban poverty strategy. A program of technical assistance, training, and&#13;
seminars is under preparation.&#13;
E. THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT&#13;
2.11  Brazil sustained buoyant economic growth of 8.6% per annum during the 1970s&#13;
through industrial expansion was based initially on inexpensive energy supplies and&#13;
subsequently on inexpensive external credit following the oil price shocks of 1973 and&#13;
1978. Brazil's total external debt rose from US$12.0 billion in 1973 to US$91.3 billion in&#13;
1982, and the country followed Mexico into default on debt repayments that year.5&#13;
Rampant and unstable inflation has hampered Brazil's economic recovery since 1982. It&#13;
has also played havoc with public finances, frustrating attempts of the public sector at all&#13;
three levels to generate savings. Economic growth driven by federal government funding&#13;
faltered as additional external resources dried up and interest rates on outstanding loans&#13;
soared. Thus, even without the concurrent political pressures in favor of decentralization,&#13;
economic crisis has made decentralization an appealing financial alternative. In July 1994,&#13;
the Franco Administration launched a new stabilization plan, the Plano Real, named after&#13;
the new currency created as one of the key fiscal reform measures. In tandem, the&#13;
Government introduced significant structural reforms (beginning in 1990), including trade&#13;
liberalization, deregulation, and privatization of state enterprises. These measures are&#13;
being continued under the Cardoso Administration.&#13;
2.12  The Share of Brazil's Local Governments in the Economy. As demonstrated in&#13;
Table 2, municipalities have become significant players in Brazilian public finance. In&#13;
1990, total municipal resources amounted to 5.2% of GDP (nearly twice the 1985 level),&#13;
total expenditures 4.3% (1.8% of which represented the wage bill), and capital&#13;
investments 1% of GDP, or nearly twice the federal government's investment expenditures&#13;
fiscal base (Annex 2B). With urban growth has also come an important potential, (as yet&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
unexploited). Total municipal revenues now are derived about 20% from own sources,&#13;
such as property taxes. Better local service provision will increase residents' willingness to&#13;
pay both local taxes and user charges.&#13;

|BRD Report 10161-BR.&#13;
2.13  Municipalities have in the recent past confronted three important linkages with the&#13;
macroeconomy. First are the negative effects of endemic inflation: (i) parameters of&#13;
property and other taxes, which are important sources of own revenues, are difficult to&#13;
adjust for inflation; (ii) financial administration, notoriously weak in smaller municipalities,&#13;
must be agile and efficient to manage inflation; and (iii) high inflation makes adequate&#13;
planning and budgeting virtually impossible. Second is the potential for a municipal debt&#13;
crisis if borrowing is not done on a prudent scale. Off-budget items such as suppliers'&#13;
credits and rollover of existing debt are common, primarily in the larger municipalities,&#13;
which have a history of borrowing (the smaller ones do not). Caution will need to be&#13;
exercised in ensuring that discretionary transfers are not relied on to service imprudent&#13;
borrowing, and that rollovers, transfers and suppliers' credits are adequately accounted for&#13;
in calculation of credit limits. And third is the paucity of adequate, consistent financial&#13;
reporting and financial data across municipalities with which to monitor progress on&#13;
implementation of policy and impact on the macroeconomy of the country.&#13;
F. SECTOR STRATEGY: A MEDIUM-TERM VISION FOR THE ROLE OF MUNICIPALrrIES&#13;
2.14  With decentralization, municipalities act as quasi-autonomous managers of&#13;
expenditures for services such as health, education, water supply, waste collection,&#13;
drainage, paving and public transport. Municipalities, in theory, have a comparative&#13;
advantage in the provision of these services because local governments, particularly after a&#13;
return to democratically-elected leaders, are more knowledgeable about local needs and&#13;
better at responding rapidly to changes in these needs. This does not mean that&#13;
municipalities should provide all services by themselves. For many of these activities,&#13;
municipalities should rely on the private sector through concessions, contracting or&#13;
investment participation, expanding the scope of service delivery. Since many of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
services are intermediate goods in the production of private services, municipal&#13;
perfornance in managing these expenditures will also contribute to Brazil's&#13;
macroeconomic performance. Municipalities should also contribute to a return to&#13;
sustainable macroeconomic growth through their own fiscal efforts, and ensure their&#13;
financial independence and health by maximizing the revenues they can raise from their&#13;
own sources. The local tax burden -- including local tax levels, but also local user fees&#13;
and the pricing of local services -- should increasingly be determined by the level of&#13;
demand for services.&#13;
2.15  In sum, over the medium-term municipalities will need to place greater emphasis&#13;
on efficiency and financial management. The challenge for municipalities today is to&#13;
establish their own mechanisms of infrastructure delivery based on increased fiscal&#13;
autonomy. To this end, improved municipal administration can help to fill the vacuum left&#13;
by the demise of national programs. The key goals for municipalities will be to:&#13;
(a)    mobilize their own resources more effectively, by widening their tax bases&#13;
and exploring alternative sources of revenue, such as user charges and&#13;
betterment taxes;&#13;
(b)    allocate these resources more efficiently through rigorous appraisal of new&#13;
investments;&#13;
(c)   increase efficiency in the use of resources for current expenditure through&#13;
the improvement of day-to-day administration;&#13;
(d)    engage the private sector, through privatization and contracting out, for&#13;
those municipal investments and services it can provide more efficiently;&#13;
(e)    prudently borrow market resources to fund priority operations with high&#13;
economic and financial rates of return; and&#13;
(f)    begin to plan and budget more effectively while explicitly monitoring&#13;
financial performance.&#13;
2.16  Rationale for Bank Involvement. According to the current Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on June 6, 1995, and&#13;
updated in June 1996, support for structural reforms at the federal and state levels is a&#13;
major element in the Bank's assistance strategy for Brazil. Moreover, the Bank seeks to&#13;
shift its assistance strategy increasingly toward states. This re-orientation of emphasis on&#13;
lending to the states is principally due to the increased importance of the states in the&#13;
provision of key services and infrastructure, and the finding that projects are successful&#13;
primarily in states with viable fiscal positions (and hence investment programs); only in&#13;
such cases is the needed volume of counterpart funding available. Therefore, the Bank&#13;
will focus its lending on: (i) developing policy dialogues differentiated by states or groups&#13;
of states; (ii) formulating investment operations that serve as vehicles to improve the&#13;
policy and institutional framework; and (iii) supporting some states' efforts to improve&#13;
their finances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
2.17   The Bank proposes a three-pronged strategy toward state lending: (i) investment&#13;
loans, principally in the social sectors and in infrastructure in creditworthy states; (ii)&#13;
reform loans where strong fiscal and sector policy reforms are being implemented; and (iii)&#13;
for states with poor creditworthiness, the Bank would lend via federal loans (requiring&#13;
federally funded counterpart financing), if suggested by the Federal Government. The&#13;
Bank would not lend directly to uncreditworthy states. In summary, to improve overall&#13;
state creditworthiness, future sector lending operations will take place on a state-by-state&#13;
basis, and will primarily be targeted toward those reform-prone states, while other&#13;
operations will be targeted toward less reform-prone states in order to enable them to&#13;
become eligible for future Bank support.&#13;
2.18  In this case, Bahia is a creditworthy state (see Annex 3G). The proposed project&#13;
will seek to reduce municipal dependence on state transfers by helping the municipalities&#13;
to increase their own resources and to use them wisely, as well as developing a municipal&#13;
development fund.&#13;
2.19   Urban Sector Strategy. The Bank's strategy in the urban sector in Brazil, as set out&#13;
in the report, Brazil: The Challenge of Municipal Sector Development in the 1990s,&#13;
February 1992 (IBRD No. 10616-BR), is to support the decentralization reforms which&#13;
took effect with the 1988 Constitution, and foster among Brazil's municipalities&#13;
strengthened financial management and increased fiscal responsibility. This would be&#13;
achieved through support to financially-sound and reform-oriented states, and through&#13;
continuing policy dialogue and technical assistance at the federal level. The proposed&#13;
project is part of a strategy that has sought to gradually transfer the lessons of urban&#13;
experience in the South of Brazil to the Northeast, where ongoing and planned operations&#13;
would reach those states with the largest urban populations.&#13;
2.20   Urban Poverty Strategy. The urban share of total poor in Brazil has increased&#13;
significantly, from about 40% in 1980 to about half of the total in 1993. The report&#13;
Brazil: A Poverty Assessment (March 1995) sets out a profile of urban poverty. It&#13;
indicates, for example, that a key differentiating feature of the poor and the non-poor is&#13;
access to basic urban infrastructure. Urban sector strategy has also emphasized the&#13;
importance of targeting of benefits to the very poor. The project is part of a poverty-&#13;
alleviation strategy for Brazil that involves economic and sector work, country dialogue&#13;
and lending in the areas of rural development, health and education as well as urban&#13;
development (Annex 1C).&#13;
2.21   The primary emphasis is on efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in the&#13;
public sector, improved environmental management and the appropriate targeting and&#13;
delivery of services to the poor. The proposed project is fully consistent both with the&#13;
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and with the Brazilian Government's evolving&#13;
urban policy and poverty strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
G. BANK EXPERIENCE IN THE URBAN SECTOR&#13;
2.22  Lessons Learned. Since 1978 the Bank has made 18 loans for urban development&#13;
and transport projects in Brazil, totaling about US$1.78 billion. In addition, 19 loans&#13;
totaling about US$2.18 billion have been made for water and sewerage projects since&#13;
1971, also largely in urban areas. The proposed project would build on lessons learned&#13;
over several decades in the urban sector. The recent OED review of urban sector lending'&#13;
cites several features of best practice, among them demonstrated borrower ownership,&#13;
emphasis on institution-building, secure land tenure for beneficiaries, well-designed&#13;
environmental components, and explicit poverty reduction aims. Constraints to successful&#13;
implementation are excessive focus on physical outcomes (at the expense of institutional&#13;
outcomes), poor design of environmental components, mechanisms that favor high-&#13;
standard infrastructure, and inadequate assessment of effective demand. The OED review&#13;
argues for a more comprehensive approach to the design of urban projects that secures&#13;
project ownership, relies on institutional development and policy reform, taps potential&#13;
macroeconomic linkages, strengthens the congruence of objectives and design, and&#13;
provides for well-defined monitoring and evaluation. Consistent with these&#13;
recommendations and Brazil's decentralization reforms, the Bank's project objectives have&#13;
shifted towards improving the capacity of states and municipalities to effectively assume&#13;
increased responsibilities for efficient management of resources and services under a series&#13;
of projects which began in the southern states of Santa Catarina (Loan 2623-BR --&#13;
PROURB - closed in 1993); Parana (Loan 3100-BR - PEDU); Rio Grande do Sul (Loan&#13;
3129-BR - P1MES); Minas Gerais (Loan 3639-BR - SOMMA); and CearA (Loan 3789-&#13;
BR - PROURB). Lessons from preparation, implementation, mid-term reviews, and&#13;
completion of these projects, among others, have been incorporated into project design.&#13;
Annex lB presents significant lessons learned and how they are incorporated into the&#13;
design of the proposed project.&#13;

3. THE STATE OF BAHIA&#13;
3.1   The State of Bahia covers an area of about 560,000 square kilometers, or about&#13;
the same size as France, making it the fifth largest of Brazil's states and the largest of the&#13;
Northeastern states. With I 1.9 million inhabitants (8% of the country's total), Bahia is&#13;
more populous that Portugal, and is fourth nationwide in terms of population and first in&#13;
the Northeast region. Bahia is composed of three regions: the coastal mata atlantica, or&#13;
native Atlantic forest; the cerrado or plains; and the sertdo or semi-arid "outback". The&#13;
mata atlatitica is by far the most populous of these areas, in which are located the State's&#13;
major urban centers, including Salvador -- the State's capital -- and the nine other cities&#13;
which form the Salvador Metropolitan Region (RMS). Bahia is divided administratively&#13;
into 15 "economic regions," on the basis of geographical and economic similarities.&#13;
A. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY&#13;
3.2   The State's economic activity has driven its patterns of urban growth.&#13;
Traditionally an agricultural region (with 74% of its residents in rural areas in 1950), the&#13;
State relied on primary export commodities such as cocoa and other agricultural products&#13;
until the 1 970s when the cocoa market collapsed and the State began to diversify into&#13;
other areas. Major efforts to industrialize the economy stem from this era, with the&#13;
construction of refining/petrochemical, pulp and paper and mining and metallurgical&#13;
activities. While economic activity in 1960 was primarily agricultural, by 1993 just 14.5%&#13;
of the State's GDP of about US$20 billion was produced in the primary agricultural&#13;
sectors, with 34.6% in the secondary industrial sectors and 50. 1% of GDP produced in the&#13;
service-related sectors (Annex 3A). Industrialization has brought wealth to the State, with&#13;
GDP of the State the sixth in Brazil, amounting to 5% of the country's total GDP. This&#13;
transformation of the State's economy has brought a dramatic shift in patterns of urban&#13;
growth, with a large part of the population and a large share of GDP generated in urban&#13;
areas, particularly in the RMS.&#13;
B. URBANIZATION&#13;
3.3    As recently as 1980, Bahia was still essentially rural, with less than half its&#13;
population (49%) living in urban areas. This reflects the traditional rural character of the&#13;
Northeast, and the fact that it industrialized more recently than Brazil, thus giving it&#13;
slower urbanization rates than the average for Brazil. By 1991, however, roughly 60% of&#13;
Bahia's population, or about 7 million people, lived in urban areas (Annex 3B). While this&#13;
leaves Bahia significantly less urbanized than Brazil as a whole (where the average of&#13;
urban population as a percent of total is 75%), this level matches the average urbanization&#13;
of the Northeast Region. Although several Northeastern states have higher rates of&#13;
urbanization, Bahia has by far the greatest absolute number of urban dwellers, with nearly&#13;
one-third (27%) of the Northeast's total urban residents, and 28% more than the next-&#13;
ranked urban state (Pernambuco). In fact, the states of Pernambuco, Ceara and Bahia&#13;
together are home to two-thirds of the urban residents of the Northeast. Bahia has 415&#13;
municipalities, 225 of which have total populations over 15,000 (Annex 3C). Projections&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
indicate that by the year 2000, Bahia will have 14.7 million people, or 67% of the total,&#13;
living in urban areas.&#13;
3.4    Bahia has fewer smallholdings of less than two hectares than the rest of the&#13;
Northeast, with roughly 85% of all smallholders being owners (compared with 56% in the&#13;
Northeast). Further, drought is not nearly as pervasive as in Ceara, and in the west of&#13;
Pernambuco and Piaui. These factors make conditions of rural subsistence farming less&#13;
difficult in Bahia than in many other areas of the Northeast, and help explain the still&#13;
relatively large rural population, despite significant industrialization.&#13;
C. SOCIAL INDICATORS&#13;
3.5    While it is one of the country's richest states, Bahia's large population gives it a&#13;
comparatively low per capita income of US$1,660, or about 60% of the country's average.&#13;
Further, wealth is unevenly distributed, with about one-third of the population living&#13;
below the poverty line (Annex 3D).7 The State has the second-lowest level of literacy in&#13;
the Northeast (a region which ranks among the worst in Brazil), after Alagoas. Other&#13;
social indicators confirm the notable contrast between Bahia's comparatively well-off&#13;
status within the Northeast Region and the poor quality of life it affords most of its&#13;
residents. Sanitation services are among the Region's worst: 43.7% of Bahia's residents&#13;
(73.9% in urban areas) have access to piped water supply (only the State of CearA has&#13;
lower coverage); 5% of residents (8.4% in urban areas) have collected waste water (only&#13;
the State of Piaui, the poorest state in the country, has lower coverage). There is no&#13;
meaningful sewage treatment (Annex 3E). As could be expected from such indicators,&#13;
60% of children's hospital visits are caused by poor sanitation, with 30% of the deaths of&#13;
children under the age of one year old due to water-borne diseases. There are wide&#13;
regional differences among the State's fifteen economic regions (Annex 3F).&#13;
D. THE STATE'S DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES&#13;
3.6   Since the early 1990s the State recognized this contrast between its economic&#13;
wealth and the condition of misery of most of its residents. The State's objective,&#13;
continued under the current administration which took office in early 1995, is to&#13;
modernize and expand its industrial base, with the objective of bringing the State to third&#13;
or fourth place in terms of economic strength, while at the same time improving the&#13;
quality of life for its residents. In order to meet this objective, the State has established a&#13;
clear developmental strategy, at the center of which is the need to strengthen the&#13;
administration of urban areas, particularly in the State's interior. The objective is to&#13;
gradually shift from providing intermediate goods to the provision of finished products,&#13;
both for export to other states and countries, and to meet the needs of the State's&#13;
increasingly large urban-based markets. Economic growth will bring increased&#13;
7  The poverty line is here defined on the basis of the report Brazil: A Poverty Assessment (March&#13;
1995) as a per capita income of about one-third the minimum wage (of September 1990, or about&#13;
US$60) in rural and urban areas of the Northeast, and about half the minimum wage in the case of&#13;
Salvador.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
employment opportunities, and will be balanced by a program of investments in the social&#13;
sectors, particularly education and health, to prepare a well-qualified work force. In order&#13;
to attract investment, however, the State will need to diversify away from its current&#13;
geographic industrial center which is the Salvador Metropolitan Region (Regiao&#13;
Metropolitana de Salvador-RMS). This implies strengthening of the cities in the interior,&#13;
so that they are well-administered and self-sufficient, and attract investment and provide&#13;
urban services for their local communities. The proposed project is a direct result of the&#13;
State's multi-year development plan and its development strategy beginning more than&#13;
two years ago in the previous administration.&#13;
3.7   Investment priorities for State development have focused on ongoing projects to&#13;
support the health and education sectors, the reformulated rural poverty projects, and&#13;
support to the RMS. Planned investments which are of the highest priority in the State&#13;
administration are cleanup of the Bahia dos Todos os Santos in the Salvador Metropolitan&#13;
area, financed by an IDB loan, a follow-up rural poverty alleviation project supported by a&#13;
World Bank loan (3917-BR), and the proposed municipal infrastructure development and&#13;
management project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE&#13;
4.1    Objectives. The primary objectives of the proposed Bahia Municipal Management&#13;
Project (PRODUR) are to:&#13;
(a)   improve the living conditions of the urban poor, through: (i) development&#13;
of detailed, reliable systems for mapping of urban poverty in the state to&#13;
guide state and local investment strategies; and (ii) a poverty-targeted&#13;
program of urban upgrading in critically poor urban areas, or bolsoes de&#13;
pobreza (pockets of poverty).&#13;
(b)   increase municipal public sector efficiency and sustainability of financing&#13;
for key municipal services;&#13;
(c)   support privatization and concessioning of service delivery,&#13;
(d)   increase cost recovery of municipal investments; and&#13;
(e)   strengthen municipal financial management capacity, especially for effective&#13;
expenditure control and capital budgeting.&#13;
4.2   These project objectives have been explicitly defined in an Urban Development&#13;
Policy. The State is commited to strengthening local governments, through sound fiscal&#13;
and administrative management, accountability and efficiency in investments and current&#13;
expenditures and equity in service provision. As one of the key means of achieving these&#13;
goals, the State's intention is to reduce discretionary transfers to municipalities and instead&#13;
channel these funds as counterpart to the PRODUIR program, where they will be invested&#13;
according to clearly-defined criteria. Urban areas are expected to play a major part in the&#13;
future economic growth of the State.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.3   The project would consist of four primary components: Municipal Reform (MR)&#13;
(US$10.0 million, 4.5 % of total project costs); Institutional Development (ID) (US$10.0&#13;
million, 4.5% of total project costs); Urban Infrastructure (UI) (US$186.5 million, 84%&#13;
of costs); and poverty-targeted Urban Upgrading (UU) (US$15.5 million, 7% of project&#13;
costs). A detailed project description is provided in Annex 4A, and is summarized below.&#13;
Part Al: Municipal Reform (MR)&#13;
4.4   The Municipal Reform component, which is being tried on a pilot basis, would&#13;
finance basic reforms that would reduce the role of the municipal government in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
delivery of urban infrastructure and social services where appropriate. This is to be&#13;
accomplished through either privatizing or using private concessions for municipal&#13;
services such as water supply and sanitation, solid waste collection and disposal, bus and&#13;
other transport, operation of markets and slaughterhouses. Funds under the MR&#13;
component would finance: (i) the technical studies needed to define the reforms; (ii) the&#13;
actual costs of specialist assistance to implement the reforms (e.g., the cost of audit&#13;
specialists and investment firms); and (iii) the incremental recurrent cost of the actual&#13;
privatization or concession (for instance, if a municipality decided to privatize its solid&#13;
waste collection service, the loan could finance the cost of the transfer to the private entity&#13;
on a declining basis).&#13;
Part A2: Institutional Development (ID)&#13;
4.5    The institutional development (ID) component (Part B) consists of technical&#13;
assistance, training and equipment purchases for municipalities and for CAR, as well as&#13;
studies associated with the modernization and administrative reforms of the municipalities.&#13;
Needs would be evaluated in three areas: (a) fiscal and administrative; (b) planning; and&#13;
(c) training. The menu of possible ID interventions are shown in Table 3, and would&#13;
include, inter alia:&#13;
Table 3: Eligible Institutional Development Investments&#13;
Investments                    Description&#13;
Fiscal and Administrative      Upgrading property tax cadastres; improving procedures,&#13;
policies and physical infrastructure for billing and&#13;
collection of property and other taxes and tariffs; and&#13;
improving procurement procedures.&#13;
Planning                       Preparing and updating master plans; updating real&#13;
property mapping; and works and construction codes and&#13;
technical standards. Also included would be assistance&#13;
for preparation of environmental legislation and&#13;
strengthening local environmental councils.&#13;
Training                       Training in areas complementary to above, including&#13;
other priority areas such as environmental education.&#13;
4.6    Of the total of 415 municipalities in the State, it is expected that about 77 will&#13;
participate in the Municipal Reform and the Institutional Development components.&#13;
These would be the key to entry into the PRODUR program. Individualized technical&#13;
assistance and training plans for the MR and ID components would be developed for each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
municipality on the basis of a simple diagnostic questionnaire based on rapid-assessment&#13;
methodologies successfully employed in the South of Brazil and elsewhere.&#13;
4.7    Technical assistance interventions would be combined with on-the-job training, to&#13;
ensure effectiveness. On the basis of the diagnosis, a Municipal Reform and Institutional&#13;
Development Plan, or Plano de Reformas e de Modernizaqao InstitucionalMunicipal&#13;
(PRIM) would be prepared together with the executing agency, CAR. It would then be&#13;
discussed and agreed with each municipality in consultation with local groups and&#13;
representative bodies, setting specific targets for municipal reforms as well as for financial&#13;
and institutional improvements. To encourage participation in this initial phase of the&#13;
project, and ensure wide access to all municipalities, preparation of PRIMs would be&#13;
grant-financed. Once committed to such a satisfactory PRIM, municipalities would be&#13;
eligible for grants for technical assistance and training. Following initiation of this&#13;
process, and providing adequate creditworthiness (see paras. 5.9-5.10), client&#13;
municipalities would be eligible to apply for sub-loans for infrastructure investments.&#13;
Grants for technical assistance would be linked to performance standards regarding&#13;
resource mobilization, cost-recovery and management efficiency which, in turn, would be&#13;
linked to sub-project eligibility criteria for infrastructure (para. 5.16).&#13;
4.8    This approach builds on past sector work and project experience by establishing a&#13;
long-term plan for strengthening of local governments. Both the willingness to reform and&#13;
to undertake the institutional development components increase the level of commitment&#13;
for capacity strengthening of local governments by working through a state-level&#13;
institution which will develop a strategy, create procedures, set standards and norms to&#13;
facilitate institutional strengthening of municipalities. Implementation of technical&#13;
assistance and training would be done through private sector, university and other&#13;
providers, with standard-setting and supervision and monitoring by CAR, which over time&#13;
will shift to providing "wholesale" interventions aimed at fostering private sector delivery&#13;
of technical assistance and training.&#13;
Part B: Strengthening of CAR and poverty study&#13;
4.9    A technical assistance package has also been developed under this component that&#13;
would strengthen the CAR in this role. Also included would be a statewide poverty-&#13;
mapping effort which would enable the State to gauge the extent to which the needs of the&#13;
urban poor were being addressed by the project -- and make mid-term adjustments if&#13;
required -- as well as serving as an instrument to guide other State programs.&#13;
Part C: Urban Infrastructure (UI)&#13;
4.10   Urban infrastructure (UI) investments (Part C) would focus on basic urban&#13;
infrastructure for which municipalities typically do not have sufficient resources without&#13;
external financing. It is estimated that the 77 or so municipalities with urban populations&#13;
above 15,000 would be the universe among which clients would be drawn for the&#13;
infrastructure component. All these municipalities are expected to participate over the life&#13;
of the Bank-financed project. Sub-project investments would be fully repaid at long-term&#13;
market-approximating interest rates (para. 5.5), with full cost recovery via user charges&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
based on economic costs, or indirectly via increased property values and tax collection as&#13;
a result of infrastructure improvements (para. 7.6 and Annex 7). Investments shown in&#13;
Table 4 would be eligible:&#13;
Table 4: Eligible Infrastructure Components&#13;
Investments           Description&#13;
Urban        These would be the large primary investments, which would be carried out&#13;
Infrastructure    in an integrated fashion whenever possible (e.g., sewerage networks&#13;
togetlier with street paving and drainage).&#13;
Water       Water treatment and amplification of production; incremental network&#13;
extension and domestic connections; operational and commercial&#13;
improvements, such as metering, leak detection and rehabilitation of&#13;
equipment.&#13;
Sewerage         Equipment for treatment systems, extension of networks and domestic&#13;
connections. Well-tested, low-cost technologies, in particular in small&#13;
communities, would be encouraged.&#13;
Solid Waste      Solid waste collection equipment, construction of landfills, and equipment&#13;
for final disposal. In this component also well-tested, alternative low-cost&#13;
solutions would be encouraged.&#13;
Paving and     Street paving, macro- and micro-drainage, flood and erosion control,&#13;
Drainage      channeling of watercourses and vias sanitarias.&#13;
Complementary    A group of smaller-scale investments, which are usually done in&#13;
Investments     conjunction with the larger basic infrastructure investments above,&#13;
including, inter alia, street lighting, sidewalks and trees/shrubbery.&#13;
Regional      A small amount of funds would be available for well-justified regional&#13;
Investments     cooperative investments, such as multi-municipal landfills. The project also&#13;
includes the construction of municipal markets and slaughter houses as well&#13;
as the construction or expansion of air, road and water transport passenger&#13;
shelters and tourist bureaus.&#13;
Part D: Urban Upgrading (UU)&#13;
4.11  The urban upgrading component would be targeted to areas with average&#13;
household income below three minimum wages per month. The objective of the&#13;
component would be to provide a package of integrated urban infrastructure investments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
to low-income residents in the peripheral areas of cities and towns, where the bulk of the&#13;
urban poor are located. The component would be based on standardized designs and unit&#13;
costs and would be maraged by a special unit within CAR. Eligibility criteria would&#13;
include that: (a) beneficiary areas must be within a maximum threshold income level (for&#13;
example, three minimum salaries per month per household); (b) the investments would be&#13;
limited by a maximum project cost per capita; (b) investments should be integrated; (c)&#13;
community participation and organization would need to be demonstrated; (d) residents&#13;
would need to have possession of land title, or the area would be able to be converted, or&#13;
residents would need to have lived in the area for equal to or more than the amount of&#13;
time stipulated by law before titling becomes automatic. Since this is a new approach to&#13;
infrastructure service delivery in the State, the overall scope would be limited to US$15.5&#13;
million, and it would start small in the first year (limited to US$2.0 million). Publicity for&#13;
the program would include reference to the limited funds available under this component&#13;
for the first year, in order to stimulate demand. It was agreed that the municipalities would&#13;
contribute 15% of the cost of the urban upgrading component. The Bank loan will finance&#13;
45% of the total cost and the remaining 40% will be covered by the state. Both the World&#13;
Bank funding and the State contribution would be passed on to the municipalities as&#13;
grants.&#13;
C. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
4.12  Project Costs. The project cost table is shown in Table 5 below. As shown, total&#13;
project costs are estimated to be US$222.0 million equivalent, including taxes. The&#13;
proposed Bank loan of US$100.0 million equivalent would finance about 45% of total&#13;
costs (50% of costs less taxes). A detailed table of cost estimates is presented in Annex&#13;
4B.&#13;
4.13  Project costs would consist of about US$10.0 million equivalent (or 4.5% of&#13;
project costs) for each of the municipal reform and institutional development components;&#13;
US$186.5 million (or 84% of costs) for urban infrastructure; and about US$15.5 million&#13;
(about 7% of costs) for low-income urban upgrading. Costs have been calculated in&#13;
Brazilian reais (base costs of 1995 updated to May 1996) and converted to equivalent US&#13;
dollars at prevailing exchange rates. The aggregate scale of investments at the local level&#13;
was determined by the estimated demand for services, borrowing capacity of&#13;
municipalities, and counterpart payment capacity of the State and municipalities (see para.&#13;
6.8). A total of 77 municipalities have already been screened for the PRODTR program&#13;
and 14 sub projects have been appraised for inclusion in the first year program.&#13;

a/ Including about US$22.0 million in taxes.&#13;
4.14  The foreign exchange component is estimated to be about US$52.5 million (24%&#13;
of base costs). Indirect taxes are about US$22.0 million (10% of base costs) and will be&#13;
financed by the State. Due to the project's programmatic approach -- whereby the Bank&#13;
loan would finance a time-slice of municipal investments -- contingencies have not been&#13;
budgeted. Rough cost estimates for civil works are based on existing engineering designs&#13;
and unit costs of other similar investments in Brazil, supported by engineering estimates&#13;
and recent contract prices. Consultant service costs are based on prevailing local and&#13;
foreign person-month rates.&#13;
4.15  Financing Plan. The project financing plan is shown in Table 6 below. As&#13;
indicated, the project would be financed by the proposed loan, totaling US$100.0 million&#13;
(45% of project costs); by State resources of about US$88.8 million (40% of project&#13;
costs); and by municipal counterpart of about US$33.2 million (15% of project costs).&#13;
The proposed loan would finance all expected foreign exchange costs (about US$52.5&#13;
million). The loan would also finance about US$47.5 million of local expenditures, due to&#13;
the widespread availability of competitive locally-provided goods and services in Brazil.&#13;

D. THE BORROWER AND EXECUTING AGENCY&#13;
During Negotiations, agreement was reached on the project financing plan and the&#13;
Borrower's guarantee regarding necessary project counterpart funds&#13;

4.16  The State of Bahia. The Borrower would be the State of Bahia. The State would&#13;
use the proceeds of the Bank loan and its own counterpart funds to capitalize a municipal&#13;
development fund (FUNDlURBANO), to be managed by a commercial bank to be selected&#13;
under procedures to be agreed. A financial evaluation of the State is given in paras. 6. 1-&#13;
6.2.&#13;
4.17 The State's Companhia de Desenvolvimento e Avao Regional (CAR) would be the&#13;
project's executing agency. During Negotiations, agreement was reached that CAR would&#13;
execute Parts A-D of the project. CAR would have primary responsibility for all aspects&#13;
of project implementation, including evaluation of sub-borrowers' financial and&#13;
institutional capacity, diagnosis of institutional requirements and formulation of technical&#13;
assistance and training packages, evaluation of technical, economic and financial feasibility&#13;
of sub-projects, and all general aspects of management, operation and monitoring of the&#13;
project. These procedures would all be undertaken on the basis of agreed Operational&#13;
Manuals (para. 5.3). Environmental evaluations would be done through the State's Centro&#13;
de Recursos Ambientais (CRA; see para. 5.20 and Annex 5H).&#13;
4.18  CAR was created by State Law in 1983 as a public "autarky," and later&#13;
transformed into a public company in order to provide more flexibility in implementation&#13;
of its responsibilities. CAR's shares are wholly owned by the State. CAR's Executive&#13;
Director is appointed by the Governor. The Secretary of Planning serves as Chairman of&#13;
the Board of Directors. CAR is headquartered in the State's capital, Salvador, and has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
regional offices in seven medium-sized cities around the State. CAR has historically acted&#13;
primarily in the rural sector, and in this capacity has significant experience implementing&#13;
decentralized programs, including the World Bank-financed Northeast Rural Development&#13;
Program (or PAPP; Loans 2523-BR and 2524-BR). The implementation of the PAPP in&#13;
Bahia was in fact one of the most successful of these state-based programs. As of 1991,&#13;
CAR has also been given responsibility for the State's programs in urban areas. This is a&#13;
significant challenge for CAR, which has an excellent history and experience in the rural&#13;
sectors but which has relatively little experience in urban areas. A further challenge stems&#13;
from CAR's recent assumption of the responsibilities of technical assistance to&#13;
municipalities, a role previously performed by a now-defunct State company, CEMUR.&#13;
4.19  Detailed discussions have been held with the State and CAR regarding the&#13;
institutional capacity of the latter, and plans for strengthening capabilities in the urban&#13;
area. Plans include restructuring CAR into three Departments: (a) Regional Development&#13;
(for rural-oriented programs); (b) Urban Development; and (c) Municipal Action (for&#13;
support to institutional strengthening of local governments). The management and&#13;
infrastructure aspects as well as the institutional development and municipal reform&#13;
components of PRODUR would fall under the Urban Development Department. The&#13;
ongoing PAPP and its successor, the Northeast Rural Poverty Alleviation Program&#13;
(NRPA), would be handled by CAR's Regional Development division. CAR also has&#13;
plans to establish about 12 additional regional offices, in the context of the PRODUR and&#13;
NRPA projects.&#13;
4.20  Regarding specific project tasks, CAR has established a financial nucleus in the&#13;
Urban Development Department, which has been trained in public financial analysis, as&#13;
well as similar groups for economic and technical evaluation of sub-projects. It was&#13;
agreed that CAR would hire specialist consultants, as needed, to assist with project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
4.21   Status of Proiect Preparation. Project preparation began during the late 1980s by&#13;
a group in the office of the Secretary of Planning. Many of those involved in this initial&#13;
stage of preparation remain involved in the current State government administration;&#13;
continuity is an important factor in the advanced status of the project. Equally important,&#13;
CAR has hired consultants to assist in the preparation of the project: one to guide them in&#13;
the details of project implementation, and a specialized firm to assist in the preparation of&#13;
operating manuals. This seems a successful approach to project preparation which may be&#13;
replicable in other projects. Detailed designs for all first-year sub-projects are underway.&#13;
These and other documents related to project preparation are available in the Project File&#13;
(see Annex 8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM&#13;
5.1   The Bahia Municipal Infrastructure Development and Management Project&#13;
(PRODUJR) will support the development of municipal reforms and efficient financial&#13;
management capacity on the one hand, and priority infrastructure investments on the other&#13;
hand. The Institutiohal Development and Municipal Reform Components will be financed&#13;
by grants to the municipalities and the Infrastructure component will be financed through&#13;
an urban development fund. The project's reform component will ensure that the&#13;
municipalities in the state reduce their role in the delivery of urban services through&#13;
privatizing and concessioning of most of such services. Through the proposed project, the&#13;
Bank loan and State counterpart funds would capitalize the PRODUR Municipal&#13;
Development Fund (FUNDURBANO) which would on-lend resources to municipalities&#13;
for economically-viable urban infrastructure investments on the basis of well-defined sub-&#13;
borrower creditworthiness and sub-project eligibility criteria. To ensure that as many of&#13;
the municipalities as possible participate in the municipal reform and institutional&#13;
development components the Bank loan and the state counterpart will fully finance these&#13;
two project interventions on a grant basis. Poverty-targeted urban upgrading would be&#13;
financed by a combination of grants and local contributions (para 4.10).&#13;
5.2   While CAR would handle all day-to-day activities of PRODLUR, program policy&#13;
would be handled by a Board of Directors. The Board would be chaired by the State&#13;
Secretariat of Planning, and membership would include representatives from the&#13;
Secretariat of Finance, other government agencies, and the Association of Municipalities.&#13;
CAR would serve as the Executive Secretariat of the Board. The organization chart for&#13;
PRODUR is presented in Annex 5A. Institutional and implementation arrangements for&#13;
the proposed project are detailed in Annex 5B.&#13;
5.3   Operational arrangements, based on those developed under similar ongoing&#13;
programs in the states of Parana, Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais and Ceara, are set out&#13;
in the Program's Operational Manual (OM). The OM volumes include:&#13;
(a)   Orientation Manual;&#13;
(b)   Publicity Flier;&#13;
(c)   Guidelines for Evaluation of sub-borrowers,&#13;
(d)   Procurement Guidelines and Standard Bidding Documents,&#13;
(e)   Sub-Project Evaluation;&#13;
(f)    Disbursement Manual; and&#13;
(g)   Monitoring and Evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
Final versions were presented for review at Negotiations at which it was ageed that the&#13;
PRODVR program would be carried out in accordance with the Operational Manual&#13;
(OM). After initial testing the OM would be further simplified and summarized in small&#13;
leaflets which would be used in the future marketing of the program. The OM is&#13;
described further in Annex 5C.&#13;
B. THE PRODUR MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT F UND&#13;
5.4   The PRODUR Municipal Development Fund (FUNDURBANO) would be&#13;
established by State law (para. 5. 18). As noted, CAR, would perform all sub-project and&#13;
sub-borrower evaluations, and has experience in this type of review (paras. 4.17-4.20).&#13;
Loan administration and management of the fund would be undertaken by the state&#13;
development bank of Bahia, DESENBANCO. About US$84.0 million equivalent of the&#13;
Bank loan would capitalize the FUNDURBANO, together with State resources, in a two-&#13;
to-one proportion. This is equal to the full amount less about US$16.0 million, which,&#13;
together with State counterpart would finance the municipal reform and institutional&#13;
development as well as the low-income urban upgrading component, which would be&#13;
financed separately from the FUNDURBANO . The FUNDURBANO would on-lend to&#13;
municipalities and up to 85% of the cost of eligible infrastructure sub-projects. The&#13;
remaining counterpart (minimum 15%) would be provided by sub-borrowers, through&#13;
payment of invoices (or in-kind labor contributions, in the case of smaller municipalities).&#13;
5.5   Terms and Conditions. Sub-loans would be made to sub-borrowers in three&#13;
categories, with terms of up to five, 10 and 15 years (including grace periods of one to&#13;
three years), depending on the cost-recovery profile of the investments. Sub-loans would&#13;
carry an interest rate equal to the rates of the World Bank loan to Bahia plus a "spread"&#13;
of 3% yielding an estimated project average rate on the order of 10%). All sub-loan&#13;
balances, disbursements and repayments would be denominated in local currency. It was&#13;
agreed that local currency sub-loan amounts and balances would be adjusted for inflation&#13;
using the prevailing rate of inflation in Brazil as measured by the IGP-M or any other&#13;
adjustment index satisfactory to the Bank and Bahia. Table 6 presents sub-loan terms and&#13;
conditions for each type of investment.7&#13;

Water Production and Treatment, Sewage           up to        up to&#13;
Treatment, Solid Waste Disposal, Macro-Drainage.  15 years   3 years&#13;
5.6  It was agreed during Negotiations that sub-loans would be guaranteed by&#13;
municipalities' value-added tax (ICMS) revenues (or, in cases where this is insufficient, by&#13;
the municipal participation fund (FPM). If a case of non-payment occurs, requiring the&#13;
invoking of a guarantee, PRODUR would not re-lend to that sub-borrower until the&#13;
situation is satisfactorily resolved. In order to ensure a wide distribution of project&#13;
benefits, it was agreed during Negotiations that no single sub-borrower would be able to&#13;
borrow annually more than US$15 million, without prior consultation between the&#13;
Borrower and the Bank.&#13;
5.7   Flow of Funds. The Borrower has provided a diagram showing the projected flow&#13;
of funds from the various financing sources to CAR, the financial agent and sub-borrowers&#13;
(Annex SD); and a model which simulates funds flows on basis of the terms, estimated&#13;
lending, and returns to the FUNDURBANO over a 20-year period (available in the Project&#13;
File.) If the project is implemented according to schedule, the revolving nature of the&#13;
Fund would enable it to continue lending funds of roughly the same order of magnitude in&#13;
the five-year period following project completion as was lent during the peak of project&#13;
execution.&#13;
C. CAR's APPRAISAL PROCESS&#13;
5.8   CAR's Urban Department (DU) would handle all aspects of management and&#13;
operation of the PRODUR Program, including preparation of all sub-borrower and sub-&#13;
project appraisals according to selection criteria set out in the Operational Manual.&#13;
During appraisal, CAR presented the Bank with evidence of satisfactory increased staffing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
and computerization of the DU. Annex 5E sets out in detail CAR's appraisal process,&#13;
which is summarized below.&#13;
Sub-Borrower Eligibility Criteria&#13;
5.9    Given PRODUR's essentially reform and urban infrastructure objectives, it will&#13;
focus its activities principally in those municipalities with significant urban characteristics.&#13;
In addition to meeting the creditworthiness criteria (see Chapter 6) municipalities wishing&#13;
to participate in PRODUR would have to meet one of the following criteria: (i) have an&#13;
urban population of at least 15,000 in 1991 according to the census of the Instituto&#13;
Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics-&#13;
IBGE); or (ii) be one of the 33 strategic urban centers as defined in Bahia's Urban&#13;
Development Strategy.8 In addition, municipalitites with a debt capacity of US$1 million&#13;
are eligible independently of their population. It is expected that about 77 municipalities&#13;
will be eligible to participate in PRODUR. Full sub-borrower eligibility criteria are&#13;
detailed in the Program's Operational Manual. Key steps for entry are as follows:&#13;
(a)    signature of a Participation Agreement (Convenio de Adesao) which&#13;
formalizes municipal interest in PRODUR and commitment to its&#13;
principles;&#13;
(b)    completion of an assessment of the potential for municipal reform as well&#13;
as an institutional and financial diagnosis, according to the rapid&#13;
assessment methodology developed and tested under similar programs in&#13;
other states;&#13;
(c)    establishment of an agreed set of institution-building actions, with clearly-&#13;
defined performance targets;&#13;
5.10   To undertake infrastructure sub-loans, municipalities and water agencies would&#13;
have to meet the following additional creditworthiness criteria:&#13;
(a)    demonstrated compliance with Federal legislation on payment of taxes and&#13;
other obligations;&#13;
(b)    a clear demonstration that either:&#13;
(i)    the municipality's primary surplus during the preceding year is at&#13;
least 15% of its total revenues (excluding credit); or&#13;
s   These cities are highlighted in the State's current Urban Development Strategy because of their&#13;
potential for economic development related to major industrial or infrastructure projects or tourism.&#13;
Thirty strategic cities (with urban population of less than 15,000) are included: Conde, Jandaira,&#13;
Cachoeira, Sao Felix, Camamu, Ubaitaba, Alcobaca, Caravelas, Mucuri, Nova Vicosa, Prado, Santa&#13;
Cruz de Cabralia, Araci, Jeremoaba, Monte Santo, Tucano, Riachao do Jacuipe, Curaca, Andarai,&#13;
Boquira, Lencois, Macaubas, Mucuge, Rio de Contas, Riacho de Santana, Correntina, Formoso do&#13;
Rio Preto, Riachao das Neves, Santana, Livramento do Brumado, Santo Se, Capim Grosso and Sao&#13;
Desiderio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
(ii)   total outstanding and proposed debt and guarantees do not exceed&#13;
total municipal revenues (excluding credit) of the previous year,&#13;
adjusted for inflation;&#13;
(c)    demonstrate that it has adequate counterpart funds (minimum 15 % of the&#13;
cost of the sub-project);&#13;
(d)    show adequate mechanisms for cost recovery; and&#13;
(e)    provide a state or national transfer as subloan guarantee.&#13;
Sub-Project Eligibility Criteria&#13;
5.11   Sub-project eligibility criteria are set out in the OM. During Negotiations it was&#13;
agreed that all sub-projects would undergo technical, economic, financial and&#13;
environmental evaluation by a team of CAR staff.&#13;
5.12   Technical evaluation involves analysis of demand for the service, and&#13;
demonstration that the chosen alternative is the least-cost means of meeting demand. This&#13;
evaluation would be performed by CAR's technical unit, which would be comprised of&#13;
urban engineers, with the assistance of specialized consultants as necessary (for example&#13;
for solid waste disposal, or alternative sewage treatment). Proposals will be returned to&#13;
municipalities for revision if necessary. In the case of sewage treatment and solid waste&#13;
disposal sub-projects, low-cost, well-tested9 alternative technologies such as anaerobic&#13;
sewage treatment should be encouraged, where appropriate.&#13;
5.13   Economic cost-benefit analysis would be carried out to determine project viability.&#13;
The minimum criteria for sub-projects would be that they provide an internal economic&#13;
rate of return (IERR) which meets or exceeds the opportunity cost of capital, estimated at&#13;
12%. In the case of revenue-earning services, such as water, sewerage and public lighting,&#13;
economic benefits would be calculated on the basis of tariff revenues as a proxy for&#13;
willingness to pay. In the case of non-revenue earning services, such as drainage and&#13;
paving, economic benefits would be based on increased land values as a result of the&#13;
infrastructure improvements. For those sub-projects estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$500,000, estimation of per capita benefits would be sufficient, providing the technical&#13;
solution is least-cost and benefits are shown to be largely within the municipality. Health&#13;
benefits would also be quantified using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as a measure&#13;
for sewerage treatment and macro drainage sub-projects (para. 7.6).&#13;
5.14   Financial cost-benefit analysis would provide the basis for determining cost-&#13;
recovery. All infrastructure sub-projects (with the exception of some sewage treatment&#13;
and solid waste disposal), are expected to achieve full cost recovery. Sub-project&#13;
investments would be linked to specific targets to increase user fees and taxes, to be&#13;
Several Brazilian States and localities (i.e. the State of Parana) have developed simple low-cost&#13;
primary sewage treatment, for example, which have been well-tested, with favorable results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
agreed with municipalities in the PRIM and reflected in the terms and conditions of sub-&#13;
loans for infrastructure investments.&#13;
5.15  Environmental Screening. All necessary environmental evaluation and assessment&#13;
would be part of required documentation (para. 5.20 and Annex 5F). Environmental&#13;
assessments, where required, would be completed by private consultants, evaluated by&#13;
CRA and submitted to CAR prior to signature of sub-loan contracts.&#13;
5.16  Infrastructure investments would be linked to specific institutional development&#13;
and/or municipal reform interventions. For example, investments in solid waste collection&#13;
and disposal, if determined to be a municipal priority and economically viable, could be&#13;
accompanied by appropriate increases in the relevant user charges and/or taxes, technical&#13;
assistance in zoning and land-use, in the improved enforcement of local environmental&#13;
regulations and training for involved staff at the local level. In this way, the institutional&#13;
development and infrastructure components would be fully complementary. For each sub-&#13;
borrower, a team of one engineer, one economist/financial analyst and one institutional&#13;
specialist will be assigned to work together with local authorities, from diagnosis and&#13;
PRIM to evaluation and supervision of the infrastructure investments.&#13;
Review Procedure&#13;
5.17   Given the large number of small and medium-sized sub-projects expected during&#13;
this project, CAR would undertake the evaluation of municipal sub-components beyond&#13;
those evaluated during appraisal according to agreed criteria set out in the program's&#13;
Operational Manual10 Below these amounts ex-post reviews, on the basis of spot-&#13;
checking, would be undertaken during supervision. Sub-projects would be considered for&#13;
review until three months before the project's Closing Date.&#13;
D. LEGAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
5.18  Implementation arrangements for the project would be formalized in the following&#13;
legal documents and other minutes of understanding:&#13;
(a)    State law authorizing the State to borrow from the Bank'&#13;
(b)    State law establishing the FUNDURBANO;&#13;
(c)    State decree regulating the FUNDURBANO;&#13;
(d)   Contract(s) between the State of Bahia, CAR and the financial agent(s);&#13;
(e)   Model participation agreement (conWvnio de adesdo) between the State,&#13;
CAR and municipality;&#13;
0  It should be noted that this review is separate from the prior review thresholds for procurement&#13;
(para. 5.25) and disbursement (para. 5.27).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
(f)    Model negotiation agreement (minute of understanding) between CAR and&#13;
municipality (for the municipal reform and/or institutional development&#13;
component);&#13;
(g)   Model Sub-Loan Contract between the financial agent, CAR and&#13;
municipality for on-lending fund in support of a sub-project;&#13;
(h)   Model Grant Agreement between the State and the municipality for&#13;
retransmitting funds to support a municipal reform and/or institutional&#13;
development, or to partially support an urban upgrading component; and&#13;
(i)    Model municipal law authorizing a municipality to participate in PRODUR.&#13;
5.19  Drafts of all of these documents have been prepared. Agreement on the final&#13;
version of the model Sub-Loan Contracts and Grant Agreements was reached at&#13;
Negotiations. It was further agreed that all conditions present in the legal agreements&#13;
between the Bank and CAR, the State and the Federal Government, would be reflected in&#13;
the sub-agreements, as necessary.&#13;
E. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
5.20   Specific guidelines for evaluation of municipal projects with environmental impact&#13;
have been established by the State environmental agency, Centro de Recursos Ambientais&#13;
(CRA) for the purposes of the project. The new rules establish guidelines for&#13;
environmental screening by project size and expected impact (on the basis of physical&#13;
measures, such as pipe size for water and sewerage). These guidelines are roughly&#13;
comparable to similar ones in other states, and are compatible with both federal&#13;
government law and Bank guidelines. There are three categories: the first, for projects of&#13;
significant size and impact, would be a full environmental impact assessment and report&#13;
(EIA/RIMA); the second category, for projects of smaller size and impact, would be a&#13;
simplified environmental assessment, or environmental control report (RCA). The third&#13;
category of investments would require only licensing. Environmental assessments under&#13;
the project will be prepared by private consultants and reviewed by CRA. The&#13;
Operational Manual would stipulate that environmental assessment would be conducted as&#13;
needed, consistent with Brazilian law and Bank guidelines, prior to signature of sub-loan&#13;
contracts. It was agreed that EIA/RIMAs and RCAs would have been completed for sub-&#13;
projects with environmental impact," consistent with Brazilian and State laws and Bank&#13;
guidelines, prior to any disbursement on the relevant component. It was also agreed that&#13;
the Bank would have prior review of any resettlement plans. Furthermore, the state&#13;
government would prepare and adopt an acceptable framework for resettlement plans by&#13;
August 31, 1997. None of the 14 sub-projects to be implemented during the first year&#13;
involves resettlement. CAR would provide technical assistance to municipalities and&#13;
oversee the environmental screening process, from selection of consultants (for which it&#13;
will maintain an open data base of firms) to subsequent evaluation by CRA. CAR will also&#13;
l Although not foreseen under the project, this would include any impact and plans for resettlement, if&#13;
necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
maintain an agreed model terms of reference for environmental assessments, prepared in&#13;
conjunction with CRA and the Bank (Annex 5F). CRA is being strengthened to perform&#13;
its role under the recently-approved Pollution Control Project for the Bahia de Todos os&#13;
Santos, financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Significant involuntary&#13;
resettlement (more than 100-200 individuals) is not foreseen under this project. In the&#13;
even that any such resettlement is proposed in the course of project implementation,&#13;
however, the state and CAR agreed that any sub-project involving such resettlement&#13;
would be subject to the prior review and appraisal of the Bank prior to disbursement, and&#13;
that resettlement plans satisfactory to the Bank would be prepared.&#13;
F. PROCUREMENT&#13;
5.21   All procurement of goods and works would be carried out following the World&#13;
Bank's Guidelinesfor Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (published in&#13;
January 1995 and revised in January 1996). Civil works under the proposed project&#13;
would represent about US$ 124.0 million, or 56% of total project costs; equipment and&#13;
materials about US$77.7 million, or 35%; and consultant services, including technical&#13;
assistance, training, studies, engineering design and works supervision, about US$20.4&#13;
million, or 9% of costs. Proposed procurement arrangements for the project are&#13;
summarized in Table 8. Annex 5G provides estimated profiles for sub-project contracts&#13;
5.22   Civil Works. The estimated value for civil works contracts is US$124.0 million.&#13;
Due to the nature of the project, there will be a number of small contracts as well as larger&#13;
ones. Most contracts will be scattered throughout municipalities in the State and average&#13;
US$100,000 - US$3.0 million in value, with a few exceptions of works for larger projects,&#13;
expected to cost over US$5.0 million. It is expected that the smaller, dispersed contracts&#13;
will not be attractive to foreign bidders. It was agreed that all contracts for civil works&#13;
estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$5.0 million, and up to an aggregate value&#13;
of US$15 rnillion per beneficiary, will be procured on the basis of national competitive&#13;
bidding (NCB) procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Procurement under NCB will use the&#13;
standard bidding documents for Brazil agreed with the Bank. Foreign firms will be&#13;
allowed to participate in the bidding. Above these limits, procurement would be carried&#13;
out on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB), using standard bidding&#13;
documents issued by the Bank. For small works costing US$350,000 or less, all contracts&#13;
would be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written&#13;
invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including basic&#13;
specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award shall be made to the&#13;
contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has the&#13;
experience and resources to successfully complete the contract&#13;

5.23  Goods. Purchase of equipment and materials is expected to total about US$77.7&#13;
million under the project. The majority of these purchases will be small machinery,&#13;
equipment and materials necessary for the installation of infrastructure services, and pipes,&#13;
connections, water meters and other equipment associated with domestic water and&#13;
sewerage connections. While a large number of contracts are estimated to range between&#13;
US$50,000 and US$250,000, there will be some scope for economy-of-scale purchasing&#13;
of equipment, and a special effort will be made to identify ICB packages above these&#13;
limits. It was agreed that all contracts for equipment and materials estimated to cost less&#13;
than the equivalent of US$250,000, and not exceeding an aggregate value per beneficiary&#13;
of US$3 million, would be procured on the basis of NCB procedures satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank, with foreign firms allowed to participate in the bidding. Above these limits,&#13;
procurement will be carried out on the basis of ICB using standard bidding documents&#13;
issued by the Bank. ICB documents would indicate that domestic preference would apply&#13;
in bid evaluation. National shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank would be&#13;
allowable for small equipment purchases estimated to cost the equivalent of less than&#13;
US$50,000, up to an aggregate of US$250.000 per beneficiary.&#13;
5.24  Consultant Services. All technical assistance, studies, training, detailed&#13;
engineering design and construction supervision contracts, amounting in total to about&#13;
US$20.4 million, will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the UJse of&#13;
Consultants (August 198]), including proposals from foreign and local firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
5.25  The GOB's procurement regulations and procedures have been revised through a&#13;
new procurement law (No. 8,666 of June 21, 1993). The new law improves a number of&#13;
procedures, and it specifically authorizes executing agencies to procure goods and services&#13;
financed by multilateral institutions in accordance with the norms and procedures of the&#13;
institutions. But it also includes some provisions which are or can be interpreted as&#13;
diverging from Bank procurement policy. However, standard bidding documents for NCB&#13;
for goods and works have been recently agreed with GOB (April 1995), and most of these&#13;
differences have been resolved. Special provisions applicable to NCB procedures were&#13;
agreed during Negotiations and incorporated into the Loan Agreement. Procurement&#13;
under the project would be overseen by CAR's urban department, and managed by&#13;
individual municipalities.&#13;
5.26  Standard bidding documents and contracts for civil works and services under NCB&#13;
and local quotation methods have been prepared and are set out in the Operational&#13;
Manual. A model letter of invitation and standard contract for consultant services is also&#13;
be included in the Operational Manual. All procurement under ICB (about 22% of total&#13;
project costs) will be subject to prior Bank review of advertising, bidding documents, bid&#13;
evaluation and contract awards. In the interest of expediting project execution, all&#13;
procurement under NCB would be reviewed by CAR. However, NCB procurement for&#13;
works expected to cost US$2.0 million and above, and totaling US$63.8 million, would be&#13;
subject to the Bank's prior review. The proposed arrangements would provide prior-&#13;
review coverage of about 56% of the total cost of Bank-financed goods and works&#13;
(Annex 5G). This coverage is considered appropriate. A general announcement of the&#13;
types and sizes of contracts to be awarded during the subsequent one-to-two year period&#13;
would be published at the start of each year in the journal Development Business and in&#13;
newspapers of wide national circulation in Brazil. Agreement was reached on these&#13;
procurement arrangements at Negotiations.&#13;
G. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
5.27  The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed according to the following&#13;
categories and percentages:&#13;
(i)   for sub-loans or grants for infrastructure investments, 53% of the&#13;
applicable disbursement under the sub-loan or grant, and 100% of&#13;
the sub-loan or grant amounts in the case of foreign expenditures,&#13;
excluding taxes;&#13;
(ii)  for grants for institutional development or municipal reform sub-&#13;
projects, 45% of amounts disbursed from the grant of 100% of the&#13;
amount of the grant in case of foreign expenditures;&#13;
(iii)  for goods purchased in connection with the institutional&#13;
strengthening of CAR, 50%; and&#13;
(iv)  for consultant services to strengthen CAR and for the studies to be&#13;
undertaken by CAR, 100% of total expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
5.28  Disbursements are expected to be completed over a six-year period, as reflected in&#13;
Annex 5H. A disbursement schedule somewhat shorter than the regional profile of seven&#13;
years is justified by the experience and competence of the executing agency and the&#13;
project's timing within the local electoral cycle. The Project's expected Completion Date&#13;
is September 30, 2001, and Closing Date is March 31, 2002.&#13;
5.29  In order to ensure efficient and timely implementation of the project, it was agreed&#13;
during Negotiations that a Special Account with an authorized allocation of US$7.0&#13;
million equivalent would be established in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank and&#13;
the Borrower. The initial allocation for the Special Account will be US$5 million until&#13;
disbursements reach US$30 million. Because the project would involve a substantial&#13;
number of small contracts, disbursement for civil works contracts amounting to less than&#13;
US$2.0 million, for purchase of goods amounting to less than $350,000 and for consultant&#13;
services from firms amounting to less than US$100,000 and for consultant services from&#13;
individuals for less than US$50,000, would not require the Bank's prior review and would&#13;
be made under the Statement of Expenditures (SOE), as well as subloans and grants,&#13;
procedure, prepared and certified by CAR, which has adequate accounting controls for&#13;
this purpose. Expenditures for contracts above these limits would be documented. All&#13;
documentation would be retained by the DU for inspection during Bank supervision and&#13;
be subject to review of external auditors. Because several sub-projects are well-advanced,&#13;
retroactive financing of up to 5% of the loan amount for eligible expenditures incurred not&#13;
more than twelve months prior to Loan Signature, would be made. During Negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached on these disbursement arrangements.&#13;
H. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
5.30  The accounts of CAR, the project's executing agency, are examined annually by&#13;
private external auditors, as well as State-level government auditing bodies. Accounting&#13;
practices and procedures, including the chart of accounts, have been reviewed and found&#13;
satisfactory. During Negotiations agreement was reached on the following accounting and&#13;
audit arrangements: (a) that the financial agent would maintain a separate, consolidated&#13;
project account of sub-project expenditures for monitoring and audit purposes, to be&#13;
audited along with CAR corporate accounts by private external auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Bank; and (b) that the project accounts of participating municipalities be maintained&#13;
separately, and be subject to annual audits by the State's Tribunal de Clonias, or&#13;
Accounting Tribunal, provided it continues to meet adequate standards of independence,&#13;
capacity, and timeliness. The Tribunal de Contas of Bahia has been evaluated by the Bank&#13;
as having the necessary independence. The reports under (a) would be furnished to the&#13;
Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year. Agreement would also be sought&#13;
that a summary of key issues noted in individual municipal audits would be prepared&#13;
annually by qualified consultants and furnished to the Bank no later than eight months&#13;
after the end of the fiscal year. This annual report would be financed under the&#13;
Institutional Development component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
I. MONITORING, MID-TERM REVIEW AND EVALUATION&#13;
5.31  In addition to CAR's site visits, sub-borrowers would be expected to present periodic&#13;
progress reports on project implementation (with periodicity established in sub-loan contracts),&#13;
on the basis of which CAR would furnish concise quarterly progress reports to the Bank. These&#13;
reports would compare actual and forecast progress. The detailed range of project monitoring&#13;
indicators is provided in the OM. These include standard agreed performance indicators&#13;
monitoring physical, financial and operational progress of individual sub-projects, and&#13;
aggregated project performance for all sub-projects. A set of "key impact indicators" and&#13;
targets, selected from among the group of indicators to be monitored during the project, would&#13;
be agreed, including inter alia: (a) number of Participation Agreements signed; (b) number of&#13;
PRIMs completed; (c) overall project completion, measured in expenditures; (d) discretionary&#13;
transfers as a percent of total State transfers to municipalities; and (e) average property tax per&#13;
capita in the State (see Annex 5I). These indicators, among others, would be monitored in&#13;
quarterly reports. Agreement was reached during Negotiations that quarterly reports be&#13;
furnished no later than 30 days after the end of each of the following quarters: March 31, June&#13;
30 and September 30, and an annual report would be prepared for the December 31 period, to&#13;
be furnished within two months of year-end. These reports would include, inter alia, the&#13;
monitoring indicators set out in the OM, as well as a forecast investment plan. Reporting&#13;
requirements would begin with the first full quarter following Loan Effectiveness.&#13;
5.32  In order to review project progress, and if necessary reorient implementation, agreement&#13;
would be sought during Negotiations that a Mid-Term Review would be scheduled&#13;
approximately three years after Loan Effectiveness. Agreement was reached that the Borrower,&#13;
through CAR, would prepare and furnish to the Bank an Implementation Completion Report&#13;
within six months after the Closing Date. The supervision plan for the project (Annex 5K)&#13;
includes key specific objectives of the mid-term review.&#13;
J. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
5.33   Annex 5J presents the proposed project's agreed implementation schedule, which&#13;
outlines key actions in project execution for smooth implementation. This will be further&#13;
detailed through the use of project management software, to be established and programmed&#13;
during the project's inception mission. Of primary importance are targets for Participation&#13;
Agreements with municipalities, procurement of major works, and progress on technical&#13;
assistance interventions. This schedule is to be prepared on a rolling quarterly basis.&#13;
Arrangements for project supervision are outlined in the supervision plan in Annex 5K Physical&#13;
project supervision will be carried out by the regional offices of CAR, the DU and its&#13;
consultants on the basis of site checks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. STATE FINANCES&#13;
6.1    A detailed review of the financial situation and creditworthiness of the State of&#13;
Bahia was carried out using the methodology developed in sector work on Brazilian State&#13;
Debt12 This review showed that the previous State administration embarked on a policy of&#13;
sound financial management which placed the State of Bahia in a relatively stable financial&#13;
condition, despite macroeconomic difficulties at the national level. Beginning in 1991,&#13;
State officials designed a plan to put the State's financial house in order. A Federal law of&#13;
November 1993 (No. 8,727) gave the States a window of opportunity to reschedule&#13;
certain debts, an opportunity fully exploited by Bahia. Approximately US$1.5 billion of&#13;
State debt was rescheduled. In addition, virtually all of the debt owed by the State&#13;
treasury to BANEB, and thence by BANEB to federal financial institutions, was&#13;
transformed into a loan owed directly by the State treasury to the Federal treasury, thus&#13;
ending the conflict inherent in the State's borrowing from its own bank. Previous to this,&#13;
the State's financial management could be characterized as poor, with persistent current&#13;
account deficits until 1987. Beginning in 1990, however, the current account surpluses&#13;
have been significant. Since 1989, revenues have increased in real terms by 45% following&#13;
the fiscal reforms of the 1988 Constitution,&#13;
6.2   The finances of the state have improved remarkably as a result of the above&#13;
measures. Further efforts to streamline administrative management, monitor costs more&#13;
closely and strengthen personnel management could result in even more improvements.&#13;
For instance, while there is a freeze on hiring, personnel expenses continue to be high with&#13;
no mechanism for dismissing staff or for re-allocating staff with specific skills to areas of&#13;
their comparative advantage. Likewise the budgetary process, specifically with respect to&#13;
internally financed capital investments, could benefit from a more rational allocation&#13;
system.&#13;
6.3   The State's financial situation is set out in the tables in Annex 6A. In 1995, the&#13;
creditworthiness study showed the following results:&#13;
(a)   total current revenues = US$2.8 billion.&#13;
(b)   current account surplus = S$427 million.&#13;
(c)   primary surplus = US$185 million&#13;
(d)   primary surplus/ revenue = 6.6%.&#13;
12  World Bank, Brazil: State Debt: Crisis and Reform, Report No. 14842-BR, Washington, November&#13;
14, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
6.4   The State is promoting greater municipal financial independence and autonomy,&#13;
and considers the proposed project a key instrument for achieving greater municipal fiscal&#13;
responsibility.&#13;
B. MUNICIPAL FINANCES&#13;
6.5   Following the decentralization in 1988, resources and expenditures of Brazilian&#13;
municipalities both increased substantially. Municipal revenues rose from about 11% of&#13;
the country's total disposition of final revenue (average over the last two decades) to&#13;
about 17% in 1990. Expenditures increased from about 11% of final disposition to about&#13;
14% of the total. While these data indicate the relative importance municipalities have&#13;
assumed in the overall economy, the specific effects are not yet fully clear. Larger&#13;
municipalities seem to have benefited disproportionately more than smaller municipalities,&#13;
as did those with a larger industrial base over those with weaker economies. Most&#13;
municipalities, however, are much better off financially following the reforms. This can&#13;
have a perverse impact on own resources, however, with those cities receiving the highest&#13;
valued-added tax transfers from the State, for example, allowing own revenue collection&#13;
to decrease during the period.&#13;
6.6   Data for selected municipalities in Bahia reveal their considerable dependence on&#13;
federal and State government transfers, as is the case in most of the rest of Brazil. The&#13;
most significant municipal transfer components are: (a) the municipal participation fund&#13;
(FPM); and (b) the State value-added tax (ICMS). On average, Federal transfers of FPM&#13;
and State transfers of ICMS made up 85% of total municipal revenues in Bahia in 1992.&#13;
While FPM was significant in poorer municipalities, ICMS was more important in the&#13;
Salvador metropolitan region, which accounts for about 70% of Bahia industrial output.&#13;
Both the FPM and the ICMS are dependent on the level of economic activity. When&#13;
economic activity is slow, transfers are adversely affected; the narrower the municipal tax&#13;
collection base, the more serious the impact. This situation highlights the importance of&#13;
own collection capacity, which in turn depends on both the incentive structure and on&#13;
municipalities' restructuring of their administrative and financial framework so as to be&#13;
able to better exploit their tax potential.&#13;
6.7   Table 9 below indicates municipal revenue sources on the basis of a sample of 66&#13;
municipalities. As shown, own-source revenues, primarily represented by IPTU and ISS,&#13;
represented on average about 10% of total revenues in 1992. The project would generate&#13;
increased own revenue through criteria that would ensure cost-recovery through user&#13;
charges, betterment fees, and property and other taxes.&#13;
&#13;

6.8   Debt Capacity. Most of the smaller municipalities borrowed relatively little before&#13;
the advent of the Plano Real. In fact, most of the 44 municipalities had no contracted debt&#13;
in 1993. Most "financing" was done by arrears in the hyperinflationary period. There was&#13;
however, some borrowing through infrastructure lines of credit operated by the GOB&#13;
through CEF, especially by the larger municipalities. PRODUR will be the first chance for&#13;
large-scale municipal borrowing in the State. Municipalities in general are creditworthy,&#13;
since they have not previously borrowed and are now better off than previously.&#13;
However, there are several large municipalities which are significantly leveraged, and must&#13;
borrow with extreme caution.&#13;
6.9   Estimates of total existing debt capacity for 202 municipalities eligible to&#13;
participate in PRODUR were prepared with 1993 data from a representative sample of 44&#13;
municipalities These estimates show a total existing debt capacity of nearly US$214&#13;
million for the municipalities (Annex 6B). The data show that about 70 municipalities&#13;
would have a limit greater than US$1 million per year, while the remainder would have&#13;
annual capacity between about US$500,000 and US$1 million.&#13;
C. COST RECOVERY POLICY&#13;
6.10  Subprojects would have to demonstrate significant direct cost or indirect cost&#13;
recovery. Services which are revenue-earning (water supply, sewerage, solid waste&#13;
collection) would recover costs directly from final beneficiaries through tariffs and user&#13;
charges, while services which are non-revenue earning (paving and drainage, for example)&#13;
would be recovered through increases in property valuation and subsequent property and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
betterment taxes. Revenue-earning services constitute 47 % of the total infrastructure&#13;
program, while non-revenue-earning account for the rest. Annex 6C contains a breakdown of&#13;
the direct and indirect cost-recovery instruments for all components.&#13;
D. DIMENSIONING OF PRODUR&#13;
6.11  In order to dimension investments for the PRODUR program, the State and CAR&#13;
evaluated several key areas: demand for resources; municipal and State capacity to borrow&#13;
and repay loan funds; and State and municipal technical, institutional and financial absorptive&#13;
capacity. First, as part of project preparation, in 1994, CAR undertook a survey of 66 of the&#13;
State's larger cities, representing about six million inhabitants, or about 50% of the population.&#13;
The study confirmed that the most widely demanded investments were water supply, sewage&#13;
collection and treatment, solid waste collection and disposal, street paving and drainage, and&#13;
identified potential investments on the order of US$250.0 million. Second, CAR prepared an&#13;
evaluation of the credit limits of a sample of 44 of the State's municipalities, which indicates a&#13;
State-wide limit on the order of US$500 million. Finally, the State Government demonstrated&#13;
in its historic financial statements that for the past several years it has been spending on the&#13;
order of US$600.0 million on annual capital investments, largely in urban infrastructure. It is&#13;
the equivalent of these funds which would go into the FUNDURBANO as State counterpart.&#13;
The proposed project size of US$222.0 million for infrastructure and institutional&#13;
development investments over a six-year period (or about US$37.0 million per year) was&#13;
based on these findings. With State counterpart of about US$72.0 million (about US$12.0&#13;
million per year) and about US$50.0 million from municipalities (about US$8.0 million per&#13;
year) to be provided each year, the project is conservatively dimensioned. Simulations&#13;
indicate that about 77 of the State's municipalities (those with population greater than&#13;
15,000) will participate in the project.&#13;
E. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
6.12  Cost recovery at the sub-project level, and the fact that the Bank loan would be repaid&#13;
by the State (making Bank funds a permanent capitalization of the FUNDURBANO) increase&#13;
the project's chances of putting the financing of municipal investments on a more sustainable&#13;
basis through this fund. Furthermore, the project's reform components are expected to lead&#13;
to strengthened municipal management thus allowing the municipalities to cover their current&#13;
expenditures, service their debt and generate surpluses for future infrastructure investments.&#13;
The commitment of the government of the State of Bahia to project objectives is a primary&#13;
factor contributing to the likely sustainability of the project's impact on municipal finance.&#13;
The effective mobilization of community involvement in the definition of local investment&#13;
priorities by an experienced executing agency is an important factor in assuring that the&#13;
project's impact will be obtained initially and sustained after project completion. In addition,&#13;
the proposed project is designed to benefit from the lessons of experience of seven successful&#13;
municipal management projects in other states in Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
7. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
7.1   The expected benefit of the project will be to endow the State of Bahia with model&#13;
municipalities in terms of efficient urban service delivery and sound finances whose&#13;
institutional arrangements can be emulated elsewhere. These model municipalities would&#13;
pursue a combined policy of privatization of these services where possible and of&#13;
increased public sector efficiency at the local level through pilot programs of municipal&#13;
reform. Strengthened municipal finances should result from applying the project's rigorous&#13;
eligibility criteria for sub-project financing itself, in addition to specific municipal reform&#13;
and institutional actions directly supported by the project.&#13;
7.2   Through the experience of these model municipalities, it is also expected that the&#13;
project will demonstrate that the improvement of the living conditions of the urban poor in&#13;
the State of Bahia--through the efficient provision of infrastructure and services--can be&#13;
compatible with municipal reform. As a priority, project funding will finance cost-effective&#13;
sub-projects with high rates of return in municipalities whose administrations are&#13;
committed to reform. The urban poor will benefit most from the low-cost solutions to&#13;
urban infrastructure and service delivery favored by the project. For being sanitation-&#13;
related, the positive impacts of these investments upon the urban environment throughout&#13;
the State of Bahia should lead to significant public health improvements for the urban&#13;
poor.&#13;
7.3   PRODLJR's sub-project screening and evaluation procedures--involving technical,&#13;
economic, financial and environmental assessments--would help ensure that the expected&#13;
benefits are achieved.&#13;
A. FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT AND MUNICIPAL REFORM&#13;
7.4   The proposed project would strengthen the financial management of local&#13;
governments, enabling them to better provide the services for which they are responsible&#13;
under Brazil's Constitution, thus putting into effect the federal and state governments'&#13;
decentralization objectives. To become eligible for sub-project financing under PRODUR,&#13;
municipalities will have to meet rigorous creditworthiness criteria, itself an important&#13;
incentive to increasing revenues and savings at the local level. Specific project&#13;
components, such as the cadastre, will help broaden the fiscal base of municipalities. The&#13;
project will also encourage user charges to be levied at the local level for urban services&#13;
financed through PRODUR. Through focusing more upon economically and financially&#13;
viable investment projects, municipalities will have more opportunities to increase own-&#13;
source revenues through appropriate taxes and user charges based on economic costs, and&#13;
improved collection practices.&#13;
7.5   The project's pilot municipal reform program would also strengthen local&#13;
governments institutionally through a pilot program of municipal reform. Through&#13;
PRODUR, municipalities will be encouraged to privatize revenue-generating services&#13;
through the sale of assets or the granting of concessions to private operators. Participating&#13;
municipalities would enjoy more efficient public administration through implementing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
reform measures agreed under PRODUR. In this way the proposed project would also&#13;
support the federal government's overall macro economics objectives of achieving leaner,&#13;
more efficient public sector management at all levels.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC BENEFITS&#13;
7.6   The weighted-average internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the&#13;
infrastructure component is expected to be on the order of 20%. Calculation of the&#13;
project IERR is be based on the individual IERRs for a range of sub-projects for one&#13;
municipality with the most advanced first year program of investments. Estimates of the&#13;
ERRs of sub-projects of the remaining cities' first year programs would be prepared by&#13;
Loan Effectiveness. During project implementation, such cost-benefit analysis would be&#13;
prepared for all infrastructure sub-projects, accounting for about 84% of the total value of&#13;
PRODUR investments. On the basis of the experience other similar programs in Brazil, the&#13;
range of returns for individual sub-projects is expected to be on the order of 12% to 50%.&#13;
Sub-project selection criteria ensure a minimum 12% economic rate of return for all sub-&#13;
projects, with the exception of sewage treatment and macro drainage, for which health&#13;
benefits would also be calculated with the use of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs:&#13;
details Annex 7). Detailed economic cost-benefit and sensitivity analyses are presented in&#13;
Annex 7. Through guiding local governments to make efficient investments in urban&#13;
infrastructure and services, the project can contribute to improvements that will make&#13;
cities more attractive for investment by the private sector.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH BENEFITS&#13;
7.7   Because its infrastructure component is focused on the basic sanitation sectors, the&#13;
project is expected to have positive environmental impacts primarily derived from&#13;
improvements to solid waste collection and disposal, storm drainage, sewage collection&#13;
and treatment, water supply systems through reduced leakage and increased coverage, and&#13;
from a more integrated approach to management of sanitation services at the municipal&#13;
level. The technical assistance component may finance, among other things, the drafting of&#13;
municipal environmental legislation and strengthening of municipal environmental&#13;
councils. The project has been rated environmental category "B." Environmental aspects&#13;
of the project are treated in greater detail in Annex 5F.&#13;
7.8   Basic sanitation improvements financed by the project are expected to lead to&#13;
better public health conditions among the communities directly affected. According to&#13;
Bahia State health officials, introducing sewage collection into a low income area for the&#13;
first time can more than halve the incidence of waterborne diseases such as diarrhea and&#13;
worm infections that affect communities without basic sanitation. Children are particularly&#13;
vulnerable to these diseases which are responsible for 17. 1% of all cases of infant&#13;
mortality in Bahia. To assess public health impacts, sub-project evaluation includes an&#13;
assessment of the number of DALYs (disability-adjusted life-years) in the community&#13;
affected by the investment. Focusing upon the reduction of diarrhea and worm infections,&#13;
the project assessment uses parameters of DALY loss by diarrhea and worm infection in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
Latin America reported by the 1993 World Development Report, and estimates the cost&#13;
effectiveness of the expected impact (details: Annex 7).&#13;
D. POVERTY INEPACT&#13;
7.9   The project is expected to have an important impact on the overall situation of the&#13;
poor in the State. The preliminary indications from the draft Brazil Poverty Assessment&#13;
demonstrate that a key distinguishing feature of the poor from the non-poor is lack of&#13;
access to basic urban infrastructure. By their nature and design standards, infrastructure&#13;
investments under the project would benefit the urban poor. Furthermore, the institutional&#13;
strengthening and changes in service provision which should come about as a result of the&#13;
project is likely to have a proportional impact on the poor (below the poverty line),&#13;
estimated to be about one-third of total population in the State. The low-income&#13;
upgrading component will be a poverty-targeted program benefiting households with&#13;
incomes of less than three minimum salaries. Poverty mapping at the State level will also&#13;
be an important instrument in ensuring that investments are appropriately targeted and&#13;
have the desired impact.&#13;
E. RisKs&#13;
7.10   Since municipal reform envisioned by PRODUR has not previously been attempted&#13;
in the State of Bahia, there are risks that the zeal of municipalities to pursue tough reform&#13;
measures may wane, especially in the face of eventual political opposition. Stimulating&#13;
competition among municipalities for PRODUIR funding, rewarding those making most&#13;
progress with reforms, is a key feature of the project design aimed at mitigating this risk.&#13;
The voluntary participation in the project of new mayors that have taken office in January&#13;
1997 should ensure continuity of political commitment to the agreed reforms.&#13;
Furthermore, increasing fiscal tightness in the public sector allied to macro economic&#13;
factors, should provide incentives for municipalities to continue to pursue these reforms.&#13;
7.11  There is an additional risk that PRODUR's ID component may not be fully&#13;
implemented owing to the challenges posed by a complex intervention in many&#13;
municipalities spread across a territory as large as France's. For this reason, agreed&#13;
technical assistance and training programs and targets for municipalities to enter the&#13;
project's first-year program have already been prepared, and a team of experienced&#13;
consultants will assist CAR with implementation and train CAR staff in these functions.&#13;
Furthermore, progress on the institutional development component, where necessary, will&#13;
be linked explicitly to the infrastructure component. The risk to the ID program is also&#13;
somewhat mitigated through CAR's ready access to the experience of other states with&#13;
similar projects. There are few technical risks associated with the project, since most&#13;
infrastructure investments are of a routine nature applying well-tried solutions adopted&#13;
elsewhere.&#13;

ANNEX IA&#13;
BAHIA&#13;
MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT- PRODUR&#13;
DECENTRALIZATION AND IMPROVED MUNICIPAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
1.    The Case for Decentralization. There are several arguments in favor of federalism&#13;
or decentralization. Economists argue that because some public services have nationwide&#13;
benefits (e.g., defense and research) while others are geographically limited (eg., public&#13;
lighting), allocative efficiency calls for public services to be provided (and their costs shared)&#13;
in line with the preferences of the residents of the relevant benefit region. That is, services&#13;
with nationwide benefits should be provided for nationally, services with local benefits&#13;
should be provided for locally. Decentralization is also justified for political reasons. It is&#13;
believed that decentralization is needed in order to limit the power of one individual over&#13;
another and that it provides a training ground for democratic government. On the&#13;
institutional front, decentralization appears to facilitate the local coordination necessary in&#13;
the case of multiple local services (i.e., street paving, water and sewerage services).&#13;
2.    The Brazilian Context. Brazil's 1988 Constitution is the most recent attempt of the&#13;
country to promote decentralization and federalism. Commitment to enhance the role of&#13;
states and municipalities in the conduct of public policy is a clear characteristic of the&#13;
Constitutional text. The Constitution has increased municipal responsibilities, so that they&#13;
now cover, inter alia, urban public transport, pre-school and elementary education,&#13;
preventive health care and land-use. At the revenue level the number of municipal taxes has&#13;
doubled from two -- a tax on property and a tax on services -- to four: the urban property&#13;
tax (IPTU); the excise tax on services in a number of tertiary activities (IS S), a tax on&#13;
property sales (ITBI) and a fuel tax (IVVCLG). As a result of these changes, the share of&#13;
municipalities in total government revenues has more than doubled. However, in absolute&#13;
terms the effect has not been as large as expected, due primarily to the recessive economic&#13;
environment.&#13;
3.    Recession and fiscal adjustment have also motivated both the federal and state&#13;
governments to accelerate the implementation of the responsibilities assigned by the&#13;
Constitution to the municipalities. However, it is uncertain whether municipalities will have&#13;
the capacity to assume these new responsibilities and to manage their new resources&#13;
efficiently and equitably. In several sectors, for instance health and environment,&#13;
municipalities' experience is very limited.&#13;
4.    Findings of Economic and Sector Work. Recent Bank economic and sector work&#13;
-- in particular, the study Brazil: The Challenge of Municipal Sector Development ini the&#13;
1990s' -- has identified several issues in municipal management, one of the key areas of&#13;
_/ IBRD Report No. 10616-BR, February 1992.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
reform recommended in the report. On the expenditure side, municipalities demonstrate&#13;
insufficient investment levels and an oversized administration which has tended to consume&#13;
most of the increase in revenues through current expenditures. On the revenue side, there is&#13;
a clear lack of incentive to maximize own-revenues and to be accountable for financial&#13;
management. User fees and property taxes are not used efficiently, so negotiated transfers&#13;
continue to be major items in municipal budgets in selected cases. The need for&#13;
transparency and sustainability require that negotiated transfers be replaced by formula-&#13;
driven transfers and that extra-budgetary accounts (another non-transparent way of&#13;
receiving and spending resources) be included in the ordinary budget.&#13;
5.    The PRODUR Project and Decentralization. The proposed Bahia Municipal&#13;
Infrastructure Development and Management (PRODUR) Project fits into the above&#13;
context by explicitly addressing the major issues in municipal management identified in the&#13;
sector work. Its main objective is to assist the municipalities of the State of Bahia in&#13;
carrying out their new responsibilities as efficiently as possible. It does that in several ways:&#13;
(a)    The project provides financial incentives to local governments to enlarge&#13;
their investment capacity and to provide public services in a sustainable&#13;
fashion -- the use of full cost-recovery through tariffs and taxes is the only&#13;
way to ensure that those public services will be provided even after the life&#13;
of the project.&#13;
(b)    It strengthens local institutional capacity, with particular emphasis on&#13;
financial management and the basic sanitation and environmental&#13;
infrastructure sectors, traditionally municipal responsibilities. The&#13;
institutional content will emphasize the following activities:&#13;
(i)    providing training and technical assistance for financial&#13;
management;&#13;
(ii)   presenting simple, realistic guidelines, performance indicators and&#13;
information structures to assist proper management;&#13;
(iii)  identifying activities than can be fully privatized;&#13;
(iv)   designing appropriate incentives to keep expenditures under tight&#13;
control;&#13;
(v)    strengthening local environmental management councils and&#13;
legislation;&#13;
(vi)   ensuring the strengthening of municipal tax administration capacity&#13;
primarily through upgrading and renovating property tax cadastres&#13;
and appropriate training; and&#13;
(vii)  improving targeting in poverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
(c)   In addition, through computerization of its financial and institutional&#13;
databases, the proposed project will begin to move the State and&#13;
municipalities towards a Municipal Management Information System&#13;
(FMIS) that could help monitor macroeconomic policy, provide consistent&#13;
reporting at all levels and form an analytical base to improve&#13;
intergovernmental fiscal transfers.&#13;
(d)    Local Government Performance: Normative Criteria. Decentralization&#13;
needs to be assessed in terms of how local governments are delivering the&#13;
services for which they are responsible. The above-referenced sector&#13;
work, using basic precepts from economic literature, provides guidance in&#13;
this respect. It argues that performance of the public sector in general and&#13;
of the municipalities in particular can be assessed in terms of: (i)&#13;
accountability; (ii) production efficiency; (iii) demand efficiency; (iv)&#13;
equity; and (v) sustainability, explained in greater detail as follows:&#13;
(i)    Accountability is a direct requirement of increased responsibility.&#13;
Accountability to the electorate is required as a guarantee that the&#13;
conduct of the elected officials is in line with the voters' wishes.&#13;
Accountability to the higher levels of the government is required&#13;
when municipalities act as agents (or as spenders) of federal or state&#13;
grant funds. Reliable financial data are probably the single most&#13;
important requirement for accountability.&#13;
(ii)   Production efficiency stipulates that services provided by the&#13;
municipality should correspond to the minimum cost provision.&#13;
This can be measured directly, observing whether a municipality has&#13;
chosen the least-cost solution to provide a given service, or&#13;
indirectly by looking at how employment has evolved or how&#13;
significant is the participation of the private sector.&#13;
(iii)   Demand efficiency relates to the level at which consumer demand is&#13;
matched by provision of public services at an economic cost.&#13;
Demand efficiency is measured by the degree to which public&#13;
services are financed by cost recovery applied along the lines of the&#13;
benefit principle -- those who benefit from the good or service&#13;
should be those who pay.&#13;
(iv)   Equity goals include assessing the degree to which actions increase&#13;
or diminish interpersonal or inter-regional income disparities. It is&#13;
generally accepted that equity concerns should be pursued by&#13;
higher levels of government. Local governments trying to promote&#13;
income distribution with their own resources run into financial&#13;
problems as higher-income taxpayers tend to leave the community.&#13;
The realm of the local government should be limited to the&#13;
provision of services for which cross-subsidies are feasible -- for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
example water supply financed by high-income groups and made&#13;
available to low-income households through life-line rates.&#13;
(v)     Sustainability provides that imbalances between expenditures and&#13;
revenues be minimized, and implies that revenue authority be as&#13;
close as possible to expenditure authority.&#13;
Table I A-I indicates the areas of analysis and indicators which can be used to assess the&#13;
adequacy of municipal policymaking according to these five criteria.&#13;

ANNEX lB&#13;
BAHIA&#13;
MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT- PRODUR&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS PROJECTS&#13;
1.    In the first part of this annex, the focus is on the historical experience of nearly two&#13;
decades of Bank lending to Brazil in the urban and water supply sectors. Many of these&#13;
lessons, combined with the incentives created by the political and fiscal decentralization of&#13;
1988, contributed to the emergence of a new generation of municipal development projects&#13;
focusing on strengthening the capacity of local governments to manage and provide basic&#13;
services. Lessons learned from these more recent experiences are discussed in the second part&#13;
of this annex.&#13;
A. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE&#13;
2.    Since 1978 the Bank has made 20 loans for urban development and transport projects&#13;
in Brazil, totalling about US$2 billion. In addition, 18 loans totalling about US$2 billion have&#13;
been made for basic sanitation projects since 1971, also largely in urban areas. With this long&#13;
history of Bank involvement in the sector, many important lessons have been drawn. The&#13;
proposed project would build on lessons learned over these decades in the urban sector. The&#13;
recent OED review of urban sector lending, Twenty Years of Urban Lending. 1972-1992,&#13;
June 14, 1994 (IBRD No. 13117), cites several features of best practice, among them&#13;
demonstrated borrower ownership, emphasis on institution building, secure tenure for&#13;
beneficiaries, well-designed environmental components, and explicit poverty reduction aims.&#13;
Constraints to successful implementation are excessive focus on physical outcomes (at the&#13;
expense of institutional outcomes), poor design of environmental components, mechanisms&#13;
which favor high-standard infrastructure, and inadequate assessment of effective demand. The&#13;
report argues for a more comprehensive approach to design of urban projects which secures&#13;
project ownership, relies on institutional development and policy reform, taps potential&#13;
macroeconomic linkages, strengthens the congruence of objectives and design, and provides&#13;
for well-defined monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
3.    Consistent with these recommendations and Brazil's decentralization reforms, the&#13;
Bank's project objectives have shifted towards improving the capacity of states and&#13;
municipalities to effectively assume increased responsibilities for efficient management of&#13;
resources and services under a series of projects which focus on the strengthening of local&#13;
governmental capacity for service provision on the basis of permanent municipal development&#13;
funds at the State level. These funds are designed to provide a reliable source of financing for&#13;
urban infrastructure investment, under appropriate technical, economic and financial selection&#13;
criteria which aim at the greatest efficiency in use of funds. Investments are complemented by&#13;
technical assistance and training towards improved financial management. The first of these&#13;
projects was the Parand Market Towns Project - PRAM (2343-BR), followed by the Santa&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
Catarina Small Towns Development Project - PROURB (2623-BR -- closed December 3 1,&#13;
1993) and more recently Municipal Development Projects in the States of Parana - PEDU&#13;
(3100-BR); and in the State of Rio Grande do Sul - PIMES (3129-BR); the Minas Gerais&#13;
Municipal Management and Environmental Infrastructure Project - SOMMA (3639-BR); and&#13;
the Ceara Water Resource Management and Urban Development Project - PROURB (3789-&#13;
BR). These projects set the framework for further policy formulation for the sector, based on&#13;
the experience of the past two decades. The projects and their current status are shown in&#13;

B. RECENT EXPERIENCE&#13;
4.     Some clear lessons have emerged from the PCR of the Parana Market Towns Project -&#13;
PRAM (completed in 1990), the PCR of the Santa Catarina Small Towns Project (PROURB,&#13;
completed in 1993), and from mid-term reviews conducted more recently for other projects.&#13;
The lessons learned from such projects can be divided into three broad categories: (a) factors&#13;
of comparative success, or those which contributed to smooth and rapid achievement of&#13;
objectives and which support the sustainability of the basic project design; (b) factors of&#13;
comparative difficulty which affected projects in the past and which, however, have now been&#13;
largely resolved; and (c) factors which continue to contribute to delays, complications or&#13;
problems, and which are not yet fully resolved. The latter should be explicitly considered in&#13;
the design of subsequent operations. The first two are explained in summary form, and the&#13;
third in a matrix format which demonstrates how the specific issues have been addressed in the&#13;
design of the proposed project.&#13;
Success Factors&#13;
(a)    Demand for Resources. The forecast demand for resources has in fact&#13;
materialized, as reflected in the complete commitment of loan funds under&#13;
PRAM and PROURB (SC).&#13;
(b)    Community Response. Community/constituent response has been extremely&#13;
positive to reforming local administrations, as expressed in: willingness to pay&#13;
through tariffs and taxes for services efficiently provided; reelection of many&#13;
mayors who participated in these projects; and wide coverage in all states:&#13;
PRAM achieved coverage of about 90% of all municipalities in the State;&#13;
PEDU has reached 99%; PIMES about 50%; PROURB 99%; and SOMMA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
has active projects underway or under preparation in about 100 of the State's&#13;
nearly 800 municipalities.&#13;
(c)   Institutional Consistency. Projects are most successful when implemented&#13;
under the institutional structure of a pre-existing program. For example, a&#13;
large part of the success of the PEDU program has to do with the earlier work&#13;
done under the PRAM project. PROURB (CE) also built on existing State&#13;
programs. Many of the same systems (for disbursements, monitoring, channels&#13;
for discussions with mayors, etc.) are still in place and have simply been&#13;
upgraded. Conversely, PIMES and SOMMA have had start-up difficulties&#13;
partially due to lack of this prior experience.&#13;
(d)   Repayment of Funds. The PRAM and PROURB projects, and initial results&#13;
from the PIMES and PEDU projects have demonstrated municipal ability and&#13;
willingness to repay loan funds. The guarantees are firm and credible, and&#13;
have not been called in any of the programs.&#13;
(e)   -Increase in Municipal Own Resources. There is evidence from all four&#13;
projects that municipal financial management has improved. This is most&#13;
evident in Parana, where the second project has benefited from the existence of&#13;
the first PEDU municipal finance study.&#13;
(f)    Timing of Start-up. Both PEDU and PIMFS began near the beginning of the&#13;
mayoral term. This undoubtedly has helped in the projects' implementation.&#13;
Conversely SOMMA suffered the consequences of the shift in municipal&#13;
administrations. During the reelection cycle a lag can be expected.&#13;
5.    These factors demonstrate sustainability of the overall project concept, and justify&#13;
consideration of follow-up operations.&#13;
Past Implementation Issues&#13;
6.    Three important external factors have in the past hindered project implementation.&#13;
However (due to in part to collaboration between the GOB and the Bank), measures have&#13;
been taken to reduce or change the impact of these factors. These areas are related to:&#13;
procurement; sub-loan approvals, and disbursement.&#13;
(a)   First, procurement arrangements under all projects in Brazil have suffered the&#13;
consequences of Brazilian procurement legislation's inconsistency with the&#13;
Bank's procurement guidelines. In June 1993 a new federal procurement law&#13;
was passed, effectively eliminating most of the serious inconsistencies. This&#13;
new law, together with use of the Bank's standard bidding documents, should&#13;
effectively eliminate many procurement problems which led to significant&#13;
delays in other programs. Standard bidding documents for National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) for goods and works were agreed upon in 1995&#13;
between the Bank and the government, and are now in widespread use.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
(b)    Second, the Senate Resolution (Resolution No. 69 of 1995) setting out&#13;
guidelines for public sector indebtedness in the past stipulated that all&#13;
municipalities should be reviewed individually. Conditioned on the fact that&#13;
municipal projects adopt federal creditworthiness criteria, each State will&#13;
approve its municipal borrowing program at the same time as the State's&#13;
borrowing and the Federal Government's guarantee is approved. While not&#13;
perfect, this will reduce the executing agency's sub-project processing time,&#13;
and save staff time previously spent lobbying the Senate committee.&#13;
(c)    Third, regarding disbursements, there is no longer a Brazil-wide requirement to&#13;
hold all Special Accounts in the Central Bank in Brasilia. In the past this has&#13;
created some confusion and lag time in disbursement processes. Special&#13;
Accounts are now held in a commnercial bank mutually agreeable to the parties.&#13;
This will also minimize processing delays.&#13;

ANNEX IC&#13;
BRAZIL&#13;
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
URBAN POVERTY STRATEGY IN BRAZIL&#13;
1.    Brazil's poverty indices and other social indicators suggest that on average Brazilians&#13;
have a lower quality of life than citizens of other countries with similar levels of per capita&#13;
GDP. However, Brazil has such extreme regional disparities, and income is distributed so&#13;
unequally among the population, that national averages reveal little. The standard of living&#13;
experienced by most Northeasterners versus most Southeasterners, and within the&#13;
macroregions by low income versus high income households, is very different. Poverty tends&#13;
to be more prevalent and severe in rural areas. Nonetheless, metropolitan and other urban&#13;
areas account for a large, and growing, share of the poor.&#13;
2.     Brazil's level of public spending in the social sectors has been comparable to that of&#13;
other middle income countries. While Brazil has made clear progress since the 1970s on a&#13;
number of fronts, dramatically increasing access to electricity, water and sewage systems,&#13;
health services and schooling, and lowering the incidence of child malnutrition, improvements&#13;
in social indicators have not been commensurate with the magnitude of public social spending.&#13;
Macroeconomic instability, low economic growth and increasing income inequality have&#13;
played a role in keeping social conditions from progressing more rapidly over the past decade&#13;
and a half In addition, inefficient use of public funds has been widely recognized as part of&#13;
the problem.&#13;
3.     Poverty in the Northeast. The Northeast has the highest incidence of poverty of any&#13;
region in Brazil.' Whether one lives in a metropolitan area, a non-metropolitan urban area, or&#13;
a rural location, poverty is most prevalent in the Northeast.2 Although poverty is most&#13;
common in Brazil's rural areas and least common in its metropolitan regions, the Northeast is&#13;
so disadvantaged relative to the rest of the country that poverty is more prevalent in the&#13;
Northeast's metropolitan areas (Recife, Salvador and Fortaleza) than it is in the rural areas of&#13;
other macroregions. Over one-third of all metropolitan poor, half of the poor living in non-&#13;
metropolitan urban areas, and 70% of the rural poor live in the Northeast..&#13;
The incidence of poverty is the share of the population having per capita household incomes below the&#13;
poverty line. The analysis presented here is drawn from Brazil: A Poverty Assessment. The data&#13;
source used to conduct the poverty analysis in that report was the 1990 PNAD household survey. The&#13;
poverty line used was based on the cost of a food basket meeting recommended nutritional&#13;
requirements, adjusted for cost of living differences.&#13;
2 Metropolitan areas include the nine officially designated metropolitan regions and Brasilia. Other&#13;
urban areas encompass all areas considered urban in the PNAD, but not included in the metropolitan&#13;
regions. All county seats are categorized as urban, regardless of their population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
4.     Not only is poverty more prevalent in the Northeast, but the conditions under which&#13;
the poor live are worse there than in the rest of Brazil. Life expectancy at birth for a person in&#13;
the lowest income group (family income up to 1 minimum wage) is 15 years shorter in the&#13;
urban Northeast than in the urban Southeast. Poor Northeasterners are more likely than other&#13;
poor Brazilians to live in dwellings without internal plumbing, electricity, adequate sewerage&#13;
services, and garbage collection. This is so even when the degree of urbanization is similar.&#13;
Even non-poor residents of the Northeast have worse indicators than other Brazilians,&#13;
including at times, those with much lower incomes. Average life expectancy at birth is&#13;
actually higher for urban Southeasterners with family incomes up to I minimum wage than it&#13;
is for urban Northeasterners with family incomes between 3 and 5 minimum salaries. Like&#13;
their poor neighbors, the non-poor living in the Northeast tend to have lower access to&#13;
services and poorer housing conditions than the non-poor, and even the poor, from other&#13;
regions.&#13;
5.    The Urbanization of Poverty in Brazil. Brazil's population has become&#13;
concentrated in urban areas over the last three decades. In the 1960s and 1970s, the promise&#13;
of employment opportunities fueled the large-scale migration of rural Northeasterners to&#13;
urban areas, particularly to economically vibrant metropolises of the Southeast such as Rio de&#13;
Janeiro and Sao Paulo. In the 1 980s, economic stagnation rendered these cities less capable&#13;
of absorbing the influx of rural Northeasterners seeking to improve their welfare. However,&#13;
the lack of opportunities and extreme poverty of the rural Northeast continued to stimulate&#13;
out-migration. The populations of medium-sized cities and Northeastern metropolitan areas&#13;
has expanded as intra-state migration from rural to urban areas has accelerated.&#13;
6.    By the early 1990s, three-quarters of all Brazilians were living in urban areas. With&#13;
more of the population residing in cities and towns, the share of urban poor relative to rural&#13;
poor has grown. Over 50% of Brazil's poor are now urban. In more urbanized regions such&#13;
as the Southeast, the vast majority of the poor live in cities and towns. Even in the Northeast,&#13;
urban areas already contain around 45% of the region's poor. Assuming that the process of&#13;
urbanization continues, poverty will become an increasingly urban phenomenon in Brazil.&#13;
Strategies designed to address the specific characteristics and problems of urban poverty will&#13;
be more urgently needed.&#13;
7.    The Nature of Urban Poverty. In the Northeast, poverty rates and social indicators&#13;
tend to be worse in medium-sized and smaller urban areas while the metropolitan areas are&#13;
comparatively better-off. In the Southeast, the relative position of the large metropolitan&#13;
areas and smaller urban centers is reversed, and poverty indices tend to be higher in the&#13;
metropolitan areas.&#13;
8.    Cities have been unable to keep up with the demand for low-income housing and&#13;
utility services created by rapid urbanization. Squatter settlements, orfavelas, and other&#13;
informal communities have sprung up in nearly every city and many towns. The urban poor&#13;
are concentrated in these settlements, which are often located on the peripheries of urban&#13;
centers in flood-prone areas. Although manyfavela houses are made of brick (particularly in&#13;
more established favelas), homes are also constructed of less durable materials. Lack of&#13;
access to basic services--especially piped water from the public system, sewage and garbage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
collection--is a problem for many poor households, especially in the cities of the Northeast.&#13;
Higher-income households generally have better access to basic services.&#13;
9.    In the crowded conditions of the poorer urban communities, the lack of services&#13;
creates an unhealthy living environment. Waterborne diseases and respiratory infections tend&#13;
to be more common and more severe among the poor, and are more frequently a cause of&#13;
death among poor urban infants and toddlers than among better-off children. Similarly,&#13;
malnutrition is more prevalent among poor children. It is a particularly serious problem&#13;
among urban children in the Northeast, where over one-fifth of all children under the age of&#13;
five are physically stunted. Children in the urban Southeast are much less likely to be&#13;
malnourished. Income differences only partly explain the much higher rates of child&#13;
malnutrition in the urban Northeast. Access to basic utilities also seems to be a factor.&#13;
10.    Another characteristic of urban poverty is more limited access to quality educational&#13;
opportunities. Low-income children have much less access to pre-school and day care&#13;
facilities than the better-off. Similarly, poor urban children aged 10 to 14 are less likely than&#13;
the non-poor to attend school. On average the education that poor children receive is of&#13;
lower quality than that received by the non-poor, both because better-off children are more&#13;
likely to attend private school and because poorer states and municipalities tend to spend&#13;
much less per public school student.&#13;
11.    The relationship between poverty and child labor is complex. While children in all&#13;
income classes work, child labor is more common in the urban and metropolitan Northeast&#13;
than in the Southeast. Poor children who work (particularly those in female-headed&#13;
households) tend to work longer hours. Children working in urban areas face multiple threats&#13;
to their physical and moral well-being. The problem of"street children" is a unique feature of&#13;
urban poverty, and appears to be intimately linked with the need for poor children to&#13;
contribute to household income.&#13;
12.    Characteristics of the Urban Poor3. Roughly one-third of the urban poor live in&#13;
female-headed households. Poor households are more likely than non-poor households to be&#13;
headed by a woman, by an adult below the age of thirty, and by an illiterate. In the&#13;
Northeast, one-third to one-half of all poor household heads in urban areas are illiterate. Poor&#13;
household heads also tend to have fewer years of schooling than the non-poor Poor&#13;
3 The comparisons of the urban poor and nonpoor made in this annex hold region and residence in a&#13;
metropolitan area versus "another" urban area constant. That is, the poor in Northeastern&#13;
metropolitan areas are compared and contrasted with the nonpoor in Northeastern metropolitan areas,&#13;
the poor in non-metropolitan urban areas of the Southeast are compared to the non-poor living in the&#13;
urban Southeast, and so on. All comparisons are based on calculations made by Sonia Rocha using&#13;
the 1990 PNAD household survey data, as reported in Brazil: A Poverty Profile, a background paper&#13;
prepared for the World Bank (June 27, 1995).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
households are somewhat larger than non-poor households, and have more young children on&#13;
average.&#13;
13.   Employment patterns differ among the urban poor and non-poor. Compared to better-&#13;
off workers, the poor are more likely to be employees or self-employed, and less likely to be&#13;
employers. Poor householders are more likely than the nonpoor to work in the service sector,&#13;
agriculture, and construction, and less likely to work in manufacturinrg, trade or the civil&#13;
service. In addition, informal employment is more common among the poor. Working&#13;
without a labor card is especially prevalent among poor workers in non-metropolitan urban&#13;
areas of the Northeast. Labor force participation rates--both overall and for women&#13;
separately -- are higher in nonpoor households. The combination of more children and lower&#13;
labor force participation rates among adults of working age results in much higher dependency&#13;
ratios in poor households.4&#13;
14.   The Government's Poverty Strategy. President Cardoso has identified social justice&#13;
and poverty reduction as priorities for his administration. The Government views the battle&#13;
against poverty as a long-term task that will require continued economic development,&#13;
redistribution of income, reform of government and efficient implementation of significant&#13;
public sector programs in the areas of health and education. The Government also recognizes&#13;
the importance of implementing and managing effective social programs of immediate benefit&#13;
to low-income Brazilians.&#13;
15.   The Community Solidarity Program (PCS), a Government of Brazil initiative, aims to&#13;
mobilize all levels of Brazilian government and society to address the basic needs of the poor.&#13;
Like the earlier Fight Against Hunger program, the Programa de Comunidade Solidaria is&#13;
grounded in the principles of decentralization and community participation, and promotes&#13;
partnership between the federal government and the states, municipalities and Brazilian&#13;
society as a whole. Its main objectives include:&#13;
(a)   improving the management of selected, high priority social programs through&#13;
the promotion of community participation;&#13;
(b)    supporting the implementation of Government projects and initiatives in areas&#13;
with high concentrations of poverty; and&#13;
(c)   identifying new priorities and developing action plans for Government and civil&#13;
society.&#13;
16.   Poverty in the State of Bahia. Roughly 30% of Bahia's population have per capita&#13;
incomes below the poverty line. Infant mortality rates are high: around 96 out of every 1,000&#13;
children born in Bahia do not live to their first birthday. Sixty-three percent of the state's&#13;
children under the age of seven live in households with inadequate access to water; 58% of&#13;
the zero to six year-olds live in households where the head earns one minimum salary or less.&#13;
Service coverage is particularly low in medium and small cities and towns and rural areas.&#13;
However, even in the capital, Salvador, one-fifth of the zero to six year-olds live in&#13;
4 The dependency ratio is the number of non-working household members per working adult.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56&#13;
households not connected to the general water system. Only 5% of Bahia's population have&#13;
sewage collection. Water and sanitation system coverage in Bahia is thus low even relative to&#13;
the rest of the Northeast.&#13;
17.   Policy Implications of the Causes, Characteristics and Profile of Urban Poverty. Urban&#13;
poverty has multiple causes and dimensions. Macroeconomic instability and economic&#13;
stagnation are the environment in which urban poverty thrives best. Inadequate access to&#13;
productive employment and other income generating opportunities, lower quality and quantity&#13;
of schooling, and limited availability of basic sanitation and other urban infrastructure are both&#13;
causes and consequences of urban poverty. The linkages among these factors are&#13;
considerable.&#13;
18.   Poor households are more likely than better-off households to lack access to clean&#13;
water, sewage systems and garbage collection. Lack of basic sanitation exacerbates&#13;
malnutrition, by subjecting young children to diarrheal diseases that hinder their body's ability&#13;
to convert food into energy and good health. This can lead to stunting and other chronic&#13;
conditions which have negative implications for future productivity. In the short run, by&#13;
making childhood illnesses more likely, lack of access to basic sanitation can hamper a&#13;
fiamily's ability to generate income by diverting parents from work in order to care for sick&#13;
children.&#13;
19.   Poor children are much less likely than better-off children to graduate from primary&#13;
school (let alone secondary school). This perpetuates the cycle of poverty through the link&#13;
between wages in adulthood and educational attainment, and contributes to the inter-&#13;
generational transfer of poverty. The importance of enhancing the quality of public schools&#13;
attended by poor children for urban poverty reduction can hardly be over-emphasized.&#13;
20.   When a household's adults lack access to employment that generates sufficient income&#13;
to support the family, children are often required to prematurely take on income-earning&#13;
responsibilities. This exposes children to many risks, hinders schooling and rarely leads to job&#13;
opportunities that will allow them to break the cycle of poverty in adulthood.&#13;
21.   These are just a few examples of the linkages among urban poverty, education, basic&#13;
urban infrastructure, and employment. The policy implications of these linkages are that&#13;
synergies exist and policy interventions on several fronts can multiply their impact.&#13;
22.   Another clear implication of the profile of urban poverty is that urban areas in the&#13;
Northeast ghould receive priority in the allocation of resources and implementation of&#13;
programs to address urban poverty. However, effective policy interventions require effective&#13;
public institutions. The share of public resources controlled by municipalities has grown&#13;
rapidly since 1988, increasing the importance of skilled public management at the local level.&#13;
The Northeast lacks a strong cadre of local public administrators. With some exceptions, the&#13;
provision of social services in the Northeast has traditionally been characterized by uneven&#13;
administration, inefficient use of resources and paternalism. To overcome these tendencies,&#13;
investments must be made in the training of middle- and senior-level urban administrators in&#13;
relevant skills, in the adoption of rational planning methodologies, and in the regular&#13;
reinforcement and upgrading of these skills.&#13;

BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND&#13;
MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
STATE OF BAHIA CREDITWORTHINESS ASSESSMENT&#13;
1.    A creditworthiness assessment of the state of Bahia is carried out here using the&#13;
guidelines developed in Assessing State Creditworthiness in Brazil. No.8. Economic&#13;
Notes. Country Department 1. LAC, 1996.&#13;
Backsround&#13;
2.    Over the 1993-95 period, the Government of Bahia's budgetary accounts&#13;
registered primary surpluses every year with an average primary surplus of R$130 million&#13;
(constant prices of January 1996). The state suffered a large overall deficit in only one&#13;
year 1994, but the average overall deficit for the period was only R$40 mnillion, or only 1.5&#13;
percent of average net revenues over the period (net of municipal transfers).&#13;
Financial Projections&#13;
3.    Table 3G-1 below presents financial projections for the state for the period 1995-&#13;
2000. The data for 1995 are actuals, with some minor estimated items.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
71&#13;
4.    The item " Residuo Divida" refers to the excess of accrued debt service and&#13;
amortization on certain categories of debt. There is a limit of 11% of net revenues on this&#13;
debt service. This limit has been negotiated between the states and the Federal Senate&#13;
according to Senate Resolution No. 69 in order to avoid undue pressure on essential&#13;
categories of expenditure. The excess is capitalized into the existing debt stock and repaid&#13;
beyond the horizon presented here, when debt service and amortization would fall below&#13;
this limit.&#13;
5.    Assumptions. The assumptions underlying the projections are conservative. They&#13;
are: (1) Revenue growth. It is assumed that revenue grows at a rate of 3.5 % in 1995,&#13;
4.5% in 1996 and 5 % per annum thereafter. These rates are close to the projected growth&#13;
of the state economy and also represent a modest degree of additional tax effort. (2)&#13;
Personnel expenditures. It is assumed that personnel expenditure growth is 0 % in 1996&#13;
because of an adjustment effort on the part of the state with no increase in nominal wages&#13;
granted this year. There is positive growth at a rate of 4.5 % thereafter. (3) Debt service.&#13;
Debt service is projected according to actual contracts, except for debt in the form of&#13;
bonds. It is assumed that bonds are amortized over 50 years. The state, however, services&#13;
the interest and there is no debt forgiveness. (4) New Borrowing: No new borrowing is&#13;
allowed. (5) Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures are held constant at the 1995&#13;
level. However, because budgetary surpluses are generated, there is a margin for&#13;
increasing capital expenditure.&#13;
6.    Results. A number of accounting concepts are monitored and presented in Table&#13;
3G-2 below. The CurrentAccountBalance. This indicator is monitored to see if the state&#13;
government is generating public savings to finance part or all of its annual investment&#13;
program. Primary Balance (overall deficit excluding interest payments). This indicator&#13;
is monitored to see if the primary surplus will be adequate for meeting future interest&#13;
payments, and perhaps some portion of amortization's. Overall Balance. This is&#13;
monitored to see if it is at least shrinking as a share of revenues. The Ratio of the Stock of&#13;
Debt to Net Revenue. This indicator should be declining over time. We see in the table&#13;
below that the current and primary balances are in surplus and growing over the projection&#13;
period. The overall balance is positive and large enough to result in a rapidly declining&#13;
debt-to-revenue ratio over the projected period.&#13;

Oualitative Management Issues&#13;
7.    The state has been consistently fiscally conservative in recent years. Bahia is one&#13;
of the few in Brazil to already be in near compliance with the Lei Camata target of limiting&#13;
personnel expenditures to 60% of net current revenues. In addition, the state passed a law&#13;
earlier this year which authorizes a special "voluntary dismissal" program to further&#13;
control expenditures in this area. A sign of the administration's forward-looking approach&#13;
is a plan, currently being designed, to use privatization revenues and property sales to&#13;
create a fund for financing an anticipated future increase in the pension payroll.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
8.    Based on the above criteria, Bahia can be considered creditworthy. The state has a&#13;
current account surplus. The margin of the surplus is above 10%, even with "Residuo&#13;
Divida" being considered part of expenditure. The primary surplus is growing. There is&#13;
an overall deficit in the base year of the projections, but a surplus in the remaining years&#13;
that is growing. The stock of debt to revenue ratio remains very high; however, the debt&#13;
service to expenditure ratio is below 10 percent because the bulk of Bahia' s debt is long&#13;
term contractual debt with Federal financial institutions on favorable terms or, with&#13;
multilateral external creditors. The projections assume that all short term arrears are paid&#13;
off by the end of 1998--the end of the term of the present government. The projections&#13;
are not unusually sensitive to parameters such as the wage level or interest rates, and the&#13;
wage to revenue ratio is close to the " Lei Camata" guideline of 60% of net current&#13;
revenues.&#13;

ANNEX 4A&#13;
BRAZIL&#13;
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
1.    Outlined below is a detailed description of the project components: Municipal&#13;
Reform (Part A); Institutional Development, including a Poverty Mapping Study (Part B),&#13;
Urban Infrastructure (Part C); and Poverty-Targeted Urban Upgrading (Part D).&#13;
Operational arrangements which set out selection criteria and link the technical assistance&#13;
and infrastructure sub-projects are described in Annex 5E.&#13;
A. Municipal Reform (MR) Component&#13;
(US$ 10.0 million, 4.5% of project costs)&#13;
2.    The primary objective of the Municipal Reform component of the project is to&#13;
increase the efficiency and sustainability of the delivery of infrastructure and social&#13;
services in Bahia's municipalities..&#13;
3.    This is to be accomplished through encouraging the municipalities to enter into&#13;
partnership with the private sector to provide municipal services wherever this can be&#13;
more efficiently done. In this manner the role of the municipal public sector would be&#13;
reduced to those critical administrative, social, and other operational functions that cannot&#13;
be provided efficiently by others.&#13;
4.    Together with CAR, the municipalities seeking to participate in PORDUR would&#13;
undertake an analysis of the range of services provided by the municipality. Services&#13;
currently being provided which could be privatized and/or farmed out to private&#13;
concessions would be identified. Consultants would be engaged to assist CAR and the&#13;
municipalities in this exercise as necessary. An implementation plan would be drawn up.&#13;
5.    Funds from the loan would be made available, on a grant basis, to finance the costs&#13;
of consultants in the diagnosis as well as the implementation of the privatization or&#13;
concession program. In addition the funds could finance the incremental cost of the&#13;
transfer on a declining basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74&#13;
B. Institutional Development (I1D) Component&#13;
(US$10.0 million, 4.5% of project costs)&#13;
(a) Objective&#13;
6.    Should the initial diagnosis judge them to be necessary the MR component the ID&#13;
component will provide entry into the program. The specific objectives of the ID for the&#13;
municipalities are to:&#13;
(i)   improve local government financial management, particularly&#13;
increasing own as a portion of total revenues and efficiency in&#13;
current expenditures;&#13;
(ii)   reinforce municipal capacity to plan. prioritize, select and&#13;
implement efficient infrastructure investments on the basis of&#13;
appropriate selection criteria; and&#13;
(iii)  strengthen municipal government professional staff in the above&#13;
areas through training&#13;
(b) Implementation&#13;
7.    Eligibility criteria will ensure that all municipalities entering the program develop&#13;
an acceptable institutional and financial development plan. The institutional development&#13;
plan will be consolidated with the municipal reform program to the negotiating agreement&#13;
(accordo de negocia,ao)&#13;
8.    Once a program of institutional development actions is agreed, including both&#13;
training and technical assistance, the municipality will determine sources of assistance on&#13;
the basis of a short list. For training, municipalities will choose among independent&#13;
consultants. It is planned that most technical assistance interventions will be executed by&#13;
independent consultants according to standards and guidelines prepared by CAR and&#13;
agreed with the CAR and the Bank. For technical assistance, municipalities will choose on&#13;
the basis of terms of reference and short lists as stipulated under the Program's guidelines&#13;
and consistent with Bank procurement guidelines (see Chapter 5).&#13;
9.    Sample terms of reference for standard technical assistance irvestments, such as&#13;
upgrading of property cadastres, will be agreed with the Bank for tllis purpose. CAR will&#13;
also maintain a database of consulting firms interested in providing technical assistance to&#13;
municipalities in these areas, to be advertised annually. This list will in no way be&#13;
restrictive, and will be available to municipalities simply as a resource.&#13;
10.   Because of its fundamental goal of increasing local government own-resource&#13;
mobilization and improved efficiency in both current and capital expenditures, the&#13;
institutional development component is directly linked to progress on infrastructure&#13;
investments. This linkage will be established in each municipality through the PRIM and&#13;
sub-loan contracts, and closely monitored through agreed indicators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
75&#13;
(c) Technical Assistance Investments (US$4. 1 million)&#13;
(i)    The technical assistance sub-component would focus on&#13;
interventions in two main areas:&#13;
(ii)   fiscal and administrative: upgrading property tax cadastres&#13;
(including reevaluating existing property, inclusion of un-registered&#13;
property); improving procedures, policies and physical&#13;
infrastructure for billing and collection of property and other taxes&#13;
and tariffs; improving procurement procedures; and&#13;
(iii)   planning: preparing and updating of master plans; updating real&#13;
property mapping; works and construction codes and technical&#13;
standards.&#13;
11.   Technical assistance costs have been estimated on the basis of current market costs of&#13;
similar technical assistance interventions in Bahia and other states, estimated by CAR.&#13;
Technical assistance investments averaging about US$50,000 per municipality for about 220&#13;
municipalities have been budgeted.&#13;
(d) Training Investments (US$3.6 million)&#13;
12.   The training program is designed to complement the technical assistance component&#13;
and would be largely oriented towards on-the-job training, rather than classroom lectures. It&#13;
would include, inter alia, the following areas: municipal accounting and budgeting,&#13;
procurement methods, land-use planning and usage of master plans, environmental protection&#13;
and enforcement instruments, financial and administrative management; project evaluation.&#13;
13.   Local training unit costs (costs per participant per day) would be estimated on the&#13;
basis of on-going programs implemented by other Brazilian agencies, averaged from&#13;
aggregate costs per event per day. Costs include rental of training facilities, trainers' fees and&#13;
honoraria, and travel and subsistence costs for both trainers and participants. It is estimated&#13;
that about 1200-1500 municipal staff will be trained under the project.&#13;
(e) Equipment (US$1.2 million)&#13;
14.   PRODLJR will also finance limited and well-justified office equipment purchases,&#13;
largely computers, printers, and other office technology upgrades which will improve the&#13;
efficiency of processes and information flow in municipalities.&#13;
(f) State Technical Assistance and Studies (US$ 1. 1 million)&#13;
15    Technical assistance for the CAR would also be provided under this component. The&#13;
project would finance training and technical assistance to prepare CAR to discharge the role&#13;
of executing agency. This would include hiring of an internationally-recognized urban&#13;
advisor. Under this component would also be included the Statewide poverty mapping study,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
76&#13;
details of which would be discussed during appraisal and agreed during Negotiations (terms of&#13;
reference would also be included as Annex 4C).&#13;
C. Infrastructure Component&#13;
(US$186.5 million, 84% of project costs)&#13;
(a) Focus and Dimensioning of PRODUR&#13;
16.   Upon taking office in 1995, the new State government identified the basic&#13;
sanitation sectors, including water, sewerage, drainage and solid waste as among its key&#13;
priorities. As is set out in its Policy Statement on Urban Development, the State's&#13;
intention is that the PRODUJR program will be one of its primary vehicle for such&#13;
investments in the State.&#13;
17.   In order to dimension investments for the PRODUR program, the State and CAR&#13;
evaluated several key areas: demand for resources; municipal and State capacity to borrow&#13;
and repay loan funds; and State and municipal technical, institutional and financial&#13;
absorptive capacity. First, as part of project preparation, in 1994, CAR undertook a&#13;
survey of 66 of the State's larger cities, representing about 924,000 inhabitants, or about&#13;
8% of the population. The study confirmed that the most widely demanded investments&#13;
were water supply, sewerage collection and treatment, solid waste collection and disposal,&#13;
street paving and drainage. Second, CAR prepared an evaluation of the credit limits of a&#13;
sample of 36 of the State's municipalities, which indicate an annual State-wide debt limit&#13;
of on the order of US$200 million. Finally, the State Government demonstrated in its&#13;
historic financial statements that for the past several years it has been spending on the&#13;
order of US$630 million on annual capital investments, largely in urban infrastructure. It&#13;
is the equivalent of these funds which would go into the FUNDURBANO as State&#13;
counterpart. The proposed project scope of about US$220 million for infrastructure and&#13;
institutional development investments over a six-year period (or about US$37 million per&#13;
year) was based on these findings. With State counterpart of about US$72 million (about&#13;
US$15 million per year) and about US$33 million from municipalities (about US$5.5&#13;
million per year) to be provided each year, the project is conservatively dimensioned.&#13;
Simulations indicate that about 77 of the State's municipalities will participate in the&#13;
project. While municipalities which have access to loan funds under the Bank-supported&#13;
NRPA program would not be eligible, municipal eligibility for sub-loans would depend on&#13;
fulfillment of the criteria for selection, eg., acceptable debt capacity and adequate financial&#13;
and institutional capacity.&#13;
(b) First-Year Program&#13;
18.   The proposed Bank loan will finance, together with State and municipal&#13;
counterpart resources, a time slice of municipal investments. The investment programs of&#13;
subsequent years are likely to mirror that of the first year, although the exact mix of sub-&#13;
projects cannot be determined in advance and will be subject to change depending on the&#13;
priorities of the sub-borrowers. Thus the physical targets, established on the basis of the&#13;
first year program, should be seen as indicative only and will be reviewed throughout&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77&#13;
(c) Terms and Conditions&#13;
19.   The infrastructure component would be subject to the following guidelines: No&#13;
municipality will receive more than 10% of total funds lent in any given year, without prior&#13;
Bank agreement. This arrangement would be reviewed at the project's mid-term. All&#13;
infrastructure sub-projects will be bid and executed by the sub-borrowers. All investments&#13;
expected to cost more than US$5 million would require the prior review of the Bank.&#13;
20.   As explained elsewhere, infrastructure investments would be financed through sub-&#13;
loans for up to 85% of the sub-project costs from the PRODUR Fund and the remaining 15%&#13;
(minimum) provided by the municipality as counterpart, in the form of payment of receipts for&#13;
expenditures. The form of counterpart contribution would be agreed prior to contracting the&#13;
loan, and stipulated in the sub-loan contract between the financial agent, CAR and the&#13;
municipality. Each sub-loan would have a grace period and maturity corresponding with the&#13;
sub-project's implementation and pay-back periods, respectively.&#13;
21.   Municipal governments and local water companies would bid and implement&#13;
investments in various water and sewerage investments. Low-cost and alternative&#13;
technologies for sewerage treatment would be prioritized. Sewerage treatment investments&#13;
would be eligible when, in addition to other selection criteria, technical analysis demonstrates&#13;
their benefits to be primarily "on-site," or within the municipality. Those "off-site"&#13;
investments, for which benefits may be more broadly spread to other surrounding&#13;
municipalities in a water-basin area require formation of a water basin consortium and a&#13;
detailed feasibility study, for which grant financing would be available.&#13;
(d) Water and Sewerage Investments (US$75.5 million)&#13;
22.   Eligible investments under this component would be: (i) water distribution connections&#13;
and limited production and treatment; (ii) sewage collection and limited, primarily low-cost&#13;
technology, treatment; and (iii) operational improvements such as metering. Water and&#13;
sewerage components will be executed by municipalities in cases where they operate the&#13;
systems, or by municipal companies, in cases where they operate municipal systems.&#13;
Sewerage treatment investments over US$2 million would be subject to Bank prior review.&#13;
(e)   Drainage, Paving and Erosion Control Investments (US$75.6 million)&#13;
23.   Micro- and macro-drainage and erosion/flood control investments would include&#13;
construction and in some cases rehabilitation of drainage networks. Because lands subject to&#13;
flooding are generally less valuable, these at-risk areas are often the sites of informal low-&#13;
income settlements. Diagnosis of at-risk areas is part of the technical assistance component in&#13;
affected municipalities and would be identified in the institutional evaluation process. Paving&#13;
investments would include local roads, minor rehabilitation repairs and related retaining walls&#13;
and drainage. Most municipalities expected to participate in the program have public works&#13;
departments which are capable of designing and supervising these relatively simple works. If&#13;
during project implementation the Bank and CAR determine that this is not the case, the State&#13;
Roads Department (Departamento de Estradas e Rodagem -DER), or other qualified&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78&#13;
consultants, could be contracted to operate as a technical agent for works administration and&#13;
supervision.&#13;
(f) Solid Waste Investments (US$8.9 million)&#13;
24.   This component would consist of construction of sanitary landfills, limited alternative&#13;
disposal technologies such as recycling and composting plants, and purchase of solid waste&#13;
collection and disposal equipment. The component would also include construction of&#13;
designated hazardous waste disposal sites. Technical assistance for evaluation and supervision&#13;
of sub-projects would be provided by university and local specialized consultants. Solid waste&#13;
disposal investments over US$2 million would be subject to Bank prior review.&#13;
(g) Complementary Investments (US$15.5 million)&#13;
25.   It is expected that other, smaller investments related to the above larger investments&#13;
would also be undertaken, such as street-lighting, sidewalks, traffic management, and planting&#13;
of trees.&#13;
(h) Regional Investments (US$11.1 million)&#13;
26.   Regional cooperative investments in large shared infrastructure among several&#13;
municipalities, such as landfills. These sub-projects, along with the participating sub-&#13;
borrowers, must meet all of the eligibility criteria established in the project. Other project&#13;
component include the construction of municipal markets and slaughterhouses and the&#13;
construction and/or expansion of air, road and water transport passenger shelters and tourist&#13;
bureaus.&#13;
D. Urban Uparadini&#13;
(US$15.5 million, 7% of costs)&#13;
27.   The urban upgrading component would be targeted to areas with average&#13;
household income below two minimum wages per month. The objective of the&#13;
component would be to provide a package of integrated urban infrastructure investments&#13;
to low-income residents in the peripheral areas of cities and towns, where the bulk of the&#13;
urban poor are located. The component would be based on standardized designs and unit&#13;
costs and would be managed by a special unit within CAR. Eligibility criteria would&#13;
include that: (a) beneficiary areas must be within a maximum threshold income level (for&#13;
example, three minimum salaries per month per household); (b) the investments would be&#13;
limited by a maximum project cost per capita; (b) investments should be integrated; (c)&#13;
community participation and organization would need to be demonstrated; (d) residents&#13;
would need to have possession of land title, or the area would be able to be converted, or&#13;
residents would need to have lived in the area for equal to or more than the amount of&#13;
time stipulated by law before titling becomes automatic. Since this was a new approach to&#13;
infrastructure service delivery in the State, the overall scope should be limited to US$15.5&#13;
million, and it should start small in the first year (limited to US$2 million). Publicity for&#13;
the program should include reference to the limited funds available under this component&#13;
for the first year, in order to stimulate demand.&#13;

ANNEX 4C&#13;
BAHIA M UNICIPAL NIFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Outline - Terms of Reference&#13;
MAPPING OF POVERTY&#13;
(Translation of the Terms of Reference (TORs) agreed at Negotiations)&#13;
Justification:&#13;
1.    Brazil's efforts to modernize and develop its economy has been comprehensive.&#13;
While Brazil is building one of the largest economies in the modern world, its statistics on&#13;
the quality of life are alarming. Brazil's complex society requires the implementation of&#13;
more efficient policies to overcome its basic problems.&#13;
2.    The concern with analyzing poverty conditions, particularly urban poverty, is&#13;
worldwide. Efforts in the area have accelerated since the 1970s with emphasis being put&#13;
on the dynamics between urban development and economic development. The research&#13;
done, so far, shows that the traditional indicators of economic development, such as&#13;
GNP, do not capture the full extent of relative or absolute poverty and the miserable&#13;
conditions under which those social groups living below the poverty line are subjected.&#13;
3.    Poverty indicators used worldwide began to be based more heavily on vital&#13;
statistics, such as the Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI), which essentially considers&#13;
indicators such as birthrates, infant mortality rates, longevity and education. National&#13;
level poverty indicators also use variables such as the percentage of the population with&#13;
access to health services, housing, education, income level, access to formal employment,&#13;
access to appliances such as stoves, radios and televisions, and access to water, sewage&#13;
and electricity services.&#13;
4.    The results of such analyses offer a "quality" input for regional urban planning;&#13;
moreover, the existence of such studies at the State level can lead to the development of&#13;
various policies, especially compensatory policies, which represent an important new role&#13;
of the State.&#13;
5.    With the support of international institutions, the Federal Government has&#13;
undertaken several studies that use variables recognized worldwide to measure the quality&#13;
of life of the population. The result has been some conclusions about topics such as&#13;
survival rates for children ages 0-6 years, a hunger map, and human development&#13;
indicators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81&#13;
6.    These results facilitated interstate and inter-municipal comparisons on the basis of&#13;
which a system evolved that explicitly ranks the different States. This, in turn, led to the&#13;
establishment of a corresponding national data base on poverty and quality of life. While&#13;
the above studies used distinct points of reference, invariably the primary data gathered&#13;
were the same; that is, infant mortality rate, mortality rate, life expectancy, percentage of&#13;
the population served by sewage services, level of education, etc. By comparing the&#13;
results of the different studies, there was little difference found in the ranking of the&#13;
municipalities. Hence, the classification of municipalities is consolidated in terms of&#13;
poverty level and quality of life.&#13;
7.    The global results found for municipalities are easily transposed to the urban area,&#13;
as there is little difference in the averages for socio-economic status, with the exception of&#13;
medium and large cities. The latter show an imbalance between supply and demand for&#13;
urban services due to large migration flows, and normally involve a socially destructive&#13;
process characterized by deterioration of the urban environment in the form of slums,&#13;
problems with criminality, a reduction in the provision of health services, education,&#13;
sewage, etc.--all of which make the quality of life very difficult, especially for the poor.&#13;
8.     The number of medium and large cities is relatively small in the State of Bahia. The&#13;
classification of municipalities by their urban poverty level is available through the above-&#13;
mentioned studies. If adjustments need to be made due to special circumstances, a review&#13;
of such studies would be made to gather the needed supplementary information.&#13;
9.    While extensive studies make it possible to elaborate on interurban ranking, a&#13;
study locating and researching inter-urban poverty in each city is needed to prioritize&#13;
Government actions affecting the poor.&#13;
Objective:&#13;
10.   The objective is to provide to the State the urban planning tools capable of&#13;
measuring the level of poverty in each municipality; to create the possibility of making&#13;
comparisons between inter- and intra-urban areas; and to make it viable to develop social&#13;
policies based on social equity.&#13;
11.   To achieve this goal the participation of the municipalities from the planning stage&#13;
through the final phase is a priority to obtain results to address the State's actual&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
Scope and Methodology - The Inter-Urban Poverty Map:&#13;
12.   This study would select variables and parameters that facilitate the measurement of&#13;
poverty levels and consequently the quality of life in each municipal center, and which&#13;
make it possible to identify the intra-urban areas and to classify them by level of need.&#13;
13.   To design this "zoning," a very simple methodology is planned that requires the&#13;
participation of the municipalities for the input and design of the map.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82&#13;
14.   Utilizing maps of the designated city, three or four representatives from each&#13;
municipality-- municipal government, board of representatives, and social personalities&#13;
chosen according to the local situation--would map the urban location using their&#13;
knowledge and experience, and, taking into consideration the quality of life of their&#13;
respective populations, would demarcate the different zoning borders.&#13;
15.   To verify this initial mapping, the study would consider the following aspects in&#13;
each zone: total number of houses; resident population; percentage of households served&#13;
by water, electricity, and sewage; urban maintenance; population served by health services&#13;
and public education; total number of registered illnesses; family income levels;&#13;
predominant types of jobs; household patterns; and other information that would be&#13;
relevant for classifying the areas according to their poverty level.&#13;
16.   The above-mentioned data are generally available to the municipalities in aggregate&#13;
terms. Moreover, the municipal governments have tools that allow the required&#13;
information to be provided more precisely. In some cases, it will be necessary to estimate&#13;
the data or to gather it in the field.&#13;
17.   CAR will participate in the work of compiling the data, with the result being the&#13;
design of a map showing the final zoning from the indicators and parameters used in the&#13;
study.&#13;
Final Product:&#13;
18.   The study will present as its final product:&#13;
a)    Mapping of regional areas of the urban space to facilitate planning policies&#13;
and subsequent actions;&#13;
b)    Technology to implement a data base of municipal information.&#13;
Consultants Profile:&#13;
19.   As the study is multi sectoral it will require a team of professionals with varied&#13;
specialties. Ideally, the firm to be chosen would have the following competencies:&#13;
experience in developing similar studies; and the individuals to participate&#13;
in the study must themselves have experience in similar studies.&#13;
successful implementation of similar studies.&#13;
Deadline:&#13;
20.   90 to 120 days from the date of the signed contract.&#13;

ANNEX 4D&#13;
BRAZIL&#13;
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
OUTLINE-DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR URBAN DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANCY&#13;
Justification:&#13;
1.    The State Development and Regional Action Company (CAR) plans to embark on&#13;
an ambitious program of urban development that is designed to assist in strengthening&#13;
urban infrastructure and services in the State's cities so as to provide better living&#13;
conditions for their inhabitants, especially low-income people and the poorest segment of&#13;
the urban populations.&#13;
2.    In order to carry out this role, CAR needs to develop a strategy and prepare for&#13;
the implementation of the Bahia Municipal Infrastructure Development and Management&#13;
Project. This strategy would involve a clear vision of the kinds of projects to be financed&#13;
and how best to implement them. To work successfully in poor urban areas, CAR will&#13;
need to develop techniques or community outreach to tap existing community resources&#13;
and to create new leadership structures where these are inadequate. The strategy will&#13;
involve three main activities: (1) development of a comprehensive strategy; (2)&#13;
development of an appropriate structure and operational procedures; (3) recruitment and&#13;
training of staff.&#13;
Objectives:&#13;
(a)   Conduct a strategic planning exercise that identifies the primary mission of&#13;
CAR in urban development and sets priorities for actions, and a timetable&#13;
for implementation;&#13;
(b)   Identify CAR's information needs, the best sources of such information and&#13;
the best ways to collect, store and retrieve data necessary for the&#13;
management of the project. This would include data and analyses of&#13;
population, migration, morbidity and mortality, income, living levels, urban&#13;
services available.&#13;
(c)   Modify the structure of CAR so as to carry out the major functions&#13;
foreseen. These include planning and budgeting, project evaluation,&#13;
community outreach, institutional relations (including contracts), staff and&#13;
beneficiary training, financial operations, procurement advising, project&#13;
monitoring, evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
84&#13;
(d)   Develop appropriate training procedures for CAR staff, prepare specific&#13;
training activities, including in-service training, and training of municipal&#13;
staff in community mobilization.&#13;
(e)    To achieve these objectives, CAR will hire an experienced consultant or&#13;
group of consultants that will assist CAR in achieving these goals.&#13;
Methodoloty:&#13;
3.    The consultant will first prepare a detailed timetable of activities in consultation&#13;
with CAR's management. Once agreed, the first strategic planning activity will be planned&#13;
and held. Following this activity, the consultant will assist CAR management in&#13;
implementing the necessary changes in CAR's structure and procedures. At this time.&#13;

ANNEX 4E&#13;
BRAZIL&#13;
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
CAR: THE EXECUTING AGENCY&#13;
1. The State's Companhia de Desenvolvimento e Aqao Regional (CAR) would be the project's&#13;
executing agency. CAR would have primary responsibility for all aspects of project implementation,&#13;
including evaluation of sub-borrowers' financial and institutional capacity, diagnosis of institutional&#13;
requirements and formulation of technical assistance and training packages, evaluation of technical,&#13;
economic and financial feasibility of sub-projects, and all general aspects of management, operation&#13;
and monitoring of the project. These procedures would all be undertaken on the basis of an agreed&#13;
Operational Manuals.&#13;
2. CAR was created by State Law in 1983 as a public "autarky," and later transformed into a public&#13;
company in order to provide more flexibility in implementation of its responsibilities. CAR's shares&#13;
are wholly owned by the State. CAR's Executive Director is appointed by the Governor. The&#13;
Secretary of Planning serves as Chairman of the its Board of Directors. CAR is headquartered in the&#13;
State's capital, Salvador, and has regional offices in seven medium-sized cities around the State. CAR&#13;
has historically acted primarily in the rural sector, and in this capacity has significant experience&#13;
implementing decentralized programs, including the World Bank-financed Northeast Rural&#13;
Development Program The implementation of the NRDP in Bahia was in fact one of the most&#13;
successful of these state-based programs. As of 1991, CAR has also been given responsibility for&#13;
execution of the State's programs in urban areas. This is a significant challenge for CAR, which has&#13;
an excellent history and experience in the rural sectors but which has relatively little experience in&#13;
urban areas. A further challenge stems from CAR's recent (1995) assumption of the responsibilities&#13;
of technical assistance to municipalities, a role previously performed by a now-defunct State&#13;
company, CEMUR.&#13;
3. Detailed discussions have been held with the State and CAR regarding the institutional capacity of&#13;
the latter, and plans for strengthening capabilities in the urban area. Plans include restructuring CAR&#13;
into three Departments: (a) Regional Development (for rural-oriented programs); (b) Urban&#13;
Development; and (c) Municipal Action (for support to institutional strengthening of local&#13;
governments). While the management and infrastructure aspects of PRODUR would fall under the&#13;
Urban Development Department, the Municipal Action Department would handle the institutional&#13;
development component. The ongoing NRDP and its successor, the Northeast Rural Poverty&#13;
Alleviation Program (NRPA) now under preparation, would be handled by CAR's Regional&#13;
Development division. CAR also has plans to establish about twelve additional regional offices, in the&#13;
context of the PRODUR and NRPA projects.&#13;
4. Regarding specific project tasks, CAR has established a financial nucleus in the Urban&#13;
Development division, which has been trained in public financial analysis. It was also agreed that in&#13;
light of CAR's previous rural focus, that both the Urban Development Department, and the project&#13;
itself, would benefit from an urban planning and development specialist adviser who could be hired on&#13;
a part-time contractual basis as part of the program in order to advise CAR on its role in the&#13;
development and implementation of State urban development policy, establishment of an urban&#13;
development department within CAR, and help to establish priorities and guide the department in&#13;
project execution questions.&#13;

ANNEX 5E&#13;
BRAZIL&#13;
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
CAR's APPRAISAL PROCESS&#13;
1.    PRODUR is open to all municipalities in the State of Bahia, providing the&#13;
municipality adheres to its objectives and meets the basic eligibility criteria for the&#13;
program. Steps on the critical path to entry in the Program are presented in detail in the&#13;
Program's Operational Manual (OM), and explained below.&#13;
(a)   The first step for entry into the program is the signature of a Participation&#13;
Agreement between the municipality and the State, indicating municipal&#13;
interest in and adherence to Program objectives.&#13;
(b)   The second step is completion of a diagnostic form the objective of which&#13;
is to gather data related to municipal financial, fiscal, planning,&#13;
environmental management and infrastructure service provision.&#13;
Depending on municipal capability and preference, this form is completed&#13;
prepared by the municipality alone or in conjunction with technical&#13;
assistance from private consultants. This diagnostic tool was refined&#13;
during appraisal. It is available in the Project File.&#13;
(c)   The third step, on the basis of this diagnosis, the municipality agrees with&#13;
CAR on a program of priority institutional investments (comprised of&#13;
technical assistance and training) for a medium-term period.&#13;
(d)   Fourth, the municipality must demonstrate compliance with Federal&#13;
legislation regarding payment of intergovernmental taxes and other&#13;
obligations.&#13;
2.    On the basis of this analysis, a set of standard performance targets are agreed with&#13;
the municipality for improved financial and institutional management and formalized the&#13;
accordo de negocia,ao. Completion of these steps enables municipalities to begin training&#13;
investments.&#13;
3.    CAR will play the role of Executive Secretariat (Secretario Executivo, or SE) of&#13;
the Program's Board of Directors (Conselho Diretor). In this role, CAR will assist in&#13;
filling out the Institutional and Financial Diagnosis Forms, and advice and technical&#13;
assistance to ensure that all applications are complete and data is presented correctly and&#13;
in a timely way. The assistance of the CAR will be critical in this phase of analysis, as&#13;
many other programs have suffered significant set-backs in implementation as a result of&#13;
poorly completed applications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
92&#13;
4.    To be eligible for infrastructure investments, municipalities will have to&#13;
demonstrate creditworthiness, provide a feasibility study (as a minimum) of the proposed&#13;
investment, and demonstrate that the investment is: (a) the least cost technical solution&#13;
(details of the analysis are shown below); (b) a high-priority investment (compared with&#13;
other infrastructure investments) by evaluation of its economic benefits; and (c) that it is&#13;
demonstrates cost recovery. Furthermore, in addition to the standard performance targets&#13;
to be agreed in the accordo de negociagao, specific cost-recovery targets will be agreed&#13;
for infrastructure investments with financing under the Program. As mentioned, the&#13;
institutional diagnosis, project feasibility studies (for successfully evaluated projects) and&#13;
detailed designs will be eligible as municipal counterpart.&#13;
5.    The Urban Department (DU) within CAR will prepare all sub-project appraisals,&#13;
with the assistance of technical agents as needed, and according to agreed criteria set out&#13;
in operational manuals. DU staff will undertake three main areas of analysis: (a)&#13;
creditworthiness/financial evaluation of sub-borrowers; (b) institutional evaluation of sub-&#13;
borrowers; and (c) technical, economic and financial evaluation of sub-projects. All&#13;
eva.luations will be done by a team of analysts (one engineer, one economist/financial&#13;
analyst and one institutional specialist) assigned to each sub-borrower for the full sub-&#13;
project cycle, from evaluation through implementation, supervision and monitoring.&#13;
A. Creditworthiness and Financial Evaluation of Sub-Borrowers&#13;
6.    Upon completion of the initial Participation Agreement, CAR prepares a&#13;
creditworthiness evaluation and financial analysis of the municipality or water authority.&#13;
Financial evaluation will be done by CAR financial analysts, who are experienced in this&#13;
type of analysis.&#13;
7.    Creditworthiness is determined on the basis of the criteria set out in Brazilian&#13;
Federal Senate Resolution #69 of 1995 on debt limits for the public sector, which are&#13;
stringent. The legal limit is determined to be the higher of the following:&#13;
(a)   the global amount of performed operations in a financial exercise should&#13;
not exceed the value of the loan repayment due or overdue during the year,&#13;
or 20% of real net revenues, whichever is higher;&#13;
(b)   the maximum annual expenditures, including repayment of principal of all&#13;
operations, will not exceed the real savings margin.&#13;
8.    Evaluation of financial performance and management is based on review of the&#13;
previous three years' financial data, including breakdowns of revenue and expenditures,&#13;
trend and ratio analysis, and review of financial management and accounting practices.&#13;
9.    Because one of the project's primary objectives will be to improve local financial&#13;
management, the aim will be to: (a) improve the relationship between own and transfer&#13;
resources in the State; (b) provide adequate cost recovery for all services; (c) improve&#13;
current expenditure policies and management practices; and (d) stimulate efficient, cost-&#13;
effective investments on the basis of appropriate technical, economic and financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
93&#13;
evaluation. Thus, evaluation emphasizes the indicators to be monitored in the program:&#13;
proportion of own to transfer revenues, and per capita current and capital expenditures.&#13;
10.   The financial evaluation under the project will provide the initial base-line data&#13;
required to begin to achieve these objectives. It will also provide complementary&#13;
recommendations for improvements in financial management, accounting and auditing&#13;
which will tie into the institutional evaluation in the PRIM (see below). Furthermore, this&#13;
data will provide the basis for a municipal financial information system (FMIS) in the&#13;
State, an important deficit in the sector country-wide as identified in sector work.&#13;
11.   The summary creditworthiness evaluation for the approximately 45-50&#13;
municipalities were evaluated during appraisal, of which seven to ten would be included in&#13;
the Program's first year.&#13;
B. Institutional Evaluation of Sub-Borrowers&#13;
12.   Following completion of the institutional diagnostic forin, evaluation of municipal&#13;
institutional strengths and weaknesses is done by CAR. CAR is in the process of&#13;
establishing a group of 4-6 specialists in the area of municipal management and training&#13;
who will be dedicated full-time to PRODUR. Guidelines for this analysis are set out in the&#13;
Program's OM. The evaluation identifies areas for improvement within two primary&#13;
categories:&#13;
(a)   administrative and fiscal, to be done in conjunction with the financial&#13;
evaluation done by CAR (cadastre, taxes, tax collection performance); and&#13;
(b)   municipal planning (zoning legislation, master plans).&#13;
13.   The recommended actions would be prioritized (high, medium and low priority)&#13;
according to the following criteria:&#13;
High:    Those actions which have overall highest impact on improved municipal&#13;
financial management, particularly on own resource mobilization; contribute&#13;
directly to the economic and financial feasibility of the proposed sub-projects;&#13;
and/or strengthen municipal environmental management capacity.&#13;
Medium: Those actions which increase municipal resource management in areas other&#13;
that the focus of the project.&#13;
Low:    Those actions which are desirable but not essential to the project's objectives.&#13;
14.   Estimates for implementation time and costing are then determined. Community&#13;
participation will be an important factor in determining priorities, and both community&#13;
meetings and approval of local representative assemblies will be required prior to the&#13;
municipal government's approval of any accordo de negocia,ao. Targets of these&#13;
minimum agreed goals would be: (a) own resources as a percent of total; (b) IPTU per&#13;
capita; (c) current expenses as a percent of total.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
94&#13;
15.   Once a municipality has agreed to the accordo de negociaCao, and then&#13;
demonstrates sufficient creditworthiness, a feasibility study for investments, this may be&#13;
submitted for technical, economic and financial evaluation.&#13;
C. Technical, Economic, Financial and Environmental Evaluation of Sub-Projects&#13;
16.   The technical, economic and financial evaluation of sub-projects will be performed&#13;
according to guidelines set out in the Program's Operational Manual (Volume 2). All&#13;
evaluation procedures will employ sensitivity analysis, particularly in cases where risks are&#13;
perceived to be high, or when alternatives present similar costs and benefits.&#13;
17.   The initial technical evaluation will generally be done on the basis of feasibility&#13;
studies. The evaluation will be made by CAR engineers, with the assistance of specialized&#13;
consultants as necessary, depending on the required expertise. Engineers will ensure,&#13;
through comparative analysis, that the least-cost technical solution has been chosen and&#13;
will verify demand for services, dimensioning of proposed investments, design standards&#13;
and cost estimates, recommending changes and revisions as necessary. Under the&#13;
program, priority will be given to rehabilitation over new systems, and to low-cost&#13;
alternative technologies -- where sufficiently well-tested and risk-free, such as anaerobic&#13;
stabilization ponds for sewage treatment.&#13;
18.   For those infrastructure sub-projects with quantifiable economic benefits,&#13;
economic evaluation will be done by CAR economists, on the basis of a model prepared&#13;
with the assistance of a consultant experienced in cost-benefit analysis and familiar with&#13;
evaluation of similar types of sub-projects. A simple methodology has been selected, in&#13;
order to be widely accessible to a wide range of municipalities expected to participate in&#13;
PRODUR, since training in cost-benefit analysis for municipal authorities is among one of&#13;
the project benefits. For revenue-earning services, user charges will be considered a proxy&#13;
for willingness-to-pay (although this does not capture full benefits). For non-revenue&#13;
earning services, benefits will be determined on the basis of a Hedonic model, which&#13;
employs increased property values as a result of investments as a primary benefit&#13;
determinant. Economic costs are net of taxes, debt service payments, depreciation, etc&#13;
and represent incremental costs associated with the project. Using a discount rate which&#13;
approximates the social opportunity cost of capital, estimated to 12%, individual&#13;
investments are evaluated and ranked. A discount period of 15 years is used. If sub-&#13;
projects do not achieve the minimum hurdle of 12% economic rate of return, the project is&#13;
not accepted and is sent back to the municipal authorities with a recommendation for&#13;
measures which would improve the sub-project's viability, such as reviewing project costs&#13;
(including reviewing the technical solution proposed, if not shown to be least cost),&#13;
increasing user charges and taxes (concurrent tariff study to be recommended as part of&#13;
technical assistance). For water and sewerage investments for municipalities or municipal&#13;
companies, a marginal cost study will be recommended as part of the technical assistance&#13;
package, and results should be explicitly incorporated into the analysis. Details are set out&#13;
in Annex 7.&#13;
19.   The financial evaluation of sub-projects is designed to ensure that rates of return&#13;
meet the cost of borrowing (about 12%), to determine the payback period of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
95&#13;
investment, and determine cost recovery instruments, once the investment has been shown&#13;
to be technically viable and economically justifiable. This evaluation will be done by CAR&#13;
financial analysts, and will be linked to the financial evaluation of the municipality (which&#13;
provides the base data for the analysis of cost-recovery potential) and the financial&#13;
recommendations in the PRIM with which it must be consistent.&#13;
20.   To participate in PRODUR, sub-projects must not have environmentally-negative&#13;
impact (most in fact are estimated to have positive impacts). Thus, all proposed sub-&#13;
projects must undergo a rigorous environmental evaluation, on the basis of guidelines&#13;
established for municipal sub-projects of this nature by the State environment protection&#13;
agency (CRA). The CRA guidelines present a clear indication for municipalities of the&#13;
type of environmental screening required for municipal and project size, scope and&#13;
expected impact, whether full environmental assessment (EIA/RIMA), limited assessment&#13;
(RCA) or simple licensing. When EIA/RIMA or RCA are required, private consultants&#13;
will be contracted by the sub-borrower, and CRA will review and grant eventual licensing&#13;
for acceptable projects. Details are set out in Annex 5H.&#13;
21.   Sub-Loan Agreement. The culmination of these evaluations would be a&#13;
recommendation which leads to refinement exact priorities and agree on terms of sub-loan&#13;
agreements. The summary form makes specific recommendation on the actions to be&#13;
taken, loan amounts and conditions of lending, including targets for the three-four&#13;
standard indicators, and targets. Specifically, it would include actions and agreements to&#13;
achieve the cost-recovery targets for proposed investments and targets for the institutional&#13;
interventions. The recommendation is discussed with municipal authorities, and on the&#13;
basis of the discussion a financing contract would be signed. This recommendation form&#13;
is also used to monitor progress. The sub-loan agreement would be executed through the&#13;
financial agent.&#13;
22.   Bidding and Implementation of Investments. Municipalities would bid all&#13;
infrastructure works, with technical assistance and oversight from CAR, according to the&#13;
Program's OM, which is based on Brazilian law and the Bank's guidelines for&#13;
procurement. To the extent feasible, the cost of technical agents for sub-project&#13;
evaluation and supervision would be included in the interest rate "spread," and&#13;
municipalities would be able to choose among qualified agencies.&#13;
23.   Monitoring and Evaluation. CAR would monitor and evaluate progress according&#13;
to indicators to be agreed at negations and set out in the Program's OM. In addition to&#13;
the detailed physical, financial and operational indicators set out in Annex 51, there would&#13;
be a group of "key impact indicators" for the purpose of overall evaluation and steering of&#13;
the program, both during implementation and at mid-course. The evaluation,&#13;
recommendation and monitoring of the project will be computerized, and automated in an&#13;
integrated management information system. CAR computer technicians developed a draft&#13;
proposal for doing this work was reviewed during appraisal.&#13;

ANNEX 5F&#13;
BRAZIL&#13;
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
I. Environmental Screening and Review Procedures Under PRODUR&#13;
1.    PRODUR will finance infrastructure and urban services at the municipal level, for&#13;
which the details of the majority of sub-projects were not known at the time of project&#13;
appraisal, PRODUR is characterized as a sectoral investment program. Because of this&#13;
progranmmatic sectoral nature, and the fact that local governments are the executors of&#13;
proposed works, it is necessary to set out specific guidelines for environmental reviews&#13;
required for each type of sub-project, in order to be consistent with Brazilian legislation&#13;
and World Bank norms. During pre-appraisal an initial version of this typology was&#13;
prepared and discussed, and is outlined in Section II below. This was refined during&#13;
appraisal (however is not expected to change significantly), and all arrangements were&#13;
agreed during Negotiations. These guidelines will become part of the Operational Manual&#13;
which orients the program.&#13;
2.    The first step in environmental review of sub-projects would be preparation of a&#13;
preliminary evaluation or "screening" of each sub-project to determine the extension,&#13;
nature and seriousness of its potential environmental impacts, and the type of analysis&#13;
which would be required. On the basis of this preliminary evaluation, each sub-project&#13;
would be classified in one of three review categories:&#13;
(a)   sub-projects whose potential environmental impacts are sufficiently large or&#13;
serious and should be subjected to a broad environmental evaluation&#13;
(Study/Report on Environmental Impact - EIA/RIMA);&#13;
(b)   sub-projects whose potential environmental impacts are less significant and&#13;
should be subject to an environmental analysis that is less broad, but&#13;
however includes at least an identification of mitigatory measures and&#13;
environmental monitoring (Environmental Control Report/Plan -&#13;
RCA/PCA); and&#13;
(c)   sub-projects which will not have negative environmental impacts and which&#13;
will not require a specific environmental evaluation.&#13;
3.    Establishment of these guidelines and their enforcement is the function of the&#13;
State's environmental protection agency, the Centro de Recursos Ambientais (CRA), with&#13;
the approval of the State environmental council Conselho Estadual do Meio Ambiente&#13;
(CEPRAM; see Section III). Environmental licensing is the responsibility of CEPRAM.&#13;
This licensing is done in three stages: licensing of location (before preparation of&#13;
engineering designs, considering principally alternatives of location); (ii) license for&#13;
installation (before construction of the project, when alternatives designs are considered);&#13;
and (iii) licensing of operation (after construction and before operation).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
97&#13;
4.    Once the category of each sub-project is determined, the environmental evaluation&#13;
would be done on the basis of detailed engineering designs and/or feasibility studies, as&#13;
required. Considering the scale and probable location of sub-projects to be financed by&#13;
PRODUR, it is anticipated that the great majority of cases where some type of&#13;
environmental evaluation or analysis will be necessary will consist of preparation of&#13;
Environmental Control Reports and Plans (RCA/PCA; see para. 10).&#13;
5.    If it is necessary to undertake a full environmental assessment (EIA/RIMA) for any&#13;
given sub-project, the preparation of the EIA/RIMA would be the responsibility of the&#13;
sub-project proponent (municipality) through contracting of specialized consultant&#13;
services, and on the basis of terms of reference prepared by CRA, previously approved by&#13;
CEPRAM and consistent the Bank's guidelines, as set out in OD 4.01. A standardized&#13;
draft version of such terms of reference has been prepared by the Borrower. The analysis&#13;
of the EIA/RIMA would be done by CRA, which would issue a specific technical opinion&#13;
for consideration and approval of CEPRAM, including the conditionalities (mitigatory and&#13;
control measures and environmental monitoring) for the concession of licenses to install&#13;
and operate the sub-project&#13;
6.    Per the Bank's guidelines, the following would be essential elements of any&#13;
EIA/RIMA:&#13;
(a)   that consultation with the population affected by the sub-project and with&#13;
local NGOs is held during the process of preparing the terms of reference&#13;
for the EIA/RIMA and once draft versions of the preliminary EIA/RIMA&#13;
are available;&#13;
(b)   that; the RIMA is accessible to the public in a form which can be easily&#13;
understood; and&#13;
(c)   that an executive summary of the EAJIMJMA be prepared, describing&#13;
succinctly: (i) the legal, administrative and policy framework under which&#13;
the EIAJRIMA was prepared; (ii) the sub-project; (iii) the environmental&#13;
and socio-economic baseline data; (iv) the environmental impacts expected;&#13;
(v) the analysis of alternatives from an environmental standpoint; (vi) the&#13;
plan of mitigatory measures; (vii) environmental management and training&#13;
actions; and (viii) the environmental monitoring plan.&#13;
7.    Both for sub-projects classified in the first (EIA/RIMA) and in the second&#13;
(RCA/PCA) categories, mitigatory, compensatory and control and monitoring measures&#13;
would be recommended. The technical opinion from CRA would also include&#13;
recommendations (with costs, schedule for execution and respective institutional&#13;
responsibilities) which would become an integral part of the detailed designs for the sub-&#13;
projects. The implementation of these measures during construction and operation would&#13;
also be accompanied by the municipality and by CAR, as part of supervision.&#13;
8.    Significant involuntary resettlement (more than 100-200 individuals) is not&#13;
foreseen under this project. In cases where it may necessary to involuntarily relocate a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
98&#13;
population larger than 100-200 persons in connection with any sub-project to be&#13;
considered for financing under PRODUR, a detailed resettlement plan, acceptable to the&#13;
Bank and consistent with OD 4.30, would also be required prior to approval. It was&#13;
agreed during Negotiations that any sub-project involving such resettlement would be&#13;
subject to the prior-review and appraisal of the Bank prior to disbursement. If a smaller&#13;
number of person were to be involuntarily relocated, the following would be the minimum&#13;
requirements: (i) adequate compensation; (ii) logistical support in their move; and (iii)&#13;
financial assistance in grant form for relocation. The first year program reviewed during&#13;
appraisal was found, on the basis of engineering designs and site visits, not to involve any&#13;
resettlement.&#13;
H. PRODUR Sub-Project Categories and Probable First-Year Investments&#13;
9.    CRA has prepared a draft version of a State-wide classification system for&#13;
environmental screening and review, based on practice within the State and on the&#13;
experience of other states, such as Parana, Minas Gerais, and Ceara which already have&#13;
such regulations established. The draft guidelines proposed by CRA break sup-projects&#13;
into groups by type and by size (determined by design standards, such as diameter of pipe,&#13;
or measures of impact, such as number of hectares affected).&#13;
10.   As noted earlier, given the types of proposed sub-projects to be financed under&#13;
PRODUR, many investments will not require review and where review will be required, it&#13;
will usually be in the form of a PCA/RCA. It is expected that the requirement for&#13;
EIA/RIMAs will be rare, and likely to be only for large sewage treatment and solid waste&#13;
disposition sub-projects, or larger integrated urbanization sub-projects. The types of sub-&#13;
projects actually proposed by CAR that would be subject to analysis or evaluation and&#13;
licensing are:&#13;
Table 5F-1: PRODUR Sub-Projects and Environmental Reviews&#13;
Type of Sub-Project                       Type of Environmental Review Proposed*&#13;
Urban upgrading in low-income areas       Licensing or PCA&#13;
Water supply systems                      Licensing or PCA&#13;
Sewerage networks                         Licensing or PCA&#13;

Microdrainage, paving, streetlighting,    Licensing&#13;
arborization&#13;
* Where "or" is indicated, type of review would depend on size and impact of the&#13;
proposed sub-project. Detailed criteria are set out in the Project File.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
99&#13;
11.   It should be noted that integrated sub-projects, for example sewerage trunk&#13;
infrastructure, macrodrainage, and paving together, would likely require either a PCA or a&#13;
full EIA/RIMA (depending on size and impact), and if involving resettlement would also&#13;
require a resettlement plan. Thus in addition to the guidelines above, in order to&#13;
adequately screen for such integrated multi-sectoral sub-projects it would be agreed that&#13;
any sub-project expected to cost more than US$5 million, and any sewage treatment or&#13;
solid waste disposal sub-project expected to cost more than US$2 million, would be&#13;
appraised by the Bank prior to approval of the sub-project. This would be monitored in&#13;
the project's quarterly reports. Further, it would be a condition of disbursement that all&#13;
EIA/RIMAs required under the agreed guidelines, and including mitigatory plans and&#13;
resettlement plans, be satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
12.   Sub-projects in the project's first year will be located in seven municipalities. All&#13;
of the municipalities have populations in the 65,000 to 200,000 range, and so are on the&#13;
large side of the potential universe of borrowing municipalities. It should be noted that&#13;
the seven municipalities of the first year are all larger, regional poles. It is more likely that&#13;
environmental review would be required for investments in these cities, while the pattern&#13;
of investments in subsequent years is likely to involve smaller municipalities and smaller&#13;
sub-projects, and thus likely less requirement for full environmental reviews. The&#13;
investments proposed, and the likely environmental screening category, are shown below:&#13;

]I. Environmental Institutions and Policies in Bahia&#13;
13.   Environmental policy in the State of Bahia is guided by State law No. 3,858&#13;
(1980), and by regulation t1Orough State decree no. 28,687 (1982), which provide for the&#13;
requirement of environmental licensing for certain urban infrastructure and related&#13;
investments, particularly sewerage or solid waste treatment or final disposition, water&#13;
resource investments and housing development. The federal government's environmental&#13;
council (CONAMA) also stipulates licensing for sanitation-related investments, through&#13;
resolutions no. 001 (1986) and no. 05 (1988) which note that the detailing of specific&#13;
criteria and standards would be left to the States.&#13;
14.   The State environmental agency, Centro de Recursos Ambientais, or CRA, was&#13;
established in 1980, with the same state law which established State environmental policy.&#13;
At the same time, the State's environmental council, Conselho Estadual do Meio&#13;
Ambiente, or CEPRAM, which authorizes environment-related decisions and policies, was&#13;
established.&#13;
15.   CRA is responsible for elaborating the State's Environmental Plan and for the&#13;
following activities: coordinating and executing State environmental recuperation policy,&#13;
identifying activities of the public power and private initiative which could potentially&#13;
cause environmental impact, establishing norms for environmental control according to&#13;
directives established by CEPRAM, environmental education, maintaining information&#13;
systems related to environment and pollution, evaluating environmental quality and&#13;
impacts, preparing inventories of environmental resources, proposing to CEPRAM&#13;
standards for quality and criteria for sustainable management, and issuing technical&#13;
opinions related to concession of licensing for location, construction and operation which&#13;
may cause environmental impact, based on the previous analysis specified.&#13;
16.   An organization chart for CRA is shown below. Although once based largely in&#13;
the metropolitan region of Salvador, as a result of much of the State's industry being&#13;
centralized there, CRA has established regional offices in Ilheus, Jequie, Barreiras, Feira&#13;
de Santana and Juazeiro, as well as a dedicated office in the petrochemical pole of&#13;
Camacari in the RMS. This regionalization has accompanied the industrial, mining and&#13;
agricultural growth in the State.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
SELECTED KEY MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
1.    A detailed set of monitoring indicators, and methodology for calculation, source of&#13;
data, standards for measurement and levels (where applicable) would be set out in the&#13;
project's Operational Manual. These indicators would include standard physical&#13;
measurements of works completed, unit costs per sub-project, number of training and&#13;
technical assistance interventions, etc., as well as financial/economic measures such as&#13;
disbursement rates and unit costs per sub-project.&#13;
2.    In order to measure the impact of the project, as well as physical and financial&#13;
progress, a group of key monitoring indicators would also be selected from the larger&#13;
group of monitoring indicators. A sample of likely indicators are set out below, and&#13;
divided into five categories: (a) a group of selected "key impact indicator" (which have&#13;
established targets that attempt to demonstrate the expected impact of the project): (b)&#13;
infrastructure investments; (c) institutional development; (d) financial/fiscal; and (e)&#13;
project implementation. Because of the difficulty in establishing reliable base data for the&#13;
whole State, preliminary estimates of status for the indicators below would be part of the&#13;
first year's quarterly reports, and would be monitored (and adjusted) thereafter as a&#13;
normal part of project reporting, along with the physical and financial measurements of&#13;
project progress.&#13;

ANNEX 5J&#13;
BRAZIL&#13;
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
The Project&#13;
1.    Project Description and Objectives - The Bahia Municipal Infrastructure&#13;
Development and Management Project (PRODUR) is designed to be the first phase in a&#13;
long-term State program to support development of local financial management capacity&#13;
and priority infrastructure investments, the former through direct financing, and the latter&#13;
through an urban development fund. Through the proposed project, the Bank loan and&#13;
State counterpart funds would capitalize the PRODUR Municipal Development Fund&#13;
(FUNDUTRBANO) which would on-lend resources to municipalities for economically-&#13;
viable urban infrastructure investments on the basis of well-defined sub-borrower&#13;
creditworthiness and sub-project eligibility criteria. Poverty-targeted urban upgrading&#13;
would be financed by a combination of loan, grant and local contributions.&#13;
2.    The objectives of the proposed project would be to: (a) strengthen the&#13;
institutional and financial management of urban municipalities so as to enable them to&#13;
better manage their resources in support of the State's decentralization and economic&#13;
growth strategies; and (b) improve the living conditions of the State's urban residents,&#13;
primarily the urban poor, through: (i) establishing a mechanism for sustainable long-term&#13;
financing of priority urban infrastructure for local governments; (ii) development of&#13;
detailed, reliable systems for mapping of urban poverty in the State to guide State and&#13;
local investment strategies; and (iii) a poverty-targeted program of urban upgrading in&#13;
critically poor urban areas.&#13;
3.    The proposed project would consist of (i) an institutional development component&#13;
to upgrade municipal financial administration, in particular property tax records and&#13;
collection; (ii) a basic urban infrastructure component to improve water, sewerage,&#13;
drainage, solid waste, street paving and lighting in the municipalities of Bahia; and (iii) an&#13;
urban upgrading component, consisting of about 20% of the funds for infrastructure which&#13;
would be targeted to very poor urban areas. Poverty mapping at the State level would&#13;
also be undertaken.&#13;
4.    Economic and Financial Analysis - Economic cost-benefit analysis would be&#13;
done to determine project viability. The minimum criteria for sub-projects would be that&#13;
they provide an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) which meets or exceeds the&#13;
opportunity cost of capital, for which the rate of 12% serves as a proxy. In the case of&#13;
revenue-earning services, such as water, sewerage and public lighting, economic benefits&#13;
would be calculated on the basis of tariff revenues as a proxy for willingness to pay. In&#13;
the case of non-revenue earning services, such as drainage and paving, economic benefits&#13;
would be based on increased land values as a result of the infrastructure improvements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
107&#13;
For those sub-projects estimated to cost less than US$500,000 per capita benefits would&#13;
be sufficient, providing the technical solution is least-cost and benefits are shown to be&#13;
largely within the municipality. Financial cost-benefit analysis would provide the basis for&#13;
determining cost-recovery. All infrastructure sub-projects (with the exception of some&#13;
sewage treatment and solid waste disposal), are expected to achieve full cost recovery.&#13;
Sub-project investments would be linked to specific targets to increase user fees and taxes,&#13;
to be agreed with municipalities in the PRIM and reflected in the terms and conditions of&#13;
sub-loans for infrastructure investments.&#13;
5.     Project Risks - The major project risk is implementation of the institutional&#13;
development program, which is a challenging component requiring significant advance&#13;
planning, in particular in a state with varied municipal institutional capacities. For this&#13;
reason, agreed technical assistance and training programs and targets for municipalities to&#13;
enter the project's first-year program have been prepared and progress on the institutional&#13;
development component will be linked explicitly to the infrastructure component for all&#13;
sub-borrowers. This risk is also somewhat mitigated through the executing agency's&#13;
access to the experience of other states with similar projects. There are few technical risks&#13;
associated with the project, since most infrastructure investments are of a routine nature,&#13;
with the exception of certain sewerage treatment sub-projects which may employ low-cost&#13;
alternative technologies still somewhat innovative and less-well tested. Amounts allocated&#13;
to this type of sub-project are limited, and Bank prior-review of sub-project proposals&#13;
minimizes this risk. There is a risk that municipal elections in 1996 may be disruptive to&#13;
the project, however the fact that the State government recently took office (January&#13;
1995) for a four-year term which coincides with the project implementation period,&#13;
diminishes this risk somewhat by ensuring continuity at the State level. The executing&#13;
agency is an experienced State agency with a good record in implementing projects&#13;
financed by multilateral agencies.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
108&#13;
6.    Municipal Development Fund (FUNDURBANO) - The PRODUR&#13;
FUNDUJRBANO would be established by the State and loan administration and&#13;
management of the fund would be undertaken by DESENBANCO. About US$84.0&#13;
million equivalent of the Bank loan would capitalize the FUNDURBANO, together with&#13;
about US$75 million of State resources. This is equal to the full amount less about&#13;
US$16.0 million, which, together with State counterpart would finance the institutional&#13;
development, municipal reform and the low-income urban upgrading component, which&#13;
would be financed separately from the FUNDURBANO. The FUNDURBANO would&#13;
on-lend to municipalities for up to 85% of the cost of eligible infrastructure sub-projects.&#13;
The remaining counterpart (minimum 15%) would be provided by sub-borrowers, through&#13;
payment of invoices (or in-kind labor contributions, in the case of smaller municipalities).&#13;
Sub-loans would be made to sub-borrowers in three categories, with terms of up to five,&#13;
ten and fifteen years (including grace periods of one to three years), depending on the&#13;
cost-recovery profile of the investments&#13;
2. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
7.    Institutional Arrangements - The Borrower would be the State of Bahia. The&#13;
State would use the proceeds of the Bank loan and its own counterpart funds to capitalize&#13;
a municipal development fund (FUNDURBANO), to be managed by a commercial bank&#13;
to be selected under procedures to be agreed. The State's Companhia de&#13;
Desenvolvimento e Afiao Regional (CAR) would be the project's executing agency. CAR&#13;
would execute Parts A-D of the project. CAR would have primary responsibility for all&#13;
aspects of project implementation, including evaluation of sub-borrowers' financial and&#13;
institutional capacity, diagnosis of institutional requirements and formulation of technical&#13;
assistance and training packages, evaluation of technical, economic and financial feasibility&#13;
of sub-projects, and all general aspects of management, operation and monitoring of the&#13;
project. These procedures would all be undertaken on the basis of an agreed Operational&#13;
Manuals (para. 2.4 below). Environmental evaluations would be done through the State's&#13;
Centro de Recursos Ambientais (CRA; see Annex 5H). While CAR would handle all day-&#13;
to-day activities of PRODUR, program management would be handled by a Board of&#13;
Directors. The Board would be chaired by the State Secretariat of Planning, and&#13;
membership would include representatives from the Secretariat of Finance, other&#13;
government agencies, and the Association of Municipalities. CAR would serve as the&#13;
Executive Secretariat of the Board. The organization chart for PRODUR is presented in&#13;
Annex 5A. Institutional arrangements for the proposed project are detailed in Annex SB.&#13;
8.    The State will strengthen the capabilities of CAR in the area of providing technical&#13;
assistance to municipalities. Plans include restructuring CAR into three Departments: (a)&#13;
Regional Development (for rural-oriented programs); (b) Urban Development; and (c)&#13;
Municipal Action (for support to institutional strengthening of local governments). While&#13;
the management and infrastructure aspects of PRODUR would fall under the Urban&#13;
Development Department, the Municipal Action Department would handle the&#13;
institutional development component. CAR also has plans to establish about twelve&#13;
additional regional offices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
109&#13;
9.    Regarding specific project tasks, CAR has established a financial nucleus in the&#13;
Urban Development division, which has been trained in public financial analysis, as well as&#13;
similar groups for economic and technical evaluation of sub-projects. CAR would hire&#13;
consultants when and as necessary to assist with project implementation.&#13;
10.   Operational Arrangements - Operational arrangements are set out in the&#13;
Program's Operational Manual (OM). Final versions of each of the volumes would be&#13;
agreed during Negotiations and the PRODllR program would be operated in accordance&#13;
with the OM. The OM would be simplified and summarized in small leaflets which would&#13;
be used in the marketing of the program. The OM is described further in Annex SC.&#13;
11.   Eligible Sub-borrowers - The PRODUR program would be open to almost all&#13;
municipalities in the State which meet the Program's eligibility criteria, with the exception&#13;
of those localities eligible for the NRPA program and its planned successor. While there&#13;
are approximately 400 municipalities in the target group of eligible municipalities, it was&#13;
agreed that the probable beneficiary group would be those municipalities with populations&#13;
over 15,000 (approximately 220 in the State, representing about 80% of the total&#13;
population). Full sub-borrower eligibility criteria are detailed in the Program's Orientation&#13;
Operational Manual referenced above. Key steps for entry are as follows:&#13;
(a)   signature of a Participation Agreement (Convenio de Adhesdo) which&#13;
formalizes municipal interest in PRODUR and commitment to its&#13;
principles;&#13;
(b)   completion of an institutional and financial diagnosis, according to rapid&#13;
assessment methodology developed and tested under similar programs in&#13;
other states;&#13;
(c)   establishment of an agreed set of institution-building actions, with clearly-&#13;
defined performance targets, outlined in a Municipal Reform and&#13;
Institutional Development Plan (PRIM);&#13;
12.   To undertake infrastructure sub-loans, municipalities and water agencies would&#13;
demonstrate:&#13;
(a)   demonstrated compliance with Federal legislation on payment of taxes and&#13;
other obligations;&#13;
(b)   demonstrated debt capacity according to federal guidelines for public&#13;
sector borrowing (set out in Senate Resolution #69, 1995);&#13;
(c)   availability of required counterpart funds (minimum 25% of proposed&#13;
project costs); and&#13;
(d)   ability to provide a guarantee (typically ICMS contribution).&#13;
13.   Legal Arrangements - Implementation arrangements for the project would be&#13;
formalized in the following legal documents:&#13;
a)    State law authorizing the State to borrow from the Bank and establishing&#13;
the FUNTDURBANO;&#13;
State decree regulating the FUNDURBANO;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
110&#13;
b)    Regulations of FUNDURBANO;&#13;
c)    Contract between the State of Bahia, CAR and the financial agent to&#13;
implement the program;&#13;
d)    Model participation agreement between the State, CAR and municipality;&#13;
e)    Model negotiation agreement between CAR and municipality (for the&#13;
institutional development component);&#13;
f)    Model contract between CAR and municipality for implementation of a&#13;
sub-project; and&#13;
g)    Model municipal law authorizing a municipality to participate in PRODUR.&#13;
14.   Draft versions of all of these documents have been prepared and were reviewed&#13;
during Appraisal. Agreement on the final version of the model Participation Agreements&#13;
and Sub-Loan Contracts were reached during negotiations. Agreement was reached that&#13;
all conditions present in the legal agreements between the Bank and CAR, the State and&#13;
the Federal Government, would be reflected in the sub-agreements, as necessary.&#13;
15.   Bank's Role During Implementation - The Bank would ensure that: (i) project&#13;
objectives are being achieved; (ii) legal covenants are being fulfilled; (iii) the Bank's&#13;
procurement guidelines are being applied; (iv) cost recovery measures were being&#13;
achieved; (v) sub-borrower and sub-project selection processes are transparent and that&#13;
criteria agreed in the Operational Manuals are being applied; and (vi) provide technical&#13;
assistance in selected areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage (i.e. regional and&#13;
sectoral best practices, environmental assessment, resettlement, economic and financial&#13;
evaluation). This would be done through periodic supervision missions (about two per&#13;
year), frequent communication with the Borrower, principally through electronic mail, and&#13;
review of periodic reports and studies. The Bank would review procurement processes on&#13;
a ex-ante basis, all procurement of goods, works, and consultant services over the limits&#13;
established as follows: (i) all contracts for civil works estimated to cost the equivalent of&#13;
US$5.0 million or more; (ii) all contracts for goods estimated to cost US$300,000 or&#13;
more; (iii) all consultant contracts estimated to cost US$50,000 or more for individuals&#13;
and US$100,000 or more for firms; and (iv) terms of reference for all consultant services,&#13;
regardless of value. In addition, the Bank would review all sub-projects expected to cost&#13;
the equivalent of US$5 rmillion or more (US$2 million in the case of the first three sewage&#13;
treatment and solid waste disposition sub-projects) would be subject to specific review&#13;
and appraisal of all technical, economic, financial and environmental aspects by the Bank.&#13;
Given the large number of small and medium-sized sub-projects expected during this&#13;
project, ex-post reviews on the basis of spot-checking would be undertaken below these&#13;
amounts during supervision. Sub-projects would be considered for review until three&#13;
months before the project's Closing Date. A Mid-Term Review will be carried-out by the&#13;
Bank and the Borrower approximately three years after Effectiveness to assess the&#13;
project's progress and its achievement of objectives, and to reorient implementation if&#13;
deemed necessary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11i&#13;
3. Implementation Schedule&#13;
16.   The project's implementation schedule, which outlines key actions in project&#13;
execution for smooth implementation is attached and will be finalized during negotiations.&#13;
This will be further detailed through the use of project management software, to be&#13;
established and programmed during the project's inception mission. Of primary&#13;
importance are targets for Participation Agreements with municipalities, procurement of&#13;
major works, and progress on technical assistance interventions. This schedule is to be&#13;
prepared on a rolling quarterly basis. Arrangements for project supervision are outlined in&#13;
the supervision plan in Annex 5K. Physical project supervision will be carried out by the,&#13;
regional offices of CAR, the DU and its consultants on the basis of site checks.&#13;
4. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
17.   In addition to CAR's site visits, sub-borrowers would be expected to present&#13;
periodic progress reports on project implementation (with periodicity established in sub-&#13;
loan contracts), on the basis of which CAR would furnish concise quarterly progress&#13;
reports to the Bank. These reports would compare actual and forecast progress. The&#13;
detailed range of project monitoring indicators is provided in the OM (Volume 5). These&#13;
include standard agreed performance indicators monitoring physical, financial and&#13;
operational progress of individual sub-projects, and aggregated project performance for all&#13;
sub-projects. A set of "key impact indicators" and targets, selected from among the group&#13;
of indicators to be monitored during the project, would be agreed, including inter alia: (a)&#13;
number of Participation Agreements signed; (b) number of PIMs completed; (c) overall&#13;
project completion, measured in expenditures; (d) discretionary as a percent of total State&#13;
transfers to municipalities; and (e) average property tax per capita in the State (see Annex&#13;
5K). These indicators, among others, would be monitored in quarterly reports.&#13;
Agreement was reached during Negotiations that quarterly reports be furnished no later&#13;
than 30 days after the end of each of the following quarters: March 31, June 30 and&#13;

BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURF, DEVELOPMENT&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
SUPFRVISION PLAN&#13;
1.    A supervision strategy has been tentatively formulated, emphasizing: (i) a thorough&#13;
and detailed project inception or launch mission, the aim of which will be to test the&#13;
soundness of the basic project planning, implementation and monitoring tools; (ii) periodic&#13;
shorter missions of local consultants, in addition to at least two full supervision missions&#13;
per year; and (iii) establishment of electronic mail communication between the Bank&#13;
headquarters in Washington and ihe project office in Salvador.&#13;
2.    To launch the project, an inception mission is planned for the third quarter of&#13;
FY97 (February 1997). The mission would be scheduled for about one and a half weeks,&#13;
and would comprise a sanitary engineer, an environmental specialist, institutional&#13;
development specialist, economist and operations assistant in addition to the task manager&#13;
(and brief visits from procurement and disbursement staff, as needed). Following project&#13;
inception two additional supervision missions would be held during the fiscal year, in order&#13;
to build on the momentum of project inception and to iron-out any implementation&#13;
difficulties. Local consultants would make periodic visits to bolster implementation&#13;
between missions during this critical first year. For FY97 and FY98, a minimum of two&#13;
full-scale supervision mission would be scheduled per year consisting of a four-person&#13;
core team (engineer, institutional development specialist, environmental specialist and task&#13;
manager), complete with site visits, along with one to two shorter, skeleton-staffed&#13;
supervision visits during the year, also utilizing local consultants for between-mission&#13;
consultative visits.&#13;
3.    During project preparation, standardized reporting arrangements were discussed&#13;
and would be agreed during project launch, in order to streamline supervision. A mid-&#13;
term review would be scheduled for approximately the fourth quarter of FY2000, for&#13;
about one and a half weeks, and including an engineer, and environmental specialist, an&#13;
economist, institutional development specialist and operations assistant in addition to the&#13;
task manager. The objectives of the mnid-term review would include, inter alia:&#13;
(a)   review of progress and achievements on the institutional development&#13;
component;&#13;
(b)   review the beneficiary population in the context of poverty mapping and&#13;
make any mid-term adjustments required;&#13;
(c)   review of key performance indicators (i.e., ex-post rate of return&#13;
evaluation; increase in own-source revenue collections);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
115&#13;
(d)   review of the allocation of resources among sub-components and proposed&#13;
re-allocation, as necessary, depending on project progress and consistency&#13;
with project objectives;&#13;
(e)   effectiveness of institutional and implementation arrangements, and degree&#13;
to which these could be simplified and/or adjusted to improve project&#13;
implementation efficiency and effectiveness;&#13;
(f)   review the success of the poverty targeted urban upgrading component and&#13;
make mnid-course adjustments as required;&#13;
(g)   determine the appropriateness of use of simplified economic evaluation of&#13;
smaller sub-projects (US$500,000 or less) using indicators monitored&#13;
during the first years of project implementation; and&#13;
(h)   assess CRA's effectiveness in environmental review of sub-projects.&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;
BRAZIL&#13;
BAHIA MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
EVALUATION OF SUB-PROJECTS&#13;
1.    Methodology. Most Sub-projects proposed by municipalities for financing under&#13;
PRODUR will be subject to five stages of evaluation: (i) technical; (ii) economic; (iii)&#13;
financial; (iv) environmental; and (v) public health. Subprojects such as water and&#13;
sewerage network eytensions, water system improvements, drainage, paving and street&#13;
lighting investments, have readily quantifiable benefits. These sub-projects will undergo&#13;
economic and financial evaluation according to agreed selection criteria and&#13;
methodologies which are set out in the project's OM. A simple methodology has been&#13;
followed, in order to be widely accessible to a wide range of municipalities expected to&#13;
participate in PRODUR.&#13;
2.    Technical Evaluation. Through in-house engineering expertise and external&#13;
consultations where necessary, CAR will examine the appropriateness of the specifications&#13;
of each proposed subproject, ensuring that least cost solutions are applied, as well as&#13;
verifying that a demand exists for the proposed services.&#13;
3.    Economic Evaluation. This will use cost: benefit analysis to estimate economic&#13;
rates of return (ERRs) of proposed investments which must exceed the long term&#13;
opportunity cost of capital in Brazil, currently estimated at 12%. For non-revenue&#13;
generating services--notably paving and drainage--increased land values resulting from the&#13;
improvements would be used to measure benefits. For revenue generating services--such&#13;
as water, sewerage and solid waste collection--financial flows from payments made by&#13;
users, less taxes, would be used as a proxy for economic benefits.&#13;
4.    Since the proposed project takes a programmatic approach to financing municipal&#13;
investments, an exact forecast of investments for the project implementation period is not&#13;
possible. Based on estimated project costs and performance of similar projects, some 75%&#13;
of investments should have readily quantifiable benefits under the selected methodologies.&#13;
Project components without quantifiable benefits, such as institutional development,&#13;
would not be subject to economic evaluation. The financial benefits from technical&#13;
assistance investments in the area of fiscal and financial modernization would be evaluated&#13;
and closely monitored, however.&#13;
5.    Economic benefits measured for PRODUR's economic evaluation would be as&#13;
follows. For revenue-earning services, such as water supply and sewerage, user charges&#13;
would be used as a proxy for willingness-to-pay benefits (although this does not capture&#13;
full benefits such as consumer surplus). For non-revenue earning services, such as paving&#13;
and drainage, benefits would be determined through increased property values--expressed&#13;
as a fifteen year benefit stream--resulting from the improved living conditions provided by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the investments. Estimates of property value changes would be made empirically for each&#13;
proposed subproject by the municipalities and verified by CAR, by comparing with-project&#13;
and without-project scenarios. This would involve observing the difference between the&#13;
value of the unimproved area slated for investment, and the value of a similar area already&#13;
served by urban infrastructure of the kind proposed. Local real estate agents and residents&#13;
would be the primary source of this market information, which would be cross-checked&#13;
with data from similar projects elsewhere in Brazil and consolidated into a PRODUR&#13;
project cost and benefit data base. As more and more sub-projects are evaluated, this data&#13;
base would serve as a basic reference for verifying the accuracy of subproject information&#13;
contained in applications for PRODUR financing. Experience from Bank financed projects&#13;
in other states of Brazil has shown that, through the stronger demand for environmentally&#13;
improved areas, land values can increase significantly after infrastructure and urban service&#13;
improvements in low income neighborhoods.&#13;
6.    Economic evaluation will take the economic costs of sub-projects to be all capital&#13;
expenditures and all necessary re-investment, plus recurrent expenditures for operation&#13;
and maintenance. All economic costs and benefits are assumed to be net of taxes and&#13;
duties. Subproject selection criteria would ensure that least cost technical solutions are&#13;
selected. As a priority, the proposed project would first optimize the use of existing&#13;
facilities. A fifteen year discount period would be used as a standardized economic life of&#13;
the investments. A model for each type of sub-project has been developed by the&#13;
Borrower for use in sub-project screening and evaluation.&#13;
7.    Economic evaluation for selected sub-projects in a number of cities and sectors&#13;
were reviewed during appraisal. Based on the sample of sub-projects reviewed--paving&#13;
and water supply sub-projects--it is expected that economic rates of return for this type of&#13;
investment will be of the order of 12%-35%. Ex-post economic evaluation conducted for&#13;
such investments undertaken in other states (with similar programs) indicate rates of&#13;
return in the range of 12-90%. For Loan Negotiations, the Borrower provided finalized&#13;
cost-benefit analyses of the first year program of the municipality whose investments are in&#13;
the most advanced stage of preparation. Subproject evaluation of the remainder of the first&#13;
year program for other cities would be a condition of Loan Effectiveness.&#13;
8.    During the first half of project implementation, responsibility for undertaking the&#13;
subproject cost-benefit analyses will rest primarily with the PRODUR evaluation team in&#13;
CAR, who will build up a data base of subproject cost and benefit information. At the&#13;
same time, it is expected that CAR will be able to fully build-up an in-house capability in&#13;
these evaluation tasks. Thereafter, during the second half of project implementation, CAR&#13;
will provide technical assistance to participating municipalities in subproject evaluation so&#13;
that each participating city may be able to train its own staff and develop its own capacity&#13;
to assess the performance of investments and determine priorities for their own municipal&#13;
investment program based upon efficiency criteria implied by the cost-benefit analysis.&#13;
9.    Financial Evaluation and Cost Recovery. Where financial costs are benefits are&#13;
clearly discernible in the case of revenue generating services, PRODUR would estimate&#13;
the internal financial rates of return (FRR) of proposed sub-projects. This estimate would&#13;
help determine cost-recovery requirements and establish guidelines for sub-loan terms and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
121&#13;
conditions. Benefits would be the same as for the economic evaluation. Costs would&#13;
include all taxes, debt service and other charges. The financial evaluation would use&#13;
financial rates of return (FRRs) as the basis for determining cost recovery. All revenue&#13;
generating investments are expected to achieve a FRR for the municipality of at least 6%.&#13;
10.   Environmental screening. This would be ensured through the compliance, where&#13;
appropriate, of all sub-projects with the State's own rigorous environmental requirements&#13;
(details: Annex 5F).&#13;
11.   Evaluation of Public Health Impacts. Because of their high up-front capital cost&#13;
and relatively small financial returns, sewerage sub-projects rarely generate sufficient&#13;
measurable benefits to justify the investment in purely financial or economic terms. For&#13;
example, recent experience in the state of Minas Gerais has shown that using tariffs paid&#13;
by beneficiaries as a proxy for such benefits, estimated internal rates of return seldom&#13;
exceeded 6%. In spite of this, sewerage systems are believed to generate large health&#13;
benefits over long periods, especially to a low income communities which formerly may&#13;
have had no basic sanitation service. These benefits are not captured by the tariffs that&#13;
beneficiaries typically pay, or even those they may be willing to pay.&#13;
12.   For this reason, the health benefits likely to accrue from sewerage investments&#13;
proposed by the project would be examined separately by PRODUR. Introducing this kind&#13;
of basic sanitation into an area of a city which previously had none can significantly reduce&#13;
the incidence of diarrhea and waterborne intestinal diseases among the beneficiary&#13;
population. According to Bahia State health officials, at least 50% of cases of these&#13;
diseases can be eliminated through basic sanitation improvements of the kind envisioned&#13;
under the project. In Bahia, waterborne intestinal diseases are responsible for 4.0% of&#13;
deaths among the population as a whole, three times as much as mortality resulting from&#13;
traffic accidents. Children are particularly vulnerable to these diseases, which account for&#13;
17.1% of infant mortality in the State of Bahia.3&#13;
13.   This method involves estimating DALYs (disability adjusted life years) lost&#13;
through specific diseases. The DALY measures healthy life years (DALYs) lost per group&#13;
of 1,000 persons affected by a combination of mortality and disability caused by each of a&#13;
series of specific diseases. DALYs are expressed as the present value of the weighted&#13;
averages of the estimated years equivalent lost among different age groups. The 1993&#13;
WDR tabulates observed DALY values for 1990 by disease and by region of the world.4&#13;
14.   For the purposes of the project, the estimate of DALYs saved in Bahia was based&#13;
upon three important premises:&#13;
*     The number of DALYs per disease and 1,000 people in the urban areas of Bahia&#13;
have the same value as the 1993 WDR estimates for Latin America as a whole.&#13;

4As proposed in the World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health (WDR-93).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
122&#13;
*     Only DALYs resulting from two disease groups are susceptible to reduction&#13;
through sewerage systems: (i) diarrhea, and (ii) worm infections. According to the&#13;
1993 WDR, these two groups together account for 8.2% of all DALYs in LAC, or&#13;
19.1 DALYs per annum per 1,000 people in the region.&#13;
*     Sewerage projects will reduce the incidence of these diseases among the people&#13;
directly served by 50%, thereby eliminating half the respective DALYs lost per&#13;
annum.&#13;
*     To establish a methodology to be used under the proposed project, first the total&#13;
number of DALYs saved through the project we examined, and then the cost&#13;
effectiveness of the project investment with respect to each DALY saved, was&#13;
estimated. The latter was measured by the investment cost per DALY.&#13;
15.   Preliminary results indicate that a sewerage scheme benefiting 3,600 people in the&#13;
city of Amargosa could save 34 DALYs annually among the community over the life of&#13;
the investment at an initial cost of R$5,355 per DALY saved. Additional results for other&#13;
cities will be forthcoming by Loan Effectiveness.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The primary objectives of the Bahia
            Municipal Infrastructure Development and Management Project
            (PRODUR) are to improve the urban poor living conditions,
            through developing detailed, reliable systems for mapping
            urban poverty and a poverty-targeted program of urban
            upgrading in critically poor urban areas; to increase
            municipal public sector efficiency and sustainability in
            financing key municipal services; to support privatization
            and service delivery concessioning; increase cost recovery
            of municipal investments; and to strengthen municipal
            financial management capacity.  The project will consist of
            four primary components: (1) the Municipal Reform component
            will finance basic reforms to reduce the municipal
            government's role in providing urban infrastructure and
            social service delivery, by privatizing or using private
            concessions; (2) the Institutional Development component
            consists of technical assistance, training, and equipment
            purchases for municipalities and for the state regional
            development authority, as well as modernization and
            administrative reforms studies; (3) the Urban Infrastructure
            component will focus on investment projects in urban
            infrastructure, water, sewage, solid waste, paving and
            drainage, and complementary, and regional investments; and
            (4) the urban upgrading component, targeted to areas with
            average household income below a maximum income ceiling will
            consist of a package of integrated urban infrastructure
            investments;  to repair macro and micro-damage,
            complementary investments, and regional investments; and (4)
            the urban upgrading component, targeted to areas with
            average household income below a maximum income threshold
            level, will consist of a package of integrated urban
            infrastructure investments.
