     BOX 1: OBA FOR CONNECTIONS TO WATER AND SEWERAGE IN UNPLANNED URBAN&#13;
     SETTLEMENTS IN MOROCCO&#13;
     In Morocco, GPOBA provided a US$7 million grant to three service providers (both public and private) to extend water and sewer-&#13;
     age services into unplanned urban settlements which were formerly excluded from regular service provision. Launched in 2007, the&#13;
     project aims to connect 11,300 households to piped water and sewerage. The output is a simultaneous connection to piped water&#13;
     and sewerage for poor households. The subsidy is paid in two installments: 60 percent on completion of the connection and 40&#13;
     percent upon verification of at least 6 months of sustained service. Verification is carried out by an independent third party. Details&#13;
     of the schemes and the costs of the subsidy vary by operator. Unit subsidies for sewerage connections vary from US$421 in Casa-&#13;
     blanca to US$913 in Meknès, due to differing unit costs and differing ability to pay on the part of households in different cities. Ini-&#13;
     tial progress under the scheme was slow, largely due to a lack of familiarity with this type of scheme, investment delays upstream&#13;
     and lack of clarity over land tenure. The pace of investment has substantially picked up in subsequent years, with Amendis in&#13;
     Tangiers having delivered the expected number of connections ahead of schedule. The Government of Morocco is now exploring&#13;
     options for scaling up the scheme at national level.&#13;

            Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid
            (GPOBA), in association with the Water and Sanitation
            Program (WSP), initiated a study to examine whether OBA has
            the potential to improve the delivery of public financing to
            the sanitation sector and improve access to sustainable
            sanitation services. The first phase of the study consisted
            of reviewing experience to date with OBA for sanitation and
            examining the potential for its application. Phase one led
            to the publication of a GPOBA working paper. During phase
            two, concept notes are being prepared to identify how OBA
            approaches could be introduced in a number of sanitation
            projects or programs that are either ongoing or in the
            process of being designed. Key questions raised in the study
            included: What explains such limited use of OBA-financing
            approaches for sanitation? How can OBA subsidies be
            delivered to providers of sanitation services? What other
            components (e.g., support services to small-scale
            independent providers, micro-finance, etc.) may be required
            to improve chances of success of OBA schemes for sanitation?
