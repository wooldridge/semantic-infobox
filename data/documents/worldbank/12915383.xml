&#13;
NOTE 1 -- ORgANIZATION&#13;
The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre) was established on&#13;
October 14, 1966 to provide facilities for the conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes&#13;
between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States. The Centre provides such&#13;
facilities for cases brought under the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, or&#13;
where parties involved so request, under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission&#13;
on International Trade Law. On February 13, 1967, the International Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development (the Bank) and the Centre entered into Administrative Arrangements which were&#13;
effective as of the date of the establishment of the Centre. The Memorandum of Administrative&#13;
Arrangements (the Memorandum) provides that, except to the extent that ICSID, pursuant to its&#13;
Administrative and Financial Regulations, collects funds from the parties to proceedings to cover the&#13;
Centre's administrative expenses, the Bank shall provide reasonable facilities and services to ICSID, as&#13;
described in Notes 2 and 8 without charge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 -- SIgNIfICANT ACCOUNTINg POLICIES&#13;
Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation: The financial statements have been&#13;
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of&#13;
America (US GAAP) and with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The policy&#13;
adopted is that considered most appropriate to the circumstances of ICSID having regard to its legal&#13;
requirements. These financial statements are presented in accordance with Statement of Financial&#13;
Accounting Standards No. 117, Financial Statements of Not-For-Profit-Organizations (SFAS No. 117).&#13;
SFAS No. 117 requires that net assets are classified in accordance with donor restrictions; however,&#13;
the Centre has no net assets as of June 30, 2009 and June 2008.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP and&#13;
IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of&#13;
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, together with the related disclosures as at the date of the&#13;
financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Management estimates the amount of unbilled expenses incurred by arbitrators, and related&#13;
revenues, for ongoing cases at each year end. The nature of arbitration/conciliation cases handled&#13;
by the Centre requires the use of external arbitrators, who charge fees for their service based on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

time spent on the cases. The estimation process uses information received from the arbitrators&#13;
about unbilled time spent on the cases through to the end of the fiscal year. In some cases the&#13;
determination of arbitrators' fees and expenses incurred for ongoing cases is based on estimated time&#13;
spent by the arbitrators in relation to the progress of the case and the number of proceedings through&#13;
to the end of the year. Actual results of arbitrator fees earned but unbilled, and arbitration/&#13;
conciliation case expenses incurred as at year end may differ materially from management's estimates.&#13;

&#13;
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash held in a bank account.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Share of the Cash and Investments in the Pool: The Centre's share in the cash and investments in&#13;
the Pool is reported at fair value. Resulting gains and losses are reported as investment income due&#13;
to parties to arbitration/conciliation proceedings in statements of financial position.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Due from Parties to the Arbitration/Conciliation Proceedings: Direct expenses incurred by&#13;
arbitrators in excess of advance payments made by the parties to the ongoing arbitration/conciliation&#13;
proceedings are recognized as due from parties to arbitration/conciliation proceedings and are&#13;
callable in accordance with the Centre's Regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other Assets and Amortization: The Centre's other assets comprise of software and web site&#13;
development costs which are capitalized at cost and amortized over four years using the straight line&#13;
method. Amortization is charged from commencement of the use of the software.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Centre evaluates the carrying value of software and web site annually, and whenever events or&#13;
changes in circumstances indicate impairment has occurred. Impairment is considered to have&#13;
occurred if the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, at which time, a write-down would&#13;
be recorded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Revenue Recognition from Arbitration/Conciliation Proceedings: The Centre's direct expenses&#13;
attributable to arbitration/conciliation proceedings are borne by the parties in accordance with the&#13;
Centre's Administrative and Financial Regulations (Regulations). These direct expenses are funded&#13;
by advances from parties and include fees and travel expenses of arbitrators and the costs associated&#13;
with engaging meeting rooms and supporting services for conducting proceedings. In accordance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
76    |    ICSID&#13;
&amp;#12;with these Regulations, the Centre's Secretary-General calls on the parties to make advance deposits&#13;
with the Centre from time to time to defray these anticipated expenses. Accordingly, the Centre&#13;
recognizes revenues from these transactions during the period and to the extent expenses are incurred&#13;
related to arbitration/conciliation proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Administration fee Revenue: The Centre charges and collects from the advance deposits made by&#13;
the parties to arbitration/conciliation proceedings an annual administration fee based upon the&#13;
anniversary date of the constitution of the arbitration/conciliation proceedings. The revenues are&#13;
recognized on a straight-line basis, over the twelve month period in which service is performed.&#13;
The unearned revenue at the year end is deferred and recognized in the subsequent fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Investment of Undisbursed Advances from Parties and Refund of Surplus to the Parties: Investment&#13;
income earned on funds advanced from parties can be used for expenses related to arbitration/&#13;
conciliation proceedings. After the completion of an arbitration/conciliation proceeding, any excess&#13;
of advances and investment income over expenditures for the proceedings is refunded to the parties&#13;
in proportion to the amounts advanced by each party to the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Value of Services Provided by the Bank and In-Kind Contributions: In accordance with Statement&#13;
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 116, Accounting for Contributions Received and Contributions&#13;
Made, the value of services provided by the Bank is determined by the estimated fair value of these&#13;
services, net of the Centre's reimbursements to the Bank, and is recorded by the Centre as in-kind&#13;
contributions and also as expenses of the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank provides support services and facilities to the Centre including the following:&#13;
  (1) the services of staff members and consultants; and&#13;

NOTES TO fINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
July 1, 2008, ICSID adopted FAS 157. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework&#13;
for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to&#13;
measure fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. FAS 157&#13;
also requires that the valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of&#13;
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Note 7 provides further details on&#13;
fair value measurement of the Pool pursuant to FAS 157, which has been applied for the Pool from&#13;
July 1, 2008.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial&#13;
Assets and Financial Liabilities (FAS 159) also became effective for financial statements issued for&#13;
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 159 provides an option for most financial&#13;
assets and financial liabilities to be reported at fair value with changes in fair value reported in&#13;
earnings. ICSID has not elected to apply FAS 159 to any of its financial assets or financial liabilities&#13;
and accordingly, FAS 159 has no impact on ICSID's financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB): In March 2009, IASB issued amendments&#13;
to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures- Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments, for&#13;
implementation for annual period beginning on or after January 1, 2009.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The amendments expand disclosures required in respect of fair value measurements recognized in the&#13;
statements of financial position. For the purpose of the expanded disclosure a three level fair value&#13;
hierarchy has been introduced, similar to the hierarchy set out in Statement of Financial Accounting&#13;
Standards (FAS) No. 157 Fair Value Measurement described above. ICSID has adopted these&#13;
amendments in these financial statements. As explained above, Note 7 provides further details&#13;
on fair value measurement of the Pool.&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 3 -- SHARE Of CASH AND INVESTMENT IN THE POOL&#13;
Amounts paid to the Centre, but not yet disbursed, are managed by the Bank, which maintains a&#13;
single investment portfolio (the Pool) for all of the trust funds administered by the Bank, the&#13;
International Development Association, the International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral&#13;
Investment Guarantee Agency, and the funds of the Centre. The Bank maintains the Pool's assets&#13;
separate and apart from the funds of the World Bank Group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
78     |   ICSID&#13;
&amp;#12;The Pool is divided into sub-portfolios to which allocations are made based on fund specific&#13;
investment horizons, risk tolerances and/or other eligibility requirements for trust funds with&#13;
common characteristics as determined by IBRD as Administrator. Generally, the Pool is invested&#13;
in liquid financial instruments such as money market instruments, government and agency&#13;
obligations, mortgage-backed securities and other high-grade bonds. The Pool may also include&#13;
securities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements with other counterparties and&#13;
receivables from resale agreements for which it has accepted collateral. Additionally, the Pool also&#13;
includes derivative contracts such as currency forward contracts, plain vanilla swaps and callable&#13;
swaps linked to interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity indices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Centre's funds are invested in a sub-portfolio of the Pool which invests solely in cash and money&#13;
market instruments with terms of three months or less.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Share in pooled cash and investments represents the Centre's allocated share of the Pool's fair value&#13;
at the end of the reporting period. Net investment income consists of the Centre's allocated share of:&#13;
interest income earned by the Pool and, realized gains/losses from sales of securities and unrealized&#13;
gains/losses resulting from recording the assets held by the Pool at fair value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

NOTE 4 -- OTHER ASSETS&#13;
Other assets comprise computer software and web site development costs. The unamortized costs&#13;
were $326,512 at June 30, 2009 (2008: $88,320). Amortization charges amounted to $34,960 for&#13;
the year ended June 30, 2009 (2008: Nil) and are reflected in the Statements of Activities.&#13;

During the year ended June 30, 2008, the Bank agreed to lend up to $917,000 to the Centre,&#13;
to enable the Centre to acquire software and develop an information system. The loan is to be&#13;
drawn down by the Centre over a period of up to two years, bears no interest, and is repayable in&#13;
full within four years upon completion of the development of the information system. As at&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 6 -- RISK ARISINg fROM fINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS&#13;
The majority of the Centre's assets consist of its share in the Pool. The Pool is actively managed&#13;
and invested in accordance with the investment strategy established for all trust funds administered&#13;
by the World Bank Group. The objectives of the investment strategy are foremost to maintain&#13;
adequate liquidity to meet foreseeable cash flow needs and preserve capital and then to maximize&#13;
investment returns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Centre is exposed to credit and liquidity risks. The risk management policies employed to&#13;
manage these risks are discussed below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Credit risk -- The risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and&#13;
cause the other party to incur a financial loss. Of the Centre's assets, other assets are not subject to&#13;
credit risk. Therefore, the Centre's maximum credit exposure at June 30, 2009 is equivalent to the&#13;
gross value of the remaining assets amounting to $20,370,433 (2008: $16,986,216).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank invests the Centre's share in Pooled Investments in money market deposits. The Bank's&#13;
policy is to only invest in money market deposits issued or guaranteed by financial institutions&#13;
whose senior debt securities are rated at least A-. At the reporting date, approximately 100% of&#13;
the Centre's share of the investment portfolio is held in securities rated at least A and 54% is held&#13;
in securities rated at least AA- (2008: 92%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank defines the concentration of credit risk as the extent to which the Pooled Investments&#13;
are held by an individual counterparty. The concentration of credit risk with respect to the Pool&#13;
of investments is mitigated because the Bank has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure&#13;
to any individual issuer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other receivables and amounts due from parties to arbitration/conciliation proceedings result from&#13;
the ordinary course of business. The amounts are neither past due or impaired.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Liquidity risk -- The risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in raising liquid funds to meet its&#13;
commitments. ICSID regulations require parties to disputes to make advance deposits with the&#13;
Centre to meet anticipated expenses of arbitration/conciliation proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;NOTE 7 -- fAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT&#13;
Effective July 1, 2008, FAS 157 was applied to the cash and investments held in the Pool.&#13;
As discussed in Notes (2) and (3), the cash and investments of all trust funds administered by the&#13;
World Bank Group are managed in a pooled investment portfolio, as such all investment decisions&#13;
are made and consequences monitored at the Pool level. The ensuing disclosure on fair value&#13;
measurement and fair value hierarchy is therefore at the Pool level pursuant to FAS 157, followed&#13;
by the fair value amount of the Centre's share in the pooled cash and investments at the end of the&#13;
reporting period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157)&#13;
IBRD has an established and documented process for determining fair values of the Pool. Fair&#13;
value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. Financial instruments for which quoted&#13;
market prices are not readily available are valued based on discounted cash flow models. These&#13;
models primarily use market-based or independently-sourced market parameters such as yield&#13;
curves, interest rates, volatilities, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Summarized below are the techniques applied in determining the fair values of financial instruments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Investment Securities&#13;
Where available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of trading securities.&#13;
Examples include some government securities, mutual funds, futures and exchange-traded equity&#13;
securities. For instruments for which market quotations are not available, fair values are&#13;
determined using model-based valuation techniques, whether internally-generated or vendor-&#13;
supplied, that include the standard discounted cash flow method using market observable inputs&#13;
such as yield curves, credit spreads and prepayment speeds. Unless quoted prices are available,&#13;
money market instruments are reported at face value, which approximates fair value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Securities Purchased under Resale Agreements and Securities Sold under Agreements toRepurchase&#13;
Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are&#13;
reported at face value which approximates fair value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        ANNUAL REPORT 2009                   |   81&#13;
&amp;#12;ANNEX 6 (CONTINUED)&#13;
NOTES TO fINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Derivative Contracts&#13;
Derivative contracts include currency forward contracts, plain vanilla swaps and callable swaps linked&#13;
to interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity indices. Derivatives are valued using the standard&#13;
discounted cash flow methods using market observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange&#13;
rates, or basis spreads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Fair Value Hierarchy&#13;
FAS 157 establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy under which financial instruments are&#13;
categorized based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy&#13;
gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level&#13;
1), the next highest priority to observable market-based inputs or inputs that are corroborated by&#13;
market data (Level 2) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by&#13;
market data (Level 3). When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of&#13;
the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the&#13;
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety.&#13;
Thus, a Level 3 fair value measurement of the instrument may include inputs that are observable&#13;
(Level 2) and unobservable (Level 3). Additionally, FAS 157 requires that the valuation techniques&#13;
used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of&#13;
unobservable inputs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial instruments representing the Pool investments recorded at fair value are categorized based&#13;
on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Level 1: Financial instruments whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical&#13;
         instruments in active markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Level 2: Financial instruments whose values are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in&#13;
         active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not&#13;
         active; or pricing models for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or&#13;
         indirectly for substantially the full term of the instrument.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Level 3: Financial instruments whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require&#13;
         inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
As noted above, financial instruments in the Pool categorized as Level 3 represents less than 1% of&#13;
the total Pool fair value at June 30, 2009 and is deemed immaterial. As such, no additional disclosure&#13;
relating to (i) the changes in the fair value of the Pool's Level 3 financial instruments from July 1,&#13;
2008 to June 30, 2009, and (ii) the portion of gains or losses included in the Excess of receipts over&#13;
disbursements line item for the period from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009 attributable to the&#13;
unrealized gains and losses on the Pool's Level 3 financial instruments still held at June 30, 2009, and&#13;
where the amounts are included in the Statement of Financial Position has been presented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As of June 30, 2009, the Pool does not have any financial instruments measured at fair value on a&#13;
non-recurring basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Centre's Share of the Cash and Investments in the Pool&#13;
The Centre's share of the cash and investments in the Pool, which was allocated based on the specific&#13;
investment horizons, risk tolerances and other eligibility requirements pursuant to the Agreements,&#13;
has a fair value of $18,403,875 as of June 30, 2009.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Centre's share of the cash and investments in the Pool is not traded in any market; however, the&#13;
underlying assets within the Pool are traded in the market and are reported at fair value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
All other financial assets and financial liabilities are carried at cost. Their carrying value is considered to&#13;
be a reasonable estimate of fair value because none of the instruments are considered to be impaired.&#13;

                                           Independent Auditors' Report&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To: International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes&#13;
&#13;
We have audited the accompanying statement of financial position of the International Centre for&#13;
Settlement of Investment Disputes ("the Centre") as of June 30, 2009, and the related statements of&#13;
activities and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended ("the 2009 financial statements"). These financial&#13;
statements are the responsibility of the management of the Centre. Our responsibility is to express an&#13;
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The accompanying financial statements of the&#13;
Centre as of June 30, 2008 and for the fiscal year then ended, were audited by other auditors whose report,&#13;
dated September 30, 2008, on those statements was unqualified and included an explanatory paragraph that&#13;
described the restatement of the Centre's financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2007, as&#13;
discussed in Note 8 to the 2008 financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of&#13;
America and International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the&#13;
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material&#13;
misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for&#13;
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing&#13;
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Centre's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we&#13;
express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the&#13;
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and&#13;
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement&#13;
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion, the 2009 financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the&#13;
financial position of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes as of June 30, 2009,&#13;
and the change in its net assets and its cash flows for the fiscal year then ended in conformity with U.S.&#13;
generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the&#13;
International Accounting Standards Board.&#13;

            ICSID annual report 2009
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This is the annual report on the
            operation of the International Centre for Settlement of
            Investment Disputes (ICSID) required by Article 6(1) (g) of
            the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
            between States and Nationals of Other States. This annual
            report covers the fiscal year July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009.
            With respect to membership, the Republic of Kosovo signed
            the ICSID Convention and deposited its Instrument of
            Acceptance with the World Bank in late FY2009. ICSID
            contracting states continue to conclude bilateral investment
            treaties (BITs) between themselves and with non-contracting
            states. The vast majority of these treaties provide for the
            submission of disputes to arbitration or conciliation under
            the ICSID convention or the additional facility. In fact,
            BITs provided the basis for ICSID jurisdiction in 20 of the
            24 cases registered during the fiscal year, and the
            proliferation of BITs has resulted in ICSID's sizeable
            current caseload.
