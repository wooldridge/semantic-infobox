ISLAMIC FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF THE COMOROS&#13;
PILOT AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    The Government of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros (GOC) has requested&#13;
IDA's assistance to help restore agricultural growth. The Government recognizes that a long&#13;
term commitment is needed to achieve this goal and that innovative approaches must be sought&#13;
to address the most binding constraints it faces with regard to agricultural development. This&#13;
Pilot Project is proposed to support the first steps in this long-term process that is being&#13;
embarked upon by Government. It will both seek to address the core constraints to agricultural&#13;
development while serving as a vehicle for developing and testing innovative but viable&#13;
solutions that could be adopted on a broader scale during a second phase. The total cost of the&#13;
proposed Pilot Agricultural Services Project is estimated at about US$2.8 million equivalent, net&#13;
of taxes and duties, with a foreign exchange content of US$1.4 million. IDA will finance&#13;
US$1.6 million of total project costs, while IFAD and the GOC will contribute US$1.0 million&#13;
and US$0.2 million respectively.&#13;
1.2    The project is derived from the GOC's Agricultural Sector Strategy ratified by the&#13;
country's Federal Assembly in June 1994. A significant basis for the project comes from the&#13;
results of a broad-based systematic consultation carried out with farmers, agricultural&#13;
professionals and Government officials in the first half of 1995 during the preparation phase.&#13;
A.    BACKGROUND AND ECONOMIC SETTING&#13;
1.3    General Background. The Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros is an Indian Ocean&#13;
archipelago, inhabited by a largely homogeneous Islamic population of about 498,000 and a&#13;
GNP per capita of US$ 490 in 1995. The economy is predominantly rural, and highly dependent&#13;
on external assistance which averaged about US$118 per capita per annum over 1989-95.&#13;
Agriculture accounts for 40 percent of GDP and provides the livelihood of 70-80 percent of the&#13;
people and about 50 percent of total export earnings, with activities concentrated on the&#13;
production of food crops as well as the three main export commodities (vanilla, cloves and&#13;
perfiune essence). Services, mostly commerce and public administration, contribute about 49&#13;
percent of GDP, while construction and manufacturing represent around 11 percent. The&#13;
industrial sector is limited to the processing of export crops and a few consumer goods supplying&#13;
the domestic market. Tourism has started to develop, and shows promising growth potential.&#13;
1.4    The Comoros' social standards compare favorably with the average for sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa. Life expectancy at birth is 54 years and the infant mortality rate is 95 per thousand.&#13;
Between 1975 and 1995, primary school enrollment increased from 46 percent to 75 percent of&#13;
the school-age group. However, high population growth averaging about 2.7 percent a year has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
put increasing pressure on basic social services, land use and the fragile ecosystem. Of the&#13;
islands in the archipelago, Anjouan with a population of 496 inhabitants per square kilometer is&#13;
the most densely populated. Grande Comore, the largest island, has a population density of&#13;
253/sq. km. and Moheli, the smallest one, has 128 inhabitants/sq. km.&#13;
1.5    Economic Setting.  Since independence in 1975 the country has experienced&#13;
considerable economic change in trying to adjust its economy to the external environment.&#13;
Following a decade of growth bubble generated by externally-financed infrastructure projects,&#13;
real GDP slowed significantly from an annual average of 6 percent in the early 1980s to 0.6&#13;
percent over 1985-95. This led to a decline in real per capita income by an annual average of&#13;
about 2 percent during the past decade, and the emergence of chronic financial problems in the&#13;
late 1980s.  The decline in economic performance is a manifestation of the country's&#13;
developmental constraints, which include a narrow export base, weak institutional capacity&#13;
exacerbated by poor economic management, as well as an unfavorable private sector&#13;
environment. To address its macroeconomic imbalances and remove some of the structural&#13;
constraints to growth, the government launched an adjustment program in 1991.&#13;
1.6    The Adjustment Program. The adjustment program made considerable progress in&#13;
liberalizing imports and removing price controls on several commodities. It also improved the&#13;
environment for private sector activity and made some progress in reducing the fiscal burden&#13;
arising from the parastatal sector. These led to major improvements in budgetary as well as&#13;
external current account deficits in 1992-93. During that period, there was also a strong&#13;
economic recovery, accounted for mainly by the improved performance of agriculture and&#13;
manufacturing.&#13;
1.7   In January 1994, the Comorian Franc was devalued by 33 percent in foreign currency, in&#13;
concert with the 50 percent devaluation that was effected by other CFA countries. The&#13;
economy's response to this devaluation was mixed. Slow down of economic activities in trade&#13;
and agriculture was responsible for a real GDP decline averaging 2.3 percent a year in 1994-95.&#13;
Tourism growth had some compensatory effect in 1994, with tourist arrivals registering a 20&#13;
percent increase, but this was dampened by the coup in September 1995. Exports performance&#13;
for traditional commodities was poor because of the depressed market of vanilla and cloves&#13;
(resulting in a price collapse), even though new export products, such as new varieties of&#13;
perfume essence and extracts, were starting to develop. With major shortfalls in revenues and an&#13;
increase in current expenditures, the country's fiscal performance in 1994 and 1995 was weak.&#13;
By end 1995, salary arrears for civil servants accumulated up to six months and external arrears&#13;
reached $40 million. The inflation rate rose by some 20 percent in 1994 but stabilized at about 7&#13;
percent in 1995. In 1996, real GDP is expected to grow by about 2 percent as tourism has picked&#13;
up and the private sector has started to regain confidence after the March elections. The rate of&#13;
inflation is estimated to drop to 5 percent as prices have stabilized. However, public finances&#13;
seem to remain difficult.&#13;
1.8   Economic reformns in Comoros have been complicated by the parallel efforts at&#13;
introducing political reforms.  The country's political landscape has been historically&#13;
characterized by turbulence associated with attempts to reconcile modern governance with&#13;
ancestral traditions. The latest phase of political change was initiated in 1990 with reforms aimed&#13;
at bringing the country from one party rule to representative government. A multiparty&#13;
Constitution was approved by referendum in June 1992. Since that time, however, the political&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
situation has remained fragile, given the recent history of frequent changes in government and&#13;
several coup attempts, the latest of which was in September 1995.&#13;
1.9    Presidential elections held in March 1996 represent a major landmark in the country's&#13;
political transition process, and it is anticipated that this will usher in a period of stability. The&#13;
prospects for 1996 are more positive and optimistic, with the economy expected to recover&#13;
mildly by about 2 percent as the private sector starts to regain confidence after the March&#13;
elections. New private investments are forthcoming in the hotel expansion, fishing and small&#13;
manufacturing activities (soft drink). The new government has recognized the need for the&#13;
country to improve its economic management and performance, and has started to take measures&#13;
to improve budgetary revenues and cut expenditures, as well as create a more conducive&#13;
environment for private sector investment through adoption of a comprehensive privatization&#13;
program  for the public enterprises. The devaluation of January 1994 has brought some&#13;
improvement in the country's competitiveness, and continued membership of the Comoros in the&#13;
Franc zone will provide a degree of stability based on prudent monetary policy. However,&#13;
internal adjustment needs to be continued through compression of public expenditure and of the&#13;
real cost of services and labor. The deepening of tax reforms is also needed to remove tax-&#13;
induced distortions and strengthen government revenue base. The new government is preparing&#13;
a second adjustment program to support these reforms as well as consolidate the gains from the&#13;
earlier adjustment efforts and has requested support from the Bank and the IMF. A Structural&#13;
Adjustment Credit and an IMF ESAF are being prepared for Board consideration in the first half&#13;
of FY98.&#13;
B.    SECTORAL ASPECTS&#13;
1.10   The Agricultural Sector. Because of its predominance in the economy, the agricultural&#13;
sector will likely remain the foundation of the Comoros' growth in the foreseeable future.&#13;
Furthermore, the country possessed an unrealized potential for further growth. In addition to a&#13;
favorable climate and known capacity to produce a variety of crops, the densely-concentrated&#13;
patterns of rural population favor group and association development. The country's economic&#13;
regime is amenable to the development of a market economy, despite its frailties; and there is a&#13;
reservoir of underutilized technical knowledge and experience, within and outside the civil&#13;
service, waiting to be tapped.&#13;
1.11   Policy FrameworkL The utilization of Comoros agricultural potential has been stifled by&#13;
several policy, structural and institutional factors. On the policy front, distortions, including&#13;
unfavorable fiscal/tariff regimes (i.e. high import duties on inputs, taxes on inter-island trade),&#13;
and a currency regime that favored imports, resulted in a negative incentive structure for the&#13;
agricultural sector. Although most of these distortions have been or are in the process of being&#13;
corrected through the adjustment program which, for the time being, constitutes the&#13;
Government's main instrument to address macro-economic issues, supply response has been&#13;
slow due to the persistence of structural and institutional constraints.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1.12   Structural and  Institutional Frameworl    A  key  constraint to  agricultural&#13;
development, militating against a substantive response to the 1994 devaluation, relates to the&#13;
inadequacy of the agricultural services delivery system. As corroborated by the results of&#13;
extensive consultations conducted in the course of project preparation, the current system of&#13;
extension as delivered by MPEPFE is unproven. The system is also unresponsive to beneficiary&#13;
concerns/needs.  As regards research, INRAPE, the agency charged with the country's&#13;
agricultural research, has only very limited capacity and lacks both human and material&#13;
resources. The only research activity carried in the recent past out has been through a small&#13;
French-financed project, which has been able to study with good results the various farming&#13;
2&#13;
systems of the country . Some further support will be provided through projects currently&#13;
financed by the European Union .&#13;
1.13   The Ministry of Agricultural Production, Livestock, Fisheries, Forestry and&#13;
Environment (MPEPFE). The reorganization and downsizing of the MPEPFE in 1993 and&#13;
1994, which was part of the GOC's structural adjustment efforts, have not helped improve the&#13;
capacity of the Ministry, particularly in relation to its ability to plan, monitor and execute its&#13;
activities. The MPEPFE underwent a considerable reduction in its personnel from over 900 in&#13;
the 1980s to 133 positions at present, as part of the GOC's structural adjustment efforts. While&#13;
this reduction affected mostly staff under contract, it included some experienced staff in the&#13;
Ministry's central services who opted for early retirement. This resulted in the significant&#13;
weakening of the planning and monitoring capacity of MPEPFE, a function which will remain at&#13;
the core of the Government's newly defined mission with respect to the agricultural sector.&#13;
While the role of the private sector as investor is expected to increase over time, donor-financed&#13;
investments in agriculture are likely to remain important in the Comoros for the foreseeable&#13;
future, requiring institutional capacity for planning and monitoring the public expenditure&#13;
program in the sector. In addition, frequent changes at the ministerial and often senior levels at&#13;
the MPEPFE have seriously weakened the decision-making process at the Ministry and&#13;
contributed to the drop in confidence in the rural areas toward the Ministry staff in the field.&#13;
1.14   Other agricultural development constraints include the prevalence of complex land&#13;
tenure arrangements, ill-suited in the current socio-economic context, insufficient rural financing&#13;
services, and inadequate infrastructure in the more remote areas. The problems associated with&#13;
the land tenure system are diverse and stem in part from the co-existence of three legal systems&#13;
(traditional, Islamic and colonial) and a variety of traditions affecting the inheritance of land.&#13;
The situation is further complicated by: (a) the lack of specialized facilities or institutions to&#13;
handle land tenure issues and formulate policy; (b) the lack of an operationally simple land&#13;
titling or registration system; (c) the absence of formal leasing agreements between landlords&#13;
and tenants; and (d) a demonstrated difficulty in enforcing property rights against illegal&#13;
occupation of land (squatters). As part of its 1994 agricultural strategy, the Government has&#13;
identified a number of measures to create a modern land tenure regime for the country, including&#13;
the establishment of a new institutional framework. In addition, the Government, as part of its&#13;
overall adjustment strategy, has established a Law Reforn Commission4 to review all existing&#13;
2   The information collected, combined with that of the BDPA's sector work of 1991 and the diagnostic&#13;
survey of 1995 (Cf. Supplementary Annex 2 to the Staff Appraisal Report), provided the key data for&#13;
this project's economic analysis.&#13;

statutes, including those pertaining to ownership of land. This task is on-going and there is a&#13;
strong likelihood that, in the near future, work will be needed to ensure consistency between the&#13;
institutional framework proposed as part of the agricultural strategy and the conclusions of the&#13;
Law Review Commission.&#13;
1.15   On rural credit, the Comoros do not have a formal rural finance institution and a specific&#13;
policy and legislation governing rural finance. Although rural credit facilities are currently being&#13;
provided by two donor-assisted projects (the SANDUK project, financed by the CFD, and the&#13;
IFAD-financed Appui aux Initiatives economiques de base). The five savings and credit&#13;
facilities created during a recently completed FAO project are facing recovery delays and are not&#13;
likely to be sustainable.  The overall situation is characteristic of project-initiated credit&#13;
initiatives, reflecting the absence of specific policy and legislation governing rural finance&#13;
which leads to project designs that are contradictory and counterproductive. A national seminar,&#13;
to review the activities in the sub-sector, was held in early 1996, the recommendations from&#13;
which are expected to form the basis for needed policies and strategy.&#13;
1.16   To adequately respond to the challenges of agricultural development, the Government&#13;
has adopted an agricultural strategy in 1994, whose principal objectives are: (a) to enhance rural&#13;
incomes as a means of alleviating rural poverty and promoting food security; (b) to expand and&#13;
diversify agricultural exports as well as broaden outlets for domestically-produced, non-traded&#13;
food products; (c) to promote a self-sustainable, private-sector led agricultural development; and&#13;
(d) to facilitate the viable and environmentally-sustainable utilization of natural resources. In the&#13;
work leading to the formulation of its agricultural strategy, the Government has recognized the&#13;
ineffectiveness of the dirigiste or top-down approach which characterized, up to recently, the&#13;
relationship between the field staff and farmers . As a result, the decision has been made to&#13;
adopt a more interactive, or participatory approach, in dealing with the farm population. This&#13;
implies that, henceforth, active and constant consultation and exchanges will take place between&#13;
the administration and its agents and the rural population, in order to define, formulate and&#13;
implement developmental actions.&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    PROJECT RATIONALE, OBJECTIVES AND DEscRIpTIoN&#13;
1.    Project Rationale&#13;
2.1    The achievement of the Government's objectives for its agricultural sector requires (a) a&#13;
long-term commitment and engagement to addressing the country's most binding constraints to&#13;
agricultural productivity, while (b) seeking innovative approaches that stimulate private sector&#13;
This situation was further confinned in the course of the surveys carried out in the proposed Pilot&#13;
Project's preparation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
involvement in the delivery of agricultural services to benefit small-scale farmers. To achieve&#13;
these objectives, Government is continuing to intensify efforts geared towards restoring&#13;
competitiveness of the agricultural sector (and of other productive sectors) through deepening&#13;
and consolidation of economic reforms supported by the adjustment program. The government&#13;
has also pledged to build a cost-effective agricultural service delivery system as well as&#13;
strengthen its institutional capacity for sector planning and monitoring.  To support the&#13;
improvement of the legal framework, the government has established a Law Reform&#13;
Commission to review, inter alia, existing statutes pertaining to ownership of land. A national&#13;
seminar on rural finance was also held early in 1996 to obtain a better appreciation of the issues&#13;
in this domain. The proposed Pilot Agricultural Services Project, is aimed at supporting&#13;
Government's efforts towards refining, fine-tuning and implementing certain aspects of its&#13;
agricultural development strategy.&#13;
2.     Project Objectives&#13;
2.2    The specific objectives of the project will be twofold:&#13;
(a) to produce through actual testing on the ground, replicable service systema that, if&#13;
successful, could be established nation-wide, with full collaboration from the Government's&#13;
partners in the donor community. The service systems to be tested include (i) a participation-&#13;
based and results-oriented extension service, operable by either the private or public sector; and&#13;
(ii) the use of private sector associations and the media to collect and relay market- and farm-&#13;
related information, the cost of which could eventually be covered through advertising (of which&#13;
there is still very little over the country's few communications media).&#13;
(b) to support the strengthening of the country's capacity to implement its agricultural&#13;
strategy through (i) the re-orienting and re-focusing of INRAPE's role as a collector and&#13;
provider of technical information to extension agents and end-users, and a coordinator and&#13;
provider of training services in the sector; and (ii) the improvement of MPEPFE's capacity for&#13;
sector planning, monitoring and coordination, as well as (iii) the formulation of sub-sectoral&#13;
policies and strategies to ameliorate rural finance and land tenure inadequacies.&#13;
3.     Project Description&#13;
2.3    The proposed Pilot Project, to be implemented over a three-year period, will focus on&#13;
improving agricultural services and strengthening institutional capacity in planning and&#13;
monitoring the activities in the sector.&#13;
2.4    Agricultural services (US$1.3 million). The principal constraints to be addressed under&#13;
this component will be the difficulties farmers experience in accessing relevant and timely&#13;
information about crop-related technology, soil conservation and markets and in using it to their&#13;
advantage.  Based on the stated preferences of farmers, the project will (i) mainstream&#13;
participation and client consultation in the delivery of efficient and cost-effective agricultural&#13;
services; within this context, it will (ii) test the performance and effectiveness of private&#13;
extension contractors working directly with farmers, against the existing public sector services;&#13;
(iii) re-orient the country's "research" facility towards the collection, evaluation and propagation&#13;
of technological information and making this information more easily accessible to all users; and&#13;
(iv) support the development of groups and associations and enhance communications through&#13;
national media on agriculture techniques and market related issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
2.5    Planning and Monitoring Support (US$0.3 million). The constraints to be addressed&#13;
through this component will include: the weaknesses of the MPEPFE in the areas of planning,&#13;
monitoring, sectoral policy formulation and general internal management. Planning and&#13;
monitoring remain at the core of the Government's newly defined mission with respect to the&#13;
agricultural sector. The government will continue to play a significant role in the preparation of&#13;
the public expenditure program and coordination of investments in the agriculture sector,&#13;
particularly those financed by external assistance. The quality and impact of these will depend&#13;
largely on planning and monitoring skills within the Ministry. The project will, therefore, focus&#13;
its activities in strengthening these skills and support the preparation of a suitable follow-on&#13;
operation to the pilot, if warranted. In addition, it will also support studies and reflections aimed&#13;
at reformulating rural credit and land tenure policies.&#13;
4.     Detailed Features6&#13;
2.6    Agricultural Services. This component will include: (a) testing private sector delivery&#13;
of extension services; (b) converting the country's research establishment into a&#13;
depository/clearing house of agricultural technical information adapted to Comorian conditions;&#13;
and (c) improving access to information through training, through the media and support to&#13;
existing farmer organizations.&#13;
2.7    Agricultural Extension. The objective of this sub-component will be to test the delivery&#13;
of extension advice to farmers through private contractors (NGOs, individuals, groups,&#13;
specialized firms, etc.) selected by tender and operating under fixed-term contracts. The test will&#13;
be based on the comparative evaluation, carried out by independent local consultants, of the&#13;
performance of private contractors delivering extension services against that of existing public&#13;
sector extension workers operating in separate villages. Selection of extension contractors and&#13;
monitoring consultants, and review of the performance evaluation will be done jointly by the&#13;
Government and Project Village Committees (PVC - para 3.4) representing the serviced farmers;&#13;
similar committees will be established in the villages covered by the public sector workers. The&#13;
appraisal mission has ascertained that there are qualified private sector individuals who will bid&#13;
for this contract.&#13;
2.8    The project will finance the material investment costs and recurrent expenditures&#13;
connected with the pilot extension activities. The fees of the private contractors selected on the&#13;
basis of competitive bidding will be financed by the project. The salaries of the public sector&#13;
workers will continue to be paid out of MPEPFE's budget. Equivalent operating resources and&#13;
facilities will be given to both groups. Cost estimates of the private contractors have been&#13;
calculated on the basis of three teams totaling eight individuals operating over an area covering a&#13;
total of 12 or 13 villages. The public sector teams will involve a similar number of staff and&#13;
villages. The financial provision for this activity will include contractual fees for the extension&#13;
contractors, transport, office support and training for both private contractors and public sector&#13;
workers. Resources will also be provided for vehicles and related operating costs for monitoring&#13;
activities.&#13;
6   Implementation arrangements are given in Chapter 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
2.9    Technical support on agriculture related issues and message content, as well as training,&#13;
will be provided by INRAPE to both private and public sector workers. Extension messages will&#13;
initially focus on proven existing themes, including soil conservation, fertility restoration, plant&#13;
protection, mixed farming8, establishment of live hedges9 and agro-forestry, as well as the&#13;
marketing of produce. Fertilizers and other inputs are discussed in para 5.2 . Criteria on which&#13;
to measure the performance of the extension workers will be based on the numbers of farmers&#13;
participating and adopting recommended themes, on actual production data, intended for both&#13;
consumption and market, on yield and income improvements, on utilization of inputs, etc. Data&#13;
will be collected systematically by the independent monitoring team. The concept of two&#13;
extension systems (public sector vs private sector) competing for "survival" should provide a&#13;
dynamic environment in which farmers will be the foremost beneficiaries. The experiment is not&#13;
intended to result in the elimination of the public sector extension service but to install an&#13;
efficient and cost effective service. Hence, the public sector extension workers will be retained&#13;
only in the areas where their performance is superior and also in areas not likely to be serviced&#13;
by the private sector.&#13;
2.10   Research.  To clarify INRAPE's role in the context of a significantly downsized&#13;
MPEPFE, a specialized agency 0 will be recruited to help the Institute develop a Master Plan&#13;
which will define its goals and appropriate organizational arrangements for the next five to ten&#13;
years. The plan will take into account the Government's constrained resources, the farmers'&#13;
expressed needs and the potential for the public extension service to be transferred to the private&#13;
sector. WNRAPE will continue to provide farmers (both directly and through extension) and&#13;
others with a ready access to agricultural information, especially concerning crops and other&#13;
products for which the Comoros has a comparative advantage. In this capacity, INRAPE will&#13;
collect, evaluate and re-package information in a usable form for extension agents, farmers and&#13;
other users undertaking: (a) the strengthening of its documentation center; (b) the repatriation of&#13;
information collected previously by foreign research institutes; (c) the production of technical&#13;
papers on all crops that can be grown in the country; (d) the creation of a digest of all research&#13;
findings; and (e) the production of an extension manual intended for both farmers and extension&#13;
agents. The project will finance the above activities and help establish scientific relationships&#13;
with other countries of the Indian Ocean region. It will also strengthen INRAPE's capacity to&#13;
provide training both to its staff and to others. In response to a specific request by MPEPFE at&#13;
appraisal, the project will finance crop protection activities, conducted by INRAPE, aimed, inter&#13;
alia, at combating leaf spot (cercospora cajani), a widespread disease in the Comoros affecting&#13;
both banana and pigeon pea stands.&#13;
2.11   Communications and Markets.  This sub-component will help finance training in&#13;
participatory approach techniques of members of groups and associations, extension contractors&#13;
and public sector agricultural staff. An external consultant will be recruited to finish the&#13;
training, started at preparation, of a pool of MPEPFE staff who in turn will train other nationals&#13;
in these techniques. The project will support the development of local capacity for gathering and&#13;
analyzing market information and disseminating it to farmers and others through the national&#13;
8   Association agriculture-elevage.&#13;
9   Embocagement.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
media. This experiment will be undertaken under contract between the MPEPFE and the&#13;
agricultural section of the Chamber of Commerce for Industry and Agriculture, which will&#13;
coordinate the activity. Data will be collected through the small but dynamic National Farmers'&#13;
Union (SNAC) and analyzed and prepared for broadcasting by the Chamber of Commerce with&#13;
the support of a local firm specialized in the preparation of radio programs. The project will&#13;
finance: (a) training in the collection, analysis and preparation of data for market reports; (b)&#13;
organization of information gathering; (c) support to media production groups for preparing&#13;
market information programs; and (d) monitoring of results (through a private facility as for the&#13;
extension experiment). The possibility of generating advertising revenues from farm broadcasts&#13;
will be investigated by the monitoring consultants working in collaboration with the participants&#13;
in this experiment.&#13;
2.12   Planning and Monitoring Support. This component will strengthen the MPEPFE's&#13;
capacity to: (i) implement the 1994 agriculture strategy and prepare the public expenditure&#13;
programs in the agriculture sector as well as sector development plans for each of the islands of&#13;
the archipelago; (ii) coordinate, monitor and evaluate implementation of sector projects and&#13;
activities; and (iii) carry out sector-wide studies. To that end, the project will support the&#13;
Planning Division operating under the Secretary-General, the Ministry's coordinating authority,&#13;
providing for: computer and office equipment; training of Planning Division staff; and sector&#13;
specific studies, including project harmonization . The studies that the project will support will&#13;
include: (i) a rural finance study, drawing on the experience of ongoing activities and the&#13;
workshop held in the first half of 1996 (para 1.15), to formulate a nationwide policy for the sub-&#13;
sector as well as an action plan for reforms and integration into the national financial system; (ii)&#13;
a land tenure feasibility study to reconcile the conclusions of the Law Reform Commission and&#13;
the approaches formulated in the agricultural strategy; and (iii) a detailed agricultural baseline&#13;
study in the project areas to study agricultural productivity to determine, inter alia, the&#13;
implications, if any, on producer behavior of the country's current macro-economic (including&#13;
exchange rate) policies. The project will also finance office equipment and light vehicles to&#13;
replace the run-down equipment and transport at central regional headquarters of the Agriculture&#13;
Department of the Ministry; and operating resources for project-funded equipment.&#13;
B.    PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
2.13   Project Costs. The project will be implemented over a three year period. Total project&#13;
costs, net of taxes but including preparation costs, price and physical contingencies, are&#13;
estimated at US$2.8 million (FC 1009.1 million) of which 50 percent is estimated to be foreign&#13;
exchange costs. Base costs are estimated at US$2.6 million equivalent and contingencies&#13;
amount to US$0.24 million equivalent (9.4 percent of base costs). Project costs by component&#13;
are summarized in Table 2.1 below and detailed cost tables by year and by component are&#13;
provided in Annex 2 of this report and Annex I of the Supplementary Annexes. Unit costs are&#13;
based on early 1995 prices.&#13;

2.14   Financing. IDA will finance US$1.6 million or 57 percent of total costs estimated at&#13;
US$2.8 million. IFAD will contribute about US$1.0 million, or 36 percent, and the Government&#13;
about US$0.2 million, or 7 percent, toward project financing. The proposed IDA Credit will&#13;
finance 31 percent of investment costs, including civil works, equipment and vehicles, technical&#13;
assistance and training. The Credit will also fund the cost of 14 percent of incremental operating&#13;
expenses, not including salaries.&#13;
2.15   IFAD will provide US$1.0 million equivalent or 36 percent of investment costs,&#13;
including equipment, technical assistance, training and studies. IFAD will also finance the cost&#13;
of 10 percent of incremental operating expenses, not including salaries. IFAD funding will be&#13;
directed toward project activities that reflect most closely that institution's concern with the&#13;
creation of opportunities for the rural poor to participate in development. Thus IFAD's&#13;
participation will be earmarked to finance the following activities: (a) the extension sub-&#13;
component; (b) workshops for INRAPE staff to prepare the research master plan; (c) the&#13;
production of a manual for end users of agricultural technology; (d) training in the participatory&#13;
approach; (e) training of the staff of the national farmers' association; (f) the land tenure and&#13;
rural finance studies; and (g) training of Planning Division staff. In addition to its contribution&#13;
toward project financing, IFAD will finance, through a separate grant amounting to about&#13;
12&#13;
US$40,000, a project launching workshop to take place at the time its loan becomes effective&#13;
One of the conditions of effectiveness of the IDA Credit will be that all effectiveness&#13;
conditions of the IFAD loan, except that relating to the effectiveness of the IDA Credit, will&#13;
be fulfilled (para. 6.3)&#13;
2.16   The Government will contribute some US$0.2 million toward project costs or close to 7&#13;
percent of the total costs. Government funds will be used to meet local training costs and the&#13;
salaries of the project's coordination staff. The financing plan is presented in Table 2.2.&#13;
12 Neither the cost of this workshop nor the grant to finance it have been included in project costs and&#13;

2.17   Government Counterpart Funding. The Government's total counterpart contribution&#13;
of US$208,000 equivalent for the three years of the project will finance the cost of training&#13;
workshops (US$44,000) and of staff salaries and social charges of the coordination unit&#13;
(US$164,000)". The funding resources for these expenditures will come from MPEPFE's&#13;
investment budget. Existing MPEPFE staff from DGDR, INRAPE and the Planning Division&#13;
will be used for implementation, precluding the need for incremental salary costs in the&#13;
14&#13;
Ministry's recurrent budget . The total 1996 budget for the MPEPFE  amounts to US$7.9&#13;
million equivalent, representing US$7.1 million for investment expenditures and US$0.8 million&#13;
for recurrent expenditures. Nearly 90 percent of the investment budget (covering 13 projects) is&#13;
expected to be covered by external grants and loans.&#13;
2.18   The rate of project spending is expected to average US$0.7 million per year over the&#13;
project period. Some 90 percent of this amount will be covered by the IDA Credit and IFAD&#13;
Loan, leaving the remainder, or about US$70,000 per year, to be covered from MPEPFE's&#13;
investment budget (the amount represents about 1% of the current investment budget). This&#13;
would not appear to be an unbearable amount were it not for the Government's history of fiscal&#13;
shortfalls and its frequent inability to meet its obligations on time (e.g. debt service; civil servant&#13;
and teachers' salaries). Assurances were obtained at negotiations of the IDA Credit that the&#13;
Govemment had budgeted its contribution to the project in the 1997 investment budget.&#13;
2.19   Procurement.  The main project elements, their estimated costs and methods of&#13;
procurement are summarized in Table 2.3. The proposed timetable for the procurement of major&#13;
goods and services is included in Annex 3. Project procurement will be the responsibility of the&#13;
office of the project's national coordinator (para 3.1) which was ascertained at appraisal to have&#13;
the necessary knowledge and experience for the task.&#13;
13  See p. 8-1 of Annex 3 (Cost Tables). Staff include the Coordinator, one secretary, one accounts clerk&#13;
and 5 miscellanous support staff.&#13;
14  Private sector extension and other contract workers fnanced by the project will be included in the&#13;
MPEPFE's investment budget.&#13;

* Project period procurement only. Does not include project preparation procurement financed by PPF.&#13;
Numbers in bracket represent: (...) IDA funding; [...] IFAD joint fmnancing; {...} Govt. funding.&#13;
2.20    Goods and Works. (US$0.87 million). Goods, including vehicles, motorcycles, office&#13;
equipment and materials, amounting to about US$264,000, will be grouped into packages&#13;
costing more than US$50,000 equivalent and procured under ICB procedures, in accordance&#13;
with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995).&#13;
The same Guidelines will be applied for the procurement of Goods to be financed by IFAD&#13;
funds. Bidding documents for such contracts should be sent to IDA for prior review and non-&#13;
objection. Items, or groups of items, such as small furniture and field tools, estimated to cost less&#13;
than the equivalent of US$20,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of about US$54,000,&#13;
will be purchased on the basis of price quotations from at least three eligible suppliers in&#13;
accordance with local shopping procedures acceptable to IDA. Specialized equipment up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of about US$3,000 will be purchased on the basis of international shopping&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA. As far as possible, maintenance and operating materials under&#13;
"operating costs", will be procured also in accordance with national shopping procedures.&#13;
Procurement will be spread over the three years of the project. Details are included as Annex 1&#13;
in the Supplementary Annexes to this report. Minor civil works to rehabilitate the research&#13;
library, estimated to cost altogether $9,400, will be procured on the basis of price quotations&#13;
from local contractors in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
2.21    Consultant Services and Training (US$1.1 million). Short term consultants (including&#13;
auditors, extension contractors and external trainers) to be hired under the project will be&#13;
procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). The same Guidelines will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
be applied for the procurement of consultants to be financed by IFAD funds. No external long&#13;
term consultants are envisaged for financing under the Credit or the IFAD loan. A breakdown of&#13;
types and costs of technical assistance is at Annex 4 of this report.&#13;
2.22   Review of Procurement. Prior review by IDA will be carried out in accordance with&#13;
Appendix 1 of the Guidelines referred to in para 2.20. More specifically, goods contracts above&#13;
US$50,000 will be subject to IDA's prior review, which will cover about 80% of IDA financed&#13;
procurement. In the case of consultants, prior review by IDA will be required for all consultancy&#13;
contracts for individuals above US$20,000 and for firms above US$50,000. This exception will&#13;
not apply to terms of reference, single source contracts, assignments of a critical nature as&#13;
determined by IDA and to amendments of contracts raising the contract value for individuals to&#13;
US$20,000 and for firms to US$50,000 respectively. Prior IDA review will apply on: terms of&#13;
reference, short lists, letters of invitation with selection procedure, curriculum vitae, evaluation&#13;
reports, and contracts and letters of appointment of consultants. Standard bidding documents&#13;
modeled on the IDA's standard documents for procurement of civil works and goods are ready to&#13;
be used by the project. These documents will be incorporated in the implementation manual to&#13;
be completed by the MPEPFE prior to effectiveness (para 3.16) and will be reviewed in the&#13;
course of the project launching workshop to be held at the time of effectiveness (para 2.15).&#13;
2.23   Recording of Procurement Information. Procurement information will be collected and&#13;
recorded as follows:&#13;
(a) through the prompt reporting of contract information by MPEPFE;&#13;
(b) through the semi-annual reports to IDA and other donors (para 3.13), indicating: (i)&#13;
cost estimates for individual contracts and revised semi-annually for the project as a&#13;
whole, including best estimates of allowances for physical and price contingencies; (ii)&#13;
revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award,&#13;
and completion time for individual contracts; (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on&#13;
specified methods of procurement; and (iv) summary reports on the performance of&#13;
consultants;&#13;
(c) at the time of supervision missions, a detailed statement of all procurement&#13;
undertaken to date, together with a forecast of anticipated procurement to be undertaken&#13;
in the coming six months, with estimated costs; and&#13;
(d) as part of the government's completion report within six months of the project's&#13;
closing date (para 3.13).&#13;
2.24   Procurement Management. The project Coordinator (para 3.1) will be responsible for&#13;
preparing bidding documents and maintaining the deadlines for procurement actions agreed upon&#13;
in the procurement schedule. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the procurement&#13;
procedures and arrangements agreed at negotiations will be applied throughout the project.&#13;
Moreover, that all bid documents for the project's first year of implementation be prepared&#13;
to the satisfaction of IDA will be a condition of effectiveness (para. 6.3).&#13;
2.25   Disbursements. The IDA Credit is expected to be effective by December 30, 1996 and&#13;
will close by December 31, 2000 allowing for the three-year duration of the project plus a four-&#13;
month period for delayed disbursements beyond project completion date. Once agreement has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
been reached on the annual work program and budgets (para 3.12), withdrawals from the Credit&#13;
will be made using standard Bank procedures. To facilitate local disbursement, IDA will&#13;
advance the sum of KMF 40.000.000 into a special account with a commercial bank acceptable&#13;
to IDA. Expenditures should be grouped for replenishment of this special account and submitted&#13;
for reimbursement every month or more frequently, if necessary, through the standard channel of&#13;
the Ministry of Finance. The account may be used to pay for expenditures in either local&#13;
currency or foreign exchange through the commercial banking system, against any category of&#13;
expenditure. All expenditures less than 20 percent of the initial deposit will be paid from the&#13;
special account.  All replenishments should be fully documented except in cases where&#13;
Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) are authorized.&#13;
2.26   A project advance account in local currency, operated by the National Coordinator (para&#13;
3.1), will be established in a commercial bank, with an initial deposit of the equivalent of&#13;
US$17,500 to cover the Government's contribution to the first six months of project&#13;
15&#13;
expenditures . This advance account will be replenished from a deposit account opened at the&#13;
Central Bank to receive the Government's counterpart contribution. The advance account will&#13;
be replenished by the Government to an amount equivalent to the initial deposit every 6 months,&#13;
against presentation of supporting documentation, every six months or whenever the balance&#13;
falls to one third of the original amount, whichever comes first. The deposit of an initial&#13;
amount equivalent to US$17,500 to the Project Advance Account, will be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness of the Credit (para 6.3).&#13;
2.27   Disbursement by IDA against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). Appropriate&#13;
arrangements for accounting and auditing are in place, and the National Coordinator possesses&#13;
the ability to process and maintain SOE documentation in a manner satisfactory to IDA. The&#13;
project coordination unit will claim reimbursement on the basis of SOEs for: (i) civil works&#13;
costing less than US$20,000 equivalent; (ii) goods and equipment contracts of under US$20,000;&#13;
(iii) contracts with consulting firms valued at less than US$50,000; (iv) contracts with individual&#13;
consultants costing less than US$20,000 (including amendments); and (v) all operating costs and&#13;
training. The project coordination unit will retain all the relevant supporting documentation for&#13;
reimbursement claims under SOEs for inspection by supervision missions. During the course of&#13;
the annual audit of the project's accounts, the auditor will certify that all expenditures claimed&#13;
under SOEs during the year have been properly incurred for the project.&#13;
2.28   The disbursement categories for the IDA Credit are presented in Table 2.4 below. IDA&#13;
will finance 100 percent of all categories of foreign costs, excluding identifiable taxes and duties,&#13;
95 percent of local costs of vehicles, equipment and civil works and 100 percent of consultants,&#13;
subcontractors, audit and training, and 90 percent of operating costs, excluding identifiable taxes&#13;
and duties.&#13;
15&#13;
This amount (US$17,500), combined with a similar deposit of US$17,500 required as counterpart for&#13;
the IFAD Loan, add up to US$35,000, the semi-annual contribution of the Govermment to the project.&#13;

2.29   The estimated schedule of IDA Disbursements is given in Table 2.5. The schedule is&#13;
based on the all-sectors standard disbursement profile for the Comoros. There is no specific&#13;
profile for agriculture projects. The schedule reflects the rate of disbursements of the all-sector&#13;
profile spread over a four-year disbursement period to adjust for the three-year duration of this&#13;
pilot project.&#13;

3. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    PROJECT ORGANIZATION&#13;
3.1    The MPEPFE, through its Secretary General (SG), will have overall responsibility for&#13;
implementing the project. The latter will be supported by a Project Steering Committee (PSC)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
whose composition (which will include farner representatives)16 and terms of reference have&#13;
already been approved by IDA and IFAD. The SG and PSC will retain a considerable amount of&#13;
flexibility to adjust the project's components and activities within the limits of the project's&#13;
broad objectives. Adjustments will be based, inter alia, on the results emanating from the&#13;
monitoring of the project's performance indicators (para 3.19) and the conclusions of the studies&#13;
to be carried out under the project. Day-to-day operational support will be provided by the&#13;
National Coordinator, who will assist in the preparation of the annual work programs and&#13;
progress reports, manage project procurement, disbursement and accounting activities, and&#13;
supervise the recruitment and work of sub-contractors. The terms of reference and conditions of&#13;
service of the coordinator have been approved by IDA and IFAD.&#13;
3.2    All agricultural service support and technical assistance activities of the project to be&#13;
implemented by external agencies in the private sector (NGOs, consulting firms, etc.) will&#13;
require contracts between the MPEPFE and the agency concerned. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations with regards to the execution of such contracts between the agencies and the&#13;
MPEPFE (para 6. 1).&#13;
B.     PILOT PROJECT AREAS&#13;
3.3    Given the pilot nature of the project, many of the proposed activities will need to be&#13;
tested over a limited area in order to demonstrate their viability before being implemented on a&#13;
national scale. To make most efficient use of resources and to facilitate coordinated monitoring&#13;
of progress, it was agreed at appraisal that project activities will be concentrated in one selected&#13;
area in each of the three islands, corresponding roughly to an existing extension service area&#13;
(CEA)". A total of 25 villages will be selected from these three areas in order to provide a&#13;
representative sample of the country's 343 villages. As far as possible, the chosen villages&#13;
should not be serviced by existing projects. Under the pilot extension activity, roughly half the&#13;
selected villages will be serviced by private sector providers and the remainder by MPEPFE&#13;
staff who will be given equivalent operating resources and facilities.&#13;
3.4    Village selection will prioritize those villages that have demonstrated interest in&#13;
involvement in project activities. A tangible manifestation of this interest will be the creation of&#13;
Project Village Committees (PVCs) to participate in project decisions affecting their villages and&#13;
monitor project activities at the village level. In each village, the PVC will constitute the focal&#13;
point of implementation discussions particularly with respect to agricultural extension. In each&#13;
case, the extension worker assigned to the village will be an ex-officio advisor to the PVC.&#13;
Whenever possible, the project will work with existing village committees and will not create&#13;
new ones where such committees exist.&#13;
3.5    Selection of project zones and villages and creation of PVCs will be among the first&#13;
tasks leading to the preparation of the project's first year work program.&#13;
16  The members of the PSC will include: the Secretary General of the MPEPFE; representatives of&#13;
INRAPE, the Chamber of Commerce, SNAC, Ministry of Finance, and the head of the MPEPFE's&#13;
Planning Division.&#13;

C.    IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.6    Extn5ion (para 2.7). For this activity, the tasks of the SG and the PSC, supported by the&#13;
18&#13;
MPEPFE's rural development department , will include: (a) selection of extension contractors&#13;
and monitoring consultants; (b) ensuring that extension information provided to farmers is of&#13;
relevance and quality; (c) overseeing the backup roles of PVCs, of INRAPE, and of MPEPFE's&#13;
regional offices; and (d) by the end of the project's second year, preparing assessments of the&#13;
extension experiment and formulating recommendations to the Government concerning the&#13;
nationwide adoption of this approach. A total of 8 private sector extension contractors will be&#13;
recruited. They will be matched with 8 public sector workers. (This total of 16 represents a ratio&#13;
of one extension worker for every 350-400 farms). The objective will be to constitute 3 teams&#13;
(one for each island) comprising 2-3 individual extension workers, covering a total of 7-12&#13;
villages per island. The individuals will need to reside in one of the villages they cover. There&#13;
is in the country a large number of qualified extension workers, most of whom have been trained&#13;
under various projects now completed or were retired early following the Government's&#13;
downsizing. The selection procedure could afford to be reasonably selective in its choice of the&#13;
best candidates.&#13;
3.7    3esearch (para 2.10). For this activity, the tasks of the SG and the PSC, in consultation&#13;
with INRAPE, will include: (a) selection of the specialized agency to assist iNRAPE in&#13;
developing its long-term operational plan and assessment of the agency's recommendations; and&#13;
(b) the review of INRAPE's project-related annual work programs, giving special attention to&#13;
training activities and assessment of results.&#13;
3.8    Communications and Market Development (para 2.1 1). For this activity, the tasks of the&#13;
SG and the PSC will include: (a) Participatory Approach: selecting an external consulting firm&#13;
to pursue the training of trainers; and formulating recommendations on the future use of these&#13;
trainers; (b) Association support: reviewing and deciding on operation-strengthening activities to&#13;
be undertaken by the farmers' association; selecting NGOs to provide this support; reviewing&#13;
performance; (c) Markets and media: concluding an agreement with the Chamber of Commerce&#13;
for Industry and Agriculture (UCCIA) for the latter to coordinate this sub-component and carry&#13;
out collation and analysis of the information collected; concluding an agreement with SNAC for&#13;
the collection of market data for analysis by UCCIA; selecting a local firm to prepare programs&#13;
(using data from UCCIA) and arranging with local media to broadcast market information; and&#13;
selecting a local firm to monitor results at market level. As part of the annual work program, the&#13;
project will submit training programs for IDA review and approval.&#13;
3.9   Planning and Monitoring Support (para 2.12). For this activity, the tasks of the SG and&#13;
the PSC will include: (a) overseeing progress of the Planning Division in achieving its project&#13;
related objectives and preparing the public expenditure program for the agriculture sector; (b)&#13;
selecting consultants to undertake project-supported studies; and (c) overseeing implementation&#13;
of measures to bring existing projects in line with Government strategy.&#13;

D.    ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING&#13;
3.10   Accounting.  A  financial management system  based on modern management&#13;
information requirements was introduced during preparation. The features of the system include:&#13;
setting up budget preparation, monitoring and evaluation systems that meet the project's&#13;
operational and management information requirements, as well as double entry and accrual-&#13;
based accounting as recommended under IASC guidelines applicable to public accounting. The&#13;
system's architecture is based on the concept of integrated financial management which captures&#13;
accounting data only once at the source. Appropriate PC-based computer software will be used&#13;
to support the system.&#13;
3.11   Auditing of project accounts will be facilitated by year-round verification of internal&#13;
controls, and by application of IASC guidelines. The project's accounts will be audited by private&#13;
audit firms, recruited under Bank procedures, which have demonstrated professional&#13;
qualifications and apply standards recognized under IASC auditing guidelines.  Financial&#13;
reporting standards will be in conformity with recent Bank guidelines on financial statements as&#13;
well as norms of the IASC. Financial statements submitted for auditing will comprise, at a&#13;
minimum, a statement of net position (balance sheet equivalent), sources and application of&#13;
funds, a summary budget execution statement, a summary statement on the IDA Special Account&#13;
and withdrawals claimed on the basis of SOEs. Audit reports in the long form will be submitted&#13;
within six months of the end of the fiscal year to which they refer. Assurances to this effect were&#13;
obtained at negotiations (para 6.1).&#13;
E.    PROGRAMMING, MONITORING, EVALUATION, REPORTING&#13;
3.12   Programming. The MPEPFE's Planning Division, assisted by the Coordinator (para&#13;
3.1) will have overall responsibility for coordinating and consolidating annual work programs&#13;
incorporating budget and disbursement estimates, details of procurement, the annual training&#13;
programs and other agreed project details. Work program proposals will be prepared by the&#13;
units or individuals responsible for activities or components before being submitted to the&#13;
Planning Division. Following consolidation by the Planning Division, the programs will be&#13;
submitted to IDA for comments and approval by the end of September of the preceding year.&#13;
Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations (para 6.1).&#13;
3.13   Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting. MPEPFE's Planning Division will also have&#13;
responsibility for overall project monitoring. Given the pilot nature of some of the project's&#13;
operations, some activities (e.g. extension, market development) will have their own built-in&#13;
monitoring arrangements. The information so collected, as well as project-specific information&#13;
collected by the National Coordinator (e.g. procurement, disbursements), will be communicated&#13;
to the Planning Division. The division will be responsible for maintaining the performance&#13;
indicators (see para 3.19 below and Annex 5) as well as providing the SG, and the PSC with&#13;
monthly reports on the project's progress. For IDA and other donors, reports on project&#13;
implementation progress will be submitted semi-annually, at the end of March and September.&#13;
The September report will be submitted to coincide with discussion of the draft annual work&#13;
program for the following year (para 3.12). Information as required for donor supervision will&#13;
be prepared in time for the missions (para 3.14). The Planning Division will also be responsible&#13;
for carrying out the necessary studies, starting in project year two, covering the impact of&#13;
project activities as support for the project's Implementation Completion Report, to be prepared&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
by a consultant in the six month period prior to the closing of the IDA Credit. Assurances to this&#13;
effect were obtained at negotiations (para 6.1).&#13;
F.     SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
3.14   IDA/IFAD Supervision Input. The supervision staff inputs will be largely provided by&#13;
HQ staff with the support of consultants. Under IDA/IFAD arrangements, IDA will be expected&#13;
to have supervision responsibility for the project. IFAD will be informed of all decisions and&#13;
copies of all correspondence and reports will automatically be forwarded to IFAD headquarters&#13;
in Rome. As far as possible, missions will be programmed to coincide with the production of&#13;
progress reports in March and September. Indicative staff week requirements for IDA HQ staff&#13;
are given at Annex 6. Time for consultants will be that of field missions only.&#13;
3.15   Borrower's Contribution to Supervision. The borrower will be required to submit or&#13;
contribute the following:&#13;
(a) semi annual reports on project implementation progress (March and September)&#13;
incorporating M&amp;E findings by monitoring firms (extension, markets) and the MDRPE&#13;
planning division (para 3.13);&#13;
(b) annual work programs incorporating budget and disbursement estimates, details of&#13;
procurement, annual training program and other project details as required (September)&#13;
(para 3.12); and&#13;
(c) audit reports in the long form within six months of the end of the fiscal year (para&#13;
3.11).&#13;
G.    IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
3.16   A detailed Project Implementation Plan will be prepared by MPEPFE in time for&#13;
effectiveness and in anticipation for the project launching workshop to be held at that time (para&#13;
2.15). The plan will be a joint effort of the MPEPFE's Planning Divisior. and the project's&#13;
Coordination unit. It will constitute the Government's own project document and will be&#13;
destined to a wide audience to ensure a good understanding of the project's goals and purposes.&#13;
The preparation of a Project Implementation Plan, satisfactory to IDA, will be a condition&#13;
of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
3.17   The document will include, inter alia: project development objectives; detailed time-&#13;
bound description of components and project activities; description of implementation&#13;
responsibilities and contractual arrangements; terms of reference of consultants and technical&#13;
assistance; schedule of procurement action including target dates for each step; disbursement&#13;
schedule; financing plan and timetable of Government counterpart contributions; accounting and&#13;
financial management arrangements, including appointment of auditors; role of donors and&#13;
supervision plan; details of training programs and arrangements; financial and economic&#13;
analysis, including description of assumptions; and key indicators of development impact,&#13;
physical progress (inputs and outputs) and financial situation.  Performance  monitoring&#13;
indicators are discussed below. A summary implementation timetable is at Annex 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
H.    INDICATORS FOR MONITORING PERFORMANCE&#13;
3.18   Progress of project activities and results will be monitored on the basis of pre-defined&#13;
key indicators and guidelines. To measure the effectiveness of the overall agricultural services&#13;
component as well as the relative performance of the private and public sector extension&#13;
providers, farm level production and marketing in both village and urban markets will be&#13;
sampled systematically and periodically by the consultants hired to monitor this component.&#13;
For agricultural production, a sample of farms will be taken in each of the five village farming&#13;
systems to update the data presented in Supplementary Annex 2 covering area planted and&#13;
cropping pattern, yields and other parameters. For agricultural marketing, the aim will be to&#13;
measure frequently the quantities and prices of marketed produce, as well as price spreads&#13;
between markets, in order to assess the effectiveness of market information and determine its&#13;
influence on farm production and income.&#13;
3.19   The list of key performance indicators to be monitored during this project was approved&#13;
during negotiations. The key performance indicators for the project are listed at Annex 5 in&#13;
relation with the project's objectives, inputs and outputs and are summarized as follows:&#13;
(a) Development Impact Indicators:&#13;
(i) trend in net value of production (as calculated from production levels, yields, prices)&#13;
and farm income;&#13;
(ii) marketed output in selected markets and evolution of price spreads of key crops&#13;
(cassava, banana, plantain, legumes, rice) between markets; and&#13;
(iii) opinion trends of farmers and villagers (as measured by monitoring activities) as to&#13;
efficiency of agricultural services.&#13;
(b) Implementation Indicators:&#13;
(i) level and trend of project expenditures (vs. anticipated at appraisal and in budget);&#13;
(ii) progress of capacity building (hours/days of training; number of persons trained;&#13;
media hours);&#13;
(iii) execution of studies, audits, master plan, etc.;&#13;
(iv) field results (farmers contacted; confirmed adoptions of messages; use of inputs);&#13;
(v) research transfers (number, types and level of distribution of research publications;&#13;
liaison and training sessions dispensed by INRAPE); and&#13;
(vi) conclusions of joint review of budgetary allocation and PIP.&#13;
4. THE BANK GROUP'S ROLE&#13;
A.    LESSONS FROM IDA's INVOLVEMENT IN THE COMOROS' AGRICULTURAL&#13;
SECTOR&#13;
4.1   To date, the Comoros received two IDA credits in agriculture.  The Coconut&#13;
Rehabilitation and Rodent Control Project (closed in December 1988) was designed to extend&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
and improve coconut and copra production on the three islands. Despite positive technical&#13;
results, the limited Government implementation capacity, low level of acceptance of&#13;
recommended hybrids by farmers and the collapse of international copra prices prevented the&#13;
project from achieving its objectives. The institutional and physical infrastructure put in place&#13;
have not been sustainable. Important lessons that have been drawn from the project include: (i)&#13;
project objectives should not be too technically complex and should adequately reflect economic&#13;
and marketing factors; (ii) the agricultural innovations and technical recommendations to be&#13;
introduced by the project should be tailored to the real needs of farmers and; (iii) the&#13;
Government's limited implementation capacity should be addressed.&#13;
4.2    The Rural Services Project (closed in December 1991) which was co-financed with&#13;
IFAD, aimed to strengthen the existing agricultural services at the time, to improve the planning,&#13;
coordination and monitoring of rural development activities and included the expansion of&#13;
livestock and forestry activities. The project was not successful and the resulting lessons indicate&#13;
that efforts to strengthen institutions should: (i) be based on a well-defined and focused sectoral&#13;
strategy; (ii) ensure coordination of donor contributions; (iii) address the problem of limited&#13;
management capacity in the design of farmer support services; (iv) take into account the limited&#13;
financial resources of Government to finance operating costs; and (v) identify the required&#13;
training needs for the operation.&#13;
4.3   The above lessons are reflected in the proposed project through: (a) the consultation/&#13;
participation of beneficiary farners and villagers in project preparation and throughout&#13;
implementation; (b) reliance on the private sector for implementation of most project activities,&#13;
limiting the need to recruit additional Government staff; and (c) the involvement of other donors&#13;
in the preparation and implementation process and provision for regular review, by IDA and&#13;
other donors, of the Government's PEP.&#13;
1.    RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
4.4    The proposed project conforns with the Country Assistance Strategy, reviewed by the&#13;
Board on December 14, 1993. The central objective of Bank assistance is to help the Comoros&#13;
(i) reduce poverty by accelerating sustained economic growth (ii) develop human capital and&#13;
reduce population growth; and (iii) protect the fragile ecosystem. These CAS goals are&#13;
explicitly reflected in the design framework of the project. The project will foster the&#13;
development of institutions and capacity in both the private and public sectors as well as assist&#13;
in formulating appropriate policy and institutional frameworks for agricultural development.&#13;
By building on previous IDA-intervention in the sector (Rural Services Project) and supporting&#13;
environmentally-sustainable productivity growth and agricultural intensification, it will make a&#13;
significant contribution to poverty alleviation. It will enhance the role of the Bank in donor&#13;
coordination, and in the process, improve the efficiency of resource use through the&#13;
mechanism of annual public expenditure. The results from this first phase of intervention will&#13;
help clarify viable, sustainable and efficient frameworks for agricultural service delivery; and&#13;
provide a basis for supporting a full scale follow-on operation in form of an integrated sector-&#13;
wide agriculture and investment program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
B.    DONOR COORDINATION&#13;
4.5    As this project will be a pilot operation, with eventual sector-wide implications over the&#13;
whole country, it will provide an opportunity for both the Government and the donor community&#13;
to further the dialogue on sector issues and approaches to address them. This situation is&#13;
simplified by the few donors currently active in the country (UNDP, CFD, EU, IFAD and French&#13;
Cooperation). All donors were consulted during the preparation process and were kept informed&#13;
of progress. This collaboration will continue throughout project implementation as well as&#13;
through the PEP review process.&#13;
5. PROJECT IMPACT ASSUMPTIONS,&#13;
FINANCIAL/ECONOMIC ANALYSIS, SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
AND RISK ASSESSMENT'9&#13;
A.    IMPACT ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION&#13;
5.1    The Project Area. The 25 villages in which the pilot extension activities of the project&#13;
will be carried out will occupy an area of approximately 22,400 ha, or about 29 percent of the&#13;
country's total land area. Given the country's rugged and irregular topography, the wide range of&#13;
soil quality, and excluding plantations (coconut), cash crops (ylang-ylang, cloves and vanilla)&#13;
and other highly marginal non-cultivable areas, the cultivated area under food crops of the&#13;
project villages will amount to approximately 6,800 hectares. Of this latter area, the appraisal&#13;
mission has also assumed that about 1700 ha of food crop area, or slightly over 25% of the&#13;
covered villages' cultivated area, will benefit directly from the technical and institutional&#13;
innovations to be introduced by the project over the period. Based on an average of about 1.15&#13;
ha per household, the number of farm households to be covered by the Pilot Project will amount&#13;
to about 1400.&#13;
5.2    Production Assumptions.  Although small in size, farm  production is generally&#13;
diversified to provide variety and security against crop or market failure. Inter-cropping and&#13;
multiple cropping, often on several and separate (even dispersed) plots of arable land, by any one&#13;
farm household, are widespread. Rural households normally plant five crops or more per season,&#13;
with up to nine crops during any one year. Four staple crops -- cassava, plantain, bananas and&#13;
rice -- occupy 72% of the land. Annual crops such as bananas, plantain and cassava, are sparsely&#13;
planted, leaving space for one or two associated crops, or a rotation of seasonal crops such as&#13;
maize, yams, sweet potatoes, potatoes and pigeon peas, plus a few square meters for vegetables.&#13;
Despite these well-adapted cropping patterns and the high intensity of land utilization in certain&#13;
parts of the country, such factors as low plant density and variable soil fertility, the use of&#13;
19 This chapter summarizes the contents of Supplementary Annex 2 entitled "Financial and Economic&#13;
Analysis".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
unimproved seed, and the low use of other inputs, result in very low yields for virtually all&#13;
crops. Expressed in equivalent weight per hectare, yields are one-fourth to one-third those of&#13;
countries in the region: rice yields vary between 300 kg - 800 kg/ha depending on location;&#13;
cassava yields average 5.5 tons/ha; potatoes about 7 tons; plantain, 5 tons; and bananas, barely 3&#13;
tons. With proper advice, the use of improved seeds, minimum quantities of fertilizers and plant&#13;
protection products, there is reasonable scope for raising yields over the medium and long term.&#13;
Supplies of fertilizer, seed, planting stock and plant protection materials are available through&#13;
the private sector at market prices.&#13;
5.3    Agricultural Output. The Pilot Project will seek to promote economically feasible and&#13;
environmentally sustainable improvements to the farming systems, cropping patterns and overall&#13;
resource allocation at farm level. It will rely initially on disseminating previously tested&#13;
technology and farming techniques (para 2.9), many of which are already used by commercially&#13;
oriented farmers, or readily available to smaller farmers. Technical messages will be tailored to&#13;
the needs of each crop and to meet the needs of farmer groups. While the main thrust of the&#13;
project will come from the supply of technical advice to farmers and the promotion of&#13;
economical use of inputs, this will be supplemented with non-price incentives to stimulate&#13;
increases of productivity. Providing market information through local and mass media is&#13;
proposed under the project as a cost-effective means of reaching a large number of farms with&#13;
periodic messages about demand and prices. Steps are already under way to standardize weights&#13;
and measures in local markets and shops. Given their novelty and the lack of relevant&#13;
information, the effects that these measures could have on production have not been quantified&#13;
for the purpose of this analysis.&#13;
5.4    The main benefits will accrue to farmers through increases in foodcrop production.&#13;
Based on calculat- s supported by above assumptions (the details of these calculations are in&#13;
Supplementary Annex 2 dealing with financial and economic analysis), it is expected that crop&#13;
production could be increase by about 24% over the project period. Yield and production&#13;
increases are estimated conservatively: yields expected "with project" are indicative of those&#13;
achievedpresently by larger and more resourcefulfarmers in the Comoros.&#13;
B.    FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT&#13;
5.5    For the purpose of this analysis, the costs of project activities designed to result in&#13;
tangible financial benefits, such as those related to agriculture services, have been considered&#13;
and the net present value (NPV) has been used to demonstrate both the economic and financial&#13;
viability of the proposed Pilot Project. The income generated from the production assumptions&#13;
outlined in the paragraphs above has been retained for the benefits stream.&#13;
5.6    At farm level, the relation between financial costs and benefits is viewed from two&#13;
perspectives: (a) from that of each of the five individual farm models retained in the project,&#13;
which suggests if participating in the project can be profitable, and (b) from the point of view of&#13;
the aggregate investment and recurrent costs of agricultural services relative to the net present&#13;
worth of future incremental benefits. As seen in Table 5.1 below, profitability from participating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
in the project is varied. This is because of the very short period and the variable base (without&#13;
project) from which the net value of agricultural production of each farm type begins&#13;

Weighted average     87.6                 108.8          24%&#13;
Source: Supplementary Annex 2 on Financial and Economic Analysis (Sub-Annex 9).&#13;
5.7    The conservative estimate of 24% increase in crop production by participating farmers&#13;
over the project period results in a present value (PV) of net incremental revenues from&#13;
production of about FC 445 million or an equivalent of US$ 845 per farm family, at 15% OCC&#13;
(Opportunity cost of capital). This calculation is based on the aggregate net value of production&#13;
for all farm models, assuming that modest increases in productivity i after the pilot period can&#13;
be maintained. The results are indicative of what could be achieved with present cropping&#13;
patterns and already-known technology, without any other on-farm or infrastructure investments.&#13;
It suggests that modest amounts of investment in agricultural services are appropriate, but that&#13;
additional returns will require more rapid innovations. This could change, over the longer term,&#13;
with the introduction of more advanced technology and cultural practices, and better market&#13;
incentives than in the past. The prospects for such fundamental changes should be perceptible by&#13;
the end of the Pilot Project, so that long term investment choices will be more evident than they&#13;
are at present.&#13;
5.8    Given the above, Pilot Project investments in research, extension and market information&#13;
services will be kept small, implying a minimum level of incremental recurrent costs over the&#13;
ten-year period used for calculations. When project related investment and recurrent costs are&#13;
included, the result will be a positive net present value (NPV) of FC 129 million at 15% OCC&#13;
(about US$ 245 per farm family). Moreover, this result is tempered by its sensitivity in that the&#13;
NPV will become slightly negative if the increase in productivity cannot be sustained after the&#13;
20  The slow short-term supply response in agriculture is acknowledged as the low short-term elasticity&#13;
of supply, which is usually due to fLxed and slowly adjusting scarce factors of production, mainly&#13;
land and labor, to new production and market possibilities.&#13;
21  Calculations assume rates varying from 3% in year 5 to 1% in year 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
pilot period or only one half of the benefits contemplated are reached after the first year (Cf.&#13;
Sub-Annex 12 of Supplementary Annex 2).&#13;
5.9    The preceding estimates will be subject to confirmation before the end of the Pilot&#13;
Project. They are reassuring if services and input supply can be maintained during and after the&#13;
pilot phase in order to bring smallholder agriculture near the level of technology and farming&#13;
techniques used by progressive farmers. This could be achieved with improved seed selection,&#13;
crop rotation, and a minimum of moderate fertilization and plant protection. A case in point will&#13;
be potato production which could enjoy a significant increase after two years or so with the&#13;
introduction of "pure" seed from CIP which will be used to multiply and produce locally&#13;
adaptable potato seed and thereby end dependence on high-cost imported potato seed. Similarly,&#13;
selection of cassava cuttings from among the high-yielding local varieties, or varieties&#13;
recommended by IITA, should double or triple present yields at little additional cost to farmers.&#13;
5.10   In the absence of distortions induced by macro-economic policies, financial and&#13;
economic net present values of the incremental production generated by the project will be about&#13;
the same. However, the financial viability of the project is clearly superior to its economic worth&#13;
when account is taken of the distorting effect of macro-economic policies (particularly that of the&#13;
fixed exchange rate) on real prices and the opportunity costs of resources used in the project.&#13;
This distinction is established by converting financial values into economic ones by means of a&#13;
Standard Conversion Factor (SCF), currently estimated at 0.86 which translates into a foreign&#13;
exchange premium of 1.162 (equivalent to FC 430 per US $) when applied to tradable goods and&#13;
the foreign exchange content of project investments.&#13;
5.11   If the financial values which make up net incremental production are adjusted for&#13;
economic distortions using the SCF, the PV at 15% OCC drops to about FC 350 million&#13;
(US$660 per farm family), confirming further the conclusion of the financial analysis that only&#13;
small amount of investment can be supported by this agriculture in the absence of economic&#13;
distortions.&#13;
5.12   When project related investment and recurrent costs are included in the calculations (the&#13;
same, at economic prices, as those used in the financial analysis), the NPV will be a modest but&#13;
positive FC 14 million at 15% OCC (about US$26 per farm family). If sensitivity is tested using&#13;
the same parameters as for the financial analysis, the results are negative, emphasizing the&#13;
continuing effect of past economic distortions (Cf Sub-Annex 15 of Supplementary Annex 2).&#13;
C.     IMPACT ON POPULATION, INCOME AND POVERTY&#13;
5.13   The target population for the Pilot Project is estimated at about 6000 families, of which&#13;
some 1400 will benefit directly from the project's agricultural service related activities over the&#13;
project's period. Family income estimates at the end of the Pilot Project are considered as&#13;
indicative and represent modest increases ranging between 18% and 27% over the base year by&#13;
year 4 of the project. The project will monitor progress carefully in order to determine if the&#13;
proposed interventions are valid and if adequate incentives are given to farmers. There are,&#13;
however, few alternatives. With prices of cash crops (vanilla, ylang-ylang and cloves) at about&#13;
one-half those of the past in real terms, prospects for alleviating rural poverty remain&#13;
conditioned by the present economic and financial circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
5.14   The Government has yet to produce a good representative household survey of incomes&#13;
and expenditures although one is currently under way with support from the UNDP and the&#13;
Bank. Until the data become available, the degree of rural poverty is not precisely known, but is&#13;
considered to be acute for households whose total income is equivalent to less than FC 360,000&#13;
per year (the subsistence level in September 1995). The rural wage equivalent in Comoros is FC&#13;
750-800 per day, which on a monthly basis (26 days) amounts to about FC 20,000, the equivalent&#13;
of FC 240,000 per year, about the same as the estimated subsistence level before devaluation.&#13;
5.15   Project measures that will be expected to have an impact on poverty will include:&#13;
(a) extension messages and market information will initially support increased domestic&#13;
food crop production (these are the crops produced by the poor) which will help improve&#13;
the nutritional status. Another project premise is that facilitating poor farners' access to&#13;
markets through improved information will serve to encourage production as well as,&#13;
eventually, diversification into other food and export crops;&#13;
(b) the sizable resources earmarked for training (almost 30% of project costs) in various&#13;
forms, much of which is directed to the population, especially through extension and&#13;
farmers' groups. The low level of education among the poor is given as one of the main&#13;
factors for perpetuating poverty.&#13;
5.16   The impact of the foregoing measures will not be immediate, since it will take several&#13;
years for markets to become fully accessible and competitive on each island, including&#13;
commercial outlets for agricultural inputs and services. During the Pilot Project, the gradual&#13;
effect of these changes on project beneficiaries will be monitored, as they influence the&#13;
allocation of land and other resources in order to increase real income. The eventual impact of&#13;
these measures will be expected to be achieved when, and if, a full development project is&#13;
undertaken after the results of the Pilot Project have been assessed.&#13;
D.    IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT&#13;
5.17   One potential economic benefit of the project, albeit not included in the calculations, will&#13;
be the increase in farm level employment. Under-employment at the farm level is chronic,&#13;
especially on small farms. With the project, however, and given the labor-intensive nature of&#13;
crop production, the low level of mechanization and use of draft animals, between 500 and 1,000&#13;
person-years of supplementary on-farm employment is expected to be generated. Non-&#13;
agricultural employment created by the multiplier-effect of increased crop production cannot be&#13;
estimated.&#13;
E.    IMPACT ON PUBLIC EXPENDITURE&#13;
5.18   As part of its agricultural strategy, the Government is committed to bringing all existing&#13;
projects in line with its strategic objectives. The plan to carry through this task was included in&#13;
the strategy statement presented by the Government at the Donor Round Table of October 1994.&#13;
Aligmnent is progressing but more work is needed particularly with regard to implementing the&#13;
participatory approach and to ensure full harmonization between individual project objectives&#13;
and those of the country's strategy. All donors have agreed to lend their support to this process&#13;
through the projects they finance. The Pilot Project will play an important role in this context&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
through the support it will provide to MPEPFE's Planning Division whose role it will be to&#13;
coordinate the reconciliation of all projects with the strategy (para 2.12). Concurrently, and as&#13;
part of the review of the progress in this regard, the Government will, no later than October 31 of&#13;
each year, carry out, in consultation with all concemed donors, an annual review of its Public&#13;
Expenditure Program for the agricultural sector and the environment. Assurances to this effect&#13;
were obtained at negotiations.&#13;
F.     ENVIRONMENTAL CATEGORY&#13;
5.19   An environmental category C has been assigned to this project, as it is expected to&#13;
engender a beneficial impact on the environment. Project activities will directly support efforts&#13;
towards improving sustainability of agricultural production. Technical recommendations will&#13;
support improved cultural practices and prioritize environmental protection measures (for which&#13;
there are proven existing themes), including soil conservation, fertility restoration, plant&#13;
protection, agroforestry, as well as the establishment of live hedges and other erosion control&#13;
techniques. It will also continue to support fertility maintenance through composting, while&#13;
encouraging farmers to use chemical fertilizers where appropriate. Chemical fertilizers will be&#13;
restricted to those which have proven effective in the local context heretofore and with no known&#13;
negative environmental effects.&#13;
G.    SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.20   Project design is geared towards expanding the scope for private sector involvement in&#13;
the delivery of agricultural services, which supplements the weak public sector institutional&#13;
capacity. There are also efficiency gains and increased cost-effectiveness accruing from the&#13;
competition that will be introduced into the system, which in turn have an indirectly positive&#13;
impact on the financial cost of the operations. If successful in developing replicable systems, the&#13;
project could provide a basis for supporting a more sustainable operation on a broader scale,&#13;
during a second phase of interventions. At this latter stage also, based on demonstrated results,&#13;
cost-recovery measures could be considered, if feasible, to reduce the fiscal burden on the state.&#13;
Other features of the project which foster long-term sustainability include the strengthening of&#13;
the sectoral capacity for planning, programming and monitoring, and the enhancement of donor&#13;
coordination (largely through the public expenditure review process). These interventions will&#13;
facilitate the efficient programming of scarce budgetary resources and help improve the overall&#13;
efficiency of resource use in the sector. In addition, the mainstreaming of client consultation in&#13;
project activities, and the provision of support for strengthening capacity in participatory&#13;
development techniques, helps ensure sustainability by capturing stakeholder interest and&#13;
commitment in agricultural development activities. Finally, the contents of extension messages&#13;
will be geared towards promoting sustainable utilization of natural resources.&#13;
H.    RISK ASSESSMENT&#13;
5.21   Major risks that the project may face include: (a) a low level of farmer participation and&#13;
response due to the lingering lack of credibility of existing agricultural services; and (b) a low&#13;
level of effective use of project-produced technological and market information. Regular&#13;
monitoring of results and systematic consultation with the beneficiaries should ensure that&#13;
feedback to project managers on the quality and impact of services enables them to address gaps&#13;
in implementation. Measures to be put in place by the project include: (i) continuous monitoring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
through both private sector providers and public sector facilities; and (ii) continuing dialogue&#13;
and mainstreaming the process of participation started during project preparation, involving will-&#13;
be beneficiaries and project managers.&#13;
5.22   An additional risk facing this project stems from the budgetary constraints of the&#13;
government and the possibility that the latter will be unable to sustain financing of its share even&#13;
at the modest level projected. Public finance issues are being addressed in the context of the&#13;
second structural adjustment program under preparation. The new government has already taken&#13;
measures to improve revenue collection by strengthening the customs administration and to cut&#13;
expenditures through continued civil service reform and reduction of civil servants allowances.&#13;
This should help mitigate the risk of shortages in counterpart funding. In addition, the&#13;
government is currently seeking alternative resources in the form of grant funds to cover its&#13;
contribution in order to reduce its dependence on fiscal resources.&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED WITH THE BORROWER,&#13;
CONDITIONS OF EFFECTIVENESS AND&#13;
RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1    The following assurances were obtained during negotiations:&#13;
(i) The Government has included its fiscal 1997 counterpart contribution to project costs&#13;
in its investment budget (para 2.18);&#13;
(ii) The work program for each year incorporating budget and disbursement estimates,&#13;
details of procurement, the annual training program and other agreed project details to be&#13;
deternined in the course of supervision, will be prepared and submitted to IDA for&#13;
comments and approval by the end of September of the preceding year (para 3.12); and&#13;
(iii) The Government will, no later than October 31 of each year, carry out, in&#13;
conjunction with the association, a joint annual review of the Project and Borrower&#13;
performance, to review progress (a) in the implementation of the project (para 3.13) and&#13;
(b) in carrying out an annual review of its Public Expenditure Program affecting the&#13;
agricultural and the environment sectors (para 5.18);&#13;
(iv) All agricultural service support and technical assistance activities of the project to be&#13;
implemented by external agencies in the private sector (NGOs, consulting firms, etc.)&#13;
will require contracts between the MPEPFE and the agency concerned. (para 3.2);&#13;
(v) The procurement procedures and arrangements agreed at negotiations will be applied&#13;
throughout the project (paras 2.19-2.24);&#13;

(vi) The project's accounts will be audited by an independent auditor satisfactory to IDA,&#13;
having demonstrated professional qualifications and applying auditing standards&#13;
recognized under IASC's auditing guidelines. Audit reports in the long form will be&#13;
submitted within six months of the end of the fiscal year to which they refer (para 3.11);&#13;
and&#13;
(vii) A Project Implementation Completion Report will be prepared during the six&#13;
months prior to Credit closing (para 3.13);&#13;
6.2    The following were approved during negotiations:&#13;
(i) Agreement has been reached with Government on the types and numbers of&#13;
indicators for monitoring performance under the project (para 3.19).&#13;
6.3    The following will be conditions of effectiveness of the credit:&#13;
(i) All bid documents for the project's first year of implementation to be prepared to the&#13;
satisfaction of IDA (para 2.24);&#13;
(ii) The deposit of an initial amount equivalent to US$17,500 by Government to the&#13;
project advance account, to cover its contribution to project expenditures (para 2.26);&#13;
(iii) The preparation of a Project Implementation Plan satisfactory to IDA (para 3.16);&#13;
and&#13;
(iv) The fulfillment of all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the IFAD Loan&#13;
Agreement, other than those related to the effectiveness of the IDA credit agreement&#13;
(para. 2.15).&#13;
6.4    With the above assurances and conditions, the above project will be suitable for an IDA&#13;
Credit of SDR 1.1 million.&#13;

            The objectives of the Pilot Agricultural
            Services Project are to produce replicable service systems
            and support the strengthening of the capacity to implement
            its agricultural strategy.  The project, to be implemented
            over a three year period, will contain two components.  The
            agricultural services component will include: a) testing
            private sector delivery of extension services; b) converting
            the country's research establishment into a depository/
            clearing house of agricultural technical information adapted
            to Comorian conditions'; and c) improving information
            access through training, media, and support to farmer
            organizations.  The planning and monitoring support
            component will support the planning division, providing for
            computers, office equipment, staff training, and sector
            specific studies including: a rural finance study, a land
            tenure feasibility study, and an agricultural baseline study.
