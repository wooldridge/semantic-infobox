Part II Europe 2020 Programmatic Single-Donor Trust Fund Description&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of the Administration Agreement for the Trust&#13;
Fund between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
1. Objectives&#13;
The objectives of the Trust Fund are:&#13;
The European Commission and the Bank share a common objective of building competitive and&#13;
sustainable economies and reducing poverty and social exclusion - goals of the Europe 2020 Agenda&#13;
which is built on three pillars of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The European Commission and&#13;
the Bank concur that direct interaction is beneficial to both institutions and through them to the&#13;
beneficiary countries. This applies particularly to the provision of analytical, advisory and knowledge&#13;
services and technical assistance.&#13;
The European Commission has expressed an interest in ensuring that the Bank continues to provide&#13;
technical assistance in the framework of the Trust Fund in furtherance of the common objective set forth&#13;
above.&#13;
2. Activities&#13;
The sub-objectives and description of activities are:&#13;
2.1 The European Commission, particularly the Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and&#13;
Inclusion, supports the analysis of labour market and social inclusion policies and the development of&#13;
policy recommendations on the basis of profiles of 'out of work" and 'low work intensity' individuals in&#13;
its Member States. The activity's overall objective is to inform the EC and EU Member States' labor&#13;
market activation and social inclusion policies through an improved understanding of the characteristics&#13;
and labor market barriers of 'out-of work' and 'low-work-intensity' individuals.&#13;
This includes continued assistance to develop detailed "profiles" or "portraits" of individuals with no or&#13;
limited labor-market attachment and identify distinct groups of individuals who are the potential clients of&#13;
income support and employment support policies with the objective of contributing to the decrease of the&#13;
population that is at risk of poverty or social exclusion by strengthening the empirical basis for analyzing&#13;
active inclusion.&#13;
The activities (which may be described as "components" of activities) to be financed by the Trust Fund,&#13;
in support of the sub-objectives cited in Section 2.1 above, are the following Bank-executed activities, for&#13;
which the Bank has implementation responsibility:&#13;
(a) The Bank shall jointly with the OECD prepare a paper describing, applying and illustrating the&#13;
clustering methodology chosen to derive the salient profiles of 'out-of-work' and 'low-work-&#13;
intensity' individuals. The description of the joint methodology will be based on EU-SILC data of&#13;
one or two Member States included in the analysis and will contain a sample Profile Analysis&#13;
Note (PAN).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿The paper is intended to provide a guide for interpreting results from the country studies and will&#13;
include (i) a definition of the target population and a statistical overview of this population in&#13;
countries included in this Action and in other relevant comparator countries as appropriate; (ii) a&#13;
detailed presentation of the statistical clustering approach, (iii) a discussion of its rationale,&#13;
advantages and disadvantages relative to alternative approaches, (iv) a discussion of data issues,&#13;
measurement choices and limitations; (v) an illustration of the approach using available data for&#13;
one or two countries.&#13;
(b) The Bank shall prepare six (6) Country-specific "Profile Analysis Notes" and "Country Policy&#13;
Papers (CPP)"' of unemployed, inactive and low-work-intensity individuals. The clusters will be&#13;
derived through the application of a mutually agreed methodology for Latent-Class-Analysis to&#13;
available EU-SILC data. The Country-specific Cluster Models described in the "Profile Analysis&#13;
Notes" will be the basis for a more detailed "Country Policy Papers" to be prepared by the Bank&#13;
describing activation and labor market inclusion barriers for a set of prioritized groups in the&#13;
respective countries. The prioritized groups will be chosen in dialogue with the country and the&#13;
EC.&#13;
The Profile Analysis Notes will contain the following information for each cluster, given the&#13;
available data quality:&#13;
-   Size. Number of individuals in cluster.&#13;
-   Labor market status. Shares of individuals that are unemployed, long-term&#13;
unemployed, inactive and in low work intensity.&#13;
-   Labor market barriers. A characterization of the main labor market barriers faced&#13;
by each cluster. Barriers of incentive, capability and opportunity will be reported and&#13;
summarized in an intuitive way.&#13;
-   Social inclusion status. Poverty-related indicators (share of individuals in lower&#13;
income quintiles) will be reported to demonstrate the degree of social inclusion.&#13;
-   Individual life and household situation. Where not already covered by the labor&#13;
market barriers, characteristics such as age, gender, education, work experience,&#13;
household composition will be reported.&#13;
-   Patterns of benefit receipt. Shares of individuals receiving specific benefits&#13;
(unemployment, disability, old-age pension, social assistance, family and child) will&#13;
be reported in relation to the clusters' labor market status.&#13;
The resulting groupings will be country specific, driven by the specific demographic, social and&#13;
economic characteristics of individuals and their household contexts. They are intended to&#13;
provide a novel and policy-relevant perspective on employment barriers, complementing standard&#13;
statistical tools and indicators for monitor the situation of people with no or little labour-market&#13;
attachments (such as common tabulations from labour-force surveys).&#13;
(c) The Bank shall organize seminars, workshops and participation in joint country missions, audio&#13;
or video-conferences with EU Member States representatives, European Commission, World&#13;
Bank, and OECD experts/staff on the Profile Analysis Notes (Country Prioritization Discussion)&#13;
and on a draft of the Country Policy Papers (Country Dialogue Missions) to present and validate&#13;
findings, prioritize areas of work within the activity and discuss the application and translation of&#13;
findings to Member State policies.&#13;
Unless otherwise agreed with the European Commission the Bank shall carry out this activity in the following EU member&#13;
States: Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania, Romania, Croatia, and Poland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿(d) The Bank shall jointly with the OECD prepare and present a Final Report collecting,&#13;
summarizing and synthesizing the findings from the Country Policy Discussion Papers and carry&#13;
out a project closing seminar with participating Member States representatives, European&#13;
Commission, World Bank, and OECD experts/staff to discuss the findings gathered in the Final&#13;
Report Document.&#13;
(e) The Bank shall jointly with the OECD provide training and capacity building on profiling&#13;
methodologies and approaches to the participating EU Member States through (i) a brief country&#13;
data and methodology note, and (ii) a training seminar for application of clustering methodology&#13;
to available country statistical or administrative data or other activities that deepen the dialogue&#13;
and policy analysis of the Country Policy Paper. The activities envisioned during such training&#13;
seminars could include country-to-country virtual peer learning events to facilitate knowledge&#13;
exchange among focus countries.&#13;
The following indicative table of outputs provides an overview of the outputs to be delivered by the&#13;
World Bank. The Delivery Schedule is timed counting from the date of joint effectiveness of this&#13;
Administrative Agreement together with the parallel Administrative Agreement to be concluded with the&#13;

ï»¿Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion 2.0 (P153368)&#13;
Visibility Note for European Commission / World Bank&#13;
Scope and purpose of this note: this note outlines the intended communication and visibility activities&#13;
for the "Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion 2.0" activity.&#13;
Caveat re. OECD: While this note covers the visibility and communication approaches of the World Bank&#13;
and the European Commission within this task, the overall task "Portraits 2.0" is likely going to be a&#13;
cooperation between the European Commission, the World Bank and the OECD. Owing to this trilateral&#13;
cooperation, some of the final outputs might have to include the visual identity of all three&#13;
organizations. We understand that corresponding arrangements for visibility and communication are to&#13;
be established between the EC and the OECD in the context of the respective financing agreement.&#13;
A. Objectives and Tarnget Groups&#13;
A.1.   Overall objective of the "Portraits 2.0" action&#13;
The objective of the proposed action is to inform EU Member States' labor market and social inclusion&#13;
policies design through an evidence-based understanding of the profiles of 'out of work" and 'low work&#13;
intensity' individuals. The focus of this project proposal is on the countries for which the World Bank will&#13;
have the lead authorship: Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania. Another six&#13;
countries (Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain) will be covered by the OECD as lead author&#13;
(final designation of countries to be decided by EC DG EMPL).&#13;
A.2.   Overall communication objectives of the action&#13;
The overall communication objectives are to communicate the results of the analytical work in a&#13;
focused, applicable and policy-relevant manner to decision makers, influencers and the interested&#13;
public. The primary objective of the action is analytics and policy dialogue. Communication efforts to the&#13;
defined target audiences will be undertaken within the available resources of the defined work program.&#13;
The action will not undertake "communication for communication's sake", e.g. supporting general&#13;
awareness or PR campaigns.&#13;

Project Proposal / Supplementary Task Description&#13;
VERSION: v3 - March 31st 2015&#13;
Context, scope, and purpose of this document This document lays out a project proposal for the&#13;
European Commission for the continuation of the World Bank "Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion"&#13;
(TF015289/P143636) activity. A concurrent / parallel 'action' will be proposed by OECD, as&#13;
referenced in the document The commencement of the joint work with OECD might require&#13;
additional legal documents (institutional framework agreement, administrative agreement, etc.)&#13;
between the OECD and the EC which are outside of the scope and control of this proposal. As&#13;
requested by EC DG Employment in June 2014, the underlying table of deliverables has been&#13;
discussed and agreed together with the OECD Social Policy Division.&#13;

ï»¿EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
The objective of the proposed action is to inform EU Member States' labor market and social&#13;
inclusion policies design through an evidence-based understanding of the profiles of 'out of work"&#13;
and 'low work intensity' individuals. The focus of this project proposal is on the countries for which&#13;
the World Bank will have the lead authorship: Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Lithuania, Poland, and&#13;
Romania. Another six countries (Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain) will be covered by&#13;
the OECD as lead author (final designation of countries to be decided by EC DG EMPL).&#13;
After a "Project Initiation Seminar" with Member States, EC and OECD in the beginning of the&#13;
activity, the "Portraits 2.0" activity will derive socio-economic profiles of the out-of-work and low-&#13;
work intensity individuals for the participating EU Member States. These "Profile Analysis Notes"&#13;
will identify the labor supply side barriers for each profile. Building on this initial analysis, Member&#13;
States' priorities for further and deeper analysis on select groups will be elicited from "Profile&#13;
Prioritization Discussions". Joint "Country Dialogue Missions" will be based on "Country Policy&#13;
Papers", a set of more detailed analytical pieces with potential policy approaches for greater labor&#13;
market inclusion and activation. A final report document with learnings across all 12 countries and&#13;
a "Project Closing Seminar" will close the activity. Knowledge transfer and capacity building with&#13;
interested Member States will be a key task in the second year of the run time of the activity.&#13;
The activity is a continuation and analytic deepening of the "Portraits of Labor Market Inclusion"&#13;
(P143636) task. By providing an insight into the "demography of exclusion", it acts as a&#13;
complementary activity to the "EU Poverty Maps" (P130960) which lay out the "geography of&#13;
exclusion" in EU Member States.&#13;

ï»¿1. Background and Rationale for Activity&#13;
In the European Union, many countries show elevated levels of unemployment, inactivity and long-&#13;
term unemployment, especially since the onset of the financial and economic crisis in 2008.&#13;
Prolonged unemployment often goes hand-in-hand with a deteriorating social situation of the&#13;
households and individuals it affects.&#13;
In addition to formally declared unemployment, discouraged and demotivated workers together&#13;
with early retirees and stay-at-home parents, form a group of individuals who are inactive in the&#13;
labor market. Under the demographic situation in many EU countries -with a shrinking working-&#13;
age population- inactivity needs to be regarded jointly with unemployment in order to mitigate the&#13;
effects of aging and rising dependency ratios.&#13;

--AROP or Social Exclusion (% of Population, EU-27)&#13;
Source: Eurosa -Unemployment Rate - Less than 25 years old (EU-28 annual)&#13;
Another issue of concern is in fact demographic change in Europe. As the baby boomers' cohort&#13;
approaches retirement, the younger cohorts entering the labor market are smaller due to the low&#13;
birth rate of the past decades. The results are a population that is older, and an active labor force&#13;
that is shrinking over time. This demographic change, coupled with high youth unemployment, will&#13;
have significant effects on Europe's fiscal balances at a time when the size of the older generations&#13;
in need of adequate pensions and health care continues to increase.&#13;
In the face of the challenges listed above, moving people from inactivity to activity, and from&#13;
unemployment into gainful employment is a key challenge for EU Member States in the near&#13;
future. Among other things, one needs to understand the various labor market barriers&#13;
faced by individuals. Such barriers can be summarized into three broad categories.&#13;
V3, 31-March 2015&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿1.   The first, capability, relates to the individual's ability to take on work. For instance, an&#13;
individual's ability to work could be affected by his or her skills and work experience, as well&#13;
as by his or her health or disability status. Other obstacles that may hinder one's ability to&#13;
work may include care responsibilities or access to transportation.&#13;
2.   A second categorical barrier to employment is a lack of opportunity. For instance, if there&#13;
are no sufficient job offers in a particular area, an individual may experience long spells of&#13;
unemployment or become discouraged from the labor market altogether. Some individuals&#13;
may also face a lack of opportunities if they face a labor market that is discriminatory (e.g.,&#13;
towards people of certain national or ethnic origin, gender, age, etc.).&#13;
3.   Lastly, the third broad category is a lack of incentives. In particular, having sufficient income&#13;
to maintain a decent standard of living may de-incentivize some individuals from entering the&#13;
labor force.&#13;

As said, with government budgets under stress and an environment marked by demographic&#13;
changes, using the labor force to its full potential is key. To do so, knowing what the out-of-&#13;
work population looks like and the barriers faced by individuals is fundamental to a holistic&#13;
approach to policymaking with respect to the inactive and the unemployed. As such, this&#13;
activity aims to generate "profiles" or "portraits" of individuals who have no or limited labor-&#13;
market attachment Its objective is to influence EU Member States' labor market activation and&#13;
social inclusion policies. The activity builds on the work of "Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion"&#13;
undertaken in 2013 and 2014. The profiles will be derived using the latest available European&#13;

ï»¿Union Statistics of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) surveys and focus on those who defined&#13;
themselves as unemployed, retired or inactive at the time of the survey.&#13;
The portraits attach stories to statistics. They identify distinct groups of individuals who are the&#13;
potential clients of income - and employment - support policies by examining detailed labor market,&#13;
demographic and social circumstances. The analysis is a pragmatic way of looking at individuals&#13;
through the lenses of both poverty/welfare status and labor market indicators. In a sense it&#13;
combines labor market analysis and poverty profiling.&#13;
While the productive inclusion of citizens and residents in any country depends on competitive and&#13;
dynamic markets for labor demand, the focus of this activity is on the labor supply side, where a&#13;
combination of factors around social condition, benefit receipt, qualifications and work experience&#13;

By creating profiles of citizens and residents who are inactive or unemployed, "Portraits" moves&#13;
beyond a traditional analysis of the unemployed. This "joined-up" view on the parts of the&#13;
population that are challenged with labor market participation can help to link and improve&#13;
different government services around these intricate problems of labor supply and family&#13;
conditions.&#13;
The countries covered under this activity, to different extents, have been investing in public&#13;
employment services, active labor market policies, as well as in social assistance programs and&#13;
social services to reduce labor market exclusion and with the objective of activating the inactive.&#13;
Figure 4 below shows the expenditure on Public Employment Services, ALMPs, and labor market&#13;
policy support programs (mostly noncontributory unemployment benefits and early retirement&#13;
benefits); from the graphs it is clear that gaps remain and all of the six countries analyzed generally&#13;

ï»¿spend somewhat less than the EU-28 average (as a percentage of GDP) on such policy tools2. In&#13;
particular, in many countries social services like child care, elderly care, or infrastructure services&#13;
like rural transport links (which can play an important role in the enabling of citizens to participate&#13;
successfully in the economy) do not figure among the core policy approaches of labor market policy&#13;
and social benefit policy.&#13;

the six countries included in the PoLME 1.0 task, selecting those in which the WB has the deepest engagement in the area&#13;
of Social Protection and Labor. The remaining two were chosen among the additional countries selected to be included in&#13;
the PoLME 2.0 task, focusing again on those where the World Bank has a deeper engagement in Social Protection and&#13;
Labor relative to the OECD team. Further details can be found in the sections below.&#13;

Aware of the tight budget constraints faced by EU countries, by taking a deeper look at the profiles&#13;
of out-of-work and low-work intensity individuals, Portraits 2.0 then aims to identify gaps and&#13;
refocus labor market as well as social assistance programs and social services aimed at reducing&#13;
exclusion among specific groups of individuals excluded from the labor markets. Bringing different&#13;
Government agencies around one table for a joined discussion about these challenges is one of the&#13;
main benefits of the "Portraits" approach.&#13;

The analytical results of the "Portraits" analysis can be positioned for further use by government&#13;
agencies and institutions of social and labor policy implementation. The Portraits reports are more&#13;
detailed and holistic than traditional labor market statistics, yet the groupings they produce cannot&#13;
be immediately turned around for operational/agency-level profiling of applicants, beneficiaries or&#13;
participants. Rather, Portraits help to prioritize and orient programming choices between centers&#13;
of government and executing agencies. They also can help to align vision and prioritization among&#13;
different government agencies.&#13;

ï»¿The activity of Portraits 2.0 is informed by the learnings drawn at the Portraits 1.0 results&#13;
workshop on 26 May 2014 in Brussels. Academic experts (Prof. Werner Eichhorst, Director of&#13;
Labor Policy Europe, IZA, and Dr. Zsombor Cseres-Gergely, from the Hungarian Academy of&#13;
Sciences, Center for Regional and Economic Studies, Institute of Economics) commented on the&#13;
findings, the methodology, limitations and potential areas for further improvement Among the&#13;
salient points of the experts were the following:&#13;
*    Recognized the attractiveness of a holistic approach around social protection and labor&#13;
policies;&#13;
*    Underlined that heterogeneity still remains within the groups, so deriving latent class analysis&#13;
profiles for policy planning does not substitute for individualized service provision to the&#13;
citizen (in balance with fiscal affordability and administrative capacity);&#13;
*    Encouraged the project team to use more recent survey data (2011 data presented in 2014)&#13;
but also recognized the inherent time lags of EU-homogenized SILC data&#13;
*    Stressed the importance of whole economy/labor demand side reforms to provide the&#13;
economic dynamic to absorb the unemployed and inactive;&#13;
*    Recommended application of a more extensive analytical approach to deriving policy&#13;
recommendations from the descriptions of the profiling, underlining the need to address all&#13;
levels of policy action: (i) whole economy reforms, (ii) program-level ALMP type&#13;
interventions, and (iii) benefits and services to individual citizens.&#13;
In closing of the May 2014 workshop, Dr. Lieve Fransen of the European Commission Directorate&#13;
General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion highlighted several points that emerged from&#13;
the discussion. The general quality of the analytical tool and its embedding into the dialogue&#13;
between the Member States and EC, as well as the quality of the discussion with Member States&#13;
throughout the project, was appreciated. While there is still the need to derive a more differentiated&#13;
set of policy responses and not settle for simplistic policy prescriptions for certain demographics,&#13;
she remarked on the usefulness of the Portraits methodology. Portraits-type analysis is a tool that&#13;
could be used in the future for "social investment" choices in Member States, and also has the&#13;
potential to be used in performance monitoring for ESF activities between the European&#13;
Commission and Member States, she said.&#13;

Importance of labor demand    structural change are the necessary condition for labor demand.&#13;
side reforms               * 'Portraits 2.0' will remain focused on the labor supply and social&#13;

policy proposals              support the employment of the three prioritized groups&#13;
Based on the above, and on extensive discussions held between the World Bank team, the OECD,&#13;
and the EC DG EMPL, the main innovations of the Portraits 2.0 task are:&#13;
*    New analysis based on most recent data, conditional on data availability;&#13;
*    Deep dives on selected clusters in focus countries to better understand the clusters' profiles&#13;
and constraints, and to put forward more detailed and targeted policy recommendations;&#13;
*    Partnership with OECD to exploit synergies across the institutions and leverage WB and&#13;
OECD's knowledge on new and old EU Member States;&#13;
*    Expanded geographical coverage beyond the focus countries covered in Portraits 1.0;&#13;
*    Broader focus. Portraits will focus not only on the out-of-work population but also on low-&#13;
work-intensity individuals;&#13;
*    Capacity building activities on the topic of cluster analysis and policy design in a selected&#13;
number of focus countries and based on client demand.&#13;

I The task described in this note is the continuation of an activity carried out throughout 2013 and&#13;
2014, which resulted in therecent publitation of a 16int World Bank/European Commission report&#13;
titled "Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion' (beceforth PoLME 1.0 for simplicity). The activity,&#13;
| which was financed by the Europca-_Commistil, Directqfate General of Employment, Social&#13;

countries was decided by the EC DG EMPL, In lightef the mos recent economic and labor market&#13;
developments, with advice from the World Bank team Initial drafts of the country reports were&#13;
written by the World Bank and submitted to A At revid* with the respective EC DG EMPL&#13;
Country Desk. Following feedback, changes and adtions received from these meetings, a second&#13;
draft of the report was presented and discussed dutIng joint country missions of EC DG EMPL and&#13;
the World Bank with the respective Member States throughout 2014. These missions occurred on&#13;
the following dates (all 2014), Bulgaria,.ganuary 23), Lithuania (March 13), Estonia (March 14),&#13;
Romania (April 7), Greece (April 10), Tfungary AMrl 28). During and after the joint county&#13;
missions, Member States provided feedback and additional material for the reports. Finally, a&#13;
results workshop was held in Brussels, Belgium, oh May 26,2014, jointly organized by the World&#13;
Bank and the European Commission, to presentpotential themes for discussion derived from the&#13;
study and receive inputs from national delegations and policy ixperts.&#13;

ï»¿2. Scope and Methodology of Work&#13;
2.1 Approach and Phasing of Work&#13;
At the request of the European Commission, and following discussions between the World Bank,&#13;
the OECD, and the EC DG EMPL, the proposed engagement model of "Portraits of Labor Market&#13;
Exclusion 2.0" will be broader and deeper than the previous activity. Building on an update of the&#13;
analysis for the 6 countries from the first wave of activity (Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Hungary,&#13;
Lithuania, Romania), additional countries will be added to the scope (broadening). All country&#13;
analytics will be conducted using the EU-SILC data sets. Where possible, the national EU-SILC data&#13;
will be used, which tends to be available in a more timely manner.&#13;

The joint beginning of activities will depend on the eventual signing of a parallel&#13;
administrative and financing agreement between the EC and the OECD. The main phases of the&#13;
activity will be structured around a joint methodology definition of World Bank and OECD, a very&#13;
dialogue-oriented core phase of project initiation seminar, analysis and Member State policy&#13;
discussions, and a documentation and summary phase that will comprise a final seminar and the&#13;
publication a the summary report.&#13;
In order to anchor the findings of the "Portraits" approach deeper into Member States proprietary&#13;
country systems for policy planning and program execution, or in order to continue specific&#13;
dialogue topics, Portraits 2.0 will comprise a "knowledge transfer" phase in 2016, during which&#13;
interested Member States can draw support in agreement with EC DG EMPL. This phase will allow&#13;
for the conduct of methodological workshops, technical dialogue with National Statistics Agencies,&#13;
Labor Market Observatories and Planning Units in National Governments or key national agencies&#13;
(e.g. National Public Employment Service, National Social Service Institutes, etc.). The following&#13;
table provides a conceptual overview of the different phases. Section 3 will give a more detailed&#13;

Portraits 2.0. Participant countries in Portraits 1.0 are automatically slated for participation. Among&#13;
the criteria to be applied for country prioritization for Portraits 2.0, (i) recent Country-specific&#13;
recommendations from the European Commissions in the field of Employment and Social Policies,&#13;
(ii) OECD accession status, or (iii) a strong or emerging World Bank work program with the&#13;
respective Member State can be cited.&#13;

Maintaining a 6:6 distribution of countries with 'lead authorship' assignments between the&#13;
organizations, the following list of countries has emerged from the discussions: Bulgaria, Croatia,&#13;
Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Spain. The final&#13;
list and distribution will of course be designated by the European Commission. In choosing the&#13;
countries, it has to be noted that OECD is barred from working on Cyprus.&#13;
2.3. Data sources&#13;
The Portraits of Labor Market Inclusion could be greatly enhanced with the analysis of more recent&#13;
data. The data used in Portraits 1.0 corresponded to the harmonized EU-SILC data provided by&#13;
Eurostat. Such data have a two-year lag. If these same data are used for Portraits 2.0, the latest data&#13;
that will be available in March 2015 will be data corresponding to the 2013 survey, meaning that&#13;
the analysis will fail to capture any significant changes in the labor market in 2014 that may have&#13;
shifted the size and composition of clusters of out of work or marginally employed. For this reason,&#13;
an effort to obtain the 2014 national EU-SILC data from the corresponding national statistics offices&#13;
of the 12 countries under analysis will be assumed, with the aim to acquire the 2014 national EU-&#13;
SILC data by April 2015. If National EU-SILC data cannot be obtained by Q1/2015, EU-harmonized&#13;
data published in spring 2015 will be used. Table 3 gives an overview of the data types, their&#13;
publication and reference year.&#13;

The World Bank has recent experience in gaining access to national EU-SILC data from several EU-&#13;
11 countries for the EU Poverty Maps project, including Bulgaria, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,&#13;
Estonia, and Romania. In that context, anonymized EU-SILC micro-data may be subject to fewer&#13;
restrictions than Census data (used for the EU Poverty Maps). In order to facilitate full access to the&#13;
data, a letter could be initially sent by EC DG EMPL explaining the Portraits project, why the use of&#13;
most recent EU-SILC data would be beneficial to policy makers, and the intention to restrict the use&#13;
of the data to only the Portraits task.&#13;
The actual use of 2014 national EU-SILC data in the analyses will depend on the timeliness of the&#13;
receipt of the data (that is, by April 2015), on the state of the data received and the concurrent&#13;
effectiveness of the two parallel legal and financing agreements between the EC and the World&#13;
Bank and the OECD respectively.&#13;
The data should be sent in a file format that can be easily accessed, preferably in Stata format&#13;
containing data labels. A variable dictionary in English and the corresponding English version of the&#13;
survey questionnaire should also be provided. More importantly, in order to ensure comparability&#13;
with the analyses done for previous years, the data should contain the aggregated harmonized EU-&#13;
SILC variables pertaining to household and personal income, as well as any other variables that may&#13;
require imputation on the part of the national statistics office (a list of the variables that will be&#13;
used in the analysis can be sent in advance). If the data are not received in a user-friendly format&#13;
that includes clear data labels and a corresponding data dictionary and survey questionnaire,&#13;
ensuring proper use and analysis of the data may require a prolonged process of back and forth&#13;
communication between the World Bank/OECD and the national statistics offices, leading to&#13;
substantial delays in the analysis of the data. EC DG EMPL would be supporting this data acquisition&#13;
effort with EUROSTAT and National Statistics Institutes within its mandate.&#13;

ï»¿2.4 Methodology for Clustering: Latent Class Analysis&#13;
Descriptive statistics enable the illustration of the heterogeneity of a particular population in a&#13;
limited number of dimensions. Without other measures, it is challenging to synthetically describe&#13;
individuals in the population according to their prevailing characteristics. Latent Class Analysis&#13;
provides a useful tool in this direction.&#13;
The main purpose of latent class analysis (LCA) is to identify an organizing principle for a complex&#13;
array of variables. This latent variable model uses "categorical observed variables, representing&#13;
characteristics, behaviors, symptoms, or the like as the basis for organizing people into two or more&#13;
meaningful homogeneous subgroups" (Collins and Lanza 2010). Formally, LCA enables a&#13;
characterization of a categorical latent (unobserved) variable, starting from an analysis of the&#13;
relationships among several observed variables (named "indicators"), using a maximum likelihood&#13;
estimation method. The estimation model used in this study also includes covariates, which are&#13;
"variables that may be used to describe or predict (rather than to define or measure) the latent&#13;
classes and if active, to reduce classification error" (Vermunt and Magidson, 2005).&#13;
Through LCA, individuals are scored according to the likelihood of belonging to each of the&#13;
computed latent classes, and then assigned to the class to which they have the highest posterior&#13;
probability of belonging (modal assignment) given their observed characteristics. Statistics such as&#13;
the Bayesian Indicator Criterion (BIC) are used to identify the most appropriate number of classes,&#13;
that is, the model that has on average the highest likelihood of predicting class membership for all&#13;
individuals in the given sample.&#13;
A fundamental assumption underlying LCA is that of local independence, which implies that each of&#13;
the chosen indicator variables is related to the others uniquely through the latent class&#13;
membership, and a random error. Advanced computational techniques allow detecting and, in part,&#13;
controlling for the correlation between the residuals of selected indicators, thus enabling the use of&#13;
the available information to construct categories.&#13;
Box 2: Latent class analysis&#13;
Latent,class analysis (LCA) enables a characterization of categorical latent (unobserved) variables&#13;
from an analysis of the structure of the relationships among several categorical observed&#13;
variables, LCA is thus "the classification of similar objects into groups, where the number of&#13;
groups, as well as their forms is unknown" (Kaufman and RousseeUw, 1990). The method was&#13;
originally conceived of as an analytic method for survey data. As an exploratory technique, LCA&#13;
can be used to reduce a set of categorically scored variables into a single latent variable with a set&#13;
of underlying types or "classes". As a confirmatory method, the latent class model can be used to&#13;
test hypotheses regarding the researchers' a priori assertions about the structure of the&#13;
relationship among the observed variables. In this note, LCA was used as an exploratory technique&#13;
to create the optimal number of groups of out-of-work market individuals with the most similar&#13;
characteristics.&#13;
The LCA model can be seen as a probabilistic or model-based variant of traditional non-&#13;
hierarchical cluster analysis procedures such as the K-means method. Contrary to traditional ad-&#13;
hoc clustering approaches, the LCA approach to clustering is model-based. Since persons in the&#13;
same latent class (cluster) cannot be distinguished from each other based on their observed&#13;
V3, 31-March 2015&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿responses, they are similar to each other (homogeneous) with respect to these observed variables.&#13;
Individuals are hence classified into the class for which they have the highest posterior probability&#13;
of belonging, given their observed characteristics.&#13;
LCA is thus most similar to the K-Means approach to cluster analysis in which cases that are&#13;
"close" to one of K centers are grouped together. In fact LCA can be viewed as a probabilistic&#13;
variant of K-Means clustering where probabilities are used to define "closeness" to each center. As&#13;
such, LCA provides a way not only to formalize the K-Means approach in terms of a statistical&#13;
model, but also to extend the K-Means approach in several directions: flexible distance to the&#13;
center of the cluster, determination of the optinal number of clusters, inclusion of categorical&#13;
variables, and inclusion of exogenous variables. First, while K-Means uses an ad-hoc distance&#13;
measure for classification, the LCA approach allows cases to be classified into clusters using model&#13;
based posterior membership probabilities estimated by maximum likelihood (ML) methods.&#13;
Second, LCA provides various diagnostics such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)&#13;
statistic, which helps determine the optimal number of clusters. Third, while K-Means clustering is&#13;
limited to interval scale quantitative variables for which Euclidean distance measures can be&#13;
calculated, LCA can be performed on variables of mixed metrics (continuous, categorical (nominal&#13;
or ordinal), or counts or any combination of these). Fourth, the LCA model can be easily extended&#13;
to include exogenous variables (covariates).&#13;
The LCA model with covariates can be written as:&#13;
f(Y/zj = Z p(x=k1zj)f(yjx=k)&#13;
Where y, is a vector of dependent (endogenous) indicators for individual i, z is a vector of&#13;
independent (exogenous) covariate for individual i, x is a nominal latent variable (and k denotes a&#13;
class, k=1,2,...,K), and f(yfx=k) denotes the joint distribution specified fory, given latent class x=k.&#13;
For continuous yi, the multivariate normal distribution is used with class-specific means. In&#13;
addition, the within-class covariance matrices can be assumed to be equal or unequal across&#13;
classes, and the local independence assumption can be relaxed by applying various structures to&#13;
the within-class covariance matrices. For variables of other/mixed scale types, local independence&#13;
among the variables imposes restrictions on second-order as well as to higher-order moments.&#13;
For the analysis of "Portraits of Labor Market Exclusion" (2013-2014), the out-of-work Individuals&#13;
constituted the population of interest The population was then restricted to working-age&#13;
population (individuals aged 16 to 64). As mentioned earlier, age categories, gender, education,&#13;
economic status, chronic illness and spouse working status represent the observed covariates and&#13;
were used to predict the inactivity status. In addition to these indicator and active covariates,&#13;
exogenous variables were included in the model, such as income quintile of household, household&#13;
composition, urban/rural breakdown, region, economic activity of the spouse, work intensity of&#13;
households and social protection transfers.&#13;
For each year, the LCA model wasrun with one to ten classes, leading to ten different estimations.&#13;
To determine the optimal number of clusters into which the population of interest should be&#13;
divided, we used two criteria that maximize the cohesion within clusters and the distance between&#13;
clusters: the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion (AIC and BIC).&#13;

ï»¿3. Activity Components&#13;
Building on the layout of the major logical phases of 'Portraits 2.0' in section 2.1, this section will&#13;
describe the exact activity flow and the high-level interaction model for analytics and policy&#13;
dialogue between,&#13;
* EC DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (Horizontal Unit and Country Desks),&#13;
* The Member States and their Government agencies / institutions,&#13;
* The World Bank (and OECD).&#13;
The "Portraits 2.0" activity aims to begin as early as possible in 2015 (joint and concurrent&#13;
effectiveness of the two administrative and financing agreements between the EC and the World&#13;
Bank and the OECD respectively) and deliver comprehensive results in 2016. The World Bank and&#13;
the OECD will enter into a "Memorandum of Understanding" which gives a detailed account of the&#13;
distribution and timing of the activities. Together with the timeline (Annex 1), this constitutes the&#13;
base material for the respective Administrative and Grant Agreements between the EC and the&#13;
World Bank and the OECD, which will be the legally binding documents for output delivery and&#13;
execution.&#13;
The following table describes the different activity elements in more detail, and the outputs and&#13;
timeline associated with them. The respective legal agreements will differentiate the exact&#13;
responsibilities in case they are concurrent or joint (e.g. 6:6 Member States for the cluster analysis).&#13;

ï»¿4. Administrative and Legal Framework&#13;
With the expression of interest on the part of EC DG EMPL, to involve both World Bank and OECD as&#13;
activity partners in the work of 'Portraits 2.0', an appropriate administrative and financial holding&#13;
environment for the analytical and policy dialogue work will need to be created. The chosen&#13;
structure should reflect the fact that all organizations involved are international organizations, have&#13;
a long standing cooperative work history and do not pursue for-profit motives in their actions.&#13;
The suggested administrative and legal structure is presented below. The EC would enter into two&#13;
separate Administrative Agreements with the World Bank and the OECD. The World Bank and the&#13;
OECD will enter into a Memorandum of Understanding, referencing the planned delivery schedule&#13;
and partition of work. Both organizations will ensure the overall project management,&#13;
methodological coordination and delivery on time and on budget of the agreed activities.&#13;
The World Bank and the OECD, but also the project partners in the EC, would commit to a once-per&#13;
month project management meeting (via audio / VC and through live meetings), in which the state&#13;
of the project, necessary next steps, possible remedial actions and possible conflicts are discussed,&#13;
documented and resolved.&#13;

The total budget estimated for this task by the EC DG EMPL is EUR 800,000. A breakdown of the&#13;
costs to be incurred is provided below, including the proposed division of resources between the&#13;
OECD and the World Bank, following the agreed division of work between the two organizations.&#13;
The respective administration fees will be applied proportionally across all items of the respective&#13;
organization's budget&#13;
Imbalances in the proposed financing contribution (e.g. higher volume for "b. Joint Methodology&#13;
Paper" for OECD than for World Bank, higher volume for World Bank on "j. Follow-up capacity&#13;
building and policy seminars") does not imply a component leadership. Final budget allocations are&#13;
subject to the Administrative Agreements concluded between the European Commission and the&#13;
respective organizations (World Bank and OECD).&#13;
