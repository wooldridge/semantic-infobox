&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success&#13;
factorsâ&#128;&#153; selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systemsâ&#128;&#148;in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the African&#13;
Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
   Urban water supply&#13;
   â&#128;¢	   Implement cost recovery policies by strengthening capacity and financial autonomy of town utilities.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	   Increase focus on water resource sustainability through encouragement of demand management approaches and&#13;
        reduction in unaccounted-for water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Implement sanitation and hygiene component of the national WASH inventory to establish baseline data.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Develop a strategic national action plan for sanitation, with time-bound and budgeted activities, as has been done&#13;
      for the water supply sector.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Develop a national guideline for Community-Led Total Sanitation and Hygiene, to define the conceptual framework&#13;
      for all actors in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Urban sanitation and hygiene&#13;
   â&#128;¢	   Formulate a clear Urban Sanitation Strategy, including delineation of responsibilities between different government&#13;
        agencies, an investment program, and financing strategy. This is needed to set out urban sanitation hardware&#13;

1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 AMCOW delegated&#13;
this task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank (AfDB), which are&#13;
implementing it in close partnership with UNICEF and the WHO in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has&#13;
been produced in collaboration with the Government of Ethiopia and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

All sources confirm that water supply coverage in Ethiopia is on                (PASDEP-2) in 2010, these targets were adjusted slightly&#13;
a strong upward trajectory. According to official government                    to 98.5 percent coverage, and the target date extended to&#13;
data, water supply coverage has risen from 19 percent in                        2015.5 These are still well above the MDG targets.&#13;
1990 (11 percent rural, 70 percent urban) to 66 percent&#13;
in 2009 (62 percent rural, 89 percent urban).3 As Figure 1                      Investment Requirements: Testing the&#13;
shows, based on the official government data, Ethiopia has                      Sufficiency of Finance&#13;
already met the MDG target of 60 percent.4 Estimates of&#13;
current coverage from the international Joint Monitoring                        Although past trends in coverage are an important&#13;
Programme (JMP) are significantly more cautious, due to a                       determinant for whether Ethiopia will meet its targets,&#13;
range of factors (see Box 1). Nevertheless, the JMP data still                  recently there has also been a significant increase in&#13;
portray a remarkable increase in coverage of over 1 million                     financial resources committed to the sector. If this&#13;
people per year (1990â&#128;&#147;2008). For sanitation, performance is                     continues, increased investments could accelerate the&#13;
less promising, although figures from the Ethiopian Ministry                    progress projected in the above charts. However, increasing&#13;
of Health show an increase to 39 percent coverage by 2009                       coverage will also correspond to increasing rehabilitation&#13;
(30 percent rural, 88 percent urban) from a baseline of close                   costs, and it will be important that these are accurately&#13;
to zero in 1990.                                                                factored into budget projections.&#13;

National targets for Ethiopia are embedded in the Universal                     The required investment costs presented for water supply&#13;

     JMP versus national coverage data in Ethiopia                        water supply, the costing model for sanitation has been&#13;

     â&#128;¢	 Lack of recent household surveys available                        Using the CSO2 costing model, the estimates of capital&#13;

        result, the JMP does not capture the recent                       anticipated public CAPEX and the assumed contribution&#13;
        acceleration of coverage which is believed                        from households, based on user contribution policy&#13;
        to have occurred as a result of increased                         (Figure 2). Investment requirements for operations and&#13;
        government and donor investment. In                               maintenance (OPEX) are assessed separately (Table 2). It&#13;
        addition, even if more up-to-date, positive                       should be noted that the CSO2 model predicts somewhat&#13;
        household survey data were available, this                        higher OPEX costs than under the PASDEP-2 budget.&#13;

required to achieve the government UAP target, resulting                        In addition, a needs assessment of institutional sanitation&#13;
in an annual CAPEX deficit of around US$24 million.                             in 2007 estimated the costs of sanitation for existing&#13;
                                                                                schools and health facilities to be an additional US$510&#13;
The picture for sanitation is very different, due to the                        million.7&#13;
national policy of increasing coverage through promotion&#13;
of sanitation and hygiene behavioral change, rather than                        In terms of anticipated public investment for sanitation,&#13;
by offering public subventions for household sanitation                         precise estimates of financial commitments are&#13;
facilities. The model is aligned with this general policy:                      problematic, as program budgets do not always&#13;
due to the low current coverage levels, total investment                        differentiate between water and sanitation investments.&#13;
requirements for sanitation hardware are estimated to                           However, a rough estimate puts the total anticipated&#13;
be US$795 million per annumâ&#128;&#148;all of which is expected                            investment at around US$50 million per year. The majority&#13;

admitted that this is a somewhat simplified picture. First,                     via the recurrent budget invested in the promotional&#13;
some donor programs subsidize household sanitation                              activities of Health Extension Workers (HEWs) and via&#13;
in the case of vulnerable groups, but there is limited                          donor programs. This will be essential if households are&#13;
information on the amounts involved. Second, the policy                         to be persuaded to finance and build their own facilities,&#13;
suggests that public capital investment will be required                        as the policy requires. The CSO2 model does not provide&#13;
for major urban sewerage works. Around US$18 million                            an estimate of the level of investment required for&#13;
per year is budgeted by the Ministry of Water Resources                         such â&#128;&#152;softwareâ&#128;&#153; with which to compare this anticipated&#13;

these costs will ultimately be fully recovered under the zero                   sewerage in Addis Ababa (outside of the capital, the low&#13;

3.	 Reform Context:&#13;
	 Introducing the CSO2 Scorecard&#13;
&#13;
The current era of reform in Ethiopia began in the early       the MDGs. The National Water Resources Management&#13;
1990s, with the establishment of the present system of         Policy (1998) and Strategy (2000) provide guidance&#13;
government. Prior to that, there was little in the way         for investments in rural and urban water supply and&#13;
of policies or programs to address water and sanitation        sanitation. The sector has also been given high priority in&#13;
needs; the current government, therefore, inherited a          the most recent Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP),&#13;
legacy of inadequate water and sanitation infrastructure,      the Plan for Accelerated and Sustainable Development to&#13;
as recorded in the very low coverage levels at the beginning   End Poverty (PASDEP), with budget allocations increasing&#13;
of the 1990s.                                                  to some extent to match the heightened political&#13;
                                                               commitment (although it appears not sufficiently to meet&#13;
The historical context helps to understand the current         targets). In 2005, this commitment was extended through&#13;
state of the service delivery pathway, which is explored       the proclamation of the UAP, which laid out a plan for&#13;

development of their water supply services. Meanwhile,&#13;
the MoWR was established in 1995 and, in relation to&#13;
water supply and sanitation, was primarily tasked with&#13;
policy, coordination, and regulatory functions. This was&#13;
followed by a second wave of decentralization beginning&#13;
in 2004, with responsibilities for basic service delivery&#13;
being further devolved to the district (or woreda) level,&#13;
although regional government continues to provide&#13;
districts with significant technical support, especially for&#13;
more complex technologies.                                                  Sustaining                      Developing&#13;

The delivery of basic services through a highly decentralized     Local government: Ensuring and sustaining&#13;
system in a large, heavily populated, and predominantly           capacity. Each local government in Ethiopia contains a&#13;
rural country is not without its challenges. Over recent          â&#128;&#152;Woreda WASH Teamâ&#128;&#153; responsible for all aspects of water&#13;
years, significant progress has been made towards                 and sanitation development in the district, including&#13;
establishing the basic institutional arrangements in the          management and oversight of scheme construction,&#13;
water and sanitation sector to make this possible. This has       provision of maintenance support, financial management,&#13;
included the progressive devolution of implementation             and M&amp;E. This local mandate is expected to expand in&#13;
responsibilities to regional and woreda level; the shift          the face of a renewed focus on low-cost technologies&#13;
of sector financial management responsibilities from the          and self-supply. Most woreda offices, however, lack&#13;
sectors to the ministry and regional bureaus of finance           sufficient human resources and operational budgets to&#13;
and economic development; and the ongoing effort                  effectively perform even their current role. Based on a&#13;

all remain â&#128;&#152;works in progressâ&#128;&#153; and therefore, to a large          US$200 per staff member per year, insufficient to cover&#13;
extent, the priority now should be to not engage in new           even the expenses required for 10 days of local travel to&#13;
reforms but to embed and continue to strengthen the               field sites.13 Support from donor programs is widespread&#13;
nascent institutional structures in the sector. Ethiopia          but lacks coordination, particularly in relation to capacity&#13;
records strong scores for all related indicators, nationally      building, and is not a sustainable method for financing&#13;
recognized targets and subsector policies, as well as             recurrent costs. There is also no clear picture of the&#13;
clearly designated institutional roles. It is ahead of its peer   scale or content of the optimal â&#128;&#152;packageâ&#128;&#153; of capacity&#13;

ongoing thematic challenges have been identified.                 to operational budgets (for staff the objective is 11â&#128;&#147;13&#13;

Scorecard indicators relating to institutional                    operational funds further). With over 700 woredas in the&#13;
framework, with average of indicator scores by                    country, there is no easy solution, but the development&#13;

financed by a wide variety of different funding mechanisms.     through the block grant system under the Protection of&#13;
Rural water supply in particular is supported by almost         Basic Services (PBS) program. Increased financial resources&#13;
every conceivable combination and permutation of                have, in turn, heightened the importance of establishing&#13;
development assistance, from national programs financed         effective sector financing mechanisms. As can be seen&#13;

using innovative approaches and direct project financing        while good progress is being made, challenges remain in&#13;
mechanisms. Donor funding for urban water supply and            relation to the harmonization and alignment of finance in&#13;
sewerage is more standardized, being principally financed       the sector:&#13;
by standalone project lending and by on-lending to&#13;
utilities from the Water Resource Development Fund. The         Donor financing: Reducing fragmentation. While&#13;

Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s population is predominantly rural, and therefore                Recent increases in investment finance imply that&#13;
the level of success in increasing coverage in rural areas                 anticipated CAPEX for rural water supply, of US$114&#13;

barrier to service delivery and a priority for reform (score&#13;

environment, especially in policy and planning where much&#13;
of the foundation has already been laid. Budgets have&#13;
also increased substantially over recent years, a result both&#13;
of increasing government block grants to regions and&#13;
woredas, and growth in donor commitments, including a&#13;

The lower sustaining scores reflect the challenge of fully&#13;

response to this challenge has been the recent strategic shift    Building blocks relating to developing scores are also&#13;

 In Ethiopia, the Health Extension Program represents a far-                    towards advocacy for appropriate low cost technologies,&#13;
 reaching initiative to bring health services to all Ethiopians                 and education to promote changes in sanitation and&#13;
 through the deployment of around 30,000 HEWs.                                  hygiene practices. While capital requirements to meet&#13;
 Although the program has faced challenges in terms of                          the UAP target are significant (US$692 million per year)&#13;
 finance and the scale of the tasks expected from the HEWs,                     these are designated as household responsibilities. The&#13;
 notable progress has been made in improving sanitation                         anticipated public expenditure of around US$30 million&#13;
 and hygiene coverage at the grassroots level. According to                     per year is currently intended for institutional sanitation&#13;
 government figures (which relax the definition of improved                     (schools and health posts), and promotion (US$7 million&#13;
 facilities) coverage had reached 37 percent in 2008. JMP                       from government sources, primarily HEW salaries, and&#13;
 figures show a gradual increase in both improved and                           US$23 million per year from donor sources, based on&#13;
 shared facilities, though to a lower level of 8 percent for                    current financial commitments). However, as noted earlier,&#13;
 improved facilities alone.                                                     due to difficulties in extracting sanitation budgets from&#13;
                                                                                combined water and sanitation programs, these should&#13;
 The government has been a strong proponent of zero                             be recognized as estimates only. Furthermore, given the&#13;

           Priority actions for urban sanitation and hygiene&#13;
           â&#128;¢	    Formulate a clear Urban Sanitation Strategy, including delineation of responsibilities between different&#13;
                 government agencies, an investment program and financing strategy. This is needed to set out urban&#13;
                 sanitation hardware requirements, technology choices and how they will be financed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The state of urban sanitation in Ethiopia differs substantially                million per year, will be met by households. Anticipated&#13;
 depending on coverage estimates used. Based on the JMP                         public spending of around US$19 million per year will go&#13;
 definition of improved facilities, urban coverage is only                      to sewerage infrastructure, institutional sanitation, and&#13;
 29 percent (with a higher number using shared facilities),                     promotion work. However, as noted for the rural subsector&#13;
 while government figures, which include a broader                              there are serious questions over whether, in the absence&#13;
 range of sanitation facilities in the coverage estimate                        of direct spending on infrastructure, the government is&#13;
 (such as traditional pit latrines), estimate coverage as 88                    commensurately resourcing promotion to encourage&#13;
 percent. The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s definition of sanitation, and its                    households to install or upgrade their facilities.&#13;
 consequent estimate of coverage, would appear to put its&#13;
 target of 98.5 percent coverage in reach.                                      Irrespective of coverage figures used, urban sanitation&#13;
                                                                                would appear to be a priority subsector for reform based&#13;
 Again, a policy of zero subsidy for sanitation hardware at                     on the low scorecard results (Figure 22). The enabling&#13;
 the household level in theory removes the responsibility                       environment should be the starting point, particularly&#13;
 for CAPEX financing from governmentâ&#128;&#148;as Figure 21                               planning and budgeting where Ethiopia scores very low&#13;
 shows, the assumption is that the entire amount, US$102                        on the scorecard, due to a lack of consistent coordination,&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Ethiopia :
            turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The African Ministers' Council on
            Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round
            of Country Status Overviews (CSOs2) to better understands
            what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and
            what its member governments can do to accelerate that
            progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW
            delegated this task to the World Bank's Water and
            Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank (AfDB),
            which are implementing it in close partnership with United
            Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health
            Organization (WHO) in over 30 countries across SSA. This
            CSO2 report has been produced in collaboration with the
            Government of Ethiopia and other stakeholders during
            2009-10. The analysis aims to help countries assess their
            own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water
            supply and sanitation services in each of four subsectors:
            rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban
            sanitation, and hygiene. The CSO2 analysis has three main
            components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to
            assess the adequacy of future investments; and a scorecard
            which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the
            service delivery pathway. The CSO2's contribution is to
            answer not only whether past trends and future finance are
            sufficient to meet sector targets, but what specific issues
            need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned
            into accelerated coverage in water supply and sanitation. In
            this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified
            through consultation. A synthesis report, available
            separately, presents best practice and shared learning to
            help realize these priority actions.
