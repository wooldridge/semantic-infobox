ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper describes the characteristics of the population of Bogota:&#13;
who are the people, what are their characteristics, what they do and where do&#13;
they live on the basis of a detailed examination of several primary data&#13;
sources. It also places the development of Bogota in a historical and national&#13;
context in order to provide a better understanding of currently existing patterns.&#13;
Bogota has gone through a phase of extremely rapid urbanization over the past&#13;
half century during which it has grown more than ten fold. The data on fertility&#13;
rates, trends in the participation of women in the labor force and indications&#13;
of a recent slow down in the rate of growth of Bogota suggest that the next&#13;
decade will see Bogota growing much more slowly. The demographic structure of&#13;
the city is much like that of other Latin American cities: it has a high pro-&#13;
portion of women, as well as children under 15 years of age, the latter com-&#13;
prising more than 40% of the population. Thus, the labor force of Bogota can&#13;
be expected to continue to expand at high rates even after the population growth&#13;
slows down. The city has a balanced economic structure which is not dominated&#13;
by manufacturing, nor services nor administration, as it is in some other large&#13;
cities of the world. As the city has grown and its area has grown, the largest&#13;
growth in population has occurred in the outer rings, while the inner rings&#13;
have not declined. Thus, Bogota now has high density all over except in the&#13;
outermost rings. Income varies much more by radial sectors than by rings:&#13;
the poor in Bogota live in the Southern sector of the city and incomes increase&#13;
roughly as one moves clockwise toward the North.&#13;
Migrants in Bogota are not especially poor; they do not concentrate&#13;
in specific areas of the city--the centre or the periphery; they are not con-&#13;
centrated in particular occupations nor activities; they are not less educated&#13;
nor less skilled than the natives. Such ideas are counter to the popular&#13;
notion of poor migrants streaming into the city. Bogota is quite centralized&#13;
in employment where the centre appears to have about a quarter of all employ-&#13;
ment. The poor areas of the city have a net deficit of jobs as compared&#13;
with residences while the rich North has a corresponding surplus. There is&#13;
relatively little in-commuting to the South. People living in the poor South&#13;
are, in that sense, spatially disadvantaged. The distinctions between the&#13;
sectors become more apparent when the age-education-income profiles of workers&#13;
are examined. As one would expect, people with less education have flatter&#13;
income profiles than those with more. People in the poorer sectors have&#13;
relatively flat income profiles and even people with higher education in these&#13;
sectors earn less than those with similar levels of education in richer&#13;
sectors. Workers with similar occupations and activity appear to receive&#13;
different incomes according to sector of residence. Thus, it may be hypo-&#13;
thesized that in addition to the standard earnings determinants, the place of&#13;
residence in a city may have some bearing on a person's potential earnings.&#13;
The paper also examines carefully the quality of the data sets used&#13;
and technical appendices are provided on some problems in the use of primary&#13;
data such as household surveys.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1       Context of This Study&#13;
This paper forms part of a large program of research grouped&#13;
under the rubric of the "City Study" of Bogota, Colombia, being conducted&#13;
at the World Bank. The goal of the City Study is to increase our under-&#13;
standing of the workings and interactions of five major urban sectors -&#13;
housing, transport, employment location, labor markets and the public&#13;
sector - so that the impacts of policies and projects in urban areas can&#13;
be assessed more accurately. The study emphasizes the conditions of low&#13;
income households in terms of employment opportunities, housing consumption&#13;
and the level of public services available to them. The program of research&#13;
has three distinct phases: description, hypothesis testing and estimation&#13;
of behavioral parameters, and the development of policy impact models. This&#13;
paper is the first of the labor market studies and forms part of the first&#13;
phase - description - and will be followed by studies somewhat more analytical&#13;
in nature.&#13;
1.2       Objectives&#13;
The aim of this paper is to describe the characteristics of the&#13;
population of Bogota: who are the people, what are their characteristics,&#13;
what do they do and where do they live. It also attempts to place the&#13;
development of Bogota in a historical and national context in order to&#13;
provide a better understanding of currently existing patterns. Thus, it&#13;
serves as an introduction to the city of Bogota and, in some sense, lays&#13;
out some of the phenomena requiring explanation. As in the City Study as&#13;
a whole particular attention is paid to spatial arrangements within the&#13;
city. Do frictions of space matter in the workings of the urban labor&#13;
market in a large city? There is currently a great amount of concern being&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
expressed by policy makers within developing countries on the size of their&#13;
largest cities. It is therefore important to examine the state of income,&#13;
employment and unemployment in these cities and to see if the "largeness"&#13;
of the city matters.&#13;
The study of labor markets in urban areas of less developed&#13;
countries has essentially been conducted under the umbrella of three sets&#13;
of distinct though related ideas. The first is a concern with the effects&#13;
and causes of migration to urban areas and their respective consequences&#13;
on labor markets at both the issuing and receiving ends.-/ The second set&#13;
of studies explore the extent of the validity of the human capital model&#13;
2/&#13;
of labor earnings in developing countries.-    The third set of studies re-&#13;
flect a dualistic model of thinking where the urban labor market is looked&#13;
at as being composed of formal and informal sectors.-/ The connecting&#13;
thread between these three sets is an underlying preoccupation with the&#13;
causes of poverty. A composite picture of the conclusions drawn from such&#13;
work which may be characterized as currently received wisdom is as follows.&#13;
The human capital model which essentially explains the variation in earnings&#13;
by investments in education and on-the-job experience "works" but&#13;
characteristically accounts for 30 to 45 percent of the observed variation&#13;
of incomes in less developed countries.&#13;
1/ See, for example, Harris and Todaro (1970), Mazumdar (1976b)&#13;
Todaro (1976a,b), Yap (1977).&#13;
2/  See, for example, Fields (1977, 1978), Jallade (1974),Psacharopoulos (1973).&#13;
3/  See Mazumdar (1976a), Joshi et al C1976), Lubell (1974), Merrick (1978),&#13;
Sethuraman (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
The rest is explained either by positing other systematic economic&#13;
variables that are not easily measurable such as skill; or by positing&#13;
structural imperfections which impede the functioning of the market, such&#13;
as labor welfare regulations; or by positing the existence of merely&#13;
stochastic processes which reward some and not others. The formal/informal&#13;
sector proponents opt for the structural imperfection explanation and assert&#13;
the existence of a "protected" sector which "artificially" keeps wages high&#13;
in one sector and restricts entry to newcomers. Appeal is also made to the&#13;
"experience" variable which suggests that the new entrants are migrants who&#13;
are the least experienced in more ways than one. They therefore constitute&#13;
a major part of the informal sector acquiring experience, skills and pass-&#13;
ports to entry in the form of certification before they can penetrate the&#13;
curtain of the protected sector.&#13;
This paper finds merit in most of the above ideas but suggests&#13;
that a further understanding of the operation of labor markets can only come&#13;
through a more explicit recognition of heterogeneity in the characteristics&#13;
of the labor force and, possibly, in the preferences of the constituents as&#13;
well. This is an attempt to step back somewhat and explore descriptively&#13;
further possibilities of taxonomy that might aid analysis of urban labor&#13;
market behavior. The main additional dimension examined here is that of&#13;
spatial differences within the urban area of a large city'. Are workers&#13;
living in one part of a city disadvantaged (or advantaged) by virtue of&#13;
their location? How homogeneous are different sectors of a city with respect&#13;
to labor force characteristics? How useful is such a classification to&#13;
understanding the operation of urban labor markets? In addition data sources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
are examined in some detail to comment on problems associated with i) the&#13;
use of sample surveys of households for the purpose of drawing strong&#13;
conclusions and ii) using a series of surveys for examining time trends.&#13;
These problems are associated with the existence of systematic differences&#13;
between different areas of a city and their changing character over time in&#13;
a high growth situation. If the systematic differences are known, the&#13;
drawing of a random stratified sample poses no problem: but if the sample&#13;
itself is used to infer the existence of these differences then the problems&#13;
posed begin to be more intractable.&#13;
1.3       Summary of the Paper&#13;
Colombia has gone through a phase of extremely rapid urbanization&#13;
over the past half century but is unusual among Latin American countries&#13;
in that it has a relatively well articulated system of cities not entirely&#13;
dominated by one large metropolitan city. Bogota itself has enjoyed a long&#13;
period of uninterrupted growth and grown ten fold over the past fifty years.&#13;
It is likely, however, that growth rates of Bogota and other large cities&#13;
will continue their recent slow down and Bogota will not be as large in 1990&#13;
as had been expected in the past. Despite this long period of growth it&#13;
appears that Bogota has kept a relatively stable gross density of population:&#13;
it has expanded in area about as much as in population. Compared to other&#13;
cities in the world, Bogota is relatively densely inhabited though less so&#13;
than some Asian cities.&#13;
The demographic structure of the city is much like that of other&#13;
Latin American cities: it has a higher proportion of w'omen as well as&#13;
children under 15 years of age, the latter comprising more than 40 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of the population. Thus we can expect the labour force in Bogota to con-&#13;
tinue to expand at high rates even after the population growth rate slows&#13;
down. In recent years, despite the expansion in the labour force, the&#13;
measured unemployment rate has been declining to what might be called&#13;
internationally acceptable rates. The city has a balanced economic structure&#13;
which is not dominated by manufacturing nor services nor administration as&#13;
it is in some other large cities in the world. As the city has grown and&#13;
its area has expanded, the largest growth in population has occurred in&#13;
the outer rings. The inner rings, however, have had a relatively stable&#13;
population unlike North American central cities which have tended to lose&#13;
population as they have decentralized. The result in Bogota is that it&#13;
now has high density all over except in the outermost rings. The South of&#13;
the city is much more densely populated as well as much poorer than the&#13;
North.&#13;
Given normal data sources it is difficult to arrive at a robust&#13;
estimate of the proportions of workers working in small and large firms.&#13;
Different data sources give inconsistent estimates. It can, however,&#13;
safely be said that large manufacturing firms (those employing more than&#13;
five employees) account for at least 50 percent of all manufacturing&#13;
employment; large commerce firms for about 30 percent of commerce employ-&#13;
ment and large service firms for about 30-45 percent. The inconsistencies&#13;
between data sets point to the hazards of calculating the size of the&#13;
"informal sector" which is usually said to comprise workers in the&#13;
unorganized sector. Further it is found that a large majority of all&#13;
workers falling in the bottom 30 percent by income rankings are male&#13;
secondary workers or women--categories of workers usually assigned to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
the "informal sector." Underemployment is not as extensive as is often&#13;
suspected: Not more than three or four percent of the workers are under-&#13;
employed in the sense that they work fewer than 30 hours a week and would&#13;
like more work, those working few hours and looking for extra work are&#13;
predominantly construction or production workers and not workers in the&#13;
service sector as may have been expected. Those in the service sector&#13;
are over-represented in the over-worked low income category. The charac-&#13;
teristics of the labour force are therefore so complex that it is difficult&#13;
to easily delineate a sector which can then be termed an "informal sector."&#13;
An examination of the distribution of workers by area of residence&#13;
reveals some interesting patterns. Dividing Bogota into eight pie-slices&#13;
or sectors, each of the eight sectors differed from the others according&#13;
to the incomes of workers. Overall, women are found to earn about half as&#13;
much as men but the ratio is somewhat higher in the poorer parts of the&#13;
city. This is partly because a large proportion of the female labour&#13;
force, almost a third, work as maids while there are few men in this low&#13;
income occupation. It is also the case that there are few women in higher&#13;
income occupations and those who are there earn proportionately less.&#13;
Bogota is found to be quite centralized in employment: the center&#13;
or central business district has about a quarter of all employment as com-&#13;
pared to about 10 to 15 percent for a typical North American city. The&#13;
density of employment in the center is very high but it then declines&#13;
exponentially as one moves to the periphery. The poor areas of the city&#13;
located mainly in the South have a net deficit of jobs as compared with&#13;
residences while the rich North has a corresponding surplus. Consequently&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
the poor South has very little in-commuting and is therefore somewhat&#13;
delinked from the rest of the city.   People living in the poor South are,&#13;
in that sense, spatially disadvantaged.&#13;
The distinctions between the sectors become more apparent when&#13;
the age - education - income profiles of workers are examined. As one would&#13;
expect, people with less education have flatter income profiles than those&#13;
with more. But what is interesting is that the poorer sectors have&#13;
relatively flat profiles and that even people with higher education in&#13;
these sectors 'earn less than those with similar levels of education in the&#13;
richer sectors. This provides further evidence that workers living in&#13;
poorer sectors are disadvantaged. Whether residence in poor areas of the&#13;
city causes or reinforces poverty is not tested here: only'the correla-&#13;
tions are clear. Only a multivariate model framework could begin to&#13;
disentangle the various effects on income. At this stage, the idea that&#13;
place of residence has a bearing on potential earnings (or permanent&#13;
income) remains a mere hypothesis, but one worth testing systematically.&#13;
Migrants are found to be distributed uniformly all over:&#13;
they are not over-represented in the periphery and only mildly so in the&#13;
center. They are not found to be poorer either: indeed, recent&#13;
immigrants appear to earn more than those of somewhat longer standing.&#13;
Conventionally wisdom is therefore not supported on either of these points.&#13;
Production workers are found to be among the least paid members of the&#13;
labour force along with the low paid service workers, the variance of&#13;
income being much higher among the latter. Thus the majority of production&#13;
workers are found in the poorer sectors of the city. Workers with similar&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
occupatiol,s and activity appear to receive different incomes according to&#13;
sector of residence.&#13;
Much attention is denoted in the paper to reliability of data.&#13;
Emphasis is made on the point that data users should pay more attention&#13;
to the mode of collection of the data and on the sampling frames used.&#13;
Strong conclusions from single samples should be eschewed until corroborated&#13;
from comparable data sources.&#13;
1.4       A Reader's Guide&#13;
After this introduction, the next section puts Bogota in the&#13;
national context and reviews in brief the urbanization experience of Colombia.&#13;
The next section describes the data sources used in the paper and the basic&#13;
spatial classification system used by these sources. Section IV gives a&#13;
historical background to the development of Bogota and then examines the&#13;
spatial distribution of population and income within the city. This section&#13;
also discusses some of the sampling problems posed above in relation to&#13;
observed differences in the incomes and population distributions over space&#13;
and time periods in the city. The rest of the paper, in sections V and VI,&#13;
then maps the characteristics of the labor force according to the standard&#13;
classifications of age, sex, education, migrant status, occupation, activity,&#13;
position in household and hours worked, but all disaggregated spatially.&#13;
The firm size distribution divided between large (those employing more than&#13;
5 employees) and small firms is also examined in Section V. Information is&#13;
also given on the comparative distribution of work and residence locations&#13;
around the city.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The mapping of such a profile necessitates the use of a rather large&#13;
number of tables which can be tedious to digest. Graphical and map representa-&#13;
tions are used wherever useful but many tables are presented here in order to&#13;
highlight the variation or heterogeneity that exists in the labor force but&#13;
which tends to get clouded by graphical representations or the estimation of&#13;
equations. A more sophisticated approach would use analysis of variance or&#13;
other similar techniques to characterize heterogeneity in a more summary and&#13;
readily digestible manner. But I believe that the somewhat raw tables pre-&#13;
sented here are essential for an appreciation of the texture of the pattern&#13;
that exists. Finally, the concluding section generates hypotheses concerning&#13;
the operation of the urban labor markets associated with the spatial structure&#13;
of the city.&#13;
Given the concern in this paper with data problems and the&#13;
mechanics of data generation, three technical appendices are also included&#13;
at the end. Appendix 1 outlines a method for imputing incomes to indi-&#13;
viduals who do not provide income information--a problem encountered often&#13;
in surveys and censuses. Appendix 2 illustrates how the coverage of personal&#13;
income in a census or survey can be compared with national or regional&#13;
income accounts: this is done for the 1973 and 1977 sources used. Appendix&#13;
3 outlines the method used for expanding the Population Census Sample Public&#13;
Use Tape to obtain an estimate of the population of Bogota in 1973.&#13;

II. BOGOTA IN THE NATIONAL URBAN CONTEXT&#13;
This section attempts to place Bogota within a wider national&#13;
context to set the stage for a study of income and employment within the&#13;
city. Map 1 shows the location of Bogota within Colombia which is unusual&#13;
among Latin American countries in that it has a well articulated system of&#13;
cities. Bogota comprises only about 20 percent of the total urban population.&#13;
Its primacy index-/ is the lowest among all countries in Latin America except&#13;
for Brazil.- Thus, while Bogota is the dominant city in Colombia it is not&#13;
as dominant as the largest cities in other Latin American cities. However,&#13;
its share of both population as well as output as a proportion of the country&#13;
has been increasing over the past few decades.&#13;
Table (2.la) shows the growth rate of population in the country&#13;
as a whole as well as for Bogota. It is clear from the table that the&#13;
country has undergone a rather rapid process of urbanization during the&#13;
past forty years. The period from 1951 to 1964 saw an especially rapid&#13;
increase in population of the country as a whole as well as in the rate&#13;
of urbanization. Within the space of forty years Colombia has gone from&#13;
being a predominantly rural country to a predominantly urban one. In 1938&#13;
about 70 percent of the country's inhabitants lived in rural areas while&#13;
now the proportions are almost reversed: in 1973 60 percent of the people&#13;
lived in urban areas. In this process Bogota itself has increased its&#13;
share of the population from under 4 percent to over 12 percent of the&#13;
country as a whole. The city has had a sustained rate of populatton growth&#13;

population of the country.&#13;

of over 5 percent a year for the remarkably long period of almost half a century.&#13;
It has increased from a population of about 330,000 to about 3.5 million in&#13;
40 years: a tenfold increase! It is difficult to imagine that Bogota,&#13;
the capital of the country was the same size in 1938 as an "intermediate" size&#13;
city like Bucaramanga is today.&#13;
Table 2.1(b) gives the trends of the gross domestic products&#13;
for Colombia and Bogota since 1950. This analysis is made possible because&#13;
the National Planning Department (Departamento Nacional de Planeacion)&#13;
recently compiled regional income accounts for all the departamentos&#13;
(states) for Colombia and regarded Bogota as one of the units. Since 1960,&#13;
while Bogota increased its share of the national product from 15 percent&#13;
to 21 percent its per capita product as a proportion of the per capita&#13;
national product decreased from 1.8 to 1.6. This would indicate that the&#13;
rest of country/Bogota differential and, perhaps, the rural/urban income&#13;
differential has indeed been declining over the past two decades. While&#13;
data are not available it would be interesting to investigate if these&#13;
differentials were even greater during earlier periods when the process of&#13;
urbanization picked up speed in the 1930s. While the growth rate of&#13;
regional product of Bogota, 7 percent per year, is appreciably higher&#13;
than that for Colombia, 5.2 percent, for the third quarter of the century&#13;
1950-1975, the per capita growth rate is much less: 0.6 percent as com-&#13;
pared with 2.1 percent per year. These data are indicative of a great&#13;
amount of labor mobility arising from the existence of large wage&#13;
differentials between Bogota and the rest of the country. A closer look&#13;

at the regional accounts reveals the ratio of personal income per capita&#13;
*(as distinguished from per capita gross product) in Bogota compared with&#13;
the country as a whole declined even more: from 1.78 to 1.53. If these&#13;
data can be relied on, they do indicate the workings of an equilibrating&#13;
labor market. If price differentials are accounted for it may be the&#13;
case that the current money differential is no longer a significant real&#13;
income differential and we can then expect a drastic slow down in the&#13;
rate of urbanization and migration.&#13;
Table 2.2 provides a slightly more detailed picture of the process&#13;
of urbanization in Colombia. What is clear is that Bogota has grown con-&#13;
sistently faster than cities in other categories and that the next group,&#13;
Cali, Medellin and Barranquilla have grown somewhat less fast but more so&#13;
than smaller cities. Appendix tables A.2.1 and A.2.2 provide populations&#13;
and growth rates for all the thirty largest cities. There are intermediate&#13;
cities like Buenaventura, Cucuta, Yillavicencio, Valledupar and Bucaramanga&#13;
which have also grown fast but the urbanization process has been such that&#13;
the population has become more concentrated in the largest 4 cities in&#13;
Colombia and in particular in Bogota. Table 2.2 indicates that prior to&#13;
1964 the different size-classes of towns grew almost proportionately and&#13;
that increasing concentration took place only in the late sixties. As a&#13;
result there has been great concern expressed in Colombia in recent years&#13;
over the increasing size of Bogota.&#13;
These phenomena should be placed in the overall economic context&#13;
of Colombia. The post World War II period in Colombia can be divided into&#13;
3 phases: "effervescent growth" (1946-56),i/ stagnation (1956-65) and&#13;

of this work.&#13;

The periods of growth and stagnation are essentially correlated&#13;
with the country's terms of trade and especially the movement of world&#13;
coffee prices. The early post World War II period was characterized by a&#13;
consolidation of the growth of the industrial sector begun during the war&#13;
and aided by the availability of substantial foreign reserves. The urban&#13;
demand for labor rose as a consequence leading to the high urbanization&#13;
rates. The world coffee price fell dramatically in 1956 and remained there&#13;
until the mid sixties and income per capita remained almost constant.&#13;
However, migration to urban areas continued apace, in part because of&#13;
"la violencia" in rural Colombia.-/   Unemployment in urban areas began to&#13;
be perceived as a major problem during this time, along with high inflation.&#13;
Along with these changes the distribution of the labor force over activities&#13;

These data reveal the nature of the dramatic urbanization which&#13;
took place in the post World War II period and especially since 1964.&#13;
While employment in secondary activities rose appreciably a much more&#13;
dramatic increase took place in tertiary activities.&amp;/ A large part of the&#13;
increase in secondary activities was accounted for by the increase in con-&#13;
struction activity (3.7% in 1951, 4.5% in 1964 and 5.5% in 1973). Raising&#13;
the level of construction activity as a prime mover of development was the&#13;
explicit policy of the Pastrana Government (1970-74) but this seems to have&#13;
been happening anyway during the whole post 1950 period. The&#13;
key component of this policy was intervention in financial markets. A new&#13;
saving instrument was introduced which assured savers a real rate of return&#13;
on their savings accounts through indexation of these accounts. A large&#13;
portion of these new funds for construction apparently went to Bogota.-/ One&#13;
does not, however, detect a particular increase in gross product of Bogota as&#13;
a result. This policy was de-emphasized by the Lopez Michelson administra-&#13;
tion (1974-78) although the system of indexed savings instruments has con-&#13;
tinued, albeit at a lower real rate of return.&#13;

The experience of rapid income growth accompanied by rapid&#13;
urbanization that Colombia has had in the post World War II period has&#13;
had other significant effects which suggest that the rate of urbanization&#13;
might now be slowing down. Fertility rates of women have declined&#13;
dramatically in recent times. The following table shows the effect of&#13;
increasing urbanization in this decline:&#13;

areas, their effect on the total rate is now dramatic, Rising educational&#13;

levels, lower mortality rates- , higher incomes and increasing female&#13;
participation rates in the labor force have presumably combined to produce&#13;
this result. One interesting feature of female participation rates is&#13;
that while they have remained constant or declined in Bogota since 1951&#13;
they have increased considerably in other cities as shown below;&#13;

As other urban areas also catch up, overall fertility&#13;
rates can be expected to decline further, thus causing a slow&#13;
down in the rate of growth of population as a whole as well as of urban&#13;
population. The effect of these trends is well illustrated by comparing&#13;
earlier forecasts for the growth of population in Bogota with actual&#13;
current levels.  The Bogota Urban Development (Phase II) Study-/ projected&#13;
a growth rate of over 6.5 percent per year for the decade of the seventies,&#13;
thus obtaining an estimate of 3.7 million for 1975 and 5.1 million in 1980.&#13;
However, current estimates suggest that at the end of 1978 the population&#13;
of Bogota was no greater than 3.5 million people!-/&#13;
In summary, it may be noted that Colombia has gone through a phase&#13;
of extremely rapid urbanization over the past half century. Bogota itself&#13;
has grown more than ten fold during this period but is still not as dominant&#13;
as a primate capital city as in most other Latin American countries. The data&#13;
on fertility rates, trends in the participation of women in the labor force&#13;
and indications of a recent slow down in the rate of growth of Bogota and&#13;
other large cities suggest that the period of explosive exponential growth&#13;

is over and the next decade will see Bogota growing much more slowly into&#13;
a mature metropolis. Projections for the provision of urban public services,&#13;
for employmenti, etc. must all take account of this trend so that the formula-&#13;
tion of public policy is not caught unprepared by this transition. This is&#13;
not to claim that the problems of urbanization will be any less difficult&#13;
but merely to emphasize that they will be different and hence simple growth&#13;
projections should be eschewed.&#13;

III. THE DATA&#13;
The City Study has assembled a data bank of existing sources of&#13;
data in Bogota and Cali, Colombia in the form of copies of the original&#13;
computer tapes prepared by the respective originators of the data. All&#13;
have been documented in detail in Nelson Valverde (1978) and Y. J. Lee (1978).&#13;
This study utilizes 5 of these data sets; all originally collected by DANE.-/&#13;
Any other sources used in this paper are secondary sources.&#13;
3.1       1970 Economic Census&#13;
DANE conducted a census of all establishments in Colombia employ-&#13;
ing over 5 employees in manufacturing, services, and commerce. Data were&#13;
collected on the characteristics of employers, employees, capital, output,&#13;
value added, etc. In addition, a sample survey was also conducted intending&#13;
to cover 20% of small firms, but I have estimated that its actual coverage&#13;
was somewhere between 3 and 5 percent in manufacturing, 10 to 15 percent in&#13;
commerce and less than 5 percent in services. It has therefore not been&#13;
utilized in this study. Tabulations concerning firm size distributions and&#13;
employee characteristics have been compiled elsewhere (Mohan and Nandwani,&#13;
1978) from these sources and the census is used here only to estimate the&#13;
size of the large firm sector and to check its coverage against other sources.&#13;
3.2       1973 Population Census&#13;
The last census undertaken was in 1973 and the one immediately&#13;
preceding was in 1964. Unfortunately the 1964 census does not report incomes&#13;
nor does it have intra-city spatial detail. There has been wide skepticism&#13;
1/ DANE: Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica&#13;
(National Statistical Agency, Colombia).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
concerning the coverage of the 1973 census-/ but Potter and Ordofiez (1976)&#13;
concluded after a careful demographic analysis that the information they&#13;
analyzed from the advance sample appeared to be of good quality, at least in&#13;
relation to previous censuses. They estimated that the overall under-&#13;
enumeration for Colombia as a whole was probably about 7 percent. The public&#13;
use tape. provided by DANE is a 4% sample of households. However, for Bogota the&#13;
tape contains all households living in the buildings which happen to have the house-&#13;
holds in the 4% sample. Consequently, the tape contains about 47,000 house-&#13;
holds which actually amount to about an 8% sample. We have used the whole&#13;
sample for tabulations in this paper but the sample has been expanded to&#13;
reflect the size of the city accounting for estimated under-numeration.&#13;
Since this study is particularly concerned with the spatial distributions&#13;
within the city, the sample was expanded appropriately to be representative&#13;
of the city. Details of the methodology are given in Appendix (3).&#13;
The census contains information on dwelling characteristics, house-&#13;
hold characteristics, demographic information on all individuals, labor force&#13;
information for workers and fertility information on females. While I cannot&#13;
comment on its coverage the overall quality of the information in the sample&#13;
appears to be good and I am therefore in agreement with Potter and Ordonez&#13;
(1976). Non-responses appear to be distributed randomly; the only obvious&#13;
bias is that single member households predominate in the no information&#13;
categories in income and labor force information. One of. the distinguishing&#13;
features of this data set which makes it very useful for us is that the loca-&#13;
tion of respondents is coded down to the block (manzana) of residence in the&#13;
1/ One example of such skepticism is Lubell and McCallum (1978) (p. 126) who&#13;
regard the Bogota 1973 results as "simply not useable" and therefore place&#13;
no reliance on the census. For their calculations and projections they&#13;
prefer the 1972 Urban Development Study Household Survey covering 4675&#13;
households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

city. The following section will describe the consistent geo-coding system&#13;
used by DANE in all of its work. All distributions appearing in this paper&#13;
are from tabulations from the sample and not from DANE publications on the&#13;
census. Given the large size of the sample I regard the distributions from it&#13;
as more "'true" than from household surveys although the quality of income&#13;
information is likely to be poorer. The income was obtained from only one&#13;
question "what was your income from all sources last month?" Only about 12&#13;
percent of the sample did not report income information--a proportion which&#13;
compares well with non-responses in the U.S. census.&#13;
Appendix (2) reports the results of an estimation of the income&#13;
coverage of the 1973 census as well as the 1977 Household Survey (see below).&#13;
It appears that an aggregation of all incomes reported in the census amounts&#13;
to no more than 50 percent of the estimated total personal income for Bogota.&#13;
Various factors responsible for this under-reporting can be enumerated:&#13;
*   12% of the people gave no income information.&#13;
*   When only one question is asked, much of the non-labor&#13;
earnings are probably not reported.&#13;
*   Income in kind, e.g. as received by domestic servants, is&#13;
probably not reported.&#13;
*   Many earners receive end of the year bonuses:   these are&#13;
characteristically not covered in one shot cross-section&#13;
surveys such as the census unless the question is asked&#13;
specifically.&#13;
Keeping these factors in mind it is then not surprising that the income cover-&#13;
age of the census is only about 50%.-/&#13;
1/ This may be compared with a recent estimate of under-coverage in the&#13;
Brazil 1960 and 1970 censuses where Pfeffermann and Webb (1978) estimate&#13;
that the censuses cover about 57- 58 percent of the income. (p. 16).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
3.3       Household Surveys&#13;
DANE has conducted a regular program of household surveys from&#13;
1970 with the main objective of collecting information on the labor force.&#13;
Since 1975 these surveys have been quarterly and are conducted alternatingly&#13;
in the four largest cities and in the seven largest cities-/ along with an&#13;
occasional national survey. We have obtained the computer tapes for 1972&#13;
(Encuesta de Hogares - Fuerza de Trabajo: EH 6-FT), 1975 (EH8E), and 1977&#13;
(EH15). The 1972 survey was a national one and covered 6371 households of&#13;
whom 1348 were in Bogota. It contains information on housing as well as&#13;
demographic and labor force characteristics. This survey does not provide&#13;
the intra-city location of the respondents. The 1975 survey was a special&#13;
one for the city of Bogota and sampled 3953 households and contains infor-&#13;
mation on demographic and labor force characteristics only. The 1977 survey&#13;
was conducted in the four largest cities and sampled 6082 households of whom&#13;
3161 households, were in Bogota. Starting with this survey DANE has begun&#13;
to use "rotational sampling" such that 67% of dwelling units sampled remain&#13;
in the next survey and 33% are new. Both the 1975 and 1977 surveys contain&#13;
the location of residence of the respondents. The 1972 and 1975 surveys&#13;
also have firm size information on the number of employees working in each&#13;
respondents' work place. This question was not included in the 1977 sample.&#13;
The 1972 and 1975 surveys are used in this study only for the purpose of&#13;
deriving firm size distributions as between large and small firms.-/ The&#13;
bulk of this paper utilizes the 1977 sample since it was the most recent&#13;
one obtained and compares it with the 1973 census pointing to the obvious&#13;
1/ Bogota, Cali, Medellin, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Manizales and Pasto.&#13;
The first four are the four largest.&#13;
2/ All the distributions reported for the 1977 survey were duplicated for&#13;
the 1975 survey but are not reported here for ease of exposition. The&#13;
results were largely consistent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
discrepancies between the two sources as well as the areas of agreement.&#13;
In carrying out these samples DANE classifies neighborhoods into 6 socio-&#13;
economic strata: 1 low-low, 2 low, 3 medium low, 4 medium, 5 medium high&#13;
and 6 high. At the conclusion of a survey weights are assigned to each of&#13;
these strata which are then applied to the members of these strata for all&#13;
expansions of the sample. These "expansion factors" are supposed to ac-&#13;
count for over and under sampling that might occur over the course of the&#13;
survey. The expanded sample should then be correctly representative of the&#13;
city as a whole.&#13;
The 1977 survey is unusual in that as many as 20 percent of the&#13;
working respondents did not report their incomes: a proportion which com-&#13;
pares very unfavorably with the census. Because of this high proportion a&#13;
method was devised to impute incomes to the non-respondents. Appendix (1)&#13;
describes the calculation of incomes for all respondents and imputation&#13;
method for non-respondents.&#13;
The coverage of income in this survey is not much better than that&#13;
in the census despite the more detailed questions asked. Labor income and&#13;
non-labor income data are taken separately and income in kind is estimated&#13;
as well. As shown in Appendix (2), even when the imputed incomes are in-&#13;
cluded the survey covers only about 61 percent of estimated total personal&#13;
income of Bogota. It also appears that the highest incomes are either&#13;
under-reported or undersampled. If the incomes reported in the 1977 sample&#13;
are converted to 1973 pesos it is found that, on average, there is little&#13;
real growth in incomes, while those in the highest categories actually&#13;
decline. The last section showed, on the contrary, that there was real&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
income growth per capita in Bogota of about 1.5 to 2.0 percent per year&#13;
during this period. I have therefore not deflated 1977 incomes to 1973&#13;
levels which would have facilitated comparison because I do not believe&#13;
that such a comparison would be consistent across all income groups in&#13;
the sample. Hence all incomes are reported in current pesos. All incomes&#13;
are monthly incomes.&#13;
3.4       Household Survey Samples and the Spatial Disaggregation of Bogota&#13;
Map 2 (in Section 4,3) shows a representation of the map of Bogota. The&#13;
basic socio-economic spatial unit in Bogota is a "barrio" or neighborhood of which&#13;
there were about 500 in 1973 and about 700 now as a result of rapid growth&#13;
of the city. DANE geo-codes this unit in a 4 digit number of which the first&#13;
2 digits identify a comuna - a collection of barrios. The last 2 digits then&#13;
identify barrios within a comuna. The basic unit of analysis in this study&#13;
is a comuna of which there were 38 in 1973. These were then further aggregated&#13;
into "rings" and "sectors" as will be detailed in the next section. The&#13;
boundaries of the comunas shown in the map are principal streets in Bogota.&#13;
The city is bounded in the East by mountains and therefore has an approximately&#13;
semi-circular shape, although it is longer going North to South as is evident&#13;
from the map. As an aid to understanding the numbering system, note that the.&#13;
first digit goes from 1 to 9 and roughly rotates (increasing) from South to&#13;
North by sectors (or pie slices). The second digit ranges from 1 to 6 and&#13;
corresponds roughly to rings centered in comunas 31 and 81 and increasing&#13;
from South to North.&#13;
DANE along with the Ministry of Health compiled an inventory of&#13;
blocks ("manzanas") and of dwelling units within the city before the census&#13;
in 1973 and that inventory has continued to form the sample frame of all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
subsequent surveys in Bogota. Thus none of these surveys has sampled the&#13;
new neighborhoods that have developed in the past 5 years.- The sampling&#13;
is designed to make it equi-probable that any dwelling unit in the city&#13;
according to the 1972 inventory may be selected. The basic unit of sampling&#13;
(unidad primaria de muestra) is a block within which all households in all&#13;
dwelling units are interviewed. Provision is made for different sizes of&#13;
blocks. Since all the sampling is based on the 1972 sample frame it is&#13;
difficult to trace time trends in the changes within the city. Moreover, any&#13;
conclusions that are drawn about the changing character of neighborhoods must&#13;
be cautious. If different regions of the city differ from one another&#13;
systematically and if one region changes character over time the later&#13;
samples would no longer be representative. Sampling is based on the classi-&#13;
fication of neighborhoods into the 6 socio-economic strata. If neighborhoods&#13;
change character i.e., filter up or down in the socio-economic scale, the&#13;
resulting sample would then no longer be representative. Hence, drawing con-&#13;
clusions about fine changes in income distribution from two household surveys&#13;
at two points of time is a hazardous business without detailed knowledge of&#13;
the sampling procedures used. If, however, rates of change are not high,&#13;
such difficulties are minimal: but then one would have less interest in&#13;
tracing time trends anyway! These remarks may be extended to the coverage&#13;
of national surveys where the heterogeneity of regions is perhaps typically&#13;
more pronounced than within a city.&#13;
These details have been offered here since they are seldom given&#13;
by users of household survey data. In many cases where broad behavioral&#13;
relationships are being investigated they are not as important and therefore&#13;

conducted in December 1978 is based on a partially updated sample frame.&#13;

their omission is justified. Here, however, since the interest is to&#13;
compile a statistical and spatial profile of Bogota they need greater&#13;
attention. Ultimately, only censuses can be relied on for reliable com-&#13;
parisons over time but they have their own problems in terms of quality of&#13;
data as opposed to coverage.&#13;

IV. POPULATION, DENSITY AND INCOME IN BOGOTA&#13;
4.1       Introduction-&#13;
Bogota was founded as far back as 1538 and has been the seat&#13;
of government since 1717, originally for the Viceroyalty of Nueva Granada&#13;
(which included modern Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador) and later&#13;
for Colombia. Its growth, however has taken place mainly over the last&#13;
hundred years during which it has expanded more than eighty fold in&#13;
population. In comparison, for example, Bombay in India has only grown&#13;
about ten fold over the same period. The modern city, therefore, has to&#13;
be understood in the context of this extremely rapid change that has&#13;
taken place in living memory. Table 4.1 illustrates the nature of this&#13;
change in contrast to the somewhat somnolent growth of the city in the&#13;
previous period of three hundred years.&#13;
If the data in this table are to be relied on, they show&#13;
dramatically how the city has grown in recent years. The highest rate of&#13;
change was recorded in the nineteen fifties which was at least partly be-&#13;
cause of the violencia. The area data are probably more dubious because&#13;
the definition of the area of a city is always somewhat arbitrary. The&#13;
extension of a city's boundaries do, however, reflect the area that is&#13;
regarded as belonging to the city at any given time. The average population&#13;
density of the city then shows a remarkably stable pattern in the face of&#13;
such rapid population growth. Peak density occurred at the end of the&#13;
nineteen fifties - the period of most rapid growth. Such a pattern tends&#13;
to show that the juridical area of the city has tended to follow the&#13;

population growth albeit with a lag. Constant average density implies that&#13;
the city has always been decentralizing as it has grown in the sense that&#13;
the central parts of the city have housed a successively smaller proportion&#13;
of the city. It would be interesting to examine if such a pattern holds&#13;
for other cities. If it does it would go against the general idea that&#13;
cities have become increasing congested along with population growth&#13;
(except in the case of traffic congestion).&#13;
The 1978 figure for population is an estimate from the dwelling&#13;
unit counts done to update the sample frame for the City Study Survey.&#13;
The Phase II Bogota Urban Development Study forecast a rate of growth of&#13;
6.5 percent per year for the period 1975-80 and declining to 5.0 percent by&#13;
1990. This was a clear misreading of trends since the 1964-73 rate had&#13;
already declined to 5.8 percent. Their forecast for 1980 was a population&#13;
of 5.1 million while 'actual population is now not likely to be greater than 3.8&#13;
million. It would be ironic if the city now has difficulty in settling down to&#13;
a decreased rate of growth because the explosive experience of the past fifty&#13;
years has shaped the expectations of continuing rapid growth indefinitely.&#13;
Bogota is a relatively densely populated city. Table 4.1&#13;
showed the growth of Bogota since the seventeenth century and that its&#13;
population density has been quite stable over the past hundred years. It&#13;
is instructive to compare this density with other cities in the world.&#13;
Table 4.2 shows that Bogota falls somewhere between the densest cities&#13;
found in India and others much less so in the United States. Such com-&#13;
parisons are always difficult because of the different definitions of&#13;
city that are used by different sources of data. The population of Bogota&#13;
is difficult to divide between "central city" and "metropolitan area" as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

U.S. cities have been by the U,S. Census Bureau. The data reported in the&#13;
table are for U.S. central cities: it is striking that, except for New York,&#13;
even central cities in the U.S. are more sparsely settled than Bogota as a&#13;
whole. The "city proper" of Mexico City houses as many people as the&#13;
whole of Bogota but is twice as dense (Mexico City as a whole is, however,&#13;
about three times as large in population and six times as large in area).&#13;
Although the data reported for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are also for&#13;
"city proper" (as used by Ingram and Carroll (1979)) they appear to&#13;
represent an area somewhat between 'central city" and "metropolitan area"&#13;
and have a density less than half that of Bogota. The largest two Indian&#13;
cities are rather more dense and larger than Bogota but New Delhi appears&#13;
to be very similar. In summary, it is probably the case that Bogota would&#13;
appear more compact than comparable cities in Latin America if comparable&#13;
definitions were used, while other central cities might well be more densely&#13;
populated than Bogota,&#13;
As the data on area indicate, Bogota has grown almost as much&#13;
spatially as it has in population. Its original design was the traditional&#13;
rectangular grid of streets and avenues with the Plaza Principal as the&#13;
focus of the city. The built up area of the city until the early part of&#13;
this century was what is now only the centre or Central Business District&#13;
(C.B.D.). The city was primarily a commercial, political, religious center,&#13;
Medellin being the industrial capital-/ of the country. Chapinero, to the&#13;
north of the city was then an outlying suburb or village which slowly&#13;
joined up with the city during the second quarter of this century.-/&#13;
1/ Medellin had more manufacturing employment than Bogota until about&#13;
ten years ago.&#13;

The high and middle income residents began to move North-/ while the&#13;
Southern and Western parts of the city began to be filled up with lower and&#13;
lower-middle income residents. Chapinero itself began to replace the center&#13;
of the city as the primary commercial area during the nineteen fifties. The&#13;
city became elongated North to South, being bounded on the East with high&#13;
mountains and in the West by valuable agricultural land as well as low lying&#13;
lands which discouraged development. It is only over the last fifteen -&#13;
twenty years that the West has also begun to be filled up so that the city&#13;
now looks almost semi-circular.&#13;
As in other cities it is difficult to separate the effects on the&#13;
spatial development of a city of institutional decisions from those arising&#13;
from the exercise of individual preferences as revealed by the market. Since&#13;
much is made in this paper of the particular spatial income pattern found in the&#13;
city, it is of interest to note some of the main planning exercises that have&#13;
been carried out in Bogota, The two main influences on the shape of the&#13;
city were, perhaps, Brunner who organized a city planning department in 1935&#13;
and le Corbusier in 1951. Much of the existing zoning and planning regula-&#13;
tions can be attributed to Brunner. The northern part of the city was zoned&#13;
for low density residential development while the south was zoned for high&#13;
2/&#13;
density development-. Le Corbusierls main contribution was the creation of&#13;
an industrial zone to the west of the city which effectively separated the&#13;
poor south from the rich north - by intent or fortuitously.-/&#13;
1/ See Peter Amato (1968) for a detailed description of this phenomena.&#13;
2/ As described in Peter Amato (1968). I am not arguing that zoning&#13;
regulations caused this pattern: merely that the zoning is&#13;
largely consistent with the observed land use pattern.&#13;

As the following sections of this paper will show, this pattern&#13;
of somewhat segregated land uses in the city has got solidified and the&#13;
rich are continuing to move northwards while the poor, though present to&#13;
some extent all over the city are more concentrated in the extreme south.&#13;
4.2       Economic and Demographic Structure of the City&#13;
This section gives the economic and demographic structure of the&#13;
city as it has developed since 1951. In common with many Latin American&#13;
cities Bogota has more females than males because of the immigration of a&#13;
large number of young women for domestic service:&#13;
1951        1964         1973        19771/&#13;
Percent Male             45.2        46.6        46.6        47.5&#13;
Percent Female           54.8        53.4        53.4        52.5&#13;
If the 1977 household survey is an accurate representation of the city, it&#13;
would indicate that the sex ratio is tending to be more equal.&#13;
As a result of rapid population growth we can observe the&#13;
preponderance of children in the age structure of the city-&#13;
Age Group       1951               1964              1973&#13;

The age structure changed remarkably between 1951 and 1964 but has remained&#13;
roughly constant since then. There might be a tendency lately for the pro-&#13;
portion of children to decline again, along with the decline in fertility.&#13;
Such an age structure implies a continuing fast growth of the&#13;
labor force after the growth rate of population declines. In addition the&#13;
large proportion of children implies a lower overall participation rate in&#13;
1/&#13;
the labor force and a higher number of dependents per worker.-&#13;
Table 4.3 gives the sex specific participation rates for different&#13;
years in Bogota. We can observe that the male participation rate has been&#13;
declining continuously since 1951. This is largely accounted for by the&#13;
15-29 age group a large proportion of whom are now continuing in school and&#13;
college. The difference in the female participation rate between Bogota and&#13;
other cities was remarked on earlier (in Section II). The evolution of the&#13;
rate in Bogota is itself interesting in that the 15 - 59 age group rate has&#13;
increased somewhat during this period. A closer examination of age specific&#13;
rates reveals that the participation rate of the youngest age group, those&#13;
between 15 and 20 years, declined from about 50 percent to about 33 percent&#13;
but increased for almost all other age groups, except the oldest.&#13;
Table 4.4 reports the trend of unemployment rates in Bogota,&#13;
Medellin and Cali since 1964. It shows that the labor market has tightened up&#13;
in Bogota considerably since the early seventies and that unemployment rates&#13;
are now probably below those observed in North American cities in recent years.&#13;
It is, however, interesting that both Medellin and Cali have not fared as&#13;
well and their rates of unemployment appear to have increased during this&#13;
period. Note also that women have had higher rates of unemployment in these&#13;

years. This might indicate an increasing desire of women to participate:&#13;
The participation rates of women would perhaps be even higher if the unemploy-&#13;
ment rates were not so high.-/&#13;
Table 4.5 compares the structure of employment in Bogota with that&#13;
in various other cities in the world. It also shows how the structure has&#13;
remained fairly stable since 1951 except for a slow trend for manufacturing&#13;
to increase its share of employment. There are a number of interesting&#13;
features in the table. Non-capital cities - Calcutta, Bombay, Sao Paulo -&#13;
have a smaller proportion of employment in services, presumably the govern-&#13;
ment sector. They also have a much higher proportion of people in&#13;
manufacturing. All cities have over 20 percent in manufacturing except for&#13;
Jakarta which has correspondingly higher proportion in commerce. All cities&#13;
have over 5 percent of their employment in construction except for the two&#13;
Indian cities. Overall, we can conclude that compared with other cities&#13;
Bogota has what might be called a rather balanced structure of employment&#13;
which is quite similar to other capital cities. It is not the case that&#13;
service employment is over-represented as it is in the two African cities.&#13;
Bogota has therefore evolved from a largely administrative, religious, com-&#13;
mercial city into a well balanced metropolitan city.&#13;
Table 4.6 reports the structure of production for Bogota, Jakarta&#13;
and Calcutta. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain the structure of&#13;
production for most cities - since such data are characteristically avail-&#13;
able at the national or at best at state level. It is therefore not possible&#13;
to compare it with other cities. Jakarta and Calcutta are peculiar in&#13;
different ways: Jakarta has a very small manufacturing sector while Calcutta&#13;

has a very big one in terms of its share in total production.   Bogota appears&#13;
somewhere between the two. Once again we can note that the economic structure&#13;
has not changed appreciably over the past 15 years for which data are avail-&#13;
able. There is some indication that the share of manufacturing may have&#13;
decreased slightly but the data are, perhaps, not reliable enough to warrant&#13;
such a conclusion. If, however, it is true that manufacturing has decreased&#13;
its share in production while its employment share has increased, it would&#13;
indicate that the substitution of capital for labor has, perhaps not been as&#13;
rapid as is sometimes suspected. In any case, it is clear that Bogota is&#13;
a well balanced city in the sense that it is neither dominated by administra-&#13;
tive pursuits nor manufacturing.&#13;
4.3       The Spatial Distribution of Population and Density&#13;
As mentioned in Section 3.4, the primary spatial unit of analysis&#13;
used in this paper is the "comuna." The division of the city into these&#13;
comunas is shown in Map 2 along with their population. As is obvious from&#13;
the map, the size as well as population of these comunas varies significantly.&#13;
The smallest comuna has 174 hectares while the largest is more than twenty&#13;
times as large with 3680 hectares. The population varies less, from about&#13;
25 thousand to about 230 thousand. Appendix Table A4.1 gives the spatial&#13;
distribution of population by comuna for both 1973 and 1977. The estimated&#13;
population is naturally greater for most comunas in 1973 but is more than 1.5&#13;
times as high for as many as 9 comunas. It is difficult to determine whether&#13;
this represents an actual increase in population in these areas or an over-&#13;
sample of these areas. Since the sample frame of the survey was based on a&#13;
1972 count one is tempted to conclude that these estimates do represent over&#13;
sampling rather than increases in actual population. These comunas do not&#13;
appear to have any particular characteristics in common and may not, there-&#13;
fore, result in a particular bias in sample results. These results are&#13;

pointed out here to indicate the difficulties of working with a sample survey&#13;
of a city and drawing conclusions about spatial distributions. Indeed, the&#13;
spatial sub-samples have to be used with caution since they might well be too&#13;
small to represent accurately the sub-areas of the city. Thus the 1973 dis-&#13;
tributions are regarded as more representative since they are from the census.&#13;
Appendix Table A4.2 reports the area and population density for each&#13;
comuna. The spread of densities in Bogota is better appreciated from the computer&#13;
maps 3a and 3b. As might be expected the outskirts are relatively sparsely&#13;
populated while the center is more dense. Three other features stand out,&#13;
however. First, the south of the city is clearly more densely populated than&#13;
than the north; second, the center (central business district, comuna 31) is&#13;
less dense than some of its surrounding areas; and third, the densest comuna&#13;
is more than 10 times as dense as the least dense but some of the outlying&#13;
comunas are about as dense as some of the inner areas. This last feature is&#13;
of considerable interest. Population density functions are often used to&#13;
describe the structure of cities! in a convenient summary fashion. The&#13;
general hypothesis is that population density of cities declines exponentially&#13;
from the center toward the outskirts of the city.2A This detailed examination&#13;
of the pattern for Bogota shows how such an estimation can be somewhat mislead-&#13;
ing though still instructive at a more general level. The high density area&#13;
is spread around both sides of the c.b.d. and roughly bounded by the Avenida&#13;
1/  See Mills and Tan (1978) for a review of work estimating density functions.&#13;
2/ For the City Study, Ingram and Carroll (1979) estimate such functions for a&#13;
number of South American cities and A. Pachon (1979) estimates&#13;
Di = Do exp(-bdi ) for Bogota&#13;
where&#13;
Di is density in comuna i,&#13;
Do is density at the center&#13;
di is the distance from the center, and&#13;
d  and b (the gradient) are estimated.&#13;
0&#13;
Pachon's results are&#13;
Do = 342 persons/ha. and b = .17.&#13;

Ciudad de Quito (as also observed by Pachon, 1979), As shown in Maps 3 a&#13;
rather large portion of the city has uniformly high density. The southern&#13;
outskirts have densities higher than the mean.&#13;
This result is consistent with the finding that the overall density&#13;
of Bogota is high compared with central city densities in other cities as was&#13;
discussed in Section 4.1. A better description of population densities in&#13;
Bogota would necessitate a more disaggregated approach. Density gradients&#13;
calculated for different directions of the city would be of interest. A more&#13;
descriptive approach is used here instead and the city is divided into rings&#13;
and radial sectors in order to observe density patterns.&#13;
Map 4 shows the division of Bogota into the rings and sectors which&#13;
are used consistently in the City Study. Table 4.7 reports the growth of&#13;
population and density from 1964 to 1977.-/ Population and density declined&#13;
in absolute terms in the centre of the city during the whole period. The ,&#13;
highest density was in the c.b.d. (ring 1) in 1964 but ring 2 (about 1 to 3&#13;
kilometers from the center) became the densest in 1973 even though it also&#13;
lost population between the two census years. It is striking that ring 3&#13;
(between 3 to 6 kilometers) and ring 4 have very similar densities in 1973 as&#13;
a result of ring 4 having grown faster. The fastest growth clearly occurred in&#13;
rings 5 and 6. Indeed, ring 5 accommodated twice as much of the incremental&#13;
population during those years as the rest of the city put together.-/ Ring 6&#13;
was almost uninhabited in 1964. Thus Table 4.7 shows clearly that the major&#13;
part of the population growth in Bogota in recent years has been in the out-&#13;
lying rings. There has been some decentralization of population i.e. the&#13;

absolute decline of population in the two inner rings but this has been minor&#13;
compared with the incremental additions in the outskirts.&#13;
Table 4.8 gives the same information for radial sectors. Sector 1&#13;
is identical to ring 1 and is the central business district. The southern&#13;
sectors (2, 3, 4) are almost twice as densely populated as the northern&#13;
sectors (6, 7, 8). They have grown somewhat uniformly except that sector 6&#13;
has grown faster than the others. This corroborates the earlier statement&#13;
that it is only recently that the west of the city has begun to be filled up&#13;
and that the city had largely been a North-South strip stretching along the&#13;
mountains until the early sixties. Sectors 4 and 5 form the industrial&#13;
corridor that Le Corbusier initiated in 1951. Note that, on average, the&#13;
densities of rings 3 and 4 are very similar to sectors 3 and 4. This implies&#13;
that the northern part of sector 8 is even more sparse than the average.&#13;
4.4       The Spatial Distribution of Income&#13;
The distribution of income was first examined at the comuna level.&#13;
Appendix table A.4.5 reports the mean household income per month in current&#13;
pesos for each comuna for both 1973 and 1977, the mean household income per&#13;
capita (HINCAP)-1/and the comunas are ranked according to HINCAP for each&#13;
year. The rankings for the two years are not identical but very similar.&#13;
If taken in groups of ten, seven in the first ten in 1973 are among the first&#13;
ten in 1977 also, seven are common in the second ten, eight in the third and&#13;
seven in the last eight. The Pearson rank correlation coefficient was&#13;
estimated to be 0.93 so it may be concluded that the rankings do not differ&#13;
significantly between the two years.&#13;
1/ See Sudhir Anand (1979) for justification of the use of this income&#13;
concept as the appropriate per capita welfare indicator. Household&#13;
income per Adult Equivalent is difficult to use because there is no&#13;
general agreement on the appropriate age weights that should be used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
Note from this table that the poorest comuna had a HINCAP of only&#13;
about a twelfth as much as the richest in 1973. Note also that the incomes&#13;
of the poorest comunas appeared to increase about as much as inflation&#13;
between those two years (about 250 percent) but not as much for the richest&#13;
comunas. One may therefore conclude that the incomes in the rich areas were&#13;
significantly under-reported in 1977. Distributions within each comuna were&#13;
also generated for 1973 in order to obtain an idea of the heterogeneity&#13;
within the comunas.-/ They were found to be relatively homogeneous - a fact&#13;
which in itself is not surprising since any city typically has its low and high&#13;
income areas. Appendix Table A4.5 also reports the proportion of households in&#13;
each comuna who fall in the bottom 30 percent of households in Bogota. Among the&#13;
top ten only two have proportions significantly above 30 percent. These&#13;
comunas are clearly more heterogeneous than others: significantly one is in&#13;
the center of the city and the other in the extreme North - both being zones&#13;
of transition. In the second ten there is only one with a proportion&#13;
significantly over 40 percent (comuna 85) which is also in the extreme North&#13;
and also undergoing transition and becoming much richer as can be seen in&#13;
the map. It is also of interest to note that the proportion of poor increase&#13;
much more regularly from the rich to the poor comunas in the 1977 sample: this&#13;
implies that people sampled in a household survey are representative of the&#13;
mean for their area. The extremes of an area get left out perhaps.&#13;
A glance at the computer maps 5a and 5b which illustrate HINCAP by&#13;
comuna for the two years shows that mean income varies across the city in a&#13;
remarkably regular fashion, increasing in income as one proceeds clockwise&#13;
1/ A more systematic analysis of the spatial distribution of income in&#13;
Bogota will form the subject of another paper in this series.&#13;

from the South to the North. There is little discernible pattern as one&#13;
moves from the center to the outskirts.&#13;
Table 4.9 reports the household and income distributions by rings in&#13;
the city. A mild pattern is discernible. There is a tendency for income to&#13;
rise somewhat as one proceeds from the center toward the periphery and then to&#13;
decline. The differences, however, are small and the coefficients of varia-&#13;
tion large. It is, however, true that ring 5 is poorer than the rest. For&#13;
most of the rings, the proportion of households in the ring is not very&#13;
different from the share of income - except for ring 5 which receives much&#13;
less than its share. Thus it is clear that the income distribution pattern&#13;
is quite different from U.S. cities where income, in general, increases as&#13;
one moves from the center to the periphery. The data partially supports the&#13;
idea that the poor in cities in developing countries get pushed out to the&#13;
periphery. Note, however, that in 1977 ring 6 has the highest household in-&#13;
come indicating that Bogota also exhibits a partial tendency for the rich to&#13;
be moving outwards.!/&#13;
Table 4.10 reports similar distributions by radial sectors. The&#13;
pattern is clearly more pronounced when viewed in this way. The richest&#13;
sector (sector 8) has a mean HINCAP of more than 5 times the poorest (sector&#13;
2). Except for sector 6 which is relatively poor,income increases as one&#13;
moves from sector 2 to sector 8. The most heterogeneous zone is the c.b.d.&#13;
2/&#13;
with a very high coefficient of variation.- The difference between the poor&#13;
and rich does not appear as pronounced in 1977 because of the presumed&#13;
1/ Ring 6 is entirely in the North which is the direction in which the rich&#13;
are moving.&#13;
2/ Note also from both Table 4.9 and 4.10 that the within ring (sector)&#13;
variation is significantly less in the 1977 sample - as has been&#13;
remarked earlier.&#13;

under-reporting of income in the rich sectors. The share of income received&#13;
by the poor sectors is much less than their share of households. The ranking&#13;
of the sectors does not change between the two years. It is therefore clear&#13;
that a spatial analysis of Bogota is of more interest when done by radial&#13;
sectors rather than by rings, though the rings also exhibit some interesting&#13;
characteristics.&#13;
Before concluding this section one ring characteristic is important&#13;
to mention. Household size increases as one proceeds from the center to the&#13;
periphery as illustrated in map 6.-/   The majority of the dark shaded comunas&#13;
are in the periphery:&#13;

Larger households require greater space and hence are more likely to locate&#13;
away from the center.&#13;
Figure 4.1 illustrates the variation of income by household size.&#13;
It is clear that while larger households earn higher total incomes the com-&#13;
pensation is not large enough to offset the increase in household size.&#13;
Thus household income per capita declines with increasing size of household.&#13;
Larger households tend to be poorer. The periphery of Bogota therefore&#13;
probably contains larger as well as somewhat poorer households.&#13;
1/ Household size by comuna is reported for both 1973 and 1977 in&#13;
Appendix Table A-1.&#13;
2/ Single member households (characteristically difficult to find) appear&#13;
to have been under-sampled in 1977: they comprised only 5 percent of&#13;
all households as compared to 10 percent in 1973.&#13;

4.5       Summary&#13;
Bogota has had a remarkably long period of unbroken population&#13;
growth over the last hundred years: indeed, it has grown eighty-fold&#13;
during this period. The sustained growth rate of almost 5 percent per year&#13;
over the last 40 years has been truly astounding. Despite this growth the&#13;
average population density of the city has remained surprisingly constant.&#13;
Compared to other cities in the world Bogota is relatively densely&#13;
inhabited though less so than some Asian cities.&#13;
The demographic structure of the city is much like that of&#13;
other Latin American cities: it has a higher proportion of women as well&#13;
as children under 15 years of age, the latter comprising more than 40 per-&#13;
cent of the population. As a result of somewhat increasing rates of&#13;
participation of women in the labor force and of the predominance of young&#13;
people into the age structure, the labor force of Bogota can be expected to&#13;
continue to expand at high rates even after the population growth slows&#13;
down. In recent years, despite the expansion in the labor force, the&#13;
unemployment rate has been declining to what might be called internationally&#13;
acceptable rates. The city has a balanced economic structure which is not&#13;
dominated by manufacturing nor services nor adminstration as it is in some&#13;
other large cities in the world.&#13;
As the city has grown and its area has expanded, the largest&#13;
growth in population has occurred in the outer rings. The inner rings,&#13;
however, have had a relatively stable population unlike North American&#13;
central cities which have tended to lose population as they have decen-&#13;
tralized. The result in Bogota is that it now has high density all over&#13;
except in the outermost rings. The south of the city is much more densely&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

inhabited than the north. A detailed examination of income patterns reveals&#13;
no strong pattern by rings though there is a mild tendency for income to&#13;
first increase as one moves out of the center and then decrease again.&#13;
Household size does, however, increase monotonically with distance from the&#13;
city center. Average\household income is seen to increase as one moves&#13;
clockwise from the south of the city to the north except that one sector in&#13;
the north west of the city is poor too. The population density in rich areas&#13;
is clearly lower than in the poor areas.&#13;

V. SOME SELECTED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LABOR FORCE&#13;
Before proceeding to an analysis of the labor force according&#13;
to location of residence, this section provides some evidence on three&#13;
characteristics of workers that are often used in the categorization of&#13;
the informal sector. The size of firm -/is the most important classifi-&#13;
catory variable that is used and the following section illustrates the&#13;
difficulty in obtaining reliable data for such a classification. I then&#13;
examine the distribution of workers according to their division between&#13;
primary and secondary workers and according to hours worked. The members&#13;
of the informal sector are often said to be characterized by uncertainty&#13;
of hours worked. The data examined here has information on only a reference&#13;
week so there is no information on their uncertainty. But the uncertainty&#13;
should be reflected in the proportion of workers who work for only a few&#13;
hours.&#13;
5.1       Distribution of Workers between Small and Large Establishments&#13;
As pointed out by Mazumdar (1976) the formal sector often gets&#13;
identified with the "enumerated" sector. The size of the informal sector is&#13;
then deduced as the residual after deducting employment in the enumerated&#13;
sector from totals obtained from a population census. The purpose of this&#13;
section is to demonstrate how hazardous this exercise is by comparing&#13;
results from different sources for the city of Bogota: a city where the&#13;
volume and quality of data is among the best in developing countries.&#13;
1/ Such a classification has been used, among others, by Dipak Mazumdar (1977),&#13;
Sethuraman (1974), Webb (1976) and F. Bourguignon (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
Table 5.1 gives the distribution of employment for 1970, 1972,&#13;
and 1975. The numbers for 1970 are derived using the residual method while&#13;
those for 1972 and 1975 utilize the responses to a question on size of work&#13;
place that was included in those household surveys. For 1970 the distribution&#13;
of all workers by industry code is taken from the national household survey&#13;
of that year as are the total number of workers. The proportion of workers&#13;
in large firms (firms employing more than 5 employees) is the number of&#13;
workers enumerated in the 1970 economic census in each industry as a&#13;
fraction of the implied total number from the household survey. The&#13;
distribution of all workers among industries seems reliable since the&#13;
proportions are remarkably constant over the different surveys. By this&#13;
method as many as 50 percent of all workers in manufacturing worked in&#13;
small firms. The food and fabricated metals industries appear to be&#13;
dominated by large firms while all the others have about 50 percent or less&#13;
workers in large firms. However, in 1972, the proportion in large firms in&#13;
manufacturing is about 60 percent and that in 1975 is about 70 percent.&#13;
The latter figure should be more reliable because it is from a much larger&#13;
sample. There is even less comparability between the proportions reported&#13;
for the three years at the 2 digit level. It is not unreasonable to assume&#13;
that the 1970 figures for large firms are on the low side because the&#13;
economic census was not likely to have had 100 percent coverage of large&#13;
firms. Hence at least 50 percent of manufacturing employment must be in&#13;
large firms. It is difficult to go any further since the 1972 and 1975&#13;
estimates are so far apart. If these surveys suffered from similar sampling&#13;

S&amp;.rce:  1970  1970 Economic Census, 1970 Household Survey (EH2)  Total number of workers in 1970 is from the Household Survey Distribution. Total number of workers in large firms is&#13;
from the 1970 Economic Census of Inidustry, Co;marce and Services covering all firms employing more than 5 employees. The Number of workers in small firms is then&#13;
calculated as a residual.&#13;
1972. 1975: 1972 Household Survey (EH6FT), 1975 Household Survey (EI8E). For 1972 and 1975 the distributions are directly from the survey smoples.&#13;
'/  'Small" is defined as firms employing fever than 5 employees.  "Large" covers firms employing more than 5 employees.&#13;
2/ For 1572 and 1975, social services includes government employees who fall in the "large" category.  They were not covered by the 1970 economic census; hence, 0.0 percent in&#13;
large establishments in 1970.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
problems as those conjectured for 1977 it would then not be surprising&#13;
that employees of large firms are over-represented. A spatial analysis&#13;
of the 1975 data similar to that performed for 1977 will help in making&#13;
progress on this issue. A further point to note is that even if employment&#13;
in small manufacturing is, at the most, 50 percent of all'manufacturing it&#13;
constitutes only 10 percent of the total labor force. However, it is more&#13;
likely to be around 8 percent.-/ Hence, efforts at increasing employment in&#13;
small scale industry, can, at best, expect to make a difference of 1 or 2&#13;
percentage points in total employment (an increase of 12 to 25 percent in&#13;
small industry). In areas with open unemployment rates between 6 to 9&#13;
percent such a strategy would only make a marginal difference.&#13;
The situation in commerce seems remarkably consistent. About&#13;
60 to 70 percent of all employment is in small firms in all three years.&#13;
As may be expected a large proportion of wholesale trade is in large firms;&#13;
but it is surprising that as much as half of all restaurant and hotel&#13;
employment is in small establishments. The pattern in services is quite&#13;
consistent between 1972 and 1975 (except for personal services). The&#13;
coverage of the economic census appears to have been quite poor in services.&#13;
Only 30 percent of employment in services is reported in large establishments&#13;
in 1975 while about 45 percent is reported for 1972. Employment not covered&#13;
1/ In examining Social Security data Kyu Sik Lee found that in 1977 about&#13;
210,000 manufacturing workers worked in firms of more than 5 employees&#13;
and were covered by social security. The 1977 survey reveals that total&#13;
manufacturing employment was about 290,000. Thus, even if we assume&#13;
that all firms employing over 5 employees (an unreasonable assumption)&#13;
were represented in the social security records, a maximum 30 percent&#13;
of manufacturing workers would be in small firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
in any of the above categories amounts to about 20 percent. Finally,&#13;
for both 1972 and 1975, employment in small firms falls between 45 to 50&#13;
percent of all employment -- although it has been demonstrated above that&#13;
major discrepancies exist among the sub-categories.&#13;
Thus it may be concluded that it is quite hazardous to deduce&#13;
the size of the informal or formal sector from normal statistical sources.&#13;
Policies based on such calculations can consequently be quite misdirected.&#13;
Even if orders of magnitude can be obtained by comparing sources as done&#13;
above, there is virtually no possibility of deducing time trends.&#13;
5.2       Distribution of Primary and Secondary Workers&#13;
The informal sector is said to employ a disproportionately&#13;
large proportion of secondary earners and women. I investigate their&#13;
distribution according to income rather than the formal/informal dichotomy.&#13;
Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of heads of households (or primary&#13;
earners) by decile, for both males and females. The patterns for males&#13;
and females are quite distinct. Of all male workers, about 70 percent are&#13;
primary earners while they constitute only about 14 percent of women&#13;
workers. For male workers, the secondary earners are predominantly in&#13;
the bottom half of the worker income distribution. As many as 50 percent&#13;
of males in the bottom decile are secondary earners while only 12 percent&#13;
of the top decile are secondary earners. 65 percent of all heads of house-&#13;
hold are in the top half among males. There is almost a linear progression&#13;
from the bottom to the top decile as graphed in Figure 2. For females&#13;

the pattern is somewhat more complicated. Firstly, about 62 percent of all&#13;
women workers fall in the bottom half of the distribution. Secondly, the&#13;
proportions of primary earners first declines and then rises by decile.&#13;
Primary workers are least represented in the middle deciles. Such a pattern&#13;
implies that many women workers must have a rather flat age-earnings profile.&#13;
Many of the heads of households in the lower deciles must be unskilled,&#13;
uneducated females entering the labor force at a late age, possibly as&#13;
widows, i.e. where their participation in the labor force is compelled by&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
In summary, it is found that about 70 percent of all workers&#13;
falling in the bottom 30 percent of the worker income distribution are male&#13;
secondary earners or women. This finding matches such a characterization&#13;
of the "informal sector" if that is merely a title given to the poorer&#13;
section of the labor force.&#13;
5.3       Distribution of Workers According to Hours Worked&#13;
Unemployment and participation rates will be discussed in a&#13;
later paper in this series. Here I present the distribution of workers&#13;
according to the hours worked weekly. Are workers who work less than 35-40&#13;
hours a week underemployed? Table 5.2 gives the mean incomes of workers&#13;
according to hours worked weekly. Firstly, about 70 percent of all workers&#13;
work what might be termed "regular hours" -- 40 to 60 hours a week. About&#13;
20 percent work excessive hours -- more than 60 h\ours a week and only about&#13;
10 percent work less than 40 hours. A more detailed examination of the data&#13;

reveals that among males those working less than 30 hours are proportionately&#13;
divided between the top 70 (3.5%), and bottom 30 percent (3%). Almost 25&#13;
percent of all males who work less than 30 hours a week are classified as&#13;
professional or technical workers. Construction and production workers&#13;
predominate among the other occupational categories. Thus the "under-&#13;
employed", i.e. those who work less than 30 hours a week are composed of&#13;
two distinct groups: the rich professionals and technical workers who are&#13;
probably voluntarily underemployed and the poor construction and production&#13;
workers who are indeed underemployed. This observation is borne out by&#13;
examining the evidence on which categories of workers say that they would&#13;
like more work. Almost 50 percent of all male workers who would like more&#13;
work are production or construction workers. However, only a quarter of&#13;
these work less than 30 hours. Consequently the underemployed have different&#13;
characteristics depending on the definition used. If a definition of few&#13;
hours worked is used, then the underemployed are not necessarily poor nor&#13;
involuntary. If the definition includes all those who say that they would&#13;
like more work, the majority of those (about 70-75%) are already working&#13;
greater than 40 hours. They may not, in fact be able to work more, even if&#13;
they say so for reasons of poverty. Lastly, it may be noted that the 10&#13;
percent of workers who work excessive hours earn less than the overall mean.&#13;
The predominant categories among these are sales managers, service workers&#13;
and transportation workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
Among women, the position is similar in that about a quarter&#13;
of all women working fewer than 30 hours are professional or technical&#13;
workers and production workers are over-represented as well. Those working&#13;
excessive hours are maids and sales managers. It may once again be noted&#13;
that the mean incomes of the overworked are less than those working a&#13;
"normal" work week.&#13;
On the whole it may be concluded that not more than three or four&#13;
percent of the workers are underemployed in the sense that they work fewer&#13;
than 30 hours a week and would like more work. If the low incomes of those&#13;
working excessive hours reflect their productivity, they might paradoxically&#13;
be underemployed too. Those working few hours and looking for extra work&#13;
are predominantly construction or production workers and not workers in the&#13;
service sector as may have been expected. Those in the service sector are&#13;
over-represented in the *over-worked low income category.&#13;

VI. THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF WORKERS-/ IN BOGOTA&#13;
6.1       The Distribution of Workers by Residence and Workplace&#13;
This section draws a mapping of workers in Bogota according to&#13;
their location of residence. It shows that the characteristics of workers&#13;
in each sector differ systematically from those in other sectors when&#13;
viewed in any dimension. Table 6.1 gives the overall distribution of&#13;
workers between the sectors for 1977. The pattern follows that for house-&#13;
holds and the income ranking of the sectors remains unchanged, as might be&#13;
expected, when done with worker earnings rather than household incomes.&#13;
The unexpectedly large proportion of female workers in sectors 7 and 8&#13;
(the rich northern sectors) but with low mean incomes is accounted for&#13;
by the presence of a large number of female domestic servants serving rich&#13;
households in those sectors. It is also of interest to note that the mean&#13;
earnings of women are only about half that of men in Bogota. The particularly&#13;
low female/male earnings ratio for sector 8 is again explained by the presence&#13;
of female domestic servants but it is interesting that these earnings ratios&#13;
are higher for the poor sectors. There are either fewer women in higher&#13;
paying occupations or that compared with men, women in higher occupations&#13;
earn less proportionately than in lower paying occupations.&#13;
The DANE surveys do not record the place of work for the workers&#13;
so it is not possible to reach any conclusions about the spatial match of&#13;
residence and work place from these surveys. The 1972 Bogota Urban Develop-&#13;
ment Phase II Household Survey did, however, inquire after workers work&#13;
places and tabulations are available from A. Pachon (1979) in terms of the&#13;
1/ The definition of workers that I have adopted is all those whose&#13;
principal activity is reported as "working" for 1973. For 1977 I&#13;
have added all others (e.g. students) who work more than 15 hours a week.&#13;

City Study Zonification Scheme. The spatial distribution of workers by&#13;
residence in this survey is consistent with the 1973 census and the 1977&#13;
survey. We can therefore regard its results as comparable with the&#13;
sources being used here.&#13;
Table 6.2 reports the residence and employment distributions of&#13;
workers in 1972 by rings as well as sectors. It is clear that Bogota is&#13;
a relatively centralized city with as much as a quarter of all its employ-&#13;
ment in the c.b.d. In comparison a typical large city in the U.S.1/&#13;
has about 10 to 15 percent of all its employment located in the center. New&#13;
York is one of the more centralized cities in the U.S. with about 15 percent&#13;
of its total employment in the c.b.d. The employment density of about 500&#13;
jobs per hectare in the c.b.d. for Bogota may be compared with 890 for New&#13;
York and 630 for Chicago -- cities which are renowned for their skyscrapers.&#13;
Thus the c.b.d. of Bogota not only has a high proportion of all employment&#13;
but is also relatively congested.&#13;
The ring distribution of employment in Table 6.2 also shows that&#13;
the density of employment falls rapidly as one moves to the outer rings.&#13;
Indeed, an exponentially declining employment density function fits the&#13;
ring data surprisingly well. The function estimated was the standard&#13;
density function&#13;
E   =  E   exp (-ax)&#13;
where&#13;
Eo and a are the estimated coefficients. 'a' is the gradient&#13;
and Eo the hypothetical (estimated) density at the center. Ex is the&#13;

employment density at distance x.   Mills-  (1972) showed that these density&#13;
functions have been flattening in U.S. cities over a long period of time.&#13;
His most recent estimates-/ (1963) had an average gradient of 0.26 for&#13;
manufacturing, 0.27 for retailing, 0.33 for services and 0.35 for retailing.&#13;
Here the estimates are&#13;
E   =  256&#13;
0&#13;
and   a  =  0.326              (R      0,95)&#13;
The gradient of 0.326 is surprisingly close to Mills' estimates&#13;
for his sample of the 18 U.S. cities implying that Bogota is as decentralized&#13;
in employment as U.S. cities were in 1963, even though I have shown that its&#13;
c.b.d. has a much higher proportion of employment than U.S. cities. Two&#13;
explanations are possible: first that Mills' 2 point estimation procedure&#13;
produced biased estimates and second, his sample contained relatively&#13;
smaller cities (Philadelphia being the largest) which characteristically&#13;
have steeper density gradients.&#13;
The density of workers by residence is much more even over the&#13;
city and a "crater" can be observed at the center. It is also clear that&#13;
the number of workers exceed jobs in the outer rings implying considerable&#13;
commuting inwards.&#13;
Table 6.2 gives similar distributions by sector. Note that, apart&#13;
from the c.b.d., the highest concentration of jobs is in sectors 4 and 5 -&#13;
Le Corbusier's industrial corridor. It is also significant that there is&#13;
a net deficit of jobs in the poor sectors (2 and 3) and a net excess in the&#13;
rich sectors (7 and 8).&#13;
1/ Mills (1972) estimated these density functions for 18 U.S. cities.&#13;
2/ Mills' estimates are in terms of miles. They are converted to&#13;
kilometers here for comparability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Table 6.3 provides a more detailed picture of the commuting&#13;
pattern in Bogota. The proportion of people living and working in the same&#13;
ring declines as one moves out from the center. It is particularly notice-&#13;
able that from ring 6 almost as many people work in the c.b.d. as in ring 6&#13;
itself. 20 to 30 percent of workers travel to the c.b.d. from every ring.&#13;
The picture is even more interesting when viewed by sectors. About 25 per-&#13;
cent of the workers from each sector work in the c.b.d. However, a glance&#13;
along the diagonal shows that out commuting increases almost as average&#13;
income decreases by sector. Thus, from sector 2 as many as 68 percent of&#13;
workers work outside while only 44 percent do so from sector 8. A very&#13;
small proportion of people commute in to sectors 2 and 3 while sector 8&#13;
receives a significant proportion from every other sector. There is clearly&#13;
a net flow of workers from the poorer to the richer sectors. Sectors 2 and 3&#13;
are therefore somewhat delinked from the rest of the city: many people from&#13;
these sectors travel to other parts of the city for work but few travel in.&#13;
6.2 Migrant Status&#13;
Conventional wisdom has it that migrants are disproportionately&#13;
poor, work in the informal sector and live either in the center of the city&#13;
when they first arrive or in the outskirts. None of these conjectures are&#13;
borne out (though the issue of the informal sector is not addressed here.)&#13;
Table 6.4 shows the distribution of migrants and non-migrants. Female&#13;
migrants are significantly poorer but they are dominated by the large pro-&#13;
portion of domestic servants that form part of that category.   Male migrants&#13;
earn marginally (5%) less than non-migrants in 1973 but 10% more in 1977.&#13;
Thus there is clearly no evidence that migrants are significantly poorer.&#13;
Indeed, the proportion of migrants among the bottom 30 percent is the same&#13;

as non-migrants i.e., 30 percent, Helena Jaramillo (1978) has recently done&#13;
a careful analysis of the characteristics of migrants from the 1973 census&#13;
sample for the whole country. She concludes that migrants earn more than non-&#13;
migrants for all income categories; that migrants of long standing earn more&#13;
than non-migrants; that migrants born in large cities earn more than migrants&#13;
born in small towns who earn more than natives; and lastly migrants earn more&#13;
than non-migrants at all education levels. Table 6.5 reports the distribution&#13;
of workers according to length of residence in years. The data show a strange&#13;
U-shaped pattern. The newest migrants earn more while those of 6 to 10 years&#13;
standing earn the least. The 1973 data are not consistent with this pattern&#13;
where migrants of 3 to 5 years standing earn the least.-/ It may be coinci-&#13;
dental that migrants of 3- 5 years standing in 1973 would all be in the 6 - 10&#13;
year category in 1977 - the group that earns the least. Once again one is&#13;
left with the puzzle of reconciling differences between different sources.&#13;
Are the different patterns a reflection of changes over time or are they&#13;
sampling artefacts? The relatively small proportion of new male migrants&#13;
could reflect a slow down in migration or the undersampling of sector 1/ but&#13;
there is no evidence of concentration of migrants in that sector as shown in&#13;
Table 6.7.&#13;
Tables 6,6 and 6.7 show the spatial distribution of workers by sex&#13;
and length of residence in the city, first by rings and then by radial&#13;
sectors. The distribution of males for each ring is not very different from&#13;
the overall distribution, In particular, recent migrants are distributed&#13;
all over the city in much the same way as everyone else. They are not&#13;
1/ These data refer only to workers hence all children under 12 years of&#13;
age are excluded. Thus native born individuals who could have been&#13;
included in the 1 to 10 years categories do not appear.&#13;
2/ As was mentioned earlier many single individuals live in sector 1 (the&#13;
c.b.d.) who appear to have been under sampled in 1977.&#13;

concentrated in the center nor in the outskirts. The only significant&#13;
deviation is observed in ring 1, the c.b.d. It has a relatively larger pro-&#13;
portion of migrants of 3 to 10 years standing and fewer of greater than 20&#13;
years residence in Bogota. Non-migrants, that is natives, are evenly dis-&#13;
tributed over the city. For women the picture is slightly different. Recent&#13;
migrants are relatively disproportionately represented in rings 1, 3 and 6.&#13;
The picture according to sectors in Table 6.7 is consistent with&#13;
the findings for rings. For males, non-migrants as well as recent migrants&#13;
are relatively overrepresented in the rich sector 8, along with recent female&#13;
migrants. Otherwise, as for rings, each sector has a distribution of workers&#13;
by length of residence that is very similar to that of the city as a whole.&#13;
Note that the poor sector (sector 2) has relatively few recent female&#13;
migrants, counterbalancing the rich sectors 7 and 8. Once again this is&#13;
explained by the presence of domestic servants serving the rich in these rich&#13;
sectors. Their overrepresentation in ring 3 is probably explained by a&#13;
substantial part of the rich sector 8 falling in ring 3.&#13;
In summary, migrants are not particular poor, they are not concentrated&#13;
in any particular part of the city but are, in fact, spread evenly across the&#13;
whole city. The same holds true for recent migrants.&#13;

6.3       An Age-Education-Income Profile&#13;
In this section I present an age-education-income profile of&#13;
workers in Bogota at both the city level as well as disaggregated for all&#13;
the 8 sectors. The human capital model seems to work remarkably well in&#13;
general and the results obtained are as would be expected.-/    The innovation&#13;
offered here is merely spatial disaggregation within the city which provides&#13;
evidence of significant spatial differences within the city.&#13;
Tables 6.8 and 6.9 show the distribution of workers by age group&#13;
and sex for the city as a whole. There is reasonable consistency between&#13;
1973 and 1977 except that the 1977 sample seems to have over sampled older&#13;
male workers and undersampled younger male workers. This has been remarked&#13;
on earlier. Note that women participate in the labor force far more at&#13;
younger ages. The peak of male workers earnings (Table 6.9) occurs&#13;
in the age group 45-54 for both years, while that for women occurs earlier.&#13;
The earnings of women have a much flatter profile and as a result the&#13;
female to male earnings ratio declines with age.   This could be because&#13;
women, on average, have less education but as the following tables will&#13;
show this is not true except in the case of higher education. Women either&#13;
acquire less on-the-job training, for example, because of interruptions&#13;
in their working life enforced by child bearing, or are in lower paying&#13;
occupations or are discriminated against. Clearly, the hypothesis cannot&#13;
be tested in the kind of bivariate tables examined in this paper:    such tests&#13;
will be performed in later more analytical papers in this series.&#13;

The 1973 data show a more pronounced increase in average earnings&#13;
with age than in the 1977 data. This provides further evidence that the&#13;
1977 survey either undersampled the highest earning people or there was&#13;
more under-reporting of earnings at a high level in this suvey.&#13;
Tables 6.10 and 6.11 report the distribution of workers by&#13;
education and sex categories as well as their mean incomes. In both the&#13;
years the proportions of female workers in the primary and secondary&#13;
categories were comparable to those of men but as mentioned above, a&#13;
smaller proportion of female workers have higher education and, consequently,&#13;
many more have no education. The large proportion of no education workers&#13;
may be explained by the presence of a large number of fresh immigrants who are&#13;
young domestic workers.    Here primary education is taken to be 1 to 5 years,&#13;
secondary 6 to 11 years and higher education as over 11 years of schooling.&#13;
The 1977 sample reports a far higher proportion of workers in both the&#13;
secondary as well as higher education categories. This is probably because&#13;
of increasing education levels of the labour force as well as, perhaps,&#13;
some oversampling. Table 6.11 reports the mean incomes by education levels.&#13;
The 1973 incomes seem to increase much more with the level of education than&#13;
in 1977. It may be recalled that the 1973 census income information does&#13;
not distinguish between labour earnings and other non-labor incomes. This&#13;
may partially account for the higher multiples of earnings obtained for higher&#13;
education in 1973. In addition, the fact that the proportions of people in&#13;
the higher education category have increased might indicate that people with&#13;
higher education are now less scarce and that the average level of quality in&#13;
that category may have decreased as well. The difference between the 1973&#13;
and 1977 is, however, so large, that this is additional confirmation that in&#13;

1977 the highest earnings were underreported. The female to male ratio&#13;
of earnings does not show much of a trend: they appear to be about a half&#13;
at all education levels. Female earnings increase at a lower rate with&#13;
education than do those for men.&#13;
The above is merely by way of confirming what is expected to&#13;
exist for the city of Bogota as a whole. What is more interesting is&#13;
that these patterns hold up for the sectors separately but each with a&#13;
different profile.&#13;
The distribution of workers by age group and education level&#13;
along with mean incomes for each group is given in Appendix Tables A6.1&#13;
and A6.2. Figures 3a and 3b give a graphical description of the data.&#13;
Consider Figure 3a which gives the age-income profile for each sector.&#13;
Mean incomes are in the order of overall ranking of the 7 sectors (excluding&#13;
Sector 1, the c.b.d.), i.e. in the descending order 8,7,5,4,6,3,2 for each&#13;
age group. There are almost no irregularities.&#13;
The poorer sector 2,3 and 6 have a flatter profile than the richer&#13;
sectors 4,5,7 and 8. It may be hypothesized therefore that people in the&#13;
poorer sectors have lower expectations of improvement over time: if the&#13;
cross section they observe around them in their neighborhoods is any guide.&#13;
Presumably those who do gain in income move to more attractive locales.&#13;
It may be recalled, however, from Table 6.7 that every sector had a large&#13;
proportion of its population who had lived in Bogota for over 10 years. While&#13;
these data do not permit any inferences regarding intra-city mobility of&#13;
households it is unlikely that residents of a poor sector who have been in&#13;
Bogota for a long time have moved downwards. It is therefore reasonable&#13;
to conclude that a significant proportion of people in poor neighborhoods have&#13;
lived in poor sections of the city for the majority of their lives.&#13;

Now consider Figure 3b which gives the education income profile&#13;
for each sector. At even each education level people in the richer sectors&#13;
earn more than in the poorer sectors and again in the same order (there is&#13;
some crossing over at the higher education level). The differential&#13;
between the sectors increases along with higher education levels. If&#13;
these patterns hold up with multivariate analysis it would, indeed, be&#13;
surprising that returns to schooling differ for people living in different&#13;
locations.   Some of the variation evident in Figure 3b is no doubt caused&#13;
by differing mean years of schooling between the sectors since various years&#13;
of schooling are grouped into 4 levels. Except for Sector 2, there would appear&#13;
to be exponential increases in the level of earnings with education. A log&#13;
linear specification of the human capital model would then be expected to&#13;
work quite well even at the disaggregated level of the sectors. Different&#13;
coefficients, would, however, be obtained implying differing rates of return&#13;
to education by sector.&#13;
The next step is to control for education income effects by&#13;
age. The distribution of workers (males and females) by both age groups&#13;
and education levels is given in Table 6.12. One interesting feature is&#13;
immediately apparent. The peak income occurs at a higher age, the higher&#13;
the education level. This is graphed in Figure 3c and the circled numbers&#13;
in Table 13 are the peaks in each education level. Figure 3c shows the&#13;
human capital model to be clearly working for Bogota and the standard&#13;
specification of the logarithm of income with education, experience and&#13;
(experience) would clearly suffice. Figure 3c provides an interesting&#13;
comparison with Figure 3a. The higher education-age-income profile in&#13;
Figure 3c is quite similar to that of sector 8 age-income-profile. The&#13;
primary education profile is similar to that of sector 2. The other sectors&#13;

correspond roughly to the secondary education profile. The distribution&#13;
of workers by age. and education by sector is tabulated in Tables A6.3 and&#13;
A6.4 in: the Appendix. The similarities noted above between the education&#13;
level profiles and the sectoral profiles are not, of course, accidental.&#13;
Of all workers in sector 2, about 60 percent are at the primary education&#13;
level. Of all workers in sector 8, about 34 percent have higher education.&#13;
These constitute the extremes of the spectrum. The age-income profiles&#13;
controlling for education are graphed for each sector in Figure 4. These&#13;
graphs are for all workers. Some of the regularities are lost becuase&#13;
of the inclusion of female workers but enough remain to warrant the&#13;
retention of the hypothesis that returns to schooling differ systematically&#13;
by sector. It may be noted that the differences in magnitude between the&#13;
sectors increase with education level.&#13;
Is it reasonable to hypothesize that within a city the location of&#13;
residence causes the different rate of return to education hypothesized above.&#13;
The hypothesis clearly needs to be tested more systematically, but a few&#13;
conjectures may be offered. Is the labor market, in fact segmented, in&#13;
this manner? The conjecture is that location is acting as a proxy for other&#13;
unmeasured variables. One can expect that qualify of schooling differs by&#13;
location in the city -/ and the years of schooling variable clearly ignores&#13;
quality differences. Parents education and income which may determine location&#13;
within the city in the first place then affect the childs' schooling by&#13;
virtue of location. Location in a low income neighborhood can also affect&#13;
a person's network of contacts for obtaining a high income job/      Since the&#13;
lower income neighborhoods show rather flat age-earnings profiles one can&#13;
1/ This, of course, is a familiar phenomenon within U. S. cities.&#13;
2/ McGregor (1977) makes a similar point in an investigation of variations in&#13;
the duration of unemployment in Glasgow. Duration of unemployment was&#13;
found to be higher in poor neighborhoods after controlling for all other standard&#13;
variables (age, education, sex, etc.)&#13;

also expect that the demonstration effect dampens its residents' expectations&#13;
and aspirations. This can have a cumulative effect on earnings similar to&#13;
the discouraged worker hypothesis for non-participators. Finally, location&#13;
of residence is also a proxy for social class which probably has a non-&#13;
trivial effect on earnings. The larger question is if this pattern is&#13;
peculiar to Bogota or if it exists in other cities as well. Clearly, all&#13;
cities have their poor and rich neighborhoods but the question is if they&#13;
are clustered in the way they are in Bogota. The clustering found in Bogota&#13;
probably exacerbates the disadvantages of individuals born to poor parents&#13;
which cannot be ameliorated by schooling. Is there much spatial mobility or&#13;
is the cross-section evidence found generalizable over time? Only cross-&#13;
section data have been examined here so it is difficult to derive any con-&#13;
clusions about patterns over time. The question of concern is if potential&#13;
earnings (or permanent income) are affected by virtue of location in&#13;
different parts of the city, rather than current earnings. Such questions&#13;
can only be answered with the use of panel data but which do not yet exist&#13;
in Colombia. Some progress, however, can be made if retrospective inquiries&#13;
are included in future questionnaires.&#13;
6.4       A Profile of Workers by Occupation&#13;
This section examines the occupational distribution of workers in&#13;
Bogota and then looks at their location of residence. Once again, the&#13;
sectors have distinct characteristics according to occupation and income.&#13;
The distribution of workers by occupation for the city as a whole&#13;
is provided in Table 6.13 for 1973 and 1977. Broadly, the distributions are&#13;
similar but there are some discrepancies. The 1977 sample has a far greater&#13;

proportion of professional and technical workers and of administrators and&#13;
managers but their incomes have not increased to cover inflation of about&#13;
150 percent between those two years. The overall mean income has kept up&#13;
and perhaps increased slightly (10% in real terms). Maids comprise about a&#13;
quarter of all female workers which implies that there must be about 100,000&#13;
female domestic servants in Bogota, one to every 5 or 6 households on&#13;
average. Their income is reported as being significantly higher in 1977&#13;
than those reported in 1973. In fact they increased about 2 1/2 times in&#13;
real terms. This is mainly due to improved coverage of their income in kind&#13;
which was characteristically neglected in the census. There are far fewer&#13;
production supervisors in 1977 as compared with 1973, but the incomes of&#13;
those covered are about double in real terms. The proportion of construction&#13;
workers has also decreased but this may reflect a real decrease since there&#13;
was a building boom in 1973. (Construction workers were one of the main&#13;
categories among the underemployed in 1977). Only about a quarter of all&#13;
workers are categorized as production workers and they are among the lowest&#13;
paid groups. The only groups paid significantly less than production workers&#13;
are construction workers and domestic servants. Among women, even maids are&#13;
paid higher than production workers. Sales workers earn almost one and half&#13;
times as much as production workers. The corollary is that a large propor-&#13;
tion of Bogota's poor therefore are production workers. Thus measures to&#13;
promote small scale industry might, paradoxically, promote poverty rather&#13;
than alleviating it! The problem is more of low productivity rather than&#13;
lack of jobs. The coefficient of variation is high for service jobs as&#13;
compared with that for production and construction workers. Thus there are&#13;
a large number of poor production workers and some service workers as well.&#13;

Women's incomes range from 40 to 80 percent of male incomes depending on&#13;
occupation.&#13;
The distribution of workers by occupation was examined at the&#13;
comuna level and quite identifiable patterns were found to exist. Appendix&#13;
Table A6.5 gives the occupational distribution of all workers by sectors&#13;
for both the years 1973 and 1977. Occupations are distributed locationally&#13;
essentially in the order of their mean incomes. The distribution between&#13;
1973 and 1977 does not change significantly. Table 6.14 summarizes the&#13;
information in Table A6.5 and presents "indexes of concentration" for the&#13;
occupations. The index merely reflects the proportion of workers in occupa-&#13;
tion i who live in sector, j relative to the proportion of all workers&#13;
present in the sector.-/ If all occupations were distributed uniformly&#13;
across the city all indexes would be 100. The circled sets of figures show&#13;
the cases where the index is 120 or greater. The highlights of the con-&#13;
centrations are shown in Map 7. It is readily apparent that sectors 2 and&#13;
6 are somewhat similar in that production, construction and transport workers&#13;
are over-represented in those sectors--all being low income occupations.&#13;
Sector 2 also has an over-representation of service and sales workers.&#13;
Sector 3 has clerks and typists but also production and transport workers.&#13;
Sectors 4 and 5 constitute the industrial corridor. Production workers and&#13;
supervisors are over-represented in both these sectors. The data for&#13;
sector 5 indicate that production supervisors may have been reclassified&#13;
as administrators and managers in 1977. Thus production supervisors are&#13;
over-represented, in 1973 and administrators and managers in 1977. Sales&#13;
1/ Thus, in 1973 for example, 39.5 percent of construction workers lived in&#13;
sector 1 while only 29.1 percent of all workers lived there. The index&#13;
is therefore (39.5 x 100/29.1) = 136. Hoover and Vernon (1959) called&#13;
this 'The Index of Occupational Specialisation' (p. 284).&#13;

people also are over-represented in sector 4.   Sectors 7 and 8 are quite&#13;
different from the others with a concentration of professionals, administra-&#13;
tors and their maids. The center (sector 1) specializes in the residence&#13;
of sales and service workers as might be expected. It is interesting to&#13;
note that construction workers live predominantly in the periphery while&#13;
presumably much of the construction is carried out in the center and&#13;
affluent North. Information on employment location will help interpret the&#13;
location pattern found here. A majority of large manufacturing is, in fact,&#13;
located in the industrial corridor of sectors 4 and 5 and presumably a large&#13;
amount of retail and service employment in the central comunas 31 and 81.&#13;
However, we have as yet little information on the location of employment&#13;
except for large manufacturing. It would be of interest to find the center/&#13;
periphery proportions, since a large majority of the poor live in the outer&#13;
sectors 1 and 4.&#13;
Having shown that workers are concentrated by occupation in&#13;
particular sectors, it is useful to observe the characteristics of workers&#13;
in each occupation across sectors since each sector does have all occupa-&#13;
tions represented. Figure 5 illustrates the mean incomes of each occupation&#13;
by sector. Sector 7 has been omitted since it is similar to sector 8 and&#13;
sectors 4, 5 and 2 are omitted because they are mixed in character. The&#13;
pattern is clear once again. The ranking of sectors by income persists&#13;
even when controlled by occupations. The order of occupations is arbitrarily&#13;
arranged in descending order by incomes to highlight the pattern. People in&#13;
the same occupation earn different incomes according to sector of residence.&#13;
Sector 2 is similar to sector 6 though the latter is consistently above it.&#13;
This picture further reinforces the evidence presented so far of income&#13;
segregation by sector along with other associated characteristics.&#13;

In summary, it is clear that people with specific occupations&#13;
cluster in specific sectors but the ordering appears to be dictated by&#13;
income.&#13;
6.5       A Profile of Workers by Industry of Activity&#13;
The distribution of workers by industry of activity is consistent&#13;
with that by occupation but provides further information on their charac-&#13;
teristics. Table 6.15 presents the distribution and mean incomes by activity&#13;
for both 1973 and 1977. There are a number of discrepancies apparent between&#13;
the two years. In general, manufacturing seems to be under-represented in&#13;
1977 while commerce and services are over-represented. In this case, how-&#13;
ever, the distributions for 1977 are probably nearer the truth because they&#13;
are consistent with most household surveys. The 1973 census suffered from&#13;
a large proportion of no response to this item--a proportion much larger&#13;
than that for occupation. It may be conjectured that manufacturing is&#13;
easier to characterize for a respondent than service and trade activities.&#13;
Thus, the 1973 census may have resulted in a larger proportion of workers&#13;
in manufacturing among those who responded to the question.-/&#13;
Women predominate in domestic service and retail trade--these&#13;
two categories account for almost half of all female employment. In&#13;
manufacturing, a large proportion of women work in textiles and footwear&#13;
as might be expected. They are also present in large numbers in public in-&#13;
struction i.e. teaching. Together these 4 categories above account for 70&#13;
percent of all female employment. For males in 1977, about 27 percent were&#13;
in manufacturing, 12 percent in construction and 17 percent in commerce.&#13;
1/ DANE publications for the 1973 census report a distribution quite different&#13;
than the one presented here, and more consistent with household surveys.&#13;

Within manufacturing there is no bunching up as there is in textiles&#13;
and footwear for women. Incomes are in the order expected: those in manu-&#13;
facturing and construction are low while high in financial establishments,&#13;
public administration, wholesale trade and teaching which are all white&#13;
collar activities.&#13;
The spatial distribution of workers by their industry of activity&#13;
is presented in Appendix tables A6.6a and A6.6b for 1973 and 1977&#13;
respectively. Indexes of concentration similar to those for occupation are&#13;
constructed and presented in Table 6.16. The further disaggregation of&#13;
manufacturing provides further interesting information. Indexes greater&#13;
than 115 are circled to highlight the areas of concentration. While manu-&#13;
facturing workers are concentrated in sectors 2, 3 and 4 as might be expected&#13;
from earlier information on production workers, there is further specializa-&#13;
tion within manufacturing. Those in industrial chemicals and metal industry&#13;
along with those in paper and printing tend to be over-represented in&#13;
sectors 4, 5 and 6. A glance at Table 6.15 reveals that these are the areas&#13;
in manufacturing where earnings are higher, hence their greater concentration&#13;
in sectors 4, 5 and 6 rather than in 2. Sector 4 specializes in commerce&#13;
and also in textiles and footwear. If it is not merely a sampling artefact,&#13;
the data for sector 6 reveal an increasing concentration of manufacturing&#13;
workers in 1977 relative to 1973. Construction workers are also concentrated&#13;
here. With large manufacturing moving outward in the industrial corridor of&#13;
sectors 4 and 5 it would not be surprising if there was indeed a movement of&#13;
manufacturing workers to sector 6. As expected, white collars i.e.&#13;
financial establishments, wholesale trade, public instruction and public&#13;
administration are concentrated in sectors 7 and 8 along with their domestic&#13;
&#13;

negligible proportion of the Bogota labor force.&#13;
Once again a distinct spatial pattern is observed between the&#13;
sectors with workers classified by their industry of activity. Figure 6&#13;
illustrates the mean incomes in each sector by activity and a picture&#13;
similar to that of Figure 5 is obtained. Workers in the same activity&#13;
receive different incomes according to sector of residence. The pattern&#13;
is again remarkably regular. Activities were arranged arbitrarily to&#13;
income for ease of illustration of the pattern.&#13;

6.6       Summary&#13;
This section has examined the distribution of workers in Bogota&#13;
according to their zone of residence.   Each of the 8 sectors differed from&#13;
the others according to the incomes of workers.   Overall, women are found&#13;
to earn about half as much as men but the ratio is somewhat higher in the&#13;
poorer parts of, the,city. This is partly because a large proportion of the&#13;
female labor force, almost a third, are maids while there are few men in&#13;
this low income occupation.   It is also the case that there are few women&#13;
in higher incomesoccupations and those who are there earn proportionately&#13;
less.&#13;
Bogota is found to be quite centralized in employment:   the center&#13;
or central business district has about a quarter of all employment as com-&#13;
pared to about 10 to 15 percent for a typical North American city. The&#13;
density of employment in the center is very high but it then declines&#13;
exponentially as one moves to the periphery. The poor areas of the city&#13;
located mainly in the South have a net deficit of jobs as compared with&#13;
residences while the rich North has a corresponding surplus. Consequently&#13;
the poor South has very little in-commuting and is therefore somewhat&#13;
delinked from the rest of the city. People living in the poor South are,&#13;
in that sense, spatially disadvantaged.&#13;
The distinctions between the sectors become more apparent when&#13;
the age - education - income profiles of workers are examined. As one would&#13;
expect, people with less education have flatter income profiles than those&#13;
with more. But what is interesting is that the poorer sectors have&#13;
relatively flat profiles and that even people with higher education in&#13;
these sectors earn less than those with similar levels of education in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

richer sectors. This provides further evidence that workers living in&#13;
poorer sectors are disadvantaged. Whether residence in poor areas of the&#13;
city causes or reinforces poverty is not tested here: only the correla-&#13;
tions are clear. Only a multivariate model framework could begin to&#13;
disentangle the various effects on income. At this stage, the idea that&#13;
place of residence has a bearing on potential earnings (or permanent&#13;
income) remains a mere hypothesis, but one worth testing systematically.&#13;
Migrants are found to be distributed uniformly all over:&#13;
they are not over-represented in the periphery and only mildly so in the&#13;
center. They are not found to be poorer either: indeed, recent&#13;
immigrants appear to earn more than those of somewhat longer standing.&#13;
Conventionally wisdom is therefore not supported on either of these&#13;
points.&#13;
Production workers are found to be among the least paid members&#13;
of the labor force along with the low paid service workers, the variance&#13;
of income being much higher among the latter. Thus the majority of&#13;
production workers are found in the poorer sectors of the city. Workers&#13;
with similar occupations and activity appear to receive different incomes&#13;
according to sector of residence.&#13;

VII. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
This paper has attempted to provide a profile of the population&#13;
of Bogota as part of a larger study which seeks to study and explain the&#13;
economic structure of a city in a poor country. This has been done in the&#13;
historical context of a very rapid process of urbanization that Colombia&#13;
has undergone in this century. This section collects some of the larger&#13;
questions that have emerged from this study in order to provide a focus&#13;
for further work.&#13;
7.1       Data Problems                    -&#13;
A problem that has been addressed repeatedly in this study is one&#13;
of data reliability. That data are not exact is clearly not a new discovery.&#13;
The problem that I have suggested is somewhat more serious: how do we know&#13;
what we know and when do we decide that we know it? Many operational deci-&#13;
sions are made on the basis of small samples of data. This is necessary&#13;
otherwise data collection itself will require more time than the action for&#13;
which it is needed. A census, after all, cannot be undertaken annually or&#13;
even every quinquenium. Statistical theory, of course, tells us the size&#13;
of a sample that is necessary for a required degree of accuracy but the&#13;
problem is really that such a sample is carried out to ensure that the&#13;
distribution of a particular variable is captured adequately, for example,&#13;
income. A number of problems arise as a result of this procedure.&#13;
Firstly, some knowledge of the universe is needed such that a&#13;
sample may be systematically selected. Usually, the universe is a popula-&#13;
tion census which necessarily has to be used for a period of 10-odd years&#13;
until the next census. Again, this is not a problem if the universe does&#13;
not change, but the pace of change in less developed countries is fast and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -&#13;
currently a large city typically grows at five percent a year which implies&#13;
that within five years it adds about a quarter of itself on. Meanwhile&#13;
surveys are undertaken on the basis of the old census with the result that&#13;
few conclusions can be drawn about changes resulting from this growth. It&#13;
does not matter if the distribution of the addition is similar to the old;&#13;
but we do not know if it is so and we have few ways of finding out since our&#13;
sample itself is based on the old.&#13;
Secondly, the universe from which the sample is selected is itself&#13;
likely to be flawed since it may be hypothesized that the quality of informa-&#13;
tion collected is directly proportional to the size of sample sought. Thus,&#13;
to continue with the same example, the quality of income data is likely to&#13;
be low in a census. If the quality is systematically correlated with income&#13;
itself, all later samples will be mis-sampled as a result.&#13;
The point of making these rather elementary statistical observations&#13;
is not to say that household surveys should not be used at all; or that only&#13;
censuses should be used; or that all analysis should be stopped; but that we&#13;
need to be far more circumspect in the use of data than we, as economists,&#13;
usually are. My detailed spatial analysis also demonstrates the risks attached&#13;
with not being familiar with the details and specifics about the coverage of&#13;
a particular survey. This applies more particularly to those of us who&#13;
typically work in countries or locales not our own and use data sets collected&#13;
at some distance. Consequently, small changes in the distribution of income,&#13;
in the characteristics of industrial structure, etc. are, I would contend,&#13;
virtually impossible to measure by utilizing sample surveys over a period of&#13;
time, unless we know the universe being measured; in which case we won't need&#13;
to measure it.&#13;
&#13;

7.2       The Course of Urbanization&#13;
Colombia is probably quite similar to many other Latin American&#13;
countries and to other middle income countries in the world in the process&#13;
of development and urbanization that it has experienced in this century.&#13;
The structure of the country has been transformed in a radical way during&#13;
this period: a transformation that is essentially unprecedented in its&#13;
pace of change. Thus, the thinking of policy makers is dominated by an&#13;
assumption of continuing rapid change in the growth of urban areas. What&#13;
has been shown in the early sections of this paper is that Bogota in parti-&#13;
cular, and Colombia in general, may now be in the process of. another change&#13;
that might be almost as difficult to adjust to as the earlier process of&#13;
rapid change. If the process of urbanization in general and the growth of&#13;
city in particular is regarded as following a logistical path, it appears&#13;
that Colombia is now at the turning point of the curve and future rates of&#13;
urbanization are going to be lower than they have been over the past fifty&#13;
years. While this is partly a pure mathematical effect of the logical&#13;
limit of 100 percernt urbanization which can only be approached asymptotically,&#13;
the turning point may be occurring in Colombia somewhat earlier than expected&#13;
because of the stage of demographic transition. Fertility rates appear to&#13;
have declined drastically in a very short period of time. Part of this&#13;
change is an intrinsic component of the process of urbanization but part is&#13;
no doubt due to exogenous factors such as increasing average levels of&#13;
education and better medical facilities. The lesson of all this is essen-&#13;
tially that policy makers in middle income developing countries will now&#13;
need to redirect their energies from the problems of fast expanding cities&#13;
to those of slowly growing cities. Projections showing the existence of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ill -&#13;
megalopoli of 30 million people will need to be revised. The process of&#13;
urban planning will need to take more explicit account of the developmental&#13;
and structural changes that accompany urbanization and their effects in&#13;
the growth of particular cities.&#13;
7.3       The Changing Internal Structure of a City Undergoing Rapid Growth&#13;
The evidence examined in this paper suggests some similarities&#13;
as well as differences between the structure of North American cities and&#13;
Bogota. The stylized facts about North American cities are that they have&#13;
decentralized in terms of both population, as well as employment over the&#13;
past fifty years. Central city densities have actually declined and any&#13;
growth that has taken place has been on the periphery. Accompanying this&#13;
process has been decay of central cities and the flight of high income house-&#13;
holds to suburbs. If decentralization is measured purely in terms of&#13;
declining population and employment density gradients, it would be easy&#13;
to reach the conclusion that South American cities are very similar to those&#13;
in the North. The truth, however, is more complex. The evidence from&#13;
Bogota indicates that the density gradient has, indeed, declined for popu-&#13;
lation. However, densities have risen all over the city (except in the&#13;
CBD). At the same time, city boundaries appear to have been extended&#13;
periodically with the effect of keeping average population density roughly&#13;
constant. Rates of growth in the periphery are clearly the highest but&#13;
absolute magnitudes of increase in the inner rings match those in the peri-&#13;
phery. This is clearly the result of a high growth situation where, in a&#13;
sense, people are locating wherever there is space available. In the U.S.,&#13;
actual movements have taken place from central cities to suburbs and popu-&#13;
lations of central cities have declined in absolute terms. What will happen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
in cities in developing countries in the future when populations begin to&#13;
stabilize is difficult to predict. The trends in energy prices suggest&#13;
that transport costs will now increase--reversing a long time decreasing&#13;
trend. It is possible, therefore, that the city of the future will be more&#13;
dense than those observed in rich cities now. The rich in Bogota have&#13;
exhibited a trend of moving toward the periphery but only in one direction--&#13;
a direction which appears to be historically determined. This pattern is&#13;
not very different from those observed by Homer Hoyt for U.S. cities.&#13;
However, the current broad pattern of income distribution in U.S. cities&#13;
in general is that of poor residing in the centre and the rich in the&#13;
suburbs. There is some concern that as jobs have moved to the suburbs along&#13;
with the residence of the rich, the poor living in the center are increas-&#13;
ingly disadvantaged spatially: A similar pattern seems to exist in Bogota&#13;
except that the income segregation is by radial sectors rather than by rings.&#13;
The poor areas are clearly short of jobs as compared with the rich and the&#13;
residents of these areas are in that sense disadvantaged spatially. Further&#13;
research in other cities would provide a better idea of general patterns&#13;
in cities in developing countries but the evidence from Bogota indicates&#13;
that care needs to be exercised in extrapolating trends from U.S. cities&#13;
to the developing world.&#13;
7.4       Income Segregation in Bogota&#13;
The city is clearly highly segregated spatially by income and&#13;
there is -little evidence that there is any tendency for it to change in&#13;
this respect. The key question here is if this is a general pattern over&#13;
many cities at similar income levels? Is such a pattern related to the&#13;
pattern of overall income distribution? Do we expect cities with higher&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
degrees of income inequality to be more spatially segregated as well?&#13;
Furthermore, the income segregation in Bogota is radial rather than circum-&#13;
ferential. The rich are concentrated in one sector in the North, rather&#13;
than in an outer ring as is thought to be the case in many U.S. cities.&#13;
Is this a result of some systematic reasons or is it historical accident?&#13;
Did the North provide faster access to the centre than the other directions?&#13;
Does a higher level of inequality also imply a tendency for radial segregation&#13;
so that the poorest and richest are kept at a more than striking distance?&#13;
Where do the different income classes work? We know where large manufac-&#13;
turing is located but not much about the rest of employment. However, it&#13;
was shown that large manufacturing accounts for only about 10-15 percent of&#13;
total employment, thus the employment location of other activities is neces-&#13;
sary for drawing conclusions about the employment/residence interaction.&#13;
Indeed, the pattern of such interaction when distinguished by income class&#13;
of the workers will provide some clues about the future pattern of growth&#13;
of the city. If we assume that the rich are the trend setters in such&#13;
matters their mode of work interaction with others will help determine the&#13;
potential movements of the others. Given that few of the rich work in&#13;
production activities, the charting of tertiary employment assumes even&#13;
greater importance.&#13;
7.5       Migrants&#13;
Migrants are not especially poor; they do not concentrate in&#13;
specific areas of the city--the centre or the periphery--(except for domestic&#13;
servants); they are not concentrated in particular occupations nor activities;&#13;
they are not less educated, nor, perhaps, less skilled than the natives.&#13;
Such are the indications from the data counter to the popular ideas of poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114 -&#13;
migrants streaming into the city. That more of them are poor is merely a&#13;
reflection of more of the whole country as well as the city being poor.&#13;
Furthermore, there is little evidence that they are disadvantaged in the&#13;
job market. One might even say that they are basically "normal" people and&#13;
consequently the less urban poverty problems are associated with migrants&#13;
the better will be the chances of alleviating it, or at least analyzing it.&#13;
7.6       Segmentation&#13;
No real tests of segmentation have been made in this paper so only&#13;
some conjectures can be offered.-/ First, some points need to be made about&#13;
the formal/informal sector dichotomy. The formal sector is usually taken&#13;
to include all professionals, technical persons, managers and administrators,&#13;
the government sector, and firms above a certain size who are then assumed&#13;
to be protected in some sense. The interesting feature that appears from&#13;
the evidence examined is that production or manufacturing workers are among&#13;
the lowest paid and manufacturing (S.I.C. code 3) has the highest concen-&#13;
tration of large firms. Is it then the case that the large majority of&#13;
workers in what is normally taken to be the protected sector are among the&#13;
lowest paid? Where is then the protection that they are said to enjoy?&#13;
Such a possibility needs to be tested more rigorously but the different&#13;
estimates of firm size distribution given from different sources makes it&#13;
difficult to perform such a test conclusively. At a minimum, however, the&#13;
evidence offered in this paper questions the real existence of a protected&#13;
sector. If one exists it might in fact exist in services. The corollary&#13;
of such a finding might be that efforts at relieving urban poverty ought to&#13;
1/ A more detailed examination of the segmentation issue is conducted in&#13;
another city study paper by Gary Fields (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -&#13;
concentrate on the provision of services (health, education, transportation,&#13;
roads, etc.) which are directly related to improvement of welfare as well&#13;
as being income generating.&#13;
Income variation is clearly related to variation in investments in&#13;
human capital but also it would appear, to occupation, type of activity, and&#13;
location of residence of the worker. I have cautioned against these other&#13;
classifications being used as causes rather than mere proxies of other&#13;
variables. The main point here is that consideration of these other classi-&#13;
fication points, at a minimum, to clusters of correlates which can then be&#13;
used as targets of policy attacks. If it is indeed the case that a person&#13;
born and raised in a poor sector of the city, because of that fact attends&#13;
a low quality school, acquires low aspirations, develops a poor network of&#13;
contacts, etc., and is consequently assured of a low and flat age-income&#13;
profile, it is of little relevance nor comfort to him to say that the human&#13;
capital model works, that the market is not segmented, and therefore no policy&#13;
interventions are required. If alleviation of poverty is indeed a goal, such&#13;
spatial segregation and resulting deprivation points to direct policy actions&#13;
such as the provision of good schools and health centres within such locations,&#13;
rather than the assertion of an argument which says that the real problem is&#13;
of income generation and the rest will follow. The latter would never happen&#13;
because of the above mentioned correlates of poverty reinforced by spatial&#13;
segregation. Much of the above rests on an assumption of relatively low real&#13;
mobility within the city, where lateral movement between neighborhoods of&#13;
similar qualities is not regarded as mobility. In summary, the hypothesis&#13;
here is that spatial segregation such as that existing in Bogota hampers labor&#13;
market mobility and therefore promotes labor market segmentation, though not,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116 -&#13;
perhaps, in such a way that would pass a strict test of segmentation. Tests&#13;
of this hypothesis include the confirmation of the existence of differing&#13;
rates of return to education in different sectors of the city as has been&#13;
suggested in this paper.&#13;
The last point that I would like to make in this section is a&#13;
comment on the observation that different occupations yield quite different&#13;
earnings. If it is the case that occupation/earnings heterogeneity stands&#13;
up even when adjusted for age and education then it must be that people are&#13;
relatively rich and poor partly by choice.   Or is it ignorance in one's&#13;
formative years? If unskilled production and construction workers earn less&#13;
than the others (also unskilled) why do people choose that occupation? Pre-&#13;
sumably preference would be a large part of the explanation. It follows then&#13;
that changing the poor's preference structure would aid in the alleviation of&#13;
poverty and, incidentally, income generation in general would benefit as well.&#13;
If occupations are indeed concentrated in certain areas, it also implies&#13;
that higher income occupations should be generated in that area--a policy&#13;
that might have an effect on the structure of preferences.&#13;

APPENDIX 1&#13;
A TECHNICAL NOTE ON THE CALCULATION OF INCOMES&#13;
1/&#13;
DANE-/ household surveys are now conducted quarterly in the four&#13;
largest cities (Bogota, Medellin, Cali and Barranquilla) and in the seven&#13;
largest alternatingly, mainly to study urban employment and unemployment&#13;
and the characteristics of the labor force. Characteristically incomes are&#13;
reported in the following manner:&#13;
1. For Employees (of all kinds): (a) Cash income from employ-&#13;
ment is reported according to periodicity of payment which has 5 categories:&#13;
monthly, fortnightly, every 10 days, weekly and daily. The multiple used&#13;
to convert these incomes into monthly equivalents were as follows:&#13;
monthly                  -     1&#13;
fortnightly (quincenal) -      2&#13;
ten days                -      3.04  (365    1  )&#13;
1o     12&#13;
weekly                   -     4.33  (52/12)&#13;
daily                    -    21.75&#13;
This method obviously overstates income for those workers who are&#13;
paid at less than a month's periodicity and do not work the whole month.&#13;
However, less than 5% of the workers report that they are paid daily (where&#13;
error is most likely) so the overall effect of this computation is not&#13;
likely to be unreasonable.   (b) Value of income received in kind (food,&#13;
shelter, clothing) is reported separately. Total labor income was then&#13;
computed for employees as the sum of (a) and (b).&#13;
2. Employers and Self Employed: The question asked is "Net&#13;
earnings last month from job." This was interpreted as labor income al-&#13;
though that is not strictly correct for the self employed.&#13;

Statistical Office).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. All: Income sources other than employment which are&#13;
categorized as interest, rents, pensions, cash aid and other were assumed&#13;
to comprise each individual's.non-labor income.&#13;
Consequently, each individual reporting any income had 2 types&#13;
of income: labor income and non-labor income.&#13;
4. No Information: A large proportion of the sample - about 20% -&#13;
did not report their incomes but did give all-other characteristics. They&#13;
could not-be omitted from the sample because they were not uniformly&#13;
distributed over the sample but were concentrated among sales workers and&#13;
sales managers and proprietors - as might be expected. The method used for&#13;
imputing income was similar to the method used by the U.S. Census Bureau.&#13;
The objective is to impute incomes such that the new distribution retains&#13;
the "true" mean and variance values.&#13;
As the file was read a 19 x 4 x 4 matrix was created with the&#13;
following dimensions:&#13;
- Workers were classified - as employees and self employed by&#13;
sex and 3 categories of place of residence which yields 12 groups.&#13;
- Male employers were classified by the 3 categories of place&#13;
of residence which yields 3 additional groups.&#13;
Female employers constituted one group and domestic servants&#13;
from the three residence categories formed the remaining 3 groups to form&#13;
a total of 19 groups.&#13;
-  Four categories of years of education (0), (1-5), (6-11), (12+)&#13;
were used and 4 categories of years of experience (0-1), (2-4), (5-9) and&#13;
(10+0) were used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -&#13;
Each cell of the resulting 19 x 4 x 4 matrix then contained&#13;
the income of the most recently read record with these characteristics.&#13;
The records with missing income were then given the income of the most&#13;
recently read record with the same characteristics.&#13;
The rationale behind this procedure may be seen as follows:&#13;
Consider the distribution f (ytIxt;e which is the estimated distri-&#13;
bution of income yt of individuals given their vector of characteristics xt,&#13;
the estimated vector of parameters being 0. Such a distribution may be&#13;
estimated from the set of individuals with known incomes and characteristics&#13;
which will give 0.&#13;
The procedure described above approximates imputing income to the&#13;
non-respondents by a random drawing from the above distribution estimated&#13;
from the set of individuals with known incomes from the sample. If n&#13;
drawings were made n = 1, 2 ..., then the average Ytn = 1 n    EYti&#13;
n  i=l&#13;
could be used as the predictor.   But  ytn  -  Yt as n     00&#13;
where yt = E [ y t xt;O]. Thus, the expected value of incomes generated&#13;
by the method used (method 1) is the same as that that would be generated by&#13;
method (2) where the non-respondents have imputed incomes given by&#13;
Yt =E [Y t lyti]'&#13;
This would be the result if income equations were estimated and&#13;
then used to impute incomes to the non-respondents. Method (1), results&#13;
in greater variance than method (2). Method (2) gives the Best Linear&#13;
Unbiased Estimator for the missing incomes but in giving the non-respondents&#13;
with characteristics xt, the mean income of respondents with characteristics&#13;
xt, the effect is a reduction in variance of the overall sample: an&#13;
undesirable result where we are interested in retaining both the central&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12C -&#13;
value and dispersion characteristics of the parent sample.-/&#13;
Another way of interpreting this method is to view it as utilizing&#13;
extra "non-economic" variables which would not normally be captured in a&#13;
standard human capital type predictive equation.&#13;
Further support for this type of an imputation method is provided&#13;
by Ruggles and Ruggles (1974) in a paper concerned with strategies for&#13;
merging and matching microdata sets. It is best to quote them directly&#13;
(p. 354):&#13;
"The use of a matching process has important methodological&#13;
implications. Imputation by regression would normally result in&#13;
assigning mean values, whereas the matching technique reproduces&#13;
the distributions of values in the original data set. For a&#13;
single imputation the mean value may be desirable, but for re-&#13;
peated imputations the use of mean values destroys the observed&#13;
variance. The success of the matching technique depends on the&#13;
data being quite dense, so that similar cases can be found in&#13;
both data sets. It should also be noted that for matching&#13;
purposes no specific functional relationship need be determined&#13;
in advance. Non-linear relationships will automatically be&#13;
handled as efficiently as linear relationships, without explicit&#13;
recognition that the relationships are non-linear. This is in&#13;
marked contrast with regression technique, which requires&#13;
determination of the precise functional form in advance. In&#13;
those instances where the functional form is well known and the&#13;
1/ I am indebted to Michael Hartley for clarifying my thoughts on this&#13;
issue though he should not be implicated with my interpretation of&#13;
the U.S. census method used here to impute incomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121 -&#13;
data are scattered so that matching is difficult, repression&#13;
analysis may provide more valid imputations, but with large&#13;
bodies of data where similar cases do exist, imputation by&#13;
matching has the virtues of retaining the distributional&#13;
characteristics of the original sample and reflecting the&#13;
basic relationship more accurately."&#13;
In this case we are merely using two subsets from the same data&#13;
set with the assumption that the "main" data set has many individuals with&#13;
characteristics similar to those in the smaller "no information" data sub-set.&#13;
One further characteristic of this data set, common to most census or house-&#13;
hold survey samples, was utilized. Data are usually arranged in spatial&#13;
order: i.e. households living in sample segment 1 are followed by the next&#13;
sample segment 2, then segment 3. ....... etc.   Hence the method of imputing&#13;
the income of the last entry cell in the matrix also has the property that&#13;
that individual is likely to be living in a similar area of the city.&#13;
The result of these imputations is that all individuals who work&#13;
now have incomes except the non-remunerated family workers who have zero&#13;
incomes.&#13;
5. Household Income: Household income was aggregated from its&#13;
constituents' labor and non-labor incomes but care was taken to exclude&#13;
live-in domestic servants' incomes from the aggregation.&#13;

APPENDIX 2&#13;
THE COVERAGE OF INCOME IN BOGOTA IN THE&#13;
1973 POPULATION CENSUS AND 1977 HOUSEHOLD SURVEY&#13;
There is considerable skepticism concerning the coverage of&#13;
income in the population census and household surveys. The population&#13;
census asked only one question: "How much did you earn last month?", and&#13;
hence one can expect that non-labor income, transfers, etc. would tend to&#13;
be understated. Household surveys have more detailed questions: they&#13;
ask for the periodicity of wages received, the wages, wages in kind and&#13;
non-labor income specifically. Thus one expects that they would capture&#13;
a larger proportion of income than the population census. Since estimates&#13;
of poverty are often based on these sources it is of some importance to&#13;
obtain an idea of the extent of understatement of income in these sources.&#13;
What proportion of personal income can we expect surveys and census to&#13;
cover? In the-U.S. T. Paul Schultz (1964) estimated that the 1950 and 1960&#13;
census covered 91 and 94 percent respectively of total income (as reported&#13;
by OBE - the Office of Business Economics). The Current Population Surveys&#13;
(CPS), on the other hand, covered about 85 percent of total income. All of&#13;
these sources succeeded in capturing about 95 percent of labor income - 99&#13;
percent in the case of the 1960 census. The error arose from non-labor&#13;
income whose coverage ranged from 40 to 60 percent. Thus what can be&#13;
expected of Colombian surveys if they matched U.S. surveys? For Colombia&#13;
as a whole, approximately 40 percent of total income is labor income and&#13;
60 percent non-labor income. Hence if we assume a) that the proportions&#13;
are similar for Bogota, b) that Colombian surveys also cover about 50 percent&#13;
of non-labor income and 90 percent of labor income expected coverage would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
be&#13;
(0.4 x 0.9) + (0.6 x 0.5) = 0.66.&#13;
i.e. 66 percent. This provides us with an approximate yardstick with&#13;
which to assess the coverage of Colombian surveys.&#13;
The next problem is to define the appropriate concept of total&#13;
personal income from national income accounts with which income as&#13;
obtained from surveys can be compared. This note provides one approach&#13;
for doing this.&#13;
The recently published Cuentas Regionales (Colombia, 1977)&#13;
provide the first good estimates of gross regional product for Bogota.&#13;
For purposes of comparison with income data obtained in a household survey&#13;
the gross regional product (G.R.P.) needs to be whittled down to Total&#13;
Personal Income. This is performed in Table A.a. for the years 1970 and&#13;
1975 as an illustration since these are the most recent years available.&#13;
Note that imputed housing income for owner occupied dwellings and&#13;
employers' contributions to social security and other funds are subtracted&#13;
from the standard concept of total personal income for purposes of&#13;
comparability with household surveys and censuses.&#13;
In the absence of such detailed accounts data for 1973 and 1977&#13;
I approximate personal income for Bogota as 65 percent of gross domestic&#13;
(regional) product at market prices in those years.&#13;

The Bogota regional product is not available for 1977. But we&#13;
have the following data for Bogota GRP as a proportion of Colombia:&#13;
1960                   15.4  percent&#13;
1965                   17.6' percent&#13;
1970                   19.9  percent&#13;
1973                   20.9  percent&#13;
1974                   21.2  percent&#13;
1975                   21.4  percent&#13;
Hence assume         1977                  22.0  percent&#13;

APPENDIX 3&#13;
THE POPULATION OF BOGOTA AND&#13;
ITS SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION WITHIN THE CITY&#13;
As mentioned in the text of the paper (Section III), various&#13;
doubts have been expressed about the coverage of the population census of&#13;
1973 in Bogota. One possible cause of under-enumeration of the population&#13;
census was a teachers' strike which took place in Bogota at the time and&#13;
many of the teachers had been employed as the enumerators. The 1972 Urban&#13;
Development Study Phase II Study and Household Survey was based on a&#13;
sample frame taken at the time which included dwelling unit counts in the&#13;
city. Based on these counts the Phase II estimates of the population of&#13;
Bogota was 2.85 million in 1972. The manual count of the Bogota census&#13;
yielded a population of 2.499 million. Since we are also very concerned&#13;
with within city distributions we compared the within city distribution&#13;
from both sources to arrive at a final estimate of the population of Bogota&#13;
in 1973 for the purposes of the City Study.&#13;
Appendix Table A.b. reports the counts of dwelling units, house-&#13;
holds and estimates of population for the 1964 census, 1972 Phase II Study&#13;
1/&#13;
and the-1973 Census by comuna-. To obtain the final estimate, in general,&#13;
we took the larger estimate from the Census and Phase II on the principle&#13;
that dwelling units can be under-counted but not over-counted. We made&#13;
two exceptions to this rule where the higher estimate seemed far too high&#13;
for a reasonable population density for the area. The resulting total&#13;
population for Bogota for 1973 is 2,877,253 which is the number used&#13;
throughout this paper.&#13;

Having decided on the "true" population distribution for Bogota&#13;
disaggregated by comuna we are now in a position to expand the public use&#13;
tape to accurately represent the city spatially. The number of households&#13;
within each comuna presented in the tape were expanded to give the final&#13;
count of households by comuna. If we assume that&#13;
a) The sample households are accurately representative of the&#13;
true household size in the comuna&#13;
b) The participation rate of the labor force in the sample is&#13;
also truly representative of the participation rate in the&#13;
comuna&#13;
Then, this expansion yields the true population as well as the true labor&#13;
force in the comuna. Appendix Table A.c gives the household counts from&#13;
the final estimate for Bogota and from the sample tape by comuna and the&#13;
implied expansion factors resulting which were used for this study.&#13;

            The people of Bogota : who they are, what
            they earn, where they live
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper describes the characteristics
            of the population of Bogota: who are the people, what are
            their characteristics, what they do and where do they live
            on the basis of a detailed examination of several primary
            data sources. It also places the development of Bogota in a
            historical and national context in order to provide a better
            understanding of currently existing patterns. Bogota has
            gone through a phase of extremely rapid urbanization over
            the past half century during which it has grown more than
            ten fold. The data on fertility rates, trends in the
            participation of women in the labor force and indications of
            a recent slow down in the rate of growth of Bogota suggest
            that the next decade will see Bogota growing much more
            slowly. The demographic structure of the city is much like
            that of other Latin American cities: it has a high
            proportion of women, as well as children under 15 years of
            age, the latter comprising more than 40% of the population.
            Thus, the labor force of Bogota can be expected to continue
            to expand at high rates even after the population growth
            slows down. The city has a balanced economic structure which
            is not dominated by manufacturing, nor services nor
            administration, as it is in some other large cities of the world.
