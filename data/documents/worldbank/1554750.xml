Abstract&#13;
In 1976 Argentine policymakers launched a major program to remove&#13;
controls on prices, interest rates, and international transactions.&#13;
Simultaneously, they attempted to rid the economy of inflation. By 1981 these&#13;
reforms had been abandoned, and the economy had returned to hyperinflation.&#13;
This paper documents the reactions of firms to the major changes in the&#13;
environment between 1976 and 1981, and provides new evidence on why the&#13;
reforms failed.&#13;
The analysis is based upon the financial statements of 155 publicly&#13;
traded industrial corporations. These statements are corrected for inflation&#13;
and used to construct a time series of financial performance indicators for&#13;
each firm. Values of these indicators are then compared over time for three&#13;
major firm types: exportable goods producers, importable goods producers, and&#13;
nontradeable goods producers.&#13;
Perhaps the most fundamental lesson from the analysis is that&#13;
extremely large subsidies were provided to the Argentine industrial sector by&#13;
way of negative effective financial costs, These negative costs appeared&#13;
first in the late 1970s because of the real peso appreciation, then again in&#13;
1981 because of the exchange insurance program.  The amount of these subsidies&#13;
for any firm was inversely related to its stock of monetary assets and&#13;
directly related to its debt and to its exposure in foreign currency. So the&#13;
relatively risky financial structures that emerged as the reform period&#13;
progressed are probably partly traceable to the incentives created by these&#13;
relationships. Unsurprisingly, large firms appear to have been the most&#13;
heavily indebted in foreign currency.&#13;
During the late 1970s firms substituted dollar debt for peso debt,&#13;
keeping their overall leverage stable. But beginning in 1980, when earnings&#13;
rates fell sharply, they steadily increased their reliance on debt finance.&#13;
So increases in firms' financial riskiness may by this time have been partly&#13;
due to distress borrowing. The earnings shortfall was caused by the temporary&#13;
appearance of positive real peso interest rates and the disappearance of&#13;
lucrative currency arbitrage possibilities. For tradeable goods producers&#13;
this shortfall was made worse by major reductions in price-cost margins --&#13;
probably reflecting the government's policy of forcing down inflation by&#13;
systematically slowing the devaluation rate.&#13;
Average earnings rates (after correcting for inflation) were restored&#13;
by the exchange insurance program in 1981, but the financial environment was&#13;
by then much more volatile than during the late 1970s. Not only were&#13;
leverages higher and liquidity levels much lower, but gross operating earnings&#13;
were reduced and highly variable across firms. Both importable and&#13;
nontradeable goods producers suffered a major reduction in capacity&#13;
utilization, and although price-cost margins improved for tradeables with&#13;
several maxi-devaluations, bankruptcies multiplied.&#13;
The industrial sector did not rid itself of dollar debt as the 1981&#13;
devaluations became certain. Given that the exchange insurance program was&#13;
immediately instituted, this proved to have been a shrewd policy. But it also&#13;
contributed to the severe balance of payments crisis from which the Argentine&#13;
government has yet to escape.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Extracto&#13;
En 1976 los rectores de la politica de Argentina lanzaron un&#13;
importante programa tendiente a eliminar el control de los precios, de los&#13;
tipos de interes y de las transacciones internacionales. Simultaneamente&#13;
intentaron liberar a la economia de la inflaci6n. En 1981 estas reformas&#13;
habian sido abandonadas y la economia habia vuelto a la hiperinflaci6n.&#13;
En este estudio se documenta la reacci6n de las firmas ante los grandes&#13;
cambios que se produjeron en el medio que las rodeaba entre 1976 y 1981 y&#13;
se presentan razones nuevas por las cuales las reformas fracasaron.&#13;
El analisis se basa en los estados financieros de 155 sociedades&#13;
an6nimas industriales cuyas acciones se cotizan pukblicamente. Estos&#13;
estados, corregidos para tener en cuenta la inflaci6n, se usaron para&#13;
construir una serie cronol6gica de indicadores de comportamiento&#13;
financiero para cada firma. Luego se compararon en distintos periodos los&#13;
valores de estos indicadores correspondientes a tres importantes tipos de&#13;
firmas: productoras de bienes exportables, productoras de bienes&#13;
importables y productoras de bienes no exportables.&#13;
Quizas la lecci6n mas fundamental del analisis sean los enormes&#13;
subsidios otorgados al sector industrial de la Argentina por medio de&#13;
costos financieros 'efectivos negativos. Estos costos aparecieron por&#13;
primera vez en los ultimos ainos de la decada de 1970 debido a la&#13;
apreciaci6n real del peso y nuevamente en 1981 debido al programa de&#13;
seguro cambiario. El monto de estos subsidios guardaba una relaci6n&#13;
inversa al stock de activos monetarios de las firmas y una relaci6n&#13;
directa con su deuda y compromisos netos en divisas. De modo que las&#13;
estructuras financieras relativamente arriesgadas que surgieron a medida&#13;
que avanzaba el periodo de reforma probablemente se deban en parte a los&#13;
incentivos creados por estas relaciones. No es de sorprender el hecho de&#13;
que las firmas grandes parezcan ser las que mas endeudadas estaban en&#13;
divisas.&#13;
Durante los ultimos anios de la decada de 1970 las firmas&#13;
remplazaron sus deudas en pesos por deudas en d6lares, manteniendo estable&#13;
su relaci6n global deuda/capital propio. Sin embargo, en 1980, cuando sus&#13;
ingresos disminuyeron en forma acentuada, empezaron a recurrir&#13;
sostenidamente y cada vez en mayor grado al financiamiento mediante deuda,&#13;
de modo que es posible que en esa epoca el aumento de los riesgos&#13;
financieros se haya debido en parte al endeudamiento forzoso. La&#13;
insuficiencia temporal de ingresos tuvo su origen en la aparici6n de los&#13;
tipos de interes reales positivos sobre los prestamos en pesos y la&#13;
desaparici6n de las posibilidades de efectuar un arbitraje lucrativo de&#13;
monedas. En el caso de los productores de bienes exportables esta escasez&#13;
se agrav6 a causa de grandes reducciones de los mArgenes precio-costo,&#13;
probablemente como resultado de la politica del Gobierno de contener la&#13;
inflaci6n frenando sistematicamente la tasa de devaluaci6n.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Los ingresos medios (despues de corregido el efecto de la&#13;
inflaci6n) fueron restablecidos por el programa de seguro cambiario, en&#13;
1981, pero para entonces el clima financiero era mucho mAs inestable que&#13;
en los ultimos anios de la d6cada anterior. No s6lo el nivel de&#13;
endeudamiento era mAs alto y el de liquidez mucho mas bajo, sino que los&#13;
ingresos de operaci6n brutos habian disminuido y variaban&#13;
considerablemente de una firma a otra. Tanto los productores de bienes&#13;
importables como los productores de bienes no exportables sufrieron una&#13;
gran reducci6n de su capacidad utilizada y, pese a que los mArgenes&#13;
precio-costo de los productos exportables mejoraron gracias a varias&#13;
importantes devaluaciones, las quiebras se multiplicaron.&#13;
El sector industrial no se liber6 de la deuda en d6lares cuando&#13;
las devaluaciones de 1981 pasaron a ser una certeza. Dado que el programa&#13;
de seguro cambiario se instituy6 inmediatamente, esto result6 ser una&#13;
medida astuta, pero tambien contribuy6 a la grave crisis de balanza de&#13;
pagos de la cual el Gobierno de Argentina todavia no ha salido.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Condense&#13;
En 1976, les dirigeants argentins ont lanc6 un vaste programme&#13;
de liberalisation du regime des prix, des taux d'interet et du commerce&#13;
exterieur. En meme temps, ils entreprenaient de delivrer 1'economie&#13;
nationale de l'inflation. Des 1981, ces reformes avaient et6 abandonnees&#13;
et l'inflation etait redevenue galopante. Le pre'sent document expose&#13;
comment les entreprises ont r6agi aux principales modifications de leur&#13;
environnement entre 1976 et 1981 et donne un nouvel apercu des raisons&#13;
pour lesquelles cette tentative a echoue.&#13;
Ses conclusions sont fondees sur les etats financiers de&#13;
155 societes industrielles dont les actions sont cotees en bourse. Apres&#13;
avoir corrig6 les chiffres pour tenir compte de l'inflation, on en a tire&#13;
une serie chronologique d'indicateurs de la performance financiere de&#13;
chaque entreprise. On a alors compare l'volution dans le temps de ces&#13;
indicateurs pour trois principaux types de producteurs : les producteurs&#13;
de biens exportables, les producteurs de biens importables et les&#13;
producteurs de biens ne faisant pas l'objet d'echanges internationaux.&#13;
Le fait le plus fondamental qui se d6gage de 1'etude est&#13;
peut-etre que le secteur industriel argentin a beneficie de subventions&#13;
extremement importantes sous forme de couats financiers r6els n6gatifs.&#13;
Ces coats ont commence d'etre negatifs vers la fin des ann6es 70 a cause&#13;
de la valorisation reelle du peso et ont recommenc6 a l'etre en 1981 avec&#13;
l'instauration du programme d'assurance des risques de change. Le montant&#13;
de ces subventions a et6, pour chaque entreprise, inversement&#13;
proportionnel a ses ressources monetaires propres et directement lie au&#13;
volume de sa dette et a celui de ses emprunts en devises. L'apparition de&#13;
structures financieres relativement vulnerables a mesure que la periode de&#13;
reforme se prolongeait est donc probablement imputable en partie aux&#13;
avantages qui pouvaient etre tires de ces rapports entre elements du&#13;
bilan. Les grosses soci6tes semblent, ce qui n'est guere surprenant, etre&#13;
celles qui se sont le plus lourdement endettees en devises.&#13;
Vers la fin des annees 70, les entreprises ont remplace leur&#13;
dette en pesos par une dette en dollars, tout en conservant un ratio&#13;
d'endettement stable. A partir de 1980, leurs gains ayant&#13;
considerablement diminue, elles n'ont cesse de recourir de plus en plus a&#13;
l'emprunt pour leur financement. I1 est donc possible qu'a cette epoque,&#13;
l'accroissement des risques financiers pris par les entreprises ait 6te du&#13;
en partie a la necessite pour elle d'emprunter pour survivre. La&#13;
diminution des gains a ete provoquee par l'apparition de taux d'interet&#13;
reels positifs sur les emprunts en pesos et la disparition de possibilites&#13;
d'arbitrage lucratif entre monnaies. Pour les producteurs de biens&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
exportables, cette diminution a ete aggrav6e par d'importantes reductions&#13;
de la marge entre les prix et les coats - probablement dues a la politique&#13;
du Gouvernement visant a juguler l'inflation en ralentissant&#13;
systematiquement le rythme des devaluations.&#13;
Les taux moyens de gains (apres correction pour tenir compte de&#13;
l'inflation) se sont retablis grace au programme d'assurance des risques&#13;
de change en 1981, mais le climat financier etait devenu des lors beaucoup&#13;
plus instable qu'a la fin des annees 70. Les ratios d'endettement etaient&#13;
plus 61eves et les coefficients de liquidite beaucoup plus bas, et, en&#13;
outre, les recettes d'exploitation brutes avaient diminue et variaient&#13;
fortement. Les producteurs de biens importables et de biens ne faisant&#13;
pas l'objet d'6changes internationaux ont enregistre une importante&#13;
r6duction du taux d'utilisation de leur capacite et, bien que les marges&#13;
entre les prix et les coats se soient amelior6es dans le cas des biens&#13;
exportables a la suite de grosses devaluations, les faillites se sont&#13;
multipliees.&#13;
Le secteur industriel ne s'est pas debarrasse de sa dette en&#13;
dollars lorsqu'il est devenu evident en 1981 que les devaluations allaient&#13;
se succ6der. Le programme d'assurance des risques de change ayant et6&#13;
imm6diatement institu6, cette politique s'est revel6e payante. Mais, en&#13;
meme temps, elle a contribu6 a la grave crise de balance des paiements&#13;
devant laquelle le Gouvernement argentin continue de se trouver.&#13;

I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
Upon taking office in 1976, a new team of Argentine policymakers set&#13;
out to dismantle government controls on prices, interest rates, international&#13;
trade, and capital flows. Liberalization proceeded rapidly for interest rates&#13;
and capital flows, but the persistence of hyperinflation frustrated the team's&#13;
attempt to create an efficient free-market economy. So, after contractionary&#13;
monetary policies and temporarily reimposed wage and price controls proved&#13;
unsuccessful, the policymakers decided in 1978 to retard the pace of currency&#13;
devaluation according to a preannounced schedule. It was hoped that this new&#13;
exchange rate regime, called the "tablita," would break inflationary&#13;
expectations and, by pulling down domestic interest rates, maintain aggregate&#13;
demand.&#13;
The combined effects of these liberalization and stabilization&#13;
policies did not coincide with intentions. Rather than force inflation down&#13;
for all sectors, the tablita caused the ratio of tradable to nontradeable good&#13;
prices to fall by two-thirds between 1977 and 1981. Moreover, despite the&#13;
removal of most restrictions on international capital movements, the real cost&#13;
of peso borrowing typically exceeded that of dollar borrowing by 40 percent to&#13;
100 percent a year. Nor was inflation ever conquered. Instead, foreign&#13;
currency reserves at the Central Bank became so depleted that by 1981 major&#13;
devaluations were inevitable. These devaluations effectively ended the&#13;
attempt at liberalization -- and ushered in interest controls, subsidized&#13;
foreign exchange insurance for firms with dollar indebtedness, and other&#13;
capital market interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Several macro models have recently been developed to egair.n what&#13;
transpired in Argentina.   From theseD, much bas been leaTned, bzz c*0 one has&#13;
yet explained how the various financial and "re.l. side" shocks sccbned to&#13;
generate observed patterns of behavio0.c.  This lack of a full F           can&#13;
be partly traced to the paucity of fi    level evidence on the cc-:eio ences of&#13;
each major change in the economic environment. Foc example, befc;ze industrial&#13;
sector behavior can be reasonably representedc, it must be estab":shed whether&#13;
each major change in the real exchange rate was devastatnLg because of its&#13;
effect on relative prices, because of its effect on aggregate de-and, or&#13;
because of its effect on financial obligations --- or lhether lt vas devastac'&#13;
ting at all.  Similarly, the link between fluctuations in imterTst rates and&#13;
the behavior of firms cannot be modeled ^yithnouti some idea ol the effect of&#13;
changes in peso and dollar interest rates on corporate profits0    Thiis paper&#13;
provides evidence on such basic empirical issues by analyz-ing cc.cporate income&#13;
statements and balance sheets for MS7/6-861&#13;
B. Sources of Economic Shocks&#13;

exchange rate to 53. The burden of adjustment to this prolonged   -&#13;
was apparently borne by exporters and ;nwport competlng fiLrmo  lLe, inaseuch&#13;
as the ratio of exportable to importable goods prices exhibits nuch leas&#13;
fluctuation. 17onethelessD it has becc-e popular to obseeTve that 'Importable&#13;

because tariffs and quantitative import restrictions Mere So higIh that they&#13;
provided redundant protection (Fernandez 1983; Woguees 2983, Wogart and .&#13;
1984).&#13;
Fluctuations of inflation and interest rates were as &amp;ormatic as&#13;
movements in the exchange rate. F'rom the beginning of R976 thioTgh 7.377OEEl&#13;
pesc-denominated interest rates remained well belcW the rate of eInflation0&#13;
These interest rates exhibited a clear rising trend over thmis peziod, and&#13;
inflation tended to fall0 I/ But it was not until interest controls wsEe&#13;
removed in 1977.I11 that real rates on peso credit became posltva.&#13;
Thereafter restrictions on capital inflows w-yere loosencdc and peso rates&#13;
subsided more rapidly than inflation, By Dacember 1978 neew execagne rEte&#13;
policies ensured that international interest a         wouid pull rescl rates&#13;

period for tradeables, given that the real exchange rate index simultaneously&#13;
fell 34 percent (from 50 to 33). As with the real exchange rate, the&#13;
devaluation of 1981 II and simultaneous burst of inflation (between 200&#13;
percent and 300 percent) finally broke this pattern.&#13;
The fluctuation of real borrowing costs in pesos relative to those in&#13;
dollars further complicated the financial policies of firms during the&#13;
Argentine experiment. Generally, during the sustained real appreciation of&#13;
the peso, the costs of borrowing in dollars were much lower than those for&#13;
peso credit. But uncertainty over exchange rate policy periodically widened&#13;
the spread between foreign currency and domestic credit costs.   Before 1981&#13;
this gap was largest around mid-1978, reached a local minimum in early 1979&#13;
(about 33 percent annualized), and thereafter fluctuated erratically with a&#13;
rising trend. After 1980, the major devaluations in 1981.II and 1981.IV would&#13;
have created extremely high costs for borrowers with significant dollar debt&#13;
-- but for the government insurance programs that allowed debtors to retire&#13;
obligations at extremely favorable rates. These programs pushed the effective&#13;
real cost of dollars to new lows and provided a potentially important revenue&#13;
source to the industrial sector (refer to Appendix 3).&#13;
Labor costs also changed markedly with wages falling steadily in&#13;
relation to prices, from 123 in 1976 to 92 in 1978.IV. Then, this ratio rose&#13;
just as steadily to 128 in 1981.IV. 1/ Because employers were subject to wage&#13;
controls until the end of 1977, they used indirect payment schemes to&#13;
compensate their workers. The figures should not be taken too literally, but&#13;
they do provide a crude index of tightness in the labor market.&#13;
1/ There was some leveling off during 1981, probably because of the&#13;
recession. Measured unemployment clearly increased in that year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Finally, real industrial output fluctuated considerably over the&#13;
reform period presumably in response to demand conditions. From 7.377 through&#13;
1980, the industrial sector was operating at fairly stable capacity&#13;
utilization rates, although there was a dip in 1i9780  mhen, production fell&#13;
sharply in 1981 with the disintegration of the reform program.&#13;
C. Open Issues Regarding Licro Financial rnenomena&#13;
Inflation, demand conditions, interest rates1, exCchange gates, wyages,&#13;
and regulatory regimes all combined to influence the income streauis of&#13;
firms0  In turn, these income streams combined with expectations -bout the&#13;
future economic environment to determine the financial structures and&#13;
investment policies of firmso  These financial structures and investment&#13;
policies then determined how future changes in thn economic environment wZould&#13;
affect future income.&#13;
These micro financial links, though recognized as critical ir&#13;
Argentine experiment, have yet to be systematically analyzed0  T^s gap in our&#13;
understanding of the effects of liberalization and stabilization -s'a largely&#13;
attributable to the tendency of researchers to rely on readily observable&#13;
macro and sectoral data. Such data describe inflation, relative Y;rices,&#13;
production levels, and the rate of return on various financial medi&gt;7a0  But&#13;
they do not indicate (1) the combined effect of these variables cc corporate&#13;
income, (2) the relative importance of each variable, or (3) the casociated&#13;
changes in the financial structures of firms0&#13;
This study tries to uncover new evidence on each of thes2 basic&#13;
issues. Each issue is addressed in turn, and the findings are Telated to what&#13;
has been commonly believed. At this point, therefore, it is convenient to&#13;
review these popular conjectures. To begin, for the patterns of corpcrate&#13;
income, it is often maintained thatg&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
Conjecture 1: The income of tradable goods producers fell relative to that of&#13;
nontradeable goods producers until 1981.&#13;
Conjecture 2: The income of importable goods producers did not begin to fall&#13;
until that of exportable goods producers had begun to decline.&#13;
Conjecture 3: During 1979-82, the latter stage of the Argentine experiment,&#13;
income accrued to corporations at a much slower pace than during 1977-&#13;
1979.&#13;
Conjectures that identify the determinants of these income patterns&#13;
can also be found in the literature:&#13;
Conjecture 4: Real appreciation of the peso forced tradable goods producers&#13;
to reduce their price/cost margins relative to nontradeable goods&#13;
producers.&#13;
Conjecture 5: Tariff protection was high enough for import-competing firms&#13;
that real appreciation initially did not force them to reduce their profit&#13;
margins.&#13;
Conjecture 6: Until 1981 capacity utilization was kept high by fiscal&#13;
deficits, particularly by public expenditure in the nontradeable goods&#13;
sector.&#13;
Conjecture 7: Real interest rate increases caused the industrial sector's&#13;
downfall during 1980 and 1981.&#13;
Finally, with respect to the changes in corporate financial structure&#13;
during the Argentine experiment, many have speculated that:&#13;
Conjecture 8: Firms were often caught in a vicious cycle of falling earnings&#13;
and rising debt obligations that forced distress borrowing, liquidity&#13;
crises, and sometimes bankruptcy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Conjecture 9:  Firms in some cases were inspfred by arbitrage posG.bili1ties in&#13;
financial markets to shift their attention fz-c productive act.vitLes.&#13;
Conjecture 1O0 In anticipation of the 1981 devaluations, and witk% no exchangs&#13;
insurance yet in place, firms with dollar indebtedness suitchod to pesos&#13;
as quickly as possible.&#13;
110  METHOD FOR TRACKING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
We start by sorting 153 industrial firms into three grousSÂ°&#13;
importable goods producers, exportable goods producers, and nontradeable goods&#13;
producers. We then compare financial statements across groups are time. Thais&#13;
comparison is organized in three stages that correspond to the tchee basic&#13;
issues identified above. In the first stage, patterns of industr^al earnings&#13;
are examined. In the second stage, fluctuations f.n income are decomposed into&#13;
the influences of interest rates, exchange rates, inflation, capecity&#13;
utilization rates, and relative prices. In Â¢-he thirfd stage, the cufulative&#13;
impact of income fluctuation and various market signals on corporate financial&#13;
structures is examined0  Tihe financial statist-i&amp;cs used in each    T are now&#13;
discussed; then econometric procedures for comparing these statir-,tics across&#13;
sectors and time are reviewed0&#13;
A0  Stage 1:  Documenting income&#13;
Net income is perhaps the single most iZmportEnt indicatcT of&#13;
corporate performance, but little attention has been paid directly to it. The&#13;
first stage of the analysis fills this gap by conotructing and analyz':ng&#13;
several income measures, each differing in its zreatment of infl2tion-induced&#13;
gains or losses0  A review of the logic beh.nd ou.r inflati-on ad-^.  -   is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
provided in a separate paper (Tybout 1984); here these measures are very&#13;
briefly reviewed.&#13;
What is known about the corporate sector's income during the reform&#13;
period is essentially based upon reported income figures. 1/ These figures&#13;
roughly represent realized cash flow after nominal financial costs, but before&#13;
the acquisition or retirement of monetary items. 2/ Put differently, these&#13;
figures roughly represent the income that would have accrued to the firm if it&#13;
had not sustained inflation-induced gains or losses on monetary items. We&#13;
begin our analysis with this income concept because it probably inspired some&#13;
of the conjectures listed above, and hence serves as a convenient reference&#13;
point. When expressed as a rate of return on average net worth, it will be&#13;

During periods of inflation, monetary assets and liabilities tend to&#13;
shrink over time, and the interest rate on such items includes a premium to&#13;
compensate for this shrinkage. So, recognizing total financial costs without&#13;
simultaneously recognizing reductions in the value of monetary items yields a&#13;
misleading measure of income (e.g. , Cagan and Lipsey 1979). By adding the net&#13;
gain from this shrinkage to firms' reported income, a "corrected" measure may&#13;
be constructed. In Argentina, this corrected measure roughly corresponds to&#13;
the real income concept that results from the use of "general purchasing&#13;
power" accounting techniques, which in turn can be shown to approximate real&#13;

governed the preparation of financial statements in our sample.&#13;
2/ Financial costs include interest payments and net devaluation-induced&#13;
losses on most foreign currency items. Monetary items are assets and&#13;
liabilities whose value is fixed by contract or statute in terms of the&#13;
domestic currency (e.g., Scapens 1981). Most important, these include&#13;
deposits at intermediaries, net trade credit, and nonindexed debt.&#13;

B. Stage 2:   Linking Income Fluctuation with the Economic&#13;
Environment&#13;
Major shocks to the economic environment during the ArgentLne reforms&#13;
affected firms' earnings through a variety of channels, often&#13;
simultaneously0  If links between these shocks and frmE'level financial&#13;
consequences are to be disentangled, the income fluctuations must be&#13;
decomposed into the various contributiona of each channel of transmn.ssion0&#13;
This is done in the second stage of the analysiso&#13;
The financial statement disaggregation used in this atudy is&#13;
presented in tables 2A and 2Bo  As meneioned earlier, reported inccrn (G i) io&#13;

inflation losses on monetary items (G12), is our corrected earnings measure&#13;
(G13). To decompose fluctuation in these earnings measures, each is expressed&#13;
as rate of return on net worth and restated as a function of standard&#13;
financial ratios. These financial ratios, which measure the magnitude of one&#13;
income statement or balance sheet item relative to another, are then used to&#13;
isolate particular varieties of shocks to the income stream. For uncorrected&#13;
earnings rates, we choose the following expression: 1/&#13;
(1) r = G11/W = [(G3/G1)    (G4/G1)    (G1/A)&#13;
gross unit overhead asset&#13;
margins     costs    turnover&#13;
+ {[(G3IG1) - (G4/GI)](G1/A) - (G5/D)}{(D/A)/[1 - (D/A)I}&#13;
average gearing&#13;
financial cost&#13;
Similarly, given that the adjusted earnings rate is estimated with the ratio&#13;
(G11-G12)IW, we use the same decomposition for - c after replacing average&#13;
financial costs, G5/D, with average real financial costs, (G5+G12)/D:&#13;
(2)       c(11 =12G-G       = [(G3/G1) - (G4/G )](G /A)&#13;
+ {[(G3IG1     (G4/G1)](G1/A) - (G5 + G12)/D} {(D/A)/[D/A]}&#13;
1/ Taxes and extraordinary earnings are ignored here. All variables are&#13;
defined in Table 2. The calculation of earnings rates and several other&#13;
ratios is actually more involved than depicted here because of problems&#13;
with stock-flow comparisons. Procedures used for calculation are&#13;
described in appendix 2.&#13;

We now briefly discuss how these ratios can be interpreted as&#13;
indicators of the importance of various economic disturbances to firms.&#13;
1. Gross Margins G3/G1 1/&#13;
Changes in the ratio of gross earnings to sales ("gross margins")&#13;
reflect changes in the relative prices of inputs and outputs, and hence are&#13;
one basic indicator of the extent to which real exchange rate movements, wage&#13;
controls, and commercial policy affect corporate profitability. Naturally, it&#13;
is unrealistic to expect to establish conclusively the importance of each&#13;
shock in terms of its impact on gross margins. But, margin changes can be&#13;
examined for consistency with various hypotheses regarding the importance of&#13;
relative price changes in shaping patterns of corporate profitability.&#13;
2. Overhead: G4/Gl&#13;
From equations 1 and 2 it is apparent that overhead costs (basically&#13;
administrative and marketing expenses) per unit sale are a second source of&#13;
earnings fluctuation. Like gross margins, there are several possible&#13;
interpretations of this variable. First, because the numerator of this ratio&#13;
tends to remain relatively stable in the face of sales fluctuations, it often&#13;
reflects capacity utilization. Second, because some firms can adjust&#13;
executive salaries and marketing outlays as the economic environment changes,&#13;
the ratio can also reflect flexibility and responsiveness to market signals.&#13;
3. Asset Turnover: G1/A&#13;
Another indicator of capacity utilization, perhaps better, is "asset&#13;
turnover," or the ratio of sales to total assets. At any given book value of&#13;
assets and set of output prices, the asset turnover ratio will move in direct&#13;
1/ Possible biases in this and all other ratio variables are explained in&#13;
Tybout (1984). These biases are mentioned when relevant to this paper's&#13;
discussion of results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
proportion to the physical volume of saleso Accordingly, a compariSon of&#13;
groSs EnarCin and asset turnover behavior can indicate whether changes in gross&#13;
profits have reflected associated relative price shifts changees in capacity&#13;
utili2etion, or both.&#13;
40  Average Financial Costs:   G5/D and (G5+G 12)/D&#13;
Uhlaeo a firm is self-financed, its net earnings flow are influenced&#13;
by interest Eate fluctuations. But these shocks are unlikely to be uniformly&#13;
distributed acrooS firms for several reasons. First, as is apparent in&#13;
equations I and 2, the importance of interest shocks is directly proportional&#13;
to the leverge of the corporation (as meas-ured by D/A)r   firms that rely&#13;
prim&amp;zily on selfÂ£finance are relatively immune to slhocks0 Second, if some&#13;
firms engage more heavily in foreign borrowing than others, they will ueather&#13;
distinc    t      fluctuations in credit costs0&#13;
3hen the earnings rate r is being constructed, it is asetned that all&#13;
nominal interast costs represent a drain on the earnings stream, and none are&#13;
fin7ce,d with new borrowingo   So the ratio G5/DD total financial coots over&#13;
toZnI d&amp;btD is an approximation of nominal interest rates0    Alternatively,&#13;
when the earnings rate r is being constructed, it is assumed that nominal&#13;
interest obligations are partly defrayed by expansion of the nominal debt&#13;
stock at a rate which keeps the real stock constanto   Hence, the ratio&#13;
(G5+$R2)fD  .-:e-: '^-' :c real interest ratcs0  Zoth Pueasures will be enamined.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
1l Liquidity Crises&#13;
A liquidity crisis occurs when the debt obligations of the corpora-&#13;
tion cannot easily be met by drawing down cash reserves and liquidating short-&#13;
term assets. Such a situation typically followes a sustained peAio6 of loef&#13;
real earnings rates in which liquid assets are contivually dratrn dot-n to meet&#13;
payroll, interest, and other routine costs. Firmi that zely iehavi-y on&#13;
foreign credit may also experience liquidity crises quite s-addenly if the&#13;
exchange rate moves adversely. So long as the total value of a fi.ins assets&#13;
substantially exceeds its total debt obligationsv, a liquidity crisis need not&#13;
threaten its existence. Such crises can, however, foTce creditors to `z0oll&#13;
over" short-term debt -- and to require in return that firms take certain&#13;
measures that they might not otherwise have choseno&#13;
The first statistic used to detect lIquidity problems is t   " urrent&#13;
ratio," the ratio of all short term assets to all short-tema liabil.1ztLes&#13;
(refer to table 3). When this ratio falls below eI, thne corporaticr is in&#13;
danger of a liquidity crisis because the liquidation of all assets that can be&#13;
readily converted to cash will not cover all currxent liabilities. Cenerally,&#13;
the more conservative the firm, the more liquid the balance sheet structure&#13;
and the longer it will be able to weather adverse earnings or revaluation&#13;
shocks before encountering such a crIsIso&#13;
The current ratio includes inventorIes i.n its numerator, which f or&#13;
many corporationo may not be easy to  al6,:z on short notices     Sz, during&#13;
periods of slack demand, the current ratio can be misleading0 Zr.ventozies mey&#13;

also be examined. Since the quick ratio is expressed entirely in terms of&#13;
items whose recorded values are very near their current values, this ratio is&#13;
among the least subject to inflation bias.&#13;
2. Solvency Problems&#13;
A crisis of solvency occurs when the value of assets falls to within&#13;
a narrow margin of total debt obligations. Like liquidity crises, the crises&#13;
of solvency often occur after a prolonged period of negative real earnings&#13;
rates. But these can also be suddenly brought on by adverse revaluation&#13;
effects. When a firm's assets no longer exceed its debts, it is technically&#13;
insolvent and becomes the property of its creditors. Its assets are sold and&#13;
the proceeds are divided among creditors in accord with the provisions of the&#13;
contracts they held. But, in some countries, Argentina among them, such&#13;
dissolution is often initially forgone in favor of a formal agreement between&#13;
the firm and its creditors, an agreement that specifies measures for&#13;
revival. The purpose of such a system for failing firms (called "concursos"&#13;
or "concordatos" in Latin America) is to avoid the transaction costs, capital&#13;
losses, and managerial losses associated with the sale of illiquid assets.&#13;
Firms that do not improve their performance after a trial period under&#13;
concurso arrangements eventually declare bankruptcy and are liquidated. The&#13;
ratio of debt to total assets (i.e., "gearing") will be used to measure&#13;
solvency.&#13;
3. Foreign Exchange Exposure&#13;
Any firm's proclivity to undergo financial stress is determined&#13;
partly by its foreign exchange exposure. If the ratio of net foreign assets&#13;
to total assets ("net foreign exposure") is less than zero -- that is, if its&#13;
foreign liabilities exceed its foreign assets, as is common for most Argentine&#13;
firms dealing with foreign currencies -- a sufficiently large devaluation can&#13;

The dummy variable specification was chosen over random time components&#13;
because it is less restrictive. It also permits explicit testing of&#13;
hypotheses about the mean value of the dependent variable in different&#13;
periods. The size index was included because access of the firms to credit&#13;
and the structure of their product and factor markets are likely to be size-&#13;
dependent. 1/&#13;
Error components models, in addition to providing an appropriate&#13;
framework for hypothesis testing in panel data, yield information about the&#13;
structure of unexplained variation that is not obtainable from standard&#13;
regression analysis.  Specifically, one obtains estimates for a2 and a2, which&#13;
represent unexplained variation due to time-invariant differences in firms,&#13;
and a pure "noise" component, respectively.   Comparisons of a2 across&#13;
subgroups indicate the relative homogeneity of firms in each group with&#13;
respect to within-group average values of the dependent variables (conditioned&#13;
on regressands).  Comparisons of a2 across groups indicate the relative&#13;
predictability of the dependent variable after controlling for firm-specific&#13;
(conditional) means.&#13;
When working with a dependent variable that is not constrained to the&#13;
range (0,1), one or several firms often register values large enough to&#13;
1/ For some ratios, the size index is expressed in terms of deviations from&#13;
the average value for the period, i.e., X    - X    This is done to&#13;
eliminate colinearity with the dummy variables, thereby rendering dummy&#13;
coefficient estimates period-specific mean values of the dependen't&#13;
variable. Cost considerations prevented us from rerunning all ratios witth&#13;
this specification after it became apparent that colinearity was a&#13;
problem. Hence, gross margins, uncorrected financial costs, and all&#13;
"Stage 3" variables are analyzed with the size variable expressed in level&#13;
form. It is easy to show that the size coefficient and its estimated&#13;
standard error are invariant with respect to the choice of level versus&#13;
deviation form.&#13;

In a nutshell, the most striking stage 1 result is that uncorrected&#13;
earnings rates exhibit a strong negative trend9 but corrected earnings rates&#13;
follow a U-shaped pattern. Waturally, stage 2 findings reflect this same&#13;
distinction -- in this case it is manifested in the difference bctw.een&#13;
corrected and uncorrected average financial costs     but they also reveal&#13;
other sources of earnings fluctuation. GroSs margins for tradeabÂ½es appear to&#13;
follow the real exchange rate and account for between 10 percent and 20&#13;
percent of earnings rate variations, while gross margins are stable for&#13;
nontradeables. In addition, a major drop in production appears t:o drag down&#13;
both profits for importables and no-ntradeables in Ml8i, yet exportables&#13;
somehow avoid this problem. Finally, the ratios constructed in stage 3 of the&#13;
analysis show that, except for exportables, gearing clearly grows, liquidity&#13;
(as measured by the quick ratio) clearly falls, and reliance on f'oreign credit&#13;
clearly riseso&#13;

dummies in equation 3 are all equal, along with estimates of each veriance&#13;
component and the coefficient on size, The number of firms in each sectoral&#13;
subsample (after the exclusion of outliers) is reported as n. Hultiplying n&#13;
by the number of periods (11) gives the number of observations used in&#13;
estimating each sectorÂ½a error components model.&#13;
For this first financial indicator, tw^Co rounds of outlier exclusion&#13;
were performed to explore the sensitivity of the Tesults to outli'erso&#13;
Comparing the two sets of results, it maybe noted that earnings Tate&#13;
trajectories are generally "flattened6 by a second round of exclusion, but&#13;
their qualitative shapes are maintained. F statistiLcs improve mxainly for&#13;
nontradeables, which had only three (presumably very large) outl 8iers excluded&#13;
in the first round .-/  In contrast, the F statistics for exportables actually&#13;
falls after a second round of outlier omiss:lono  Wo doubt this reflects the&#13;
fact that, because Argentina does not export many industrial pro6ucts, our&#13;
exportable sample is small. (The full sample includes 9 exportable producers,&#13;
64 nontradeables producers, and 80 importable producers).&#13;
The first intertemporal pattern to be noted is that, as suggested by&#13;
table 4, these results reflect three basic phases0 During the first phase,&#13;
1977 through 1979, earnings rates were for the most part respect&amp;ble0 During&#13;
the second phase, 1980, earnings rates were somewhat lowezo  And during the&#13;
last phase, 1981, these uncorrected Tates moved wYell into the negative&#13;
range. Therefore, ignoring income due to chzanges in the real val.ue of&#13;
1/ The fact that outliers remained relatively large among nontradeables after&#13;
one round of outlier exclusion is easily co:. :..^  by compar.ng varience&#13;
components across sectors0 tThen ouch patterns emerge, OUr general&#13;
strategy in the analysis that follows bLelow is to check resultS foT&#13;
sensitivity to a second round of outlier exclusion0&#13;

monetary items, the industrial sector was transformed from one that generated&#13;
a liquid, realizable income stream into one that absorbed liquid assets and&#13;
grew only in the sense that the replacement cost of its assets was&#13;
increasing. This is consistent with the earlier conjecture that the&#13;
industrial sector's earning rates generally deteriorated after 1979, setting&#13;
the stage for financial crises. And because real peso interest rates were&#13;
generally substantially higher during 1980 and 1981, it is consistent with the&#13;
conjecture that financial costs played an important part in dragging down this&#13;
sector.&#13;
It is more difficult to identify cross-sectoral patterns of earnings&#13;
performance that are consistent with the conjectures in section I. Tradeables&#13;
do not appear to perform worse than nontradeables during the early phases of&#13;
the reforms. Nor do exportables appear to feel the impact of real&#13;
appreciation on their profits before importables. Thus, either these sector-&#13;
specific conjectures are incorrect, or the effects they describe are obscured&#13;
by other factors that influence this measure of performance.&#13;
2.   Corrected Earnings Rates&#13;
Corrected earnings rates, unlike those just considered, include all&#13;
income and losses due to changes in the purchasing power of monetary items and&#13;
are approximations to "real" rates of return on equity. As is apparent in&#13;
table 4, these rates are typically greater than uncorrected earnings rates&#13;
because most firms have carried fewer monetary assets than liabilities and&#13;
have thus tended to benefit from inflation (at given nominal interest&#13;
rates). Put differently, if creditors of the firms were to have supplied new&#13;
debt at a rate sufficient to maintain each firm's real obligations, the&#13;
resultant cash flows would have more than covered losses in the real value of&#13;
monetary assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Wotice in figure Ic that the relative sectorel perfomances come&#13;
closer to conjectures than do those in the uncorrected seriesG  axportables&#13;
start above importables and nontradeables, but their earnings then i-egin a&#13;
sharp descent while those of both other sectors improve0 Tnis is consistent&#13;
with conjecture 50 that redundant tariff protection initially inszlatec&#13;
importicompeting firms from the effects of real appTeciation0  In a2ddition,&#13;
the fact that importables relinquish primacy to nontradeables during 1980 is&#13;
consistent with the belief that redundant protection by this time lad been&#13;
eliminated. We tentatively conclude that our findings support these sector-&#13;
specific conjectures after all, and defer further cisocussion until the sources&#13;
of earnings fluctuation are examined in stage 20&#13;
Differences between corrected and uncorrected series are more&#13;
striking than cross-sectoral discrepancieso in addition to the fact that the&#13;
former are generally higher than the latter, two phenomema merit not'e. FirSt,&#13;
whereas uncorrected figures show that :.oWAs.     and nontradeables barely&#13;
restored their 1977 earnings rates in A979, corrected figures shou that in&#13;
1979 these sectors improved considerably over 1i970  Second, and ;:1E:. more&#13;
striking, uncorrected series show importables and nontradeables doing&#13;
extremely poorly in 1981 while correctod serEes show both doing extremely&#13;
well. Even without the benefit of our stage 2 o. c.-gc decomposition, it is&#13;
easy to offer plausible interpretations for both of&#143; these recults0&#13;
About the extremely high earnings rates of the late 137CO, recal&#13;
what was happening to the costs of peso and dollar credit0   Real peso Lnterest&#13;
rates, near zero around the middle of 977 and MYG, turned stvcnegy negative&#13;
in 1979 (see table 1),.  oreover, by 1976 and RS7S cfLective real inteTest&#13;
rates on dollar loans were between =40 ,:-,-   and -100 percent0   ' a firm&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
obtained, say, a sixth of its credit in foreign currency and financed half its&#13;
assets with debt, the implicit financial subsidy from foreign borrowing per&#13;
unit of net worth would have been on the order of 7 percent to 17 percent.-&#13;
Add to this the real peso rates of between -10 percent and -20 percent, and&#13;
the subsidy ranges from 15 percent to 33 percent. Hence, while nominal&#13;
interest rates were rising and holding down uncorrected earnings rates, net&#13;
debtors were profiting handily from inflation-induced reductions in the real&#13;
value of their liabilities. Importables and nontradeables reaped the largest&#13;
gain because they were the most heavily indebted in dollars, as is shown in&#13;
table 4.&#13;
The returns from dollar indebtedness explain the euphoria of the&#13;
financial sector in Argentina during the late 1970s. Speculators are said to&#13;
have gone from one bank to the next on bicycles, using dollar loans already&#13;
obtained to buy pesos which were invested and used as collateral for new&#13;
dollar credit. Indeed, according to popular legend, the "bicicleta" became&#13;
one of the more important pieces of capital equipment in the industrial&#13;
sector, and entrepreneurial enthusiasm for productive activities waned (refer&#13;
to conjecture 9).&#13;
Turning now to the post-devaluation period, it remains to explain a&#13;
discrepancy between corrected and uncorrected earnings rates even sharper than&#13;
that of 1979. Our interpretation of the 1979 boom does not seem to fit here,&#13;
inasmuch as real peso rates were often positive during this latter period and&#13;
major devaluations should have made effective dollar borrowing costs&#13;
1/ The gearing and foreign borrowing rates used here for illustration conform&#13;
to stage 3 findings presented elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
astronomical. To reconcile this paradox with the igures in table 'D recall&#13;
that the government began in 1981 to provide special exchange insurance to&#13;
firms with dollar loans, rendering the en_post coat of their foreign debts&#13;
quite negative. 1/  This explanation will be pursued further when fffise&#13;
average financial costs and foreign debt are examined in stages 2 and 3&#13;
below. Suffice it to say for now that the subsidy provided by this program in&#13;
1981 appears to have been tremendous    and on average, to have more than&#13;
compensated firms for any shortfall of operating earnings they suffered during&#13;
that year.&#13;
The picture of industrial sector earnings that emerges from our&#13;
corrected series seems somewhat contrary to popular belief, particularly that&#13;
for 1981o So it is appropriate to ask whether our figures suffer from serious&#13;
biases and whether they can be reconciled with what io known about the plight&#13;
of the industrial sector during the latter stages of reformso&#13;
On the issue of bias, three possible problems can be ident.ified0&#13;
First, there is likely to have been some understatement of input costs and&#13;
some understatement of revenues0 This occurs becauso the income measure&#13;
should be expressed in midyear prices, but some cost itemo in Argentine income&#13;
statements have been recorded year-and prices (i0e., deprecietion) and others&#13;
may have been recorded at lesso than their midyear value (e.g. mDaterialo)0 As&#13;
discussed in Tybout (1984), the sign of the net bias is unknowns but the&#13;
magnitude is directly related to the inflation rate0 Dhen inventoTies are&#13;
i/  Given that peso rates rise in the third quroter but earnings retes stay&#13;
the same, other factors must also play a roac0  These will ba examined in&#13;
stage 2. Appendix 3 describes the cxchanne insuTrnce proSgra in more&#13;
detail.&#13;

valued on a FIFO basis and depreciation is low, the bias in recorded income&#13;
will be positive; accordingly there is reason to suspect that for some firms,&#13;
profits have been understated in 1980 relative to other years. '/ Second,&#13;
Argentine firms have not recorded increases in the peso value of dollar debt&#13;
as a financial cost if that debt has been used to purchase inventories.&#13;
(Instead, inventories have been revalued at the rate of devaluation.) This&#13;
means that the interest saved by relying on foreign credit may have been&#13;
exaggerated in our figures for some firms, particularly when devaluation was&#13;
rapid. This would suggest that 1977 and early 1978 earnings figures are too&#13;
high relative to other years for firms that used dollar denominated credit for&#13;
inventory finance. Indeed, this factor may help explain the excess of&#13;
importable earnings rates over nontradeable earnings rates in those years.&#13;
Third, because of the Argentine accounting system's reliance on the wholesale&#13;
price index for inflation adjustments, cross sectoral variation in the&#13;
replacement costs of fixed capital have not been picked up by our data. In&#13;
this sense, the performance of the three sectors may have been more varied&#13;
than our numbers indicate.&#13;
All the above notwithstanding, the qualitative picture that emerges&#13;
from the corrected earnings rate series seems quite credible. Our figures are&#13;
consistent with the national accounts in that the relative prosperity of 1977&#13;
through 1979 comes through, as does the 1980 recessionary period. More&#13;
significant, the improvement in earnings performance during 1981 is not at all&#13;
1   Appendix 2 provides evidence on the magnitude of this bias for 30 firms in&#13;
our sample.  According to our calculations, it ranges from .03 (as a ratio&#13;
to net worth) in the last quarter of 1980 to .13 in the last quarter of&#13;
1981.&#13;

inconsistent with the fact that this year is characterized by unusua'&#13;
financial sector turbulence and an increase in the incidence of industrial&#13;
sector bankruptcy. First, firms may well have had poor operating e&amp;rnings&#13;
despite their reaping large implicit subsidies from the exchange insurance&#13;
programs. Whether this was the case cannot be established by simp7.y looking&#13;
at values, but should become clear when earnings are decomposed in stage 2 of&#13;
the analysis. Second, as noted by de Melo ana Venezoso (iB84), duTlng periods&#13;
of high inflation and high nominal interest rates, the balance of p^cwer&#13;
between creditors and debtors tends to shifto  Specifically, creditors have&#13;
the option of refusing to expand firms' indebtedness in step with niflation,&#13;
and of thereby imposing a large claim on firms' cash flow in the fcrm of&#13;
nominal interest charges.  (Figures for uncorrected earniLng rates cramatize&#13;
the drain on cash flow that would have occurred if this nad been c7editors'&#13;
general policy in 19810) In this sense firms were zelatively vulnerable to&#13;
liquidity crises; indeed, some of those which suffered an earnings shortfall&#13;
may have made creditors nervous enough to consinmate ouch crises by refusing&#13;
to extend new loans. Third, when creditors are maintaining the real value of&#13;
firms' debt, firms have incentives to maximize the subsidy by allocating this&#13;
net cash flow to nonmonetary assets, and hence to reduce their liquIdity0&#13;
This, too, contributes to the instability of the financial enviroz-.ant0&#13;
Most of the outliers which are found in our analysis occu' during&#13;
19810  This may well be traceable to the destabilizing influences of high&#13;
interest rates and inflation as outlined above0 LI A more detailcZ picture of&#13;

what happened to firms' financial structure during this year will be presented&#13;
in stage 3 of the analysis.&#13;
C. Stage 2: Decomposing Income&#13;
Thus far, attention has focused on the overall time path of earnings&#13;
rates, and on the possible link between these paths and macro statistics in&#13;
table 1. We now attempt to directly confirm or reject conjectures regarding&#13;
the importance of each factor by disaggregating earnings rates as in equations&#13;
(1) and (2).&#13;
1. Uncorrected Financial Costs&#13;
To begin, the analysis presented in stage 1 showed, in keeping with&#13;
popular opinion, that interest rates could well have been important in&#13;
dragging down uncorrected earnings rates during 1980 and 1981. To quantify&#13;
this effect, the time paths of firms' average nominal financial costs are&#13;
directly examined. 1/&#13;
Preliminary examination of the results in figure 3 confirms that the&#13;
nominal interest rate pattern presented in table 1 is roughly reproduced here.&#13;
Hence, not surprisingly, earlier speculation based on the table 1 figures does&#13;
apply equally to the firm-level series. Rising nominal rates apparently&#13;
played a large role in dragging down the r figures, particularly during 1981.&#13;
Nonetheless, several contrasts between our average financial cost&#13;
series and the Central Bank's interest rate series should be mentioned.&#13;
1/ More precisely, financial costs inclusive of devaluation losses and net of&#13;
financial revenues are constructed as a ratio to average debt net of&#13;
average monetary assets. Our inclusion of foreign currency items along&#13;
with monetary assets and liabilities is appropriate because devaluation-&#13;
induced losses are part of net financial costs. All rates, as usual, are&#13;
annualized. See appendix 2 for further discussion.&#13;

First, our figures are generally lower than the Central Bank's. The most&#13;
important explanation for this is probably that a large fraction of credit was&#13;
denominated in dollars and was therefore substantially cheaper than the peso&#13;
rate implies. This factor is particularly important in 1978 and 1981, when&#13;
spreads between the two types of credit costs are largest. 1/ Another&#13;
explanation for the low value of our average financial cost series may be that&#13;
our figures are somewhat biased. If some interest costs were recorded as&#13;
inventory expenses, as apparently was the case for some firms, average&#13;
financial costs will be understated. In addition, firms that have gone to&#13;
concurso (refer to section II.0) cease paying interest to their debtors, and&#13;
thereby pull down average figures if they are not excluded as outliers.&#13;
Second, our firm level nominal interest rate series is less volatile&#13;
than the Central Bank figures. This probably is an accurate representation of&#13;
the costs firms paid, as our figures represent weighted averages of peso and&#13;
dollar rates for loans obtained at different points in time.&#13;
Statistically, the fluctuations in nominal interest rates are clearly&#13;
significant for firms in all sectors 2/ but firm size does not appear to be&#13;
important for average interest costs.&#13;
2. Corrected Financial Costs&#13;
Recall next that in stage 1, considerable emphasis was placed on the&#13;
time path of real interest costs as a determinant of variation in corrected&#13;
1/ Recall that exchange insurance made dollar credit particularly cheap in&#13;
1981 (table 1 does not reflect this).&#13;
2/ A second round of outlier exclusion was performed for importable because&#13;
only 2 (very large) outliers were excluded in the first round, and&#13;
variance components estimated after this exclusion were much larger for&#13;
importables than for the other 2 sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
earnings rates, By examining micro level average flInancial ccosts corTected&#13;
for inflation, we can determine whether they indeed account for ezrnings rate&#13;
fluctuations in the way hypothesized. lWe can also measure the interest rate&#13;
effect at the micro level, and compare costs across sectors.&#13;
At a glance, figure 4 shows that during 1977-80, average real credit&#13;
costs are strongly correlated with the real peso rate series iE table 2.&#13;
Moreover, during the devaluations in 1981, this correspondence ed:lsappears.&#13;
Hence, inflation-corrected financial costs constructed from firE.s income&#13;
statements do support our earlier explanation of the U-shaped es-rnings paths&#13;
Wegative real financial costs prevailed until M90, and when rat&lt;es turned&#13;
positive in 1980, this source of revenue was eliminated. Duric3 1981 real&#13;
financial costs turned negative once more, apparently because fLrms had&#13;
significant dollar debt insured against exchange rate losses by the&#13;
goverrment's programso  We conclude that conjecture 9    w ^hich 'nolds that&#13;
financial costs were responsible fo- the domnfall of the industrial sector&#13;
during 1980 and 1981    is supported for the former year but not for the&#13;
latterO&#13;
The magnitude of t'ne subsidies reaped by industry via the financial&#13;
transactions is rather surprising. KWotice that the gains from czarying net&#13;
monetary liabilities provided tremendous incentives to obtain as muclh debt ac&#13;
possible, particularly in 1979 and 198I. The incentive disappears ain 1980,&#13;
when inflation slows and peso rates become large and positive. It then&#13;
reappears with the burst of inflation that  c.^s,.      the I98. devalua-&#13;
tions. Also interesting is the fact that the first period of !argE financIcl&#13;
subsidies is accompanied by much higher corrected earnings ratses then the&#13;

second period. The implication is that gross operating earnings during 1977-&#13;
79 were superior to those in 1981, and that during this latter period,&#13;
industry was much more dependent on favorable financial conditions for&#13;
survival. This survival was effectively bought by the government with its&#13;
increasingly scarce foreign exchange reserves, and helped pave the way for the&#13;
debt crises that have plagued Argentina ever since.&#13;
Not surprisingly, each sector's real interest rate trajectory is&#13;
significantly different from being "flat."   Period-to-period changes are also&#13;
quite significant, such as the jump in the first quarter of 1980, and the fall&#13;
in the second quarter of 1981. Finally, it should be noted that all sectors&#13;
have comparable error components, and are remarkably uniform in their&#13;
performance. This pattern indicates that no large outliers remained in our&#13;
samples after the first round of exclusion.&#13;
3.   Gross Margins&#13;
In the earlier discussion of corrected earnings rates, it was noted&#13;
that several conjectures regarding sector-specific performances were&#13;
consistent with earnings rates trajectories. These can be subjected to closer&#13;
scrutiny with data on gross margins. For example, if the real appreciation&#13;
that began in 1978 squeezed profit margins in the tradeables sector (see&#13;
conjecture 1), this should have shown up as distinct differences in gross&#13;
margin for firms producing tradeables vis a vis those producing&#13;
nontradeables. Moreover, if tariff reductions were privatized 1/ by import-&#13;
competing firms -- or if tariffs were so high that reductions did not subject&#13;
1/ Tariffs restrictions are privatized when import-competing firms become&#13;
importers and retail the imported goods at the prices they charged before&#13;
tariffs were reduced.&#13;

such firms to new competition (see conjecture 2) -- gross margin squeezes may&#13;
not have accompanied the opening of the economy to trade-&#13;
Turning first to the importables, notice that variation in&#13;
profitability does not appear to have been due to margin fluctuation in 1977,&#13;
1978, and 1979. In particular, the improvement in earnings registered by&#13;
importables in 1979 is accompanied by a mild margin reduction. On the other&#13;
hand, exportable earnings during 1977 through 1979 do move in sympathy with&#13;
gross margins, but changes in each are undramatic. The fact that margins&#13;
started off falling for exportables and rising for importables is consistent&#13;
with the conjecture that water in tariffs initially protected importables from&#13;
real appreciation. But, redundant protection does not appear to have been a&#13;
dominant force in these years, inasmuch as margin changes between 1977 and&#13;
1978 were too mild to be significant in any sector. In contrast, as already&#13;
revealed by table 4, gross margins seem to have contributed more to the net&#13;
earnings decline that beset the two tradable sectors in 1980, and they appear&#13;
to help explain the recovery of tradeables in 1981. In 1981, margins improved&#13;
considerably for both importables and exportables relative to nontradeables,&#13;
as would be expected with large real devaluations.&#13;
Tests of the significance of period-to-period changes in mean gross&#13;
margins indicate that the null hypothesis of no change can easily be rejected&#13;
at the a = .01 level for firms in the importable sector, while a .10 a level&#13;
is required to reject this for exportable firms. The result is not due to a&#13;
1/ For a detailed empirical documentation of these relative price changes,&#13;
see Wogart and Marquez (1984). These authors find a clear elimination of&#13;
redundant protection by August 1979, which they attribute mainly to&#13;
exchange rate policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38 &#13;
relative constancy of margins among exportable f-rms or to relatively large&#13;
variance components in the exportables sector. Raaher it appeare to be a&#13;
consequence of colinearity between the firm size index (which grows steadily&#13;
in mean value over time) and the time period dimies. 1/ DEspite this problem&#13;
of inference, hypotheses regarding the constancy of mean gross margins from&#13;
one period to another can easily be rejected at the 001 levelo For example,&#13;
the change in exportables' gross margins from the 1980.I111  1%92O111 carries&#13;
a "t" value of 2.20.&#13;
Perhaps the strongest support for conjecture 1 comes from the&#13;
nontradeables sector. For this sector, in contrast to both importable and&#13;
exportable performance, one finds an impressive relative stability in margins&#13;
across timeo Variance components are smaller than for the importable sector&#13;
(especially the purely random component), and the calculated F ratio is o85.&#13;
Both the small F statistic and the small value for a   indicate that relatiLve&#13;
to other sectors, firms producing nontradeables were uniformly Insulated from&#13;
any price shocks in factor or product markets that might have affected their&#13;
percentage mark-up over intermediate input costs0 2/ Because firms were&#13;
classified partly on the basis of whether the price of output from their&#13;
sector fluctuated dramatically, these results should be viewed zo indicating&#13;
that output price stability translated into margin stability, not that&#13;
exchange rate changes are the cause of margin fluctuation among tradable&#13;
firms.&#13;
I/ Refer to footnote 1D page 20O&#13;
2/ The low F ratio for nontradeables is not due to colinearity with the firm&#13;
size index, as there is no secular trend in the mean gross margino&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
Our figures no doubt reflect some inflation bias. A significant&#13;
fraction of firms in each of the sectoral samples apparently used "weighted&#13;
average" methods to value some of their inventories, and hence understated&#13;
materials costs by an amount roughly proportional to the rate of inflation.&#13;
Accordingly, although cross-sectoral comparisons of margin changes do provide&#13;
information on patterns of relative price pressure, it is unwise to attach too&#13;
much significance to within-sector intertemporal comparisons of a sector's&#13;
margins.&#13;
4. Overhead&#13;
Recall that overhead per unit sale exhibits a rough upward trend over&#13;
the sample period (from table 4). We now return to consider the behavior of&#13;
this component of earnings fluctuation in more detail. Referring to figure 6,&#13;
notice first that the upward trend in overhead costs appears to be&#13;
concentrated in the period 1977 to mid-1980 and thereafter gives way to&#13;
erratic fluctuation. This is somewhat puzzling because the period is one of&#13;
general prosperity, when capacity utilization would not be expected to be&#13;
falling. Moreover, this ratio would be expected to be positively correlated&#13;
with inflation. But when inflation falls in 1980, the ratio takes its largest&#13;
jumps. 2/ These results suggest that management was absorbing an increasingly&#13;
large share of total sales revenue during the boom period, but we cannot&#13;
determine whether this was going to advertising, executive salaries, research&#13;
and development, or some combination of all of these. Overhead expenses&#13;
1/ The inflation bias comes from the fact that depreciation on overhead capi-&#13;
tal (e.g., office equipment) has been expressed in year-end prices, where-&#13;
as all other elements of the overhead ratio are expressed in midyear&#13;
prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40 &#13;
maintained their expanded share of gross revenues as the economy moved into&#13;
recession in the latter part of the sample period.&#13;
The second thing to note is that although nontradeableo consistently&#13;
registered the highest overhead costs, the gap between their expenses and&#13;
those of tradeables evaporated after the devaluationo The jump in the export-&#13;
able sector is overhead costs between 1981i11 and 19861IV carriec a 0"t" rEtio&#13;
of 2.34, and the drop in nontradeable margins has a t   value o~' 2.69  These&#13;
results, coupled with those discussed above, suggest that overhead costs, far&#13;
from being fixed, absorb shocks in the face of relative price chiangeso&#13;
The final thing worth noting is that for importables and&#13;
nontradeables, overhead costs per unit sale are negatively coTrelated wAYith&#13;
firm sizeo This could indicate scale economies in management, L-marketing, or&#13;
some other nonoperating expense item. But, because overhead costs are defined&#13;
as being net of nonoperating incomes, this correlation may also reflect the&#13;
relative importance of such revenue to large mirws.&#13;
50 Asset Turnover&#13;
In discussing table 4 it was noted that a large drop In asset&#13;
turnover rates dragged down 1981 net earnings, at least for importables and&#13;
nontradeables. Comparing figure 7 with the macro series in table 1D notice&#13;
first that this drop is surprisingly comparable to the drop in industrial&#13;
output picked up by the national accounts0 It iCD moreover, highly&#13;
significant:  for importables the t   statistic associated with the change in&#13;
turnover rates between 198001V and 1981.R is 570D for nontradeables it is&#13;
1/ Nonetheless, referring back to figure SD one can find inso:ences in which&#13;
gross margins and overhead costs move in opposite directions0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
2.35. Because any bias in asset turnover rates is likely to be positively&#13;
correlated with inflation and because inflation was rising rapidly in 1981, it&#13;
seems safe to conclude that capacity utilization dropped greatly for both&#13;
sectors during this year. 1/ Nontradeables generally exhibit higher turnover&#13;
rates than importables, despite their consistently higher gross margins (refer&#13;
to figure 5). One wonders whether this reflects monopoly rents, relatively&#13;
high administrative and marketing costs (refer to earlier discussion), or&#13;
extraneous factors. These two sectors behaved similarly and that both seem to&#13;
have sustained production through the mid-1978 recession.&#13;
The exportables sector stands in stark contrast to importables and&#13;
nontradeables. Firms in this sector appear to have responded to the 1978&#13;
recession by cutting production, but they did not suffer a production short-&#13;
fall during 1981. These firms alone, somehow managed to increase mark-ups&#13;
without sacrificing sales volume, perhaps being in the next position to&#13;
benefit from the real devaluations of that year. On the whole, their&#13;
fluctuation in mean turnover rates is insignificant, but this insignificance&#13;
is partly to due to the heterogeneity of our sample (compare the variance&#13;
components for this sector to those for others). In sum, conjecture 6--that&#13;
capacity utilization was kept high until the 1981 recession--appears generally&#13;
supported by our findings, but should be revised to distinguish the behavior&#13;
of firms producing exportables from others.&#13;
1/ Average asset stocks, which appear in the denominator of turnover ratios,&#13;
are understated to the extent that the book value of inventories lags&#13;
behind their current value. Otherwise this ratio should be free of bias.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. Stage 3: Analysis of Financial Structure&#13;
In the discussion of stage 1 results, so-,e questions were raised&#13;
about the ability (and inclination) of firms to maintain safe finarcial&#13;
structures during the reform period, The issue appeared to be impoteant&#13;
during 1979 and 1981 (when the subsidies to be reaped from holding aet&#13;
monetary liabilities jumped dramatically) and during 198O (when eau,nings were&#13;

financial ratios in table 50&#13;
10 Liquidity&#13;
Current ratios remained fairly stable over the sample perfodD but&#13;
quick ratios deteriorated (table 4). We now return to examine the complete&#13;
trajectories of these indices and to offer interpretation for their behavior0&#13;
Recall that a corporation's liquidity determines its abi'ity to meet&#13;
all current obligations. When a firm must cover reductions in its earnings&#13;
stream by drawing down monetary assets relative to monetary liabi7Jtieo, the&#13;
safety of its financial structure is reduced0  in addition, if a firm is&#13;
tempted to increase its indebtedness because of negative effective interest&#13;
rates, and if the borrowed funds are not allocated to liquid assetse DimilaT&#13;
reductions in liquidity can occur.&#13;
The stability of our broadest liquidity measure (current assets ovez&#13;
current debt) is thus somewhat surprising (figure 8). Current rTz.ios exhibit&#13;
little fluctuation for importables producers, a mild downward trcnd aa.ong&#13;
nontradeables producers, and (except in 19801IV) a mild U-shaped     f: or&#13;
exportables producers0  Accordingly, no dramatic conclusiono can ?)e draxwn&#13;
though one might interpret these recults as wask evidence that 2Iquidity is&#13;

nontradeables in 1980, and the tradeables blip in both 1979 and ths post&#13;
devaluation period. None of the F statistics is significant at the 005 level,&#13;
and the jump in exportable current ratios during R981IV is the onl.y change&#13;
that registers a "t"2 ratio greater thEn 20&#13;
In terms of levels of liquidity, only the nontradeables sector&#13;
appears to encounter serious problems0 2/ Rferring to corrected earnings&#13;
rates and corrected financial costs, one finds no obvious reason w1hy this&#13;
should be true only of the nontradeable goods sectoro&#13;
The puzzles posed by current ratios are largely resolced by an&#13;
examination of quick ratios (current assets !eeLinventories divided by&#13;
current debts). 2/ It is apparent in figure 9 that liquidity is neither&#13;
stable nor relatively low for nontraded goods by this measure0   In other&#13;
words, firms adjusted to changes in the economic environment by sr$ifting their&#13;
current assets between monetary and nonmonetary items rather than by adjusting&#13;
total current assets relative to total current debt--and nontradeable goods&#13;
producers simply carried less inventories (perhaps because of inherent&#13;
characteristics of their products)o&#13;
Each sector's quick ratio foliows patterns similar to those of&#13;
corrected earnings rateso The liquidity of exportable producers starts&#13;
downward before that of importable producere in i979o TXen    durin.g t he perio6&#13;

understated during inflationary periods chould give the eader pause in&#13;
comparing these figures with those of industrial countries0&#13;

of extreme overvaluation, all sectors perform worse, with nontradeable goods&#13;
emerging as the relatively safe sector.&#13;
Despite those similarities, some notable contrasts can be drawn&#13;
between earnings performance and liquidity behavior. These probably reflect&#13;
the fact that, as earnings fluctuated, the return on net monetary asset&#13;
holdings was changing dramatically. Notice that although corrected earnings&#13;
recover sharply in the post-devaluation quarters that end our sample period,&#13;
quick ratios do not. This pattern may very well reflect the fact that the&#13;
recovery was largely caused by firms' holdings of net monetary liabilities,&#13;
particularly of foreign currency items. Accordingly, to accumulate real&#13;
monetary assets more rapidly than monetary liabilities would have meant&#13;
reducing earnings rates. This explanation is consistent with the fact that&#13;
exportable producers, whose recovery is gross earnings-based rather than&#13;
financial, do register an increase in liquidity. 1/&#13;
To pursue the issue of financial rather than gross earnings-based&#13;
profits, recall that stagnation and inflationary pressures were created&#13;
simultaneously toward the end of the reforms. Earnings (before interest)&#13;
remained low, perhaps because of the combination of rising real wages and&#13;
growing chaos. But the return from expanding net monetary liabilities was&#13;
tremendous (refer to corrected financial costs). So, both gross earnings and&#13;
effective financial costs encouraged firms to borrow as much as possible,&#13;
becoming net "consumers" of liquidity and fueling inflation in the process.&#13;
Preliminary calculations suggest that this last phase of our sample period,&#13;
1/ As already mentioned, by mid-1981 this sector was no longer a net debtor&#13;
in foreign currency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46 &#13;
unlike earlier periods, is characterized by expansion of net monetary&#13;
liabilities at a rate far in excess of inflation. 1/&#13;
2. Solvency&#13;
Recall that table 4 revealed a clear tendency of firms in cur sample&#13;
to increase their indebtedness over time. This tendency is now examined in&#13;
more detail, and some possible explanations are offered.&#13;
As reviewed earlier, corporate gearing is directly related to the&#13;
risk of insolvencyo Nonetheless, there two main circimstances in -aich firms&#13;
may increase their borrowing per unit of equity0 First, when gross earnings&#13;
rates on assets exceed average financial costs per unit of debt, increases in&#13;
a corporation's leverage will increase the rate of return on its equity. So,&#13;
as conjecture 9 suggests, one would expect the reforms to have induced firms&#13;
to increase their leverage when the real costs of borrowing were very&#13;
negative. Second, because growith of real net worth roughly corresponds to&#13;
inflation-corrected earnings1, firms that do not reduce their real indebtedness&#13;
when these earnings are negative will automatically be increasing their&#13;
leverage. So, as conjecture 8 suggests1, one wsould expect such increases to&#13;
have been most likely during the 1980 period0   1earing this in min&amp;,' we now&#13;
try to determine whether either phenomenon characterized the Azgen.tine reform&#13;
period.&#13;
The first thing to note is that there WaS not a major increase in&#13;
industrial leverage during the late 1970s, when financial costs wsere low and&#13;
the banking sector flourished0 True, industrial corporations incrcased their&#13;
I/ Such expansion need not have reduced quick ratios because they are&#13;
typically less than unity, and corrected earnings rates were no3itive0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
real indebtedness, but the growth of their real net worth (reflecting&#13;
operating earnings and the financial subsidies discussed earlier) was enough&#13;
to keep pace. -/ This pattern is counter to the popular notion that corporate&#13;
borrowing increased dramatically relative to total assets. It was not until&#13;
the subsidy disappeared in 1980 that leverage began to grow and that, not&#13;
coincidentally, problems for the banking sector began.&#13;
Note next that this sustained leverage growth that begins in 1980&#13;
coincides with the major drop in corrected earnings rates documented&#13;
earlier. 2/ It therefore appears that leverage responded not so much to&#13;
incentives to increase profits as to the necessity of covering losses. At&#13;
least during 1980, we thus find evidence supporting the conjecture that firms&#13;
were caught in a vicious cycle of growing debt obligations and falling&#13;
earnings.&#13;
Cross-sectoral differences in leverage also appear to carry a strong&#13;
message. The heavy reliance on debt by firms in import competing and&#13;
nontradeable good sectors explains why they respond more dramatically to&#13;
changes in (corrected) average financial costs. This factor appears to have&#13;
been particularly important during 1979, when average financial costs were&#13;
very low and gross earnings rates were fairly high (refer to figure 2).&#13;
1/ According to Central Bank statistics, the ratio of banking sector average&#13;
manufacturing loan balances to manufacturing output increases from .15 in&#13;
1977 to .20 in 1978. However, much of this reflects the displacement of&#13;
other forms of industrial credit, as will be discussed below.&#13;
2/ The increase in leverage would have been even more dramatic if the market&#13;
value of firm's assets (rather than their replacement costs) had been used&#13;
to calculate equity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48 &#13;
Looking to the statistical tests reported in figure 10C, one sees that&#13;
the null hypothesis that time dummies all have identical coefficien2s can be&#13;
rejected for each sector, except the exportable goods sector0 The .,.&#13;
statistics would have been much larger if it were not for the prob2.est of&#13;
colinearity of the time dummies with the firx'E~si%e indexO  Decause neither the&#13;
firm-zize index nor its standard error are affected by this pToblem, / we can&#13;
safely conclude that small firms were less heavily reliant on debt, cither by&#13;
choice or because of borrowing limits imposed by creditoros&#13;
It also is worth mentioning that the composition of industErial credit&#13;
changed dramatically in its origin and maturity during the sample --:1cd.  For&#13;
the thirty largest firms in our sample, banking sector loans went from 28&#13;
percent of total debt in 1976 to 63 percent in 198R 2/ This reflected the&#13;
financial sector booms, during which the manufacturing lones from banka went&#13;
from 5 percent of total manufacturing output in 2976 to 23 percent in 1980. 3/&#13;
(Statiatics for 1981 are not yet available)0  And as bank debt df.  Ec_--&#13;
commercial credit as the most important source of 4nductrial finance, long-&#13;
term loans displaced short=term loans0 For our sample of 30 srSge firme,&#13;
long-term bank debt went from 5 percent of total debt in 1976 to 34 pereent of&#13;
total debt in 19810IVO This largely refiecto increased foreign currency&#13;
borrowing, which under Argentine regulations xwga usually feasible and&#13;
profitable only for longer term maturities0&#13;

3. Foreign Currency Exposure&#13;
What remains is to elaborate upon changes in the net foreign currency&#13;
position of firms during the sample period. As already discussed, this&#13;
position was critical in determining ex post financial costs.&#13;
The results of sector-specific trajectories confirm that importable&#13;
and nontradeable goods producers relied more heavily on foreign credit than&#13;
exportable goods producers (figure 1). The discrepancy between exportables&#13;
and other sectors is most dramatic in 1981, when exportables producers&#13;
basically got out of net foreign currency indebtedness while other sectors&#13;
increased their use of these funds. This explains the divergence between&#13;
corrected average financial costs noted earlier.&#13;
Notice that major increases in foreign borrowing do accompany the&#13;
banking sector boom of the late 1970s. So, firms exploited the financial&#13;
environment during this period not by levering higher but by changing the&#13;
currency composition of their debt.&#13;
Perhaps the most noteworthy foreign borrowing pattern appears among&#13;
import-competing and nontradeable goods producers, which constitute the bulk&#13;
of our sample. Their net foreign debt remained stable and large in the face&#13;
of an imminent devaluation. This either reflects a lack of other sources of&#13;
funds, a shrewd anticipation of exchange insurance programs, or (not to rule&#13;
out possibilities) a patriotic display of confidence in the "tablita." The&#13;
fact that foreign debt continued to increase after one major round of&#13;
devaluations is less remarkable, given that one form of exchange insurance was&#13;
already in place. And because some types of foreign borrowing were not&#13;
insured, the increase may have partly reflected capital losses sustained by&#13;
the recipients of such loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
One last characteristic of the TeSults Ls that fÂ£irm size appears to&#13;
be uniformly significant in determining access to foreign credit. Given the&#13;
importance of access to dollar debt, this implies, at least to some degree,&#13;
that success during the stabilization and reform period in Arger'2inaE was&#13;
predicated on the size of one's corporation.&#13;
IV. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
By looking at the behavior Argentine reform period, ue have identi-&#13;
fied many phenomena heretofore neglected or misinterpretedo  Perhaps the most&#13;
fundamental lesson from our analysis is that extremely large subsidies were&#13;
provided to the Argentine industrial sector by way of negative effective&#13;
financial costs. These negative costs appeared first in the late S970s&#13;
because of the "tablitaDg then again in 1981 because of the exchange insurance&#13;
program.  The volume of this subsidy for any firm was directly related to its&#13;
debt, directly related to its exposure in foreign currency, an6 inveTsely&#13;
related to its stock of monetary assets0 So the incentives to assume a risky&#13;
financial structure were strong, and this clearly occurred.&#13;
During the late 1970e, fir-so appear to have substituted dollar debt&#13;
for peso debt, keeping their overall leverage stable0  But begInning in i8O0,&#13;
when earnings rates fell sharply, firms steadily increeased the.r reliance on&#13;
debt financeo So this year and thereafter0 come of the increae in firmso&#13;
finencial riskiness may have been due to distzeca borrowing0 The beginning of&#13;
the upward leverage trend corresponds to the emergence of banking sector&#13;
crises0 and may well have been a causal factor0&#13;
The earning rate fall of I900 wae caused in large part by the&#13;
teuporary appearance of positive real interect rates and the `bsence of&#13;

lucrative currency arbitrage possibilities. Also, among tradeable good&#13;
producers, it was exacerbated by a major reduction in gross margins --&#13;
probably reflecting the ongoing peso appreciation. Importable goods&#13;
producers, who may have benefited from redundant tariff protection, did not&#13;
exhibit the effects of this margin squeeze as early as exportable producers.&#13;
Although the reform experiment collapsed in 1981, negative average&#13;
financial costs were restored by the exchange insurance program, and the&#13;
industrial sector enjoyed a partial recovery in earnings. So, continued&#13;
reliance on dollar debt in the face of certain devaluation proved to have been&#13;
a shrewd policy. That reliance also contributed to the severe balance of&#13;
payments crisis, from which the Argentine government has yet to escape. The&#13;
industrial sector--probably the corporate sector in general--has consumed a&#13;
major resource transfer from the rest of the world, and the government has&#13;
been forced to assume the liability.&#13;
Although average corrected earnings rates were restored in 1981, the&#13;
financial environment was by then much more volatile than during the late&#13;
1970s. Not only were leverages higher and liquidity levels much lower than&#13;
before, gross earnings were reduced and highly variable. Both importable and&#13;
nontradeable goods producers suffered major reductions in capacity&#13;
utilization, and although price-cost margins improved with the maxi-&#13;
devaluations that ended the reform period, bankruptcies and concursos&#13;
multiplied.&#13;

Appendix 1: Data Preparation&#13;
The Sample&#13;
The initial data base for this study consisted of all 167 industrial&#13;
firms which reported a complete series of quarterly balance sheets and income&#13;
statements to the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange between 1976 and 1981. From&#13;
among these firms, 13 were excluded because they operated in the (heavily&#13;
regulated) petroleum and sugar refining industries. For the period 1976&#13;
through 1979, the data were collected on an annual basis, using financial&#13;
statements closed within 1 1/2 months of June 30. For the relatively turbulent&#13;
years 1980 and 1981, data were collected on a quarterly basis, using financial&#13;
statements closed within 1 1/2 months of the middle of each quarter. In all,&#13;
twelve observations were recorded for each firm, but because many financial&#13;
ratios involve the average of stocks over two periods, only 11 periods appear&#13;
in the analysis of the text. To ensure the internal consistency of each&#13;
observation, a number of income statement and balance sheet identities were&#13;
checked. Also, one case in which a merger took place was separated out.&#13;
Sample Coverage&#13;
Because the data base consists solely of corporations listed on the&#13;
stock exchange, it is not a simple or stratified random sample. Although it&#13;
is difficult to discern what implications this selection criterion has for our&#13;
results, the coverage of the sample in terms of sales represented for each 2-&#13;
digit CIIU classification can be noted. This is reported in Table A.1.&#13;

Adjustments for Inflation&#13;
Balance sheet items were used as reported, subject to satisfaction of&#13;
consistency checks. Given that laws governing firms in our data base required&#13;
inflation adjustment of fixed capital stocks, these balance sheets are roughly&#13;
on a current cost basis, with the exception of inventories.   Income statements&#13;
were corrected for inflation by scaling each entry by the ratio of the average&#13;
price level during the period of analysis to the average price level during&#13;
the reported fiscal period. Net imputed losses on monetary items (expressed&#13;
in mid-period prices) were then subtracted. Finally, each income statement&#13;
item was annualized by dividing by the fiscal period's duration (expressed in&#13;
months) and multiplying by 12. Given that detailed data on depreciation and&#13;
inventory valuation methods were unavailable, no further correction was made&#13;
to these items. Hence depreciations costs--having been stated in end-of-&#13;
period prices along with the fixed capital stock--are typically overstated,&#13;
and input costs for firms not using a LIFO valuation system are typically&#13;
understated. This latter bias is described in more detail in Tybout (1984);&#13;
some tentative calculations of its magnitude are presented in Appendix 2.&#13;
Firm Classification Criteria&#13;
Firms were classified according to whether their output was import&#13;
competing, exportable or nontradable. To accomplish this grouping,&#13;
information was examined on changes in domestic production, changes in&#13;
imports, the rate of protection, and changes in domestic prices of the type of&#13;
products being produced by the firm. In addition, consultations were held&#13;
with knowledgeable persons and firm executives from each sector analysed. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56 &#13;
most cases the firm's main product (as est&amp;bui.hed by consultation) was tasten&#13;
as the basis for its classification0&#13;
Firms in sectors for which exports or imports vewe negigible during&#13;
the reform period were classified as nontradeble goods producers0  (A check&#13;
was made to see that relative prices did not change drastically during thic&#13;
periodo)  Firms in sectors where either more than 5% of the totcl production&#13;
was imported, or relative prices adjusted downward considerably towerd the e n&#13;
of the reform periods, were classified as importing competing0 Minally, firms&#13;
in sectors that were exporting more then 5% of total production &amp;t the&#13;
beginning of the reform period were classified as belonging to the exportable&#13;
sector.&#13;

Appendix 2: Stock/Flow Ratios&#13;
Ratios involving both stock and flow variables can be confusing when&#13;
neither is constant over time. Such confusion is typically exacerbated by the&#13;
presence of inflation. This appendix first explains how the problem has been&#13;
dealt with in the relatively simple case of average financial costs and asset&#13;
turnover, then the measurement of net earnings rates is considered.&#13;
1.    Simple Stock-Flow Ratios:  Average Financial Costs and Asset Turnover&#13;
Suppose some flow, F, is to be measured relative to some stock, X,&#13;
which may grow or shrink over time. Also, suppose that this stock generates&#13;
the flow being analyzed at some unobservable rate f, so that if X were to&#13;
remain constant, the flow per period would be F=fX. Then, in the more general&#13;
case where X may be changing, the total flow it generates may be written as&#13;
F   fJ fXtdt.&#13;
where the fiscal period has been normalized to last from time t-O to time t-1,&#13;
and Xt is the stock X at time t.&#13;
This total, F, is what will appear in income statements prepared on&#13;
an historic lost basis. If X is assumed to be linear in time, then&#13;
F = f (X1 + X0)/2, and the rate f at which X generates the flow can be&#13;
stated in terms of observed variables&#13;
(1)     f - F/X,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
where X is the average of the initial and closing stock0 If F is total&#13;
financial costs and X is net endebtment, then f is clearly an apprzcimation to&#13;
the nominal average financial cost, it is the expicit contractual rate being&#13;
paid per unit debt. Alternatively, if F is total sales and X is tile asset&#13;
stock, then so long as the price of the asset stock grows at the general rate&#13;
of inflation (ioeo, real capital gains on assets are exactly zero), the ratio&#13;
f may be interpreted as the real rate at which the firm's assets generate&#13;
revenues: it is the flow in excess of that necessary to maintain the real&#13;
stock value I/&#13;
(2)   Calculating Net Earnings Rates&#13;
If prices were stable over time, the above discussion would suffice&#13;
to describe the calculation and interpretation of net earnings rates0&#13;
However, net income is recorded as a complex function of many var1ables, and&#13;
suffers from a variety of complicating biases during inflationary peTio6S0 2/&#13;
For the Argentine data, it is likely that input costs are understatedD and the&#13;
net loss on holdings of monetary items is erroneously neglected. There are&#13;
several possible, albeit imperfect approaches to dealing wTyith these problems.&#13;
I/    Financial analysts typically use the oxprescion given by equation (2).&#13;
EKowever, if it happens that x ic        cz:c..  exponentially over time, an&#13;
alternative procedure for estimating f is warrantedg&#13;
Â£ Fln(Xj/X2)/(Xn     )&#13;
Becauce this expression yields cstimates of f quite close to those&#13;
yielded by equation (1), it has not boan consetucted n trhe present&#13;
papero&#13;
2/    An algebraic representation of thece biases is pesoented iÂ£ Tybout&#13;
(1984).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
The first approach to measuring earnings rates is to view recorded&#13;
net income as basically a midyear earnings figure before adjustment for net&#13;
losses on monetary items. Support for this position comes from the fact that&#13;
all income statements items except depreciation expenses and devaluation-&#13;
induced capital losses are recorded at midyear prices, or less. Under this&#13;
assumption a monetary correction (expressed in midyear prices) should be&#13;
subtracted to arrive at real net income in midyear prices; then this figure&#13;
should be used to calculate real net earnings rates as in equation (1):&#13;
(2)           f  =  F-&#13;
X&#13;
where F is now net income adjusted for net losses on monetary items in&#13;
midyear prices, and X is average net worth.&#13;
The alternative approach is to argue that because Argentine&#13;
depreciation expenses have been converted to year-end prices, and because some&#13;
firms use a LIFO inventory costing system, net income is recorded in what&#13;
amounts to roughly year-end prices, save for the omission of a correction for&#13;
net losses on monetary items. Under this assumption, a monetary correction&#13;
expressed in year-end prices should be subtracted from reported earnings,&#13;
yielding a net income figure which should coincide with the excess of total&#13;
net worth growth over that amount of growth necessary to maintain its real&#13;
value (e.g., Tybout, 1984). 1/ Then, to calculate the adjusted earnings rate,&#13;
this corrected year-end income (which the variable F will now be interpreted&#13;
1/    That is, assuming no new share issues, share retirements, or dividends.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

net worth and initial net tiorth weighted by 2 plun the inflation rate (p'):&#13;
I2] + X0 ( + P ) 1 /2&#13;
There is some evidence that the midyear variant deScribee fitEr is&#13;
preferable to the year-end expression given by equation 3. SpecifEcally,&#13;
after the third quarter of 29G0, Argentine firms were required to  a^:*F&#13;
fully inflation-adjusted accounts as augzillay information0   ance we&#13;
collected these auxiliary accounts for 30 of the lergest fims in our data&#13;
baceD and compared them to the accounto these came firmS had prepared&#13;
according to pre -eNisting norms (i.e., the accounts used in our azalysis). R/&#13;
We found that when the OifSEli    aTop         ting incoQ)z figures&#13;

The results of this comparison led us to use equation (2) for the earnings&#13;
rate series analysed in the text; nonetheless, we calculated the alternative&#13;
series as well and confirmed that they are qualitatively similar. They are&#13;
are discussed at length in an earlier version of this paper.&#13;
Clearly sample figures overstate operating income, even when the&#13;
latter is measured in midyear prices. This is doubtless the influence of&#13;
input cost understatement, given that most firms were found to value their&#13;
inventories on a weighted average (rather than LIFO) basis. As expected, this&#13;
bias appears to be strongly correlated with the rate of inflation and reaches&#13;
a maximum of nearly .14.  The reader may find this information useful when&#13;
interpreting the discussions in the text.&#13;

Appendix 3: Exchange Rate Insurance and Swaps&#13;
After the reform experiment was abandoned in early 1981, various&#13;
schemes of insured exchange rates and swaps transactions were implemented by&#13;
the Central Bank. These policies replaced the earlier, less visible mechanism&#13;
by which the private sector had obtained cheap dollars, namely the&#13;
"preannounced devaluation" exchange rate regime. The insurance programs were&#13;
used to compensate private firms for devaluation-induced losses on dollar debt&#13;
that they might otherwise have borne, and also as an instrument to provide&#13;
incentives for external debt rescheduling. The swaps provided subsidies on&#13;
new dollar borrowing, and were used by the government to obtain readily usable&#13;
foreign exchange. In practice, as the government faced difficulties in&#13;
complying with swap contractual terms, they became a mechanism by which&#13;
private debt was converted into public debt. According to Central Bank&#13;
figures, such transactions amounted to $8,900 million in 1982.&#13;
Basically, there have been two schemes of exchange rate insurance and&#13;
two regimes of swaps. The first exchange rate insurance scheme (described in&#13;
Central Bank communications A31, A33, and A36) went into effect in June 1981,&#13;
covering all new foreign financial loans or renewal of financial loans which&#13;
became due from June 1981 to December 1981 and which were renewed for at least&#13;
540 days. Under this scheme, the Central Bank sold foreign exchange when the&#13;
loans became due at an exchange rate which was to be computed according to&#13;
specified rates. Initially, a fixed rate was to be used for the first six&#13;
months, and a coefficient of adjustment based on domestic wholesale prices&#13;
connected for international inflation for the rest of the contract period.&#13;
Later, under Central Bank CDmmunication A44, firms were allowed the option of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64 &#13;
indexing their insured exchange rate to the internal borrowing zatc minus the&#13;
30-day LIBOR rate. This change might not have been important at tee time of&#13;
its introduction, but later when the borrowing rate use oubject to &amp; Central&#13;
sank imposed ceiling lower than inflation, it raiced the amount of the oubsidy&#13;
to firms covered by the exchange insurance scheme0 Further changes were made&#13;
in September 1961, when firms were allowed to acquire exchange rate insurance&#13;
for debts already contracted and due before DacemEber i829, with the condition&#13;
that new terms be extended from a year and a half to three yearso&#13;
In July i982, the second basic regime of exchange rate insurance and&#13;
swaps went into effect. As a new government took poxwer, a duel exchange rate&#13;
system was instituted, one for commerce and another one for financlal&#13;
transactions0  The financial exchange rate was supposed to float, but as&#13;
authorities saw it climbing, a new ceiling was imposed0 Quantitative&#13;
restrictions were also established, and the Central sank stopped ?cuying&#13;
dollarEs to repay debts that were due0  tlhen foreiSn currency debt contracts&#13;
matured, firms were supposed to repay them with doliars purchased from the&#13;
Central Bank at insured rates0 In practice, however, the governuent was&#13;
unable to deliver hard currency and instead iscued titlea of doll.r-&#13;
denominated government debt. These titles became part of the                of&#13;
the Argentine external debt with bankso   Th e     c.Â¢e- : of privEts by public&#13;
debt was in fact not complete, as benks retained privatc inatrumcnto of debt&#13;
so collateral, not freeing private firms of t1hir obligetion to .         Tsac&#13;

have cost to obtain foreign exchange in the market. Moreover, exchange&#13;
insurance contracts could be obtained for transactions which in fact did not&#13;
involve either a financial or commercial debt. An individual or a firm could&#13;
request a loan and bring foreign exchange insurance into the country, sell the&#13;
dollars to the Central Bank, obtain the exchange insurance, then immediately&#13;
purchase dollars in the private market and repay the debt but keep the&#13;
exchange insurance contract. When the "debt" became due, the firm could then&#13;
use this contract to purchase foreign currency at a subsidized rate. This&#13;
type of transaction is popularly known as an "autoprestamo," or "loan to one's&#13;
self." Although Central Bank authorities are aware of procedures of this&#13;
type, the amount involved remains unknown. The Central Bank has requested a&#13;
new registry of all private debt, covered or not by exchange insurance,&#13;
including information such as income tax registration numbers. Although this&#13;
information is confidential, it is believed that an important proportion of&#13;
purchasers of foreign exchange decided not to reconfirm their registered debt.&#13;

            How the financial statements of Argentine
            firms reflected stabilization and reform attempts during 1976-81
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In 1976 Argentine policymakers launched
            a major program to remove controls on prices, interest
            rates, and international transactions. Simultaneously, they
            attempted to rid the economy of inflation. By 1981 these
            reforms had been abandoned, and the economy had returned to
            hyperinflation. This paper documents the reactions of firms
            to the major changes in the environment between 1976 and
            1981, and provides new evidence on why the reforms failed.
            The analysis is based upon the financial statements of 155
            publicly traded industrial corporations. These statements
            are corrected for inflation and used to construct a time
            series of financial performance indicators for each firm.
            Values of these indicators are then compared over time for
            three major firm types: exportable goods producers,
            importable goods producers, and nontradeable good producers.
