SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION&#13;
This paper uses data from the National Socioeconomic Survey for 1978&#13;
(SUSENAS 1978) to give a profile of poverty in Indonesia. Households are&#13;
classified into the poor, better-off and rich categories according to their&#13;
levels of per capita consumption, with a breakdown into urban and rural areas&#13;
of Java and the Outer Islands. Defining "the poor" as the two lowest&#13;
quintiles of the distribution of the population ranked by their households'&#13;
levels of per capita consumption, the overall urban incidence of poverty is&#13;
14% compared with 42% for rural households. For each of the areas, the&#13;
incidence of poverty is considerably lower in the Outer Islands than in&#13;
Java. Different categories of households are then compared in terms of their&#13;
characteristics; these can be divided into those associated with the causes&#13;
and those associated with the consequences of poverty.&#13;
Of the factors associated with the causes of poverty, the paper&#13;
shows that the poor have larger families and also a larger number of members&#13;
in the labor force. However, each member of the labor force in a poor&#13;
household has more dependents to support on average than one from a better-off&#13;
or rich household. The heads of poor households have less education, as do&#13;
their household members. Education level has a direct bearing on the&#13;
probability that a household is poor; the incidence of poor households is&#13;
inversely related to the level of educational attainment of the household&#13;
head. Members of poor households change jobs frequently and more of those&#13;
already working are prepared to accept additional jobs, while more of those&#13;
who are not working would be willing to accept a job if available. The poor&#13;
are more likely to be looking for work than those who are not poor, especially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
in urban areas. The poor are more likely to have agriculture as their main&#13;
source of income than others. In rural areas, households are more likely to&#13;
be engaged in nonagricultural activities if the size of their landholding is&#13;
inadequate when compared to their household size. Among households for whom&#13;
agriculture is the main source of income, a smaller proportion of poor&#13;
households work on their own land compared with other households. Thus&#13;
control over land can be linked to the income levels of households.&#13;
Of the factors associated with the consequences of poverty, the poor&#13;
are found to spend a much larger share of their total budget on food and&#13;
correspondingly smaller shares on other categories of consumption, such as&#13;
expenditures related to schooling and health. Within the food category, they&#13;
spend the greater part of the budget on carbohydrates, namely rice, cassava&#13;
and their byproducts, and relatively much smaller shares for sources of&#13;
protein like fish, meat and eggs. Thus the nutritional content of foods&#13;
consumed by the poor and those who are not is quite dissimilar.&#13;
The paper documents the inferior living conditions of the poor in&#13;
their housing structure and amenities, such as the availability of water and&#13;
electricity. In social services, a smaller proportion of the children of the&#13;
poor attend school beyond the primary level. The poor do not receive health&#13;
care of as good a quality as the other groups: they are less likely to use&#13;
physicians and more likely to rely on less-qualified health personnel, such as&#13;
folk doctors.&#13;
Related work deals with some of the individual topics in this paper&#13;
in greater detail, with a view of reaching a better understanding of the&#13;
causes and consequences of poverty in Indonesia.&#13;

RESUME ET CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Cette etude sur la pauvrete en Indonesie a 6te realisee a partir&#13;
des donnees de l'Enquete socioeconomique nationale de 1978 ( SUSENAS 1978).&#13;
Apres ventilation en zones urbaines et rurales de Java et des autres iles,&#13;
les menages ont 6te classes en trois cat6gories (pauvres, aises et riches)&#13;
selon leur niveau de consommation par habitant. Si 1'on d6finit comme&#13;
pauvres les menages appartenant aux deux quintiles inf6rieurs de la&#13;
population ainsi classee, il apparait que l'incidence de la pauvrete est de&#13;
14% dans les regions urbaines, contre 42 % en zones rurales; en outre, dans&#13;
les campagnes comme dans les villes, elle est considerablement moindre dans&#13;
les autres iles qu'a Java. L'etude analyse ensuite ce qui diff6rencie les&#13;
menages pauvres des autres en distinguant, parmi leurs caracteristiques,&#13;
entre causes et consequences de la pauvrete.&#13;
S'agisssant des facteurs de pauvrete, l'etude montre que les&#13;
pauvres ont des familles plus nombreuses, dont un plus grand nombre de&#13;
membres sont employ6s.   Mais, en moyenne, le nombre de personnes a charge de&#13;
chaque travailleur est plus elev6 dans les m6nages pauvres que dans les&#13;
menages ais6s ou riches. Les chefs de famille - et les membres- des menages&#13;
pauvres sont moins instruits. Le niveau d'education est directement li6 a&#13;
la probabilit6 de pauvret6 des menages; l'incidence de la pauvrete dans les&#13;
menages est inversement proportionnelle au niveau d'education atteint par le&#13;
chef de famille. Les membres des familles pauvres changent souvent de&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
travail; lors qu'ils ont deja un emploi, ils acceptent facilement de faire&#13;
les travaux suppl6mentaires, et s'ils sont en chomage, ils sont prets a&#13;
prendre le premier travail qui leur est offert.   Les pauvres ont plus&#13;
tendance a chercher du travail que les autres, surtout dans les zones&#13;
urbaines. L'agriculture est souvent leur principale source de revenu. Dans&#13;
les r6gions rurales, les m6nages qui ont des activites non-agricoles sont&#13;
g6neralement ceux dont la propriete a une superficie insuffisante par&#13;
rapport a la taille de la famille. Parmi les menages dont la principale&#13;
source de revenu est l'agriculture, les m6nages pauvres qui travaillent sur&#13;
leurs propres terres sont, proprotionnellement, peu nombreux. La possession&#13;
de terres peut donc etre liee au niveau de revenu des menages.&#13;
Parmi les caract6ristiques qui sont des consequences de la&#13;
pauvrete, l'etude montre que les pauvres consacrent une partie beaucoup plus&#13;
importante de leur budget total a l'alimentation et donc une part&#13;
proportionnellement plus faible aux autres postes de depenses de&#13;
consommation, par exemple aux depenses liees a l'education et a la sante.&#13;
Ils achetent surtout des produits riches en glucides, comme le riz, le&#13;
manioc et leurs sous-produits, relativement moins de produits riches en&#13;
proteines tels que le poisson, la viande et les oeufs. La composition&#13;
nutrionnelle des aliments consommes par les pauvres et les autres est donc&#13;
tres differente.&#13;
L'6tude montre aussi que dans le domaine de l'habitat - logement&#13;
et viabilite (acces a l'eau et a 1'electricite) - les conditions de vie des&#13;
pauvres sont plus mauvaises que celles des autres couches de la population.&#13;
S'agissant des services sociaux, une proportion plus faible des enfants des&#13;
menages pauvres poursuivent leurs etudes au dela du primaire. Les pauvres&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ne recoivent pas-des soins de sante d'aussi bonne qualite que les autres&#13;
groupes: ils ont plus souvent recours a du personnel sanitaire peu qualifie&#13;
(medecins traditionnels) qu'a des docteurs.&#13;
D'autres 6tudes, qui visent a mieux faire comprendre les causes et les&#13;
consequences de la pauvrete en Indonesie, traitent plus en detail certains&#13;
des sujets couverts dans ce document.&#13;

RESUMEN Y CONCLUSIONES&#13;
En este trabajo se hace una descripci6n de las caracteristicas&#13;
de la pobreza en Indonesia utilizando los datos del Estudio Socioecon6mico&#13;
Nacional de 1978 (SUSENAS 1978). Las unidades familiares se clasifican en&#13;
tres categorias --pobres, en mejor situaci6n y ricas-- de acuerdo con sus&#13;
niveles de consumo per capita, haciendose un desglose en zonas urbanas y&#13;
zonas rurales de Java y las islas exteriores. Al definir como "pobres" a&#13;
los dos quintilos mas bajos de la poblaci6n clasificada seguln niveles de&#13;
consumo per cApita de las unidades familiares, la proporci6n general de la&#13;
pobreza en los centros urbanos es del 14% , en comparaci6n con el 42% que&#13;
corresponde a las unidades familiares de los medios rurales. En cada una&#13;
de las zonas, la frecuencia de los casos de pobreza es considerablemente&#13;
menor en las islas exteriores que en Java. Luego se comparan diferentes&#13;
categorias de unidades familiares segun sus caracteristicas; 6stas pueden&#13;
dividirse entre las que estAn asociadas a las causas de la pobreza y las&#13;
vinculadas a sus consecuencias.&#13;
Con respecto a los factores asociados a las causas de la&#13;
pobreza, el estudio muestra que los pobres tienen familias mAs numerosas y&#13;
tambien un mayor nuxmero de sus miembros en la fuerza laboral. Sin&#13;
embargo, cada miembro de la fuerza laboral que pertenece a una unidad&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
familiar pobre tiene como promedio mas personas a su cargo que un miembro&#13;
de una unidad familiar en mejor situaci6n o rica. Tanto los jefes como&#13;
los miembros de las unidades familiares pobres tienen menor grado de&#13;
educaci6n. El nivel de educaci6n tiene que ver directamente con la&#13;
probabilidad de que una unidad familiar sea pobre; el numero de unidades&#13;
familiares pobres es inversamente proporcional al nivel de educaci6n&#13;
alcanzado por el jefe de familia. Los miembros de las unidades familiares&#13;
pobres cambian de empleo frecuentemente y un mayor n6umero de los que ya&#13;
trabajan estan dispuestos a aceptar empleos adicionales, en tanto que un&#13;
numero mAs alto de los que no trabajan estarian dispuestos a aceptar&#13;
empleos si estuvieran disponibles. En una comparaci6n entre pobres y no&#13;
pobres, es mayor la probabilidad de que sean los primeros los que busquen&#13;
empleo, especialmente en las zonas urbanas. La probabilidad de que la&#13;
agricultura sea la fuente principal de ingreso es mayor entre los pobres&#13;
que entre los demas. En las zonas rurales, es mAs probable que las&#13;
unidades familiares se ocupen en actividades no agricolas si el tamaiio de&#13;
su explotaci6n es insuficiente comparado con el tamaiio de la unidad&#13;
familiar. Entre las unidades familiares para las cuales la agricultura es&#13;
la principal fuente de ingreso, la proporci6n de familias pobres que&#13;
trabajan en tierras de su propiedad es menor que la de familias de otros&#13;
grupos. Asi pues, el control de la tierra puede vincularse a los niveles&#13;
de ingreso de las unidades familiares.&#13;
Con respecto a los factores vinculados a las consecuencias de la&#13;
pobreza, cabe constatar que los pobres gastan una proporci6n mucho mayor&#13;
de su presupuesto total en alimentos y proporciones correspondientemente&#13;
menores en otras categorias de consumo, tales como educaci6n y salud.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Dentro de la categoria de alimentos, los pobres gastan la mayor parte de&#13;
su presupuesto en hidratos de carbono, a saber, arroz, yuca y sus&#13;
derivados, y proporciones relativamente mucho menores en fuentes de&#13;
proteina, como pescado, carne y huevos. Por lo tanto, el contenido&#13;
nutritivo de los alimentos que consumen los pobres y los que no lo son es&#13;
bastante diferente.&#13;
El estudio revela las inferiores condiciones de vida de los&#13;
pobres en lo que respecta a la estructura de sus viviendas y a los&#13;
servicios con los que cuentan, como agua y electricidad. En cuanto a los&#13;
servicios sociales, es mas pequeiia la proporci6n de los hijos de los&#13;
hogares pobres que asisten a la escuela con posterioridad al nivel&#13;
primario. Los pobres no reciben servicios de salud de tan buena calidad&#13;
como los otros grupos; es menos probable que los pobres utilicen los&#13;
servicios de un medico y mas probable que busquen en su lugar los de&#13;
personal de salud menos calificado, como curanderos.&#13;
Otros trabajos conexos tratan en mayor detalle determinados&#13;
temas abordados en este estudio, con el prop6sito de llegar a una mejor&#13;
comprensi6n de las causas y consecuencias de la pobreza en Indonesia.&#13;

This paper was prepared under Research Project 672-19, "Poverty,&#13;
Fertility and Human Resources in Indonesia". The authors would like to&#13;
express their appreciation to the Central Bureau of Statistics of Indonesia&#13;
for making available the SUSENAS 1978 data tapes to the project, and to Vilma&#13;
Mataac and Fereshteh Noghreh for excellent research assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The purpose of this paper is to give a brief description of&#13;
households in Indonesia with a view of comparing and contrasting poor and&#13;
nonpoor households. It is meant to be a snapshot, capturing at a given point&#13;
in time different aspects of what households do and how they live, thereby&#13;
providing a background for further analytical work to be treated in several&#13;
subsequent papers.&#13;
The paper relies on the data tapes of the National Socioeconomic&#13;
Survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics in 1978 (SUSENAS 1978).&#13;
The survey was conducted in four rounds, with over 6,000 households&#13;
interviewed in each of the rounds. The data in this paper come from the&#13;
second round of the survey which was conducted in May 1978.&#13;
The sections which follow deal in turn with the geographical&#13;
distribution of poverty; demographic aspects of poverty; economic and non-&#13;
economic activities of individuals; sources of household income; consumption&#13;
patterns; housing conditions; and schooling and health. The emphasis will be&#13;
on differences between poor and nonpoor households throughout.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2-&#13;
I.       Geographical Distribution&#13;
In this section we begin the profile of poverty in Indonesia by&#13;
describing where the poor are located geographically. We do not attempt to&#13;
define objectively a poverty line for Indonesia since we feel that such a&#13;
line, however carefully defined, necessarily incorporates many arbitrary&#13;
assumptions. For purposes of comparing different groups of the population, we&#13;
classify households into three groups according to their levels of per capita&#13;
consumption expenditures. In this paper, "the poor" will refer to the two&#13;
lowest quintiles (or 40%) of the distribution of the population ranked by&#13;
their household's level of per capita consumption expenditure; "the better-&#13;
off" will refer to the next two quintiles; and "the rich" will refer to the&#13;
top quintile (or 20%). A household or an individual is said to be in&#13;
poverty" if it or he belongs to the "poor" group.&#13;
Table 1.1 gives the incidence of poverty, the proportion of&#13;
households classified as poor, that is, those belonging to the lower 40% of&#13;
the per capita expenditure distribution, for urban and rural areas of Java and&#13;
the Outer Islands. The figures show that, by this definition, the overall&#13;
urban incidence of poverty is 14% compared with 42% for rural households; the&#13;
urban-rural difference holds for Java and the Outer Islands separately as&#13;
well. For each of the areas, the incidence of poverty is considerably lower&#13;
in the Outer Islands than in Java.&#13;
Since rural Java has a higher incidence of poverty than Indonesia as&#13;
a whole, it has more than its share of the poor and less of the rich; rural&#13;
Java contains 55% of all households but 77% of poor households and only 25% of&#13;
rich households. The three remaining areas have less than their share of the&#13;
poor and more of the rich. Thus, with a share of 11% of all households, urban&#13;
Java has 5Z of the poor households, and 25% of the rich households.&#13;

Rural households constitute 83% of all households in Indonesia.&#13;
Combined with the higher incidence of poverty among them compared with urban&#13;
households, this means that nearly all, 94%, of poor households are found in&#13;
rural areas according to the definition of poverty used here. The choice of a&#13;
different definition would give quantitatively different figures, but the&#13;
results would be qualitatively no different from those reported in this paper.&#13;

II.      Demographic Characteristics&#13;
II.1     Household Size, Number of Adults and Dependency Ratios&#13;
Studies of income distribution have found that poor households tend&#13;
to be larger than better-off ones when a household is classified as being poor&#13;
or not on the basis of its level of per capita income or consumption&#13;
expenditures. Moreover, this result is robust with respect to the&#13;
standardization for household size; when the classification of households is&#13;
based on income or consumption per adult-equivalent, the poorer households&#13;
tend to be larger as well. It follows then that the incidence of poverty for&#13;
people is higher than for households. Moreover, larger households usually&#13;
have more children, as well as a larger proportion of children in the total.&#13;
Hence the incidence of poverty falls more heavily on children than it does on&#13;
adults.&#13;
Indonesia is no exception. In Table 2.1 we give the proportion of&#13;
poor households, those whose members belong to the two lowest quintiles of the&#13;
per capita consumption expenditure distribution. As expected, the proportion&#13;
of the population who are poor is higher than that for households, showing&#13;
that poorer households are indeed larger than better-off ones. In addition,&#13;
the incidence of poverty among children under ten years of age is&#13;
significantly higher than that for the population as a whole; thus poorer&#13;
households are also ones with more children.&#13;

Table 2.2 gives a breakdown of household members into three age&#13;
groups for poor, better-off and rich households in urban and rural areas of&#13;
Java and the Outer Islands. Poor households on average have more members in&#13;
each age category, children aged 0-5, children aged 6-9 and those aged 10 and&#13;
over, than nonpoor households. They also have a larger number of members in&#13;
the labor force. The labor force participation rates for those ten years of&#13;
age and over are not very different for poor, better-off and rich households&#13;
in a given region. However, there are large differences in participation&#13;
rates across regions. First, urban participation rates are substantially&#13;
lower than rural rates in both Java and the Outer Islands. Second, within&#13;
either urban or rural areas, participation rates are lower in the Outer&#13;
Islands than they are in Java.&#13;
Poor households have more people working as well as more people to&#13;
support. The net outcome can be seen in the dependency ratios given in Table&#13;
2.2 and defined in several different ways. First, a larger proportion of&#13;
members of poor households are children under ten compared with nonpoor&#13;
households. Second, each household member over ten in a poor household has&#13;
potentially more members under ten to support than one from a nonpoor&#13;
household. Third, taking the existing labor force participation into account,&#13;
each member of the labor force in a poor household has more dependents on&#13;
average than one from a better-off or rich household. In rural Java the&#13;
number of dependents in poor households is .76, while in urban areas of the&#13;
Outer Islands it is as high as 1.59.&#13;
To conclude, poorer households are handicapped from a demographic&#13;
perspective. They are larger and have a larger proportion of children who&#13;
need to be supported. Although poor households also have more members in the&#13;
labor force than nonpoor households, this is not enough to make up for the&#13;

larger numbers of children. The potential dependency ratio for poor&#13;
households is larger than for nonpoor households. The actual dependency ratio&#13;
follows the same pattern.&#13;
II.2     Poverty and Characteristics of the Household Head&#13;
In addition to the demographic characteristics of households, we&#13;
compare poor and nonpoor households in terms of some of the characteristics of&#13;
their household heads: sex, marital status, age and level of educational&#13;
attainment.&#13;
Table 2.3 gives the distribution of households by the sex, marital&#13;
status, age group and level of educational attainment of the household head,&#13;
as well as the proportion of households in each category which are poor. In&#13;
rural Java, 20% of households are headed by women, compared with 14% in urban&#13;
Java. The proportion of poor households among female-headed households is&#13;
lower in rural Java than among those headed by men, however. In urban areas,&#13;
as well as rural areas of the Outer Islands, households headed by women are&#13;
more likely to be poor than ones headed by men.&#13;
When we classify households by the marital status of the household&#13;
head as well as sex, we see that most of the male heads are married. In&#13;
contrast, the female heads are mostly widowed or divorced, although a number&#13;
of them are single or married. The proportion of household heads who are&#13;
single is higher in urban than in rural areas for both males and females in&#13;
both Java and the Outer Islands. For female-headed households, the incidence&#13;
of poverty is typically higher when the head is widowed or divorced than when&#13;
she is single or married.&#13;

The incidence of poverty rises with the age of the household head up&#13;
to the 40-49 age group in urban Java and rural areas of the Outer Islands, and&#13;
up to the 30-39 age group in the other two areas; it then declines for the&#13;
older age groups.&#13;
Differences in the levels of educational attainment of household&#13;
heads between Java and the Outer Islands and between corresponding areas are&#13;
shown very clearly in Table 2.3. For example, in urban Java 21% of household&#13;
heads have had no schooling, compared with 44% in rural Java. On the other&#13;
side, 31% of household heads in urban Java have had more than primary&#13;
education, compared with 4% of those in rural Java. The level of educational&#13;
attainment for household heads is considerably lower in rural compared with&#13;
urban areas.&#13;
Moreover, education level has a direct bearing on the probability&#13;
that a household is poor; the incidence of poor households is inversely&#13;
related to the level of educational attainment of the household head, as is&#13;
evident from the second panel of Table 2.3. Within any education class,&#13;
however, variations exist in the proportions of poor households between urban&#13;
and rural areas, and between Java and the Outer Islands.&#13;
Although the sex of the household head does not appear to be related&#13;
to the incidence of poverty for a given population group, the level of&#13;
educational attainment of the household head clearly is.&#13;

III.     Economic and Noneconomic Activities&#13;
In this section we look at the activities of individuals in poor,&#13;
better-off and rich households. We then focus in turn on the working&#13;
population, those looking for work and those engaged solely in nonmarket&#13;
activities.&#13;
I11.1    Activities of Individuals&#13;
Table 3.1 is an attempt to classify all individuals aged ten and&#13;
over according to their activities over a one-week period. Because the&#13;
SUSENAS 1978 questionnaire recorded what individuals did on different days, we&#13;
are able to gain some insight into their mix of activities during the week&#13;
preceding the survey.&#13;
We classify the activities into three major categories: being&#13;
employed, looking for work, and doing nonmarket work. The category employed&#13;
includes working, and having a job but being away from work; the category&#13;
doing nonmarket work includes attending school, taking care of the house, and&#13;
doing other nonmarket activities. Some people can be neatly classified into&#13;
one of these three categories: employed (working and/or away from work);&#13;
looking for work; and doing nonmarket work (attending school and/or taking&#13;
care of the house and/or doing other nonmarket work). A certain proportion of&#13;
individuals, however, performed more than one activity. For example, 9% of&#13;
the urban poor in Java did nonmarket activities in addition to working.&#13;
Survey questions which force individuals to be classified into only one&#13;
category would miss the fact that many people in fact do not fall clearly into&#13;
just one category. It should also be observed that a large number of&#13;
individuals carry out more than one activity within the nonmarket category.&#13;

In fact, a great many of them both attend school and take care of the house.&#13;
A sizeable proportion both attend school and perform other nonmarket work.&#13;
Table 3.1 shows that, for both males and females, the proportion&#13;
employed, that is, those who worked during the reference week whether or not&#13;
they also did other things, is substantially higher in rural than in urban&#13;
areas. Correspondingly, the proportions looking for work or doing nonmarket&#13;
activities are lower in rural areas. For men, the proportions employed do not&#13;
differ much between Java and the Outer Islands, but for women they are much&#13;
higher in Java; for example, 20% of women in urban areas of the Outer Islands&#13;
are employed compared with over 30% in urban Java.&#13;
The proportions of women employed and also doing nonmarket work are&#13;
higher than for men; the proportion looking for work is lower. The majority&#13;
of women doing nonmarket work are taking care of the house.&#13;
Among males within a given region, a larger proportion of the poor&#13;
are away from work for the entire reference period compared with the&#13;
nonpoor. The proportion who both worked and did nonmarket work is lower for&#13;
the poor than the nonpoor. The poor are more likely to be looking for work&#13;
than the nonpoor, especially in urban areas. Among females, a larger&#13;
proportion of the poor take care of the house'than the nonpoor.&#13;
III.2    The Employed&#13;
In this section we consider only those who are employed, that is,&#13;
those who worked or were away from work during the reference week but who&#13;
could have performed other activities as well. Table 3.2 gives a distribution&#13;
of employed persons by their employment status and also the average number of&#13;
hours that they worked during the reference week.&#13;

For both males and females, the proportion of employees in the total&#13;
is higher in urban than rural areas for both Java and the Outer Islands. And,&#13;
within urban or rural areas, the proportion of employees is higher in Java&#13;
than in the Outer Islands. Within each region the proportion of employees is&#13;
higher among males in urban areas, but lower among males in rural Java and the&#13;
poor in rural areas of the Outer Islands. As would be expected, the propor-&#13;
tion of unpaid family workers is higher in rural areas.&#13;
In Table 3.3 we present some statistics on employed persons: the&#13;
proportion whose job during the reference week was the same as that held&#13;
during the three months preceding the survey; the proportion with at least one&#13;
additional job besides the primary one, and the number of hours worked during&#13;
the reference week on all additional jobs; and the proportion willing to&#13;
accept an additional job if time were available. We see that people in rural&#13;
areas are more likely than urban people to have changed jobs. The poor are&#13;
more likely to have done so than the nonpoor in all regions except in rural&#13;
areas of the Outer Islands. The proportion with additional jobs is&#13;
considerably higher in rural than in urban areas, and the number of hours&#13;
worked on all additional jobs for those having them is quite high at usually&#13;
more than 15 hours per week.&#13;
A large proportion of employed persons are willing to accept&#13;
additional jobs if time were available; the figure is over 20% for most groups&#13;
in all regions and is as high as 46% for the poor in rural Java. In general,&#13;
more of those in rural areas are willing to accept additional jobs. Moreover,&#13;
for both urban and rural areas in Java and the Outer Islands, a higher&#13;
proportion of the poor said that they would accept an additional job compared&#13;
with the better-off and the rich.&#13;

III.3    Those Looking for Work&#13;
Table 3.4, which refers to all those individuals who looked for work&#13;
during the reference period, shows that on average those in urban areas had&#13;
been looking for work longer than those in rural areas. In Java, the poor had&#13;
not spent as long, whereas in the Outer Islands they had spent longer, than&#13;
the equivalent group of the nonpoor. In addition, a larger proportion was&#13;
looking for full-time, as opposed to part-time, jobs. The proportions looking&#13;
for full-time jobs are lowest in rural areas of the Outer Islands and among&#13;
the rural rich in Java.&#13;
In general, a higher proportion of the nonpoor were supported by&#13;
their families or friends while they were looking for work, with the exception&#13;
of rural Java; the poor were more likely to have worked than the nonpoor&#13;
during their job search. Finally, among those looking for work, the poor were&#13;
more likely than the nonpoor to have ever worked before, with the exception of&#13;
those in rural areas of the Outer Islands.&#13;
III.4    Those Engaged Only in Nonmarket Activities&#13;
Table 3.5 looks at those who were performing only nonmarket&#13;
activities, that is they did not have a job and did not look for work during&#13;
the reference week. It shows that only a very small percentage of these had&#13;
looked for work during the three-month period preceding the survey. Most of&#13;
them gave as their main reason for not looking for work the fact that they&#13;
were taking care of the house or attending school; a higher proportion of the&#13;
poor were taking care of the house, while a higher proportion of the better-&#13;
off were attending school. With the exception of rural areas of the Outer&#13;
Islands, a greater proportion of the poor said that they would accept a job if&#13;
one were available.&#13;

IV.      Households and their Sources of Income&#13;
In this section we look into the economic activities of Indonesian&#13;
households, the focus being on how households make a living and the relative&#13;
well-being of different groups. We first look at sources of income for&#13;
households in general and then focus especially on agricultural households.&#13;
IV.1     Sources of Household Income&#13;
Table 4.1 gives a distribution of households by their major source&#13;
of income, with a breakdown into urban and rural areas of Java and the Outer&#13;
Islands. As would be expected, urban households rely more on nonagricultural&#13;
sources of income, while rural households depend more on agricultural&#13;
sources. However, it is worth noting that, for 8% of households in urban Java&#13;
and 15% of urban households in the Outer Islands, agriculture is the main&#13;
source of income. On the other side, 30% of households in rural Java and 22%&#13;
of those in rural areas of the Outer Islands do not have agriculture as their&#13;
main income source. The major nonagricultural sectors in rural areas are&#13;
sales, industry and handicrafts, services and government. In urban areas, the&#13;
two major sectors are sales and government.&#13;
Table 4.1 also gives the percentages of households with&#13;
supplementary income from various sectors. Although all sectors play some&#13;
part in providing households with incomes in addition to their primary&#13;
sources, the two which are especially important in urban areas are sales and&#13;
services. For example, in urban Java 12% of households have supplementary&#13;
income from sales activities and 14% of them do so from service activities.&#13;
In rural Java 13% of households supplement their primary source of income with&#13;
agricultural activities, while 6% of rural households in the Outer Islands do&#13;
so. Thus 83% of rural households in Java and 84% of those in the Outer&#13;
&#13;

Islands rely to some extent on agriculture as a source of income.    Other&#13;
sectors which are important sources of supplementary income in the rural areas&#13;
are sales, industry and handicrafts, and services. The vast majority of all&#13;
households have some transfer income.&#13;
IV.2     Poor Households and Sources of Income&#13;
Table 4.2 gives the incidence of poverty for households by sector of&#13;
their main source of income. Within each sector, households are further&#13;
divided into three groups according to whether they have-only workers in the&#13;
sector, own account workers, or both.&#13;
The incidence of poor households varies considerably depending on&#13;
their primary source of income. In both urban and rural areas of Java and the&#13;
Outer Islands, agricultural households are among the worst off, in the sense&#13;
of having the highest proportions of poor households in urban areas and nearly&#13;
the highest in rural areas. It is interesting that in rural Java, the 4.5% of&#13;
households which depend on industry and handicrafts have a larger proportion&#13;
of poor households than the agricultural households; in rural areas of the&#13;
Outer Islands, the industry and handicrafts households have a higher&#13;
proportion, while households relying on transportation have nearly the same&#13;
proportion, of poor households compared with agricultural households.&#13;
Households relying on the government sector are considerably better&#13;
off than the rest in all regions. Those engaged in sales activities also have&#13;
a relatively low proportion of poor households.&#13;

The breakdown within each sector shows that, with some exceptions,&#13;
worker households have a higher proportion of poor households than own-account&#13;
worker households. In rural Java, 59% of worker households in agriculture are&#13;
poor compared with 47% of own account worker households. The figures are 32%&#13;
and 22% for the Outer Islands.&#13;
In industry and handicrafts a different picture can be seen. With&#13;
the exception of urban households in the Outer Islands, own-account worker&#13;
households in this sector are worse-off than the worker households. This&#13;
likely reflects the low returns to cottage industry activities compared with&#13;
wage incomes from industry. In the Outer Islands we also find that own-&#13;
account worker households in transportation and services have higher&#13;
incidences of poor households than worker households.&#13;
IV.3     Rural Households and Nonagricultural Sources of Income&#13;
We have pointed out that there are many rural households, 30% in&#13;
Java and 22% in the Outer Islands, which do not rely on agriculture as their&#13;
primary sources of income. Moreover, nonagricultural activities provide&#13;
supplementary income to a significant proportion of rural households.&#13;
Here we examine further the extent to which agricultural households,&#13;
those which rely primarily on agriculture, also have nonagricultural sources&#13;
of income. Table 4.3 gives the percentages of agricultural households with&#13;
incomes from different sectors. We see that by far the most important&#13;
secondary activity for agricultural households is working on own-account in&#13;
sales. Service workers and own-account workers in industry and handicrafts&#13;
also account for a sizeable share of nonagricultural activities. Ignoring&#13;
transfer incomes, which accrue to nearly all households, and even recognizing&#13;
that some agricultural households may be engaged in more than one&#13;
&#13;

nonagricultural activity, probably one-third of agricultural households in&#13;
both urban areas and in rural Java and one-fifth of those in rural areas of&#13;
the Outer Islands have supplementary incomes from a nonagricultural source.&#13;
We attempt to link the degree to which rural households rely on&#13;
nonagricultural income sources to the adequacy of their landholding. We&#13;
postulate that, in spite of the fact that households with inadequate land to&#13;
meet their consumption needs can obtain employment as paid farm workers, on&#13;
average there should be a negative relationship between reliance on&#13;
nonagricultural activities and adequacy of landholding.&#13;
Ignoring the problems of varying qualities of land, the income which&#13;
can be derived from land will be positively related to the size of that&#13;
land. How adequate that income is to the households will depend on its size&#13;
and composition. Thus a simple characterization would be that the adequacy of&#13;
farm income to a household is positively related to the land area which it&#13;
controls and negatively related to the household size.&#13;
Table 4.4 gives the-proportion of all rural households which are&#13;
engaged in any nonagricultural activities whatsoever; the households are&#13;
classified by the size of landholding and household size, as well as major&#13;
region.&#13;
For each class of landholding and for all classes combined, the&#13;
proportion of households depending to some measure on nonagricultural&#13;
activities increases with household size. For example in rural Java among&#13;
households with less than half a hectare of land, 32% of those with 1-2&#13;
members have some nonagricultural activity, while 68% of those with more than&#13;
ten members do so.&#13;

On the other side, for a given household size, as well as for all&#13;
sizes combined, the proportion of households with nonagricultural activities&#13;
is inversely related to the size of landholding. For example, for households&#13;
with 5-6 members in rural Java, 75% of those which are landless have nonagri-&#13;
cultural activities, while 50% of those with less than half a hectare and 37%&#13;
of those with more than one hectare do so.&#13;
Excluding landless households, the proportion depending on nonagri-&#13;
culture for part of their income is lower in the Outer Islands for the same&#13;
household size and class of landholding.&#13;
Thus rural households are more likely to be engaged in nonagri-&#13;
cultural activities if their landholding is inadequate in relation to their&#13;
household size.&#13;
IV.4     Agricultural Households&#13;
In this section we concentrate exclusively on agricultural&#13;
households, those for whom agriculture is the main source of income, and&#13;
compare some of the characteristics of poor. and nonpoor households.&#13;
Agricultural households form the majority of rural households; they&#13;
constitute an even larger proportion of the poor households, 74% in rural Java&#13;
and 84% in rural areas of the Outer Islands. Agricultural households can be&#13;
divided into three groups: those of farm operators, those of farm operators&#13;
in which other household members also work on the farm, and those of farm&#13;
workers. The last group consists of households which depend mainly on&#13;
agriculture for their livelihood but have no land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
In Table 4.5 we give a comparison of poor, better-off and rich&#13;
agricultural households with respect to their landholdings, with the&#13;
households classified into groups-as above. Within any region, farm worker&#13;
households make up a larger percentage while farm operator households form a&#13;
smaller percentage of poor households than the nonpoor ones.&#13;
The table also gives the proportion of each type of household, with&#13;
the exception of households of farm workers, which have different types of&#13;
landholding: land owned; land owned but transferred to another party through&#13;
a production sharing agreement or other arrangement; and land received from&#13;
another party through a production sharing agreement or other arrangement.&#13;
The average size of each type of landholding for all households is also given&#13;
in the table.&#13;
A smaller proportion of poor households work on their own land&#13;
compared with nonpoor households, even among the two groups of households of&#13;
farm operators. The exceptions are farm operator households in urban Java and&#13;
households of farm operators and workers in urban areas of the Outer&#13;
Islands. In rural Java, fewer of poor farm operator households rent in land,&#13;
while in both rural areas more poor households of farm operators and workers&#13;
rent in land.&#13;
Taking all agricultural households as a group, we find that in most&#13;
cases land owned by the households forms the major part of the land operated&#13;
on. The total area of land controlled by households is smaller for poor&#13;
households than nonpoor ones in all the regions. For example, in rural Java&#13;
poor farm operator households control just over half a hectare, while better-&#13;
off farm operator households control over three-quarters of one hectare and&#13;
rich ones nearly one hectare. As a rule, total holding sizes are smaller in&#13;
Java than in the Outer Islands when we compare similar types of households.&#13;

Thus, as would have been expected, control over land can be linked&#13;
to the income levels of households. Those households dependent on agriculture&#13;
but without land are more likely to be found among poor households. Among&#13;
farm operator households, whether with other household members working on the&#13;
farm or without, poor households control smaller holdings than nonpoor ones.&#13;
Table 4.6 gives the proportions of agricultural households which are&#13;
engaged in different types of activities: growing seasonal crops, annual&#13;
crops, livestock, fisheries and hunting. Concentrating on rural households,&#13;
the single most important difference between poor and nonpoor households is&#13;
the fact that a larger proportion of nonpoor households grow annual crops.&#13;
Likewise, when we look at the distribution of agricultural income for each&#13;
household type by source we see that seasonal crops constitute a larger&#13;
proportion, and annual crops a smaller proportion, of the total agricultural&#13;
income of poor households compared with nonpoor ones.&#13;

V.       Consumption Patterns&#13;
In this section we compare the consumption patterns of poor, better-&#13;
off and rich households in urban and rural areas of Java and the Outer&#13;
Islands. We expect one of the manifestations of poverty to be that the poor&#13;
spend more on essentials while the nonpoor can spend more on luxuries, or less&#13;
essential items of consumption.&#13;
V.1      Distribution of Consumption Expenditures by Major Categories&#13;
Table 5.1 gives the shares of the major categories of consumption&#13;
expenditures in the total. When we compare the poor, better-off and rich&#13;
within a region we see that a higher proportion of the budget of the poor goes&#13;
into the one item which is the most essential for their survival, namely&#13;
food. They typically spend smaller proportions on nonfood categories, for&#13;
example, clothing, housing and so on, the exception being that the poor in&#13;
rural areas on both Java and the Outer Islands spend a larger share of total&#13;
expenditures on housing and fuel than the nonpoor. To use rural Java as an&#13;
example, the poor spend 73% of their total expenditures on food, compared with&#13;
44% for the rich. They spend 4% on clothing compared with 8%, and .7% on&#13;
durable goods compared with 16%. The pattern is similar for all regions.&#13;
The poor in urban areas spend a slightly higher or the same&#13;
proportion of their budget on expenditures related to schooling; in rural&#13;
areas they spend a smaller proportion. With respect to expenditures related&#13;
to health, the poor clearly spend a smaller proportion of their budget than&#13;
the better-off and the rich on such items.&#13;

V.2      Distribution of Food Expenditures&#13;
Table 5.2 gives a distribution of total food expeditures by major&#13;
food categories for households by region. We see that the poor in all regions&#13;
spend around 53% of their food expenditures on paddy and paddy byproducts,&#13;
compared with the rich who spend between 20-30%. The poor also spend a larger&#13;
proportion on tubers, which consist in this case primarily of cassava.&#13;
Altogether, 53% of all households reportedly consume tubers and their&#13;
byproducts. In Java they also spend a slightly larger proportion on&#13;
vegetables than the nonpoor. Otherwise, the nonpoor are able to spend a&#13;
larger share of their food budget on such items as fish, meat, eggs, milk and&#13;
fruits. They spend relatively more on other consumables and roughly twice as&#13;
much on prepared foods. It is thus clear that being poor translates itself&#13;
into quite a different pattern of food consumption: the major share goes into&#13;
the consumption of carbohydrates, namely paddy, cassava and their byproducts,&#13;
and consequently leaving relatively much smaller shares for sources of protein&#13;
like fish, meat and eggs. The nutritional contents of foods consumed by the&#13;
poor and the nonpoor are therefore quite dissimilar. It is worth noting that,&#13;
whereas 83% of all households report expenditures on fish and 98% report&#13;
expenditures on vegetables, the proportion of households which report&#13;
expenditures on meat is only 20% and that on eggs and milk is only 36%.&#13;

VI.      Housing Conditions&#13;
In this section we give a comparison of some of the housing&#13;
characteristics of poor, better-off and rich households. This is of interest&#13;
for two reasons. One is that it gives some meaning to the notion of being&#13;
poor besides the tautological description that the poor have less money than&#13;
the rich. Another is that it gives us an idea of how much the poor are able&#13;
to make use of public services compared with better-off households.&#13;
VI.1     Housing Structure&#13;
Table 6.1 compares the housing structure of poor, better-off and&#13;
rich households by location and major region. The results are as would be&#13;
expected. The poor have less floor space and fewer rooms than the nonpoor.&#13;
They are more likely to use bamboo rather than masonry or wood for the walls&#13;
of their houses. Their floors are more likely to be made of earth, while&#13;
those of better-off households have higher proportions made out of tiles or&#13;
concrete in Java, and of concrete or wood in the Outer Islands. It is&#13;
interesting to note that 62% of poor households in urban Java have earthen&#13;
floors in their houses, compared with 14% for the rich households. As far as&#13;
roofing material goes, tiles are widely used in Java, especially in urban&#13;
areas, and there is not a pronounced difference between poor and nonpoor&#13;
households. In the Outer Islands, however, the poorer households are more&#13;
likely to use thatch as roofing material.&#13;

VI.2     Housing Facilities&#13;
Table 6.2 compares housing facilities of households. As would be&#13;
expected, poorer households are less likely to use electricity or pump&#13;
lanterns for illumination and more likely to use oil lamps; over 90% of all&#13;
rural households rely on oil lamps. For cooking, hardly any households at all&#13;
use electricity or gas; more of the better-off ones use kerosene, while more&#13;
of the poorer ones use firewood, this being the most common fuel for cooking&#13;
in rural areas of both Java and the Outer Islands.&#13;
Poor households are less likely to have piped water for drinking&#13;
than nonpoor ones. Their major drinking-water supply is the bucket well,&#13;
which is also widely used by better-off households. The poor are also more&#13;
likely to avail themselves of springs and rivers as a source of drinking&#13;
water. In addition, a smaller proportion of poor households boil their water&#13;
before drinking it compared with nonpoor households. Over 90% of households&#13;
in all regions, poor or otherwise, boil water for drinking. The exception is&#13;
poor households in rural areas of the Outer Islands; only 80% of them do so.&#13;
Poor households are not so likely to have a toilet on the&#13;
premises. The difference between poor and nonpoor households in this respect&#13;
is more marked in urban areas. They are less likely to dispose of their trash&#13;
in trash cans or by burning, the exception to the latter being urban Java, and&#13;
more likely to use more primitive methods like burying the trash.&#13;

VI.3     Access to Mass Media&#13;
Finally, Table 6.3 gives the proportions of households which have&#13;
radios, which have television sets and which receive a newspaper or a magazine&#13;
on a regular basis. Very sharp differences can be seen between poor, better-&#13;
off and rich households.&#13;
More urban households have radios than rural ones and poor&#13;
households are less likely to have them than nonpoor ones. The poor hardly&#13;
ever have a television set; neither do they receive a newspaper or magazine on&#13;
a regular basis. Both the television and newspaper seem to be largely urban&#13;
phenomena.&#13;

VII.     Schooling and Health&#13;
The SUSENAS 1978 data contain some information related to schooling&#13;
and health which will be used in this section to compare the situation for&#13;
households at different levels of per capita consumption.&#13;
VII.1    School Enrollment&#13;
Table 7.1 gives the school enrollment rate, the proportion attending&#13;
school, for boys and girls of different age groups belonging to poor, better-&#13;
off and rich households for the different regions of Indonesia. The age&#13;
groups are chosen so as to correspond to the appropriate age groups for&#13;
different levels of schooling: 7 to 12 for primary school; 13 to 15 for lower&#13;
secondary school; and 16 to 18 for upper secondary school.&#13;
In the primary school age group, school attendance is close to&#13;
complete. This applies to rural as well as urban areas, Java as well as the&#13;
Outer Islands, girls as well as boys and, most significantly, children from&#13;
poor as well as nonpoor households. Thus the school system had succeeded by&#13;
1978 in enrolling most children in primary schools.&#13;
The differences between areas, sexes and economic status become more&#13;
pronounced when we consider enrollment in secondary school since enrollment&#13;
rates quickly drop off as we consider higher levels of schooling. For&#13;
example, among children of poor households in rural Java, 92% in the 7-12 age&#13;
group are enrolled in school, compared with 42% in the 13-15 and 12% in the&#13;
16-18 age groups. Enrollment at the secondary level is higher in urban than&#13;
in rural areas, as would be expected. It is higher in the Outer Islands than&#13;
in Java when comparable groups are considered, with the exception of children&#13;
aged 16 to 18 in poor urban households where the rate is much higher in Java.&#13;

After controlling for region and economic status, boys of each age&#13;
group are more likely to be enrolled in secondary school than girls,&#13;
indicating the preferences of parents which favor schooling for sons over that&#13;
for daughters.&#13;
Economic status and school enrollment are clearly related. Children&#13;
from poor households of a certain sex, age group and region have a lower&#13;
chance of being in secondary school than comparable ones from better-off and&#13;
rich households. The differentials are even more pronounced at the upper&#13;
secondary level than at the lower secondary level.&#13;
VII.2    Educational Attainment&#13;
In Table 7.2 we look at the level of educational attainment of the&#13;
population aged fifteen and over. As would be expected, levels of schooling&#13;
completed are generally higher in urban areas and among males compared with&#13;
females. Nevertheless, they are quite low as a rule. In rural areas, even&#13;
among rich households 48% of males and 68% of females in Java, and 47% of&#13;
males and 57% of females in the Outer Islands have not attended school or have&#13;
not completed primary school. In rural areas, only a small proportion of&#13;
males and hardly any females have gone beyond primary school.&#13;
Those in poor households have a lower level of educational attain-&#13;
ment in all regions. Over half of women in poor rural households have never&#13;
attended school at all. The chances of having more than a primary education&#13;
are very small indeed for members of poor households.&#13;

Table 7.3 gives the main reasons given for leaving school for the&#13;
under-30 population who are not enrolled in school. Some interesting&#13;
differences can be seen between those who belong to poor and nonpoor&#13;
households.&#13;
The nonpoor are more likely than the poor to leave school because&#13;
they have had sufficient schooling, with the exception of urban Java.&#13;
However, a higher proportion of the poor give lack of funds as the reason for&#13;
leaving school in general. It is significant that only a small proportion of&#13;
the people asked give as their reason for leaving school the fact that the&#13;
school was too far away or no school was available. Moreover, the poor do not&#13;
necessarily give this answer more often than the nonpoor. However, this&#13;
proportion is higher in the rural areas of the Outer Islands than elsewhere.&#13;
Given that the population is less dense and more scattered in these areas it&#13;
would seem plausible that the lack of school or the great distances to them&#13;
could be more of a deterrent to school attendance there than elsewhere in&#13;
Indonesia.&#13;
VII.3    Health Services&#13;
We compare here the use of health facilities of poor, better-off and&#13;
rich households for three sets of individuals: currently pregnant women;&#13;
women who had given birth during the year preceding the survey; and people who&#13;
had been sick during the week preceding the survey.&#13;
Table 7.4 gives the proportion of households having pregnant women&#13;
at the time of the survey. Each pregnant woman was asked whether she had had&#13;
an examination. For both urban and rural areas of Java and the Outer Islands,&#13;
a smaller proportion of pregnant women in poor households have had an&#13;
examination of any description. Those in urban households are also more&#13;
likely to have been examined than their rural counterparts.&#13;

The data on the place where the examination took place show some&#13;
differences between Java and the Outer Islands. In Java a greater proportion&#13;
of women in poor urban households have had their examination at home; in the&#13;
Outer Islands it is the nonpoor women who have done so. A greater percentage&#13;
of poor women in Java are examined at a folk doctor's residence or at a public&#13;
health center or subcenter; while a smaller percentage do so at the office of&#13;
a physician, midwife or paramedic. None goes to a general hospital and in&#13;
urban areas they do not go to a maternity hospital or clinic; in rural areas,&#13;
however, a larger percentage of them go to a maternity hospital or clinic&#13;
compared with nonpoor women. What is striking about rural Java is that as&#13;
many as three-quarters of the poor women have been examined at the office of a&#13;
physician, midwife or paramedic, a public health center or subcenter, or a&#13;
maternity hospital or clinic.&#13;
In the Outer Islands, a larger proportion of poor women have been&#13;
examined at home or at the office of a doctor, midwife or paramedic; a smaller&#13;
proportion of them have gone to a folk doctor's residence in rural areas and&#13;
none in urban areas. All the women who had gone to a public health center or&#13;
subcenter, a maternity hospital or clinic, or a general hospital were from&#13;
nonpoor households.&#13;
The data showing who did the examination clarifies the situation&#13;
further. Only women from the nonpoor households have had their examination&#13;
done by a physician; a greater proportion from urban households among these&#13;
have seen a doctor compared with rural households. Most women in general,&#13;
however, and all of the poor women, have been examined by either a folk doctor&#13;
or a midwife or paramedic. The poor make more use of the folk doctor and less&#13;
of the midwife or paramedic compared with the nonpoor. The notable exception&#13;
is again rural Java, where over two-thirds of both poor and nonpoor women have&#13;
been examined by a midwife or paramedic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Table 7.4 also presents information concerning women who had given&#13;
birth during the year preceding the survey. Only a small proportion of women&#13;
had a physician assisting at birth and hardly any of the poor, except for 1%&#13;
of those in rural Java and 2% in the rural areas of the Outer Islands. Most&#13;
people had either a folk doctor or a midwife or paramedic, again with the poor&#13;
making more use of folk doctors and less of midwives or paramedics compared&#13;
with the nonpoor. The proportion using a folk doctor at birth is consistently&#13;
larger than that of pregnant women using one in the examination. Similarly,&#13;
the proportions using a physician or using a midwife or paramedic at birth are&#13;
lower than those used in the examination of pregnant women. Only in the Outer&#13;
Islands, especially among the poor in rural areas, does one find no one in&#13;
attendance at birth outside the family.&#13;
Table 7.5 gives a comparison of households in terms of their&#13;
proportions in the total reporting a member having been ill during the&#13;
preceding week; the average number of days they have been ill, as well as the&#13;
average number of days they have been in bed; where and by whom they have been&#13;
treated; and the average distance and time taken to reach the person giving&#13;
treatment.&#13;
A smaller proportion of poor households in each of the major regions&#13;
reported having a member who was ill during the week preceding the survey.&#13;
This is quite a common finding and is not surprising since it reflects the&#13;
subjective nature of the response; poor people are less likely to classify&#13;
themselves as ill compared with better-off and rich individuals.&#13;
With the exception of urban Java, of the people who reported&#13;
themselves as ill during the preceding week the ones from poor households on&#13;
average had been ill longer. The pattern for the average number of days spent&#13;
in bed is not very clear.&#13;

The poor are more likely to have been treated for their illness at&#13;
home or at a folk doctor's residence. In urban areas a larger proportion of&#13;
them go to a public health center, whereas in rural areas more of the nonpoor&#13;
do so. The poor are less likely to be treated at a physician's office, the&#13;
exception being rural Java, and a smaller percentage of them go to a hospital.&#13;
Consistent with the above is the observation that poor people are&#13;
more likely to be treated for their illness by themselves, other family&#13;
members, fclk doctors, midwives or paramedics; the nonpoor are far more likely&#13;
to be treated by a physician.&#13;
Within each region the poor generally take less time and travel&#13;
shorter distances to receive treatment than the nonpoor.&#13;
The information provided by the SUSENAS 1978 gives us only a&#13;
cursory, far from exhaustive, comparison of the treatment of health problems&#13;
for poor, better-off and rich households. The differential extents to which&#13;
the poor and nonpoor use physicians compared with less-qualified personnel,&#13;
such as folk doctors, are nevertheless clearly brought out in the data&#13;
pertaining to pregnant women, women who have given birth and people reporting&#13;
being ill.&#13;

Summary and Conclusion&#13;
This paper uses data from the National Socio-economic Survey for&#13;
1978 (SUSENAS 1978) to give a profile of poverty in Indonesia. Households are&#13;
classified into the poor, better-off and rich categories according to their&#13;
levels of per capita consumption, with a breakdown into urban and rural areas&#13;
of Java and the Outer Islands. Poor, better-off and rich households are then&#13;
compared in terms of their characteristics; these can be divided into those&#13;
associated with the causes and those associated with the consequences of&#13;
poverty.&#13;
With regard to factors associated with the causes of poverty, the&#13;
paper shows that the poor are at a disadvantage from a demographic standpoint:&#13;
they have larger families and, more importantly, relatively more children and&#13;
hence higher dependency ratios. Their heads of households have less&#13;
education, as do their households members. More of their members are in the&#13;
labor force and they work longer hours. Yet they change jobs more frequently&#13;
and more of those already working are prepared to accept additional jobs while&#13;
more of those who are not working are willing to accept a suitable job. The&#13;
poor are more likely to rely on agriculture as their main source of income.&#13;
In rural areas, households are more likely to be engaged in nonagricultural&#13;
activities the less adequate is the size of their landholding given their&#13;
household size.&#13;
With respect to factors associated with the consequences of poverty,&#13;
the poor are found to spend a much larger share of their total budget on food&#13;
and correspondingly smaller shares on other categories of consumption. Within&#13;
the food category they spend the greater part of the budget on carbohydrates,&#13;
namely paddy, cassava and their byproducts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The living conditions of the poor are clearly inferior in terms of&#13;
their housing structure and amenities, such as availability of water and&#13;
electricity. The poor are less likely to own radios and televisions or to&#13;
receive newspapers and magazines on a regular basis.&#13;
A smaller proportion of the children of the poor attend school&#13;
beyond the lower primary level. The poor do not receive health care of as&#13;
good a quality as the nonpoor: they are less likely to use physicians and&#13;
rely more on less-qualified health personnel, such as folk doctors.&#13;
We thus find that great differences can be found in the way that the&#13;
poor and the nonpoor live. There are factors which suggest why the poor do&#13;
not attain levels of income which are as high as the nonpoor. There are also&#13;
clear manifestations on the consumption side of what it means to be poor.&#13;
The paper is intended to serve merely as a descriptive backdrop of&#13;
the lives of Indonesians whom we are studying. Subsequent work will deal with&#13;
the individual topics in this paper in greater detail, with a view of reaching&#13;
a better understanding of the causes and consequences of poverty in Indonesia.&#13;

            Poverty in Indonesia : a profile
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Data from the National Socio-economic
            Survey for 1978 are used to give a profile of poverty in
            Indonesia. Households are classified into the poor and
            nonpoor categories according to their levels of per capita
            consumption, with a breakdown into urban and rural areas of
            Java and the Outer Islands. Poor and nonpoor households are
            then compared in terms of their geographical distribution,
            demographic characteristics, economic and noneconomic
            activities of individuals, sources of household income,
            consumption patterns, housing conditions, and schooling and health.
