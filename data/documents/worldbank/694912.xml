INDIA&#13;
RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:          India, acting by its President&#13;
Beneficiaries:     Govemments of Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Kamataka, Madhya Pradesh and&#13;
Uttar Pradesh.&#13;
Amount:            IDA SDR 13,500,000 (US$19.5 million equivalent)&#13;
IFAD SDR 13,300,000 (US$19.2 million equivalent)&#13;
Poverty:           Program of Targeted Interventions (PTI). The project is classified as a PTI&#13;
because the beneficiaries would be women below the poverty line in rural&#13;
areas.&#13;
Terms:             Standard Intemational Development Association (IDA) terms with 35&#13;
years to maturity.&#13;
On-Lending Terms: As a Centrally-sponsored project, the proceeds of the IDA Credit/IFAD&#13;
Loan would be available to the states of Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana,&#13;
Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh as a grant. GOI would&#13;
assume the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
Description:       The proposed multi-state investment operation would be implemented over&#13;
a five year period in a phased manner. It would commence a long-term&#13;
process to improve women's economic and social status. The scope and&#13;
coverage of the project in the participating states would be govemed by the&#13;
relative success of the main intervenors in establishing and sustaining self-&#13;
reliant Self Help Groups (SHGs). The project design allows flexibility to&#13;
introduce changes based on implementation experience. The project would&#13;
pursue its objectives through the following components:&#13;
(a) Institutional Capacity Building for Women's Development including:&#13;
(i) establishment of self-reliant women's groups through support to NGOs&#13;
to establish woman's SHGs based on savings and credit; building capacity&#13;
of new and existing SHGs through training and awareness raising; and&#13;
assistance to SHGs to establish a track record of sound credit management&#13;
to make them attractive clients to the lending institutions. The project&#13;
would strengthen the capacity of support agencies, e.g., WDCs, NGOs,&#13;
financial institutions and line departments to provide better service to poor&#13;
women and sensitize them to gender issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
agencies, e.g., WDCs, NGOs, financial institutions and line departments to&#13;
provide better service to poor women and sensitize them to gender issues.&#13;
(b) Establish Support Mechanisms for Women Managed Income&#13;
GeneratingActivities. The project would assist SHGs to access group&#13;
loans from lending institutions for investments in income generating&#13;
activities, both on-farm and non-farm, following demonstration of&#13;
capacity for credit management based on the group's own savings. In&#13;
addition, it would provide support for skill training, technology transfer,&#13;
technical support and promotion of market linkages.&#13;
(c) Establish Mechanisms to Access Social Programs and Leverage&#13;
Funds for Community Assets Creation. To improve the quality of&#13;
women's lives and release time for productive purposes, the project would&#13;
assist in improving women's access to social services such as health and&#13;
child care and creating or improving community assets such as drinking&#13;
water and multipurpose meeting halls by leveraging contributions from&#13;
on-going government programs or the community. Priorities for such&#13;
investments would be decided in consultation with the communities.&#13;
(d) Provide Effective Project Management Systems. Strengthen capacity&#13;
of central and state level agencies to manage the project based on&#13;
implementation experience and feedback provided by the concurrent&#13;
monitoring and evaluation system to be established under the project.&#13;
Benefits:         Immediate benefits would flow from: (a) creation of women's self-help&#13;
groups and their ability to control income and their own development; (b)&#13;
enhanced involvement of women in income generating activities through&#13;
access to funds from their own savings and integration of women into the&#13;
mainstream delivery mechanisms for credit; (c) improved management&#13;
and technical skills for income generating activities; (d) improvements in&#13;
women's health and reduction in their drudgery; and (e) strengthening of&#13;
key support agencies (NGOs, WDCs, financial institutions, line&#13;
departments) enabling them to be more effective in addressing women's&#13;
needs. Longer term benefits for women would include: (i) increased self-&#13;
reliance and self-confidence to address the constraints faced by them and&#13;
increased ability to mobilize various public and private sector services for&#13;
their benefit; and (ii) improvement in their social status in the family and&#13;
community. It is estimated that the project would assist in the formation&#13;
of about 7,400 groups benefiting about 130,000 women.&#13;
Risks:            The proposed project carries several risks. Some are general problems&#13;
associated with implementation of projects in India including late start-up,&#13;
frequent management turnover and weak implementation capacity. Most of&#13;
these risks have been substantially reduced through project design, which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
emphasizes organizational capacity building, recruitment of contractual staff&#13;
on a longterm basis at the management level, and early recruitment of key&#13;
staff to facilitate project start-up. In addition, hiring of NGOs, formation of a&#13;
small number of SHGs, and orientation and training of project implementors&#13;
have been launched prior to project effectiveness using PPF advance and&#13;
retroactive financing facilities. These actions would expedite project&#13;
implementation and generate valuable experience.&#13;
There are other risks specifically associated with the project. First, an&#13;
adequate number of competent NGOs may not be found to form and support&#13;
SHGs, and this may result in an overload on the limited number of&#13;
experienced NGOs. To address this, the project would support capacity&#13;
building of motivated NGOs who presently lack experience of SHG&#13;
formation, encouraging them to participate in the project. In addition,&#13;
transparent contractual arrangements specifying roles and responsibilities of&#13;
public institutions, NGOs and SHGs, with appropriate funding, have been&#13;
developed in consultations between the WDCs and partner NGOs to provide&#13;
a supportive environment for project implementation. In the later years of&#13;
the project mature SHGs would be encouraged to take over some of the&#13;
functions initially performed by NGOs.&#13;
Second, the WDCs may not develop adequate capacity to effectively&#13;
coordinate project activities. Institutional strengthening of the WlDCs&#13;
through staffing with relevant expertise would be emphasized in the project&#13;
to mitigate this risk. In addition, phased implementation of the project&#13;
would ensure that adequate training is provided to staff before project&#13;
coverage is expanded. Feedback from the concurrent M&amp;E system would&#13;
indicate the readiness of the WDCs to cope with an expanded area of&#13;
operation.&#13;
Third, insufficient attention may be provided by the technical line&#13;
departments in support of income generating activities, especially on-farm,&#13;
and in provision of social services. The project addresses this risk through&#13;
the training of staff of support agencies, including gender sensitization, and&#13;
through the strengthening of linkages between key project implementors&#13;
(WDCs, NGOs) and line departments to effectively respond to women's&#13;
needs. Funds are also available to tap other private sources of technical&#13;
support, especially for non-farm activities, where deficiencies are&#13;
anticipated. An associated risk is the limited capacity within some states to&#13;
support micro-enterprises. To address this, the project would finance&#13;
support from successful private sector women entrepreneurs to help in&#13;
identification and capacity building of local entrepreneurs willing to assist&#13;
SHG members in establishing new enterprises of their choice and/or&#13;
developing market linkages for businesses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iv&#13;
A fourth risk is that banks may not be as responsive as envisaged in&#13;
providing loans to the groups. The project seeks to reduce this risk by&#13;
enhancing the expertise of the groups in credit finance management based&#13;
on internal savings. This would help to develop a sound credit history thus&#13;
making the groups attractive clients for the lending institutions.&#13;
Furthermore, infornation, motivation and sensitization workshops would be&#13;
held for participating bankers to convey, among others, the message that&#13;
lending to SHGs reduces the transaction costs of banks compared to direct&#13;
lending to individuals.&#13;
A final risk is that the women may not be able to generate additional income&#13;
because of difficulties in overcoming time and labor constraints. To address&#13;
this, the project provides support for activities to reduce drudgery and&#13;
improve access to social services, especially health and child care facilities.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
I. WOMEN AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
A. Country Profile&#13;
1.01        With an area of 3.39 million square kilometers and a population of 846 million&#13;
(1991 Census), India is the seventh largest country in the world and the second most populous.&#13;
Although India has made substantial progress in improving living conditions, the rate of&#13;
economic growth has been modest until recently and its impact has been diluted by the increase&#13;
in population which continues to grow at about 2.1 percent per year. As a result, widespread&#13;
poverty remains a dominant feature of India's socio-economic condition, with around 30-40&#13;
percent of the Indian population (230-320 million) living below the poverty line, and a per capita&#13;
GDP of US$330 (1991).&#13;
1.02        Key changes following liberalization have included an increase in the rate of&#13;
growth and a modified structure of the economy. The faster growth of the services and&#13;
manufacturing sectors has resulted in a decline in the contribution of agriculture to about 30&#13;
percent of GDP, and an increase in the importance of services and industry, which now account&#13;
for 41 percent and 29 percent of GDP, respectively. Although declining in its contribution to&#13;
GDP, agriculture remains a key economic activity, providing a livelihood for over 64 percent of&#13;
the population.&#13;
B. Status of Women&#13;
1.03        Over the last quarter of a century, improved household food security, an expanding&#13;
health care system, and maternal and child health interventions have brought about significant gains&#13;
in women's health status. The life expectancy at birth for females has risen from about 32 years in&#13;
1951 to about 60 years in 1991. The differential between the female and male infant mortality rates&#13;
(IMR) has been bridged, with a male IMR of 81 and a female IMR of 80 per 1,000 live births. The&#13;
maternal mortality ratio is about 440 per 100,000 live births. The girl child has become the focus of&#13;
the universal primary education campaign and, in 1993-94, 71.4 percent of girls of primary school&#13;
age were enrolled in primary school.&#13;
1.04        However, gender analysis of most social and economic indicators demonstrates that&#13;
women in India continue to be relatively disadvantaged in matters of survival, health, nutrition,&#13;
literacy and productivity. India is one of the few countries where males significantly outnumber&#13;
females: according to the 1991 Census, the sex ratio was 927 females to every 1,000 males. From&#13;
birth women are discriminated against in terms of access to the basic necessities of life -&#13;
nutrition, health care and education. While female morbidity rates are in excess of those among&#13;
males, fewer women than men use health services. The disparity between male and female&#13;
literacy is vast. In 1991, 39 percent of women over the age of seven years were literate,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
compared with 64 percent of men. Of the 324 million illiterates enumerated in the 1991 Census,&#13;
61 percent were women.&#13;
1.05        Women are a vital part of the Indian economy, constituting one-third of the national&#13;
labor force. Although most women are considered "marginal workers", by the definition used in&#13;
national statistics, they are major contributors to the survival of the family. The poorer the family,&#13;
the greater is its dependence on women's income. Indian women contribute a much larger share&#13;
of their earnings to basic family maintenance than do men. Women's earnings have an&#13;
immediate positive effect on the incidence and severity of poverty as increases in women's&#13;
income translate into better health and nutrition, particularly for children. Despite this, social&#13;
conventions and gender ideology deprive them of the resources which would enable them to&#13;
increase their economic and social status. More than 90 percent of rural women are unskilled,&#13;
restricting them to low paid occupations. Women generally have no control over land and other&#13;
productive assets, which largely excludes them from access to institutional credit and renders&#13;
them dependent on high cost informal sources of credit to secure capital for self-employment&#13;
activities.&#13;
1.06        Women form the backbone of agriculture, comprising the majority of agricultural&#13;
laborers. Seventy to eighty percent of all field work is done by women, and most post harvest&#13;
and processing tasks are their sole responsibility. Women are also heavily involved in animal&#13;
husbandry, particularly small livestock. They account for 85 percent of persons engaged in dairy&#13;
production. Gender divisions in agriculture are stark with all activities involving manual labor&#13;
assigned to women, whilst all operations involving machinery and draught animals are generally&#13;
performed by men. Female agricultural laborers are among the poorest sections of Indian&#13;
society. Agricultural wages for women are on average 30-50 percent less than those for men.&#13;
1.07        Gender discrimination, the ascription of traditional roles to men and women, and&#13;
gender violence continue to be pervasive problems. Within this broad framework, the situation&#13;
of women varies significantly across regions and according to the socio-economic status of the&#13;
household and its position in the caste hierarchy. Socio-cultural values are more heavily biased&#13;
against women in the north than in the south; amongst caste Hindus than amongst Scheduled&#13;
Tribes or Scheduled Castes; and among land-owning cultivators than among landless laborers&#13;
and marginal farm families.&#13;
C. Policy and Development Approach to Women&#13;
1.08        Since independence, the Government of India's policies for women's development&#13;
have evolved in emphasis, from an initial welfare oriented approach to the current focus on&#13;
economic development and empowerment. Significant changes occurred in the mid-1980s with&#13;
the Seventh Five Year Plan which operationalized the concern for women's equality and&#13;
empowerment, and focused on inculcating confidence among women, generating awareness of&#13;
their rights and privileges, training them for economic activity and employment, and bringing&#13;
them into the mainstream of national development. New structures were created to oversee the&#13;
development of women with the establishment of the Department of Women and Child&#13;
Development (DWCD) within the Ministry of Human Resource Development of the Government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
of India (GOI). Women's Development Corporations (WDCs) were set up in most states to&#13;
implement the new strategy of economic development for women through facilitating access to&#13;
training, entrepreneurship development, credit, technical consultancy services and marketing&#13;
facilities.&#13;
1.09        The Eighth Five Year Plan marked a further shift towards empowerment of&#13;
women, emphasizing women as equal partners and participants in the development process. At&#13;
the national level, GOI has maintained strong advocacy for providing more equitable growth&#13;
opportunities for women. Many sectoral programs include components to address women's needs&#13;
through targeted activities. A prime example of this commitment is the Panchayati Raj Act which&#13;
reserves one-third of seats and chairpersonships of panchayats for women. More recent&#13;
developments include the formulation of a National Policy for Women and emphasis on gender&#13;
equity in programs dealing with poverty.&#13;
1.10        Changes at the national level are paralleled by evolving state government policies&#13;
and plans for women's development. Several states have adopted formal policies for women which&#13;
include: (a) increased participation by women in local decision making processes; (b) an increasing&#13;
focus of poverty alleviation programs on women; (c) mandates to eliminate discrimination against&#13;
girl children and adolescents in matters of food, health, education and child labor; (d) greater spread&#13;
of self-help groups and community based organizations; and (e) recognition of the need to sensitize&#13;
all levels of bureaucracy, legislators, and law enforcement agencies to gender issues. In one of the&#13;
states participating in the project (Kamataka) the government has 'earmarked' 30 percent of the&#13;
funds of certain development programs for expenditure on women, and this is being proposed at the&#13;
national level in the Ninth Five Year Plan (1997-2002).&#13;
1.11        Recently, to meet women's expressed need for improved access to credit, particularly&#13;
to small loans which allow them to engage in risk-averse, multi-production strategies and thereby to&#13;
improve the livelihoods of their families, thrift and credit or "Self-Help Groups" (SHGs) have been&#13;
promoted. These groups initially draw on their own accumulated savings to provide loans to their&#13;
members, and later link with the formal credit system to access funds,overcoming the limitations of&#13;
their own resources. Most SHGs have been promoted by NGOs with more progress being made in the&#13;
south than in the north.&#13;
1.12        Key continuing constraints that impede women's quest for greater economic&#13;
development and social empowerment include: (a) limited institutional capacity of government and&#13;
non-government agencies to address both the social and economic needs of women; (b) target oriented,&#13;
top-down approaches to implementation of development programs with inadequate emphasis on self-&#13;
reliant grassroots organizations such as thrift and credit groups; (c) lack of resources and skills that&#13;
constrain women's abilities to maximize their earnings and contribute to the alleviation of poverty; (d)&#13;
inadequate access to support services, especially health care, education, child care and drudgery&#13;
reducing/time saving technologies; and (e) social inhibitions to equal involvement of women in family&#13;
and community affairs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
D. Institutions Involved in Women's Development&#13;
1.13         At the center, the Department of Women and Child Development (DWCD) in the&#13;
Ministry of Human Resource Development, GOI has the overall mandate for guiding and assisting&#13;
line departments in implementing projects to aid women's development. Within most states, broad&#13;
responsibility for women's issues is similarly vested in the state Department of Women and Child&#13;
Development. In addition, the Women's Development Corporations (WDCs)' have a role in&#13;
enhancing the economic development of women.&#13;
1.14         The WDCs are semi-autonomous government undertakings (mostly registered&#13;
under the Companies Act) established with the specific mandate to assist women to&#13;
developeconomic activities. This mandate provides a broad focus whilst their status as&#13;
Corporations confers independent decision-making powers and greater operational flexibility than a&#13;
government department to work with NGOs and other private sector agencies. However, since&#13;
their establishment, the WDCs have been poorly staffed with the requisite skills in business&#13;
2&#13;
development, and inadequately funded to implement the assigned mandate. The high turnover of&#13;
Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers seconded as Managing Directors has resulted in&#13;
discontinuity of management and a lack of consistency and direction in development approaches.&#13;
As a result, their implementation capacity at present is weak. If these constraints were overcome,&#13;
they could play an important role in advancing women's economic and social development.&#13;
1.15         NGOs also play a significant role in promoting women's economic and social&#13;
development. Many focus on health, education and other social issues, and some assist women to&#13;
gain greater economic independence. A number of NGOs are now supporting the formation of&#13;
women's thrift and credit SHGs, and assisting them to invest in income generating activities.&#13;
1.16         In the formal credit sector, both commercial banks and regional rural banks are&#13;
beginning to feature as lenders to women's groups although more motivational work is required&#13;
to spread awareness of the potential benefits of this strategy. The interest of the banks, however,&#13;
is limited to credit delivery; and it is unlikely that sponsorship of SHGs by banks will provide&#13;
women with the full range of services to derive the wider social benefits of SHG membership.&#13;
The Rashtriya Mahila Kosh (RMK), the national women's credit fund established in 1993, also&#13;
provides credit through NGOs to poor, assetless, self-employed women who are not able to&#13;
access the formal credit system.&#13;
Nomenclature varies between the states. It is Women's Development Corporation in Bihar, Haryana and&#13;
Karnataka; Women's Economic Development Corporation in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh; and Women's&#13;
Welfare Corporation in Uttar Pradesh. The principal exceptions amongst the project states are in Bihar, where&#13;
the WDC is registered under the Societies Registration Act, and Madhya Pradesh, where the WDC is registered&#13;
under the MP Non-Trading Corporation Rules and Act.&#13;
2   In most cases the authorized share capital of the WDCs, which was to be provided by GOI and the state&#13;
government in the ratio 49:51, has not been fully paid up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
1.17         The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)3 has&#13;
undertaken development work to improve the access of neglected sectors/ communities to&#13;
institutional credit. One of the most successful and innovative experiments has been the linking&#13;
of SHGs with banks to provide the rural poor access to the banking system. A pilot project was&#13;
started in 1992 after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed banks to finance informal and&#13;
unregistered groups without collateral and gave liberty to such groups to decide their own terms&#13;
and conditions for financial transactions. This effort was highly successful and covered around&#13;
5,000 groups against the original target of 500. The repayment performance of the the groups&#13;
has been more than 95 percent. Eighty percent of the groups were formed by women.&#13;
Encouraged by the success of the program, RBI has made financing of SHGs by banks a part of&#13;
their mainstream lending operations. A pioneer in this field, NABARD continues to support this&#13;
approach and has accumulated valuable experience in understanding and propagating the concept&#13;
of SHG financing by banks. It has organized a number of training programs, seminars,&#13;
workshops and review meetings, and published literature for the benefit of banks, NGOs and&#13;
women beneficiaries.&#13;
1.18         The main technical line departments covering areas of women's work are:&#13;
Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Horticulture, Sericulture, Rural Development, Industries, the&#13;
Khadi and Village Industries Board and the Khadi and Village Industries Commission. Although&#13;
women should form an equal part of their clientele, these line departments have generally not been&#13;
effective in providing technical support services to women. Various sectoral schemes focused on&#13;
women have been devised to improve the situation, such as the training of women in agriculture,&#13;
but their outreach is limited and there is widespread need to sensitize line department staff to the&#13;
importance and potential of serving women. Women are also inadequately served by social sector&#13;
departments, such as Health and Family Welfare, Education and ICDS due to deficiencies in the&#13;
design and/or provision of services.&#13;
E. Experience with Past Bank Lending&#13;
1.19         Bank Lending. Although the Bank has not invested in a freestanding women's&#13;
development project in India in the past, its projects in the social and agricultural sectors have&#13;
included gender specific activities targeting poor women for additional facilities and services. The&#13;
experience from these projects is varied and extensive enough to provide a number of important&#13;
lessons for the preparation and implementation of this project. In the social sectors, the Bank has&#13;
financed twenty-four projects in the population, health, nutrition and education sub-sectors since&#13;
the 1960s, at a total cost of US$3.4 billion. Areas of support have included: technician education&#13;
and basic/primary education; nutrition and child development; family welfare; control of specific&#13;
diseases such as AIDS, leprosy and cataract blindness; and state health sector reform. In&#13;
3 NABARD is an apex development finance institution for agriculture and rural credit. It was established in 1982&#13;
by an Act of Parliament, and took over certain development and statutory functions from the Reserve Bank of&#13;
India (RBI), and refinance functions from the Agriculture Refinance and Development Corporation. It works&#13;
under the overall guidance and control of RBI in regard to monetary policies, credit expansion, interest rate,&#13;
etc. It supplements the resources of banks by providing refinance to Commercial Banks, Cooperative Banks&#13;
and Regional Rural Banks for rural credit, based on certain parameters and limits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
agriculture, 133 operations have received US$10.6 billion equivalent of IBRD/IDA financing (19&#13;
percent IBRD, 81 percent IDA), with irrigation projects dominating the portfolio. Other areas&#13;
financed have included: agricultural support services (research, extension, credit), commercial&#13;
agriculture (seeds, fisheries, sericulture, dairy, rubber), forestry, watershed development, and three&#13;
state-specific (Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Assam) agricultural development projects. Several of&#13;
these projects have focussed attention on women's participation in the economic activities, and&#13;
some have used the modality of women's group formation. In Uttar Pradesh IDA is assisting a&#13;
Sodic Lands Reclamation Project (Cr. 251 0-IN) which includes a component to form women's self-&#13;
help groups with the help of NGOs to augment the income of poor farm families. The Women's&#13;
Enterprise Management Training Outreach Program (WEMTOP), sponsored by the Economic&#13;
Development Institute (EDI), has worked through local NGOs to provide management training to&#13;
poor and illiterate women micro-entrepreneurs, and developed expertise in micro-enterprise and&#13;
participatory monitoring and evaluation skills. The project operated in selected areas in Bihar,&#13;
Orissa and Rajasthan.&#13;
1.20        Implementation Performance and Lessons Learned. Project Completion&#13;
Reports (PCRs) or Performance Audit Reports (PARs) are available for a number of social and&#13;
agricultural sector projects. While the projects have met an important part of their development&#13;
objectives, they have suffered from a number of generic implementation problems. These have&#13;
included: late start-up, poor procurement, slow disbursement, institutional weaknesses, including&#13;
frequent management turnover, untimely and inadequate flow-of-funds, poor quality of civil works&#13;
and maintenance of building and equipment, and inadequate attention to software and qualitative&#13;
aspects. In addition, some specific lessons of relevance to the proposed project have highlighted&#13;
the importance of early action on: (a) social assessment to underpin targeting of beneficiaries and&#13;
their participation, both in the design and implementation of project activities; (b) clearly defined&#13;
arrangements for the participation of NGOs which are committed to the objectives of the project;&#13;
(c) strong monitoring and evaluation arrangements with flexibility in project design to allow&#13;
introduction of appropriate and timely corrective action; and (d) greater participation by the private&#13;
sector, especially in input delivery.&#13;
F. Experience of IFAD Supported Projects&#13;
1.21        IFAD lending. IFAD's lending to India in the past ten years has been directed&#13;
towards the most vulnerable groups in rural society, namely Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled&#13;
Tribes (STs), landless, small and marginal farmers, and women. Support for women was targeted&#13;
in the freestanding Tamil Nadu Women's Development Project which formed women's SHGs,&#13;
supported by NGOs and animators, to mobilize women and build self-reliance through self-&#13;
managed group savings funds and improved access to credit for suitable economic activities. The&#13;
Maharashtra Rural Credit Project and two Andhra Pradesh Tribal Development Projects also&#13;
incorporate components specifically directed towards increasing women's self-reliance and&#13;
improving their access to credit through the formation of women's SHGs. The respective state&#13;
WDCs are involved in the implementation of the Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra projects. Through&#13;
their involvement in the projects, these WDCs have been strengthened and oriented towards the&#13;
needs of poor rural women.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
1.22        Implementation Performance and Lessons Learned. General lessons emerging&#13;
from these recent projects are that: (a) the development of grassroots institutions is essential if&#13;
benefits acquired by the poor are to be protected; (b) the landless and women need to be specifically&#13;
targeted; and (c) economic development is a necessary but insufficient condition to improve the lot&#13;
of women and other deprived groups; attention needs also to be given to empowerment to ensure&#13;
that the financial rewards of their efforts remain under their control.&#13;
1.23        The lessons learned from past IDA and IFAD lending are central to the design of&#13;
the proposed project, providing a number of specific lessons for group formation and management.&#13;
These include: (a) in facilitating effective implementation of women's development initiatives,&#13;
NGOs can play a key role but their caliber and performance are crucial to the success of the&#13;
project and they often require training and capacity building with regard to participatory&#13;
processes and sustaining groups; (b) one of the best indicators of the dynamism and cohesion of a&#13;
group is the degree of rotation of small loans to members based on their own savings before&#13;
accessing bank credit; (c) the process of federating groups into a cluster should not be undertaken&#13;
until the groups have attained a mature level of functioning, appreciate the importance of a&#13;
federation, and are in a position to control it; (d) capacity of agencies involved in project&#13;
implementation, especially at the district level, should be carefully evaluated and, wherever&#13;
appropriate, strengthened to effectively implement the project; (e) lending institutions involved&#13;
in financing groups need to have staff trained in working with resource poor clients; (f) emphasis&#13;
needs to be placed on diversifying the productive activities undertaken by women which must&#13;
have good market potential; and (g) members are willing to borrow without subsidies provided&#13;
loans are given on time and investments are sound.&#13;
G. Project Preparation Process&#13;
1.24        District Selection Criteria. The selection criteria used by the state agencies in&#13;
identifying the project districts included: economic and social backwardness (poverty, female&#13;
illiteracy, adverse sex ratio, percentage of SCs and STs); regional socio-economic variations&#13;
within the states; and implementation capacity (availability of NGOs, lending institutions, and&#13;
public and private sector support agencies). Information on the districts selected as a result of&#13;
this work is given in para 2.07 and Annex 3.&#13;
1.25        Participatory Preparation Process. The project has been prepared with the&#13;
participation of all the key stakeholders and has been finalized after wide consultations with them&#13;
during pre-appraisal and appraisal. The key implementing agencies, the state WDCs, prepared&#13;
initial project proposals in December 1994 with the help of consultants and interactions with&#13;
potential women beneficiaries, women members of existing SHGs, and potential NGO partners.&#13;
IFAD supported the preparation process on an on-going basis and held consultations with public&#13;
and private agencies on problems faced by women. These discussions were followed by joint&#13;
Bank-IFAD missions which verified the recommendations of the preparation report. Jointly with&#13;
WDCs, these missions held detailed discussions with NABARD, financial institutions, other&#13;
resource institutions and bilateral donor agencies involved in assisting women's development,&#13;
especially to draw on existing experience. Discussions were also held with key providers of&#13;
technical support services in both the public and private sectors to elicit their support and to&#13;

define areas of their likely assistance under the project. State and district level officials and&#13;
elected representatives participated in discussions and provided information and views which&#13;
influenced the development of project objectives, scope and activities. Finally, workshop held at&#13;
the start of the Appraisal Mission, attended by the WDCs, collaborating NGOs, bankers and&#13;
other resource agencies, facilitated a thorough review of the project proposals and resulted in&#13;
refinements of the project proposal. The preparation report was shared with a group of NGOs&#13;
prior to appraisal to elicit their views on the proposed project design and its components.&#13;
Consultations were also held with representatives of a selected number of bilateral donors. The&#13;
proposed project responds to guidance received during these consultations. These consultations&#13;
also highlighted the need for flexibility in the design of this process oriented project so as to&#13;
respond to changing needs and to develop mutually beneficial alliances with others working on&#13;
women's issues.&#13;
1.26        Project Preparation Facility Advance. In July 1996, in response to a request&#13;
from GOI, the Bank provided a US$250,000 Project Preparation Facility (PPF) Advance. The&#13;
advance is being used to launch pre-project activities on a pilot basis to generate experience to&#13;
expedite implementation following effectiveness, and to strengthen the capacity of the key&#13;
project implementors in preparation for project start-up. Specifically, the advance is financing&#13;
the induction of NGOs and the formation by them of a limited number of SHGs, and orientation&#13;
and training of project implementors to the project concept. A portion of the IDA credit would&#13;
be used to refinance the advance.&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Rationale&#13;
2.01        The strategy for Bank assistance to India is to support policies and investments&#13;
that promote economic growth and social development in the context of macro-economic&#13;
stability. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY96-98 (Report No. 14509),&#13;
emphasizes the need to support the government's development policies aimed at reducing&#13;
poverty, which remains India's major socio-economic problem. Further, it supports the&#13;
government's plans to facilitate greater private sector participation in a wide range of economic&#13;
activities and to accelerate human resource development with special attention to gender issues.&#13;
The government in India has shown increasing concern with the quality of growth and with how&#13;
the benefits of growth are distributed across regions and social groups. The FY97 progress&#13;
report on the CAS stresses the need for Bank operations to focus attention on the redressal of&#13;
gender inequalities to enhance the quality and level of economic development in the country. Set&#13;
in the context of the government's policies and the Bank's enhanced efforts to address gender&#13;
issues effectively in its portfolio, the proposed project is consistent with the CAS. The proposed&#13;
operation would also be consistent with the policy changes being proposed by the Bank under the&#13;
Rural Financial Reform Program (RFRP). While emphasizing the financial self-sustainability of&#13;
lending institutions, the RFRP would work with the Government to expand poverty-reduction&#13;
activities, especially the SHG linkage program already started by NABARD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
2.02         The project would also be consistent with the Country Department's women-in-&#13;
development strategy which emphasizes: (i) widening efforts to reach women with basic&#13;
amenities and services; (ii) addressing issues of gender bias and the social constraints facing&#13;
women in order to orient services to them as well as to create effective demand for the services;&#13;
and (iii) linking economic and social services to capitalize on their mutually reinforcing effects&#13;
and thereby enhance their effectiveness. The Bank's research indicates that there are significant&#13;
gains from investing in women.4 Expanding women's economic opportunities and increasing the&#13;
income they control results in greater economic efficiency, improved child health and nutrition,&#13;
and reduced poverty.&#13;
2.03         The project would be consistent with IFAD's Strategy for the Economic&#13;
Advancement of Poor Rural Women which emphasises the need for: (i) rural women to organise&#13;
themselves into social and economic groups if they are to assert their role and benefit equitably&#13;
from economic development; (ii) efforts to modify social attitudes and value systems; (iii)&#13;
enhanced financial services for poor rural women, with easy access, and which build on&#13;
mobilisation of their own savings through women managed thrift and credit; (iv) improved social&#13;
services to contribute to their productivity; and (v) the active promotion of women's role in the&#13;
development process and control over resources placed at their disposal.&#13;
2.04         The entrenched nature of constraints faced by women and limited success of past&#13;
government interventions has highlighted the need for new approaches to address the diverse&#13;
needs of women. The most important social innovation to help the poor in recent years has been&#13;
the success of the thrift and credit based SHGs, especially-those formed by women. These&#13;
groups, assisted by NGOs, have successfully developed a system of revolving credit for the&#13;
benefit of group members based on their own savings. Linking of SHGs to formal financial&#13;
institutions has further enhanced availability of credit financing to the groups with a high rate of&#13;
loan repayment. SHGs have been successful in generating additional income, jobs and small&#13;
enterprises. IDA's (and IFAD's) involvement in the proposed project would provide resources&#13;
for wider application of these successful models and innovative approaches developed in India&#13;
and overseas. IDA's and IFAD's assistance would strengthen the implementation capacity of&#13;
existing institutions, enable more effective utilization of resources allocated to women's programs,&#13;
and accelerate the learning process.&#13;
2.05        A favorable climate to address gender inequalities through grassroots institutions&#13;
has been created by the Panchayati Raj Act which ensures representation of women in local self-&#13;
government. This has led to a recognition of the need to develop women's capacities for more&#13;
effective participation in decision making. These developments offer a window of opportunity for&#13;
IDA and IFAD to focus a freestanding operation on improving the socio-economic status of poor&#13;
women. While a multi-state project would be resource intensive to manage and supervise, its&#13;
flexible approach would provide scope for innovation in operational modalities. The cultural,&#13;
ecological and socio-economic variations between the states will provide a broad-based learning&#13;
experience and the project would facilitate sharing of experience amongst the participating states.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
Ultimately, this would provide a better basis for policy dialogue with the Government on women's&#13;
issues.&#13;
2.06        Project Readiness. Since the appraisal of the project in July 1996, the participating&#13;
states have taken a number of actions to improve readiness to implement the project. These&#13;
include: formation of a small number of SHGs with the help of NGOs in selected blocks in one or&#13;
two districts; training of existing staff and participating NGOs in SHG concepts and Bank&#13;
procurement procedures; an inter-state workshop to exchange ideas and information; and&#13;
identification of resource institutions to assist in the implementation of the project. This has&#13;
enhanced implementation capacity and provided experience to expedite implementation following&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
2.07        In addition, prior to negotiations, both the DWCD, GOI and the state governments&#13;
have taken actions to expedite project implementation. DWCD has (i) appointed a Project&#13;
Implementation Expert at the CPSU; (ii) developed a draft Memorandum of Understanding&#13;
specifying funds flow and implementation arrangements to be signed by the DWCD, the nodal&#13;
departments of the state governments, and the state WDCs; (iii) identified the lead training&#13;
institution, viz. the National Institute of Public Cooperation and Child Development; and (iv)&#13;
prepared an Action Plan for the CPSU for the first fifteen months of the project (January 1997 to&#13;
March 1998). The states have (i) appointed a consultant or regular Project Director in Gujarat,&#13;
Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana; (ii) initiated formal hiring processes for the regular&#13;
Project Director and other key staff in all states except Bihar; (iii) prepared Procurement Plans for&#13;
the first two years of the project; (iv) established the State Project Steering Committee, State&#13;
Project Working Group and District Project Coordination Committee in the states of Gujarat,&#13;
Haryana and Madhya Pradesh; (v) signed contracts with an initial group of NGOs for the&#13;
implementation of the project in Phase I districts in Haryana, Gujarat, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh;&#13;
in the cases of Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, proposals for agreements with identified NGOs have&#13;
been received by IDA and will be completed following IDA approval; and (vi) prepared Action&#13;
Plans for the states for the first fifteen months of project implementation (January 1997 to March&#13;
1998).&#13;
2.08        During the first year after effectiveness, project activities would be restricted to a&#13;
few blocks in one or two districts in each state (with the exception of Uttar Pradesh where the&#13;
project would work with SHGs formed in 13 districts under the IDA-assisted U.P.Sodic Lands&#13;
Reclamation Project). Expansion of project activities to other districts would only take place after&#13;
the project implementors have acquired and trained the requisite staff, and ensured the availability&#13;
of trained NGOs and the responsiveness of other service providers. While the underlying concept&#13;
of the project builds on past experience (paras 1.20, 1.22 and 1.23), flexibility in the design, phased&#13;
implementation and concurrent M&amp;E system proposed under the project (paras 4.16 to 4.21) allows&#13;
for a process-oriented approach and the introduction of innovations while building the&#13;
implementation capacity of participating agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. Project Area and Target Group&#13;
2.09        Project Area. The project would be implemented in a limited number of blocks&#13;
in selected districts in the six states of Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Kamataka, Madhya Pradesh and&#13;
Uttar Pradesh. In the case of UP, the project would build on the experience of women's group&#13;
formation gained over the past three years by the UP Land Development Corporation (LDC)&#13;
under the IDA-assisted UP Sodic Lands Reclamation Project. The UPLDC has formed active&#13;
SHGs in 13 districts in which it operates. In addition, two new districts (Sitapur and Banda)&#13;
would be included in the project where activities would be coordinated by the UP Women's&#13;
Welfare Corporation (WWC). The districts presently identified in each state are listed below.&#13;
The list would be kept under review and any necessary changes, including additions, made&#13;
during project implementation would be in consultation and in keeping with criteria agreed with&#13;
IDA.&#13;

2.10        Target Group. The target group for the project would be women from rural&#13;
households below the poverty line, defined by the GOI as households of 5.5 persons with an annual&#13;
income below INR 11,000. The group would largely comprise women from marginal and small&#13;
farrn households and landless families. Particular emphasis would be placed on including both de&#13;
jure and defacto female heads of households, who constitute the most disadvantaged groups of&#13;
women. (In the country as a whole, 30 percent of poor households are estimated to be female&#13;
headed). In order to ensure strong, cohesive and sustainable affinity groups, no eligibility criteria&#13;
would be set beyond the poverty criterion in order to allow women genuine freedom of choice in&#13;
group membership. The participating NGOs would be responsible for identifying women&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
participants through consultative processes with communities. More information on the project&#13;
area and target group is given in Annex 3.&#13;
C. Project Objectives and Strategy&#13;
2.11         Objectives. Given the pervasive nature of the issues that negatively impact on&#13;
women, the overall objective of the project would be to strengthen processes that promote&#13;
economic development of women and create an environment for social change. The specific&#13;
objectives would be to: (a) establish women's self-help groups (SHGs) which build self-reliance&#13;
and self-confidence and provide them greater access to and control over resources; (b) sensitize and&#13;
strengthen the institutional capacity of support agencies (governnent, NGOs and banks) to&#13;
proactively address women's needs; (c) increase the incomes of poor women through their&#13;
involvement in income generating activities, thereby contributing to poverty alleviation; (d)&#13;
develop linkages between SHGs and lending institutions to ensure women's access to credit&#13;
financing; and (e) improve access to better health care, education and drudgery reduction facilities.&#13;
2.12         Strategy. The experience of other programs has shown that neither empowerment&#13;
through awareness raising alone, nor development through economic activity alone, can&#13;
satisfactorily address women's diverse needs. The strategy adopted in this project, therefore,&#13;
emphasizes the importance of an holistic approach including a judicious blend of empowerment&#13;
and development activities in order to have a broader impact on the lives of poor women. The&#13;
project builds on four "pillars", namely, the present successful experience with SHGs, the growing&#13;
response of banks to group lending, increasing opportunities provided through the Panchayati Raj&#13;
system for women to play a role in decision making, and the experience gained through other&#13;
programs including the IDA-assisted U.P. Sodic Lands Reclamation Project (Cr 2510-IN) and&#13;
IFAD's Tamil Nadu Women's Development Project.&#13;
2.13        Facilitating women's access to credit to increase their involvement in income&#13;
generating activities represents the core activity of the project. To this end, savings and credit (with&#13;
small loans based initially on the accumulated savings of the SHG) are the foundation for the SHGs&#13;
to build up a record of sound financial management and credit worthiness as the first step in&#13;
establishing a long-term relationship with the lending institutions. At the same time, the project&#13;
expands the scope of present successful SHG programs to providing assistance to enable women to&#13;
identify and establish viable and remunerative income generating activities.&#13;
2.14         To ensure that the process of empowerment is self-sustaining, the project focuses on&#13;
building women's institutions which will have the capacity to further their development on an on-&#13;
going basis. Women "owned" affinity groups are crucial to the empowerment process as they&#13;
provide: (a) mutual support for members and confidence to strive collectively for social change; (b)&#13;
a forum in which women can critically analyze their situations and devise strategies to overcome&#13;
their difficulties; (c) a framework for awareness raising, literacy, dissemination of information on&#13;
health, nutrition, family welfare and legal rights and for delivery of services; and (d) a locus for the&#13;
development of economic activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
2.15        To respond to women's diverse needs, the project focuses on developing&#13;
participatory processes to identify priorities and devise appropriate responses to meet them. In the&#13;
interests of sustainability and replicability, emphasis would be placed on developing the capacity of&#13;
mature SHGs to support the formation of additional groups. The formation of associations of&#13;
mature SHGs would also be encouraged, both as a means of providing on-going support to existing&#13;
groups and to further the expansion of the SHG movement.&#13;
2.16        Although flexibility would be essential to ensure that project activities respond to&#13;
the variations in socio-cultural situations between states, it is also important that the project pursues&#13;
a common philosophy. To achieve this, the following principles would guide the project&#13;
implementors: (a) self-reliance of the women's groups, with support agencies working consciously&#13;
towards withdrawal; (b) sustainability of groups, highlighting the importance of the quality of&#13;
group formation (rather than the number of groups formed); (c) ownership and control by the&#13;
women so that they determine the form, nature, content and timing of all activities undertaken by&#13;
the SHGs; (d) the facilitative (non-directive) role of project ftmctionaries; (e) accountability of all&#13;
project actions to the SHGs; and (f) evaluation of project performance as reflected in the strength&#13;
and sustainability of SHGs, income generated by the economic activities, and increased capacity of&#13;
the support agencies to carry the program forward beyond the project period.&#13;
D. Summary Description of Project Components&#13;
2.17        The proposed project would be implemented over a five-year period and could be&#13;
the start of a long-term program to improve women's economic and social status. The project&#13;
would pursue its objectives through the following components:&#13;
(a)   Institutional Capacity Building for Women 's Development including: (i)&#13;
establishing self-reliant women's groups through support to NGOs to establish women's&#13;
SHGs based on savings and credit; building capacity of new and existing SHGs through&#13;
training and awareness raising; and assisting them to establish a track record of sound&#13;
credit management to make them attractive clients to the lending institutions. The project&#13;
would strengthen the capacity of support agencies, e.g., WDCs, NGOs, financial&#13;
institutions and line departments to provide better service to poor women and sensitize&#13;
them to gender issues.&#13;
(b) Establish Support Mechanisms for Women Managed Income Generating&#13;
Activities. The project would assist SHGs to access group loans from lending institutions&#13;
for investments in income generating activities following demonstration of capacity for&#13;
credit management based on the group's own savings. In addition, it would provide&#13;
support for skill training, technology transfer, technical support and promotion of market&#13;
linkages.&#13;
(c) Establish Mechanisms to Access Social Programs and Leverage Funds for&#13;
Community Assets Creation. To improve the quality of women's lives and release time&#13;
for productive purposes, the project would assist in improving women's access to social&#13;
services such as health and child care and create or improve community assets such as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
drinking water and multipurpose meeting halls by leveraging contributions from on-going&#13;
government programs or the community. Priorities for such investments would be&#13;
decided in consultation with the communities.&#13;
(d) Provide Effective Project Management Systems. The project would strengthen&#13;
capacity of central and state level agencies to manage the project based on&#13;
implementation experience and feedback provided by the concurrent monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system to be established under the project.&#13;
E. Detailed Features&#13;
(A) Component 1: Institutional Capacity Building for Women's Development (US$14.0 million;&#13;
28 percent of Base Cost)&#13;
2.18        The formation of strong and sustainable SHGs would be the primary focus of this&#13;
component. The groups would be supported to acquire the skills to control and manage their&#13;
own affairs effectively. To facilitate this, the participating agencies would be strengthened and&#13;
sensitized to issues of gender equity, oriented to the SHG concept and trained in the specific&#13;
skills which they would be required to impart to the SHGs. Specific activities to be financed&#13;
under this component are described below.&#13;
(i)   Establishment of Self-Reliant Women's Groups (US$9.1 million; 18 percent&#13;
of Base Cost) (Annex 4)&#13;
(a) Formation/induction of SHGs. The project would support the establishment of new&#13;
SHGs. Some existing SHGs, limited to 30% of the total anticipated number in any state&#13;
program, would also be supported to gain early experience of SHG participation in&#13;
income generating activities and the development of group clusters/associations. In&#13;
selecting existing groups for project support, emphasis would be placed on identifying&#13;
those which have consistency with the project concept. (Additional information on the&#13;
approach to the induction of existing groups is given in Annex 4, Section F.) While the&#13;
project would not be target driven, indicative provision has been made for support to&#13;
around 7,400 SHGs. On the basis of implementation capacity, it is expected that these&#13;
would be distributed among the participating states as follows: Bihar - 600; Gujarat -&#13;
1,200; Haryana - 600; Karnataka - 1,200; Madhya Pradesh - 1,000 and Uttar Pradesh -&#13;
2,800. These numbers have been included for planning purposes. Decision on the&#13;
ultimate scale of the SHG program in each state would depend on its relative success as&#13;
determined by feedback from the project's concurrent M&amp;E system.&#13;
(b) SHG Capacity Building. The project would build the capacity of new and existing&#13;
women's SHGs by training group members or representatives in group dynamics, group&#13;
management, participatory skills, leadership skills, and awareness raising, including&#13;
social issues and legal rights. Appropriate information, education and communication&#13;
materials would be provided. Exposure visits and inter-group exchange visits&#13;
(recognized as one of the most effective learning processes) would also be supported.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
The project would assist the SHGs to establish a track record in sound management of&#13;
group savings and credit operations which would make them attractive clients to banks.&#13;
To facilitate this process, the project would provide intensive training in credit&#13;
management and accounts. The project would also provide the start-up materials (cash&#13;
box, accounts ledgers, minute books) required for the savings and credit operations.&#13;
Provision has been made for imparting functional literacy to group members. This is&#13;
considered important to facilitate the working of SHGs, particularly the maintenance of&#13;
accounts and records, to enable more women to take on leadership responsibilities, and to&#13;
facilitate access to information for both economic and social development. Based on&#13;
lessons drawn from other functional literacy programs, the project would support&#13;
modification and printing of available post-literacy reading materials,&#13;
orientation/retraining of literacy teachers, and coverage of the costs incurred to meet&#13;
location specific needs by the NGOs managing this activity. Such literacy training would&#13;
be provided only when there is demand for it from the concerned SHG, and the SHG (or&#13;
its community) is willing to bear the cost of sustaining the activity, if necessary, after the&#13;
18-month period which is considered a reasonable time for group members to acquire&#13;
basic functional literacy.&#13;
(c) Formation of New Groups with the Help of Mature SHGs. In order to promote the&#13;
wider replication of SHGs in a more cost effective and sustainable manner, the project&#13;
would, on an experimental basis, use mature SHGs to promote the formation of&#13;
additional SHGs. The project would identify SHG members with leadership ability and&#13;
provide them with additional training and exposure visits to assist them to undertake this&#13;
responsibility.&#13;
(d) Promotion of SHG Clusters and Associations. The project would also facilitate the&#13;
formation of clusters of (15-25) SHGs (CGs) and associations of (4-8) SHG clusters&#13;
(ACs) to provide on-going support to the groups and promote further expansion of group&#13;
formation. The emergence of such clusters/ associations amongst mature groups would&#13;
be demand driven and allow for organic growth in response to changing needs. Project&#13;
assistance would comprise provision of expert advice for the development of appropriate&#13;
institutional structures, orientation of NGOs to the functioning of clusters/associations,&#13;
leadership training for cluster/association leaders, provisions for exposure visits to&#13;
existing SHG associations, and networking of clusters/associations both within and&#13;
outside the project to facilitate exchange of ideas. Prior to launching the process, the&#13;
project would commission a study by management experts to distill relevant knowledge&#13;
and develop guidelines on key institutional parameters. The formation of such&#13;
clusters/associations would be tried initially in the states where SHGs already exist in the&#13;
project districts. More information on the proposed guiding principles, based on current&#13;
experience, is given in Annex 6. At Negotiations, assurances were obtained that, by&#13;
March 31, 1998, DWCD would (i) establish an advisory panel including NGOs with&#13;
experience of CG/AC formation; and (ii) organize a workshop at which the members of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
the advisory panel would assist the participating NGOs to devise a strategy for the&#13;
formation of CGs/ACs.&#13;
(e) NGO Support. The project would engage the services, on contract, of outside&#13;
intervenors to form and sustain SHGs, and would finance the costs of field staff and other&#13;
operational expenses. Since NGOs are recognized to be the most effective agents for&#13;
mobilizing and providing on-going support to women's groups, project activities would&#13;
start in districts/blocks with strong NGOs. The selection of NGOs with an orientation&#13;
towards promoting self-reliant women's groups would be crucial to the success of the&#13;
project. Where NGOs with such an orientation lack actual experience of working with&#13;
SHGs, training would be provided by NGOs or other agencies with appropriate&#13;
experience. The selection criteria and roles and responsibilities of NGOs in the project&#13;
are described in Annex 5. In areas without experienced NGOs, WDCs and experienced&#13;
NGOs would identify socially motivated people within the community to form and&#13;
support SHGs following appropriate exposure and training. At Negotiations, assurances&#13;
were obtained from DWCD and the state WDCs that: (a) NGOs contracted under the&#13;
project would be selected according to the criteria specified in Annex 5; and (b) by&#13;
December 31, 1998, DWCD would appoint an NGO or other suitably qualified agency to&#13;
undertake an independent assessment of the performance of the NGOs and of the&#13;
participatory management processes under the project, and agree with IDA and IFAD on&#13;
an action plan to implement its recommendations.&#13;
(ii) Strengthen Participating Agencies to Support Women's Development (US$4.9&#13;
million; 10 percent of Base Cost)&#13;
Promoting attitudinal change and improving the ability of institutions working with poor&#13;
women to design and manage effective programs are key elements in equipping support&#13;
agencies to provide better assistance to women. To facilitate this, the project would&#13;
sensitize the agencies involved in the project to gender issues, namely, the WDCs, NGOs,&#13;
financial institutions, line departments and other resource agencies, and strengthen their&#13;
capacity to assist women. In-country and overseas study tours and exposure visits would&#13;
be available for key staff to increase their awareness of women's development potential&#13;
and initiatives. Appropriate information, education and communications materials would&#13;
be produced to facilitate the orientation and training of staff. Activities to be financed in&#13;
relation to specific agencies would include:&#13;
(a) Women's Development Corporations (WDCs). To strengthen the implementation&#13;
capacity of WDCs, the project would assist in the provision of professional staff and&#13;
necessary support facilities. It would also provide training to enhance management skills,&#13;
participatory processes including ability to work with SHGs, gender sensitivity, and&#13;
communication skills. The organizational structure of the state WDCs would be modified&#13;
to accommodate the requisite skills, namely, business development, marketing, and&#13;
training. At the same time, WDCs would engage independent qualified financial&#13;
management consultants to strengthen their financial management system (accounting,&#13;
auditing and internal control) which at present is weak. The incremental staff to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
provided at the state level would be a Monitoring Officer, Marketing Coordinator,&#13;
Training Coordinator, Communications Officer and Finance Officer. During&#13;
Negotiations, the government provided assurances that: (a) by June 30, 1997, all&#13;
participating WI)Cs would establish accounting, auditing and internal control practices&#13;
acceptable to IDA; (b) by March 31, 1999, DWCD would organize a management review&#13;
of the WDCs to further assess the longer term role of WDCs in assisting women's&#13;
development programs and recommend appropriate adjustments in roles, operational&#13;
structures and management systems and identify key training needs.&#13;
(b) Non Governmental Organizatons (NGOs). The capacity of partner NGOs would be&#13;
strengthened to enable them to provide more effective support under the project and to&#13;
enhance their commitment and orientation to assisting women's development in the&#13;
longer term. Training would be provided in participatory processes for effective&#13;
interaction with groups, gender sensitization, communication skills, the SHG concept,&#13;
group development processes, group accounts and record keeping, and entrepreneurship&#13;
development to enable them to become more effective promoters of economic activities.&#13;
Where necessary, resource NGOs would assist in building the capacity of smaller, local&#13;
NGOs.&#13;
(c)Financial Institutions/line departments. The project would also sensitize staff at&#13;
financial institutions and selected technical line department staff to gender issues and&#13;
strengthen their capacity to actively promote women's development by providing training&#13;
in the SHG concept, participatory management, gender sensitization and communication.&#13;
B. Component 2: Support Mechanisms for Women Managed Income Generating&#13;
Activities (US$20.3 million; 40 percent of Base Cost)&#13;
2.19        Economic activities to be taken up would be selected by the women participants&#13;
from a range of on-farm and non-farm activities. Most activities taken up are likely to be carried&#13;
out on an individual basis, with women within a group being able to opt for different activities.&#13;
Some activities may however be undertaken by a number of women within or across groups, who&#13;
may join together to utilize common supply, processing and/or marketing facilities. The uptake&#13;
of income generating activities would be facilitated through access to credit, skill training,&#13;
technology transfer, technical support and promotion of market linkages. A communications&#13;
component would underpin these activities. Existing materials would be used wherever&#13;
appropriate. Where gaps exist, the project would finance production of suitable booklets and&#13;
pamphlets as reference material, posters, videos, audio cassettes, radio programs, plays and case&#13;
studies presenting role models of women entrepreneurs who are implementing micro-enterprise&#13;
activities successfully.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
(i)    Mobilization of Investment Funds for Income Generating Activities (US$11.8&#13;
million; 23 percent of Base Cost) (Annex 7)&#13;
The two main sources of investment funds for income generating activities would be&#13;
members' own equity represented by their savings, and credit from lending institutions.&#13;
The expertise of group members in credit management, which would determine SHGs&#13;
ability to access funds from lending institutions, would be developed through a step-wise&#13;
process. The first step would involve utilization of funds from members' own savings&#13;
mainly for small loans to meet consumption and other social needs. This would enable&#13;
the group to gain experience of managing credit, instill credit discipline, and build up a&#13;
track record of sound credit management In the second stage (approximately 6-12&#13;
months after group formation), to augment funds available through the limited savings&#13;
capacity of group members, SHGs would be linked with a bank to obtain a line of credit&#13;
up to an agreed limit, initially equivalent to their own savings, which they can draw on as&#13;
required for consumption and/or other purposes. The cash credit limit arrangement&#13;
provides groups easy access to bank loans with a minimum of processing formalities and&#13;
restrictions on the use of funds. Its use, in turn, allows a group to strengthen its credit&#13;
history. The cash credit limit is gradually raised in line with the improving credit record&#13;
of the group. In the third stage (12-24 months after formation), the SHG may obtain a&#13;
group term loan from a lending institution, the ratio depending on the bank's assessment&#13;
of the performance of the group in managing funds. Alternatively, the SHG may continue&#13;
with the cash credit arrangement. In either case the loan would be managed by the SHG&#13;
and be disbursed as individual loans to members primarily for investment in income&#13;
generating activities.&#13;
The project would support the provision of training to SHGs in credit management and&#13;
accounts to enable them to establish their "credit rating". The credit requirements of the&#13;
SHGs would be met by the lending institutions from their own funds and may be re-&#13;
financed by NABARD from its own resources.5 Wherever the coverage or response of&#13;
the banking system is inadequate, credit funds to SHGs could be provided by other&#13;
financial institutions provided SHGs are charged market interest rates, and are free to&#13;
establish the interest rate to be charged to their members. Other agencies, who channel&#13;
funds to NGOs for on-lending to SHGs, include Friends of Women's World Banking&#13;
(FWWB), NABARD's scheme for bulk loans to NGOs, and Rashtriya Mahila Kosh&#13;
(RMK, the National Women's Credit Fund), once its lending terms are appropriate.6&#13;
In discussions with the mission, NABARD agreed to provide funds from its own resources to refinance any&#13;
formal sector lending institution supporting SHGs under the project and, if necessary, to provide bulk loans to&#13;
NGOs to finance SHGs.&#13;
6   The present constitution of RMK does not allow SHGs the flexibility to determine interest rates but requires&#13;
RMK funds to be on-lent to the final borrower at an interest rate not exceeding 12%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
(ii)   Provision of Business Management and Technical Support Services to SHG&#13;
Members (US$8.5 million; 17 percent of Base Cost).&#13;
(a)   On-farm activities (Annex 8). Investments in on-farm activities would be&#13;
aimed first at consolidating the food and income base of participating women and then on&#13;
embarking on a growth path through improvements in crop and animal productivity and&#13;
onto diversification. Activities would begin with effortsto improve the sustainability of&#13;
rainfed agriculture through the introduction of improved land and water conservation&#13;
measures. Later, to assist members to optimize returns from their limited resources,&#13;
extension support would be provided to introduce activities with potential for higher&#13;
financial returns, such as the cultivation of herbs, spices, fruits, vegetables and flowers.&#13;
To minimize risk, only known technologies, which the women and their families have&#13;
been unable to access, would be promoted. Attempts would also be made to introduce&#13;
the women into market processes and other activities, e.g., storage, grading and packing,&#13;
that add value to the basic agricultural cycle. Livestock activities would focus on sheep&#13;
and goats in small units which can be easily managed by women alongside their other&#13;
work. Support would include the dissemination of improved feeding practices and&#13;
greater emphasis on fodder production and animal health. Later in the project, to improve&#13;
the terms on which women participate in markets, the formation of inter-SHG commodity&#13;
groups/producer associations focused on the production, processing and marketing of a&#13;
specific product and its by-products would be encouraged, with SHGs taking&#13;
responsibility for the running costs of groups/producer associations.&#13;
The project would support the transfer of technology to women through training,&#13;
exposure visits and crop and livestock demonstrations. Resource persons, preferably&#13;
from the SHGs, would be trained by line departments and/or NGOs to manage&#13;
demonstration plots and to facilitate dissemination of information under the overall&#13;
guidance of technical staff from the line departments. Some of these resource persons&#13;
would be trained as para-vets. The project would promote improvements in linkages with&#13;
other programs to improve access to infrastructure such as wells and soil and moisture&#13;
conservation measures leading to higher productivity. The project would also finance&#13;
demonstration units for technologies to reduce drudgery in agricultural tasks and&#13;
domestic chores undertaken by women such as improved farm implements designed for&#13;
use by women and simple domestic agro-processing equipment.&#13;
(b)   Non-farm activities (Annex 9). The project would support the contracting&#13;
of specialized agencies to conduct market studies and techno-economic surveys at the&#13;
village level to develop a menu of options for feasible, location specific, investment&#13;
opportunities with market potential, based initially on local skills and resources.&#13;
Thereafter, the project would assist groups to upgrade designs and production skills,&#13;
standardize production techniques, and improve quality control. The project would also&#13;
facilitate the marketing of finished products by linking groups with marketing agencies&#13;
who can provide advice on marketing strategies and assist in establishing market&#13;
linkages. The NGOs working with the SHGs would be trained in business development&#13;
to improve their ability to guide women in the selection of appropriate income generating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
activities and to coordinate the provision of the necessary support services. To counteract&#13;
the weakness of past production-led development initiatives, the identification of non-&#13;
farm activities related to production, trading and service areas would be market-led.&#13;
Given the weakness of the support structure for non-farm activities in most states, the&#13;
project would contract agencies with recognized expertise in entrepreneurship and&#13;
business development to create capacity among local agencies to transfer business,&#13;
technical and marketing skills to the SHGs. This would include the identification of&#13;
successful local entrepreneurs willing to assist women in the formative stages of&#13;
businesses. A list of possible agencies with recognized expertise is given in Annex 9.&#13;
Where suitable agencies are not available within the state, the WDCs would establish&#13;
links with recognized national specialist agencies to access appropriate expertise.&#13;
C. Component 3. Establish Mechanisms to Access Social Programs and Leverage Funds&#13;
for Community Asset Creation (US$7.8 million; 15 percent of Base Cost)&#13;
2.20        To improve quality of women's lives and to assist in releasing time and energy&#13;
spent in domestic chores for more productive purposes, the project would facilitate group access&#13;
to social services and assist in leveraging funds for the provision of community assets. Health,&#13;
child care, drinking water supply, sanitation and community meeting places are some of the&#13;
priority areas identified through interviews with potential beneficiaries. The project would&#13;
promote mechanisms to improve participation of the wider communities in accessing these&#13;
benefits. This would help to promote harmonious relations between the SHGs and their&#13;
communities, and enhance the status of group members in the community. All social activities&#13;
would be backed up by appropriate information, education and communications support. More&#13;
information on the operational modalities for the implementation of this component is given in&#13;
Annex 10. Specific activities to be financed under the project are briefly described below.&#13;
(i)    Health Promotion. Where basic health care is expressed as a priority&#13;
need, and there is a gap in services being provided by the health department, the project&#13;
would assist to train a person selected by the group in consultation with the wider&#13;
community (either from the group or a community member). Once trained, this person&#13;
would disseminate information on health related issues and promote preventive health&#13;
care; help group members and other village women to access the formal health system&#13;
(the Sub-Center and the Primary Health Center (PHC)/Community Health Center&#13;
(CHC)/Hospital) or private health facilities, with a focus on women and child health; and,&#13;
if necessary, provide basic health care. A specialist NGO would be engaged to provide&#13;
training to selected volunteers using course contents approved by the state health&#13;
department. The project would also assist with refresher training and provide materials, a&#13;
simple basic kit of equipment and supplies, to the trainee. The contents of the kit would&#13;
be in keeping with practices approved by the state health department.&#13;
As in the case of functional literacy, this provision would be available to a&#13;
community only when there is demand for it and the community is willing to bear the cost&#13;
of sustaining the activity after cessation of direct support under the project. A stepwise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
approach is envisaged with regard to the activities of the health worker whereby, after&#13;
training, the focus of her work would initially be with the group. This would involve only a&#13;
part-time commitment and, in the context of mutual help within the group, it is envisaged&#13;
that no stipend would be necessary. As she gains in confidence and the value of her&#13;
services is perceived by the wider community, her services would be extended to the&#13;
community on a fee basis in response to demand.&#13;
(ii)   Child Care for Working Mothers. Under certain circumstances (e.g.,&#13;
where women are working some distance from their homes and the extended family&#13;
network has broken down), and in response to demand, the project would make provision&#13;
for child care facilities in order to enable women to engage in additional income&#13;
generating activities. This would be done in a manner which is sustainable and does not&#13;
impact negatively on the motivation and behavior of the group. First, SHGs would be&#13;
encouraged to lobby for the extension of existing programs, such as the Integrated Child&#13;
Development Services (ICDS) program or national/state creche programs to their village,&#13;
or for their modification (e.g. in timings or location) to meet women's needs. Where an&#13;
appropriate response is not forthcoming, the project provides for established SHGs (at&#13;
least one year old) to receive assistance towards the honorarium of a child minder for two&#13;
years on a sliding scale (90 percent in the first year and 60 percent in the second year).&#13;
Thereafter, the SHG would take responsibility for financing this service. The project&#13;
would also provide some initial equipment. The honoraria for the child minders would be&#13;
on the scales and pattern of other schemes for creches/day care in the area. This&#13;
provision would only be made available provided the SHG is willing and an agreement&#13;
has been signed between the WDC and the group to meet the costs of sustaining the&#13;
activity beyond the two year period.&#13;
(iii)   Assistance to Leverage Funds for Community Asset Creation. The&#13;
project would assist communities to create needed assets such as drinking water facilities,&#13;
sanitation, multipurpose halls (e.g., workshed/day care center) or acquire teaching/leaming&#13;
materials for schools or pre-school groups. A fixed monetary sum of Rs. 60,000 would be&#13;
provided per "natural village",7 which would be used to leverage resources in cash or kind&#13;
from other development schemes as well as community contributions, so that the assets&#13;
created under the project could be the nuclei of larger community development activities.&#13;
This approach would avoid duplication of effort and promote convergence with on-going&#13;
programs. For civil works, the project would fund 90 percent of the cost of the community&#13;
project. The funds available to each village under the project may be spent on several items&#13;
in small amounts, or all at once on a single major asset. Rehabilitation of a building which&#13;
has been fully handed over the the women's groups by local bodies/government for their&#13;
use would also qualify for project financing.&#13;
A natural village is defined as a recognized, spatially distinct aggregation of households. An administrative&#13;
village may comprise 2-3 natural villages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
Once a community has agreed on a priority activity, a resolution would be passed by&#13;
the concerned panchayats/local bodies to formalize the commitment to contribute funds&#13;
and/or to assist in the creation/maintenance of asset(s) to be financed under the project.&#13;
This information would be made available to the WDC for the preparation of an appropriate&#13;
agreement specifying agreed arrangements for financing and operation and maintenance.&#13;
Further details of the operational steps to be followed to utilize this assistance are given in&#13;
Annex 10. In general, the choice and location for the asset creation activity wouuld be&#13;
based on strengths of the SHGs, NGQs, and the WDC. More specific criteria to be used in&#13;
allocating funds to selected activities would include:&#13;
(a)   SHG initiating the request to access funds has been in operation for a&#13;
minimum of 12 months and is functioning harmoniously under the guidance&#13;
of an experienced NGO (indicators of group viability and stability from the&#13;
M&amp;E would facilitate identification of groups which satisfy this criteria);&#13;
(b)   a process of consultation with the community to determine priorities for&#13;
investment has been completed under the guidance of the participating&#13;
NGO;&#13;
(c)   an agreement between SHG, Panchayat/local body Representative, District&#13;
Manager/DDO/CEO, WDC and District Magistrate has been signed&#13;
specifying arrangements for operation and maintenance of the asset once&#13;
created to ensure funding and sustainability;&#13;
(d)   satisfactory arrangements for the procurement of civil works has been&#13;
agreed with IDA; and&#13;
(e)   project supervision by IDA has indicated that WDC is performing well and&#13;
without political interference.&#13;
2.21        At Negotiations, the government provided assurances that before providing&#13;
assistance for social programs or for leveraging funds for community asset creation, WDCs&#13;
would ensure that: (a) consultation with the community has taken place to prioritize activities to&#13;
be supported under the project; (b) agreement has been reached with the community to support&#13;
the health and child care programs after funding from the project has been withdrawn; and (c) an&#13;
agreement has been signed specifying all sources of funding and operation and maintenance&#13;
arrangements for the community asset to be created under the project.&#13;
D. Component 4. Effective Project Management Systems (US$9.0 million; 17 percent of&#13;
Base Cost)&#13;
2.22         The provision for project management would complement the overall institutional&#13;
capacity building interventions described above and would be directed to the effective&#13;
implementation of project activities with the support of a comprehensive concurrent Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
(i)   Project Management (US$6.8 million; 13 percent of Base Cost)&#13;
The project would strengthen the capability of the Department of Women and&#13;
Child Development of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of&#13;
India (DWCD), to support the project by financing the establishment of a Central Project&#13;
Support Unit (CPSU). Located within DWCD, the CPSU would comprise a Women's&#13;
Development Expert, Project Implementation Expert, Finance/Monitoring Officer, two&#13;
second level officers (accounts and establishment) and four support staff (two&#13;
stenographers, one accounts assistant and one driver-cum-peon). Recruitment of these&#13;
incremental staff would be in phases in relation to the increasing workload of the project&#13;
and on such contractual terms as not to create any long-term liability on the part of GOI.&#13;
The project would similarly strengthen the capabilities of the state WDCs to manage the&#13;
day-to-day implementation of the project by providing support for incremental contract&#13;
staff, necessary office equipment, vehicles, and incremental operating costs on a&#13;
declining basis. The incremental staff would be the Project Director at the state level, and&#13;
a District Project Manager and Business Development Officer in each district, together&#13;
with supporting staff. In order to overcome the discontinuity in management of the&#13;
WDCs which results from the high tumover of Managing Directors, the project provides&#13;
for the hiring of key project staff (Project Director and District Project Managers) on an&#13;
extended tenure (at least three years). To obviate delays in project start-up, recruitment&#13;
of key staff for institutional strengthening and project management would be undertaken&#13;
around the same time. The key staff would include: the Women's Development Expert&#13;
and Project Implementation Expert for the CPSU, and the Project Directors, Training&#13;
Coordinators, Finance Officer and District Project Manager for the phase I districts in the&#13;
participating states. Appointment of key CPSU staff and completion of selection process&#13;
for WDC staff would be completed prior to Negotiations. The WDCs would engage the&#13;
Project Director as a consultant (Consultant Project Director) for the period until&#13;
formalities for the longer term appointment are completed. More information on the&#13;
proposed organization and management arrangements and Terms of Reference for the key&#13;
staff are given in Annex 11.&#13;
With the exception of appointment of the district level staff in Bihar who will be&#13;
engaged by partner NGO, at Negotiations, the government provided assurances that&#13;
WDCs would appoint: (a) the key staff including Project Director, District Project&#13;
Manager for each Phase I district, Training Coordinator and Finance Officer, whose&#13;
selection is to be completed prior to negotiations, would be confirmed in their respective&#13;
positions by February 28, 1997; (b) other incremental staff comprising of Monitoring&#13;
Officer, Marketing Coordinator, Communications Officer, Business Development Officer&#13;
and support staff for Phase I district, would be confirmed in their respective positions by&#13;
September 30, 1997; and (c) all district level staff for Phase II districts would be engaged&#13;
six months prior to commencement of project activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
(ii)   Concurrent Monitoring and Evaluation (US$2.2 million; 4 percent of Base&#13;
Cost)&#13;
Given the pilot nature of the project and the need to benefit from implementation&#13;
experience, the project would finance the establishment of a system to assimilate the&#13;
lessons emerging from project activities. A comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
(M&amp;E) system would comprise a computerized project management system (CPM),&#13;
management information system (MIS), and concurrent monitoring and evaluation to&#13;
assess implementation progress, quality of performance and sustainability on an on-going&#13;
basis. Annual Action Plans would be developed from the CPM and these would reflect&#13;
the actual status and performance of the project and lessons learnt from implementation&#13;
experience. More information on the development of the CPM, MIS, and M&amp;E systems&#13;
is given in Annex 14.&#13;
III. COST ESTIMATES, FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
A. Project Costs&#13;
3.01        Costs. Total project costs are estimated to be Rs. 2,322 million (US$53.8 million&#13;
equivalent), including physical and price contingencies (US$2.5 million) and taxes and duties&#13;
estimated at US$0.9 million equivalent. The direct and indirect foreign exchange cost is&#13;
estimated to be US$1.6 million, or 3% of total project costs. Base costs are in June 1996 prices.&#13;
Physical contingencies were applied to base costs at the rate of 10% for civil works, equipment,&#13;
materials and vehicles, and 5% for training, study tours, NGO support, local consultants,&#13;
contractual services, studies, surveys and workshops. The estimated costs of the project also&#13;
include price contingencies8 (US$0.3 million) for expected price escalation based on a rate of&#13;
2.3% per year for foreign exchange costs, while for local costs, price contingencies were added at&#13;
a rate of 7.5% for 97; 7% for 98; 6.7% for 99; 6.5% for 2000 and 6% for 2001 and'2002.&#13;
Foreign exchange conversions have been calculated in accordance with World Bank guidelines,&#13;
using the projections prevailing at appraisal. The project costs in the different participating states&#13;
would be: Bihar - US$5.4 million; Gujarat - US$9.0 million; Haryana - US$4.9 million;&#13;
Karnataka - US$9.0 million; Madhya Pradesh - US$8.5 million; Uttar Pradesh - US$14.7&#13;
million, and at the Central level would be - US$2.3 million. Details of project costs are given in&#13;
Annex 1. The breakdown of project costs by components and categories of expenditures are&#13;
summarized in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 below.&#13;
S July 26, 1996, price contingencies provided by SA2CI were used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
B. Financing&#13;
3.02        The proposed external financing for the project of US$38.7 million would&#13;
comprise an IDA Credit of US$19.5 million and an IFAD loan of US$19.2 million (see Annex&#13;
1). This would finance 74 percent of the project costs net of taxes. If the institutional finance&#13;
contribution to the project is excluded as it is not to be refinanced under the project, the total cost&#13;
becomesUS$45.0 million, and the external assistance of US$38.7 million then represents 86&#13;
percent of the project costs. GOI would finance US$3.7 million (6.9% of project costs),&#13;
including taxes of US$0.9 million. Institutional finance would cover US$8.5 million (16 percent&#13;
of project costs) and beneficiaries would contribute US$2.9 million (5.4 percent of project costs).&#13;
The financing plan is provided in Table 3.3. Compliance of the Borrower with all the conditions&#13;
of effectiveness of the IFAD Loan agreement would be a Condition of Effectiveness of the IDA&#13;
Credit.&#13;
3.03        The IDA Credit and IFAD loan would be made available on the standard terms&#13;
and conditions to GOI, which would bear the foreign exchange risk. As a centrally sponsored&#13;
project, the proceeds of the credit and loan would flow through MHRD/DWCD to the states as&#13;
grant. Prior to Negotiations the DWCD would develop a draft memorandum of understanding&#13;
specifying funds flow arrangements for the grant funds to be made available to individual&#13;
participating states. At Negotiations, the government provided assurances that GOI would make&#13;
part of the proceeds of the Credit available on a grant basis to WDCs under a Memorandum of&#13;
Understanding, to be entered into between GOI and each WDC, which is satisfactory to IDA.&#13;

3.04        Funds would be released in advance directly to the project accounts of the state&#13;
WDCs in four installments per year in accordance with the annual work plans and budgets.&#13;
Upon receipt of funds from DWCD, the state governments would transfer their quarterly&#13;
counterpart contributions immediately to the project accounts of the WDCs. Neither the first nor&#13;
second installments transferred each year by DWCD would require utilization certificates for the&#13;
prior project (or PPF) year but transfer of the third installment would be based on: (a) a careful&#13;
review of project progress reports from the preceding fiscal year with a focus on consistency with&#13;
project objectives and timely submission of withdrawal applications; (b) submission by the state&#13;
WDCs of utilization certificates that provide evidence that previously released funds for the prior&#13;
project (or PPF) fiscal year have been spent; and (c) budget outstanding adjusted to reflect&#13;
project performance and unspent balances. At Negotiations, the government provided assurances&#13;
that GOI would release about three months' anticipated project expenditures in advance direct to&#13;
the project accounts of the WDCs (in accordance with the amounts established in the Annual&#13;
Plans), with the first transfer being made within one month of project signing of the Credit/Loan;&#13;
and from participating state governments upon receipt of funds from GOI, would transfer their&#13;
quarterly counterpart contributions immediately to the project accounts of the WDCs.&#13;
3.05        The WDCs, as the main implementing agencies, would be responsible for&#13;
developing the annual budget for all project activities in consultation with the participating&#13;
agencies. The budget would be forwarded to DWCD for incorporation in MHRD's budget for the&#13;
year and to the state government nodal department for inclusion of the state counterpart&#13;
contribution in the state budget. Once the budget is approved, DWCD would release funds to the&#13;
WDCs in a phased manner. All funds to the state level participating agencies would be routed&#13;
through the WDCs, enabling the WDCs to check on the performance of each activity against the&#13;
agreed work program. All participating agencies would furnish to WDCs the necessary details&#13;
concerning their expenditure in an agreed format. WDCs would consolidate the information for&#13;
transmission to DWCD to facilitate the preparation and submission of reimbursement claims to&#13;
IDA/IFAD through the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA).&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
3.06        Procurement under the project would be undertaken by the state WDCs and, for&#13;
the centrally managed activities, by the CPSU (DWCD). As a condition of Negotiations, the&#13;
participating agencies would prepare a procurement plan for the first two years of the project.&#13;
Many of the procurement activities under do not lend themselves well to aggregation for bidding&#13;
as large single contracts. This is due to the widespread and decentralized nature of the activities&#13;
that will be conducted in 35 districts of six project states throughout the five year life of the&#13;
project. Table 3.4 summarizes the project items, their related cost estimates, and proposed&#13;
methods of procurement. Further details of procurement arrangements are given in Annex 17.&#13;
3.07        Project-related procurement of goods would follow National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) procedures acceptable to IDA using Bank approved bidding documents. Similarly&#13;
National Shopping procedures acceptable to the Association would be used. Project financed&#13;
consultants would be recruited according to the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by World&#13;
Bank Borrowers.&#13;

3.08        Civil Works (US$5.8 million). All the civil works would be for small and labor&#13;
intensive constructions, financed under the community assets creation program. These works&#13;
would be phased over the implementation period and spread over a large number of villages,&#13;
scattered in 35 districts of six participating states, with an average project funding of US$1,800&#13;
per village. The works to be financed would consist of construction of either a drinking water&#13;
well and/or hand-pump, community meeting place or other minor structures identified by the&#13;
community based on demand. These works would be carried out using one of the following&#13;
three methods: (a) community construction whereby the community would contract to undertake&#13;
the work and would engage adequate technical supervision; (b) the community (or project&#13;
authority where the community lacks adequate institutional capacity) would solicit quotations&#13;
from at least three contractors to ensure competitive pricing since the nature of the work does not&#13;
lend itself to an advertised bidding process; and (c) Force Account (this method would be limited&#13;
to 10% of all civil works under the project). Designs and construction drawings for community&#13;
meeting places would be prepared by qualified architects/engineers under the overall supervision&#13;
of the WDCs.&#13;
3.09        Furniture (US$0.3 million) and Equipment (US$1.0 million). Furniture and&#13;
equipment would be purchased on an annual basis in accordance with the phasing of project&#13;
activities. Equipment consists of computers and office equipment with contract costs of less than&#13;
US$10,000, and small items (other miscellaneous office equipment, agricultural tools and&#13;
household level agro-processing equipment as demonstration models) with unit costs of less than&#13;
US$500. Because of the phasing of project activities, only the purchase of computers and major&#13;
items of office equipment (such as photocopiers) for project start-up in Year 1 would be procured&#13;
through NCB (amounting to around 25% of total equipment purchases). Other equipment would&#13;
be procured through national shopping with solicitation of price quotations from at least three&#13;
bidders. Furniture, for which each contract is estimated to cost the equivalent of US$20,000 or&#13;
less, would be procured through national shopping.&#13;
3.10        Vehicles (US$0.7 million). Procurement of vehicles would be phased on an&#13;
annual basis over the first four years of the project in accordance with the requirements of project&#13;
activities as additional districts are brought into the project. The majority of the costs are for&#13;
jeeps to be used at the state and district headquarters. Because the project involves six states and&#13;
35 districts, no contract is expected to contain more than 5 vehicles, and the project does not lend&#13;
itself to ICB or NCB. (Experience of other projects in India has shown that competitive bidding&#13;
of small lots as either ICB or NCB has not yielded adequate vendor interest). However,&#13;
purchases of vehicles would be bulked whenever possible and procured at the state level. The&#13;
maximum size of contract is estimated to be around US$50,000. Procurement will be through&#13;
national rate contracts entered into by the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals&#13;
(DGS&amp;D) or local shopping procedures, comparing price quotations from at least three suppliers&#13;
to ensure competitive prices. One of these quotations may be from the state level rate contractor.&#13;
3.11        Materials (US$4.1 million). Materials required under the project are of a diverse&#13;
nature comprising a variety of different communications materials, inputs for crop&#13;
demonstrations, ledgers, record books and cash/storage boxes for the establishment of the SHGs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
and materials requirements, e.g., books identified by communities under the community assets&#13;
creation program. These materials would be purchased in small amounts throughout the life of&#13;
the project. Procurement would be through local shopping procedures, comparing price&#13;
quotations from at least three suppliers to ensure competitive prices, as bulking of requirements&#13;
for NCB is not a practical solution. Each contract not exceeding $2,000.&#13;
3.12        Consultancies, Contractual Services and Studies (US$6.8 million).&#13;
Consultancy services with consulting firms/individuals estimated at US$1.7 million and studies&#13;
estimated at US$1.2 million would be contracted in accordance with the Guidelines for Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers. Documents used for inviting proposals, terms of&#13;
reference for all consultancies and studies, and single source contracts would be subject to prior&#13;
review for all contracts valued at US$100,000 or more to be awarded to firms, and at US$50,000&#13;
or more to be awarded to individuals. Contractual services estimated at US$3.9 million would&#13;
comprise many small contracts awarded to individuals following state's procedures acceptable to&#13;
IDA.&#13;
3.13        NGO Services, Study Tours, Study Tours and Workshops (US$16.3 million).&#13;
NGO services (US$4.0 million) would be contracted in accordance with the Guidelines for Use&#13;
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers. NGOs would be selected in accordance with the&#13;
criteria agreed with IDA (Annex 5). Most contracts for NGO services would be less than&#13;
US$50,000. Study tours (US$1.7 million) and training and workshops (US$10.6 million)&#13;
include expenses for WDC, NGO and other implementing agency staff, as well as SHG&#13;
members over the life of the project. These would be procured using governmental/&#13;
administrative procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.14        Building Maintenance (US$0.2 million). Maintenance of civil works&#13;
constructed under the community assets creation program would be financed by the&#13;
communities.&#13;
3.15        Vehicle and Equipment Maintenance (US$0.7 million). Maintenance costs for&#13;
vehicles (US$0.4 million) and equipment (US$0.3 million) estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$25,000 per contract would be procured from local commercial suppliers of such services: (i)&#13;
through direct contracting; or (ii) under quotations solicited from at elast three suppliers in&#13;
accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.16        Other Incremental Recurrent Costs (US$6.3 million). Incremental staff&#13;
(US$2.7 million) would be hired on contract and selected through open competition. Operational&#13;
costs (US$3.6 million) would be incurred following standard GOS procedures.&#13;
3.17        IDA Review. All procurement for goods and works under contracts exceeding&#13;
US$100,000 or more would be subject to IDA's prior review; in addition, the first three NCB&#13;
contracts for goods in each state would be subject to prior review. Contracts for the hiring of&#13;
consulting firms each costing US$ 100,000 equivalent or more, and contracts for hiring individual&#13;
consultants each costing US$50,000 equivalent or more would be subject to prior review and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
approval by IDA. This would result in prior review of about 10% of all contracts. Contracts&#13;
below the threshold levels would be subject to random post-review by visiting IDA missions.&#13;
D. Disbursement&#13;
3.18        The IDA Credit/IFAD Loan would be disbursed in accordance with Table 3.5&#13;
below.&#13;

Proj ect completion is expected by December 31, 2001, and Credit closing by June 30, 2002 (see&#13;
Annex 17). All requests for disbursements would be prepared by WDCs and reflect the&#13;
implementation schedule specified in the Annual Action Plans. Incremental staff costs to be&#13;
disbursed would apply to DWCD and WDCs. Disbursement for civil works packages exceeding&#13;
US$ 100,000 equivalent and for expenditures on goods and equipment under contracts exceeding&#13;
US$100,000 would be fully documented, as would disbursements for vehicles. For the&#13;
consultants this limit would be US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. For all&#13;
other expenditures, IDA/IFAD funds would be disbursed against statements of expenditures&#13;
(SOEs) in an agreed format and in accordance with IDA's normal procedures for SOEs. SOEs&#13;
would be certified by GOI as representing eligible project expenditures. Supporting documents&#13;
for SOEs would be available for post-review by supervision missions and auditors, and retained&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
by WDCs for one year after IDA/IFAD receipt of the audit report for the fiscal year in which the&#13;
last withdrawal from the Credit account was made. The procedures for preparing SOEs would&#13;
be: project expenses summarized monthly by WDCs and put under expense headings agreed with&#13;
IDA, certified by the authorized officer and forwarded to the Controller of Aid Accounts and&#13;
Audit at DEA within 30 days of each month-end.&#13;
3.20        Retroactive Financing and Special Account. To assist with project preparation&#13;
activities and to expedite project start-up, IDA/IFAD would finance project costs incurred after&#13;
June 30, 1996 and prior to signing of the Credit/Loan agreement up to a limit of US$2.0 million&#13;
(US$ 1.0 million each from IDA and IFAD representing about 5% of the Credit/Loan), provided&#13;
IDA procurement procedures were followed. The activities to be covered by retroactive&#13;
financing would include: (a) purchase of foods; (b) engagement of NGOs and formation of&#13;
SHGs; (c) training; and (d) incremental staff. The retroactive financing facility is being provided&#13;
as the funds available under the PPF advance (para. 1.26) are inadequate to finance all pre-&#13;
project activities. In order to facilitate timely payments of project expenditures, a Special&#13;
Account amounting to US$2.0 million (US$1.0 million each from IDA and IFAD; equivalent to&#13;
about four months expenditure) would be established by IDA in the Reserve Bank of India. The&#13;
account would be replenished quarterly or when the account is drawn down to about 50 percent&#13;
of the initial deposit, whichever occurs first.&#13;
E. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.21        Project expenditures incurred by each participating department and agency would&#13;
be subject to normal GOI and state accounting procedures and controls. Project accounts would&#13;
summarize project expenditures under categories to be agreed with IDA/IFAD showing: (a)&#13;
actual versus planned expenditures for each month; (b) actual versus planned expenditures&#13;
accumulated to date; and (c) how financed for the quarter and accumulated, by the Association&#13;
and by the government. The summaries which would provide information for the SOEs would&#13;
form part of the project accounts, including those expenditures for which reimbursement would&#13;
be claimed with full documentation. The project accounts would be supported by a listing with&#13;
the withdrawal applications submitted for the period. The Controller and Auditor General and&#13;
his Accountant Generals at the state level would be considered acceptable auditors, and the&#13;
audited project accounts and SOEs along with the auditor's reports would be submitted annually,&#13;
to be received by the Association no later than six months after the end of the fiscal year. The&#13;
Audit Report on SOEs would specifically comment on their usage and the controls established to&#13;
ensure their accuracy. The Special Account, which would be maintained by the Department of&#13;
Economic Affairs (DEA), would show all withdrawal requests disbursed, amounts advanced and&#13;
reimbursed by IDA/IFAD, and balance at the end of each accounting period. The Controller and&#13;
Auditor General would be acceptable auditors and reports would reflect the certification of the&#13;
balance held by the Reserve Bank of India. The Audited Special Account and the auditors report&#13;
thereon would be submitted annually to reach IDA/IFAD no later than six months after the end&#13;
of each fiscal year. Each WDC would prepare a project report on a quarterly basis in a format to&#13;
be agreed with IDA/IFAD, summarizing project progress in physical terms linked to financial&#13;
terms. The financial terms would be based on the quarterly unaudited project accounts required&#13;
above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING&#13;
A. Organization and Management&#13;
4.01        Executing Agencies. The Department of Women and Child Development,&#13;
Ministry of Human Resource Development, GOI (DWCD) would be the overall coordinating&#13;
agency for the project. DWCD has obtained the necessary GOI clearances for the project to be a&#13;
Centrally-sponsored project. Within the states, the nodal agency would be the Department of&#13;
Women and Child Development in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh; the Department&#13;
of Social Welfare in Bihar and Haryana; and the Department of Industries and Mines in Gujarat.&#13;
The Women's Development Corporations would be the executing agencies. In Uttar Pradesh the&#13;
U.P. Land Development Corporation would be sub-contracted by the UP Women's Welfare&#13;
Corporation to assist in implementation in 13 of the proposed 15 project districts.&#13;
4.02        Other Implementing Agencies. NGOs would have the major responsibility to&#13;
form and sustain SHGs (see para 2.17(i)(e) and 4.08). Due to the multi-sectoral nature of the&#13;
project, many of its activities would be implemented or back-stopped by cooperating institutions.&#13;
In addition, private and public sector technical, design and marketing agencies would assist in the&#13;
implementation of project activities, working under contractual arrangements with the WDCs. A&#13;
list of agencies expected to assist with project implementation is given in Annex 8 for on-farm&#13;
activities, and Annex 9 for non-farm activities.&#13;
4.03        Organizational Responsibilities. Project management would use and build upon&#13;
existing government and NGO structures, modifying them where necessary to ensure adequate&#13;
capacity to implement the project. Within DWCD, the lead responsibility for supporting the project&#13;
would be given to an existing Joint Secretary, who would be assisted by a Central Project Support&#13;
Unit (CPSU). In its role as the central coordinating agency, the CPSU would help to maintain and&#13;
strengthen the decentralized nature of the project. To this end, its main functions would be to assist&#13;
with capacity building in the participating states; to facilitate exchange of experience among the&#13;
states and between them and relevant national and international women's programs; and to monitor&#13;
performance of the project.&#13;
4.04        Within the states, the WDCs would be responsible for promoting, guiding,&#13;
coordinating and monitoring project implementation. Overall responsibility for project execution&#13;
would be vested in the Managing Director of the WDC. Project management would be integrated&#13;
into the regular structure and functioning of the WDC, and would be modified as required to allow&#13;
for the establishment of administrative, finance, marketing and training cells. WDCs would have a&#13;
district implementing unit located in each project district. The only exception would be Bihar&#13;
where participating NGOs would establish such units (see para. 2.2 (i)). A detailed description of&#13;
the proposed staffing and functions of the CPSU and WDCs, and Terms of Reference for the key&#13;
staff are given in Annex 11.&#13;
4.05        Banks would provide credit to SHGs through group loans to enable SHG members&#13;
to engage in income generating activities. Private sector agencies would provide technical services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
(design, production technology, marketing) for the non-farm income generating activities selected&#13;
and managed by the women. Line departments and other research and technology organizations&#13;
would be the main source of technical advice for on-farm income generating activities, and for&#13;
identifying and promoting appropriate labor saving technologies. An experienced management&#13;
institute would assist in developing the conceptual framework for the M&amp;E system, including the&#13;
CPM and MIS systems. Experienced M&amp;E agencies in each state would carry out the monitoring&#13;
and evaluation and train the WDCs in the operation of the CPM and MIS. Annex 11 Attachment 2&#13;
gives more information on the specific responsibilities of the various participating agencies in&#13;
relation to key project activities.&#13;
4.06         Coordination Committees. A State Project Steering Committee (SPSC) would be&#13;
established, chaired by the Chief Secretary9 (or her/his nominee) and comprising experts drawn&#13;
from official and non-official sources, including the partner NGOs and others with established&#13;
reputations of working on women's issues or with technical expertise relevant to project&#13;
implementation, e.g., micro-credit, micro-enterprise development, or appropriate rural technology.&#13;
The role of the SPSC would be to provide overall guidance and support during project&#13;
implementation and to enable the project to benefit from the knowledge and experience of outside&#13;
experts to improve project design in the course of implementation. The SPSC would establish&#13;
I0&#13;
expert groups  as required to advise on specific aspects of the project e.g. the selection and&#13;
capacity building of NGOs for implementation of project activities. The SPSC would be&#13;
supported by a State Project Working Group (SPWG) chaired by the Secretary of the nodal&#13;
department, to deal with operational details of coordination for effective project implementation.&#13;
At the district level, linkages with the line departments and other support service providers would&#13;
be achieved through a District Project Coordination Committee (DPCC) chaired by the District&#13;
Magistrate (or her/his nominee). A Cluster Level Working Group (CLWG) would be established&#13;
for a cluster of around 20 villages comprising SHG and NGO representatives, line department&#13;
officials, bank managers and elected representatives. The main functions of the CLWG would be&#13;
to: provide a forum for regular interaction between beneficiaries and project implementors to ensure&#13;
the responsiveness of the project to the expressed needs of the beneficiaries; facilitate provision of&#13;
the necessary support for the groups' economic and social activities; and establish linkages between&#13;
the SHGs and the service providers required to sustain and further the development of SHG&#13;
members in the long term. The SPSC, SPWG and DPCCs for the phase I districts have been&#13;
established in all the states.&#13;
B. Project Implementation&#13;
4.07         Project Phasing in Relation to Implementation Capacity and Performance..&#13;
Given the limited implementation capacity of WDCs and the need to orient intervenors to the&#13;
project concept, pre-project activities are being undertaken during the six months prior to project&#13;
effectiveness (see para 1.26). At the beginning of the main project, with the exception of districts&#13;
under the management of UPLDC (para 2.07), activities in each state would be limited to one or&#13;
9  In Uttar Pradesh, the SPSC would be chaired by the Agricultural Production Commissioner.&#13;
10 Including experts from outside the state, if necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
two districts and expanded in a phased manner in keeping with increasing implementation capacity&#13;
of WDCs and NGOs. The readiness of each state to expand the program would be based on the&#13;
feed-back received from the concurrent M&amp;E processes (see also para. 4.26). The key&#13;
considerations would include: (i) overall perfonnance of WDCs in coordinating project&#13;
implementation; (ii) availability of trained WDC staff in new area to be brought under the project;&#13;
(iii) availability of strong NGOs, and their ability to form functional SHGs using the agreed project&#13;
concepts; and (iv) economic and social progress made by SHGs formed in the initial districts. At&#13;
mid-term review, project funds would be reallocated from poorly performing states to those making&#13;
good progress.&#13;
4.08        NGO Participation. NGOs would form SHGs and provide support to each group&#13;
over a four year period. NGOs with experience of working with women's groups have already&#13;
been identified to initiate the work in the pre-project and phase I districts. To ensure the selection&#13;
of experienced NGOs for subsequent districts, the WDCs would be helped by experienced NGOs to&#13;
identify local NGOs with the appropriate orientation to participate in project implementation.&#13;
NGOs selected to work in tribal areas would be familiar with the specific tribal situations of the&#13;
project districts and have prior experience of working with tribal communities. It is expected&#13;
that the nature of the NGOs' involvement would change over time. Initially, an NGO would be&#13;
mainly involved in SHG formation and, assist them to establish procedures for the management&#13;
of group affairs, especially savings and credit operations. Thereafter, as the focus of the SHG&#13;
moves to income generating activities, the role of the NGO would also change to facilitating&#13;
linkages with banks and ensuring access to the necessary technical support services for these&#13;
activities. If required, resource NGOs would also assist in orienting WDC, bank and line&#13;
department staff to the SHG approach, and training them in participatory management practices.&#13;
The WDCs have signed agreements with NGOs identified to work in the phase I districts in all&#13;
states.&#13;
4.09        Strategy for Areas without NGOs. In areas without NGOs, the WDC assisted by&#13;
experienced NGOs would identify socially motivated persons (e.g., field workers from the total&#13;
literacy campaigns) about 6 months in advance of commencement of work. After an initial&#13;
period of training, these persons would work with the experienced NGOs to gain practical field&#13;
experience for about 6 months before returning to their "home" areas to start forming SHGs.&#13;
During the first year of their independent operation, the experienced NGO would continue to&#13;
supervise and support their work. In time, it is expected that these workers would be able to&#13;
work independently like other small NGOs. An alternative approach to be piloted by the&#13;
Haryana WDC would foster the formation of a registered society to be managed by selected field&#13;
workers within the community. After training in the project concept and approach, the members&#13;
of this society would take on the responsibility of forming SHGs, under the overall guidance of&#13;
the DPCC and the WDC. It is also planned that during the later years of the project, possibly Year&#13;
4, mature SHGs (individually or through clusters/associations) would begin to take responsibility&#13;
for some of the functions initially performed by NGOs and other agencies, e.g., group formation,&#13;
marketing linkages (see Annex 6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
C. Beneficiary Participation&#13;
4.10        Project preparation has involved a wide range of stakeholders, and the project&#13;
design has been finalized after intensive consultations during pre-appraisal and appraisal.&#13;
Further, given the project concept and approach, the implementation of all activities is founded&#13;
on participatory processes (Annex 10). The exact contents of the project and pace of&#13;
implementation of its program would be driven by SHG members and NGOs working with them.&#13;
The SHG members would frame the operating procedures for the group, manage the credit&#13;
operations and define the overall agenda of the group. Investments in community assets would&#13;
be made on the basis of priorities identified in consultation with communities, and&#13;
operationalized through the preparation of proposal by the NGO using a consultative process.&#13;
SHGs would be involved in the concurrent M&amp;E system and in the later years of the project,&#13;
would get involved in the formation of new groups (Annex 6). These participatory processes&#13;
would ensure that the special needs of all groups, including tribal women, are expressed and&#13;
addressed by the project.&#13;
D. Credit Financing and Lending Terms&#13;
4.11        Loans provided by the banks to SHGs would be based on the bank's assessment&#13;
of the creditworthiness of the group and its track record of credit management. The lending&#13;
institutions would be encouraged to provide cash credit arrangements for SHGs. This facility,&#13;
although an established banking practice, has seldom been used to help SHGs but has been&#13;
utilized successfully by a large number of groups formed under the UP Sodic Lands Reclamation&#13;
Project. As the SHG progresses to more productive investments, it may request a term loan if&#13;
more appropriate. SHGs would pay the prevailing inaterest rate to the lending institutions. The&#13;
bank would determine the repayment period and schedule for the group loan in consultation with&#13;
the SHG. Any policy changes resulting from the Bank's on-going dialogue with GOI on the&#13;
Rural Financial Sector Reform Program which are relevant to this project would be made&#13;
applicable to it's credit activities. Loans provided to the SHGs would be on-lent to SHG&#13;
members in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the SHG members. Interest&#13;
rates charged by existing SHGs are typically 2-3 percent per month.&#13;
E. Training&#13;
4.12        Given the strong emphasis on capacity building, support for a comprehensive&#13;
training program is a key activity under the project. The training inputs would be related to the&#13;
evolution of SHGs and their activities as well as to the needs of intervenors. Early in Year 1 of&#13;
the project, the WDCs would prepare an inventory of resource institutions/persons available to&#13;
assist in meeting the project's training needs in their state. Networking with specialized training&#13;
institutions and individuals, and the WDCs in the other participating states, would be&#13;
encouraged. At the same time, the CPSU would work with the lead institution identified to&#13;
organize a workshop to help the participating states to develop a training strategy and a broad&#13;
plan to meet their individual needs. This training plan would identify modules for each type of&#13;
training and would include information on the duration, location and agency responsible for&#13;
providing the training. Based on this plan, each state WDC would prepare an annual training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
schedule to be updated regularly on the basis of feedback from the concurrent M&amp;E findings.&#13;
The WDC Training Coordinator would plan and coordinate the implementation of the training&#13;
plan.&#13;
4.13        Based on the experience of other SHG programs, the focus during the initial 6-12&#13;
months of the project (start-up and early part of build-up phases) is expected to be on the WDC&#13;
staff, NGOs and the SHGs in aspects related to SHG formation, participatory processes, thrift,&#13;
credit and money management. In addition, during this period, training needs of banks and other&#13;
line departments would also be supported with gender sensitization and communications&#13;
modules receiving special attention. From the second to third year onwards (build-up to&#13;
stabilization phases), the need for production and business development skills for SHG members&#13;
to take up income generating activities would begin to emerge. The scope and intensity of the&#13;
training program for these phases would be determined by the menu of options identified by the&#13;
studies to be carried out under the project in support of income generation activities. (see&#13;
Annexes 8 and 9). In sequencing training activities, further information on the approach and&#13;
indicative areas of training for the participating agencies is given in Annex 12. Prior to&#13;
Negotiations, the CPSU identified the lead training institution, viz. the National Institute of&#13;
Public Cooperation and Child Development, to assist the participating states with developing a&#13;
training strategy and a broad plan.&#13;
F. Information, Communications and Learning from Experience&#13;
4.14        The process-oriented nature of the project calls for considerable support to be&#13;
provided to its activities through information and communications efforts. Messages to be&#13;
promoted would evolve in line with the progress of project implementation, focusing initially on&#13;
promotion of the SHG concept and their role. A linkage would be created between the M&amp;E&#13;
system and the communications efforts so that the latter could address key issues in project&#13;
implementation as they arise. The Information Officer in each WDC would take responsibility&#13;
for identifying and liaising with agencies that could develop appropriate communications&#13;
materials. Existing communications materials would be screened and evaluated for their&#13;
suitability before new materials were commissioned. The communications strategy would&#13;
encompass a range of activities and media, including production of printed material and films.&#13;
The WDCs would produce a monthly newsletter focusing on issues, ideas and programs&#13;
developed in each state to be distributed within the state to NGOs, SHGs and other project&#13;
implementors and shared with other participating states. Further details on the information and&#13;
communications strategy for the project are given in Annex 13.&#13;
4.15        Learning from Implementation Experience. The multi-state nature of the&#13;
project provides the opportunity for states to share information with each other based on&#13;
implementation experience. The project design allows for vigorous informal networking and&#13;
inter-state workshops to be hosted by the states in rotation. Each workshop would focus on a&#13;
particular theme in which the organizing state has particular expertise and/or experience to&#13;
demonstrate. To benefit from the accumulated experience under the Sodic Lands Reclamation&#13;
Project, the first inter-state workshop would be organized by the U.P. WWC at Lucknow, U.P.&#13;
to coincide with the project launch. The theme and location of subsequent workshops would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
decided by the participating agencies during inter-state meetings. Within a state, annual review&#13;
workshops would be held at the state and district levels to provide for a project beneficiaries and&#13;
implementors to jointly review project perfornance.&#13;
G. Project Planning and Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.16        An experienced lead agency would be hired by the CPSU to develop a&#13;
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system for the project, including design of the CPM and&#13;
MIS, concurrent monitoring and evaluation processes, and impact evaluation. This system would&#13;
be used by all the participating states who would hire an independent M&amp;E agency initially to&#13;
operate the CPMI/MIS and to undertake the concurrent monitoring and evaluation. In addition to&#13;
designing the system, the lead agency would be responsible for transferring it to the project states,&#13;
adapting it to their specific needs and overseeing its implementation. In addition, the lead agency&#13;
would organize the base line survey and undertake the impact evaluation. The state M&amp;E agencies&#13;
would train the WDCs in the operation of the CPM and MIS systems so that they are gradually able&#13;
to take over the monitoring role in support of project management. At Negotiations, the&#13;
government provided assurances that DWCD would maintain policies and procedures appropriate&#13;
to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the project on an on-going basis, and the&#13;
achievement of its objectives in accordance with indicators agreed with IDA.&#13;
4.17        Computerized Project Management System (CPM). Given the process oriented&#13;
nature of the project it would not always be possible to schedule project activities along a critical&#13;
path much in advance of implementation. Nevertheless, in view of the involvement of a number of&#13;
agencies in project implementation, and the need to introduce adjustments regularly based on&#13;
implementation experience, the project would establish a CPM system to assist with planning and&#13;
timely execution of project activities. The CPM would have a detailed work breakdown structure&#13;
in which tasks would be scheduled over the life of the project and grouped according to the various&#13;
participating agencies that would be responsible for implementing them. Each of these agencies&#13;
would be involved in determining the likely implementation schedule. The CPM would permit&#13;
milestones and targets to be established for each of the project tasks in terms of work completed,&#13;
disbursements, or time expended. Real progress would be tracked against projected progress and&#13;
delays and bottlenecks identified promptly.&#13;
4.18        Annual Action Plans. Action plans would be developed from the CPM. These&#13;
would be adjusted as required to reflect actual field experience and progress as indicated by the&#13;
concurrent monitoring and evaluation and by the proceedings of annual reviews and workshops.&#13;
These plans would provide details of all the tasks to be undertaken during the year including&#13;
timing, manpower and financial resources and expected outcomes. To ensure that the project&#13;
remains responsive to the needs of SHG members, the Annual Action Plans would be revised in&#13;
mid-year in the light of specific requests for assistance expressed by the SHGs. Prior to&#13;
Negotiations, the CPSU and WDCs would prepare Action Plans for 3 months (January-March&#13;
1997) and for the Indian fiscal year 1997-98 (ending March 31, 1998). At Negotiations, the&#13;
government provided assurances that starting on January 31, 1998, (a) DWCD would provide to&#13;
IDA and IFAD, for review and conunent, a copy of the CPSU Annual Action Plan for the&#13;
following Indian fiscal year; and (b) WDCs would provide to DWCD, IDA and IFAD for review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
and comments, an Annual Action Plan for the following Indian fiscal year prior to approval by the&#13;
WDC Board and the nodal Department.&#13;
4.19        Management Information System (MIS). The computerised MIS would provide&#13;
the data base for monitoring project performance and the essential inputs for the CPM. It will&#13;
enable quick and timely identification of groups facing unsatisfactory savings, lending and&#13;
repayment rates at the field level, as well as other information on group functioning and&#13;
sustainability. It will also, on a regular basis, evaluate the overall financial performance of the&#13;
project and monitor its evolution. In addition, it would provide information to the CPM on a&#13;
continuing basis on problems in the availability of resources required to implement the project and&#13;
thereby assist in avoiding significant delays in implementation.&#13;
4.20        Concurrent Monitoring &amp; Evaluation. The prime task of the state monitoring&#13;
teams would be to visit the field and interview the staff of the various implementing agencies and&#13;
beneficiaries to develop an objective view of the progress that is being made, problems and&#13;
constraints confronted, and whether or not the project goals are being achieved. Participatory&#13;
monitoring and evaluation methods would be used so that SHG members can assess their own&#13;
progress, e.g., in group functioning, in tracking the impacts of their actions in the family, group&#13;
and community, and revise their strategies accordingly. The implementing NGOs would be&#13;
instrumental in guiding the SHGs in these processes. Concurrent monitoring would be carried out&#13;
every quarter and a monitoring report issued following every assessment. These reports would be&#13;
discussed with senior WDC staff and World Bank supervision missions. The lead agency would&#13;
review the monitoring reports from the participating states on a six-monthly basis to enable inter-&#13;
state comparisons of project performance and to ensure consistency of measurement of the various&#13;
indicators. These reports would be sent to the CPSU and shared with IDA and IFAD. Where&#13;
necessary, more detailed studies on specific aspects of project implementation would also be&#13;
undertaken.&#13;
4.21        Impact Evaluation. This would be undertaken by the lead agency, drawing on&#13;
state level resources as required. The impact assessment exercise would involve: (a) collection&#13;
of baseline data on a sample of SHG members representative of the different socio-economic and&#13;
ecological situations in the states, together with collection of data on a control group; (b)&#13;
development of participatory impact evaluation mechanisms involving the beneficiaries; (c)&#13;
periodic field surveys to determine the impact of project activities on the beneficiaries' quality of&#13;
life and their perceptions on the adequacy of project design, and the effectiveness of project&#13;
implementation; (d) annual review workshops involving beneficiaries; and (e) studies on specific&#13;
aspects of project impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
H. Project Performance Review&#13;
4.22        Reporting. The WDCs would be responsible for internal reporting requirements.&#13;
They would submit quarterly and annual reports to DWCD and IDA and IFAD on the project's&#13;
implementation progress. Similarly, CPSU (DWCD) would produce quarterly and annual&#13;
progress reports on activities being coordinated directly by the center. Additionally, CPSU&#13;
(DWCD) would be responsible for an annual consolidated progress report synthesizing&#13;
information on the whole project, especially reports of the lead M&amp;E agency and submit these to&#13;
IDA and IFAD within thirty days of the end of the reporting period. A suggested Table of&#13;
Contents for the quarterly and annual reports is given in Annex 16, Attachment 1. At&#13;
Negotiations, the government provided assurances that starting from April 30, 1997: (i)&#13;
quarterly and annual reports would be submitted by WDCs and CPSU to IDA and IFAD; and (ii)&#13;
starting April 30, 1998, an annual reports synthesizing overall project progress would be&#13;
submitted by CPSU (DWCD) to IDA and IFAD within thirty days of the end of the reporting&#13;
period setting out the measures recommended to ensure efficient implementation of the project.&#13;
4.23        Mid-Term Review. By September 30, 1999, GOI, the States and IDA and IFAD&#13;
would jointly carry out a detailed Mid-Term Review of the project. The review would focus on&#13;
the quality of group formation; performance of SHG credit operations, particularly on repayment&#13;
performance, uses of credit, linkages with lending institutions and sizes of loans received;&#13;
performance of NGOs in forming and supporting the groups; uptake of income generating&#13;
activities and the adequacy of support provided to the SHG members, for on-farm and non-farm&#13;
activities; and progress with the social programs and community assets creation, including types&#13;
of investments requested and suitability of the implementation arrangements. A detailed&#13;
assessment of the performance of the project's M&amp;E system would also be undertaken as part of&#13;
the Mid-Term Review. Various studies would be undertaken prior to the Mid-Term Review to&#13;
facilitate these processes. At Negotiations, the government provided assurances that by&#13;
September 1999, GOI (DWCD) and state governments (WDCs) jointly with IDA and IFAD&#13;
would undertake a Mid-Term Review of the project and agree on an action plan to implement its&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
4.24        Completion Report. A project completion report would be prepared by the&#13;
WDCs using Bank guidelines and submitted to IDA and IFAD within six months of the closing&#13;
date of the IDA Credit and IFAD loan.&#13;
I. Project Supervision and Performance Indicators&#13;
4.25        Project Supervision. The project supervision strategy would put strong emphasis&#13;
on learning from implementation experience and, if appropriate, to modify project&#13;
design/implementation approaches. This would require intensive supervision, especially during&#13;
the early years of the project. Responsibility for mandatory supervision would be shared&#13;
between the CPSU, WDCs and IDA. IFAD would join IDA supervision missions at regular&#13;
intervals. The management and concurrent monitoring and evaluation systems, including MIS&#13;
and CPM, and reviews, special studies and reporting procedures proposed for the project would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
provide valuable inputs for effective supervision. In addition, participating NGOs, operating at&#13;
the grassroots level, would assist by providing feedback to other project implementors, especially&#13;
WDCs, on the views of SHG members on the performance of project activities. The project's&#13;
supervision would also benefit from interactions between IDA and the members of the UN Inter-&#13;
Agency Working Group (IAWG). This group meets in Delhi regularly to coordinate activities&#13;
and share experiences, and is also extended to include representatives of bilateral donors who&#13;
have on-going gender related activities. DWCD and WDCs and IDA supervision missions&#13;
would liaise with implementors of bilateral projects to share experiences and coordinate efforts&#13;
where appropriate. More information on supervision plan is given in Annex 16.&#13;
4.26        Performance Indicators. The impact of institutional strengthening would be&#13;
expressed through sustainability of SHG activities, especially those related to financial aspects&#13;
and the effectiveness of the support provided by the intervenors (WDCs, NGOs and line&#13;
departments). Support for women-managed income-generating activities would be expressed&#13;
through credit mobilization and its utilization pattern and income/resource control by women;&#13;
social investments would be expressed in percentages of members (and family members)&#13;
accessing health and education services and patters of time utilization; and strengthening project&#13;
management systems would be expressed in the overall performance of the project and&#13;
assessment of welfare/ empowerment related outcomes for women. A detailed matrix showing&#13;
expected outcomes and impacts of various inputs in relation to project objectives is given below.&#13;

V. PROJECT IMPACTS AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. Production and Marketing&#13;
5.01            Production. Since the project is not a conventional production oriented project, it&#13;
is not possible to quantify the aggregate incremental production. However, an indication can be&#13;
given of the production increases likely to accrue from some of the activities which the women&#13;
are likely to take up. For typical rainfed crops, per hectare production is expected to increase&#13;
from 0.48 mt to 0.8 mt for sorghum; from 0.12 mt to 0.3 mt for pulses and from 0.5 mt to 0.9 mt&#13;
for chillies, whilst for irrigated crops, per hectare production is expected to increase from 1.8 mt&#13;
to 3.5 mt for paddy and from 0.8 mt to 2.0 mt for wheat.&#13;
5.02            Marketing. Agricultural products would be sold principally on local markets. At&#13;
present, target group households are open to exploitation by traders on whom they depend for&#13;
credit. With loans available through the SHGs, women would be freed from these tied&#13;
arrangements. They would also be encouraged to use loans available to delay sale of crops beyond&#13;
the immediate post-harvest period when prices are depressed, and thus would benefit from the&#13;
higher prices prevailing at other times. In addition, WDC district staff and NGOs would encourage&#13;
women to form inter-SHG commodity groups/producers associations which would facilitate group&#13;
marketing and increase their bargaining power with traders.&#13;
5.03            Marketing of the products of non-farm enterprises has posed major problems in&#13;
the past. Under the project, the situation would be improved through extensive market surveys to&#13;
identify those products with genuine market potential, and to identify market outlets. Marketing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-&#13;
consultants will also be engaged to assist the women to establish linkages with the market outlets&#13;
and negotiate suitable contracts.&#13;
B. Project Benefits&#13;
5.04        Immediate benefits would be seen in: (a) the creation of women's self-help groups&#13;
and their ability to control income and their own development; (b) enhanced involvement of&#13;
women in economic activities due to improved access to funds from their own savings and&#13;
integration into mainstream credit delivery mechanisms; (c) improved management and technical&#13;
skills; (d) improvements in women's health and reduction of their drudgery; and (f)&#13;
strengthening of key support agencies enabling them to be more effective in addressing women's&#13;
needs. Longer term benefits for women would include: (i) increased self-reliance and self-&#13;
confidence to address their constraints and increased ability to mobilize various public and&#13;
private sector services for their benefit; and (ii) improvement in their social status in the family&#13;
and community. It is estimated that the project would assist in the formation of about 7,400&#13;
groups benefiting around 130,000 women.&#13;
C. Economic and Financial Analysis&#13;
5.05        Economic Analysis. Given the multi-faceted nature of the project, many of the&#13;
benefits are not readily quantifiable. The quantifiable benefits relate to project support to&#13;
increase women's involvement in income generating activities. However, given the flexibility in&#13;
the credit mechanism and the freedom of choice to be exercised by women in the selection of&#13;
economic activities, quantification of these benefits involves a high degree of approximation&#13;
based on assumptions on the proportion of loans given for consumption, social or productive&#13;
purposes; the rotation of investment funds; and the extent to which project loans replace existing,&#13;
more expensive sources of credit from the informal sector. Data from the experience of existing&#13;
SHGs have been used to derive a set of assumptions for the analysis. The analysis assumes: (a)&#13;
that a range of income generating activities is likely to be taken up by women, with a mix of 85&#13;
percent on-farm and 15 percent non-farm activities; (b) the percentage of lending from the group&#13;
which generates incremental economic benefits would increase from 15 to 40 percent as the&#13;
group matures; and (c) the rotation of investment funds decreases from 2.0 to 1.5 times per year.&#13;
All the project costs for direct support to income generating activities have been included in the&#13;
analysis and it is further assumed that 50 percent of the costs of capacity building of the groups&#13;
and project implementors, including project management, have a direct impact on the&#13;
involvement of women in income generating activities. Other assumptions applicable to analysis&#13;
are:&#13;
(a)   all costs and benefits are in constant June 1996 prices;&#13;
(b)   reference prices for main crops and fertilizers are based on estimated world&#13;
reference prices adjusted to average project area farm gate values;&#13;
(c)   for other commodities not internationally traded financial prices are adjusted by&#13;
the Standard Conversion Factor used for India of 0.9;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
(d)    project costs and benefits streams are extended over 10 years;&#13;
(e)    opportunity cost of capital is 12%; and&#13;
(f)    project implementation is over five years.&#13;
On this basis the project yields an economic rate of return of 25 percent and net present value of&#13;
US$7.8 million.&#13;
5.06          Sensitivity analysis. The project is more sensitive to the performance of&#13;
investment activities taken up than to variations in the overall pattern of lending, as shown by the&#13;
results of the sensitivity analysis given below:&#13;
EIRR (°i)         NPV&#13;
Rs. million&#13;
Base case                                              25              335&#13;
Benefits decrease by 10%                               12             (10)&#13;
Activity costs increase by 10%                         15              70&#13;
Support costs increase by 10%                          23              288&#13;
Max. 50% of funds generate increm econ benefits        26              367&#13;
Max 30% of funds generate increm econ benefits         21              196&#13;
1 year lag in investment activities                    19              100&#13;
5.07          Switching values indicate that project benefits could decrease by 10 percent for&#13;
the NPV to fall to zero, whilst the costs of the income generating activities could increase by 13&#13;
percent and the percentage of funds generating incremental benefits could fall to 20 percent.&#13;
Further details on the economic analysis are given in Annex 18.&#13;
5.08          The other aspects of the project do not lend themselves to quantitative analysis.&#13;
The principal benefits of the capacity building of groups lie in providing a basis for mutual&#13;
support which would enable women to manage their own affairs in a more self-reliant manner,&#13;
and a framework for more cost effective delivery of financial and technical services. The project&#13;
contributes to building a pool of creditworthy clients for banks and in so doing reduces the risks&#13;
of the banking system in lending to the rural poor. It is expected that working with groups with a&#13;
high degree of credit discipline would bring significant economic benefits by increasing recovery&#13;
rates from around 30-50 percent under individual-based poverty alleviation programs to more&#13;
than 90 percent through lending to SHGs. The reduction in the default risk also contributes&#13;
significantly to reducing the overall transaction costs of the banks from around 35 percent when&#13;
lending to individuals to around 11 percent for lending to SHGs. I I&#13;

5.09        The investment in capacity building of the WDCs would enable them to be more&#13;
effective in implementing programs for the economic and social advancement of women.&#13;
Strengthening the capacity of NGOs would create by the end of the project, a group of NGOs&#13;
oriented and experienced in the SHG concept and the role that SHGs can play in assisting&#13;
women's development and empowerment. Capacity building of the other support agencies&#13;
would make them more aware of women's priorities and more responsive to women's specific&#13;
needs. The social activities would contribute to improving women's well-being and overall&#13;
quality of life through improved access to health services and labor saving facilities, thereby&#13;
reducing drudgery, releasing timne for more productive activities, and increasing productivity.&#13;
5.10        The average direct cost per beneficiary is estimated at around US$240 of which&#13;
US$75 represents direct social intermediation costs (capacity building of groups); US$70&#13;
represents technical support for income generating activities and US$95 represents investment&#13;
funds. The social intermediation costs represent investment in capacity-building at the group&#13;
level, including credit management and accounting, and developing the groups' sense of&#13;
ownership which are crucial steps towards sustainability. The remaining project expenditure&#13;
(around 40 percent of the total) would be on institutional strengthening of the NGOs, WDCs and&#13;
other project implementors, and on social programs which would provide benefits to a much&#13;
wider clientele than the immediate project beneficiaries.&#13;
5.11        Financial Analysis. Financial models have been prepared for an indicative&#13;
selection of on-farm and non-farm activities likely to be taken up by women. Increases in&#13;
incomes from the activities likely to be taken up are variable as these include both supplementary&#13;
and full-time activities, but they generally exceed Rs. 4,000 per annum, making a substantial&#13;
contribution to poverty alleviation. These activities yield incremental benefit: cost ratios in&#13;
excess of 1.5, and provide a return per person-day in excess of Rs. 30 compared with the average&#13;
wage for women in agricultural labor which is around Rs. 20/day.&#13;
5.12        Fiscal Impact. Given the pilot nature of the project, the overall fiscal impact on&#13;
state and/or central government budgets will be negligible. The expenditures are largely for&#13;
capacity building of public and private sector agencies and investment in social capital&#13;
development. In financial terms, the project represents a very small financial burden. No&#13;
permanent incremental staff would be added to the establishment:of the implementing agencies&#13;
as they would either be hired on contract or come on deputation from government departments&#13;
where their posts would be frozen. By the end of the project, SHGs would have developed the&#13;
capacity to take over many of the responsibilities from NGOs either on a group basis or through&#13;
the clusters/associationsof SHGs. The CGs/ACs may also be engaged in propagating the SHG&#13;
concept and assisting the formation of new SHGs, thereby facilitating the expansion of the SHG&#13;
program at a much reduced cost. While no specific cost recovery measures are proposed in this&#13;
initial phase of the program, opportunities for partial cost recovery of some social services would&#13;
be explored during project implementation. Experience from on-going NGO programs suggests&#13;
that SHG members are willing to pay for services which deliver tangible benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
5.13        Although the project incorporates an exit strategy for NGO support to SHGs, the&#13;
phasing of project activities means that around 60 percent of SHGs would still require assistance&#13;
beyond the project period entailing an expenditure of Rs. 28 million (US$0.8 million) over the&#13;
subsequent three years. These costs may be reduced to some extent if the process of forming&#13;
clusters and associations gathers pace and these bodies are able to provide some of the on-going&#13;
support currently provided by NGOs.&#13;
D. Social Impact&#13;
5.14        Social Assessment. Project interventions are directed towards poor women who&#13;
have not fully benefited from past interventions in economic or social programs. The project is&#13;
founded on participatory processes which would enable these women to determine their own&#13;
strategies for increasing incomes and empowerment. The findings of consultations during project&#13;
preparation have been incorporated into project planning and design and, together with the&#13;
concurrent M&amp;E would ensure continued responsiveness of the project to women's expressed&#13;
needs. More information on the social assessment process is given in Annex 10.&#13;
5.15        Indigenous People's Concerns. The proportion of tribal people in most of the 35&#13;
districts chosen for the project is low (see Annex 15). However, in some districts, e.g.,&#13;
Panchmahals (Gujarat), Ranchi (Bihar) and Betul (Madhya Pradesh), their proportion is high&#13;
(above 44 percent) thus making tribal women major potential beneficiaries of the project. The&#13;
group members would decide the nature as well as operational modalities of group activities, and&#13;
the project's approach would ensure the appropriateness of investments for tribal communities. Its&#13;
interventions for savings and credit, skills training and market linkages are even more germane to&#13;
tribal women on account of the poverty and poor resource base of tribal areas. The intermediation&#13;
of NGOs with mainstream institutions, such as financial institutions and line departments, to ensure&#13;
the provision of improved services would address some of the major constraints faced by tribal&#13;
people. Further, the approach of the project to entrust decision making powers to SHGs and&#13;
provide members with functional literacy, and communities with assets, basic health care and child&#13;
care, would fill major gaps that persist in the social services in tribal areas. More information on&#13;
the needs of tribal women is given in Annex 15. At Negotiations, the government provided&#13;
assurances that where the project is implemented in any state tribal area, each project state, in&#13;
consultation with SHG members, would develop implementation arrangements covering project's&#13;
activities satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
E. Environmental Impact&#13;
5.16        The proposed project would be unlikely to have any negative impact on the&#13;
environment. In the course of the participatory processes for selection of income generating&#13;
activities, Animal Husbandry staff would assist SHG members who are considering taking loans&#13;
for livestock to consider the crucial issue of fodder availability in the local area. Micro-enterprise&#13;
activities would be small artisan-based enterprises which will neither adversely affect the natural&#13;
resource base nor cause atmospheric pollution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
F. Sustainability&#13;
5.17        A major thrust of the project is capacity building of SHGs so that they are capable&#13;
of managing their own affairs, and are able to further their own social and economic development&#13;
by virtue of the awareness created and linkages established with lending institutions and technical&#13;
support agencies. The expected high repayment rates and reduction in transaction costs for the&#13;
banks should ensure a continuing flow of credit to the groups. The project design allocates&#13;
substantial responsibilities and resources to non-governmental entities, with 36 percent of total&#13;
project costs flowing to SHGs and 47 percent to NGOs and other contracted specialists, while&#13;
project expenditures flowing to government to improve capacity amount to only 17 percent.&#13;
Building the capacity of mature SHGs to promote the formation of additional SHGs contribute to a&#13;
more cost-effective and sustainable approach to the formation of SHGs. Through this approach, the&#13;
direct NGO support costs are estimated to reduce by around 50 percent. In addition, the formation&#13;
of clusters of SHGs and cluster associations would over time, be expected to take over many of the&#13;
support functions provided by NGOs, whilst also playing a vital role in the wider replication of the&#13;
SHG concept.&#13;
G. Risks&#13;
5.18        The proposed project carries several risks. Some are general problems associated&#13;
with implementation of projects in India including late start-up, frequent management turnover, and&#13;
weak implementation capacity. Most of these risks have been substantially reduced through project&#13;
design which places a strong emphasis on organizational capacity building, recruitment of project&#13;
management staff at senior levels on a longterm contractual basis to counter the high turnover of&#13;
government officers, recruitment of key staff as a condition of Negotiations to facilitate project&#13;
start-up, and launching of pre-project activities including hiring of NGOs, formation of SHGs, and&#13;
orientation of project implementors, to expedite project implementation and generate experience.&#13;
5.19        There are other risks specifically associated with the project. First, an adequate&#13;
number of competent NGOs may not be found to form and support SHGs, which may also result in&#13;
overloading the limited number of experienced NGOs. To address this, the project would support&#13;
capacity building of motivated NGOs which presently lack experience of SHG formation, which&#13;
would allow many small NGOs to participate. In addition, transparent contractual arrangements&#13;
with appropriate funding, specifying roles and responsibilities of public institutions, NGOs and&#13;
SHGs have been developed to provide for a supportive environment for project implementation.&#13;
5.20        Second, the WDCs may not develop adequate capacity to coordinate the project&#13;
activities effectively. Institutional strengthening of the WDCs through staffing with relevant&#13;
expertise accompanied by orientation and training of staff would be emphasized in the project to&#13;
address this risk. Phased implementation of the project would ensure that adequate training is&#13;
provided before coverage is expanded to new districts. Feedback from the concurrent M&amp;E system&#13;
would indicate the readiness of the WDCs to cope with an expanded area of operation.&#13;
5.21        Third, insufficient support may be provided by the technical line departnents to&#13;
back-up income generating activities and provide social services. The project addresses this risk&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
through a strong emphasis on building the capacity of support agencies, including gender&#13;
sensitization to encourage line departments to be more responsive to women's needs. In addition,&#13;
the participatory nature of the project and the emphasis on empowering women would make the&#13;
public services more accountable to the SHG members. Funds are available under the project to&#13;
strengthen linkages with line departments and to tap other sources of technical support where&#13;
deficiencies are experienced. An associated risk is the limited capacity within some states to&#13;
support micro-enterprises. To address this, the project would finance support from successful&#13;
private sector women entrepreneurs to help in identification and capacity building of local&#13;
entrepreneurs who are willing to assist SHG members to establish new enterprises of their own&#13;
choice and/or develop market linkages for businesses.&#13;
5.22        A fourth risk is that banks may not be as responsive as envisaged in providing loans&#13;
to the groups. The project seeks to reduce this risk through investing in strengthening of linkages&#13;
between lending institutions, NGOs and SHGs and in capacity building of the groups to establish a&#13;
track record of sound credit management to make them attractive clients for the banks.&#13;
5.23        A final risk is that the women may be constrained in generating additional income&#13;
due to difficulties in overcoming time and labor constraints. To address this, the project provides&#13;
support for activities to reduce drudgery and improve access to social services, especially health&#13;
and child care facilities.&#13;

RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED FROM TAMIL NADU WOMEN'S&#13;
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Background&#13;
1.          The Tamil Nadu Women's Development Project commenced its implementation&#13;
in 1989. The overall responsibility for project implementation lies with MAHAM (Tamil Nadu&#13;
Women's Development Corporation), which is a wholly owned Government of Tamil Nadu&#13;
undertaking. The principal objective of the project is the economic and social upliftment of&#13;
women to enhance the welfare of their families and to improve their status in the family and the&#13;
community. The objective of social advancement would be achieved through raising women's&#13;
level of awareness and fostering the confidence to strive for social change through the&#13;
development of strong, cohesive groups as a source of mutual support of the women and the&#13;
provision of an animator within the village to motivate and guide them. Improvement in their&#13;
economic position would be achieved through increasing their income eaming potential by&#13;
integrating them into the regular delivery system for credit and technical support services. In&#13;
order to overcome inadequacies in the selection of beneficiaries under existing government&#13;
programs, the project would involve NGOs in the initial screening process. The entry point and&#13;
central feature of the project was to be the fornation of savings and credit groups to meet&#13;
women's needs for crisis credit.&#13;
2.          The major innovative features introduced into the project approach included the&#13;
use of animators working at the village level to mobilize women; greater participation of women&#13;
in decision making; greater emphasis on promoting self-reliance through self-managed group&#13;
savings funds and group credit; improvement in the selection of suitable economic activities and&#13;
assistance to formal credit development.&#13;
3.          The project introduced three specific features to underpin the credit system. First,&#13;
it focused on developing the savings and loan activities of the groups to provide the small&#13;
amounts of credit for emergency, social or production purposes, which would not be available&#13;
from the banks and for which women would otherwise have recourse to money-lenders.&#13;
Secondly, it involved the participating banks in the vetting and selection of beneficiaries from the&#13;
outset thus building the confidence of the formal credit agencies in the system. Thirdly, it used&#13;
the animators and the groups themselves in deciding on the suitability of both beneficiaries and&#13;
activities thereby utilizing local knowledge of applicants and inculcating a sense of responsibility&#13;
for credit within the women's own organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 2&#13;
4.          A Mid-Term Evaluation of the project was carried out in January-February 1995&#13;
providing valuable provisional information on the impact of the project and on the lessons to be&#13;
learned from project implementation. These provide guidance for the design of the present&#13;
project.&#13;
B. Project Impact&#13;
5.          The project has shown considerable achievements. It has almost reached its&#13;
quantitative targets of loans disbursed and has overachieved by 40 percent the number of groups&#13;
to be formed. Qualitatively, there is evidence of considerable social impact of the project on&#13;
women, particularly in well functioning, homogenous groups of very poor women where women&#13;
report a greater degree of self-confidence, greater mobility and greater ease to visit banks and&#13;
converse with different officials. Landless women report a significant social change where they&#13;
were formerly laborers and are now small scale entrepreneurs as a result of obtaining loans under&#13;
the project. For other women, the most important social impact has been their ability to get out&#13;
of the house and attend group meetings, particularly where considerable opposition from their&#13;
husbands in the beginning had to be overcome.&#13;
6.          Group membership has allowed women to undertake many collective actions&#13;
ranging from petitions for street lighting to arranging for milk routes to stop in their village. The&#13;
social impact appears to have been greater in empowering women in the public rather than in the&#13;
private sphere. Women have reported feeling bolder now to go to agencies for inputs, to visit&#13;
banks and to talk with officials visiting the village. The project seems to have enabled women to&#13;
develop appropriate attitudes as well as skills and know how in dealing with external "modern"&#13;
institutions (NGOs, line agencies, banks, etc.).&#13;
7.          One of the positive features has been the kind of coordination achieved among&#13;
NGOs, banks, and line departments due to the proactive role played by the MAHAM and the&#13;
Project Implementation Units (PIUs). In addition, the bank has seen in the project a good&#13;
opportunity for developing poor rural clients and graduating them to regular bank borrowers.&#13;
8.          The strongest positive points of the project are: (a) women's groups have been&#13;
formed and the group members have been helped to develop the habit of systemic savings; (b)&#13;
the project has made it possible for unregistered self-help women's groups to open savings bank&#13;
accounts, an important achievement in itself; (c) in groups where women had the chance to take&#13;
and repay several, small, internal loans for a variety of purposes, they have been able to develop&#13;
a "repayment culture"; (d) the recovery rate of the bank loans is excellent due to the extensive&#13;
support system developed by the project. The project has demonstrated that banks can give loans&#13;
to women's self-help groups and to enjoy high repayment rates. This is important in the current&#13;
climate of market orientation and liberalization in which banking institutions are likely to shy&#13;
away from providing credit to the poor, especially poor women, because of the high transaction&#13;
costs involved and the perceived risk factor involved in repayments; and (e) the cooperation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-67-&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
between the Government, the Women's Development Corporation (WDC) and officers from the&#13;
line departments, the bank and the NGOs achieved in this project represents an important model&#13;
to be emulated.&#13;
C. Lessons Learned&#13;
Role of Intervenors&#13;
9.          Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs). The Tamil Nadu Mid-Term&#13;
Evaluation Report (MTER) highlights the key role that NGOs have played in the implementation&#13;
of the project; the quality of the group was mainly dependent on the type of orientation provided&#13;
by the NGO. It however stresses that even well qualified NGOs need to be monitored especially&#13;
with regard to the progress and quality of groups and the relevance and adequacy of training&#13;
provided. To shift the focus on "quality", the report suggests that NGOs should be paid not&#13;
exclusively on the basis of beneficiaries receiving loans as is the present practice, but also on the&#13;
number of groups trained in group dynamics and technical skills.&#13;
10.         The MTER draws attention to the variation in group quality and performance due&#13;
to the difference among NGOs in terms of philosophy, management style and experience with&#13;
credit programs. It also highlights the need to take a cautious approach to building on existing&#13;
groups which have been formed for a different purpose and to evaluate carefully how effectively&#13;
they can be modified to fit in with the project's objectives. When existing groups were&#13;
transformed into IFAD groups the members (and often the focus) did not change; as a result&#13;
several well to do women remained as members of the IFAD group, other groups were too large&#13;
to function as effective SHGs, yet others were formed into clusters without first consolidating the&#13;
SHGs at the base leading to top-down systems of management.&#13;
I1.         District Project Implementation Unit. It was originally envisaged that the&#13;
Project Coordinator would not only be a senior person but also one with experience in&#13;
participatory management, interaction with other institutions, especially with NGOs, and who is&#13;
committed to the project, open to new ideas and has confidence in other people's institutions as&#13;
part of a sustainable strategy. This has not been implemented. In addition, brief postings of one&#13;
year of officials from the main line departments, especially of those who are not happy with the&#13;
transfer, undermine the project.&#13;
12.         The MTER also stresses the need for a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) at&#13;
district level arguing that a Coordination Committee of district heads of technical departments&#13;
supported by a nodal officer cannot perform the same functions as a PIU. However, it is not&#13;
necessary for the PIU to have a large contingent of technical staff on deputation from each line&#13;
department.&#13;
13.         Technical Support. The MTER draws particular attention to the lack of support&#13;
provided by the line departments, particularly in the field of animal husbandry. This has had a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-68-&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
serious impact on a large number of people since over 45 percent of the loanees have opted for&#13;
milk animals. The report points out that several of these animals were not of good quality - one&#13;
of the reasons being that the market price of a productive animal was below the approved unit&#13;
cost (INR 10 000 versus INR 14 000); but it also highlights other reasons for which the&#13;
veterinary department involved needs to share responsibility, for example: inadequate provision&#13;
of fodder; high costs of purchasing fodder and concentrates; lack of professional advice and&#13;
training in management relating to health, feed needs and breeding; inadequate veterinary&#13;
services, usually difficult to access; the difficulty to maintain monthly repayments especially&#13;
when milk yield falls.&#13;
14.         Animators. The MTER highlights the crucial role that animators play; they have&#13;
had a strong impact on the groups. The tendency to dominate the group, however, was clearly&#13;
noticeable. The MTER emphasizes the need for training animators in participatory skills so that&#13;
they are equipped to support the emergence of other leaders within the group who in turn will be&#13;
mutually supportive. The report points out the need for the animators honorarium to be met by&#13;
the group and indicates from its study of several groups that this is feasible from the fifth year&#13;
onwards. The report indicates that animators in some areas tend to include women in the group&#13;
with whom they can relate resulting in a group where the literacy rate as well as the economic&#13;
status of members is relatively high.&#13;
15.         Banks. Only one commercial bank is involved in financing under the Tamil&#13;
Nadu project. As a result in certain areas, the presence of banks is inadequate in relation to the&#13;
number of groups resulting in an over-load on one branch and considerable inconvenience and&#13;
cost to the borrowers. It concludes that a branch finds it difficult to handle more than 50 groups&#13;
without computerizing its operations which it is estimated would cost INR 0.2 million per&#13;
branch. The MTER also highlights the elaborate procedures required for loan disbursement.&#13;
16.         The MTER recommends that the National Project should give consideration to&#13;
adopting the group lending approach using the pattern proposed under the Reserve Bank of India&#13;
circular and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development guidelines allowing banks to&#13;
finance SHGs directly as bankable institutions - no records of individual member loans need be&#13;
maintained by the bank.&#13;
Group Formation and Management&#13;
17.         The MTER states that "an important lesson learned from the Tamil Nadu project&#13;
is that one of the best indicators of the dynamism and cohesion of a group is the degree of&#13;
rotation to all members of small, internal loans based on their savings prior to applying for bank&#13;
loans. Groups which were not constrained from doing this due to local bank rules obliging them&#13;
to keep their savings as bank deposits and were able to postpone the application for bank loans&#13;
for at least a year, were able to develop a sense of self-reliance and solidarity as well as a&#13;
repayment culture. It would, therefore, be very important to ensure that in the National Project,&#13;
NGO and bank regulations are favorable in allowing groups to experience a high degree of small,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-69-&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
internal loans for a minimum of a year". The report suggests that no bank loans are to be given&#13;
until the groups have acquired the habit of regular savings credited to a common fund and&#13;
experience of revolving these savings through internal loans. It suggests that groups must have&#13;
the experience of saving and lending for at least one year before loans are provided. The practice&#13;
adopted by banks of holding the savings as a kind of collateral or risk coverage therefore must be&#13;
discontinued.&#13;
18.         The report also stresses the need for improvement in the quality of record keeping.&#13;
Most of the NGOs were not well equipped to maintain book of accounts and to audit the&#13;
common fund of the groups. They need to be provided with technical support to improve their&#13;
performance.&#13;
19.         Factors Enhancing Group Sustainability. The Review Mission found that the&#13;
following factors enhanced group solidarity and group sustainability: size - small groups less&#13;
than 25; homogeneity - similar socio-economic background; degree of rotation of the common&#13;
fund based on savings before project loans were availed of; training of animators in group&#13;
dynamics and management; quantum and rate of savings - high rate generated confidence in their&#13;
own efforts; broad spectrum of group activities to include provision of service which also&#13;
increased the common fund and supported group action.&#13;
20.         Federations. Attempts to create some kind of group federation should not be&#13;
undertaken until the groups have attained a mature level of functioning, appreciate the&#13;
importance of such federation, and are in a position to control it. The present experience&#13;
indicates that such federations should be limited to a social and information sharing role, and&#13;
refrain from playing any kind of financial role.&#13;
21.         Target Group. The MTER noted that even with well defined target group&#13;
criteria of poor women, the most disadvantaged women, namely the landless, women from&#13;
marginal farm families and female headed households, have not been adequately represented in&#13;
the groups. This has arisen partly from the tendency of the animator to select women with whom&#13;
she felt comfortable and to whom she could relate as they were literate. It has also arisen through&#13;
a misconception of the need to give emphasis to land based activities.&#13;
Training&#13;
22.         The MTER stresses that the content and quality of training differs from NGO to&#13;
NGO. It is much below the standard required in many cases and the NGOs need to be trained&#13;
particularly in: group dynamics; group management; gender and poverty issues; credit related&#13;
issues; and participatory planning skills. This service could be provided by larger experienced&#13;
NGOs and/or consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-70-&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
23.   The MTER also noted the following points with regard to training:&#13;
The Animators in many areas are given the major responsibility for conducting&#13;
training modules but they are not adequately qualified and experienced to&#13;
undertake this role. In addition, they are not equipped with adequate&#13;
communication materials. In addition, the animators require training in&#13;
participation in order to enable them to modify their own often dominating&#13;
behavior and to create a participatory environment for all women members.&#13;
Group training is most crucial for the success of the project; this includes&#13;
primarily training in group dynamics and group management and participatory&#13;
skills required for group cohesion and sustainability. A large number of women&#13;
are still passive participants in meetings; group training with a focus on the&#13;
weaker members should be given priority. An important training aid to be&#13;
developed is a video of the behaviors and interactions between women members&#13;
in a well functioning group, illustrating successful group dynamics, active&#13;
participation and democratic decision making.&#13;
Entrepreneurship training is crucial for effective management of economic&#13;
activities; it should include the basic principles of planning, management and&#13;
accounting, including cost of their own labor and profit. In addition, inadequate&#13;
training had been provided to members in relation to their income generating&#13;
activity taken up. Technical training may be drawn from technical people attached&#13;
to NGOs, by the line departments or from technical trainers retained on a&#13;
contractual basis by the project. Training in poverty and gender issues should be&#13;
extended to all project officers, member of line departments on deputation to the&#13;
PIU and bank officers at district and branch levels as well as to NGOs.&#13;
Women find it difficult to leave the village to attend training. In order to&#13;
accommodate women's work overload and multiple responsibilities, their training&#13;
should be offered at the village level and should be practical, on-the-job training,&#13;
well adjusted to women's reality.&#13;
An exercise in the identification of training needs of the collaborating NGOs is&#13;
important to be followed up by the provision of training by specially trained&#13;
trainers. Animators and supervisors should be trained in recording the number of&#13;
trained beneficiaries, the type of training provided, and the number of visits by&#13;
technical staff to the group.&#13;
All training activities and particularly the quality of training offered to all target&#13;
groups and especially to beneficiaries needs to be carefully monitored by the&#13;
project management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71-&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Economic Activities&#13;
24.         The MTER stressed the need to diversify the profitable productive activities for&#13;
which loans are available to women in order to increase women's awareness and empowerment.&#13;
This diversification, however, needs to be based on the results of good market research&#13;
undertaken in different localities of project concentration. Market research capability should be&#13;
accessed on a contractual basis.&#13;
25.         The MTER also noted that the direct subsidies provided to the beneficiaries as a&#13;
bonus after loan repayment do not constitute a significant motive for members of well&#13;
functioning groups. On the contrary, they may be creating expectations for future subsidies that&#13;
cannot be fulfilled. The MTER observed that many members were willing to borrow even&#13;
without subsidies, provided loans were given in time and investments were sounds. Economics&#13;
of some of these investments revealed that they would be viable even without subsidy. Since the&#13;
overall objective of the project is to make them regular clients of the bank over a period of time,&#13;
it is necessary to wean them away from subsidy as early as possible.&#13;
Savings and Contributions to Groups&#13;
26.         Some women are able to save more but are reluctant to save through the group&#13;
fund as there is no way of getting their savings back except as small loans - hence they deposit&#13;
their surplus savings outside of the group. If saved through the group, the members could have&#13;
earned higher returns, at the same time increasing the loanable funds of the group. In mature&#13;
groups, the system of individual deposits should be introduced, on a pilot basis and should be&#13;
thoroughly evaluated.&#13;
27.         Provision was made under the project for contributions to the groups from the&#13;
Capital Development Fund established under the project. This contribution should go as a grant&#13;
to well functioning, dynamic groups in order to increase the possibility of flexibility to its&#13;
members and safeguard sustainability by increasing women members' self-confidence.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
28.         The MTER has broadened the list of indicators to be used in monitoring and&#13;
evaluation. It stresses the need to include data concerning the training of loanees in practical and&#13;
technical skills, in group dynamics and participatory skills, as well as data regarding the degree&#13;
of consolidation of groups (the indicators are listed below). It also stresses the need for&#13;
introducing "participatory evaluation" in the Dharmapuri District to begin with where the lead&#13;
NGO has experience in conducting this exercise and later in other districts.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
STATUS OF WOMEN, TARGET GROUP AND PROJECT AREA&#13;
A. STATUS OF WOMEN&#13;
1.          Women in India have come a long way in the last quarter of a century. Improved&#13;
household food security, an expanding health care system, and maternal and child health&#13;
interventions have brought about impressive gains in women's health status. The life expectancy&#13;
for females at birth has risen from about 32 years in 1951 to about 60 years in 1991. The death rate&#13;
of females has declined significantly, and in 1991 was marginally lower for females than for males&#13;
(9.8 vs. 10.1). The infant mortality (IMR) differential between females and males has also been&#13;
bridged, with a male IMR of 81 and a female IMR of 80 per 1,000 live births. The maternal&#13;
mortality rate is about 40 per 10,000 live births. The girl child has become the focus of the&#13;
universal primary education campaign, and in 1993-94, 71.4 percent of the girls of primary school&#13;
age were enrolled in primary school.&#13;
2.           Yet women in India remain one of the most disadvantaged groups in society.&#13;
Viewed against almost all indicators of development, women continue to lag behind men. There&#13;
are only 927 women for every 1,000 men in India. Women's access to literacy and education is&#13;
more limited. Only 39.4 percent of women are literate against 63.8 percent for men. Of the 324&#13;
million illiterates enumerated in the 1991 Census, 61 percent were women and girls. School&#13;
enrolment exhibits similar gender disparities particularly at secondary and higher levels of&#13;
education. The employment record of women shows more women in the unorganised sector and in&#13;
unskilled and lesser paid jobs. Malnutrition is significantly higher amongst girls than boys, whilst&#13;
even as adults, women frequently do not have equal access to food within the farnily. Despite&#13;
women's higher morbidity, far fewer women than men use health services.&#13;
3.          The continued disadvantaged of women in large measure stems from entrenched&#13;
social attitudes. Whilst the Constitution guaranteed formal equality and radical social legislation&#13;
enacted in recent decades has introduced important innovations in the Indian social structure&#13;
affecting women's status and role, the enactment of laws does not change attitudes and the views of&#13;
society towards the position of women have changed little over the years. Devaluation of women&#13;
commences at birth with the preference for male offspring and continues through a childhood of&#13;
conditioning to the submissive, subservient role required of them in the marital home. A woman is&#13;
never viewed as a person in her own right but always as someone's daughter, wife or mother.&#13;
Within the family, a woman is a social dependent, her worth measured in terms of her ability to&#13;
produce male children. Widows represent a particularly vulnerable group of women, largely&#13;
debarred from remarriage and socially ostracised. Although forming a minority of women, in&#13;
absolute numbers widows represent a large group of women subjected to a great deal of suffering.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-76-&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Where young brides have been married to older men, many widows can be quite young with young&#13;
children to support. The plight of many widows is hidden where they remain part of their&#13;
husband's family but are frequently neglected and ill-treated.&#13;
4.          The position of women in the social structure affects the way they are regarded in&#13;
their economic roles. Although women are major contributors to the survival of the family and are&#13;
vital and productive workers in India's national economy, this is largely unrecognised. The poorer&#13;
the family, the greater its dependence on women's economic productivity. Women contribute a&#13;
much larger share of their earnings to basic family maintenance than do men. Studies in Kerala and&#13;
Tamil Nadu found that despite women's lower wage rates and fewer days of paid employment,&#13;
(which meant that women's incomes were between one-third and one-half of their husband's&#13;
income), women's contribution to the household budget was greater. Whilst on average women's&#13;
earnings represented 53 percent of the earnings of their husbands, women's contribution to&#13;
household maintenance averaged 72 percent. Women on average contributed 98 percent of their&#13;
earnings towards family maintenance whilst men contributed only 78 percent. There is clear&#13;
evidence that women's income contributes markedly to family welfare through better health and&#13;
nutrition, particularly of children. In spite of this, women lack access to the resources which could&#13;
increase their productivity and earning potential. Social attitudes, which always view women as&#13;
only supplementary income earners even when they contribute 50-100 percent of the family&#13;
income, restrict them to low paid, unskilled occupations. More than 90 percent of rural women&#13;
workers are unskilled. Around 90 percent of women are engaged in the informal unorganised&#13;
sector and of these around 80 percent are in agriculture. Wage rates in agriculture are on average&#13;
30 to 50 percent less than for men. Female casual laborers in rural India show the highest incidence&#13;
of poverty of any occupational category, male or female. Women have little access to land and&#13;
other productive assets and this lack of collateral largely excludes them from institutional credit and&#13;
forces them to depend on high cost informal sources of credit to secure capital for self-employment&#13;
activities. Women also generally lack the bureaucratic know-how to make the system work for&#13;
them.&#13;
5.          Rural women living below the poverty line are mostly engaged in agriculture and&#13;
animal husbandry. Landless women engage in non-farm activities during the lean agriculture&#13;
periods, but the major part of their earnings come from agricultural labor. Women are responsible&#13;
for 70 to 80 percent of field work, whilst most post harvest and processing tasks are solely their&#13;
responsibility. However, stark gender divisions assign all activities involving direct manual labor&#13;
to women whilst all operations involving draught animals or machinery are generally performed by&#13;
men. Women are also heavily involved in animal husbandry, particularly small livestock, whilst&#13;
women account for 85 percent of the labor engaged in dairy production.&#13;
6.          In addition to their contribution to household income, women shoulder the entire&#13;
burden of household activities and child care responsibilities. Poor women generally work longer&#13;
hours than their menfolk - up to 14-16 hours per day. At the aggregate level 58 percent of women's&#13;
work time is spent in conventional activities such as cooking, cleaning and child care.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-77-&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
7.          There is a strong correlation between a woman's access to independent income and&#13;
her control over the family's resources. The ability to earn and control income is one of the most&#13;
powerful determinants of a woman's status in the family. Strategies for women's empowerment&#13;
therefore need to take note of the need to increase women's income. The Bank's research'&#13;
indicates that expanding women's economic opportunities and increasing the income they control&#13;
results in greater economic efficiency, improved child health and nutrition and reduced poverty.&#13;
8.          A disproportionate burden of poverty is suffered by female-headed households&#13;
(FHHs) which are noted to be much more poverty prone than male-headed households. Female&#13;
heads are usually widowed, separated or divorced, with much less access to and control over land,&#13;
greater dependency on wage labor for employment, a higher incidence of voluntary unemployment,&#13;
and lower levels of education and literacy. Female heads of households form a higher percentage&#13;
of the lower income deciles - often being amongst the poorest of the poor. At the same time, the&#13;
delivery structures of credit, technical advice, etc., do not reach them as institutions are slow to&#13;
recognise women as heads of households. The smaller size of FHHs also implies a lower&#13;
availability of household labor which affects their ability to undertake economic activities.&#13;
9.          The position of women varies across regions and according to the economic status&#13;
of the household and its place in the caste hierarchy. On the whole, the position of women is more&#13;
constrained in the north (covering Haryana, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh amongst the project states)&#13;
than in the south (including Karnataka). Female labor force participation rates are lower, and female&#13;
land ownership is far less common in the north Health indicators, such as female infant mortality,&#13;
and overall sex ratios, are more heavily biased against females in the north. Female literacy is&#13;
lower in the north than in the south, whilst purdah, high dowry payments and violence against&#13;
women are all much more prevalent in the north. Regional differences are further modified by&#13;
caste and economic circumstances. Constraints on women are stronger among caste Hindus than&#13;
amongst Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) - and stronger amongst land-owning&#13;
cultivators than among landless laborers or marginal farm families. Among the poor who cannot&#13;
afford female seclusion, women have always entered the labor force when they could find work.&#13;

B. Target Group&#13;
10.         Definition of the Target Group. The target group for the project would be women&#13;
below the poverty line in rural areas as defined by the Government of India (GOI) normn, viz., INR&#13;
I 1 000 per household of 5.5 persons. Particular emphasis would be given to including both dejure&#13;
and the more numerous defacto female-headed households who constitute the most disadvantaged&#13;
groups of women (for the country as a whole, 30 percent of households are estimated to be female&#13;
headed). The project would also seek to include widows and deserted women who, although re-&#13;
integrated into extended farnilies, frequently live abject lives as a result of their lack of independent&#13;
means. Particular attention would also be given to ensuring that the most marginal women,&#13;
particularly the landless, are included. In order to ensure strong, cohesive and sustainable affinity&#13;
groups, no eligibility criteria would be set beyond the poverty criterion in order to allow women&#13;
genuine freedom of choice in group membership.&#13;
11.         Procedures for Identification of the Target Group. Beneficiary targeting&#13;
would be the responsibility of the NGOs. While the list of below poverty families (BPL) would&#13;
be used as a starting point, the NGOs would have the flexibility to assess the validity of potential&#13;
beneficiaries and, in particular, to include women who are not on the BPL list but are clearly&#13;
adjudged to be below the poverty line. The targeting process would follow a number of&#13;
sequential steps. First, keeping in mind the cluster approach, groups of villages with a high&#13;
percentage of poor households would be selected. Within the villages/hamlets, potential&#13;
beneficiary groups would be identified through regular visits to the village, informal talks when&#13;
people gather, and participatory processes involving the whole community in identifying the&#13;
social spectrum of the village, and the community's perceptions of who is poor. The NGO&#13;
would then interact with the identified potential beneficiaries to promote the idea of the&#13;
formation of an affinity group to seek to solve their problems of poverty and discrimination. Out&#13;
of this exercise would emerge self-selected groupings of poor women motivated to work together&#13;
for their self-enhancement.&#13;
12.         Profile of the Target Group. The target group would largely comprise women&#13;
from marginal and small farm households and landless families. The landless and near landless&#13;
are estimated to represent around 30 percent of rural households. While around 30 percent of&#13;
households in the country as a whole are estimated to be female headed, in some of the more&#13;
socially conservative states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the percentage is likely to be lower&#13;
due to social practices of absorbing widows into the husband's extended family.&#13;
13.         The percentage of marginal farm families in the project districts ranges from 18 to&#13;
76 percent. The majority of women are engaged in agriculture, with the percentage of the female&#13;
workforce involved in agriculture ranging from 75 percent in Karnataka to 90 percent in Bihar.&#13;
The percentage of the female workforce engaged as agricultural laborers ranges from 35 percent&#13;
in Uttar Pradesh to 59 percent in Bihar.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-79-&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
14.         The target group would comprise a high proportion of SC and ST. Overall the&#13;
presence of SC in the project districts ranges from 4 percent (Panchmahals, Gujarat) to 32&#13;
percent (Hardoi, UP). The largest concentrations of ST population in the project area are found&#13;
in Bihar (43% in Ranchi) and in Gujarat (47% in Panchmahals and 46% in Baruch).&#13;
15.         The position of women and the level of deprivation differs from state to state and&#13;
class to class. Within a region, differences exist between rural and urban women with rural poor&#13;
women generally being the most disadvantaged. Although there exists a broad correlation&#13;
between status of women and the general economic backwardness of the state, there are&#13;
exceptions such as in Haryana where the status of women continues to be much lower despite the&#13;
high rate of economic growth that the state has achieved.&#13;
16.         In addition to regional differences, there are also significant differences on caste&#13;
and class lines within the regions. Constraints on women appear to be stronger among caste&#13;
Hindus than among the SC and ST, and stronger among land-owning cultivators than among&#13;
landless laborers or marginal farm families. Thus the fact that SC/ST, the landless and marginal&#13;
farm families will predominate in the target group means that the degree of social oppression&#13;
faced by the target group is likely to be somewhat diminished. In addition, the poor are known&#13;
to be more open and receptive to change, having less at stake than the privileged and hence,&#13;
within the family, the scope for change would seem to be more propitious. However, by virtue&#13;
of society's views with regard to poverty, gaining recognition within the community may prove&#13;
more difficult. Paradoxically, the experience of the Tamil Nadu project has been that women&#13;
have made more advancement in public life than in their private lives.&#13;
C. Project Area&#13;
17.         The project area comprises the six states of Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Kamataka,&#13;
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Within each state the project would be implemented in a&#13;
limited number of districts. The criteria for the selection of districts are as follows:&#13;
(a)   high incidence of poverty as reflected in the percentage of population below the&#13;
poverty line;&#13;
(b)   high incidence of disadvantaged groups as reflected in the percentage of Scheduled&#13;
Caste and Scheduled Tribe population in the district;&#13;
(c)   ad-7erse status of women as reflected in adverse sex ratio and female illiteracy;&#13;
(d)   representation of regional socio-economic variations within the state to ensure&#13;
testing of project interventions under all circumstances during the initial phase of&#13;
project implementation; and&#13;
(e)   implementation capacity as reflected in the availability of suitable NGOs, lending&#13;
institutions and other public and private sector agencies providing support services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 3&#13;
18.         Project activities would start in one or two districts in each state. A limited number&#13;
of additional districts would be brought under the project in a phased manner in accordance with&#13;
the increasing experience and implementation capacity. Uttar Pradesh is an exception as the project&#13;
would be building on the experience gained in the formation of women's SHGs by the UP Land&#13;
Development Corporation under the World Bank-assisted Sodic Lands Reclamation Project which&#13;
operates in 13 districts. In addition, two new districts (Sitapur and Bandha) would be taken up&#13;
within UP where the work could be coordinated by the UP Women's Welfare Corporation.&#13;
Feedback from the M&amp;E system would indicate the readiness of states to expand the program into&#13;
new districts. The situation would be reviewed and any necessary changes made at the Mid-Term&#13;
Review. The 35 districts identified for project implementation are listed below.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
SELF-HELP GROUP CONCEPT&#13;
A. Role of Groups&#13;
1.    Group formation is seen as crucial to the empowerment process as women draw strength&#13;
from numbers. The group provides: (a) confidence and mutual support for women striving for social&#13;
change; (b) a forum in which women can critically analyze their situations and devise collective&#13;
strategies to overcome their difficulties; (c) a framework for awareness raising, confidence building,&#13;
dissemination of inforrnation and delivery of services, and for developing communal self-reliance and&#13;
collective action; and (d) a vehicle for the promotion of economic activities.&#13;
B. SHG Concept&#13;
2.    The project has adopted the self-help group (SHG) as the appropriate people's institution&#13;
which provides poor women with the space and support necessary to take effective steps towards&#13;
greater control of their lives in private and in society. The essence of an SHG is that it lays the&#13;
foundation for self-reliance through building up an institution which has the capacity to continue the&#13;
development and empowerment processes for women in the future. Self-help promotion attempts to&#13;
raise the choice level of the poor by building up an institutional framework that is in tune with their&#13;
capacities of self administration and better geared towards serving their needs. Until now this&#13;
potential of the rural poor of helping themselves has been underestimated and therefore&#13;
underexplored. Efforts were not made to stimulate the capacity of the rural poor to help themselves.&#13;
3.    Savings and credit is put forward as an important entry point for the activities of SHGs as&#13;
requires the active participation and commitment of all members. It provides them with an&#13;
opportunity to exercise control and participate in decision making. It also satisfies a short term&#13;
needs for crisis credit (for consumption and emergency purposes), leading later to the provision of&#13;
credit for productive purposes, and removes them from exploitation at the hands of the money-&#13;
lenders. The self-help group is seen as a dynamic institution, which builds on the resources and&#13;
management skills of its members and their increasing confidence to become involved in issues and&#13;
programs.&#13;
C. Essential Features of SHGs&#13;
4.    As the concept of SHGs and the strategy to form such groups is not widely known or&#13;
practised in most of the project areas, detailed information is provided on the essential features of&#13;
SHGs, their characteristics, benefits and contribution to the overall empowerment and development&#13;
objectives of the project. In addition, a detailed description is provided on the SHG formation and&#13;
development process. This is followed by a discussion on the role of the NGOs as intervenors and&#13;
ways in which other agencies can be used to supplement the available NGOs in the process of&#13;
forming SHGs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-88-                                  Annex 4&#13;
5.    Some of the essential features of SHGs are:&#13;
(a)    Ownership of the group by the members. The group exists because the members see&#13;
some value in it in helping them to solve their problems through their collective&#13;
efforts. Ownership and control of the group belongs to the members and not to the&#13;
promoting institution, be it an NGO or government.&#13;
(b)   Affinity as the base for coming together. A sustainable, cohesive group needs a&#13;
common underlying bond on which trust can be built. This may be caste, sub-caste,&#13;
blood, community, place of origin, occupation, etc. The intervenors (whether from&#13;
the NGO, bank or government) must have the experience to be able to identify these&#13;
natural groupings or affinity groups. It is, therefore, essential that the groups are&#13;
formned naturally and by the will of the women themselves.&#13;
(c)    Mutual help as the foundation of the group's existence. The rationale for the&#13;
existence of the group is mutual help and progress towards self-reliance and not the&#13;
passive receipt of benefits.&#13;
(d)    Forumfor collective learning. The groups provide a forum for collective learning&#13;
which rural people find more "friendly", based on mutual respect/support, and which&#13;
is consequently more effective than the individual approach that is commonly&#13;
adopted.&#13;
(e)    Forum for inter-agency dialogue and cooperation. The groups provide a firn base&#13;
for dialogue and cooperation in programs with other institutions like government&#13;
departments, cooperatives, financial and panchayat institutions; if the groups are&#13;
functioning well, they have the credibility and the power to ensure their participation&#13;
in identifying, planning, budgeting and implementation of programs for the&#13;
empowerment of women with a special focus on the poor.&#13;
(f)    Cost-effective credit delivery mechanism. The group provides a cost effective credit&#13;
delivery system as the transactions costs of lending decrease sharply both to the&#13;
banks and the borrowers. At the same time, individual members maintain control&#13;
over the pace, timing, size and schedules of loans and programs. The group also&#13;
helps to build the individual member's management capacity to optimize returns.&#13;
D. Indicative SHG Development Process&#13;
Operations of SHGs&#13;
6.    Group size should be kept small, less than 20 members in order to ensure the necessary trust&#13;
and confidence essential for building a cohesive group. Groups of this size are also a prerequisite to&#13;
be treated as informal entities for the purposes of linkage with the banks'.&#13;
Prima facie, SHGs with more than 20 members would attract the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956&#13;
which requires all associations of more than 20 persons formed for the purposes of acquisition of gain by&#13;
the association or its individual members to be registered as a company under this Act.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-89-                                Annex 4&#13;
7.    It is essential that the groups are democratically managed and all decisions concerning the&#13;
group are made on the basis of group consensus. All SHG members would participate in the decision&#13;
making processes and no executive committee would be formed as suspicion may crop up when the&#13;
ownership and management of the SHG diverge which could prove fatal to the existence of the SHG.&#13;
8.    Each group would, with the assistance of the NGO, frame its own regulations for the&#13;
operation of the group savings or common fund, on the basis of group consensus, covering minimum&#13;
amount of monthly or weekly savings; maximum loan amount for the first and subsequent loans;&#13;
interest rates; repayment periods; penalties and action to be taken in the event of default; eligibility&#13;
criteria for loans; allocation of loans between consumption and production, etc.&#13;
9.    Regular meetings are important for cementing groups. Ideally groups should meet weekly&#13;
but the minimum would be monthly. At least one formal business meeting, at which all members&#13;
would be expected to attend, should be conducted each month. All the operations of the savings and&#13;
loans fund would be conducted at this meeting. Members would be required to bring their savings&#13;
and loan repayments to these meetings, applications for loans would be discussed by all the group&#13;
members and loans would be sanctioned and disbursed during the meeting (depending on the&#13;
availability of funds). The NGO field worker would initially attend these meetings to provide advice&#13;
if required and to check that the accounts are maintained correctly. If the group meets weekly or&#13;
fortnightly, savings and loans business can be transacted more frequently. However, the other&#13;
meetings should be used primarily for discussions linked to awareness raising; follow-up informal&#13;
interactive training sessions on group dynamics, leadership, etc., by the NGO field worker or&#13;
training on special topics, e.g., health, nutrition, agriculture, etc., at which outside resource persons&#13;
would be invited to attend. In addition, one meeting a month should be devoted to compiling the&#13;
letter for exchanging with other groups.&#13;
10.   Since most of the transactions would take place on this one day each month, liquidity&#13;
management should not prove to be much of a problem for the group as it is expected that the&#13;
majority of the savings would be loaned directly so that the problem of sizable surpluses would not&#13;
arise. A portion of any surplus funds would be kept in the cash box to be immediately available to&#13;
meet emergency needs of members. Most groups agree that the two representatives may decide on&#13;
emergency loans to group members up to a set amount to be formally sanctioned at the next group&#13;
meeting. The cash box would have two locks with one key held by each of the group&#13;
representatives. Additional surpluses would be deposited in the bank. Similarly for loans sanctioned&#13;
in excess of the cash collected at the meeting, additional cash would be drawn from the bank and&#13;
disbursed to the borrowers at the next meeting.&#13;
11.   The representatives would prepare a report and financial statement to the group every six&#13;
months. These half-yearly meetings would also be used for amending regulations and policies. As&#13;
the capital accumulations of the group increase over the years, the opportunity for the greater use of&#13;
loans for productive purposes would grow and groups would be guided towards granting larger loans&#13;
with longer repayment periods. Groups would generally recognize the need to charge lower interest&#13;
rates on longer term loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-90-                                Annex 4&#13;
12.   Loans would initially be provided mainly for consumption purposes but as the savings fund&#13;
grows and the group gains experience in managing the fund, more loans would be given for small&#13;
productive purposes. This would enable the group to gain experience of managing credit, learn&#13;
credit discipline and build up a track record of sound credit management making it an attractive&#13;
client for the bank.&#13;
13.   Experience shows that women's needs and ability to manage credit through their groups&#13;
rapidly outgrows the limitations of their own resources. Hence, after a minimum of six months and&#13;
more usually nine months, and based on the performance of the group in managing the funds, the&#13;
banks would be encouraged to provide a bulk loan to the group to be disbursed by the group to its&#13;
members as individual loans for both consumption and productive purposes - the group would be&#13;
responsible for repayment to the bank. Initially this linkage with the bank would take the form of a&#13;
line of credit (cash credit limit), initially equivalent to the group's savings (see Annex 7, para 12 for&#13;
further details). The cash credit limit is gradually raised in line with the bank's increasing&#13;
confidence in the group's credit management record. Over time, the group may, in consultation with&#13;
the bank, decide to progress to a group term loan or it may prefer to continue with the cash credit&#13;
arrangements. This process would constitute the beginning of a sustainable relationship with the&#13;
bank providing for a continual flow of credit to the group beyond the project period.&#13;
14.   At the same time, the SHGs would provide the platform for other aspects of empowerment&#13;
such as literacy, dissemination of information on family welfare, health and nutrition, financial&#13;
management, legal rights, etc., and the base for social action. Participatory processes involving the&#13;
husbands' participation would be encouraged on occasions to discuss relationships within the family,&#13;
participation in decision making and control of income and sharing of non-economic family&#13;
responsibilities in order to begin to break down stereotyped roles and to foster "togetherness" in&#13;
male/female relationships and a working towards the goal of a more equal partnership in the family.&#13;
15.   Once groups have became mature (after 3-4 years) the concept of individual savings&#13;
accounts with the group from which women would be able to withdraw their savings could be&#13;
introduced, initially on a pilot basis. This would permit women with a greater capacity to save to&#13;
have access to their savings while increasing the loanable funds of the group (see Annex 7, para 11).&#13;
Group Development Process&#13;
16.   Based on the present accumulated experience, the process of SHG formation and&#13;
development can be separated into three phases as indicated below. This also emphasizes the part to&#13;
be played by the NGO field worker at each stage and the features of the SHG at the end of each&#13;
phase. Groups would develop at their own pace and hence the timings given are purely indicative&#13;
and will vary from group to group.&#13;
Phase I - Identification and Formation of SHGs: 0 - 4 months&#13;
17.   This is a critical function on which depends all the further progress of the group. The NGO&#13;
as intervenor plays a key role here in identifying affinity groups to form the basis of the SHG. This&#13;
is where the experience of the NGO is crucial.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-91-                                  Annex 4&#13;
18.   The means used by the intervenors to identify these affinity groups are several; a few popular&#13;
ones are:&#13;
regular visits to the village, meeting with informal groups gathered around tea shops,&#13;
temples, water spots, markets, provision shops, milk collection centers; special care&#13;
should be given to visit and interact in areas where the scheduled castes and tribes&#13;
live and where women tend to gather;&#13;
involvement in a common action like desilting a pond, or building a road also helps&#13;
to identify these groups, provided people organize the action themselves; it is noticed&#13;
that in such cases they tend to work in affinity groups;&#13;
participatory appraisal methods are useful since they too involve all the community&#13;
in various exercises which help to identify the various groupings in the village, the&#13;
assets and resources of each family, people's perception of who is poor, their credit&#13;
needs, incomes and seasonal variations; the community is involved in collecting and&#13;
correcting data in a manner in which all can participate using instruments to which&#13;
they are accustomed such as sticks, stones, seeds, colored powders, etc.&#13;
during the participatory process background information which will be useful in&#13;
subsequent stages of the group's activities, e.g., when it begins to focus on economic&#13;
activities, is also collected viz., the availability of natural resources, activities&#13;
undertaken, skills, markets, perceptions on poverty and de, elopment constraints, etc.&#13;
These topics would be addressed later in a more expanded fashion at the appropriate&#13;
time.&#13;
19.   During this phase, since the SHGs are entirely composed of women, it has been found&#13;
necessary to meet with men and to explain what is going on and especially the benefits that will&#13;
accrue to the family through SHGs. Group formation is not complete with the first meeting. It takes&#13;
several meetings over a period of 2 to 4 months for the group to establish a definite membership.&#13;
During this period members may leave and others may join if the group agrees.&#13;
20.   The meetings held during this period are not only social gatherings; the members also raise&#13;
issues concerning the family and the village. Matters regarding savings and lending are also debated&#13;
thoroughly as this is the major common function of the group. Agreement to save and to lend&#13;
indicates a degree of trust in one another, the willingness to abide by group decisions without&#13;
breaking bonds and confidence in the group; these are the building blocks of effective SHGs.&#13;
21.   In this initial phase it is necessary that intervenors have experience in identifying and&#13;
forming SHGs and care should be taken to ensure that the NGOs place experienced staff, at least at&#13;
middle management level, to play a key role during this phase.&#13;
22.   Critical Features of the SHG at the End of Phase I. These include:&#13;
-     the membership of the group is identifiable and stable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-92-                                 Annex 4&#13;
the group has given itself a name.&#13;
two members of the group have been elected/selected as the group's&#13;
representatives.&#13;
the date, time and place of meetings has been decided on by the members and&#13;
meetings are held regularly according to the schedule&#13;
the members have agreed to save regularly, to create a habit of thrift and to establish&#13;
a culture of self help. Some groups may have started savings. If savings have begun,&#13;
the group has opened an account in the nearest bank or Post Office. The account has&#13;
two signatories, either one from the SHG and the other from the NGO intervenor or&#13;
both from the SHG.&#13;
basic records like (i) attendance register; (ii) minutes book; and (iii) members&#13;
savings ledgers and individual savings pass books (if savings have started) are being&#13;
maintained.&#13;
Phase II - Group Stabilization: 4 months to 15 months&#13;
23.   The key activities which take place during this important phase in the development of the&#13;
SHG are:&#13;
Savings are regular and lending operations gather strength. This provides the&#13;
members of the SHG with an opportunity to acquire the skills to manage its&#13;
resources. The group decides on the rate of savings, on the timing of the loans, on&#13;
the schedule of payments and repayments; it assess whether the member is able to&#13;
manage the asset for which she has asked for a loan and decides on priorities.&#13;
Meetings are held regularly; preferably every week; attendance is maintained and&#13;
averages over 80 percent; repayments average over 90 percent; sanctions for default&#13;
on repayment and for deviant behavior (smoking, arriving late for meetings, etc.) are&#13;
imposed and accepted.&#13;
The minutes and accounts books are maintained either by a member or by the NGO&#13;
staff or preferably by someone from the village who is paid by the SHG for such&#13;
services.&#13;
Gender issues concerning women in private and public life are raised and discussed.&#13;
Literacy and numeracy classes are conducted and attended by all members.&#13;
24.   Group training is held regularly, with at least three modules each of two days during this&#13;
phase to enable all to participate effectively, especially the weaker members (in some cases special&#13;
modules may have to be conducted for them), to build group culture and to raise the level of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-93-                                Annex 4&#13;
commitment to mutual support and acceptance of group decisions and of self-confidence in private&#13;
and public life. Details of the indicative coverage of the training programs are given in Annex 12.&#13;
25.   Training of SHG Representatives. The two representatives who have been elected need to&#13;
be trained to conduct meetings, to help the group to establish a supportive culture, to establish a&#13;
priorities in lending and to impose and accept sanctions. They need to equip themselves with the&#13;
skills of numeracy and literacy to enable them to keep a check on what is recorded in the minutes&#13;
and pass books. They need to develop leadership qualities and the confidence to relate with&#13;
institutions like government departments and banks as well as to provide leadership in organizing&#13;
common action programs. It is important that the group selects/elects the representatives for the&#13;
following year at least six months in advance to enable them to build up these skills and confidence.&#13;
If the group representatives are not changed every year, there is a danger that power will accumulate&#13;
in the hands of a few which will in turn prevent the effective participation of all members. Rotation&#13;
of representatives provides all the members with an opportunity to acquire the skills of group&#13;
leadership. Since the first set of representatives are likely to be the most proficient women in the&#13;
group, once they have handed over responsibilities they could play the role of group animators, after&#13;
the groups have been in operation for 12-15 months, taking on some of the supportive roles played&#13;
hitherto by the NGO worker, provided they have had at least 3-4 modules of training and exposure to&#13;
operating SHGs. One or two small common action programs in the village are planned and&#13;
implemented preferably in collaboration with other SHGs if they exist in the village.&#13;
26.   Gender Issues. Gender issues concerning women and the girl child are raised at meetings&#13;
and form an important part of training. Men are invited to participate in group exchange and in&#13;
common action programs and occasionally in SHG meetings. Negative reactions from men to&#13;
women's absence from home when they attend meetings or are involved in common action or even&#13;
to the increasing presence and profile of women in public life is a common feature during this&#13;
period. NGOs have to cope with this problem even offering counseling service in the home when&#13;
the problem threatens to escalate.&#13;
27.   Support to the group fund of the SHG. After six to nine months, if the SHG is progressing&#13;
according to the indicators mentioned above, the group would be linked to a lending institution to&#13;
provide a line of credit matching the savings of the group (see para 25 above). This helps to build up&#13;
available capital, enabling members to access larger loans for business, trading and other small&#13;
income generating activities.&#13;
28.   Role of NGO and other intervenors. The NGO continues to play a key role in this phase&#13;
in the training of the groups and group representatives as well as in gender sensitization. As far as&#13;
the SHGs are concerned, the NGO moves away from direct intervention to support the process of&#13;
group growth by attending all the meetings of the SHGs and intervening where required. The line&#13;
departments and other private sector institutions play a direct role in training asset owners and&#13;
village resource persons.&#13;
29.   Features of the SHGs at the End of Phase II. These would include:&#13;
-     all the members are engaged in savings;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-94-                                 Annex 4&#13;
loaning is taking place for both consumption and, to a lesser extent, productive&#13;
purposes;&#13;
all transactions are supported with documentation; a summary of loans and&#13;
recoveries is posted in a public place and regularly updated;&#13;
the group fund is steadily increasing through interest, savings and fund raising by the&#13;
group;&#13;
the group's resources have been augmented through obtaining a line of credit to the&#13;
group from the bank or other lending institution;&#13;
the group fund is revolving; bank balance is low or nil;.&#13;
the recovery rate is consistently over 90 percent;&#13;
attendance is consistently over 80 percent;&#13;
the members have acquired the skills of literacy and numeracy to conduct meetings&#13;
and to resolve conflicts;&#13;
their confidence to act in public life has increased; they are able to relate with other&#13;
institutions and government as a group;&#13;
the group has the experience of organizing and being involved in one or two common&#13;
action programs; and&#13;
the members have begun to address gender issues and to take small though&#13;
significant actions both in public and at home.&#13;
Phase III Growth of self-reliance: 15 months to 36 months - Withdrawal of the NGO&#13;
30.   The key developments which take place for the SHG during this phase are:&#13;
-     SHG takes over responsibility for managing its own affairs including payment for&#13;
services required;&#13;
-     Promotion of inter-action between the SHGs within the cluster to facilitate cross-&#13;
learning and sharing between groups and to develop a more effective power base for&#13;
the women;&#13;
-     Greater emphasis on economic activities and on improving productivity through&#13;
technology transfer;&#13;
-     Credit available from bank increases in line with group's credit history and with&#13;
bank's increased confidence in group's credit management capacity;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-95-                                 Annex 4&#13;
Linkage with other technical agencies for technology transfer, demonstrations,&#13;
exposure to menus of options for more productive and remunerative income&#13;
generating activities;&#13;
31.   Role of intervenors. The intervenors, particularly the NGOs, need to integrate withdrawal&#13;
into their strategy from the beginning in order that interventions support the growth of self reliant&#13;
people's institutions and not increase their dependency. Withdrawal becomes more tangible and&#13;
acceptable after the major interventions required to build up the groups taper off.&#13;
32.   The process of withdrawal would be gradual and the duration of this phase variable&#13;
depending on the capacity of the SHGs. It is expected that the process of withdrawal could be&#13;
substantially completed by the end of the third year after the formation of the group, but in costing&#13;
the services of the NGOs allowance has been made for some support in the fourth year as a&#13;
precaution.&#13;
33.   During the later years of the project, efforts would be made to foster the emergence of inter-&#13;
group associations at the cluster level and inter-cluster associations, but the need for such bodies and&#13;
their functions should be decided by the group (see Annex 6 for further details). Experience of apex&#13;
bodies in Tamil Nadu has shown that they are vulnerable to political influences or are used as steps&#13;
towards political positions. Politicization of apex bodies weakens and eventually destroys the self&#13;
help groups. Care should be taken that the groups are strong enough to control the functioning of the&#13;
apex bodies before they are formed. In some parts of Tamil Nadu, groups have restricted the roles of&#13;
apex bodies to supervising the groups and assisting in problem solving; they have refused to give&#13;
apex bodies any funds or the power to control resources.&#13;
34.   During this period the supportive role of the NGO decreases. It needs, however, to ensure&#13;
that regular feedback and analysis of data is available in order to identify trends in financial&#13;
management of the SHGs. A few guidelines given in Attachment 1 relating to the management of&#13;
savings, the group fund, loans, book-keeping and audit will help the NGO to identify important&#13;
indicators of the SHGs' performance.&#13;
E. Strategies for Promotion of SHGs in Areas Without NGO Presence&#13;
35.   Since NGOs are recognised to be the most effective agents for the mobilization and provision&#13;
of on-going support to women's SHGs, project activities would start in districts/blocks with strong&#13;
NGOs who would be contracted by the WDCs to form and sustain the SHGs. However, suitable&#13;
NGOs, oriented to the concepts of self-reliance and self-help which underpin the SHGs, are not&#13;
omnipresent. Hence, it will be necessary to develop alternative mechanisms for forming SHGs in areas&#13;
without NGOs. In such areas, efforts would be made to harness the enthusiasm and commitment of&#13;
socially motivated people within the community. These are likely to be people who have been&#13;
campaign workers under other awareness raising programs such as the Total Literacy Campaign&#13;
(TLC). The WDC and the lead (experienced) NGOs would jointly identify suitable socially motivated&#13;
field workers 6-12 months in advance of commencement of work in an area devoid of NGOs. After a&#13;
period of initial training, they would work with the lead NGOs to gain practical field experience for&#13;
around six months before returning to their "home" areas to start forming SHGs. During the first year&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-96-                                Annex 4&#13;
of their independent operation, the lead NGO would continue to supervise and support their work. In&#13;
time it is expected that these workers would be able to work independently like other smaller NGOs.&#13;
Funding required to implement this approach would be channelled through the lead NGOs until the&#13;
"emerging" NGO starts operating independently.&#13;
36.   Haryana WDC intends to experiment with a variant of this approach through fostering the&#13;
formation of a registered society to be managed by a selected number of field workers within the&#13;
community, particularly those previously actively involved in promoting the TLC. This society, after&#13;
training in the key elements of the project concept/approach , would take on the responsibility for the&#13;
formation of SHGs under the overall guidance of the District Project Coordinating Committee and the&#13;
WDC. It would engage field workers as required. The experience of other strategies involving various&#13;
community groups in the promotion of SHGs currently being piloted would also be closely watched&#13;
and evaluated. These would include WEMTOP's experiment with the promotion of SHGs by producer&#13;
cooperatives linked to the Khadi and Village Industries Commission.&#13;
F. Inclusion of Existing SHGs&#13;
37.   The growth path of SHGs outlined above indicates that it takes at least two years before SHG&#13;
members are likely to become actively involved in investing in income generating activities on a&#13;
significant scale. At the same time, the accumulation of savings by many SHGs under on-going SHG&#13;
programs indicates that groups are not readily able to identify potential viable investment opportunities.&#13;
Hence, this is an area to which the project needs to devote considerable attention. In order to provide&#13;
an early opportunity to promote income generating activities, as well as the development of inter-group&#13;
clusters/associations, the project would benefit from the inclusion of some existing SHGs formed by&#13;
NGOs. These groups would need to be consistent with the project concept. To this end, the following&#13;
criteria would be used to screen existing SHGs for inclusion in the project:&#13;
-     the group constitutes a democratically managed affinity group which conforms to the&#13;
general principles of SHGs outlined above;&#13;
-     the group is involved in the management of savings and credit;&#13;
-     the group is orientated towards self-reliance;&#13;
-     the group exhibits a high degree of group cohesion and stability and constitutes a good&#13;
group as measured by such indicators as high degree of attendance at meetings,&#13;
participation of all members in group discussions and decision making and regularity of&#13;
savings;&#13;
demonstration of sound credit management including high degree of internal loaning&#13;
and rotation of savings, and high repayment rate (above 90 percent);&#13;
linkage with bank providing resources for investment in income generating activities;&#13;
readiness to undertake income generating activities; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-97-                                 Annex 4&#13;
group is sponsored by a project partner NGO which has been trained in the promotion&#13;
of business development.&#13;
38.   Other criteria to be taken into consideration relate to the sponsoring NGO and would include:&#13;
-     Existing SHGs are attached to NGOs which have been contracted to form new SHGs&#13;
and are located in or adjacent to areas of the district selected for implementation of the&#13;
project;&#13;
-     The NGOs which have promoted the SHGs should perceive SHGs as an important&#13;
means of women's empowerment and should be giving priority attention to SHG work&#13;
(in terms of staff time, training, and resources);&#13;
-     in order to facilitate formation of clusters of SHGs, the existing SHGs should be&#13;
located in close geographical proximity; and&#13;
-     the NGO should agree to work on the components which it may not have pursued to&#13;
date, particularly business support inputs, and promotion of clusters/associations.&#13;
39.   Existing SHGs would be evaluated for inclusion in the project by the NGOs and verified by the&#13;
WDC District Project Manager. "Adopted" existing SHGs would, however, not exceed 30 percent of&#13;
the anticipated number of SHGs to be managed in any state program.&#13;
40.   Groups formed under other programs such as Mahila Samakhya, DWCRA and TLC are&#13;
unlikely to meet these criteria. These groups tend to be large, lack homogeneity and affinity and are&#13;
not constituted as self-help groups. Thus, it may not be appropriate to incorporate them wholesale into&#13;
the project. The project may benefit from the awareness raising and mobilization efforts of these&#13;
programs but it is likely that potential SHGs would only emerge as sub-sets from within these groups.&#13;
G. Promotion of SHGs by Mature SHGs&#13;
41.        In order to promote the wider replication of SHGs in a more cost effective and&#13;
sustainable manner, the project would enable mature SHGs to promote the formation of additional&#13;
SHGs. Experience of other NGO programs indicates that stabilized mature SHGs have a powerful&#13;
demonstration effect within the locality and frequently women in neighbouring villages express a&#13;
desire to form an SHG. These women should first be encouraged to visit the mature group and learn of&#13;
their experiences. It is at this point that the members of the new group assess their own capability,&#13;
perceive problem areas and satisfy their queries. The potential new SHG would then request assistance&#13;
from a representative of the mature SHG in establishing the new SHG. Whilst the representatives from&#13;
the mature SHG can provide general guidance and support, training inputs for the new SHG from the&#13;
NGO are likely to be required, at least initially. Over time, however, the project would train members&#13;
from mature SHGs who show leadership qualities and communication skills as trainers. The project&#13;
would seek to form one training team of members from mature SHGs from each cluster of villages.&#13;
These training teams would be instrumental in spreading the SHG concept and forming SHGs on a&#13;
wider scale in their locality. The NGO's role would be to strengthen the capacity of the cluster and the&#13;
existing groups to facilitate this process through various leadership and capacity building programs.&#13;

There are seasonal variations in the amounts saved   Several groups make a distinction between&#13;

if there are overdue instalments.&#13;
When the Banks advance loans they should be&#13;

RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
NGO PARTICIPATION&#13;
A. Role of NGOs&#13;
Formation and Support to SHGs&#13;
1.          NGOs would play the key role in mobilizing the poor women in the communities&#13;
and forming them into SHGs and providing on-going support to the SHGs. It is essential that the&#13;
NGO staff adopt an approach in interacting with the SHGs which promotes self-reliance and not&#13;
dependency. Thus, the primary role of the NGO would be to motivate and organize groups and&#13;
to provide the SHG members with opportunities to acquire the skills to manage the group's&#13;
affairs. NGOs would follow participatory processes in order to promote self-reliance.&#13;
2.          WDCs would engage NGOs on contract to form and support SHGs. The full&#13;
scope of the support to be provided by the NGO staff would cover:&#13;
(a)   Identifying affinity groups.&#13;
(b)   Forming SHGs.&#13;
(c)   Guiding groups in the formulation of savings and credit procedures and liaising&#13;
with local lending institutions.&#13;
(d)   Attending all group meetings for the first 9-12 months after which, according to&#13;
the strength of the group, attendance can be reduced but should be at least once&#13;
per month for the first two years.&#13;
(e)   Providing initial training of group members and group representatives by the&#13;
NGO training team and the provision of follow-up training to group members at&#13;
regular group meetings.&#13;
(f)   Maintaining the group accounts and minutes for first 12 months (if no suitable&#13;
person from within the group or community can be found initially), and training&#13;
of a group member or local person to maintain the accounts thereafter.&#13;
(g)   Auditing group accounts half-yearly in the first year and thereafter annually.&#13;
(h)   Assisting women in the selection of appropriate income generating activities&#13;
through participatory processes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102-&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
(i)    Channeling the requirements of group members for training in skill development&#13;
and entrepreneurship; for other technical support services e.g. design and&#13;
technology and assistance in establishing market linkages to the WDC district&#13;
staff.&#13;
(i)    Assisting SHGs in community consultation to establish priorities for social&#13;
programs and submission of proposals to WDC district office.&#13;
(k)   Assisting groups with the organization of cluster level meetings as per the interest&#13;
of the groups and later with formation of associations of clusters;&#13;
(1)   upporting common action programs and lobbying activities of SHGs.&#13;
(m)   Collecting statistics on each group and preparing monthly monitoring tables as&#13;
equired as inputs to the M&amp;E system; and quarterly progress reports.&#13;
(n)   Performing the necessary administrative functions including: (i) preparation of&#13;
uarterly progress reports on activities for submission to WDC District Project&#13;
anager; (ii) maintaining accounts of project expenditure in format agreed with&#13;
DC and submitting quarterly statements of expenditure, with documentation, to&#13;
DC district office; and (iii) attending meetings at district and state level as&#13;
equested by WDC.&#13;
3           Sharing of responsibilities with WDC staff . The NGO staff and WDC district&#13;
staff would work as a team. Through its close contacts with the group members, the NGO would&#13;
be responsible for nurturing the development of the groups and the members and for channeling&#13;
the requirements for support in other areas (particularly in relation to income generating&#13;
activities), which the NGO is generally not equipped to provide, to the WDC. The WDC district&#13;
staff would be responsible for organizing the delivery of the required support services to the&#13;
SHGs. In addition, the WDC staff would be responsible for monitoring the overall&#13;
implementation of the project activities.&#13;
4.          Each SHG would receive support from the NGO for a period of 3-4 years. The&#13;
nature of the specific activities to be supported by the NGO would change with the different&#13;
stages of the group maturation as follows:&#13;
(a)   Start-up Phase&#13;
The NGO would be actively involved in the group formation and development&#13;
process and assisting the SHG in the establishment of its operating procedures,&#13;
especially for its savings and credit operations. It is expected that after 12 months&#13;
the SHG would have taken over responsibility for the maintenance of its records&#13;
and accounts through training a competent group member (if available) or paying&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-103-&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
for the services of a person in the community to perform these tasks. They would&#13;
also be involved in providing training for group members and group&#13;
representatives (see para 5(d)), including exposure visits and inter-group&#13;
exchanges. It is expected that within 3-6 months after commencing its operations,&#13;
the group would begin revolving its savings through internal loaning to meet the&#13;
consumption needs of its members.&#13;
(b)   Group Stabilization&#13;
The NGO would assist the SHGs to establish linkages with the banks or other&#13;
lending institutions to obtain a line of credit to augment the resources of the&#13;
groups. As the focus of the SHG members moves more towards the adoption of&#13;
various economic activities, the role of the NGO would switch to assisting the&#13;
SHG members in the selection of appropriate activities and ensuring access to the&#13;
necessary technical support services which they require. Thus, the NGO would&#13;
engage the members in the interactive processes of presentation and discussion of&#13;
the menu of options for for on-farm and non-farm activities, involving the&#13;
respective technical service providers engaged by the project management to&#13;
provide clear information on the technical parameters.&#13;
The NGO would then be involved in channeling the women's requirements for&#13;
training and technical and marketing support to the WDC. It would assist the SHG&#13;
in identifying women from within the group or community to be trained as the&#13;
resource persons for the village to provide the basic technical support for land&#13;
based and animal husbandry activities.&#13;
The NGO would also be involved in assisting the SHGs in drawing up their&#13;
requests for social programs in consultation with the community and in preparing&#13;
proposals for the development of the community asset selected for submission to&#13;
WDC.&#13;
Where SHGs express an interest in establishing inter-group linkages through&#13;
coming together at the cluster level to form a loose association, the NGO would&#13;
assist the process through identification and training of leaders/office bearers,&#13;
providing guidance on operational structure and procedures and assisting the&#13;
member SHGs to evaluate the pros and cons of the potential roles which the&#13;
cluster body could play (see Annex 6).&#13;
(c)   Growth of Self-Reliance and Withdrawal of the NGO&#13;
During this phase the NGO would continue to support the SHG members in&#13;
establishing their economic activities but increasingly responsibilities would be&#13;
taken over by the SHGs themselves. To facilitate this, the focus of the NGOs'&#13;
attention would begin to switch from close interaction with individual groups to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104-&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
assisting the capacity building of clusters of SHGs and, at a later stage,&#13;
associations of SHG clusters.&#13;
(d)   Training of SHG members and group representatives&#13;
Training of the SHG members and group representatives would be treated as a&#13;
separate function of the NGOs. The initial training programs to be provided to&#13;
each group would cover group development, participatory processes, group&#13;
management, maintenance of records and accounts, gender sensitization, and&#13;
social issues. It is estimated that one trainer would be able to provide the initial&#13;
training to 20 SHGs per year. This initial training in the fundamental principles of&#13;
SHGs is crucial to the development and future sustainability of the groups. Hence,&#13;
it is essential that a consistent philosophy is presented by all intervenors at this&#13;
formative stage. To achieve this, the overall content of training programs would&#13;
be agreed on between the WDC and all partner NGOs and, where necessary,&#13;
appropriate orientation and training would be provided by a Resource NGO for&#13;
the staff of the participating NGOs. Given the critical nature of this input,&#13;
implementation of training provided to the SHGs would be closely monitored by&#13;
the WDC.&#13;
B. NGO Staff&#13;
5.    NGO staff inputs. The changing nature of the role of the NGO will also require inputs&#13;
from different types of staff. In the first stage the input would mainly be from the field worker&#13;
with support from specialist trainers within the NGO. In stages 2 and 3, the frequency of&#13;
involvement from the field worker in general support to the SHGs would reduce but the SHGs&#13;
would require inputs from more professional, technical personnel on the NGO staff. Thus&#13;
although the intensity of inputs to the SHG would reduce, the involvement of higher cost staff&#13;
may mean that there is no significant change in the overall cost of servicing the SHGs. Given the&#13;
broad-ranging support to be provided by the NGO staff it is expected that participating NGOs&#13;
would recruit incremental staff with appropriate expertise and provide necessary additional&#13;
training before taking charge of groups at various stages. Adequate financial support has been&#13;
provided under the project to ensure recruitment of good quality staff and maintenance of&#13;
appropriate skills (see para 1O). It is estimated that in all the participating states (with the&#13;
exception of UP and Haryana which have larger villages and no tribal areas under the project), a&#13;
field worker would be able to service up to 10 groups of mixed levels of development with 1-2&#13;
groups formed per village. In UP and Haryana where the number of groups per village is&#13;
expected to average 3, a field worker would be able to service 15-20 groups. The NGOs would&#13;
also provide the necessary supervisory staff to oversee implementation at the field level. It is&#13;
estimated that one supervisor would be able to supervise 5 field workers but in UP and Haryana,&#13;
due to the greater concentration of groups, the number would increase to 7-8 field workers. In&#13;
addition the services of the NGO accountant would be required to train the persons selected by&#13;
the SHGs to maintain their accounts and to audit the SHG accounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-105-&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
6.          Training of NGO staff. The project would fund the training of NGO staff. This&#13;
would include initial and annual refresher training for the field workers and supervisors; training&#13;
of the specialist trainers imparting the initial training in group dynamics and management to the&#13;
SHGs; training of the NGO accountants and on-going training in entrepreneurship and business&#13;
development, gender sensitization and communications skills and use of communications&#13;
materials for all NGO project staff. This training may be organized internally where the NGO&#13;
has the relevant experience or it would be organized by the WDC Training Coordinator.&#13;
Training of field workers would largely take place within the states with the exception of MP and&#13;
Haryana which do not have NGOs with experience in SHGs as resource agencies. Staff from&#13;
participating NGOs in these states would therefore be trained outside of the state by one of the&#13;
experienced NGOs in the country. This training would be supplemented by exposure visits and&#13;
study tours within country with provision for two overseas study tours per year for NGO staff.&#13;
C. Selection Criteria for NGOs&#13;
7.          The experience of the IFAD supported Tamil Nadu Women's Development&#13;
Project has highlighted the crucial importance of the selection of NGOs with the right orientation&#13;
as project partners. Under the Tamil Nadu project a very clear relationship could be&#13;
distinguished between the strength and sustainability of the groups and the philosophy of the&#13;
promoting NGO. This emphasizes the need to evaluate not only the performance but also the&#13;
outlook and attitudes of the NGOs which wish to participate. Negative factors are welfarist and&#13;
paternalistic approaches to the beneficiaries which create dependency not self-reliance.&#13;
8.          The selection of NGOs would be guided by the following criteria:&#13;
(a)   As part of the legal requirements, the NGO should be a registered body under the&#13;
relevant State Law. It should maintain its accounting records and have properly&#13;
audited annual statements of income and expenditure;&#13;
(b)   The orientation and philosophy of the NGO should conform to the essential&#13;
features of the project design viz. adherence to participatory processes; belief in&#13;
the objective of self-reliance and empowerment of women; experience in the&#13;
formation of affinity groups, preferably groups managing credit and involved in&#13;
income generating activities and experience of capacity building of grassroots&#13;
institutions including the basic systems required - namely, records, accounts,&#13;
formal meetings and feedback systems. If an NGO has the right orientation and a&#13;
good track record but lacks specific experience in SHG formation. it can be&#13;
provided with adequate exposure and training;&#13;
(c)   The NGO is open to learn and absorb new strategies and ideas;&#13;
(d)   The NGO is based in the project area, has field experience in the area and has&#13;
adequate numbers of field level staff with a clear understanding of the socio-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-106-&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
economic, cultural and political situation of the area. They should also have&#13;
excellent communications skills and good rapport with the community;&#13;
(e)    As NGOs participating in the project would be part of a larger effort involving&#13;
other NGOs, government officials, private sector institutions and others, the NGO&#13;
should be able to interact smoothly with and be part of a team;&#13;
(f)    The NGO should have internal stability so as to ensure long-tern support to the&#13;
project;&#13;
(g)    The NGO should be engaged in secular operations (i.e., development activities of&#13;
religious NGOs should not be associated with proselytizing) and should not be&#13;
affiliated with any political organization.&#13;
(h)    The NGO should be willing to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with&#13;
the government committing itself: (i) to pursuing the objectives of the project; (ii)&#13;
to making changes within its strategy and systems if there are obstacles in&#13;
achieving the objectives of the project; (iii) to attend meetings and to contribute to&#13;
the feedback systems and procedures required by Government including regular&#13;
reporting. It is only after the MOU is signed that the agreement to contract the&#13;
NGO for the project outlining clearly its role and function can be entered into.&#13;
D. Contractual Arrangements for NGOs&#13;
9.            The payment to the NGOs would be made on the basis of an annual fee per SHG&#13;
serviced in accordance with certain performance criteria. The basic fee would be related to the&#13;
inputs of field workers and other staff required to fulfill the tasks outlined above. Costs incurred&#13;
in the provision of training would be funded in addition to the basic fee for forming and&#13;
sustaining the SHGs. NGOs costs in promoting SHGs will vary depending on a number of&#13;
factors, including density of target population; number of SHGs which can be forned per&#13;
village; distance between the groups promoted; nature of terrain and transport services available;&#13;
characteristics of members, e.g., level of education and leadership potential; frequency and&#13;
timing of meetings; and educational qualification, and experience of the facilitator. Participating&#13;
NGOs would submit costed proposals for undertaking SHG development. For budgeting&#13;
purposes a fee of Rs. 5,500 per SHG per year has been used for the formation of new groups by&#13;
NGOs' and Rs. 3,000 where groups are promoted by mature SHGs. This would include the&#13;
overhead costs of the NGO. The distribution of expenditure between staff, operating expenses,&#13;
provision of capital equipment such as cycles or mopeds for the field workers, etc. would be at&#13;
the discretion of the NGO. In practice, the appropriate fee should be determined in relation to&#13;
the specific circumstances of each NGO and the area in which it is operating.&#13;
With the exception of UP where the existence of large villages enabling the formation of 3-5 groups/village and the&#13;
demonstration effect from the on-going program will allow for substantial savings in costs - an allowance of Rs, 1,300 per&#13;
group for LDC managed districts and Rs. 3,200 for WWC managed districts has been made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-107-&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
10.         The suggested performance criteria against which payment of fees would be made&#13;
to the NGOs are as follows:&#13;
(a)   After 6 months - group is meeting regularly with an average of 80% attendance,&#13;
group is saving regularly, basic records are being maintained, group&#13;
representatives have been identified, one of the group members' training modules&#13;
has been completed;&#13;
(b)   After 12 months - all members are engaged in savings; loaning has commenced;&#13;
transactions are documented satisfactorily; recovery is consistently over 90%;&#13;
attendance is consistently over 80%; members participate in meetings on a wide&#13;
scale; group representatives have been trained; group members have received the&#13;
second training module;&#13;
(c)   After 18 months - indicators as above plus group is in contact with a lending&#13;
institution for the provision of a group loan; group has identified a local person to&#13;
maintain the accounts and has begun to make contribution towards the payment of&#13;
this person;&#13;
(d)   After 24 months - indicators as in (b) plus group is able to substantially manage&#13;
the regular operations of the group and the need for regular attendance by the&#13;
NGO field worker has ceased; members taking up economic activities have&#13;
received skill development training related to the economic activity adopted.&#13;
(e)   Subsequent payments would be based on similar indicators.&#13;
11.         While these indicators represent the desired path of progress of the SHGs, care&#13;
needs to be exercised that the NGOs do not prejudice the long term sustainability of the groups&#13;
through pushing them to attain these targets before they are ready just to ensure that they receive&#13;
the fee. A case by case assessment would be made by the WDC district staff of SHGs which&#13;
have not attained these performance criteria and, where there are legitimate reasons for the SHG&#13;
proceeding at a slower pace and the group is judged to be basically on course to become a viable&#13;
group, payment would be sanctioned.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
SHG CLUSTERS AND ASSOCIATIONS&#13;
Rationale&#13;
1.          The formation of clusters of SHGs (CGs) and associations of clusters (ACs) at&#13;
appropriate levels can play an important role in the sustainability of the SHGs and the wider&#13;
replication of the SHG concept. Such representative bodies can provide the on-going support and&#13;
linkages which the SHGs require, whilst also being responsible for promoting the formation and&#13;
nurturing of further SHGs. This would contribute towards significantly reducing the social&#13;
intermediation costs involved in group development and make the whole process of expanding the&#13;
SHG concept more cost effective and replicable. Over time, these bodies can take over most of the&#13;
ftunctions performed by the NGOs and hence they provide a sound basis for withdrawal of NGO&#13;
support. CGs/ACs also represent a useful feature of the empowerment process broadening the&#13;
power base of women in addressing issues that affect them in a democratic manner.&#13;
Lessons Learnt from Past Experience&#13;
2.          Limited experience has been gained to date by a number of NGOs in the forrnation&#13;
of CGs/ACs both in the project states, (with the exception of Haryana) and elsewhere in the&#13;
country. This has highlighted a number of important lessons which are likely to be important&#13;
factors in the development of CGs/ACs. The key factors in the formation of CGs/ACs are&#13;
summarized below:&#13;
(a)  it is essential that CGs/ACs emerge naturally based on demand generated from the&#13;
SHGs as they come to appreciate the utility and importance of these bodies and are&#13;
in a position to control them. If the foundations of the SHGs are laid well through&#13;
providing opportunities for inter-action between groups e.g. through joint trainings&#13;
of group members and representatives and member conferences, this process is&#13;
likely to occur;&#13;
(b)   identifying and training the leaders who are ready to motivate is important for&#13;
sustaining the momentum;&#13;
(c)   the closer the geographic proximity of the groups, (involving little of no transport&#13;
costs), the greater the chances of their coming together;&#13;
(d)   SHGs should be located in the service area of a bank branch which helps to&#13;
strengthen further linkages with the lending institution;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-110-&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
(e)   CGs/ACs must fix their own criteria for membership and admission procedures - in&#13;
general, only a group that is stable and working well can join;&#13;
(f)    member groups should pay an admission fee and annual regular contribution to&#13;
cover operating costs;&#13;
(g)   the size of CGs consisting of 15-20 SHGs (200-500 members) and ACs of 4-8&#13;
clusters (60-160 SHGs) has been found effective;&#13;
(h)   the process of forming an AC needs to be approached with caution as there are&#13;
dangers in these larger bodies becoming politicized, particularly if they become&#13;
financial institutions; and&#13;
(i)   the formation of clusters can be expected to start within the first 18-30 months after&#13;
the formation of the SHGs. The ACs would come up at a later stage - after 3-4&#13;
years.&#13;
Roles of CGs/ACs&#13;
4.          CGs/ACs can play a variety of functions depending on demand and capacity to&#13;
provide effective support in areas ranging from providing a forum for collective action and&#13;
promoting awareness building and collective learning to supplying services or acting as a financial&#13;
intermediary. Some of the important functions which these bodies can perform can be broadly&#13;
categorized as follows:&#13;
A. Sharing of Experiences and Collective Action&#13;
(i)   collective knowledge building and leadership&#13;
(ii)   supporting weak groups&#13;
(iii)  solving of inter-group and intra-group disputes/problems&#13;
(iv)   promoting new groups&#13;
(v)   training of SHG members/leaders in running of SHGs;&#13;
(vi)   monitoring SHGs' progress towards empowerment of its members&#13;
(vii)  lobbying for policy changes and resource mobilisation (government funds, schemes,&#13;
bank funds)&#13;
(viii) promoting representation of SHGs in appropriate fora&#13;
B. Management of Business Activities and Provision of Technical and Marketing Services&#13;
(i)   business activities such as purchase of inputs/raw materials and marketing to&#13;
benefit from economies of scale, either directly or through promoting business&#13;
associations or producer groups among members in the CG/AC engaged in the same&#13;
on-farm or non-farm activity;&#13;
(ii)  training in business promotion activities (e.g. market surveys, costing, designing);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-1 11 -&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
C. Provision of Financial Services1&#13;
(i)   audit facilities;&#13;
(ii)  inter-group lending of surplus funds generated by some groups to member groups&#13;
wishing to borrow additional funds;&#13;
(iii)  financial intermediary on behalf of banks, receiving larger loans to be passed on as&#13;
smaller loans to the member SHGs; and&#13;
(iv)  provision of specific purpose saving and credit services.&#13;
D. Provision of Social Services&#13;
(i)    management of certain community services (creche, maintenance of drinking water&#13;
supply); and&#13;
(ii)   provision of social security schemes e.g. life insurance, cattle insurance, health care,&#13;
economic security schemes for women.&#13;
5.           The roles mentioned in sections B, C and D demand a higher level of expertise than&#13;
the roles mentioned in section A. These different roles can be played at either the Cluster or&#13;
Association of Cluster level. The role which each CG/AC will perform will be deternined by&#13;
demand and the capacity of the human resources available and would depend on:&#13;
(i)   strength of the member groups&#13;
(ii)   leadership available to the cluster/association of clusters&#13;
(iii)  socio-economic conditions in which the SHGs are working&#13;
(iv)   vision of the groups and of the NGOs promoting them&#13;
(v)   expertise and resources available with the NGOs or the capacity to access resources&#13;
Financing of CGs/ACs&#13;
6.           The level of costs incurred to maintain a CG/AC depends on the roles performed&#13;
which in turn determines the complement of staff which a CG/AC requires. For sustainability,&#13;
mechanisms for covering the costs through annual contributions, service fees, or comrnission need&#13;
to be established from the outset. However, these charges have to be set at a level which enables&#13;
individual SHGs/members to derive a benefit. The roles described in section A can largely be&#13;
handled by the CG/AC representatives on a voluntary basis. CGs/ACs acting as financial&#13;
intermnediaries, although requiring a higher and more professional level of staffing (2-3 staff&#13;
including 1 professional and 1 accountant), have a ready mechanism for cost recovery through the&#13;
interest margin. With a volume of lending of Rs. 5 million and an interest margin of 6-9%, such a&#13;
CG/AC can be self-sufficient. Careful analysis of the cost of funds and potential lending terms&#13;
would be required to be undertaken by any CG/AC intending to act as a financial intermediary to&#13;
The project would insist on strict external audit procedures for any CGs/ACs functioning as financial&#13;
intermediaries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-112-&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
ensure that an adequate interest spread would be available to cover costs. CGs/ACs providing&#13;
commercial services, such as inputs supply would need to charge commission to cover the costs of&#13;
making the arrangements. Covering the costs of technical and social services through charges may&#13;
initially be more difficult but there is increasing evidence that SHG members are willing to pay for&#13;
services which they find useful.&#13;
Role of NGOs in Promoting CGs/ACs&#13;
7.          The role of the NGO is very crucial in facilitating the emergence of CGs/ACs.&#13;
Although the initial motivation must come from the SHG members, thereafter the SHGs need&#13;
support and guidance from the NGOs to operationalize the concept. The orientation of the NGOs is&#13;
also important as it is essential that the NGOs have confidence in the SHG members' ability to&#13;
promote and maintain cluster and association structures. They must be ready to see that their&#13;
functions reduce year by year and the SHGs have freedom to take intiative so that CGs/ACs&#13;
become an effective part of a gradual withdrawal strategy.&#13;
Project Interventions&#13;
8.          Development of Guidelines for the Formation of CGs/ACs The project would&#13;
promote the emergence of CGs/ACs on a pilot scale, commencing in those states where existing&#13;
mature SHGs are to be inducted into the project, principally UP and Kamataka. This work is&#13;
expected to commence during the second year of project implementation. As a prelude to this&#13;
process, the CPSU would commission a study by experienced management consultants with&#13;
financial expertise to analyse the experience of on-going experiments in the formation of CGs/ACs&#13;
in order to establish a set of guidelines for the use of NGOs in assisting the process amongst SHGs&#13;
whom they are supporting. The study would focus on the pros and cons of the different roles which&#13;
the CGs/ACs can play; the institutional framework including staffing and organizational procedures&#13;
required in relation to the different roles; possible financing arrangements to ensure cost recovery&#13;
and sustainability; and the inputs required for capacity building of the CGs/ACs including training,&#13;
expert guidance and back-up support. Terms of reference for the study are given in Attachment 1.&#13;
The guidelines are not intended to be prescriptive but to establish a framework of the essential&#13;
organizational features required for the operation of CGs/ACs performing different functions within&#13;
which the modus operandi can evolve to meet the specific needs of different groups of SHGs.&#13;
9.          Support to Facilitate the Formation of CGs/ACs The Project would provide the&#13;
following support to facilitate the formnation of CGs/ACs: - (i) provision of expert guidance through&#13;
consultancy inputs from experienced NGOs and/or other agencies in the development of&#13;
institutional structures for CGs/ACs and in support of the specific roles which CGs/ACs may wish&#13;
to play e.g. undertaking market surveys, designing specific purpose saving scheme; (ii) provision of&#13;
orientation and training to the NGOs in the functioning of CGs/ACs; (iii) provision of leadership&#13;
training and exposure visits for CGs/ACs leaders; and (iv) support for networking amongst the&#13;
CGs/ACs both within and outside of the project. The support provided by the NGOs in the&#13;
promotion of CGs/ACs would form part of the overall provision under the project for NGO&#13;
support to sustaining SHGs. (As the SHGs mature, the focus of the NGO would switch from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-113-&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
individual groups to fostering the management of the CGs/ACs). At the outset, a workshop would&#13;
be organized by CPSU for the WDCGs and participating NGOs in the states which will be&#13;
launching the experiment (with other WDCGs as observers), drawing on the resources of NGOs'&#13;
nationwide with experience of CGs/ACs.&#13;
10.         Learning from Implementation Experience As CGs/ACs are a recent&#13;
phenomenon emerging in the last 5-8 years, little documentation is available on the process. As the&#13;
project would generate valuable experience, emphasis would be placed on documenting the&#13;
processes as part of the overall M&amp;E system. A data base on all CGs/ACs promoted under the&#13;
project would be maintained. Possible areas of documentation would include:&#13;
(i)   background of the SHGs in terms of age of groups, membership composition,&#13;
motivation for SHG formation, and systems built up within the groups;&#13;
(ii)  the process of cluster formation and association formation, difficulties faced and&#13;
how they were tackled;&#13;
(iii)  roles performed by the CGs/ACs;&#13;
(iv)   organizational structures of the CGs/ACs - division of labor, accountability and&#13;
decision making;&#13;
(v)   role of facilitating organization in training/exchanges; other human resource&#13;
development, support in kind, linkages, finance; and&#13;
(vi)  costs of promotion and building of sustainable CGs/ACs.&#13;
I1.         The experiences of participating NGOs and other NGOs nationwide involved in&#13;
sponsoring CGs/ACs would be drawn upon and the experiences would be shared in inter-state&#13;
workshops. An advisory committee would be set up to coordinate the program with membership&#13;
from the CPSU; lead M&amp;E agency; each WDC participating in this experiment; 3 representatives&#13;
(in rotation) from NGOs sponsoring CGs/ACs under the project, 3 representatives (in rotation)&#13;
from other NGOs nationwide with experience of CGs/ACs e.g. Leads (Trichey, Kerala), Chaitanya&#13;
(Pune, Maharashtra), Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA, Ahmedabad), Mysore&#13;
Rehabilitation and Development Agency (MYRADA, Tamil Nadu), Professional Assistance for&#13;
Development Action (PRADAN - Madurai, Tamil Nadu); and representatives of CGs/ACs. An&#13;
initial workshop would be held to launch the documentation process. This workshop should&#13;
conclude with an action plan for each state. Organizations which may be interested in documenting&#13;
these experiences would include Friends of Women's World Banking (FWWB), Banker's Institute&#13;
for Rural Development (BIRD) and SPARC.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
MOBILIZATION OF FUNDS BY SHGs&#13;
A. Credit and the Rural Poor&#13;
1.          Despite the vast expansion of the formal credit structure in India, the dependence&#13;
of the rural poor on moneylenders continues,1 especially for meeting emergency credit&#13;
requirements. Some of the major causes lie in the difficulties formal institutions face in dealing&#13;
effectively and economically with a large number of small borrowers who require credit&#13;
frequently and in small quantities; limitations imposed by the legal framework on their&#13;
operations and bankers' perceptions of the risks and creditworthiness of these borrowers. Such&#13;
dependence is even more pronounced in the case of women in view of the additional constraints&#13;
imposed by gender discrimination. The major social factors which hinder women's access to&#13;
formal credit include their low level of literacy and numeracy, their general lack of exposure and&#13;
contact with the world outside their immediate environs, unfamiliarity with bureaucratic&#13;
procedures and the unsympathetic attitudes of bank functionaries. Women's access is also&#13;
limited by high borrower transaction costs and lack of collateral. Women's demand for credit&#13;
requires a system which allows them to engage in risk-averse, multi-production strategies,&#13;
provides for small loans with the minimum of procedures and allows repayment of loans in&#13;
frequent, small installments.&#13;
2.           To overcome these hurdles, thrift and credit Self-Help Groups (SHGs) have been&#13;
promoted, particularly among women.2 These groups initially draw on their own accumulated&#13;
savings to provide loans principally to meet consumption and emergency needs, thereby&#13;
removing women from exploitation by moneylenders. As a credit delivery system, SHGs bring&#13;
the benefits of flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of the borrower. They act as both&#13;
moneylender, advancing small loans quickly, and development banker, providing small amounts&#13;
of production credit, whilst following the principles of participation and mutual cooperation.&#13;
SHGs enable women to gain experience of managing credit and to leam credit discipline.&#13;
However, the ability of SHGs to meet the financial needs of their members rapidly outgrows the&#13;
limitations of their own resources. In recognition of this, the National Bank for Agriculture and&#13;
Rural Development (NABARD) has spearheaded systems to link the SHGs with the formal&#13;
credit system.&#13;
Around 63% of households depend on informal sources of credit - these are predominantly poor, non-&#13;
cultivator households - All India Debt and Investment Survey (1981-82)&#13;
2  Details on the functioning of SHGs are given in Annex 4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-116-&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
B. Role of SHGs in Accessing Institutional Credit&#13;
3.           After initial hesitancy, the formal financial sector is gradually recognizing the&#13;
importance of linking SHGs with their own operations. Linking SHGs with banks has been&#13;
shown to be a cost-effective, transparent and flexible approach to improve the accessibility of&#13;
credit from the formal banking system to the unreached rural poor. Lending to SHGs offers the&#13;
banks a much needed solution to the twin problems being faced by banks, viz., recovery of loans&#13;
in rural areas and the high transaction costs of dealing with small borrowers at frequent intervals.&#13;
The provision of credit through SHGs reduces the direct transaction costs of the banks by 40-60&#13;
percent as a major task of appraisal, supervision and recovery of the loan is taken over by the&#13;
group itself. However, the major contributory factor is the improvement in the recovery rate.&#13;
Repayment rates of loans to SHGs are around 95 percent compared with recovery rates on&#13;
individual loans to the target group under the poverty alleviation programs such as the Integrated&#13;
Rural Development Program (IRDP) of 30-50 percent. As shown in Attachment 1, the total&#13;
transaction costs of the banks (including default risk) are reduced from 34 percent when lending&#13;
to individuals to 11 percent when lending to SHGs.3&#13;
4.           The transaction costs for the borrowers are also substantially reduced through&#13;
being able to access credit in the village without having to make several time consuming&#13;
journeys to the bank branch. Studies have indicated the overall reduction in the borrower's&#13;
transaction costs to be 85 percent.&#13;
C. NABARD Initiative&#13;
5.           Pilot program. To foster this approach, NABARD launched a pilot program in&#13;
1992 for linking the SHGs with the banks. This followed the issue of instructions by the&#13;
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in July 1991 which allow banks to finance informal and&#13;
unregistered groups without collateral whilst giving SHGs the liberty to decide their own terms&#13;
and conditions for financial transactions. Banks are increasingly getting involved in financing&#13;
SHGs. The pilot program achieved considerable success and has covered around 5,000 groups as&#13;
against the original target of 500 SHGs The repayment performance of the loans taken by the&#13;
groups has been more than 95 percent. Eighty percent of the groups were formed by women.&#13;
6.           Future directions. Encouraged by the success of the pilot program, RBI has&#13;
made financing of SHGs by the banks a part of their general priority sector lending. Banks are&#13;
being encouraged by RBI to treat the linkage program as a business opportunity for reaching the&#13;
rural poor and to make it part of their corporate strategy. The guidelines issued in April 1996&#13;
formalise some of the innovations which have been developed during the pilot phase to simplify&#13;
procedures. In particular, the guidelines make provision for banks to provide cash credit limits4&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-117-&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
to the SHGs - a system which has been pioneered by the UP Land Development Corporation&#13;
under the Sodic Lands Reclamation Project. The guidelines also remove many of the doubts in&#13;
the minds of bankers and set proper procedures and documentation for SHG financing.&#13;
Adherence to the service area is not mandatory and SHGs/NGOs may deal with a branch other&#13;
than the service area branch. The instructions issued by RBI clarify the situation regarding&#13;
defaulters, assuring the banks that the defaults by a few members of SHGs and/or their family&#13;
members to the financing banks should not ordinarily come in the way of financing the SHG,&#13;
provided the SHG itself is not in default to the bank. However, the bank loan may not be utilized&#13;
by the SHG for financing a defaulter member to the bank. NABARD's support for training of&#13;
banks' staff as well as 100 percent refinancing has been assured. The RBI instructions encourage&#13;
the banks (commercial banks, regional rural banks and cooperative banks5) to step up their credit&#13;
to the unreached rural poor by extensively using the SHG route.&#13;
D. Lessons Learnt and Continuing Constraints&#13;
7.           The experience to date indicates that SHGs provide an effective mechanism for&#13;
demonstrating that the poor are bankable. The repayment rate on bank loans of over 90 percent&#13;
indicates that SHGs have the ability to manage credit and to impose credit discipline. The credit&#13;
and recovery performance of SHGs are better, as loans availed by members are self-chosen and&#13;
small-size manageable loans; credit is available in a timely manner; and loans availed by&#13;
members are need-based. At the same time, the close-knit nature of the group ensures proper&#13;
utilization of loans and peer pressure for repayment.&#13;
8.           However, despite the clear indications of success, a number of constraints still&#13;
remain. Despite the issue of guidelines and circulars, information does not always filter down to&#13;
the bank branches and many branch managers are still unaware of the scheme or do not fully&#13;
understand the flexibility it provides in lending to SHGs. Hence, continued effort is required to&#13;
orient both senior level bank management, particularly Regional Managers, and branch managers&#13;
and to train them in the provisions and procedures of the scheme. Even where bankers are aware&#13;
of the scheme, there is a need to instill confidence in the mechanism through facilitating contact&#13;
with existing SHGs which have been successfully linked with banks.&#13;
E. Project Interventions&#13;
9.           Mobilization of Funds. The project would assist SHG members to mobilize&#13;
funds for consumption and investment through inculcating the habit of savings and helping the&#13;
groups to access external sources of funds to augment their own resources in order to be able to&#13;
meet the needs of their members. To this end, the SHGs would be linked with banks to access&#13;
credit at market rates of interest preferably using the simplified flexible procedures offered by the&#13;
cash credit limit arrangements.&#13;
5  The participation of cooperative banks depends on the provision of the state cooperative laws/rules in regard to&#13;
financing informal groups and at present only Bihar amongst the participating states has this provision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-1 18-&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
10.         Capacity Building. (i) SHGs. Since the ability of the SHGs to access credit&#13;
from lending institutions rests on demonstrating their creditworthiness, the project would assist&#13;
the groups to establish a track record for sound financial management of their savings and credit&#13;
operations through provision of training in credit management and maintenance of accounts and&#13;
ensuring regular audits of the SHGs' accounts. (ii) NGOs. The project would strengthen the&#13;
capacity of the NGOs to support the SHGs through training in credit management and the&#13;
operating procedures of SHGs; and in appropriate simplified accounting systems to be&#13;
transmitted to the SHGs and through exposure visits to successful SHGs. (iii) Banks. Since&#13;
proper motivation and orientation of regional managers and branch managers is essential to&#13;
bank-SHG linkage, the project would fund one workshop per year for senior bank management&#13;
in each state to provide orientation to the SHG concept. For branch managers participating in the&#13;
project, orientation and review workshops would be held each year on a district basis. In&#13;
addition, both regional and branch managers would participate in exposure visits to successful&#13;
SHGs in order to instill confidence in the SHG mechanism. Provision is also made for two&#13;
international study tours per year per state for the best performing staff of the participating banks&#13;
and NABARD. Since NABARD has developed considerable expertise over the last four years in&#13;
propagating the concept of SHG financing by the banks, NABARD would be responsible for the&#13;
training of bank staff under the project.&#13;
11.         Special studies. Broadening of the savings base of the SHGs. At present,&#13;
members of SHGs have no direct access to their savings and in many SHGs, savings&#13;
contributions per member are fixed at a uniform rate. A study would be commissioned as part of&#13;
the M&amp;E system to examine the possibilities for broadening the savings base to allow members&#13;
to have direct access to their savings and to make additional savings contributions when they&#13;
have surplus funds and to allow the SHGs to accept savings/deposits from non-members.&#13;
Detailed consideration would need to be given to administrative arrangements, accounting&#13;
procedures, non-contravention of Banking Regulations Act, ways of protecting savers and likely&#13;
impacts on the cohesion of the SHG.&#13;
F. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
12.         Management of credit funds. The SHGs' savings and credit operations would&#13;
commence with generation of funds from the members' savings and internal loaning based on&#13;
these funds in order to establish a track record for sound credit management. Approximately 6-&#13;
12 months after formation, efforts would be made to link SHGs with a bank through establishing&#13;
cash credit limit arrangements. This system enables groups to establish a line of credit from the&#13;
bank up to an agreed limit, initially equivalent to their own savings, which they can draw on as&#13;
required for consumption and/or other purposes. This approach provides group members easy&#13;
access to bank credit with the minimum of processing formalities and restrictions on the use of&#13;
funds. The cash credit limit is gradually raised as a proportion of the group's savings, generally&#13;
up to a limit of 4 times, in line with the improving credit record of the group. In the UP&#13;
experience, SHGs have on average been sanctioned cash credit limits after the group has been in&#13;
existence for nine months. To simplify the procedures, the banks have sanctioned telescopic&#13;
limits on the basis of thirty six months savings and in a ratio of 1:4 and the banks revise the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-119-&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
withdrawal limit on a quarterly basis. In this way repeated revisions of the documentation are&#13;
avoided which minimizes expenditure and inconvenience to the group members. The cash credit&#13;
system is more beneficial to the groups than a term loan as the group only pays interest on the&#13;
amount of credit which it draws whilst with a term loan, the group is liable to pay interest on the&#13;
whole amount sanctioned irrespective of whether the group is able to utilize the money&#13;
immediately or not. Experience from UP indicates that interaction with bank staff on an&#13;
individual basis would be beneficial in encouraging the participation of banks in financing SHGs&#13;
and expediting adoption of the cash credit limit arrangements. Over time the group may decide&#13;
to switch to a group term loan or it may prefer to continue with the cash credit limit&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
13.          Wherever SHGs are unable to access this facility from a bank, they may be&#13;
provided with funds from other financial institutions provided that the terms and conditions are&#13;
consistent with market interest rates charged to the SHGs and the SHGs able to deternine the&#13;
interest rate to be charged to their members. Other possible lending institutions would include&#13;
FWWB, NABARD's provision of bulk loans to NGOs for on-lending to SHGs, RMK (once its&#13;
lending terms are appropriate 6) or other non-banking financial institutions.&#13;
14.          Credit requirement under the project. The total credit required to be provided&#13;
by the lending institutions under the project would be determined by the number of groups and&#13;
the savings capacity of the SHGs. An indicative profile of a typical SHG on which the&#13;
calculations have been based is given in Attachment 2. Whilst the project would not be target&#13;
driven, for planning purposes it has been estimated that around 7,400 SHGs are likely to be&#13;
formed during the project period. This number will include some existing groups, particularly in&#13;
UP and Karnataka which are already linked to the banks. Estimation of aggregate savings is&#13;
based on 20 members per SHG saving Rs. 15/month or Rs. 3,600/ SHG/year. The cash credit&#13;
facility is assumed to be accessed after nine months, matching the group's savings of Rs. 2,700 at&#13;
this point. The cash credit limit as a ratio of the savings is assumed to increase each year up to a&#13;
ratio of 1:4 in the fourth year. With the increase in the groups own resources (savings + net&#13;
interest earnings), the amount of credit which the group can access is estimated at around Rs.&#13;
100,000 in the fifth year. It is assumed that 90 percent of the SHGs formed in Years 1-4 would&#13;
be linked to a lending institution by the end of the project period. This profile of loans to the&#13;
SHGs has been used, taking into account the age profile of the groups, to estimate the aggregate&#13;
credit requirements under the project. This is estimated at Rs. 295 million (see Attachment 3 for&#13;
the state-wise and year-wise breakdown).&#13;
15.          Credit terms and conditions. Loans provided by the banks to the SHGs would&#13;
be based on the bank's assessment of the creditworthiness of the group and its track record in&#13;
6   The present constitution of RMK does not allow SHGs the flexibility to determine interest rates but requires&#13;
RMK funds to be lent to the final borrower at an interest rate not exceeding 12%.&#13;
7 The likely spread between the states is Bihar - 600, Gujarat - 1,200, Haryana - 600, Karnataka - 1,200, Madhya&#13;
Pradesh - 1,000 and Uttar Pradesh - 2,800.&#13;
8   Calculations for UP and Haryana are based on 15 members per SHG and monthly savings of Rs. 15 per&#13;
member.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-120-&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
credit management. The lending institutions would be encouraged to provide cash credit&#13;
arrangements to SHGs. Lending terms and conditions to the final borrower would be determined&#13;
by the SHG, including the decision to finance a particular member, the purpose of loan, loan&#13;
amount, repayment period and interest rate. The appraisal of the beneficiary and the activity,&#13;
utilization and recovery of loans to members are the sole responsibility of the SHG. The bank&#13;
would be free to set its own interest on loans to SHGs. The SHG would determine the interest&#13;
rate charged on loans to its members. Most SHGs charge interest rates of 2-3 percent per month.&#13;
Any policy changes relevant to this project resulting from the Bank's on-going dialogue with&#13;
GOI on the rural sector reform program would be made applicable to the project's credit&#13;
activities.&#13;
D. Profile of SHG Savings and Credit Operations&#13;
16.         The profile of the model SHG given in Attachment 3 indicates the viability of an&#13;
SHG's savings and credit operations. It is assumed from Year 2 that the SHG will be fully&#13;
responsible for all the costs of its operations, including payment to a person to maintain the&#13;
accounts if this cannot be done by a group member and purchase of ledgers and other stationery.&#13;
These costs have been estimated at Rs. 600 per year. The analysis shows that with net interest&#13;
earnings in the second year of Rs. 1, 330 the group is easily able to cover these costs. By the&#13;
fifth year, net interest earnings are of the order of Rs. 10,000 per year. By the end of five years,&#13;
the average amount of credit available per member is around Rs. 6,000 and the average equity&#13;
capital per member amounts to over Rs. 1,300.&#13;
17.         Key features of SHGs' lending operations. Based on past experience with&#13;
SHGs in India, it is anticipated that the initial uses of credit would be for consumption, social and&#13;
health needs. This slowly shifts towards productive investment. The limited available data&#13;
indicate clearly defined trends in the pattern of lending by SHGs although the dimensions vary&#13;
considerably between groups depending on their circumstances. A broad-based study conducted&#13;
by NABARD revealed that while in the first year around 70-80 percent of the SHG credit goes&#13;
for consumption purposes and the remaining 20-30 percent for production and investment needs,&#13;
by the third year the position is reversed with consumption credit forming only 20-30 percent and&#13;
credit for productive purposes increasing to 70-80 percent.9 Data available on a sample of the&#13;
MYRADA sponsored groups indicates a similar trend with loans for consumption decreasing&#13;
from 46 percent of the number of loans granted (for SHGs less than 2 years old) to 26 percent&#13;
(for SHGs 3-5 years old). In terms of the total value of loans, the corresponding reduction in the&#13;
share of consumption was from 20 percent to 12 percent (see Attachment 4). SHGs rotate their&#13;
savings between 1 and 2 times per year but the figure can be as high as four times. For purposes&#13;
of analysis of SHG operations under the project, a conservative set of assumptions have been&#13;
used. These comprise: (i) the percentage of lending from the group generating incremental&#13;
economic benefits increases from 15 percent to 40 percent as the group matures; (ii) the rotation&#13;
of investment funds decreases from twice to 1.5 times per year; and (iii) 85 percent of the value&#13;
of production loans represents on-farm activities and 15 percent is for non-farm activities.&#13;

Comprehensive data on the lending operations of the SHGs would be collected by the M&amp;E&#13;
system to improve the data base on group behavior.&#13;
18.          On the basis of the experience of existing groups, initial production loans are for&#13;
traditional oN-farm activities such as inputs like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and implements;&#13;
livestock, particularly sheep and goats, and sericulture. Traditional off-farm activities would&#13;
include trading, shops and traditional handicrafts. The real diversification into higher income&#13;
generating activities would only come after 2-3 years and for this to take place on any significant&#13;
scale, past experience indicates that there is a need for other technical assistance inputs such as&#13;
awareness and entrepreneurship and skill development training.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION IN ON-FARM ACTIVITIES&#13;
Strategy&#13;
1.          Experience of existing SHGs indicates that over 50 percent of the credit is used for&#13;
agriculture - for improved inputs (seeds, fertilizer), and small livestock. Investments in on-farm&#13;
activities would target three categories of women: (a) landless women with access to small&#13;
amounts of land around the homestead; (b) women with access to both homestead and field land&#13;
who are currently engaged in subsistence production; and (c) women with land who are already&#13;
engaged in cash crop production.&#13;
2.          Women would be assisted first to consolidate the food security base of the&#13;
household and then embark on a growth path through improvements in crop and animal&#13;
productivity and onto diversification. This work would begin with activities that increase the&#13;
sustainability of predominantly rainfed agriculture through the introduction of improved land and&#13;
water conservation activities. As group members progressively wish to optimize returns from&#13;
limited resources, extension support would be provided to introduce activities with potential for&#13;
greater economic realization such as cultivation of herbs, spices, fruits, vegetables and&#13;
floriculture. To minimize risk, only known technologies, which the women and their families&#13;
have been unable to access, would be promoted. Attempts would also be made to introduce the&#13;
women into market processes and other activities, e.g., storage, grading and packing, that add&#13;
value to the basic agricultural cycle.&#13;
3.          Livestock activities would focus on sheep and goats in small units which can be&#13;
easily managed by women alongside their other work. Necessary support would include the&#13;
dissemination of improved feeding practices and greater emphasis on fodder production and&#13;
animal health.&#13;
4.          To improve the terms on which women participate in markets, the project would&#13;
encourage the formation, later in the life of the project, of inter-SHG commodity&#13;
groups/producer associations focused on the production, processing and marketing of one&#13;
product and its by-products with SHGs taking responsibility for the running costs. Women&#13;
would also be introduced to new technology which could help to reduce the drudgery involved in&#13;
many agricultural tasks and food preparation.&#13;
5.          Potential investment opportunities. Given the wide variations in the resource&#13;
base across the project states and districts, the specific opportunities open to women will be&#13;
location specific . Hence, the project approach for land-based activities will necessarily have to be&#13;
flexible to accommodate local needs. In general, separate lines of action would be required for&#13;
semi-arid rainfed and largely rainfed areas (e.g., Panchmahals, Kolar, Chitradurga, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-128-&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Hoshangabad) and for better endowed areas (e.g., Muzuffarpur, Sehore, Sabarkantha and Ranchi).&#13;
An indication of possible opportunities in the initial project districts is given below:&#13;
(a)   Bihar. In dry areas, emphasis would be on moisture conservation measures;&#13;
expanding irrigation through water storage ponds and lift irrigation; improving the&#13;
productivity of homestead gardens; small animal management; post-harvesting&#13;
value addition; and access to larger markets through group marketing. Wasteland is&#13;
available in the hinterland of villages which could provide opportunities for group-&#13;
managed horticulture (guava, mango).&#13;
(b)   Gujarat. In Panchmahals, the primary action required is in-situ soil and moisture&#13;
conservation followed by improving the productivity of the traditional crop cycles&#13;
through green manuring, mulching and composting to ensure food security. For&#13;
income generation, dryland horticulture (ber/lac, amla, custard apple) with garlic&#13;
and ginger production and processing on homesteads and small animal management&#13;
for egg and meat production are possible starting points.&#13;
(c)   Haryana. Assured moisture in the rainfed areas will allow farmers to tap flower&#13;
and vegetable markets in Delhi, in addition to focusing on traditional cereals,&#13;
oilseed crops and potatoes. Tapping specialist and non-traditional markets such as&#13;
organic produce and cheeses offer other possibilities.&#13;
(d)   Karnataka. Most of the project area is characterised by low rainfall, poor&#13;
irrigation and inferior degraded soils. Little homestead land is available and initial&#13;
effort should be on improvements of field land through soil and water conservation&#13;
followed by consolidating the productivity of traditional field crops such as paddy&#13;
and millets, and dryland vegetables and horticulture. Linkage with existing&#13;
programs for catchment area management will be important. Ready marketing&#13;
opportunities offered by proximity to Bangalore provide scope for diversification&#13;
into high value crops (floriculture, vegetables, mango, pomegranate, jamun),&#13;
product processing (jams, pickles, condiments) and group marketing.&#13;
(e)   Madhya Pradesh. Improving productivity of homesteads, enabling access to&#13;
markets for minor agricultural produce, and value added activities such as flour&#13;
milling, grading and sorting, sun-drying, condiment-making are promising entry&#13;
points. In rainfed areas, possibilities exist for vegetable production, mushroom&#13;
growing and raising small animals (poultry, rabbits, quails) on homestead land.&#13;
(f)    Uttar Pradesh. Home-based value addition through medicinal plants, fodder,&#13;
mushroom cultivation and minor horticulture (lime) offer promising entry points.&#13;
Group management of wasteland for prosopis plantations for charcoal making&#13;
would be a possibility. The presence of the Land Development Corporation as a&#13;
partner would allow a more holistic approach to improving land and water resources&#13;
before embarking on agriculture and animal husbandry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-129-&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Financial models for a range of indicative activities are given in Annex 18.&#13;
Approach&#13;
6.          Participatory planning processes. The NGOs would promote inter-active&#13;
discussions between the women and the agricultural extension staff to assist women in the&#13;
identification of strategies and selection of activities which meet their specific needs. These&#13;
exercises would build on women's indigenous knowledge in conjunction with information on&#13;
available resources (land, family labor), women's work cycles, seasonal pattern of demand for&#13;
women's labor, women's perceptions and priorities, e.g., on food security versus cash income and&#13;
concerns regarding their roles within the family and community. Based on these exercises,&#13;
prioritised lines of actions addressing women's needs would be developed which would also&#13;
identify the support required in terms of training, exposure to technology, access to inputs and&#13;
development of market linkages.&#13;
7.          Consolidation of soil and water resources. As most of the women have&#13;
predominantly rainfed land, assurance of soil moisture would expand the range of opportunities.&#13;
The project would support the identification of locally suitable soil and moisture conservation&#13;
practices and their implementation with the support from the NGOs and line departments.&#13;
Typically, these measures would involve earthen contour bunds, trenching, diversion drains, nala&#13;
drains and percolation ponds, requiring labor and materials readily available to the household.&#13;
Exposure trips to watershed development projects would be arranged to expand women's&#13;
understanding of the impact of such measures.&#13;
8.          Improving productivity. To enhance the productivity of homestead lands, the&#13;
project would promote such interventions as: (i) soil improvement by green manuring, mulching,&#13;
vermicomposting; (ii) bund and border planting of fodder; (iii) hedge-cropping of legumes; (iv)&#13;
improved intercropping and crop rotation practices; and (v) promoting new vegetable crops and&#13;
small fruit tree cultivation. The lessons could subsequently be tried on the main fields.&#13;
9.          Diversification into high value crops. The choices for diversification into high&#13;
value crops both on homestead lands and fields would be based on ecological and social&#13;
considerations (e.g., impact of cash cropping on women's involvement in management and control&#13;
of income) as well as market demand. Activities that could emerge as viable would include&#13;
vegetables, floriculture, medicinal plants, herbs and spices. SHGs could consider group leasing of&#13;
common or government land for agricultural development, particularly for quick-yielding and&#13;
hardy crops like moringa or horticultural crops. The project would support exposure visits to&#13;
successful farmers and institutions to view these developments.&#13;
10.         Animal improvement and management. As tending livestock is primarily the&#13;
women's domain, lending for livestock is popular amongst SHG members, primarily for small&#13;
livestock. However, returns from livestock are frequently low due to the low productivity of the&#13;
animals and hence women would be assisted to acquire the necessary knowledge and access to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-130-&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
facilities to make their animals productive. Typical livestock activities are likely to be: (a) goat&#13;
rearing indicatively based on three does with a buck shared by a number of women in the SHG; (b)&#13;
goat kid fattening indicatively based on 5 kids and involving a 10 month rearing period; (c) lamb&#13;
fattening indicatively based on three lambs and involving a three-month fattening period enabling&#13;
at least three cycles of fattening to be completed within a year; (d) piggery particular amongst SC&#13;
communities; and (e) group poultry units of 500 layer birds in later stages of SHG development. In&#13;
the course of the participatory planning process, Animal Husbandry staff would assist the SHGs to&#13;
consider the crucial issues of availability of fodder, access to veterinary services, disease&#13;
management, marketing outlets and opportunities for value addition through processing. Since&#13;
many households may already have dairy cattle, women would be assisted to upgrade the&#13;
productivity of their existing animals through improved nutrition, health care and upgradation of&#13;
the stock.&#13;
11.         Processing of agricultural and animal products. Processing of products would&#13;
be promoted to increase storage life of perishable products, increase marketability and add value.&#13;
The initial focus would be on simple methods such as grading, sorting and packaging and&#13;
upgrading of on-going processing activities in the project areas such as sun-drying, pickling and&#13;
condiment-making. Thereafter, the NGOs, with the assistance of specialist inputs, would help&#13;
SHGs to identify new processing potentials with traditional and new products. Improved methods&#13;
of marketing would also be explored including linkages with urban marketing chain stores to&#13;
ensure guaranteed uptake of produce and stable pricing.&#13;
12.         Commodity Marketing and Producer Groups. To improve the terms on which&#13;
women participate in markets, the project would encourage the formation, later in the life of the&#13;
project, of inter-SHG commodity groups/producer associations focused on the production,&#13;
processing and marketing of one product and its by-products. The activities of these groups would&#13;
include, as appropriate, input management, common storage facilities, grading and packaging,&#13;
group marketing, market research and market outlet development, joint market negotiation and&#13;
transport organization. As the establishment of these institutions would take place once the SHGs&#13;
are mature and have established links with the banks, it is expected that any fixed and working&#13;
capital requirements involved would attract loans from the banks. The project would provide&#13;
support in the form of consultancy inputs to assess viability and design appropriate institutional&#13;
structures for these organizations. (See also Annex 6 which describes the possible role of SHG&#13;
clusters or Associations in forming and sustaining such groups)&#13;
13.         Technologies for drudgery reduction and increasing efficiency. To increase&#13;
women's productivity in routine agricultural/domestic tasks and assist in releasing women's time&#13;
for more productive activities, the project would fund demonstrations of implements, equipment&#13;
and techniques to increase efficiency and save time devoted to on-farm activities. Sourcing of&#13;
available appropriate technologies from various technology development institutes and specialist&#13;
NGOs nationwide would be undertaken by the CPSU and information fed to the participating&#13;
states.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-131-&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Project Inputs&#13;
14.         Training. Initial training would be provided to all women in a group taking up&#13;
land based, including livestock, activities. Most of the training would be provided in the village.&#13;
The line departments would be the main source of training inputs supplemented by outside experts&#13;
where necessary. Training requirements would be identified and integrated with the overall&#13;
training plan.&#13;
15.   Technical Support. To promote the self-reliance of the groups, the project would support&#13;
the development of resource persons selected by the groups from amongst their own members or&#13;
from within the community to provide technical support to on-farm activities. With villages under&#13;
the project selected on a cluster basis, some resource persons would be able to be more specialised,&#13;
e.g., in specific crops or horticulture and serve neighbouring villages. Some would be trained as&#13;
para-vets to support animal husbandry activities. Intensive initial training, supplemented by annual&#13;
refresher training, would be provided to the resource persons in all important, easy-to-understand&#13;
technologies. Additional technical support would be provided by the line department extension&#13;
staff or by other agencies/consultants, e.g., NGOs who have technical staff, Agricultural&#13;
Universities, Krishi Vigan Kendras (KVK) who would be contracted by the WDCs.&#13;
16.         The NGOs would regularly compile a list of the services required by the women&#13;
in the groups which they are supporting and forward it to the WDC District Project Manager&#13;
(DPM) who would be responsible for identifying the appropriate service provider and making&#13;
the necessary arrangements for the delivery of the required inputs. For services to be provided&#13;
by the local extension staff, a detailed program would be worked out at the Cluster Level&#13;
Working Group meetings. The NGO would be responsible for following up with the identified&#13;
service provider to ensure the delivery of the required services. Any problems encountered&#13;
would be fed back to the DPM to resolve the matter through discussions at the district level or at&#13;
the District Project Coordinating Committee meeting.&#13;
17.         Demonstrations. On-farm demonstrations of technology packages for different&#13;
crops would be conducted by the resource person assisted by the line department field staff. The&#13;
demonstrations would be taken up on the fields of women group members and the project would&#13;
fund the cost of the inputs required. Demonstrations would focus on the technologies and crops&#13;
pertinent to the particular locality. These could include in-situ soil and moisture conservation; crop&#13;
production; vegetable/flower cultivation; kitchen gardens; techniques such as green manuring and&#13;
composting; fodder production, animal nutrition and animal care. On average it is proposed that&#13;
each year one demonstration of each appropriate category would be carried out in a cluster of 10-&#13;
20 villages. The first year would be spent in making preparatory arrangements with demonstrations&#13;
mounted each year thereafter.&#13;
18.        Exposure visits. SHG women, together with the resource persons, would make&#13;
visits to successful farmers or institutes to enable them to see the actual application of technologies&#13;
and their impact on productivity and income. The project would also support the visit of successful&#13;
farmers to the SHG members. These model farmers could also assist in the laying out of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-132-&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
demonstrations. As the project develops, successful farmers would be identified from amongst the&#13;
women participating in the project.&#13;
19.        Access to Infrastructure Support Under On-going Programs. Infrastructure&#13;
support for activities such as, soil conservation, watershed protection measures, irrigation wells,&#13;
and other irrigation schemes would be accessed through drawing on existing government&#13;
programmes. To this end the WDCs would prepare an inventory of all the government schemes in&#13;
areas of interest to the project. The WDC at the district level would be active in seeking to gain&#13;
nomination for project women for the infrastructure required and would seek to obtain a&#13;
commitment for an agreed allocation of relevant schemes to women. In states where development&#13;
schemes are being implemented through the panchayati raj institutions, SHGs would be helped to&#13;
develop synergies with these institutions in order to access these programs.&#13;
20.         Advisory Services. The project would assist SHG members with necessary advice&#13;
and guidance in the implementation of new initiatives, e.g., formation of producers associations or&#13;
other involvements in processing and marketing, through contracting short term inputs from&#13;
appropriate experts.&#13;
Potential Service Providers&#13;
21.         The technical line departments would be the principal providers of training and&#13;
other technical support services to women undertaking on-farm activities. The principal&#13;
departments involved and their responsibilities are outlined below.&#13;
22.         Agriculture. The Agricultural Department Extension Worker (or other designated&#13;
service provider) would be responsible for: (a) engaging in participatory assessments of the&#13;
resource base available to women, and their perceptions and priorities, identifying crop options and&#13;

(f) visiting women farmers at key times to review progress of their crops and provide additional&#13;
technical guidance; and (g) organising group action for marketing where appropriate.&#13;
23.         Horticulture. The Horticulture Department (or other designated service&#13;
provider) would be responsible for: (a) engaging in participatory assessments of the resource base&#13;
available to women, and their perceptions and priorities, identifying crop options and providing&#13;
guidance to women in the selection of appropriate crops; (b) training women taking up&#13;
horticulture activities; (c) training resource persons; (d) providing technical details and guidance&#13;
on laying of demonstration plots; (e) providing technical guidance on plantation establishment&#13;
including digging of pits, spacing, planting of seedlings, etc.; (f) providing guidance in the&#13;
establishment of nurseries or facilitating access to good quality planting material for timely&#13;
planting; (g) training women in in-situ budding (if appropriate) or facilitating access to services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-133-&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
of trained technicians at the correct time; (h) visiting women's activities at key times to review&#13;
progress of their crops and provide technical guidance, e.g., at time of pruning, spraying, pest&#13;
control, post harvest handling at the farm level; and (i) organizing group action for marketing.&#13;
24.         Land Development. The Soil Conservation Department (or other designated&#13;
provider of services) would be responsible for: (a) surveying women's land and drawing up plan of&#13;
treatments required in collaboration with the owners; (b) participatory budgeting exercises ; (c)&#13;
training resource persons in the use of A-frames for laying contour key-lines; for the purpose of&#13;
construction of contour bunds, graded bunds, contour vegetative hedges, etc.; (d) guiding women in&#13;
the establishment of nursery for vegetative material; and (e) regularly supervising the progress of&#13;
work undertaken by the women;&#13;
25.         Irrigation. The Irrigation Department (or other designated provided of services)&#13;
would be responsible for: (a) surveying and determining appropriate location of well or other&#13;
irrigation system; (b) providing guidance on implementation of construction; (c) regularly&#13;
supervising the progress of work; and (d) providing advice on procurement of materials, pump, etc.&#13;
26.          Animal Husbandry. The Animal Husbandry Department (or other service&#13;
provider) would be responsible for: (a) advising women on appropriate livestock enterprises and&#13;
orienting them to the need to ensure access to adequate feed resources; (b) train women in livestock&#13;
management, health care, and feed regimes; (c) train some members of the SHGs as para-vets; and&#13;
(d) provide regular animal health care services to women.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
SUPPORT FOR NON-FARM INCOME GENERATING ACTIVITIES&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
1.          The objective of this component of the project is to raise the level of women's&#13;
involvement in non-farm activities from subsistence to more profitable levels; facilitate new&#13;
entrants in starting income generation activities; and facilitate skill and capacity building including&#13;
the development of abilities in decision making and management of resources. Women will have&#13;
different priorities in taking up non-farm activities ranging from those viewing an income&#13;
generating activity as a supplementary source of income to those with the ability to establish a more&#13;
complex micro-enterprise activity as a full time occupation and primary source of income, requiring&#13;
a higher level of business skills. Assistance provided under the project would need to&#13;
accommodate these diverse needs.&#13;
B. Constraints&#13;
2.          Past efforts to promote non-farm activities have frequently failed as the selection of&#13;
activities has been production, rather than market-driven, and training has frequently been provided&#13;
in isolation from linkages with finance, production technology and market opportunities. Other&#13;
constraints experienced include the difficulty of identifying financially viable activities; inadequate&#13;
processes for training potential entrepreneurs particularly from amongst poor women; confusion of&#13;
welfare and business objectives on the part of facilitators; lack of regular support to entrepreneurs&#13;
after the initial launch of the activity and weaknesses in technology transfer, product development&#13;
and marketing. Particular factors constraining the promotion of non-farm activities amongst poor&#13;
women include:&#13;
(a)   Women have problems in getting access to credit due to lack of ownership of land&#13;
and property that can be used as collateral. Timely availability and adequacy of&#13;
finance are critical.&#13;
(b)   Low levels of literacy.&#13;
(c)   Lack of knowledge with regard to bookkeeping and accounts.&#13;
(d)   Rigid mind sets, paternalistic behavior and lack of gender sensitivity of the line&#13;
agencies. Hence the need to sensitize them to gender and poverty issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-136-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
(e)   Lack of familiarity with the external environment beyond the village thereby&#13;
limiting mobility.&#13;
(f)    Lack of confidence in dealing with officials in the districts and in sector-based&#13;
corporations resulting in poor access to existing infrastructure.&#13;
(g)   Most of the women in the target group are at or below subsistence level. There is no&#13;
room for making incorrect choices as the costs of failure are very high. Hence the&#13;
importance of appropriate guidance from the initial stages of the program.&#13;
(h)   In cases where the raw material is provided to groups of women and the product is&#13;
marketed by an intervening agency, the women are far from empowered:&#13;
(i)    The women remain at the level of wage Labour and perhaps graduate to&#13;
piece rate work.&#13;
(ii)   Payment levels are extremely low and there is a sense of exploitation as well&#13;
as dependency.&#13;
(iii)  The agency may not have marketing know-how and the women are blamed&#13;
for inventory pile-up.&#13;
(iv)   There is no link between the women and the customer so no feed back for&#13;
the women producers regarding quality/market need.&#13;
(v)   Complete dependency of the women's groups on the agency.&#13;
Hence the importance of providing entrepreneurship training and skills to the self-&#13;
help groups.&#13;
(i)    NGOs may not have skills in identifying appropriate activities for income&#13;
generation. Hence the need to provide this orientation as well as involve&#13;
organizations/individuals with entrepreneurship skills as resource agencies for&#13;
business identification, market surveys, skill provision, follow-up and back-up&#13;
trouble shooting.&#13;
(j)   If credit is taken for developing new skills or activities without ensuring adequate&#13;
market demand the risk is high.&#13;
C. Approach&#13;
3.           To counteract these weaknesses, the approach adopted under the project emphasizes&#13;
the identification of potentially profitable activities in a specific location based on raw materials,&#13;
existing skills and market opportunities specific to that location. Non-farm activities would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-137-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
selected by the women, based on individual choice. Production could be at the individual or group&#13;
level. Selection would be from a wide range of production, trading and service activities. The&#13;
project would expose the women to a range of market determined traditional and non-traditional&#13;
income generating activities through participatory action around a menu of options of feasible&#13;
economic activities.&#13;
4.           Experience indicates that it is easier to build on existing skills and familiar&#13;
products than to introduce new products/activities and develop new skills. Similarly, it is easier&#13;
for the target group to market their goods locally than seek marketing opportunities in distant&#13;
urban markets. Hence, the identification process should follow a sequential approach, starting&#13;
with examining the scope for the easiest activities/products to be promoted, based on existing&#13;
skills and local resources and markets, before moving towards the more difficult areas of the&#13;
introduction of new products and new skills. Such an approach would suggest the following&#13;
hierarchy of activities for analysis: (a) expansion of traditional activities in the project area&#13;
which offer growth prospects; (b) identification of existing products for which there is a&#13;
deficiency of supply in local markets; and (c) identification of new products in fast growing&#13;
sectors so that production from the project area is fulfilling incremental demand rather than&#13;
competing with existing producers who have a head start.&#13;
5.           The activities in which rural women are typically engaged can be divided into six&#13;
broad groups of activities.&#13;
(a)    Trading activities such as vending vegetables, fish, milk, and fruits, breaking bulk&#13;
and grading or sorting.&#13;
(b)    Activities based on traditional skills and using local raw materials such as leaf plate&#13;
making, brooms, embroidery, bead work, making ropes, mats, bamboo products,&#13;
laces, pandal making, durrie weaving, fabric weaving, pottery, etc.&#13;
(c)    Production and trade in processed foods such as parboiled rice, jams, jellies, fruit&#13;
bars, papads, honey, bread, biscuits, snacks, tamarind powder, spices, salt, etc.&#13;
(d)   Non-traditional activities such as making cards, notebooks, files, envelopes and&#13;
raising broiler chickens.&#13;
(e)    Traditional service activities such as running small hotels, provision stores and tea&#13;
stalls or hiring out bicycles or utensils.&#13;
(f)    Skill-based non-traditional service activities such as hand pump repair, radio repair,&#13;
running STD booths, cycle repair, photography, plumbing, welding, zip repair, etc.&#13;
6.           Substantial improvement in the returns from any of these activities is possible with&#13;
marginal interventions. For instance, women in trading activities such as vegetable vending could&#13;
benefit substantially from access to timely and adequate credit on commercial terms. Credit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-138-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
available from the SHG at even 24 percent would represent a significant benefit given that the local&#13;
moneylender charges as much as 120 percent. Similarly linkages could be established with larger&#13;
markets thereby enabling higher net returns. Access to credit for purchase of a bicycle or push cart&#13;
would reduce the drudgery of carrying head loads to the market and increase the number of villages&#13;
covered.&#13;
7.           Similarly women using traditional skills in embroidery, leaf plate making, durrie&#13;
weaving, pottery, etc., could benefit from interventions pertaining to design and color&#13;
combinations, thread quality, technology and tools and marketing as also from the availability of&#13;
cheaper credit than moneylenders. FoodprQ.oceing activities would benefit from interventions&#13;
that improve marketability through quality control, brand name, licenses, measuring and testing&#13;
instruments and a clean production environment or common production facility center. Services&#13;
such as hand pump repair, cycle repair, plumbing, etc., would need skill development training and,&#13;
subsequently, on the job apprenticeships followed by credit to enable purchase of the necessary&#13;
tools and possibly work spaces.&#13;
8.           Financial models have been prepared for nine representative activities. If the credit&#13;
intervention is for existing non-farm activities the initial returns are high. If the credit intervention&#13;
is for a new activity without determining marketing conditions and linkages, the risk is high.&#13;
Income levels for women in non-farm activities vary from as low as Rs. 15 per day to as high as Rs.&#13;
75 or more per day depending on the activity and the area under consideration.&#13;
D. Project Interventions&#13;
9.           Project interventions to support non-farm activities would comprise the following&#13;
sequential steps:&#13;
(a) Development and Operationalisation of Strategy for Support to Non-Farm&#13;
Activities&#13;
* Given the weakness of the support structure for non-farm activities in most states, the&#13;
project would contract agencies with recognized expertise in entrepreneurship and&#13;
business development to develop the overall strategy for support to non-farm activities,&#13;
identify local agencies/individuals capable of providing the necessary support and&#13;
develop their capacity to transfer business, technical and marketing skills to SHGs.&#13;
This input would comprise:&#13;
(i)    Organization of a visioning-cum-planning workshop at the state level to&#13;
develop the overall strategy and approach for the promotion of non-farm&#13;
activities under the project. Participants in this brainstorming exercise&#13;
would be the WDC, partner NGOs and agencies within the state with&#13;
experience in non-farm activities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-139-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
(ii)  Identification of resource agencies/NGOs/individuals capable of providing&#13;
support in the various aspects required, e.g., entrepreneurship development.&#13;
In addition to identifying state level resources, this exercise would be carried&#13;
out for each project district. This would also include orientation to project&#13;
implementors at the district level to the overall strategy and approach to the&#13;
promotion of non-farm activities under the project.&#13;
(iii)  Entrepreneurship sensitization for NGOs (see below) and other support&#13;
agencies through organization of a 4-day workshop for NGOs and 2-day&#13;
workshop for other support agencies. The objective of the workshops would&#13;
be to sensitize and develop an understanding among the NGOs about&#13;
entrepreneurship and the support they would need to provide to the groups&#13;
or individual women in the process of setting up any economic activity.&#13;
(iv)  Identification of resource agencies to provide vocational skills training in&#13;
key areas (as indicated by the techno-economic studies) and interaction with&#13;
EDP agencies to tailor entrepreneurship development training programs to&#13;
match local needs;&#13;
(v)   Identification of best practitioners, i.e., successful entrepreneurs in relevant&#13;
income generating activities in the project districts willing to provide back-&#13;
up support to women producers and networking them with the NGOs and&#13;
SHGs.&#13;
(vi)   Conduct of model EDP in each district for the trainers of the identified EDP&#13;
training agencies, NGOs, other local resource persons and representative&#13;
women producers from the SHGs. The objective would be to orient and&#13;
guide the trainers in the implementation of EDPs geared to the specific&#13;
needs of mainly illiterate women.&#13;
(vii)  Follow-up, including review of the performance of strategy implementation,&#13;
development and operationalization of mechanisms for scaling up income&#13;
generating activities when they plateau and provision of back-stopping&#13;
support to resolve particular problems, both at the macro-level and in&#13;
relation to specific women producers.&#13;
* The WDCs would have the option of contracting agencies with recognized expertise&#13;
within the state to provide these services or contracting experienced national agencies.&#13;
Two national level agencies with the appropriate expertise whose resources could be&#13;
used are the Asian Center for Entrepreneurial Initiatives (ACE) based in Bangalore and&#13;
the International Center for Entrepreneurship and Career Development (ICECD) based&#13;
in Ahmedabad. Terms of Reference are given in Attachment 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-140-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
(b) Techno-economic surveys&#13;
*  Techno-economic surveys would be conducted at the village level for each of the&#13;
districts identified for the project. These surveys would start with the identification of&#13;
existing local skills and resources and determine their marketability. The surveys would&#13;
also grade the locally available skills, identify methods to upgrade them and determine&#13;
the interventions necessary to make them marketable in traditional and non-traditional&#13;
markets.&#13;
*  In addition, the surveys would provide information on the population of the village, the&#13;
age profile, gender classification, literacy and numeracy levels, existing skills,&#13;
occupational distribution, income levels, non-farm activities, turover levels, major raw&#13;
materials used, raw materials available, land-use pattern, natural resources available,&#13;
consumption pattern, availability of electricity and other amenities, commercial and&#13;
educational infrastructure, markets in and around the village, frequency of haats,&#13;
existence of road and rail networks, type and frequency of transport facilities, etc.&#13;
Terms of Reference are given in Attachment 1.&#13;
(c) Market Surveys&#13;
* Market surveys would be undertaken for the products identified by the techno-economic&#13;
surveys on the basis of the availability of skills and local resources. These surveys&#13;
would focus on analyzing market demand, identifying marketing channels and outlets,&#13;
developing a marketing strategy, identifying market segments, positioning the product&#13;
in the market and pricing it appropriately. The surveys would encompass the whole&#13;
range of potential market outlets appropriate to the concerned products which may&#13;
include departmental stores in cities, government run emporia and corporations, retail&#13;
outlets, petty traders, occasional fairs and exhibitions. Particular attention would be&#13;
given to local haats which provide a low cost and regular means of marketing products&#13;
in rural areas. Consideration would be given to interventions that can help women&#13;
access haats and reduce the drudgery of getting and trading there. These could include&#13;
provision of bus services to and from haats held in nearby villages and towns,&#13;
construction of cement platforms and thatched roofs or tarpaulin shelters to reduce the&#13;
impact of rain and sun and spoilage of produce, construction of public toilets and&#13;
construction of godowns for safe storage of unsold stocks. Terms of Reference for&#13;
market surveys are given in Attachment 1.&#13;
(d) Feasibility Studies for Specific Products/Activities&#13;
* Where necessary, specialist agencies would be contracted to undertake more detailed&#13;
feasibility studies for specific products/activities. This is likely to apply to products&#13;
which are widely adopted by women, those whose viability may be marginal and new&#13;
products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-141-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
(e) Menu of Options&#13;
* Based on the techno-economic and market surveys, the menu of options of feasibility&#13;
activities for each locality would be drawn up. Activities would be divided into&#13;
permanent, seasonal, short duration, etc. to assist women in choosing activities to meet&#13;
their needs. Menu cards for the activities would be prepared giving information on&#13;
investment, skills required, minimum scale of operation, aptitude required,&#13;
minimum/maximum number of days operation per year, net surplus, and return per&#13;
manday. The menu of options and menu cards would be central to the participatory&#13;
process of selection of income generating activities by the women.&#13;
(f) Entrepreneurship and skill development&#13;
* Once women have selected their activity, their requirement for skill development and&#13;
entrepreneurship training would be assessed. While standard Entrepreneurship&#13;
Development Programs (EDPs) are conducted by several agencies, work with&#13;
grassroots groups needs the design and development of specific training programs in&#13;
opportunity sensing, business feasibility and business management skills for the key&#13;
persons in the groups. Such a program will help the women identify suitable product&#13;
choices and help them set up and run the business activity satisfactorily. The&#13;
complexity of the entrepreneurship training required will vary with the nature of the&#13;
activity taken up. Many women, who are essentially up-grading existing activities,&#13;
would only require a 3-5 day course covering basic business concepts, accounts, product&#13;
costing and calculation of margins, and marketing strategies including practical&#13;
exercises to study the local market demand and marketing channels for their products.&#13;
Others taking up a more complex micro-enterprise would require a more intensive&#13;
training of around 3-4 weeks duration including, in addition to a more detailed study of&#13;
the above subjects, awareness of registration processes and regulations affecting the&#13;
running of a business. During these entrepreneurship development programs, the&#13;
trainees would be required to conduct market studies for their proposed activities to&#13;
assess the size of their markets and the possible channels for marketing their products.&#13;
In the initial stages until the women are able to travel to nearby towns independently,&#13;
groups of women should be accompanied by the NGO or other support agency staff to&#13;
conduct market studies and talk to wholesalers/retail traders and institutional buyers to&#13;
see what the possible channels are for marketing a given product. The project would&#13;
finance inputs from recognized specialists (see para --) to assist the EDP trainers in the&#13;
state to tailor EDP programs to the needs of the women. Skill development training&#13;
would be provided through participation in existing courses or by engaging&#13;
trainers/mastercraftsmen to train the women in the village.&#13;
(g) Systems for trouble-shooting, hand-holding and follow-up&#13;
* The majority of business failures occur within the first year. In order to reduce the&#13;
number of casualties the project would identify successful entrepreneurs in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-142-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
identified field to hand-hold the new entrant through initial problems for a year or more&#13;
based on need. These links with best practitioners who can act as mentors and&#13;
counselors would provide for business guidance, problem solving, and monitoring of&#13;
accounts and the overall progress of the business. Their inputs would be supplemented&#13;
by the support systems provided to the groups by the NGOs backed by back-up trouble-&#13;
shooting by the nodal entrepreneurship agencies (see paras --). Such interventions&#13;
would reduce the chances of micro-enterprise failure by providing opportunities for&#13;
close monitoring and immediate corrective action in the case of problems.&#13;
*  The system of linking new entrants with successful entrepreneurs in that specific&#13;
activity for purposes of support, hand-holding and follow-up through the initial years of&#13;
understanding the business, has yielded excellent results as shown by the success of&#13;
AWAKE. Identification of a network of best practitioners in the relevant areas and&#13;
networking them with the NGOs and SHGs will be sustainable in the long run if the&#13;
relationship is symbiotic, i.e., the grassroots activities can be commercially linked with&#13;
the best practitioners. This could provide the SHGs with market access while the best&#13;
practitioners can use the linkages for sourcing some of their requirements. Care would&#13;
be needed to ensure that no exploitation of the grassroots groups takes place.&#13;
(h) Design and Technology Upgradation&#13;
D For several groups of products made by the rural poor, market need-based design&#13;
interventions could make a substantial difference by allowing access to the upper end of&#13;
the mnarket, reducing the risk of inventory pile-up and increasing the returns to the&#13;
artisan. An indicative list would include groups of products such as forest fibers, leaves,&#13;
bamboo, lac, coir, wood, mirror work, embroidery, durrie weaving, fabric, linen,&#13;
pottery, terracotta and metal. This intervention would also address issues pertaining to&#13;
quality control and standardization to reduce rejection rates and promote marketability.&#13;
The project would provide for the hiring of design institutes or freelance designers to&#13;
modify existing designs in the light of market needs, train artisans at the upper end of&#13;
the skills scale as mastercraftspersons or trainers to standardize production techniques,&#13;
upgrade skills, and ensure quality control so as to minimize losses due to rejection and&#13;
maximize returns to the artisan by reaching larger markets. A similar approach would&#13;
be taken to improving production technology through hiring specialist&#13;
agencies/individuals dealing with specific products to provide advice and guidance to&#13;
women producers. Terms of Reference are given in Attachment 1.&#13;
(i) Market Linkage Assistance&#13;
* Before starting a new business or increasing the scale of an on-going activity, action&#13;
must be taken to determine the market outlet and the means of accessing the market. As&#13;
part of the EDP, women would be required to conduct market studies and identify the&#13;
marketing channels for their selected product. Where necessary, the project would&#13;
contract marketing agents to provide advice on marketing strategies and assist with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-143-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
establishing market linkages for the women producers. These could include the&#13;
possibilities of linking up with existing private sector outlets; government emporia;&#13;
retail outlets, particularly for handicrafts, run by NGOs (e.g., Dastkar and Self-&#13;
Employed Women's Association); or participation in exhibitions and fairs held in&#13;
villages, towns and cities. Linkages with institutional buyers such as schools, factories,&#13;
restaurants and hotels near a village or with existing industrial units would also be&#13;
investigated.&#13;
* While there are a large number of government marketing and technical support agencies&#13;
at the district, state and national levels, systems must be evolved and linkages&#13;
established if the women's groups are to take advantage of them. Since it is virtually&#13;
impossible for poor rural women to individually access these organizations, structures&#13;
will have to be built that can link the women with existing government infrastructure.&#13;
One means of doing this would be for women in a cluster of SHGs involved in the same&#13;
activity to form a producer group/association.&#13;
(j) Communications and the Media&#13;
* A communications component would be an integral part of the program and would&#13;
focus on promoting exposure to alternate income generating activities and access to&#13;
information. Starting up and sustaining an economic activity is a complex process and&#13;
video films would be used to demonstrate the steps in setting up a business and&#13;
managing it. In addition, role models can provide inspiration, motivation and an&#13;
opportunity for learning. Video films documenting such cases could be a very powerful&#13;
way of reaching large numbers of existing and potential women producers. Existing&#13;
videos on these subjects prepared by such agencies as the National Institute of&#13;
Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development (NIESBUD) and NGOs such as,&#13;
Participatory Research for Asia (PRIA), would be screened for their suitability for use&#13;
under the project. If necessary, the CPSU would commission the production of these&#13;
videos which could then be used, with dubbing into local languages, by all the&#13;
participating states. Manuals would be prepared to go with each film. Booklets and&#13;
pamphlets, audio cassettes and radio programs relating to different microenterprises&#13;
would also be prepared. Again, the suitability of existing material would be assessed&#13;
before states commission the preparation of new material.&#13;
10.         Two options with regard to the video films are:&#13;
(a)   Preparation of a general 30 minute awareness raising film on income generation.&#13;
(b)   Preparation of a detailed training package in four parts of 30 minutes duration each.&#13;
Terms of Reference are given in Attachment 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-144-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
(c)   An overview of business and the use of case studies to highlight the impact of any&#13;
business on creating wealth, employment, value addition to the community, income&#13;
to the family and economic upliftment of the entrepreneur.&#13;
(d)   The role of the entrepreneur in the success of the business, selection of the business&#13;
and the chazacteristics and strengths needed to set up a business.&#13;
(e)   Understanding the business environment, opportunity sensing, rapid market&#13;
appraisal, formalities, sourcing technology, technical skills, finance, viability of the&#13;
business and sources of support from government and non-government agencies.&#13;
(d)   Coping with start-up, sustaining the business, avoiding pitfalls and sickness,&#13;
managing money, group dynamics, record keeping and planning for growth.&#13;
(e)   Terms of Reference for the four part film are given in Attachment I.&#13;
E. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
11.         Implementation of the interventions and support services required for successful&#13;
promotion of income generating activities, will require contracts with specialist agencies with&#13;
proven skills in the given area. Such contracts will be necessary for conducting techno-economic&#13;
surveys; for market intelligence, conducting market surveys and establishing market linkages;&#13;
provision of business and technical skills to the SHGs and development of entrepreneurship&#13;
programs tailored to local needs; sensitization of NGOs with regard to entrepreneurship, setting up&#13;
systems for trouble-shooting, hand-holding and follow-up; upgrading of design skills and&#13;
development of video films and other materials for publicizing role models and for training. The&#13;
proposed interventions and implementation arrangements are summarized in the matrix in&#13;
Attachment 2.&#13;
12.         The Business Development Officer in the WDC district unit would be primarily&#13;
responsible for coordinating the provision of support services to women producers. The WDC&#13;
Marketing Officer at the state level would provide the necessary contacts with marketing agents&#13;
specialized in various products. The WDC Training Coordinator would be involved in liaising with&#13;
the training resource agencies identified by the nodal entrepreneurship development agencies.&#13;
Role of NGOs&#13;
13.         Given their close contacts with the SHG members, the NGOs sponsoring the SHGs&#13;
would be expected to play a key role in promoting non-farm activities. They would assist the&#13;
women in the selection of appropriate income generating activities from the menu of options, help&#13;
the women overcome constraints such as lack of literacy, problems in mobility, and lack of&#13;
confidence in dealing with officials and coordinate the provision of the necessary support services&#13;
through accessing the support networks set up by the nodal entrepreneurship development&#13;
organizations. The successful implementation of this program requires the orientation of the NGOs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-145-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
towards issues pertaining to entrepreneurship and the support needed by SHG members setting up&#13;
income generating activities. However, most NGOs are very weak in this area. Hence the NGOs&#13;
sponsoring the SHGs would be given intensive training in business development by the nodal&#13;
entrepreneurship development organization so that they are able to effectively assist the women in&#13;
the establishment of their businesses. The NGOs would also be assisted to network with the locally&#13;
identified resource agencies/individuals to facilitate ready access to additional support.&#13;
Potential Support Agencies&#13;
14.         The depth and quality of resources which the WDC can draw on to support the&#13;
promotion of non-farm activities varies between the participating states. This highlights the&#13;
importance of networking between the states to identify outside resources where necessary. Local&#13;
training organizations or resource partners could include organizations such as any of the Rural&#13;
Development and Self-Employment Training Institutes (RUDSETI) centers or Rural Technology&#13;
Institute at Gandhinagar, Gujarat or the Canara Bank Platinum Jubilee Rural Development Trust,&#13;
Bangalore, or Central Food Technology Research Institute. In addition, there are several&#13;
cooperatives and NGOs in the country that have developed skills in building group-based&#13;
entrepreneurial skills, e.g., Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA), the Lijjat groups, and&#13;
PRADAN. With the passage of time, mature groups can be used to develop capacity where&#13;
possible so that the groups can work towards a sense of owning and managing the program.&#13;
15.         Other institutions supporting micro enterprise development include the state level&#13;
technical consultancy organizations such as TECSOK, GITCO, MPCON, BITCON, UPCON and&#13;
HARDICON which could prepare techno-economic feasibility reports, conduct market surveys,&#13;
identify investment opportunities and help implement projects. Marketing organizations such as&#13;
Development Commissioner of Handicrafts, Development Commissioner of Handlooms,&#13;
Handicrafts and Handloom Export Corporation, Central Cottage Industries, State Emporia for&#13;
handicrafts and handlooms, export promotion councils, and organizations specializing in marketing&#13;
products produced in rural areas, such as GRIMCO in Gujarat have massive infrastructure that can&#13;
be utilized for marketing some of the products produced by the SHGs as also for determining&#13;
market trends, conducting market surveys, and accessing new designs. Other institutions would&#13;
include the district industry Centres, Khadi and Village Industries Commission, Khadi and Village&#13;
Industries Board, Council for Advancement of People's Action and Rural Technology (CAPART),&#13;
and specialist marketing boards for various products such as for silk, coir, etc. However, the track&#13;
record of several of these organizations in terms of providing access to poor rural women is dismal&#13;
and the project would need to explore mechanisms for improving the access of poor women if the&#13;
women's groups are to take advantage of the technical and marketing support that they can provide.&#13;
16.         Several organizations conduct vocational and entrepreneurship related training for&#13;
different products. These include CFTRI, Mysore, CLRI, Madras, organizations like Centre for&#13;
Entrepreneurship Development at Chandigarh, Dharwar, Madurai and Ahmedabad, CEDOK,&#13;
Dharwar, Rural Technology Institute, Gujarat, AWAKE, Bangalore, ACE, Bangalore, EDI,&#13;
Ahmedabad, ICECD, Ahmedabad, NIESBUD, Delhi, NISIET, Rural Development and Self&#13;
Employment Training Institutes (RUDSETI) at 11 centers in the country, Canara Bank Platinum&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-146-&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Jubilee Rural Development Trust, Bangalore and Bharat Yuvak Shakti Trust, CII, Delhi among&#13;
others. Many of these organizations have resources and infrastructure that can be valuable in&#13;
implementing the project. For instance, CFTRI has played a major role in developing and&#13;
disseminating technology pertaining to food processing and development of balanced meals for&#13;
school children. In addition there are several agricultural universities and institutes with a wealth of&#13;
knowledge that can be drawn on for agro-related income generating activities.&#13;
&#13;

RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT&#13;
I. STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION&#13;
I .    The project has been prepared with the extensive participation of a range of stakeholders,&#13;
and finalised after intensive consultations with them during pre-appraisal and appraisal. The&#13;
participants include:&#13;
&#149;  potential women beneficiaries, women's groups, panchayat members and other&#13;
village leaders, government workers and officials at the vilage, block and district&#13;
levels, with whom the key implementing agencies, such as the Women's Development&#13;
Corporations, state nodal departments, NGOs collaborating in preparation of the project,&#13;
and IFAD and joint Bank-IFAD missions have discussed needs and problems faced in&#13;
key project areas;&#13;
*  intermediary field, resource and networking NGOs; officials from government line&#13;
departments in district administrations and at state level, such as the agriculture,&#13;
animal husbandry, forestry, rural development, education, health, and ICDS&#13;
departments, who have participated in discussions, field visits, meetings and workshops&#13;
and provided information and views which have influenced the development of project&#13;
objectives, scope and activities;&#13;
* "apex" resource institutions (e.g., Friends of Women's World Banking, the Bankers'&#13;
Institute of Rural Development in Lucknow, the Indiar. Institutes of Management at&#13;
Ahmedabad and Bangalore), banks and NABARD, and state government agencies&#13;
(such as the U.P. Land Development Corporation and Haryana's Mewat Development&#13;
Agency), who have discussed important project support activities, including training,&#13;
banking mechanisms, enterprise development, social components, and monitoring;&#13;
* state nodal departments (Departments of Women and Child Development/Social&#13;
*  Welfare/Industries) and Women's Development Corporations, and the Government&#13;
of India's Department of Women and Child Development, who have led and&#13;
managed the project preparation process and participated fully in discussions, visits and&#13;
workshops, with IFAD and joint IFAD-Bank missions; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-156-&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
* multilateral and bilateral agencies, including the United Nations Development&#13;
Programme (UNDP), UNICEF, GTZ (the German government technical cooperation&#13;
agency), the British Council, CARE International. Several of these agencies support&#13;
projects or activities relevant to the objectives and scope of this project, and have&#13;
indicated interest in collaborating with IDA, or in financing activities in parallel with&#13;
the project to support it during implementation. A workshop organized during Appraisal&#13;
by MYRADA, a collaborating NGO, to discuss the project with representatives of&#13;
different stakeholders was financed by PLAN International.&#13;
II. SOCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
2.    Participatory approaches are central to (a) the identification of the project's target group; (b)&#13;
the micro-level planning envisaged in the project, particularly for enterprise development and the&#13;
social components, which will involve eliciting views and preferred development options; and (c)&#13;
overall implementation of the project. In effect, the project concept and approach are themselves&#13;
a continuous process of social assessment which will occur throughout implementation, as they&#13;
are highly participatory and demand driven. For example:&#13;
-  Implementing NGOs will be selected by the WDCs in consultation with village women,&#13;
other residents and leaders, and district officials, thus ensuring that they are acceptable&#13;
to all.&#13;
*  The selection of "target beneficiaries" by the NGOs involved in group formation would&#13;
involve social assessment processes. The NGOs will know the villages in which they&#13;
work and engage their communities in identifying target households. While nurturing&#13;
the SHGs, the NGOs will consult with communities widely about what problems the&#13;
community/women have experienced which need to be addressed during&#13;
implementation, what program/infrastructure linkages need to be strengthened in the&#13;
particular village, what micro-enterprises are acceptable to the women, and so on.&#13;
During these processes, the NGOs will also become aware of the need for and&#13;
appropriate strategies to implement aspects of the program such as gender sensitization,&#13;
awareness creation, etc.&#13;
*  The group formation and maturing process itself entails a constant sharing of&#13;
experiences, analysis of needs, strategies, and outcomes by group members and&#13;
implementing agencies.&#13;
*  The SHGs would be involved in a number of activities which ensure that their views as&#13;
well as those of their village communities are taken into account during project&#13;
implementation. These include participatory training activities, community&#13;
consultations for the purposes of determining what community assets need to be&#13;
created, and self-assessment techniques used during monitoring and evaluation to assess&#13;
the performance and impact of the project and promote sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-157-&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
3.          Therefore, while no fonnal social assessment "study" has taken place, other than the&#13;
assessments described in Annex 15 for tribal populations, project preparation and appraisal&#13;
processes identified the wide range of stakeholders described above, obtained their views, and&#13;
carried out social analysis. A number of significant issues which were identified have been taken&#13;
into account in project design. For example:&#13;
*  Concern was expressed that the project should not focus only on women below the&#13;
poverty line. Haryana, for example, is a state with a relatively high per capita income&#13;
and a low percentage of people below the poverty line, and it is clear that even women&#13;
above the poverty line are severely disadvantaged socially. Alternative approaches&#13;
were discussed widely. Consequently, the project proposes to concentrate economic&#13;
activities on the poor, but has developed small sub-components (such as awareness&#13;
creation) which will reach out to other disadvantaged women and address their needs.&#13;
*  In some areas, the friction between panchayats and field NGOs creates the risk of a&#13;
powerful force of "negative stakeholders". It was agreed that in order to reduce such&#13;
potential tension during project implementation, the WDCs would ensure that the&#13;
implementing NGOs have the full support of local self-government groups as well as of&#13;
potential beneficiaries. This would be done through a village level consultation process.&#13;
In addition, panchayats and other community members would be oriented fully to the&#13;
project concept and its approaches. Further, conflict resolution will be an important&#13;
aspect of the training imparted to the NGOs, SHGs, etc.&#13;
Another potential group of negative stakeholders are me in the communities, who may resent the&#13;
project for its empowering effects on women. A consequence of this resentment is often increased&#13;
domestic or community violence against women. The project plans to include gender sensitization&#13;
as a community activity, and will increase women's awareness of their rights. In addition, the&#13;
solidarity achieved among women through group formation and action would assist women in&#13;
dealing with this problem individually and collectively.&#13;
III. MACRO-INDICATORS OF SOCIAL STATUS IN THE PROJECT DISTRICTS&#13;
4.           The project will be implemented in selected districts of six states, numbering 35 in&#13;
all. The districts have been chosen, firstly, on the basis of poverty criteria, viz. the percentage of&#13;
population below the poverty line (BPL), sex ratio, female literacy rate, and percentage of&#13;
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST) in the population. The main reason for use of&#13;
poverty criteria is that the project aims to improve the economic and social situation of poor women&#13;
in areas where their opportunities have thus far been limited. In some states, such as Bihar and&#13;
Madhya Pradesh, the selected districts represent substantially different geo-cultural zones. A&#13;
reason for such representation is that, in time, expansion of the project to a much larger program&#13;
would be facilitated if success can be shown to have been achieved in a variety of settings. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-158-&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
addition, district selection has also taken into account the availability of NGOs to implement the&#13;
project.&#13;
5.           The states and districts selected represent a range of different social situations.&#13;
Female literacy levels in the districts range from 7 percent in Tikamgarh, M.P., to 50 percent in&#13;
Bharuch, Gujarat. The districts' sex ratios, representing the overall survival of females relative to&#13;
males, vary from 818 to 1007. The poor comprise a high proportion of the population in Bharuch&#13;
and Panchmahals, Gujarat, and in Betul, M.P., as represented by the percentage of the population&#13;
who are SC/ST, but are as low as 12 percent in Surendranagar, Gujarat. Although these macro-&#13;
indicators are not likely to be significantly impacted by the project during its five-year duration,&#13;
because the coverage of each district by the project will be limited, they are, nevertheless, important&#13;
indicators of the status of women in the project areas.&#13;
6.           The key target group for the project is women below the poverty line, defined by the&#13;
Government of India as an income of Rs. 11,000 per household (consisting of an average of 5.5&#13;
persons) in rural areas. Most women in this category are likely to be from landless households, or&#13;
small or marginal farm households. Emphasis will be placed on including women who are heads of&#13;
households, who are among the most severely disadvantaged. Many of these poor women face a&#13;
multiplicity of adverse circumstances: not only are their economic situations strained, but they are&#13;
also faced with eking out livings under constraints of infrastructure (in part on account of the areas&#13;
in which they live), low access to technologies for work or drudgery-reduction, poor access to&#13;
social services, and heavy family responsibilities.&#13;
IV. KEY SOCIAL ISSUES AND RELATED PROJECT ACTIONS&#13;
7.           A number of issues which are related to the project's objectives, concept and&#13;
approach are raised by the social indicators in the project areas. These are discussed below, along&#13;
with descriptions of how the project addresses them.&#13;
A.    Literacy&#13;
8.          In most of the project districts, female literacy is lower than the national average and&#13;
the average of the state in which the district lies. This is to be expected since the districts were&#13;
chosen on the basis of poverty criteria, and female literacy is generally well correlated with poverty.&#13;
Similarly, at the level of blocks and villages selected for implementation, female literacy is low,&#13;
and there are likely to be very few literate women in the majority of Self Help Groups which are&#13;
formed.&#13;
9.           Experience elsewhere in the country (e.g., in the IFAD-supported project in&#13;
Dharmapuri, Tamil Nadu, as well as in projects implemented by a number of NGOs, some of which&#13;
will be involved in this project) has shown that low (or virtually no) literacy among group members&#13;
is a severe constraint to the development of group activities. In particular, group members find it&#13;
difficult to keep accounts, to access services which require the filling of forms including bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-159-&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
services, or even to monitor their savings. As a result they become dependent on the individual&#13;
who maintains their books and accounts. Consequently it was felt that providing group members&#13;
basic "functional" literacy is critical to the success of the project, and hence should be a project&#13;
component. Acquisition of functional literacy skills by SHG members would facilitate the&#13;
working of the groups broadly, including the maintenance of accounts and records, enabling&#13;
women to take on leadership responsibilities, and facilitating access to information for both&#13;
economic and social development.&#13;
10.         Accordingly, the project has made provisions for the SHGs to acquire functional&#13;
literacy skills building on what has been achieved through other programs, harnessing resources&#13;
(personnel, material and financial) available under other schemes such as the total literacy/adult&#13;
literacy activities of government or even non-governmental agencies in the area, and supplementing&#13;
them where necessary to strengthen their focus on project-related literacy and numeracy skills. The&#13;
literacy teaching would be provided only when group members express a demand for it, and the&#13;
group is willing to bear the cost of sustaining the activity, if necessary, beyond the 18-month period&#13;
which is deemed a reasonable time for group members to acquire functional literacy. The groups&#13;
would plan and organize literacy classes in collaboration with the implementing NGO. A tutor&#13;
would be chosen from among group members or other community residents who have appropriate&#13;
qualifications. The project would provide for training/retraining of tutors before commencement of&#13;
classes, and for a nominal honorarium for them. Purchase of teacher and learner materials and&#13;
miscellaneous equipment would also be financed, as well as the costs incurred by the NGOs&#13;
managing the activity. Specialist NGOs may be engaged by WDCs to carry out the activity where&#13;
necessary.&#13;
11.         In areas where the Total Literacy Campaigns have been concluded successfully,&#13;
post-literacy activities could be supported, if necessary, or supplemented, if on-going. A special&#13;
need related specifically to the project's credit and micro-enterprise activities is the development of&#13;
teaching-learning materials for accounting and business purposes. Under the project, organizations&#13;
which have specialized capabilities in this field will be engaged to collate/develop and produce&#13;
materials in the local languages. Post-literacy materials would be suitably modified. By the end of&#13;
the project, it is expected that the SHGs formed would have sufficient literacy among their&#13;
members to function smoothly and to feel they have been empowered through its acquisition.&#13;
12.         In some states, such as Haryana, other special needs arise in the context of&#13;
functional literacy because of very adverse social conditions affecting women. Haryana is&#13;
particularly interested in creating awareness of the legal and familial rights of women on account of&#13;
widespread violence against them, as well as of underlying social problems such as alcohol abuse&#13;
and drug addiction. Consequently, the functional literacy component will encompass such&#13;
awareness creation.&#13;
B.    Access to Health Services&#13;
13.         The project districts are also characterised by poor health among their populations.&#13;
The poverty of these districts is synonymous with (a) greater susceptibility of their populations to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-160-&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
illness on account of the major common infections, including childhood infections; (b) poor health&#13;
among women, especially anemia, which reduces women's capacities to work and makes them&#13;
greatly susceptible to illness, maternal mortality, and pregnancy and infant loss; and (c)&#13;
underdevelopment of the public health care infrastructure, including a lack of facilities, staff and&#13;
supplies, as well as poor private health services. Access to health services is poor as the&#13;
government health system, which is structured to provide a facility for each cluster of 4-5 villages,&#13;
is often non-functional in many backward areas. Similarly, access to private health services is often&#13;
minimal as "modem" medical practitioners prefer to practise in towns or large, better-off villages.&#13;
Even traditional practitioners are increasingly becoming "urbanized", leaving poor rural&#13;
populations to the less trained.&#13;
14.         All these problems represent major constraints to the development of women's&#13;
economic status and the improvement of household well-being. Greater illness among household&#13;
members and children means that adult women spend more time caring for sick members of their&#13;
households. It also places a greater burden on both women and children to work, in order that&#13;
household income is assured in the event that the male head of household falls ill. Where illnesses&#13;
such as tuberculosis and malaria have debilitated adult male members of households, women are&#13;
often the effective heads of households, and face a heavy double burden. In addition, neglect of&#13;
their own health or illness, particularly if their households are dependent on their earnings, initiates&#13;
a further downward spiral - loss of wages, poor and worsening nutrition on account of household&#13;
poverty, greater debility and further diminished work capacity.&#13;
15.         It is well established that illness is a major cause of indebtedness (to moneylenders)&#13;
among poor families throughout the country. Women members of thrift and credit groups often&#13;
report that they borrow from group savings to pay the costs of health care. Health emergencies are&#13;
particularly devastating. Consumption loans, also, are often taken because the illness of a chief&#13;
wage eamer has reduced household income to the point where even basic food requirements cannot&#13;
be met.&#13;
16.         Several NGOs working with women's self help groups (e.g., SEWA and Utthan in&#13;
Gujarat, and Adithi in Bihar) have found that providing basic health care that is easily accessible to&#13;
women and low cost is effective in releasing poor households from the vicious cycle of low&#13;
economic status and ill-health. Where groups are spread out geographically, and health facilities&#13;
are distant, the most common approach has been to train village-level health workers to provide&#13;
basic preventive and curative health care and health education to women. In places where health&#13;
facilities and practitioners are relatively more accessible, and large numbers of women can be&#13;
organized (as SEWA has done in Gujarat), efforts encompass health insurance schemes and&#13;
maternity benefits.&#13;
17.         Taking this into consideration, the project has made provisions to assist women to&#13;
reduce the burden of ill-health in order that they can benefit fully from the economic activities.&#13;
Where women members of Self-Help Groups express basic health care as a priority need, and there&#13;
are gaps in the availability of basic public health services, the project provides for an appropriate&#13;
local NGO to train selected women volunteers in basic health care. It is anticipated that about 60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-161-&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
percent of SHGs would opt for a strategy to address the health of their communities. As the SHGs&#13;
grow in strength, their ability to lobby the health system for an improved village-level health care&#13;
would increase.&#13;
18.         The health volunteer would be a woman selected by the group in consultation with&#13;
the wider community. Once trained, she would (a) help to disseminate information on health&#13;
related issues and promote preventive health care; (b) help group members and other women in the&#13;
village to access the formal health system or private health facilities, with a focus on women and&#13;
child health; and (c) where necessary, provide simple basic health care, such as first aid or oral&#13;
rehydration salts. The project would also provide health education materials, a simple basic kit of&#13;
equipment and supplies to the trainee. The contents of the kit would be in keeping with practices&#13;
approved by the state Health Department for primary health care workers.&#13;
19.         A stepwise approach is envisaged with regard to the activities of the health worker.&#13;
After training, the focus of her work would initially be with the group. This would entail only a&#13;
part-time commitment and, in the context of mutual help within the group, it is envisaged that no&#13;
stipend would be necessary. As she gains in confidence and the value of her services is perceived&#13;
by the wider community, her efforts could extend to the community in response to their demand.&#13;
At this time, the health worker would work out a mechanism with the community for compensation&#13;
for her services and replenishment of her supplies. The project may however provide refresher&#13;
training for the health worker.&#13;
C.    Child Care for Working Mothers&#13;
20.         Given the already heavy workloads of women, several stakeholders expressed&#13;
concern that women would only be able to engage in additional income-generating activities if&#13;
some facilities were available for child care. Traditional child care arrangements have all but&#13;
broken down with the nuclearization of families, with greater responsibility devolving on older&#13;
siblings (particularly girls) to care for young ones. Although the government has instituted the&#13;
Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program widely, this provides only limited day care&#13;
to working mothers. In view of this, the project has made provisions for day care to be organized&#13;
under certain circumstances. For example, where women are working at some distance from their&#13;
homes, and have no family or community support network, they could organize themselves to&#13;
engage a child care worker.&#13;
21.         The approach calls for the SHG to first lobby for the extension of existing programs&#13;
(such as ICDS) to their village, or for the program to address their specific needs effectively, for&#13;
example, through better location of the ICDS center (anganwadi) or modification of its working&#13;
hours to fit with their work patterns. Where this is not achievable, the project provides for&#13;
established SHGs (at least one year old) to receive assistance towards the honorarium of a child&#13;
minder for a period of two years on a sliding scale: 90 percent in the first year and 60 percent in the&#13;
second year. Thereafter, the SHG would take responsibility for financing this service. In&#13;
establishing honoraria for the child minders, the SHGs would be encouraged to keep in mind the&#13;
scales and pattern of other schemes for day care centers/creches in the area. The project would also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-162-&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
provide some initial equipment. Once again, these provisions would be made available only to&#13;
SHGs which have expressed need and demand for it, and are contingent on the SHG being willing&#13;
to meet the costs of sustaining the activity after the two-year period.&#13;
D.   Assistance to Leverage Funds for Community Asset Creation&#13;
22.         The project would assist communities to leverage resources from on-going&#13;
programs to create community assets which improve the quality of women's daily lives by&#13;
reducing drudgery and the time taken by routine domestic chores. This would enhance women's&#13;
abilities to achieve higher economic levels. The extent of women's participation in economic&#13;
work and community activities, and the benefits accrued from these by women and their families, is&#13;
often affected by the degree of drudgery faced by women in tasks such as fetching water, collecting&#13;
or cutting fodder and fuelwood. The project provides a fixed monetary sum per "natural" village,&#13;
which may be spent on several items in small amounts or all together on a single major asset.&#13;
23.         The basic principles of this component are: (a) the project would facilitate&#13;
community access to those services and development activities that contribute to drudgery&#13;
reduction and hence to greater productivity, and which enhance the status of group members in the&#13;
eyes of their community; (b) the funds would be available only after a group has stabilized (e.g.,&#13;
after the second year of its existence), (c) the decision to acquire/create the asset would be taken by&#13;
the community as a whole, and the asset would be accessible to the wider community for use; (d)&#13;
the funds provided by the project would be used to promote convergence between activities&#13;
selected for support and on-going programs; (e) the relatively small amount of funds provided&#13;
would be used to leverage resources in cash or kindfrom other development schemes, as well as&#13;
community contributions; and (f) implementation would be with community participation.&#13;
24.         The following steps would be taken to utilize this assistance:&#13;
*  The SHG, assisted by the local implementing NGO, would seek the views of their&#13;
community to determine priorities.&#13;
*  With the help of the implementing NGO, the SHG would prepare a proposal for&#13;
submission to the state WIDC. Panchayats would play a key role in these two processes,&#13;
particularly where they have access to development funds for community asset creation.&#13;
Interactions between the women's groups and panchayats, including women panchayat&#13;
members, could help to improve the position of women in their communities by&#13;
enlarging the role they play in such community decision-making.&#13;
*  The proposals would be forwarded to the Women's Development Corporation for&#13;
review, approval and financing. Each proposal would identify the various sources of&#13;
funds for the asset creation (e.g., line departments, panchayat, community and WDC).&#13;
*  Once approved, a Memorandum of Understanding would be developed with the help of&#13;
the Project Manager in the WDC and the District Administration, and signed by all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-163-&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
relevant parties, to commit the proposed contributions from all sources. The SHG&#13;
would be responsible for the management of the asset once created, and may introduce&#13;
user/maintenance fees to ensure sustainability.&#13;
* The WDC would provide appropriate and timely feedback to the NGO and the SHG on&#13;
the status of their proposals; and the NGO and SHG would in turn report to the&#13;
community on the progress of the proposal, its implementation, and utilization of funds,&#13;
to ensure full accountability for the monies and for the assets created.&#13;
25.         All the social development activities described above would be supported by&#13;
appropriate information, education and communication activities and materials. In addition, in&#13;
order to create an enabling environment for women's efforts for social change, the project would&#13;
support gender sensitization programs which facilitate a positive attitude within communities&#13;
towards improved women's status.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.    The project would be implemented as a centrally sponsored scheme with the Department of&#13;
Women and Child Development (DWCD), Ministry of HJuman Resource Development, GO as the&#13;
overall nodal agency for the project. Within the states this function would be performed by the&#13;
State Department of Women and Child Development (Madhya Pradesh, Kamataka and Uttar&#13;
Pradesh), Department of Social Welfare (Bihar and Haryana) or Department of Industries and&#13;
Mines (Gujarat). The project would be executed by the State Women's Development Corporations&#13;
(WDCs)-1. The organizational structure for the project is shown in Charts I to 3.&#13;
B. Project Organisation&#13;
Overall Approach&#13;
2.    The primary approach of the project is to empower women through the creation of&#13;
effective self-help groups (SHGs). A key element in this would be the establishment of a trust-&#13;
based relationship between the women of the SHG and the NGO field worker. The&#13;
organizational design recognizes that the women of the SHG hold primary responsibility,&#13;
decision making authority, and accountability for their own success, and that the field worker&#13;
would advise and support them. A lot of effort would be placed upfront in orienting participating&#13;
NGOs/intervenors to the project's aims and approach.&#13;
3.    To ensure that the SHGs achieve success, the project seeks to strengthen over time the&#13;
institutions which would facilitate further development of the SHG concept and provide&#13;
specialist services to the women in response to emerging demands from the groups. The key&#13;
areas of specialist expertise include: (i) commercial and regional rural banks to provide credit to&#13;
SHGs; (ii) line departments to provide technical support services; (iii) specialist&#13;
consulting/training organizations to provide training to project participants; and (iv) specialist&#13;
agencies to provide assistance with product design, production techniques and marketing. The&#13;
interventions to support the participating public sector institutions in the context of the proposed&#13;
project are discussed below. Annexes 4 and 5 describe the organization and management role of&#13;
the SHGs and NGOs.&#13;
In Gujarat the term used is the Women's Economic Development Corporation and in Uttar Pradesh, the Women's Welfare&#13;
Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-166-&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Organizational Structure and Responsibilities&#13;
Central Project Support Unit, Department of Women and Child Development.&#13;
4.    As the Central Government department with the mandate for guiding and assisting states in&#13;
implementing projects to aid women's development, the Department of Women and Child&#13;
Development (DWCD) would be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the project. The&#13;
lead responsibility for supporting the project would be given to the Secretary, DWCD who would&#13;
be assisted by a Central Project Support Unit (CPSU).&#13;
5.    The main role of the CPSU would be to facilitate implementation of this decentralized&#13;
project with a focus on capacity building of the project implementors, information exchange and&#13;
coordination of the monitoring and evaluation of project performance. Within this framework, the&#13;
CPSU would be responsible for: (a) facilitating information exchange across the participating&#13;
states; (b) providing central administrative functions; (c) facilitating the collation nationwide and&#13;
dissemination of information on areas of common interest to the project through contracting out&#13;
periodic reviews/studies to specialist agencies and individuals; (d) implementing special studies;&#13;
and (e) organising any services which may span participating states, e.g., design of the M&amp;E&#13;
framework, generic training activities and production of communications materials. Further details&#13;
on the functions of the CPSU are given in Attachment 2.&#13;
6.    The CPSU would serve as a discussion partner with IDA/IFAD, GOI, state nodal&#13;
departments and WDCs on policy issues and at key milestones such as adjustments in project&#13;
design during implementation, the Mid-Term Review and further project development. The&#13;
CPSU's role at these times is intended to be broad direction setting.&#13;
7.    The CPSU would also be responsible for preparing an inventory of experts nationwide in&#13;
fields of direct relevance to project implementation, e.g., micro-credit, micro-enterprises, gender&#13;
sensitisation, appropriate technologies, etc., from which the participating states may draw as&#13;
required, on a contractual basis, to assist in project implementation.&#13;
8.    As part of its overall responsibility to commission studies on various aspects of project&#13;
performance, the CPSU would commission a special study by the end of the second year to&#13;
review the performance of the NGOs and the participatory management aspects of the project.&#13;
State Level&#13;
Women's Development Corporations (WDCs)&#13;
9.    Since the WDCs were established with the specific mandate to assist women in their quest&#13;
for economic independence, they represent the most appropriate institution at the state level to take&#13;
responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the project. Their mandate gives them a broad&#13;
focus whilst their establishment as Corporations confering greater independent decision making&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-167-&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
powers gives them greater operational flexibility than a government department in working with&#13;
NGOs and other private sector agencies.&#13;
10.   The WDCs would play an important role in promoting, guiding, coordinating and&#13;
monitoring the implementation of the project. Overall responsibility for the execution of the&#13;
project would be vested in the Managing Director, WDC. The management of the project would be&#13;
integrated into the regular organizational structure of the WDCs which would be modified to allow&#13;
for the establishment of administrative, finance, marketing and training and information units to&#13;
take responsibility for coordinating project implementation in their respective areas. Further details&#13;
of the responsibilities of the WDCs are given in Attachment 2.&#13;
11.   District level units, headed by a District Project Manager (DPM), would be established in&#13;
all the project districts (with the exception of UP). In UP, management of the project activities&#13;
would be sub-contracted by the WWC to the UP Land Development Corporation (UPLDC) in the&#13;
13 districts where formation of women's SHGs in on-going under the UP Sodic Lands&#13;
Development Project. UPLDC would manage the project through its existing management&#13;
structure in return for a management fee.&#13;
12.   The line management responsibilities for project implementation would be driven by the&#13;
Project Director working under the overall direction of the Managing Director. In addition to its&#13;
line management functions, the WDCs would also provide, at the state level, several specialist&#13;
functions which are needed at the field level but which are most economically shared across the&#13;
participating districts. These include training, marketing and communications.&#13;
13.   At the district level, the DPMs would play a critical role in building a "team" of those&#13;
assisting project implementation and facilitating the many linkages required between the SHGs and&#13;
NGO field workers, line departments, banks and training and support organizations. The DPMs&#13;
will provide feedback to the higher level management. In addition, the DPMs would ensure that&#13;
the NGOs and SHGs adopt the broader philosophies required to achieve the holistic objectives of&#13;
the project.&#13;
Public and Private Sector Technical Support Agencies&#13;
14.   Support for On-Farm activities. The technical line departments would be the principal&#13;
providers of training and other technical support services to women undertaking on-farm activities.&#13;
They would work closely with NGO field staff and resource persons identified by the group. In&#13;
providing technical support participatory assessment of the resource base available to women and&#13;
their perceptions and priorities would be undertaken before commencing the work. This will help&#13;
in selection of appropriate farming systems options. The principal departments involved would be:&#13;
Agriculture, Horticulture, Land Development/Soil Conservation, Irrigation, Minor Irrigation, and&#13;
2/    UP Land Development Corporation is a Government of UP owned agency. It is currently implementing an&#13;
IDA assisted and a EU assisted sodic lands reclamation project in 13 districts of the state. These projects&#13;
are making excellent progress. The Corporation is in full compliance with IDA requirements with regards&#13;
to financial management and all other legal requirements under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-168-&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Animal Husbandry. More specific information on the support to be provided under the project is&#13;
given in Annex 8. Provision is also made for funds for short consultancies for accessing specialist&#13;
expertise as required.&#13;
15.   Support for Non-farm Activities. Various private and public sector technical agencies&#13;
would be involved in providing support services for non-farm activities. These would include&#13;
state technical consultancy organizations or private consultancy groups who would undertake&#13;
techno-economic and market surveys and feasibility studies of potential off-farm enterprises.&#13;
Public sector design institutes, such as the National Institute of Design, and private designers&#13;
would provide assistance with upgradation of designs and production techniques, training of&#13;
mastercraftsmen and skill development training. Private sector market research organizations&#13;
would undertake market surveys and assist women producers in establishing market linkages.&#13;
Public and private sector entrepreneurship development organizations would be responsible for&#13;
providing entrepreneurship training. NGOs supporting the SHGs would be trained in business&#13;
development to improve their ability to guide women in the selection of appropriate activities&#13;
and to link women producers with the required support services. More information on specific&#13;
support to be provided under the project is given in Annex 9.&#13;
C. Capacity Building&#13;
16.   In view of the limited manpower resource and capacity of the main intervenors, the&#13;
project would assist in equipping them both to manage the project and to improve their ability to&#13;
provide better assistance to women in the longer term. In the center, DWCD will require&#13;
additional resources in order to oversee the implementation of the project. Since their&#13;
establishment the WDCs have not been adequately staffed nor provided with the requisite skills&#13;
such as business development, marketing, training and finance to effectively fulfill their&#13;
mandate. They have also suffered from discontinuity in top management due to a high turnover&#13;
of Managing Directors resulting in lack of leadership. In particular, they lack a field structure&#13;
preventing them from having the direct contact with their client group required to gain a sound&#13;
appreciation of the needs and priorities of women. To address these constraints, the project&#13;
would finance the provision of additional professional staff for DWCD and WDCs and necessary&#13;
support facilities and provide appropriate training and manpower development as specified&#13;
below. Inputs for strengthening other project implementors (NGOs, banks and line departments)&#13;
are described in Annexes 5, 7 and 8, respectively.&#13;
Manpower Resource&#13;
17.   CPSU. The CPSU would be staffed by three senior professionals-a Women's&#13;
Development Expert preferably with NGO experience; a Project Implementation Expert and a&#13;
Finance/Monitoring Expert-two second level officers (Administrative Officer and Accounts&#13;
Officer) and four support staff (two stenographers, one accounts assistant and one driver-cum-&#13;
peon). The key professional staff should preferably be women. Recruitment of these incremental&#13;
staff would be in phases in relation to the increasing workload of the project, and on such&#13;
contractual terms as not to involve any long-term liability on the part of GOI. Recruitment of the&#13;
three senior professionals would be through open competition and preferably from the open market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-169-&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
but serving government officers may participate in the competitive selection procedures with a&#13;
commitment to an extended tenure (at least three years). Terms of reference for the professional&#13;
staff are given in Attachment 3. In addition, the CPSU would have sufficient funding to contract&#13;
outside groups for key study/expert advice.&#13;
18.   WDCs. The key incremental professional staff required for the WDCs at the state level&#13;
would be a Project Director, (occupying the position of Chief General Manager in the WDC&#13;
hierarchy); Monitoring Officer; Marketing Coordinator; Training Coordinator; Communications&#13;
Officer; and Finance Officer. Incremental support staff would comprise accountant,&#13;
secretary/data processor, administrative assistant, office helper/peon and drivers as requireda All&#13;
incremental staff would be fitted into the modified organisational structure. In addition to the&#13;
provision of full-time staff, provision is made for contracting of specialist advice to assist in&#13;
resolving any project management issues or to improve the overall implementation of the project.&#13;
19.   The staff provided for the district offices would be a District Project Manager (DPM)&#13;
supported by a Business Development Officer, data processor, accountant, clerk/typist and one&#13;
support staff. All staff employed for the project would be expected to be computer literate. Terms&#13;
of Reference for the incremental WDC staff at the state and district levels are given in Attachment&#13;
4.&#13;
20.   In order to overcome the high turnover of government officers posted to the WDCs, all&#13;
staff at the state and district levels would be hired on contract through open competition and not&#13;
through direct transfer within the government system. Serving government officials may also be&#13;
considered for selection through competition. To recruit suitably qualified candidates for these&#13;
posts, the WDCs would constitute a Selection Committee comprising MD/WDC, a representative&#13;
of a prominent NGO in the state working on women's issues and a representative from the lending&#13;
institutions, preferably NABARD. Hiring of selected candidates would be subject to ratification&#13;
by the WDC Board. In hiring staff preference would be given to women. Recruitment of WDC&#13;
staff would be in phases in relation to the increasing workload.&#13;
Manpower Development and Training&#13;
21.   Implementation of the project will require orientation to concepts and approaches which are&#13;
presently not fully understood by many project intervenors. In particular, the characteristics of&#13;
SHGs is not widely appreciated whilst most project staff are not familiar with the participatory&#13;
approaches which will be central to the implementation of the project. These deficiencies would be&#13;
addressed under the project through orientation workshops and training as an on-going activity.&#13;
22.   State and District Level Orientation Workshops. An orientation workshop would be&#13;
held at the state level for members of the SPSC and SPWG to outline the project objectives,&#13;
underlying principles of the project, philosophy and concept of SHGs, role of the different partners&#13;
in project implementation and general awareness of women's perceptions, needs and priorities.&#13;
3/    Requirements vary between states depending on existing staff complement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-170-&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Similar workshops would be held in each district at the commencement of project activities for all&#13;
WDC district level staff, District Collectors/District Development Officers, Zilla Parishad/Taluka&#13;
Parishad presidents (of project talukas), district line department staff, bankers and other concerned&#13;
parties. The workshops would last for 1-2 days. The workshops would be repeated in Years 3 and&#13;
4 to allow for the turnover of staff.&#13;
23.   Orientation Workshop for WDC Staff. A 7- 1 0 day workshop would be organised by&#13;
each WDC for its key state and district level staff focusing on the following key areas: (a) project&#13;
objectives, strategy and components; (b) philosophy and concept of SHGs; (c) participatory&#13;
planning processes; (d) functioning of savings and credit; (e) role of NGOs in project&#13;
implementation; (f) awareness of women's perceptions, needs and priorities; (g) government&#13;
schemes relating to women; (h) communication and motivating skills and team building; (i)&#13;
administration and accounts systems for project; and () monitoring and evaluation arrangements.&#13;
The workshop would draw heavily on outside resource persons, particularly from NGOs&#13;
experienced in SHG programs.&#13;
24.   Familiarisation through Visits to Existing SHGs. During the first year of project&#13;
implementation, all senior WDC project staff at the state and district level would go on visits to&#13;
successful NGO-sponsored SHG programs either within the state (e.g., Bihar, Kamataka, Gujarat,&#13;
UP) where such strong SHGs exist or in other states such as Kamataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil&#13;
Nadu where NGOs such as MYRADA, Chaitanya and PRADAN have promoted SHGs over a&#13;
number of years and linkage with the banks has made most progress.&#13;
25.   Management Training. In order to build up the planning and management capacity of the&#13;
WDCs, provision would be made for management training for WDC staff on a continuing basis&#13;
either through contracting private management experts to design and conduct a series of workshops&#13;
or sending WDC staff on courses organised by reputed management and/or public administration&#13;
institutes. Topics to be covered would include personnel management, team building, planning and&#13;
scheduling, problem solving and time management techniques, and management systems.&#13;
26.   Computer Skills. Training in computer skills would be provided for all WDC professional&#13;
staff, data processors, accountants and typists so that all project records are computerized.&#13;
Financial Management at WDCs&#13;
27.   In order to strengthen their accounting and financial control procedures, the WDCs would&#13;
engage experienced independent financial management consultants to review the existing&#13;
accounting, audit and financial control procedures and where necessary provide guidance on the&#13;
modifications rquired in order to establish accounting, auditing and internal practices acceptable&#13;
to IDA. Terms of Reference are given in Attachment 5.&#13;

Annex 11&#13;
Long-Term Role of WDCs&#13;
28.   Recent studies- commissioned on the role and perfornance of the WDCs highlighted a&#13;
number of areas of weakness and recommended strengthening them to make them more effective&#13;
promoters of the all round development of women (see Attachment 1). Until now these&#13;
recommendations have not been acted upon and the actions proposed under the project (as listed&#13;
above) represent the first step towards addressing these issues. The next step would be, after a&#13;
reasonable period of time, to assess the performance of the WDCs as the key project&#13;
implementing agencies and to assess their long term role in assisting women's development and&#13;
empowerment. Accordingly, the CPSU would commission a study prior to the Mid-Term&#13;
Review to re-assess the future role of the WDCs against the background of the overall changing&#13;
environment within the country and the broadening of the activities of the WDCs brought about&#13;
under the project. The findings of this review would be used at the Mid-Term Review to guide&#13;
the introduction of necessary changes in organizational structure, management systems and&#13;
human resource development strategy. Terms of Reference for the study are given in Attachment&#13;
6.&#13;
D. Policy Guidance and Coordination Assistance&#13;
29.   A large number of institutions will need to effectively work together and coordinate&#13;
activities to achieve the full impact of the project. To provide necessary guidance and coordination&#13;
support a number of committees and working groups would be established (Chart 2) to guide&#13;
implementation as per the guiding principles of the project. The committees and working groups&#13;
would meet at regular intervals to facilitate effective execution of the project.&#13;
State Level&#13;
30.   A State Project Steering Committee (SPSC) would be established by Government Order,&#13;
to provide overall guidance and support during project implementation. The SPSC would be&#13;
chaired by the Chief Secretary (or his nominee) with the Project Director as Member Secretary.&#13;
The Secretary of the nodal agency would be the convenor. Other members (or their designates)&#13;
would be:&#13;
Secretaries of key line departments as appropriate (Finance, Planning, Women and&#13;
Child Development, Social Welfare, Industries,);&#13;
State Chief General Manager of NABARD;&#13;
General Managers of commercial/regional rural banks (2 in rotation); and&#13;

Annex 11&#13;
Outside experts (4) with established reputation of working on women's issues and/or&#13;
technical expertise relevant to project implementation.&#13;
31.   The outside experts would be proposed by the WDC for appointment by the government&#13;
and serve for a maximum of three years. After the second year, approximately one-third of the non-&#13;
official members would retire each year to make way for new members. This will enable the&#13;
project to draw on a wider cross-section of experienced resource persons.&#13;
32.   The key functions of the SPSC would be to: (a) provide overall policy guidance; (b)&#13;
provide a forum for dialogue between state level policy makers and non-governmental experts with&#13;
field level experience of women's issues; (c) review progress and performance of the project; and&#13;
(d) resolve implementation problems which require higher level intervention. The SPSC would&#13;
meet quarterly initially and later half-yearly. The SPSC would establish expert-groups as required&#13;
to advise on specific aspects of the project e.g. the selection and capacity building of NGOs for&#13;
implementation of project activities. This could include drawing on expertise from outside the&#13;
state to carry out investigations if required.&#13;
33.   At the working level the project would be supported by a State Project Working Group&#13;
(SPWG), chaired by the Secretary of the nodal department. SPWG would assist with coordination&#13;
of operational activities, especially those involving other line departments, for effective project&#13;
implementation. The membership of the SPWG would comprise:&#13;
-     MD and Project Director!WDC;&#13;
-     Directors of the key line departments (as appropriate);&#13;
-     NABARD and 2 participating bank representatives (in rotation from amongst those&#13;
banks financing significant numbers of SHGs);&#13;
-     2 NGO partners (in rotation);&#13;
-     state M&amp;E agency representative;&#13;
3 selected SHG representatives (in rotation and representing different districts and&#13;
NGO sponsors).&#13;
34.   The selected representatives would serve for a maximum of two years. The overall&#13;
functions of the SPWG would be to create an enabling environment for project implementation,&#13;
with particular reference to the linkages with the banks and line departments, through providing&#13;
necessary guidance and directions to the line department staff, and to remove bottlenecks as needed&#13;
in order to push forward project implementation. The SPWG would meet bi-monthly or more&#13;
frequently if necessary.&#13;
District Level&#13;
35.   A District Project Coordinating Committee (DPCC) would be established by Government&#13;
Order in each project district. This committee would be chaired by the District Collector (or&#13;
equivalent) and with the District Development Officer or Chief Executive Officer as Vice&#13;
Chairman and the WDC District Project Manager as Member Secretary. Other members of the&#13;
DPCC would be:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-173-&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
representatives of Zilla Panchayat and selected Taluka Panchayats;&#13;
district heads of the concerned line agencies;&#13;
NABARD District Development Manager and/or Lead Bank Manager;&#13;
2 managers of participating banks (in rotation from amongst banks financing&#13;
significant numbers of SHGs);&#13;
representatives of all partner NGOs and other SHG promoters;&#13;
4-6 selected SHG representatives (in rotation and representing different NGO&#13;
sponsors).&#13;
A representative of the WDC at the state level would attend at regular intervals.&#13;
36.   The key responsibilities of the DPCC would be to ensure line department/bank support to&#13;
SHGs; to plan support services required, to review progress and to resolve implementation&#13;
problems. It would specifically: (a) provide a forum for interchange of views between all&#13;
participants in project implementation at the district level; and (b) review progress and performance&#13;
of the project; and (c) initiate appropriate action to remove implementation blockages.&#13;
Cluster Level&#13;
37.   A Cluster Level Working Group (CLWG) would be established for a cluster of around 20&#13;
villages being supported by a single NGO. Membership of the CLWG would comprise:&#13;
key Panchayati raj representatives;&#13;
-     NGO representatives;&#13;
-     key line department extension workers;&#13;
-     bank branch managers;&#13;
-     4-6 selected SHG representatives.&#13;
38.   A WDC district representative would initially be involved as the convenor but this function&#13;
would be handed over to a local representative elected by the CLWG. The functions of the CLWG&#13;
would be to provide a forum for regular interaction between beneficiaries and project implementors&#13;
to ensure the responsiveness of the project to the expressed needs of the beneficiaries; to facilitate&#13;
the provision of the necessary support for the groups' economic and social activities; to maintain&#13;
oversight on the progress of the project and to establish linkages between SHGs and the service&#13;
providers required to sustain and further the development of the SHG members in the long term.&#13;
The CLWG would meet monthly.&#13;
E. Project Management&#13;
39.   A reputed management institute, would be contracted by the CPSU to develop a&#13;
Computerised Project Management system (CPM) and Management Information System (MIS)&#13;
(as part of the overall M&amp;E system design) for use (with refinements as required) by all the WDCs&#13;
in the participating states. Each participating state would hire an independent M&amp;E agency to&#13;
initially operate the CPM/MIS systems following training by the lead agency. The state M&amp;E&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-174-&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
agencies would train the WDCs in the operation of the CPM and MIS systems so that they are&#13;
gradually able to take over the monitoring role to support project management. (See Annex 14 for&#13;
details of the monitoring and evaluation system).&#13;
40.   Annual Action Plans would be developed from the CPM, which would be adjusted as&#13;
required to reflect changes that have to be made to the initial plans as a result of actual field&#13;
experience in project implementation. This will provide details of all tasks to be undertaken during&#13;
the year including timing, manpower and financial resources and established milestones. The&#13;
Annual Action Plans would provide the basis framework for organising the project activities.&#13;
However, to ensure that the project remains responsive to the needs of the SHG members, the&#13;
Annual Action Plans would be revised on a quarterly basis in the light of the specific requests for&#13;
assistance expressed by the SHGs.&#13;
41.   Review Processes. Annual review and planning workshops and annual beneifciary&#13;
workshops would be held at the state and district levels providing an opportunity for project&#13;
beneficiaries and implementors to inter-actively review project performance and incorporate&#13;
improvements into the implementation of the project. In addition, inter-state workshops would&#13;
be held to facilitate information sharing between states enabling states to benefit from the&#13;
learning experiences of other states in implementation of various project activities.&#13;

Attachment 1&#13;
BACKGROUND AND ASSESSMENT&#13;
OF WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS&#13;
1.    As an outcome of the International Women's Decade which ended in 1985, GOI&#13;
requested all states to set up Women's Development Corporations (WDCs) as part of the strategy&#13;
to switch the focus of women's development initiatives from welfare to development. The&#13;
WDCs were established as autonomous government undertakings in which the share capital&#13;
would be contributed by GOI and the state governments in the ratio of 49%:51%. The&#13;
authorized share capital of the WDCs is generally around Rs. 50 million of which around Rs. 20-&#13;
25 million has been paid up in the case of most of the WDCs.&#13;
2.    Nodal agency and incorporation status. Amongst the WDCs participating in the&#13;
project there are some variations in terms of their parent department and incorporation status. In&#13;
Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, the nodal department for the WDC is the&#13;
Department of Women and Child Development. In Bihar and Haryana, the WDCs come under&#13;
the auspices of the Department of Social Welfare whilst in Gujarat, the Department of Industries&#13;
and Mines is the nodal department.&#13;
3     Most of the WDCs (Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh) are incorporated&#13;
under the Companies Act with the WDC in Madhya Pradesh incorporated under the MP Non-&#13;
Trading Corporations Rules and Act. The main exception is the Bihar WDC which is registered&#13;
under the Societies Registration Act. Many of the WDCs are seeking exemption from income&#13;
tax through classification as non-profit organizations under Section 25 of the Companies Act (or&#13;
other provisions specific to their states). The activities and operational procedures of the WDCs&#13;
are controlled by the Boards of Directors and they are not obliged to follow government norms&#13;
and procedures.&#13;
4.    Each WDC has a Board of Directors of between 3 and 15 persons. The prescribed&#13;
composition of the Board between officials and non-officials varies between WDCs. In Gujarat&#13;
and MP the provisions allow for at least half of the directors to be non-officials, who are&#13;
generally political appointees. In Karnataka all directors are appointed by the state government.&#13;
In most cases the Boards have been superseded and are presently composed solely of officials.&#13;
5.    Only Haryana and Gujarat WDCs have their own district managers or field officers with&#13;
limited supporting staff. The other WDCs function at the district level through the staff of other&#13;
departments, who are generally paid an additional small stipend.&#13;
6.    The principal role of the WDCs is to promote the economic development of women&#13;
through: (a) facilitating access to training and entrepreneurship development; (b) helping women&#13;
entrepreneurs to gain access to credit available under various bankable schemes through&#13;
sanctioning women's applications, and through the provision of capital subsidy or margin money&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-176-&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
(low interest loans) to enable women to fulfill the banks' requirements for borrower's equity&#13;
contribution; (c) facilitating access to markets through organizing periodic exhibitions/sales,&#13;
financing women producers to attend such sales outside of the state; tie-up arrangements with&#13;
state level marketing organizations or government departments; or through assisting women&#13;
producers to establish marketing cooperatives; and (d) conducting of camps, seminars, etc., to&#13;
increase women's general level of awareness.&#13;
7.    Assistance is provided to all women, rural and urban, although some schemes which the&#13;
WDCs implement are targeted at women below the poverty line. The WDCs organize skill&#13;
development training in a range of skills, both conventional and non-conventional, including&#13;
tailoring, knitwear, typing, beauty culture, electronics and electrical repairs, computing, etc.&#13;
Training is conducted through direct engagement of specialized trainers by the WDCs as required&#13;
or through contracts with NGOs. All the WDCs participating in the project consider their major&#13;
responsibility is to play a promotional and catalytic role and, unlike some WDCs, none of them&#13;
are involved in the direct management of production units to provide employment for women.&#13;
8.    Budgets. The level of operations currently implemented by the WDCs is modest with&#13;
annual expenditures on programs in the range of Rs. 7-26 million per WDC. The main sources&#13;
of funds for programs are: (a) funds received from DWCD under special programs, e.g., NORAD&#13;
funds for training, STEP program; (b) contributions from state governments; and (c) interest&#13;
earnings generated by the WDCs on their share capital. Some WDCs (Bihar, Karnataka) do also&#13;
receive budgetary support for their administrative costs, whilst others (Uttar Pradesh, Madhya&#13;
Pradesh) are totally reliant on the interest earnings on their capital to pay for the operating costs&#13;
of the Corporation.&#13;
Assessment of WDCs&#13;
9.    The WDCs were established as there was no nodal point at the state level for women's&#13;
economic development. They were given a broad mandate but since their establishment, they&#13;
have suffered from a number of major constraints which have precluded them from performing&#13;
their intended role effectively. These include:&#13;
(a)   Lack of adequate finance. Lack of resources has limited the scale of activities of&#13;
the WDCs. Lack of clarity over their role as promotional or commercial&#13;
organizations has frequently left the WDCs without adequate coverage of their&#13;
administrative costs or the capacity to expand their promotional role. This has&#13;
also resulted in some cases in the share capital being eroded to finance&#13;
administrative expenses.&#13;
(b)   Inadequate staffing. The WDCs have not been adequately staffed nor provided&#13;
with the requisite skills, viz., business development, marketing, training and&#13;
finance. They have suffered from discontinuity in top management through the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-177-&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
high turnover of Managing Directors who are generally IAS officers on&#13;
deputation. This has resulted in a lack of continuity in the strategies adopted to&#13;
achieve the aims and objectives. In particular, they lack a field structure&#13;
preventing them from having the direct contact with their client group required to&#13;
effectively implement programs and to gain a sound appreciation of the needs and&#13;
priorities of women which they are expected to address.&#13;
(c)   Weak management procedures. Inadequate attention has been paid to establishing&#13;
effective management procedures for the WDCs. As a result, accounting systems,&#13;
auditing and planning procedures and monitoring and evaluation systems are&#13;
deficient.&#13;
(d)   Lack of follow-up support to women entrepreneurs. The WDCs have lacked the&#13;
resources to provide any back-up support to the self-employment activities they&#13;
have been instrumental in promoting.&#13;
9.    Two recent appraisals of the role of the WDCs6 commissioned by DWCD and DANIDA&#13;
have supported the need to strengthen the WDCs to enable them to be more effective promoters&#13;
of women's economic development. They have concluded that it is essential for the WDCs to&#13;
exist and to be strengthened in order to be able to more effectively champion the cause of the all&#13;
round development of women. These studies have highlighted the following points:&#13;
(a)   Strengthening the organizational structure and clarifying the role of the WDCs&#13;
would facilitate their efforts for the enhancement of women's economic status;&#13;
(b)   WDCs should play a promotional, catalytic and coordinating role;&#13;
(c)   While WDCs should aim to serve all women, priority should be on reaching rural&#13;
and urban poor women;&#13;
(d)   WDCs should widen their horizons and become more involved in the overall&#13;
socio-economic advancement of women including playing a greater advocacy&#13;
role;&#13;
(e)   WDCs should be provided with adequate budgetary support to cover their&#13;
promotional activities;&#13;

I1.    The role of the CPSU would be capacity building of the project implementors, information&#13;
exchange, and coordination of monitoring and evaluation of project performance.&#13;
2.    The principal responsibilities of the CPSU would be to:&#13;
(a)   Facilitate information exchange across states. It is hoped that the states will move&#13;
towards rich information sharing (e.g., training and communications materials,&#13;
research, lessons learned) by establishing an informal network amongst themselves&#13;
including organisation of a program of inter-state workshops hosted by states in&#13;
turn. The CPSU would monitor to make sure that this is happening, and propose&#13;
any forums, for sharing mechanisms which are not naturally being developed.&#13;
(b)   Provide central administrative fnctions. These include: (i) facilitating release of&#13;
funds from GOI to the participating states; (ii) ensuring submission of annual action&#13;
plans and progress reports by the states for onward submission to WB/IFAD; and&#13;
(iii) contracting any services which may span participating states, e.g., contracting&#13;
the lead M&amp;E agency to develop the CPM/MIS systems across the states;&#13;
commissioning of production of films, e.g., for the promotion of micro-enterprise&#13;
development, which can be used across all the states.&#13;
(c)   Facilitate learning over time. This would include facilitating the collation and&#13;
dissemination of information on key areas of relevance to project implementation&#13;
through contracting out periodic reviews/studies to specialist agencies or&#13;
individuals. Key areas which can be identified at the outset would include:&#13;
(i)  collation of information and experience nationwide on women's&#13;
development efforts and approaches in the government and non-government&#13;
sectors;&#13;
(ii)  collation of information and experience nationwide on approaches to gender&#13;
sensitisation, materials available, etc., in the government and non-&#13;
government sectors;&#13;
(iii)  preparation of an inventory of training and communications materials&#13;
available nationwide in areas of relevance to the project, e.g., group&#13;

independent M&amp;E agencies and ensure the incorporation of lessons learnt into&#13;
project design and implementation processes&#13;
Women's Development Corporation (WDCs)&#13;
3.    The key role played by the WDCs would be in promoting the project concept, and guiding,&#13;
coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the project.&#13;
4.    The main line responsibilities of the WDCs at the state and district levels would be: (a)&#13;
providing overall direction and guidance to the project including promoting and safeguarding the&#13;
project concept and re-orienting project strategies in line with new thinking on women's issues and&#13;
in response to women's evolving needs and priorities; (b) coordinating the required project inputs&#13;
for mobilisation of women, nurturing of SHGs, and access to resources for development; (c)&#13;
contracting with NGOs and other project partners; (d) monitoring and supervising project&#13;
implementation; (e) liaising with the state M&amp;E agency contracted to undertake concurrent&#13;
monitoring and evaluation; (f) liaising with the line departments, banks and other implementing&#13;
agencies; (g) releasing funds to the partner implementing agencies; (h) preparing annual and&#13;
quarterly action plans and budgets; (i) preparing quarterly progress reports; and () preparing and&#13;
submitting reimbursement claims to DWCD for onward transmission to the Department of&#13;
Economic Affairs, GOI.&#13;
NGOs&#13;
5.    The role of the NGOs would be to mobilise poor women in the community, assist them to&#13;
form SHGs and provide on-going support to nurture and sustain the SHGs. This would include&#13;
providing awareness raising for SHG members, training in capacity building for the SHGs,&#13;
facilitating linkage with lending institutions and ensuring access of SHG members to the necessary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

technical support services for their selected income generating activities. In addition, the more&#13;
experienced NGOs would play a key role in capacity building of less experienced NGOs and&#13;
orientation of project implementors to the SHG concept and participatory processes. Full details of&#13;
the responsibilities of the NGOs are given in Annex 5.&#13;
Technical Support Agencies&#13;
6.    Technical support agencies, comprising both line departments and private sector&#13;
agencies/individuals would be responsible for providing women with the necessary information to&#13;
assist them in the selection of appropriate income generating activities and for providing technical&#13;
support through training, technology transfer, assistance with the establishment of market linkages&#13;
to ensure the success of their business activities.&#13;
Lending institutions&#13;
7.    Banks and other lending institutions would be responsible for providing credit to the SHGs&#13;
based on their assessment of the credit management capability of the SHG.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
FOR UPGRADING WDC FINANCIAL SYSTEMS&#13;
1.    At present the level of financial transactions undertaken by the WDCs is minimal. As a&#13;
result, they do not have appropriate financial management procedures in place to cope with the&#13;
increasing workload under the project. In addition, with the incorporation of district level units and&#13;
activities there is a need to put in place more systematic and rigorous accounting and control&#13;
procedures. The WDCs will also need to establish separate accounts for the project which can be&#13;
independently audited in a timely manner.&#13;
2.    To upgrade the financial management systems, the WDCs would engage experienced&#13;
independent consultants to carry out a review of the existing accounting and financial control&#13;
procedures and assist in the establishment of upgraded systems at both the head quarters and district&#13;
levels for accounting, auditing and internal control which are acceptable to IDA. More specifically&#13;
the consultants would:&#13;
(a)   review and implement necessary changes to upgrade the existing accounting&#13;
systems and procedures;&#13;
(b)   review the existing internal and extemal audit procedures and recommend necessary&#13;
changes;&#13;
(c)   review the existing internal control procedures and upgrade them to internationally&#13;
acceptable standards; and&#13;
(d)   train WDC accounts and management staff in the modified procedures and oversee&#13;
the implementation of the improved procedures.&#13;
3.    Time frame and reporting&#13;
The work would commence immediately after completion of the audit work in progress of&#13;
pending accounts and would be completed by June 1997.&#13;

Annex 11&#13;
Attachment 6&#13;
STUDY ON LONG-TERM ROLE OF WDCs&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
1.    Two recent appraisals of the WDCs7 supported the need to strengthen the WDCs to enable&#13;
them to be more effective promoters of the all round development of women. However, given the&#13;
limited role being currently played by WDCs, to date, no action has been taken to operationalize&#13;
these recommendations. The actions proposed under the project for the immediate strengthening of&#13;
the WDCs to manage the project will go some way to addressing the issues raised in these studies.&#13;
Once the WDCs have gained experience through implementation of their expanded role under the&#13;
project, it would be timely to further review the progress they have made and to re-assess the long-&#13;
term role of the WDCs against the background of changes in the overall environment within the&#13;
country and the specific changes made in widening the scope of the WDCs' activities as a result of&#13;
the project. Accordingly, prior to the Mid-Term Review, the CPSU would commission a study&#13;
from consultants/individuals with wide-ranging experience of institutional development and&#13;
women's issues to review the performance and to make recommendations on the long-term roles of&#13;
the WDCs. The findings of this review would be used at Mid-Term Review to guide introduction&#13;
of changes in the roles and responsibilities of WDCs. More specifically the study would:&#13;
(a)   undertake an assessment of the performance of the WDCs under the on-going&#13;
project;&#13;
(b)   critically analyse the future role of the WDCs;&#13;
(c)   suggest changes in the organizational structure required to meet the future needs&#13;
specifying relationships with public and private sector institutions including NGOs&#13;
and lending institutions;&#13;
(d)   specify improvements in management systems required to make the operation of&#13;
the WDCs more efficient in carrying out its responsibilities; and&#13;
(e)   recommend requirements for capacity building to enable the WDCs to perform their&#13;
role more effectively.&#13;

Annex 12&#13;
INDIA&#13;
RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
TRAINING&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.   In order to support project activities in each state, a comprehensive training program&#13;
would be implemented to upgrade the skills of WDCs, NGOs, SHGs, lending institutions and&#13;
line departments in a variety of areas. It is expected that training needs would evolve during the&#13;
project in a manner corresponding to the evolution of SHGs and their activities. The major&#13;
phases currently envisaged in the project are: (a) pre-project, (b) project start-up, (c) project&#13;
build-up, and (d) stabilization (see Annex 16).&#13;
I In the pre-project phase, the emphasis would be on appointment of key staff in the&#13;
WDCs at state and district levels, and on working out common approaches for several&#13;
sub-components of the project including training, communications, and monitoring&#13;
and evaluation.&#13;
* In the start-up phase, the focus of activity would be on the establishment of SHGs&#13;
capable of managing savings and credit operations. During this phase the capacities of&#13;
WVDCs and NGOs to form and support SHGs would be developed, and institutional&#13;
arrangements for the project would be worked out in detail. Communications&#13;
activities focussed on whole village communities would help to build a supportive&#13;
environment for the project.&#13;
* In the build-up phase, the institutional capacity to manage the project would be&#13;
greatly strengthened, including that of support agencies such as banks, line&#13;
departments and technical resource agencies. During this phase, linkages between&#13;
SHGs and lending institutions would be developed in order to ensure women's&#13;
continued access to credit.&#13;
* The stabilization phase is characterised by increasing involvement of SHGs in&#13;
income generating activities, through provision of skills training, design assistance,&#13;
technology and market linkages. In addition, women's access to better health and&#13;
drudgery reducing technologies would be enhanced, and community assets created,&#13;
which would call for additional training of SHGs and project implementors in the&#13;
social aspects related to the project.&#13;
2.    Training activities in each phase would build on those in the previous phase with the help&#13;
of training needs assessments (TNAs), overseen by the Training Coordinator of the WDC, and&#13;
on feedback from the monitoring and evaluation system. The TNAs would be conducted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-202-&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
periodically to: (a) identify the training needs of staff at all levels by functional groups; (b) match&#13;
available training resources with identified needs, and specify gaps in training resources in each&#13;
state. These steps would lead to the preparation of a training plan and appropriate training&#13;
programs for the next phase of the project. Both the TNAs and the M&amp;E system would provide&#13;
information to evaluate previous training efforts, which would be used to improve subsequent&#13;
training.&#13;
Contents of Training Component&#13;
3.    The following areas of training are envisaged as key for the members of SHGs and staff&#13;
of WDCs and NGOs. The first three areas listed below would also be applied to the staff of&#13;
lending institutions, line departments and other technical support agencies, while the latter two&#13;
would be provided to this group if needed and/or in appropriately modified form..&#13;
*  The SHG concept and approach: principles of cooperation; group dynamics and&#13;
group management, including the formation and organization of groups; roles and&#13;
responsibilities of group members; characteristics of good groups; group activities,&#13;
meetings and minute-keeping; and collective action;&#13;
- Participatory processes, and the importance of the participatory approach in&#13;
stimulating and supporting group activities through all phases of the project;&#13;
3  Communications skills, including information gathering, negotiation and conflict&#13;
resolution, and monitoring and evaluation skills;&#13;
-  Savings and credit management, including formal and informal banking systems,&#13;
dealing with financial institutions, processing of loans and their repayment, utilization&#13;
of loans and the maintenance of assets created out of loans, establishment of interest&#13;
rates and repayment periods, loan defaults and related issues, understanding&#13;
passbooks; and&#13;
*  Accounting, maintenance of basic books of accounts, record keeping and report&#13;
writing.&#13;
4.    Further, specific modules would be developed to meet the training needs of particular&#13;
groups, including:&#13;
*  Economic organization for SHGs: economic rules, the benefits of collective savings&#13;
and investment, collective bargaining, importance of occupation specific skills, and&#13;
potential for economic activity;&#13;
*  Planning and management for WDC staff: management skills, planning, financial&#13;
management, critical path scheduling, management systems, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-203-&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
Entrepreneurship and business development for NGOs, to improve their ability to&#13;
guide women in selection of appropriate income generating activities and coordinate&#13;
the provision of necessary support systems.&#13;
5.    Gender sensitization would be an important aspect of the training of all project&#13;
participants, and would include topics such as the need for collective action among women to&#13;
combat social, economic and political problems, empowerment of women at the grassroots,&#13;
women heads of households, and legal safeguards.&#13;
6.    At the start of the project, the focus would be on training SHGs, NGOs and WDC staff in&#13;
the five areas listed in para 3 above; and all project implementors, i.e., NGOs, WDCs, lending&#13;
institutions and line departments, would be trained in the topics noted, and would be gender&#13;
sensitized. From the second year of the project, the need for technical/production skills and&#13;
business development training for SHG members would develop and would be provided as the&#13;
women begin to take up income generating activities. The scope of the skills development&#13;
program would be determined by the activities adopted by the women from the menu of options&#13;
prepared for income generating activities (see Annexes 8 and 9). Such training would be&#13;
coordinated with the relevant line department where applicable. Training would also be&#13;
organized in nutrition, health, family welfare and other issues, depending on the needs and&#13;
demand expressed by group members.&#13;
Training Activities at the State Level&#13;
7.    Based on the broad areas of training identified above for SHGs and project implementors,&#13;
the following training-related activities would be undertaken in the project:&#13;
(a)   Preparation of an Inventory of Training Resources. To facilitate the WDCs in&#13;
formulating the overall training plan, each WDC would prepare an inventory of&#13;
existing training programs, resources and materials available in, or accessible to,&#13;
the state. Terms of reference are given in Attachment 1. This inventory would&#13;
also identify the gaps in training resources within the state level which could&#13;
specifically be redressed with the assistance of resources from outside the state.&#13;
The WDCs would need to access this database regularly to identify appropriate&#13;
training resources for the different training requirements under the project, and&#13;
therefore the inventory would be "user friendly". The inventory would focus on&#13;
the following:&#13;
(i)   Identification of NGOs and other agencies in or available to the state&#13;
which have the capacity to conduct training appropriate to project needs;&#13;
(ii)   Development of a detailed catalogue of the training programs run by these&#13;
NGOs and agencies and their availability for (i) WDC staff, (ii) NGOs,&#13;
(iii) SHGs, (iv) banks, (v) line departments, (vi) technical support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-204-&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
agencies; the catalogue should specify type of training, duration,&#13;
availability during the year and costs;&#13;
(iii)  Identification of key training materials available with the training&#13;
agencies, or from other accessible sources, which can be utilized in the&#13;
training programs, for refresher training, or as reference materials for the&#13;
trainees in the above categories;&#13;
(iv)   Assessment of the capacity of these training agencies to provide training to&#13;
the above groups during the project and, where applicable, identification&#13;
of the training needs of the organizations themselves, to equip them to&#13;
conduct training which is relevant to the project;&#13;
(v)    Assessment of the costs of different training modules offered by these&#13;
agencies.&#13;
(b)    Development of Training Strategy. Given the varied and evolving nature of the&#13;
training requirements under the project, it would be useful for the states to inter-&#13;
actively develop a framework for training with the assistance of an institution&#13;
experienced in the planning and implementation of training programs. The CPSU&#13;
would identify a lead training institute to organise a workshop to help the&#13;
participating states to develop the training strategy in the pre-project phase. The&#13;
strategy would be supported by identified modules for each type of training, and&#13;
information on the duration, location and agency which would be responsible for&#13;
providing the training. The lead institute would work closely with the state&#13;
WDCs and implementing NGOs to:&#13;
(i)    clarify with each state, through a participatory process, the training&#13;
priorities of the project, and develop the training strategy;&#13;
(ii)   assess state-specific training needs in conjunction with the various project&#13;
affiliates: WDCs, NGOs, SHGs, banks, line departments, and technical&#13;
support agencies;&#13;
(iii)  assist WDCs, as necessary, in identifying appropriate training modules and&#13;
materials and institutions/individuals who could develop additional&#13;
modules/materials to fill gaps in these training resources;&#13;
(iv)   undertake training of trainers, as necessary, to further develop the&#13;
capacities of identified institutions to meet the training needs of the&#13;
project.&#13;
This work would build on the inventory of training resources prepared in each state, and&#13;
would in turn help to refine the inventory.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-205-&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
(c)    Training Plans. Based on this strategy, each WDC would prepare an annual&#13;
training plan, which would be updated quarterly, and also take into account&#13;
feedback received from the concurrent M&amp;E, to regularly reassess training needs.&#13;
The training plan would separately identify: (i) the target group to receive&#13;
training, including trainers; (ii) the issues/subjects to be addressed; (iii) the&#13;
number of staff to be trained in each category, and number of courses, batches&#13;
and trainees each year; (iv) the availability of training programs and materials;&#13;
(v) the need to develop new training curricula, modules and materials; and (vi)&#13;
the unit cost of training. This training plan would need to be flexible, and capable&#13;
of addressing the evolving needs of the project. Utilizing the training strategy,&#13;
training plan and the inventory of training resources, the Training Coordinator and&#13;
District Project Managers would make the necessary arrangements for the training&#13;
programs and participation of relevant persons. Ensuring the timeliness of&#13;
training would be one of the most important tasks of the Training Coordinator and&#13;
Project Director. The initial phases of the project provide the opportunity to&#13;
develop the training resources that would be necessary to carry out training in the&#13;
later, more complex stages of project implementation.&#13;
(d)    Training Needs Assessments. Training needs assessments would be conducted&#13;
periodically to determine the training requirements for the next phase of project&#13;
implementation. The training strategy would provide guidance regarding these,&#13;
and the lead training institute would help the WDCs to identify appropriate&#13;
institutions to carry out these assessments.&#13;
(e)    Appointment of a Training Coordinator. The WDCs would take early action&#13;
to identify a Training Coordinator at the state level to plan and coordinate the&#13;
overall training program for the project in the state and oversee its phased&#13;
implementation. The hiring of the Training Coordinator is a Condition of&#13;
Negotiations.&#13;
(f)    Criteria for Selection of Training Institutions. The criteria to be used in&#13;
choosing appropriate training agencies would include:&#13;
(i)   Institutional data, including the history of the organization, its appropriate&#13;
training experience, its past and present capacity to conduct relevant&#13;
training programs, the qualifications of its trainers, its strategies for&#13;
upgrading and refreshing the skills of trainers, availability of its training&#13;
capacity at short notice, and the costs per program;&#13;
(ii)   The types of training conducted: Who are the target groups? Are the&#13;
modules congruent with the training needs of the project? Is the duration&#13;
of the training programs suitable for the persons to be trained in this&#13;
project? Are the training methods appropriate for the trainees and in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-206-&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
keeping with the project's participatory principles? What training&#13;
materials are available and/or used?&#13;
(iii)  The development of training modules: Was it needs-based? Was there an&#13;
adequate system of evaluation and feedback? Was the feedback&#13;
incorporated while refining the training modules? Does the institution&#13;
have the ability and flexibility to adapt the contents and methods of their&#13;
training to project and local needs, issues, problems, demands?&#13;
(iv)   A cross-check with target groups on the usefulness of the training as well&#13;
as the quality of the trainers; and&#13;
(g)   Follow-up of Training Implementation. The lead training institution would&#13;
continue to provide guidance and advice to the state WDCs throughout project&#13;
implementation. Possible areas of assistance include: (i) reviewing and revising&#13;
the training strategy; (ii) conducting training needs assessments in conjunction&#13;
with the various project affiliates; (iii) developing appropriate training modules;&#13;
(iv) undertaking training of trainers; (v) putting WDCs in touch with out-of-state&#13;
training resources at their request; (vi) following up the effectiveness of the&#13;
training strategy; and (vii) developing a system for inter-state sharing of&#13;
experiences. In instances where there are very few persons to be trained in a state&#13;
in some specific aspect of the project, the lead institute would assist the WDCs in&#13;
the different states to coordinate their efforts to organise a joint training program&#13;
and share their resources.&#13;
(h)   Training for Income Generating Activities. Techno-economic surveys would be&#13;
undertaken to generate a menu of options for income generating activities that&#13;
could be taken up by SHGs. Depending on the activities adopted from this menu&#13;
by SHG members, a skills training program would be developed at the appropriate&#13;
time by the WDCs. The Training Coordinator would therefore need to work&#13;
closely with the technical agencies supporting development of the income&#13;
generating activities.&#13;
(i)    Monitoring and Evaluation. A system would be developed for monitoring the&#13;
effectiveness of training programs on an on-going basis and feedback from this&#13;
monitoring would be utilized to improve the focus and quality of these training&#13;
programs.&#13;
(j)    Coordination. The Training Coordinator in each state WDC would work&#13;
especially closely with the Communications Officer, to ensure that the training&#13;
and communications strategies and activities are well coordinated throughout the&#13;
project, to avoid duplication, and to maximize the mutual reinforcement that&#13;
would take place between these efforts.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
1.   In order to support project activities in each state, a comprehensive training program&#13;
would be implemented for upgrading the skills of WDCs, NGOs, SHG members, banks, line&#13;
departments and technical resource agencies in a variety of areas. During the pilot phase of the&#13;
project, the WDC in each state will appoint a Training Coordinator, responsible for matters&#13;
relating to training and skill development. The Training Coordinator would work with a team to&#13;
develop the comprehensive training program. The team would consider several factors while&#13;
formulating the program: (a) the target group to receive training; (b) the issues/subjects that need&#13;
to be addressed; (c) the number of staff in each category to be trained; (d) the phasing of training,&#13;
and consequently the type and number of training courses, batches and trainees each year; (e) the&#13;
need for training of trainers; (f) the availability of appropriate training curricula, modules and&#13;

INDIA&#13;
RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Communications support under the project would underpin other project activities, and&#13;
fulfil the following objectives:&#13;
(a)   to promote access to information and enhance collective knowledge related to&#13;
project objectives, approaches and methods, in order to give meaning to the&#13;
participatory principles of the project;&#13;
(b)   to assist in the process of attitudinal change at all levels, particularly to sensitize&#13;
people to gender and participation issues;&#13;
(c)   to promote the sharing of experiences among Self Help Groups (SHGs) to&#13;
strenigthen their abilities to carry out the project effectively;&#13;
(d)   to ensure res ponsiveness of the project to the changing needs of SHG members&#13;
facilitate communication between SHGs and intervenors;&#13;
(e)   to enhance SHGs' interactions with their communities to ensure harmonious&#13;
relations, resolve conflicts and facilitate collective action to access social programs&#13;
and create community assets;&#13;
(f)   to provide support material and follow-up to training activities;&#13;
(g)   to promote exposure fo SHG members to alternative income generating activities,&#13;
an appreciation of markets, and ways of forming linkages with markets; and&#13;
(h)   to disseminate information about project implementation across participating states,&#13;
as well as more widely to interested national and international agencies.&#13;
Communications Strategy&#13;
2.    Four broad approaches are proposed for the communications strategy:&#13;
(a)   increasing awareness among the target communities, including tribal groups,, of the&#13;
project's concepts and approaches, and services to be provided by the project;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-210-&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
(b)   sensitizing the staff of the WDCs, NGOs, lending institutions, line departments and&#13;
technical resource agencies to gender and participation issues, to enhance the&#13;
relevance and quality of services provided;&#13;
(c)   improving the target group's knowledge of financial, income generating and social&#13;
support services, and of their rights, and promoting the services in a manner that&#13;
increases the target group's willingness to utilize them and, where possible, to share&#13;
in the costs of service delivery; and&#13;
(d)   propagating information about the project to the wide range of project entities and&#13;
other interested agencies.&#13;
The communications strategy would take into account the different phases of project&#13;
implementation, and the specific situations of each project state (or area), particularly those related&#13;
to gender, tribal, poverty, and infrastructure development issues.&#13;
3.    The development of the communications strategy would be based on:&#13;
identification of specific target groups ("segments");&#13;
selection of messages; and&#13;
selection of media.&#13;
(a).   Target Groups. The broad target groups for communications activities would&#13;
include:&#13;
members of the SHGs, the priority target group, who would need information to&#13;
facilitate initiation of and participation in project activities, and to help them&#13;
improve access to and utilization of financial, technical and social services;&#13;
target communities, both women and men, who would need to be made aware of the&#13;
project, sensitized to gender and poverty issues, and motivated to participate in or&#13;
support the project;&#13;
WDC staff who would need to be sensitized to gender and social issues, and kept&#13;
closely in touch with the experiences of SHGs and communities while the project is&#13;
in progress; they are key intervenors who would also be instrumental in spreading&#13;
information about the project more widely;&#13;
NGO staff, who would need to learn about the functioning of support agencies such&#13;
as lending institutions and line departments, in order to work closely with htem in&#13;
project implementation; and who would be key providers of information both to and&#13;
from SHGs and communities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-211-&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
staff of the lending institutions, line departments and other technical resource&#13;
agencies, who would need to be sensitized to the concerns and priorities of SHG&#13;
members and communities, and to learn about project implementation while in&#13;
process; and&#13;
project entities in other participating states and the Centre, and other national and&#13;
international agencies who would benefit from learning of project experiences and&#13;
would share other relevant information with project managers, thereby encouraging&#13;
and supporting the project.&#13;
(b).   Messages. The contents of the messages communicated would reflect the specific&#13;
phase of the project and local/target group considerations. Special attention would&#13;
be paid to tribal communities, given the socio-cultural, linguistic, livelihood and&#13;
infrastructural circumstances of these groups. The messages would focus on the&#13;
major project approaches and components, namely:&#13;
* the SHG concept, group functioning, participatory processes and democratic&#13;
decision making, community interaction and collective action for&#13;
development;&#13;
* gender sensitization and women's legal rights;&#13;
* savings, credit rotation and accessing credit from lending institutions;&#13;
* income generating activities, including promoting awareness of economic&#13;
activities, entrepreneurship development, and providing technical information&#13;
on agriculture, animal husbandry, appropriate technology, resource&#13;
management and environmental issues; and&#13;
* availability and use of social services, including health, education/literacy,&#13;
family welfare, nutrition, water supply and sanitation.&#13;
(c).   Media. A variety of media would be used to accomplish the objectives of the&#13;
communications strategy, with a stress on participatory and interactive approaches&#13;
such as melas, demonstrations, plays, and puppet shows. Films, video- and audio-&#13;
tapes, booklets, pamphlets and newsletters would also be used. Existing&#13;
communications resources which could be utilised in the project would be&#13;
identified and compiled into a communications inventory described in para 7(a)&#13;
below. These would be evaluated for their suitability and new materials&#13;
commissioned to supplement them as needed to ensure that the project's&#13;
objectives, target groups and messages would be covered.&#13;
Communications Activities at the State Level&#13;
4.    To facilitate the implementation of communications activities, the WDCs would take the&#13;
following steps:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-212-&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
(a)   Preparation of an inventory of communications resources: In each state, the&#13;
WDCs would identify locally available communications materials and&#13;
communications agencies, including NGOs, involved in the development and&#13;
dissemination of relevant materials. The inventory would include: information on&#13;
the previous experience of the resource agencies in working with target groups&#13;
similar to those involved in the project; a profile of materials developed by the&#13;
agencies in the areas identified in para. 5 above; and the costs, by agency, for&#13;
available materials and for developing and pre-testing new materials. It would&#13;
also provide an assessment of the capacity of the agency to undertake/participate&#13;
in the communications activities for the project. The terms of reference for the&#13;
inventory of communications resources is attached.&#13;
(b)   Appointment of a Communications Officer: WDCs would identify and appoint a&#13;
Communications Officer at the state level to assist in planning and coordinating&#13;
the implementation of the communications strategy.&#13;
(c)   Preparation of a Communications Plan: Following an initial assessment of the&#13;
communications needs of each community, the WDCs and implementing NGOs&#13;
would draw up a communications plan which would best address the identified&#13;
needs. This plan would be updated periodically in response to the changing needs&#13;
of the project. With the help of the communications inventory, the WDCs and&#13;
implementing NGOs would identify the appropriate agencies to undertake&#13;
communications activities, deciding on approaches, messages, media, scheduling&#13;
and duration in a consultative manner.&#13;
(d)   Newsletter: From the second year onwards, a monthly newsletter would be&#13;
produced in each state by the WDC and distributed to all SHGs, NGOs, line&#13;
departments, lending institutions, technical reource agencies, and the WDCs and&#13;
members of these groups in the other project states. The newsletter would serve to&#13;
disseminate factual information, to provide news of project activities and to&#13;
facilitate exchange of views and experiences. The WDC Communications Officer&#13;
would be responsible for compiling the newsletter based on information received&#13;
from the districts and other relevant sources. The newsletters would form an&#13;
important input for project implementors to understand women's needs and&#13;
priorities and the progress of the project. SHGs would also be encouraged to&#13;
produce simple newsheets to share experiences and knowledge with the&#13;
community - factual information can be extracted from the newsletters. The&#13;
newsheet would be displayed at places in the village where people gather, e.g.,&#13;
school, market, Panchayat building, etc.&#13;
(e)   Monitoring and Evaluation. A system for monitoring the effectiveness of the&#13;
communications activities on an on-going basis would be developed, and the&#13;
feedback from it utilized to better target and improve subsequent communications&#13;
efforts. Conversely, the communications activities would also address, where&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-213-&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
useful, the issues and problems brought to light by the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
of other project activities.&#13;
(f)   Training and the Communications Strategy. The communications strategy would&#13;
supplement and not duplicate training activities. As some areas, such as gender&#13;
sensitization and group formation, are common areas of focus the WDCs would&#13;
identify areas of overlap and develop systems to ensure that the activities under&#13;
each component reinforce each other. The Training and Communications Officers&#13;
in the WDCs would work together for this purpose.&#13;
Training for Communications&#13;
5.    To ensure proper use of the communication materials, project intervenors such as WDC&#13;
staff and NGOs, would be trained in the proper use of audio-visual and other material. They&#13;
would also be trained in how to use various media to advance participation and interactive&#13;
communication, rather than for passive viewing through video presentations, etc. Workshops&#13;
would be held in each district for the field workers of partner NGOs to update their&#13;
communication skills and use of media. The NGO workers would provide training to SHG&#13;
members in the production of materials such as posters and newsheets.&#13;
6.    Communications Equipment. Communications equipment for production and&#13;
dissemination is widely available within India and, hence, to avoid the problems associated with&#13;
owning and maintaining equipment, the project would contract production services and hire&#13;
equipment such as TVs and video recorders, which are available for hire in most large villages.&#13;

2.    The development of the communications strategy entails: (a) identification of specific target&#13;
groups ("segments"); (b) selection of messages; and (c) selection of media. The broad target&#13;
groups identified for communications activities include: (a) members of the SHGs, (b) target&#13;
communities, both women and men; (c) WDC staff, (d) NGO staff, (e) staff of lending&#13;
institutions, line departments and other technical resource agencies, (f) project entities in other&#13;
participating states and the Centre, and (g) other national and international agencies. The messages&#13;
would focus on the major project approaches and components, and would reflect the specific phase&#13;
of the project and local/target group considerations. Special attention would need to be paid to&#13;

Outline of the Tasks to be Carried Out&#13;
3.   In order to facilitate the development of an implementation plan for the communications&#13;
activities, an inventory of communications resources available in the state is to be prepared. This&#13;
inventory should focus on the following:&#13;
(a)   Identification of NGOs and other agencies involved in communications activities&#13;
and in developing and disseminating communications materials.&#13;
(b)   Details of their previous experience of working with target groups similar to those&#13;
involved in the project, for example:&#13;

INDIA&#13;
RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    To coordinate the diverse activities of the project, the monitoring and evaluation system&#13;
would need a computerized project management system, as well as a management information&#13;
system (CPM/MIS). Given the innovative nature of the project, and the need to benefit from&#13;
implementation experience, the CPM/MIS system is essential for effective concurrent monitoring&#13;
and evaluation. In addition, an impact evaluation of the overall project on poverty reduction, as&#13;
well as other socio-economic indicators, must be carried out to assess whether such programs&#13;
have desirable impacts both at the participant level and the society level. The main objective is&#13;
to assess the project's self sustainability and cost effectiveness as well as evaluate it's effects on&#13;
poverty reduction and empowerment. In particular the M&amp;E will:&#13;
* Assess the group sustainability, financial viability, outreach, and institutional viability&#13;
of the program.&#13;
*  Provide feed-back to relevant project affiliates that is based on process monitoring&#13;
and evaluation.&#13;
*  Assess via impact evaluations the poverty reduction effects as well as effects on other&#13;
socio-economic indicators of the project.&#13;
2.    Participatory methods would be promoted so that SHG members are assisted to assess&#13;
their own progress in tracking the impacts of their own actions in the family and community.&#13;
Sponsoring NGOs would facilitate the SHGs in these processes. In addition, a household survey&#13;
will be administered on a sample of households to evaluate the above-mentioned impacts of the&#13;
project.&#13;
Conceptual Outline&#13;
3.    Five modules have been proposed to provide guidance on the selection of indicators for&#13;
different components of the project. They provide a guideline for developing the detailed&#13;
framework for M&amp;E of the project.&#13;
4.    Module 1: Group Formation, Activities and Outreach. The objective of this module&#13;
is to assess formation of stable, viable and self-reliant SHGs. This includes measures of group&#13;
dynamics such as internal cohesion and homogeneity, equity and savings and loans behavior.&#13;
Other qualitative indicators such as relationship among members, group functioning, rotation of&#13;
leadership, etc., would also be measured.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-218-&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
5.    Module 2: Financial Sustainability. Achieving financial sustainability is important to&#13;
demonstrate the program's independence from donor funds for its activities. The CPM/MIS&#13;
would track the progress made towards financial sustainability. Essentially, the system would&#13;
continuously track the income and expenses of the program at the group, cluster/NGO level, and&#13;
check whether they are moving towards balancing each other. There are several indicators that&#13;
provide useful information on the bottleneck(s) towards achieving financial sustainability. All&#13;
indicators must be evaluated at the group level. They may also be evaluated at the&#13;
cluster/federation level should financial links evolve for clusters/federations.&#13;
6.    Indicators for this module would include measures of savings and loan process, income&#13;
and expenses and other variables. Estimates would also be generated of portfolio at risk rate,&#13;
loan loss rate, operating costs as a percent of portfolio, total costs as a percent of portfolio,&#13;
average loan size/cost per loan, percent of loans with past due amounts, amount of liquid funds&#13;
as a percent of loan portfolio, and trends in distribution of loan use. In addition, growth&#13;
indicators for tracking progress would be measured. Most of the information pertaining to&#13;
savings, loans, repayment, and interest rates in this module would be gathered from the account&#13;
books of individual members in the group which would be aggregated for the group in a ledger&#13;
book. This aggregation would be facilitated by NGOs initially, and as the groups mature, the&#13;
leaders of the groups would take over the task. The expenses and costs figures would be kept by&#13;
the NGOs and frequently updated to reflect accurate information. Processing of information at&#13;
the group level would also be facilitated, so that groups would be able to assess their progress&#13;
and understand and act on the components that are not performing as desired.&#13;
7.    Module 3: Institutional Viability. The objective of this module is to assess the&#13;
institutional viability of the program at all levels, i.e., groups, clusters, local NGOs, district level&#13;
organizations, state WDCs, credit and financial institutions. Indicators would include measures&#13;
of group level effectiveness, NGO staff productivity, institutional efficiency (district and state&#13;
level) and institutional durability.&#13;
8.    Module 4: Empowerment. Choice of variables for this module would be participatory&#13;
in order that the measures and indicators reflect the client/group members' perceptions of&#13;
empowerment. The baseline survey would include these measures to facilitate assessment of&#13;
changes that may have occurred due to project participation. A few key variables for assessment&#13;
of empowerment are suggested for evaluation vis-a-vis self, family and community. These&#13;
include self-related variables and social family/community variables. The information on the&#13;
above variables would be collected via in-depth interviews. Participatory methods of self-&#13;
assessment are very important for the groups since this will enable their process of&#13;
empowerment. Since self-help groups inculcate positive development values like self-respect&#13;
and dignity, these types of impacts are also best captured in detailed case analyses.&#13;
9.    Module 5: Impact Assessment. Client, household and intra-household impact of project&#13;
participation would be evaluated based on household surveys of targeted samples. A household&#13;
survey questionnaire would be developed to capture baseline information, as well as follow-up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-219-&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
surveys on all key variables to assess household and intra-household impacts in consumption and&#13;
production and the poverty reduction effects of the program. A few key variables would be,&#13;
among others, patterns of income spending on food, clothing, housing, health, etc., by the client&#13;
on herself and her family; asset accumulation; income growth; access to factors of production;&#13;
and time use profiles. Since impact is assessed by looking at changes before and after project&#13;
experience, care would be taken to control for factors outside the purview of this project that&#13;
could influence these measures. Participatory impact assessments, utilizing suitable&#13;
methodologies, would also measure these impacts. The results of the qualitative and quantitative&#13;
impact assessments would be combined to provide a holistic picture of project impacts on the&#13;
target population.&#13;
Organizational Structure for M&amp;E&#13;
10.   The development of a comprehensive framework for M&amp;E (concurrent and impact) as&#13;
well as the design of the CPM/MIS will be undertaken by a lead team composed of individuals&#13;
with expertise in participatory methods, computer and information technology, statistical&#13;
methods and rural development economics. In addition, the lead agency is strongly encouraged&#13;
to hire expert consultants for specific components of the monitoring and evaluation tasks for&#13;
which in-house capabilities may be insufficient, i.e., for the design and development of the&#13;
CPA/MIS system as well as assessing alternative participatory methods of data collection and&#13;
analysis. The main objective of the lead team (TOR attached) would be to develop a detailed&#13;
framework for project M&amp;E, using as a guideline the conceptual outline and preliminary set of&#13;
indicators that were finalized at the workshop on July 5 1996. The task is two-fold:&#13;
*  To establish a framework for concurrent monitoring and evaluation to assess program&#13;
implementation, performance and sustainability. This component is critical to&#13;
facilitate timely identification and feedback of program constraints and bottlenecks to&#13;
ensure timely and effective responses. To this end, a framework for computerized&#13;
MIS would be developed.&#13;
*  A framework for studying the impact evaluation would be developed to assess the&#13;
poverty reduction and other socio-economic impacts of the project. A sound&#13;
methodological framework would be necessary since program participation is self-&#13;
selective and program placement is context specific. Special household survey design&#13;
may be required to estimate both program placement and participation impacts.&#13;
11.   The design of the M&amp;E framework, including the identification of appropriate indicators&#13;
by the lead team, will be subject to review by World Bank/IFAD at critical points in its&#13;
development giving the opportunity to ensure that the system design and list of indicators does&#13;
not become too complex and unwieldy. The M&amp;E framework developed by the lead team will&#13;
be followed by six independent state agencies who will conduct the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
for the project in each state.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-220-&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
* It will be the lead team's responsibility to ensure that there is consistency of the&#13;
programs indicators across states. This will be facilitated by the lead agency in an&#13;
inter-state workshop with agencies from all six states before project launch.&#13;
* The lead agency would also install the CPM/MIS system in all six state agencies and&#13;
train the staff in implementation of the system for smooth operation. This also&#13;
includes fine-tuning of the system for the specific needs in each state.&#13;
* The lead agency would continue to review on a six-monthly basis, the evaluation&#13;
reports of the six agencies to enable inter-state comparisons of project performance as&#13;
well as ensure consistency of measurement of the various indicators.&#13;
* The lead agency would also be responsible for the impact evaluation of the poverty&#13;
reduction effects of the program as well as assessment of other socio-economic&#13;
indicators of development. This will be based on household survey.&#13;
12.   State Agencies for M&amp;E. Each state would hire a state agency to implement the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation for the state (TOR attached). The CPM/MIS developed by the lead&#13;
team would be installed in each state agency and the relevant staff in each agency would be&#13;
trained and assisted by the lead team until such time as they are able to manage the CPM/MIS&#13;
independently. Each state agency would carry out the concurrent monitoring ad evaluation, track&#13;
progress, and provide timely feedback to all project affiliates (group members/leader, NGOs, and&#13;
WDCs).&#13;

Terms of Reference for the Lead Team for Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
1.    Background: The World Bank and IFAD have entered into an agreement to jointly&#13;
finance the proposed Rural Women's Development and Empowerment Project which will cover&#13;
six states viz. Bihar, Gujerat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. The&#13;
overall objective of the project would be to launch a program which strengthens processes to&#13;
promote economic development of women and to create an environment for social change to&#13;
improve their quality of life. To coordinate the diverse activities of the project, the monitoring&#13;
and evaluation system would need a computerized project management system, as well as a&#13;
management information system (CPM-MIS). Given the innovative nature of the project, and&#13;
the need to benefit from implementation experience, the CPM/ MIS system is essential for&#13;
effective concurrent monitoring and evaluation. In addition, an impact evaluation of the overall&#13;
project on poverty reduction as well as other socio-economic indicators must be carried out to&#13;
assess whether such programs have desirable impacts both at the participant level and the society&#13;
level.&#13;
2.    The main objective of the lead team should be to develop a detailed framework for the&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) of the project, using as a guideline, the conceptual outline&#13;
and preliminary set of indicators that were discussed at the workshop on July 5 1996. The task is&#13;
two-fold:&#13;
A) To establish a framework for concurrent monitoring and evaluation to assess program&#13;
implementation, performance and sustainability. This component is critical to facilitate timely&#13;
identification and feedback of program constraints and bottlenecks to ensure timely and effective&#13;
responses. To this end, a framework for computerized MIS must be developed.&#13;
B) A framework for studying the impact evaluation must be developed to assess the poverty&#13;
reduction and other socio-economic impacts of the project. A sound methodological framework&#13;
must be provided since program placement is context specific and program participation is self&#13;
selective. Special household survey design may be required to estimate both program placement&#13;
and participation impacts.&#13;
Specific needs for concurrent Monitoring and Evaluation (Task A)&#13;
* Define a list of indicators and variables for process monitoring which are consistent with the&#13;
program objectives and reflect the different stages of project implementation. These are typically&#13;
information on operating costs, loan disbursements, savings, training and other costs as well as&#13;
information pertaining to group formation and dynamics including different dimensions of group&#13;
functioning, i.e., practice of SHGs, participation in meetings, problem solving abilities,&#13;
leadership etc.&#13;
* Define the methodology as well as tools to measure each indicator which include a combination&#13;
of participatory methods as well as household surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-222-&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
* Participatory methods must evolve so that the participants themselves become not just providers&#13;
of data. They would also be the analysts who assess their progress in group functioning, track&#13;
the impacts of their own actions in the group and community and revise their strategies&#13;
accordingly. Ideally, the data should be analyzed at each level (individual members, group,&#13;
cluster/area NGO) and the aggregated indicators passed on to the next level and so on. The&#13;
information would finally be synthesized to reflect overall progress and performance of the&#13;
program.&#13;
* Define the methodology to track progress and provide feedback to facilitate project&#13;
implementation and performance.&#13;
3.    These three components will be useful for developing a framework for the design of a&#13;
computerized project management (CPM) and Management Information Systems (MIS) for&#13;
concurrent monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
Specific Needs for Impact Evaluation (Task B)&#13;
* Specify survey methodology&#13;
Specific needs:&#13;
-     Selection of survey villages within the influence of the program&#13;
-     Selection of control villages where program does not exist&#13;
-     Census of villages selected for some aggregate indicators and household&#13;
information to facilitate household selection for in-depth interviews&#13;
-     Benchmark and follow up surveys will use same household and same villages&#13;
* Define possible impacts to be evaluated and indicators to be used to evaluate these impacts&#13;
* Define clearly the methodology and tools for each indicator.&#13;
* Define methods of data collection, and the analytical procedures that will be used to derive&#13;
findings on the impacts of all program interventions for poverty reduction and program&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
* Define i) recommended sample framework and size of stratified samples to ensure that program&#13;
impacts on different segments of the population and community as a whole are statistically&#13;
meaningful; (Pay attention to the fact that there may be some decay of original sample between&#13;
successful surveys) ii) procedures for use of "control" households and villages to isolate the&#13;
impacts of alternate poverty reduction programs from other interventions that have taken place in&#13;
these villages over the time frame of the project.&#13;
Task B may be achieved both via participatory methods of evaluation and based on a carefully&#13;
designed household survey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-223-&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
4.    In order to accomplish tasks A and B, the lead agency is strongly encouraged to hire&#13;
expert consultants for specific components of the monitoring and evaluation tasks for which in-&#13;
house capabilities may be insufficient, i.e., for the design and development of the CPA/MIS&#13;
system as well as assessing alternative participatory methods of data collection and analysis.&#13;
5.    The M&amp;E framework developed by the lead team will be followed by six independent&#13;
state agencies who will conduct the monitoring and evaluation for the project in each state.&#13;
*  It will be the lead team's responsibility to ensure that there is consistency of the programs&#13;
indicators across states. This will be facilitated by the lead agency in an inter-state workshop&#13;
with agencies from all six states before project launch.&#13;
*  The lead agency must also install the CPM/MIS system in all six state agencies and train the staff&#13;
in implementation of the system for smooth operation. This also includes fine-tuning of the&#13;
system for the specific needs in each state.&#13;
*  The lead agency will continue to review on a six-monthly basis, the evaluation reports of the six&#13;
agencies to enable inter-state comparisons of project performance as well as ensure consistency&#13;
of measurement of the various indicators. The report should be sent to the CPSU, who will in&#13;
turn, share the report with the World Bank.&#13;
*  The lead agency will also be responsible for the impact evaluation of the poverty reduction&#13;
effects of the program as well as assessment of other socio-economic indicators of development.&#13;
This will be based on household survey. The lead agency will indicate the role of the state&#13;
agencies, if any, for this task.&#13;
Participatory impact assessments will be mainly conducted by the groups, facilitated by field&#13;
officers.&#13;
Stages in the Review Process&#13;
The review process will occur in five stages:&#13;
*  Stage 1: Development of indicators for concurrent evaluation and impact assessment.&#13;
*  Stage 2: Development of the design of CPM/MIS for concuuent M&amp;E.&#13;
*  Stage 3: Organization of inter-state workshops for implementation of M&amp;E in the six states.&#13;
*  Stage 4: Installation and training of CPM/MIS in all state agencies&#13;
*  Stage 5: Implementation of the impact evaluation of the poverty reduction effects of the program&#13;
as well as assessment of other socio-economic indicators of development.&#13;
In addition, the quarterly and six-monthly reviews of the M&amp;E reports by the state&#13;
agencies would be reviewed by the lead agency through inter-state workshops and the findings&#13;
would be reviewed by the funding organizations.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR STATE AGENCY FOR M&amp;E&#13;
1.    Background. The World Bank and IFAD have entered into an agreement to jointly&#13;
finance the proposed Rural Women's Development and Empowerment Project which will cover&#13;
six states viz. Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The&#13;
overall objective of the project would be to launch a program which strengthens processes to&#13;
promote the economic development of women and create an environment for social change to&#13;
improve their quality of life.&#13;
2.    The Lead Team. A lead team/agency would be engaged to develop a comprehensive&#13;
framework for the M&amp;E system under the project, which would be applicable for all states. This&#13;
team would also design and develop a CPM/MIS covering key aspects of project implementation&#13;
and performance to facilitate concurrent monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
3.    The State Team. Each state will hire a state agency to implement the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation for the state.. The CPM/MIS developed by the lead team will be installed in each&#13;
state agency and the relevant staff in each agency will be trained and assisted by the lead team&#13;
until such time as they are able to manage the CPM/MIS independently. Each state agency will&#13;
carry out the concurrent monitoring ad evaluation, track progress, and provide timely feedback to&#13;
all project affiliates (group members/leader, NGOs, and WDCs). .&#13;
Specific tasks of the State Agency&#13;
4.    Before project launch, the state agency would:&#13;
* Identify any additional indicators, as necessary, to evaluate activities within specific&#13;
components of the project for each state.&#13;
* Identify variables for additional indicators and finalize the tools for gathering the data.&#13;
* Ensure consistency of the program indicators selected with other states.&#13;
* Participate in an inter-state workshop, to be organized by the lead team, to facilitate the&#13;
finalization of the activities described above.&#13;
5.    During project launch, Participate in the launch workshops and develop a common&#13;
understanding of the role of the state agencies in the monitoring and e-aluation component of the&#13;
project.&#13;
6.    After project launch, The main source of data for the CPM/MIS would be the group&#13;
members. Initially the group members would be assisted by the NGO to prepare income&#13;
statements, and minutes of the meetings which provide information on all activities of the group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-226-&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Attachment 2&#13;
The NGO would also provide information on operating costs including staff and other training&#13;
costs. However, especially during the initial phase of the project, the state agency would:&#13;
*  Send out representatives to make frequent field visits to obtain independent documentation of&#13;
data necessary for monitoring project implementation and performance. This will also train&#13;
NGOs to format group level data and to input it into the CPM/MIS. In addition to data&#13;
documentation/verification of group level activities, information must also be gathered about&#13;
bottlenecks faced by all project affiliates with respect to linkages with each other and timely&#13;
and efficient response to needs at different stages&#13;
*  Prepare monitoring reports each quarter.&#13;
*  Provide appropriate feedback to all relevant project affiliates based on information generated&#13;
by the CPM/MIS and project implementation aspects and thereby assist WDCs in preparing&#13;
annual action plans. The feedback would focus on evaluation outputs related to tasks to be&#13;
undertaken during the year including timing, manpower and financial resources and&#13;
established milestones.&#13;
*  Track real progress against projected progress based on the monitoring outputs and provide&#13;
timely feedback reports to project affiliates.&#13;
*  Review the annual workplans developed by the implementing agency, and suggest&#13;
modifications to improve performance.&#13;
*  Prepare a monitoring report on implementation every quarter, and discuss it with WDC staff&#13;
and visiting World Bank supervision teams.&#13;
*  Participate in six-monthly inter-state workshops facilitated by the lead team.&#13;
*  Train the WDCs in the operation of CPM/MIS, so that the monitoring role will gradually be&#13;
handed over to them.&#13;
*  The state agencies will also facilitate participatory impact evaluations and assist project&#13;
affiliates, especially group leaders/members to analyze and process the information. This will&#13;
enable participants to track their progress in terms of their own well-being as well as other&#13;
socio-economic indicators of change.&#13;

sizable tribal populations (Bihar, Gujarat, Kamataka and Madhya Pradesh), while two do not have&#13;
any tribal people (Haryana and Uttar Pradesh). Further, some of the project districts have&#13;
significant tribal populations, while others have a very low percentage of tribal people in their total&#13;
populations. Table ...I gives the percentage of each district's rural population which is tribal, and&#13;
highlights those districts in which the total rural population is greater than 25 percent tribal.&#13;

2.    Status of Women. The status of women in tribal societies is generally more equitable than&#13;
that of women in non-tribal communities, as demonstrated by the more favorable sex ratio among&#13;
tribal people: 977 females per 1000 males for tribal India as a whole, compared to 927 females per&#13;
1000 males in the non-tribal population. However, the poverty, isolation of tribal communities, and&#13;
low level of literacy among tribal women contributes to their overall disadvantage. High female&#13;
work participation rates among tribal groups is a reflection of greater equity - but also of the&#13;
greater burden faced by women who are often solely responsible for the well-being of their&#13;
households on account of the out-migration of male members, and may have large households to&#13;
manage including numerous children. Poor access to social services such as child care facilities,&#13;
health care and family planning services, and schooling for children, contribute to this situation.&#13;
3.    Socio-Economic Characteristics. The tribal districts in the project are characterized by&#13;
widely differing socio-economic, cultural and agro-climatic features. Table ...1 shows the&#13;
percentage of females among the tribal populations of each district who were literate at the time of&#13;
the 1981 Census; the percentage of tribal women participating in the labor force; and the percentage&#13;
of all tribal workers (male and female) who were in the primary sector. Although these data are&#13;
based on the 1981 census, they give an indication of the poor status of tribal women in the project&#13;
districts, and permit some inter-district and inter-state comparisons. While the percentage of&#13;
literate females is likely to have increased since 1981 (by about 10 percentage points at most in any&#13;
district), changes in the other two parameters have probably been marginal.&#13;
4.    In general, work participation among tribal communities, and especially among tribal&#13;
women, is higher than among non-tribal counterparts. Among tribal groups, work was traditionally&#13;
related to community ownership of the means of production and so was usually undertaken&#13;
collectively. In most areas, tribal people traditionally did not depend entirely on agriculture but&#13;
engaged also in collection of forest produce, hunting, craft-making, and so on. This also meant that&#13;
tribal workers had a range of skills, such as those for cultivation, animal-skinning, woodwork,&#13;
domestic arts, etc. However, many tribes in the central part of the country (Bihar and Madhya&#13;
Pradesh) have increasingly adopted the culture of non-tribal peasant communities. Dependence on&#13;
agriculture has increased as tribal people have been alienated from forests, and gradual assimilation&#13;
into non-tribal ways of life has eroded the traditional skill base. The project's approach of forming&#13;
women's Self-Help Groups has special significance in these contexts, as working collectively and&#13;
engaging in multiple occupations are integral aspects of tribal culture. The provision of literacy to&#13;
tribal women and improving market linkages for tribal produce are also important to improving the&#13;
quality of tribal people's lives.&#13;
5.    The agro-climatic features of tribal areas in the project districts also vary remarkably. The&#13;
Chotanagpur plateau of south Bihar is characterized by red clay soils upland and fertile lower lands&#13;
and valleys, with an overall low percentage of irrigated land. About 90 percent of people in these&#13;
areas are engaged in agriculture, and about 60 percent of land holdings are under one hectare. Rice&#13;
or maize is the staple crop, vegetable gardening is common, and small animals are an important&#13;
source of cash income, especially for women. Small farmers supplement their income through&#13;
wage labor or selling forest produce, but there are also groups which are largely dependent for their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-231-&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
livelihoods on the collection and sale of minor forest produce. The situation in the tribal district of&#13;
Panchmahals in Gujarat is somewhat the reverse -- greater dependence on forest collection and&#13;
wage labor among the tribals. In some other areas of Gujarat there is an emphasis on craft. In&#13;
Karnataka, tribal people in the project districts are largely engaged as agricultural labor, with some&#13;
involved in sericulture on their own small holdings, and other groups being mainly pastoralists.&#13;
6.    Spatial Distribution. Tribal populations usually live clustered in specific blocks and&#13;
villages. The higher the proportion of tribal people in a district's rural population, the wider spread&#13;
are tribal habitations. For example, in the most highly tribal of the project districts (Ranchi in&#13;
Bihar, Bharuch and Panchmahals in Gujarat, and Betul in Madhya Pradesh), almost all blocks of&#13;
the district have significant proportions of tribal people, though the actual percentages may vary&#13;
widely, as seen in Table .1. A large number of villages in these districts and blocks would have&#13;
tribal residents. On the other hand, districts with lower concentrations (e.g., below 20 percent of&#13;
their total rural populations) have only a few blocks containing significant tribal populations; and&#13;
these people would be living clustered in a few villages. In such situations, the tribal population is&#13;
often quite isolated, living in small villages or hamlets with poor access and with limited and&#13;
eroding resource bases.&#13;
7.    Infrastructure. Areas inhabited by tribal people are less well developed in terms of&#13;
infrastructure such as roads, markets, schools, health centres, and so on. Due to their physical&#13;
isolation and lack of resources, public systems and facilities are usually understaffed and may offer&#13;
virtually no services. As a result, tribal people have less choice of economic activities, lower access&#13;
to technology, lower incomes, and poorer social indicators than the general population. These&#13;
factors have an important bearing on the project, and linkages between project activities will be&#13;
stronger and greater effort will be spent on improving women's access to services in both the&#13;
economic and social spheres. The project proposes to harness the Tribal Sub-Plans (TSP) in each&#13;
state and the resources provided therein to strengthen the necessary linkages. For this purpose, the&#13;
social assessments (see Section II below) have included a review of the local tribal area sub-plans,&#13;
and have been followed by the development of specific action plans for each tribal district.&#13;
8.    Tribal Institutions. Tribal areas are also characterized by the existence of special&#13;
institutions - both traditional and "modern" ones created by the government. In the former&#13;
category are moneylenders who exercise a strong hold over poor tribal families. Legislation has not&#13;
succeeded in curbing some exploitative practices of moneylenders, such as taking over lands or&#13;
bonding labor. Access to public lending institutions is constrained by tribal people's lack of&#13;
awareness of facilities, low educational levels constraining abilities to "negotiate" fornal systems,&#13;
and physical distance from facilities. In addition, tribal people may be doubly exploited by&#13;
unscrupulous traders who charge high prices for goods brought from outside the area, while&#13;
offering very low prices for forest and other produce offered in exchange by the tribal people. The&#13;
project's approaches of encouraging thrift, credit rotation from among women's own savings, and&#13;
improved marketing could help to reduce some of these dependencies and the resultant problems.&#13;
Amongst the "modem" tribal institutions are Tribal (or SC/ST) Cooperative Marketing Federations&#13;
and Large Area Multipurpose Societies (LAMPS) which encompass primary cooperatives and were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-232-&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
specifically established for tribal areas. The main functions of the LAMPS are to provide credit to&#13;
members for agricultural inputs, including fertilizers, and to purchase produce from farmers at fair&#13;
prices on behalf of various apex organizations. In some cases the LAMPS operate PDS centers to&#13;
provide basic commodities to tribal people.&#13;
9.    Tribal Sub Plans. This project goes beyond the approach of the Tribal Sub Plans in some&#13;
significant ways, and builds on institutions which benefit tribal people. A working group set up in&#13;
connection with the preparation of the Eighth Five Year Plan found a lack of impact of TSP&#13;
investments and ascribed this to a lack of attention to the "felt needs" of tribal people. In contrast,&#13;
this project will base its interventions on extensive consultations with tribal people, especially&#13;
women. Through such consultations, and the development of women's capacities to participate&#13;
further in implementation, the project will focus on the expressed needs and preferences of tribal&#13;
women and implement activities which are culturally acceptable to them. In addition, the project&#13;
aims to create sustainable livelihoods through the formation of thrift and credit groups and the&#13;
introduction and/or enhancement of viable income-generating activities, supported by the necessary&#13;
"forward and backward" linkages. Thus, the project is also in tune with several principles espoused&#13;
by the Eighth Plan, which are likely to continue in the Ninth Plan, for the development of tribal&#13;
peoples: decentralized planning, involving people and non-governmental agencies; local&#13;
employment creation; poverty reduction; improving education, health and other social amenities;&#13;
and investment for asset creation.&#13;
It. The Project's Approach to to Planning for Tribal Women&#13;
10.   A Tribal Status Paper and Tribal Development Plans are being prepared for each district in&#13;
the project which has a significant tribal population, and would be ready by negotiations. The&#13;
Tribal Status Paper collates key information on tribal people in the project areas in order to provide&#13;
an analytical base for planning meaningful interventions to improve the economic and social status&#13;
of tribal women. The Tribal Development Plans (TDPs) are aimed at ensuring that tribal women in&#13;
the project areas participate in project activities, that their capacities to do so are developed, and&#13;
that they receive economic and social benefits under the project. The Status Papers and TDPs are&#13;
based on social assessments which have been undertaken to understand first hand the socio-&#13;
economic situation of tribal women and to participatively plan interventions which can be&#13;
implemented within the project framework and are culturally acceptable to them. The assessments&#13;
would:&#13;
a) collate demographic information on the tribal populations of the proposed project&#13;
districts identifying block/village concentrations of tribal people;&#13;
b) compile relevant social and economic data on the main tribal groups from secondary&#13;
sources; focusing attention on the livelihoods, economic roles and work patterns of&#13;
women, their access to major resources, income levels, literacy, health status,&#13;
community organizations and other relevant issues, and analyzing and reporting the&#13;
information in a manner that is useful for project implementation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-233-&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
c) collect information on available infrastructure and government programs which are&#13;
being implemented for tribal people in the project districts, including their coverage and&#13;
effectiveness and resources available under the local Tribal Sub Plans;&#13;
d) collect information from the major NGOs in the project districts on their program&#13;
efforts with tribal people, and on their views of the success or failure of these, the&#13;
priority needs of the tribal population, and the constraints in addressing them;&#13;
e) carry out participatory assessments, including focus group discussions and in-depth&#13;
interviews, with tribal people, especially women, to understand their situations, identify&#13;
their priority needs and preferences for economic and social interventions which can be&#13;
made within the scope of the project, and determine how the project might address&#13;
these; in some instances village case studies will be prepared; and&#13;
f) refine and organize these suggestions into strategies and specific interventions to be&#13;
undertaken to address the key needs of tribal women in the project areas, preparing clear&#13;
action plans for the project.&#13;
11.   The TDPs would identify the specific objectives to be achieved and strategies to be&#13;
followed, the proposed activities, implementation arrangements, and actions to monitor the project&#13;
in tribal areas. They would include a set of matrices on the following:&#13;
* ProjectActivities: listing Project Objectives, Development Actions to be taken under&#13;
the project, and Implementing Agency/agencies; this matrix identifies actions under&#13;
sub-sections on, for example, Group Formation, Thrift and Credit, Production/Income-&#13;
Generation, Social Development, Training, and Coordination;&#13;
*  Organization and Management: giving the Implementing Agency, its Members and&#13;
their Functions; the agencies include SHGs, NGOs, local (tribal) community&#13;
organizations, line departments, and the Women's Development Corporation;&#13;
*  Monitoring and Evaluation: specifying the monitoring Action to be taken, the Agency,&#13;
and how the Action is to be carried out.&#13;
III. Strategies and Interventions for Tribal Women&#13;
12.   From the information gathered on the situations of tribal areas in the project districts, and&#13;
through the project's approach to planning for tribal women, an overall strategy and a number of&#13;
specific interventions have been identified for tribal populations.&#13;
13.   Project Strategy. The overall strategy of the project would be as successful among tribal&#13;
communities as among non-tribal groups. The project's approach of forming women's Self-Help&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-234-&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
Groups, motivating members to save and rotate their savings amongst themselves, obtain first cash&#13;
credit and then term loans from banks, and avail of project provided skills training, inputs and&#13;
linkages, is appropriate to tribal women on account of the poverty and poor resource base of tribal&#13;
areas, and it is supported by favorable cultural norms prevailing among tribal people.&#13;
14.   In the context of the approach of this project, that of forming village-level Self-Help Groups&#13;
through the intermediation of NGOs, the spatial distribution of tribal people has particular&#13;
significance. First, to overcome the physical isolation of tribal people and penetrate prevailing&#13;
cultural barriers, it will be necessary to involve NGOs that have experience of working with tribal&#13;
people, preferably in the same areas or at least with the same or similar tribal groups, and/or NGOs&#13;
who are willing to work amongst these groups. NGOs working in districts such as Ranchi (Bihar)&#13;
or Panchmahals (Gujarat) which are highly tribal are likely to have the capability to work with&#13;
tribal people. In other districts, such as Hoshangabad or Dewas (Madhya Pradesh) or the four&#13;
project districts in Kamataka, there may be some NGOs with relevant experience, and others&#13;
without. In these cases, judicious selection of NGOs will be called for in order to ensure that the&#13;
project reaches some tribal women.&#13;
15.   Second, an understanding of the livelihood patterns (including occupations, resource base,&#13;
income, and migratory habits) of the tribal people in each district (or sub-district area) is critical to&#13;
planning project activities - thrift and credit, income generation, as well as social development - in&#13;
ways which are economically and culturally relevant to the tribal group. However, the poorer&#13;
infrastructure and difficult conditions of tribal areas suggest that more intensive efforts will be&#13;
required to achieve effective results. In this regard, the selection of strong, hard-working NGOs is&#13;
critical. Through their intermediation between the tribal communities and mainstream institutions,&#13;
such as banks and line departments, to ensure the provision of improved services, some major&#13;
constraints faced by tribal people could be removed, or at least reduced. Furthermore, the approach&#13;
of the project to provide group members functional literacy and communities with assets, basic&#13;
health care and child care could fill major gaps that persist in social services in tribal areas.&#13;
16.   Specific Interventions. Among specific interventions, the following have been identified&#13;
as most likely to be implemented among tribal communities in the project:&#13;
*  Functional literacy for all group members, on account of the low levels of literacy&#13;
prevailing among tribal women&#13;
*  Consolidation of water resources through group and individual action to improve&#13;
drinking water supplies as well as soil moisture for land-based activities; creation of&#13;
drinking water facilities for communities and education on maintaining clean water&#13;
sources, because tribal areas usually have either extreme water scarcity or shallow&#13;
sources of water&#13;
*  Enhancing productivity of homestead land for own consumption and market production,&#13;
through soil improvement, diversification of crops (vegetables, legumes, fruit trees) and&#13;
improved cropping practices, building on land availability and ownership in tribal areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-235-&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
*  Improving small animal rearing and management as a primary or secondary income-&#13;
generating activity&#13;
*  Enhancing home-based processing of agricultural and forest products&#13;
*  Improving designs, product quality, and productive efficiency among craftspersons and&#13;
artisans, along with better marketing of craft products&#13;
*  Basic health care training, because the gap in health services in tribal areas is large;&#13;
elements of traditional health care would be introduced by involving specialized NGOs&#13;
who have developed capability in this field&#13;
*  Community organized 'mini' child care centres, particularly where tribal women work&#13;
at some distance from homes or live in secluded hamlets; these may be needed even in&#13;
areas where ICDS is operational because of the low coverage afforded by ICDS.&#13;
17.   Monitoring and Evaluation. Baseline surveys conducted before project launch will&#13;
capture relevant information on the characteristics of tribal women involved in the project. The&#13;
M&amp;E component of the project would be appropriately designed to reflect any specific project&#13;
inputs in tribal areas which result from the assessments of tribal women's status and Tribal&#13;
Development Plans. In districts where SHGs consist mainly of tribal women, the M&amp;E component&#13;
would compare the progress of tribal groups to that of other groups, and suitably modify project&#13;
inputs, if necessary.&#13;

1.     Overall Strategy. Given the innovative nature and decentralized management structure&#13;
of the project, strong emphasis would be placed on learning from implementation experience on&#13;
an on-going basis to assist problem solving and adjust project design/implementation&#13;
approaches as necessary. The main source of information for this purpose would be the&#13;
concurrent M&amp;E system, and implementation reviews, progress reports and studies on economic,&#13;
social, financial and institutional aspects of the project. This annex consists of: Part A, a set of&#13;
detailed implementation charts, covering each phase of project/SHG development; and Part B: a&#13;

B. PROJECT SUPERVISION&#13;
3.      Supervision Strategy. The project is by nature complex and will require intensive&#13;
management, monitoring and supervision. The creation of monitoring and evaluation capability&#13;
within the normal functions of project management in the center as well in the states would be an&#13;
important management tool to facilitate successful implementation. To coordinate the diverse&#13;
activities of the project, the monitoring and evaluation system would include a computerized&#13;
project management system, as well as a management information system (CPM-MIS) to fully&#13;
benefit from implementation experience, and to enable effective planning, monitoring and&#13;
supervision. (See Annex 14 for more information on the proposed M&amp;E system for the project).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-242-&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
Other important inputs towards supervision of the project would include: the use of development&#13;
indicators; a system of quarterly and annual reports; planning/review workshops at the national,&#13;
state and district levels; annual action plans and budgets; special reports /studies on specific&#13;
activities; and a mid-term review. Complimentary use of these inputs with mandatory&#13;
supervision wok would be the key element of the proposed supervision strategy.&#13;
4.    Supervision Plans and Responsibilities. Given the decentralized nature and multi-state&#13;
structure of the project, responsibility for supervising the project would be shared between a&#13;
number of agencies. Each agency with supervision responsibility would first prepare its own&#13;
plan highlighting areas of responsibilities/focus. These plans would then be used to develop an&#13;
overall annual plan to maximize coordination and synergy. The main agencies involved in&#13;
supervision work would include:&#13;
(a)   Central Project Support Unit (CPSU). The CPSU would monitor project's&#13;
progress and participate in the supervision work with a special emphasis on&#13;
overseeing proposed actions for strengthening of implementation capacity of&#13;
WDCs. More specifically CPSU would supervise:: (a) activities to build the&#13;
capacities of project implementors, (b) information exchange amongst the state&#13;
WDCs and other implementing agencies, and between them and other national&#13;
and international agencies with relevant expertise and experience; and (c)&#13;
coordinate monitoring and evaluation activities. To facilitate information&#13;
exchange across states, the CPSU would propose and organize fora for&#13;
information sharing. The CPSU would also commission special&#13;
studies/consultancies to analyze the progress of specific aspects of the project and&#13;
share this information with the participating agencies as well as use the findings&#13;
as inputs to its own (and IDA's) supervision work;&#13;
(b)   State Women's Development Corporations (WDC). The state WDCs would be&#13;
responsible for promoting the project concept, for engaging NGOs to implement&#13;
the project at the field level, and for guiding and monitoring them, and for overall&#13;
coordination and supervision of project implementation in the state. The WDCs&#13;
would be responsible for preparing annual and quarterly action plans and budgets,&#13;
quarterly and annual progress reports, and reimbursement claims for submission&#13;
to the CPSU/DWCD. For this work they would seek assistance from consultants,&#13;
especially to assess NGOs' training activities, and activities related to credit and&#13;
finance. The WDCs would interact with the CPSU to indicate their specific needs&#13;
by way of special studies to be initiated by the center. Feedback from the M&amp;E&#13;
system would guide the focus of the supervision work on an on-going basis;&#13;
(c)   Other Agencies. Project supervision would benefit from the input provided by&#13;
participating NGOs. While operating as the key agencies forming SHGs and&#13;
interacting with communities at the grassroots levels, NGOs would assist in&#13;
supervision by providing timely feedback to WDCs on the performance of SHGs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-243-&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
in project activities, and on the views of SHG members. In addition, the project's&#13;
supervision work would benefit from close interaction between DWCD, IDA,&#13;
IFAD and the Inter-Agency Working Group (IAWG) on Gender and&#13;
Development, which meets in Delhi regularly and includes representatives of UN,&#13;
multilateral and bilateral agencies. Some of the activities considered by the&#13;
IAWG in support of project supervision include: (a) establishment of an advisory&#13;
or resource group for periodic sharing of experiences; (b) involvement in&#13;
monitoring and evaluating the project; and (c) advocacy and policy dialogue with&#13;
GOI on the basis of "lessons learned" from the project. DWCD and WDCs would&#13;
be encouraged to liaise closely with inmplementors of bilateral women's projects&#13;
to ensure exchange of information and experiences. In addition, wherever&#13;
appropriate, representatives from bilateral agencies with relevant experience&#13;
would be invited to participate in IDA supervision missions or undertake&#13;
review/studies on specific subjects of generic interest to all concerned.&#13;
(d)   IDA S3peiiqon. The core of IDA's supervision work would be the six-monthly&#13;
supervision missions. IDA would also have the responsibility to supervise the&#13;
project on behalf of IFAD but representative would join mission at regular&#13;
intervals. Important inputs for IDA missions would be the quarterly and annual&#13;
progress reports to be produced by WDCs and annual synthesis report on the&#13;
overall progress of the project to be produced by CPSU. Annex 16, Attachment I&#13;
provides a provisional plan for IDA's supervision work. The key elements of this&#13;
plan would be:&#13;
(i)    Mission Frequency. Bank supervision missions will visit the project&#13;
approximately every six months. If the project is launched in March 1997,&#13;
the first supervision mission following project launch workshop would be&#13;
around September 1997. However, due to the innovative nature of the&#13;
project, during the initial two years of the project it is anticipated that&#13;
during the initial years additional short missions would be required to&#13;
facilitate implementation and adoption of IDA's guidelines for&#13;
procurement, disbursement and reporting.&#13;
(ii)   Composition of the Mission. The missions will be lead by the Bank Task&#13;
Manager, and will include, as appropriate at the time, specialists in&#13;
institutional development, M&amp;E, training, communications, social,&#13;
economic, financial, and procurement issues. Annex 16 Attachment 2&#13;
provides an estimated IDA supervision input over the duration of the&#13;
project. This attachment also lists the requirements taken n to account in&#13;
developing this list.&#13;
(iii)  Project Activities linked with Missions. During one of the supervision&#13;
missions each year, a workshop will be held with all key project&#13;
implementation agencies to review project progress in a participatory&#13;
manner. The supervision mission will be informed by discussions of&#13;
experience on the ground, constraints encountered, and needs expressed by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-244-&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
the project stakeholders for project redesign. These annual workshops&#13;
may also be linked with the annual work plans and budgets prepared by&#13;
the WDCs and CPSU.&#13;
Part C: Reporting and Reviews&#13;
3.    Reporting. The main building blocks for the reporting system of the project would be the&#13;
quarterly and annual progress reports to be produced by WDCs and CPSU with the help of their&#13;
respective M&amp;E agencies. The annual report on the overall progress of the project to be&#13;
produced by CPSU would synthesize the findings of the reports submitted by the states and draw&#13;
lessons as appropriate for sharing with the main implementing agencies. The proposed Table of&#13;
Contents of the progress reports is given in Annex 16, Attachment I, which would finalized in&#13;
discussion with the implementing agencies. The proposed structure of the reports allows the&#13;
implementing agencies to provide: (i) an overview of progress and status of performance&#13;
indicators; (ii) information on the progress by category of expenditures; (iii) information on&#13;
project expenditure in relation to budget for each quarter and fiscal year; (iv) information on the&#13;
financial management; and (v) information on compliance with project's legal covenants.&#13;
4.    The Mid-Term Review. Approximately halfway through the project period a mid-term&#13;
review of the project progress would be carried out jointly by GOI and IDA. The CPSU and all&#13;
implementing agencies in the participating states, would submit progress reports to IDA for this&#13;
review. Thus, if the project is launched in early 1997, this would be approximately in September&#13;
1999. The principal aim of the mid-term review would be to determine whether there are any&#13;
major issues or problems in the project which necessitate rethinking the original project design&#13;
and making mid-course corrections. Feedback from the CPM/MIS will be utilized in this&#13;
process. It may also be used for a preliminary impact assessment of the project. A mid-term&#13;
review report will be submitted to IDA and discussed with the subsequent supervision mission.&#13;
It would highlight any major problems, issues, bottlenecks or delays in project execution, and&#13;
discuss the prospects for resolving them and completing the project on time.&#13;

and major items of office equipment where they can be bulked together. This only applies to the&#13;
start-up phase of the project in each state. National Competitive Bidding requires: (i) publication&#13;
of Invitation for Bid (IFB) in newspapers with wide circulation within the country; (ii) use of the&#13;
Bank's standard bidding documents; (iii) sale of bidding documents to start only after publication&#13;
of the IFB; (iv) bidding period 30-60 days from the date of the start of sale of bidding&#13;
documents; and (v) single envelop system for submission of bids.&#13;
2.    The following steps are to be followed: (i) notification/advertising; (ii) issue of bidding&#13;
documents; (iii) submission of bids; (iv) public opening of bids; (v) evaluation of bids; (vi)&#13;
award in favor of lowest evaluated bidder who is determined to be qualified to perform the&#13;
contract satisfactorily; and (vii) no negotiations. The notification/advertisement and evaluation&#13;
of bids report would be reviewed by IDA.&#13;
3.    Prior review would be required for all contracts of US$100, 000 and above and would take&#13;
place at the following stages: (i) invitation to bid; (ii) bidding documents; (iii) bid evaluation&#13;
report; and (iv) final contracts.&#13;
4.    The schedule of the critical steps for national competitive bidding suggests about 34&#13;
weeks would normally be required from preparation of the specifications and bidding documents&#13;
to the delivery date. Accordingly, to ensure that required equipment and goods are on hand to&#13;
start the work program for a fiscal year that begins on April 1, procurement activities should&#13;
normally begin by the preceding August 15.&#13;
National Shopping&#13;
5.    National shopping procedures would be used to procure vehicles, office and other&#13;
equipment, furniture and materials in individual contracts not to exceed US$20, 000. Rate&#13;
contracts of the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals (DGS&amp;D), New Delhi, would&#13;
only be acceptable as a substitute for procurement under national shopping. State rate contracts&#13;
would not be acceptable but may feature as one of the quotations under the standard national&#13;
shopping procedures.&#13;
6.    The essential elements of national shopping are: (i) clear description and quantity of the&#13;
item(s), as well as a specified delivery date; (ii) price quotations obtained from several suppliers,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-250-&#13;
Annex 17&#13;
usually at least three to ensure competitive prices; (iii) evaluation of quotations to follow sound&#13;
public/private sector practices of the purchaser; and (iv) the purchase order placed with the&#13;
lowest evaluated supplier by suitably incorporating the terms of the accepted offer. Further&#13;
negotiations are not permitted after the lowest qualifying quotation has been evaluated.&#13;
7.    All documents associated with the purchase of goods under national shopping procedures&#13;
would be subject to selective post-review by visiting missions. Such reviews would concentrate&#13;
on the procedures used and the competitiveness of prices paid and physical inspections of the&#13;
relevant items.&#13;
8.    The schedule of the critical steps for national shopping suggests about 10 weeks would&#13;
normally be required from the preparation of the initial specifications to the delivery date.&#13;
Accordingly, to ensure that required equipment and goods are on hand to start the work program&#13;
for a fiscal year that begins on April 1, procurement activities should normally begin by the&#13;
preceding January 15.&#13;
Contractual Services Arrangements for Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)&#13;
and Consulting Services&#13;
9.    The project would seek NGO participation in the formation and nurturing of the Self-&#13;
Help Groups and provision of training for many of the project components. The WDCs would&#13;
invite detailed proposals from interested NGOs against a well-defined terms of reference&#13;
outlining the services to be provided. The WDCs would be responsible for reviewing the&#13;
proposals and awarding contracts. As far as possible, competition would be encouraged with a&#13;
number of NGOs invited to submit proposals. The selection of NGOs would be guided by the&#13;
criteria given in Annex 5.&#13;
10.   Consultancy services from private firms/organisations, large NGOs, autonomous&#13;
government agencies would be required for design and implementation of the M&amp;E procedures,&#13;
development of strategy and support structure for the development of non-farm activities, WDC&#13;
management review, and special studies (techno-economic, product specific feasibility studies,&#13;
market studies).&#13;
11.   Both NGOs and consulting services would be procured in accordance with the Guidelines&#13;
on the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers. Prior review is required by IDA for: (i)&#13;
Terms of Reference regardless of value; (ii) all single source selection of consulting firm; (iii) all&#13;
consultant contracts for assignment of a critical nature, regardless of value; and (iv) contracts for&#13;
consultancy services valued at equivalent of US$100,000 and above for consulting firms and&#13;
US$50,000 and above for individuals. For contracts falling within the thresholds, prior review&#13;
would be at the following stages: (i) Terms of Reference; (ii) shortlist: (iii) documents&#13;
containing the Letter of Invitation, Supplementary Information to Consultants and Conditions of&#13;
Contract; (iv) Evaluation Report of the technical proposals; (v) negotiated draft contract (with a&#13;
copy of the winning proposal) before signing of the contract; and (vi) conformed signed copy of&#13;
the final contract required in order to authorise disbursement against the contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-251-&#13;
Annex 17&#13;
12.   The schedule of critical steps for employment of small NGOs suggests about 14 weeks&#13;
would be required from the preparation of the initial terms of reference (TORs) until the key staff&#13;
are in post. Accordingly, in order to ensure that required services are on hand to start the work&#13;
prograrn for a fiscal year that begins on April 1, recruitment activities should begin by the&#13;
preceding December 15.&#13;
Contractual Services Arrangements for Individuals&#13;
13.   The project will require the services of a large number of individuals to provide a wide&#13;
range of support functions to project activities including design, technology and market linkage&#13;
assistance to women producers. Procedures for the employment of individuals are usually less&#13;
formal. IDA only requires prior approval of terms of reference and the qualifications and&#13;
conditions of employment before an agreement (or contract) is negotiated and signed. In such&#13;
cases, the major concern will be that the individual is suitably experienced and capable.&#13;
Community Construction&#13;
14.  In some instances the community itself may wish to undertake the construction of&#13;
community assets, such as gravity drinking water supply schemes, community halls, or sanitation&#13;
with appropriate technical guidance and supervision. Only simple constructions would be&#13;
suitable for this approach. The community would enter into a contract with the project authorities&#13;
to implement the works. The community would be required to constitute a Management&#13;
Committee with designated representatives (authorised to operate the bank account) and open an&#13;
account in the name of the Community for the sole purpose of the construction scheme. The&#13;
community would contract the design and preparation of construction drawings, specifications&#13;
and bill of quantities (to be approved by the relevant district technical officers) or these would be&#13;
made available by the district departments. The community would submit an estimated cost of&#13;
the works with a breakdown into labor and materials; name of the engineer who would be&#13;
responsible for technical supervision of construction; documentation of clear title to use the land&#13;
in the proposed manner and details of the recording and accounting system to be used to ensure&#13;
accountability for the funds. The contract agreement would stipulate details of stage payments.&#13;
An advance amount would be paid into the community account to enable materials to be&#13;
procured. Work would be inspected by the relevant district department prior to release of stage&#13;
payments.&#13;

RURAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Financial Analysis&#13;
1.    The resource base in the project areas would enable a wide range of income generating&#13;
activities to be undertaken by the women. Since the women will be responsible for selecting&#13;
activities which are appropriate to their circumstances, only an indication of the activities likely&#13;
to feature in the lending program can be given. Financial models for a range of on-farm and non-&#13;
farmn activities have been prepared and are presented in Tables I to 23 for on-farm activities&#13;
covering crop production (paddy, wheat, sorghum, pulses, sunflower and chillies); horticulture&#13;
(vegetable production, banana, annual flowers, vegetable seedling production and fruit tree&#13;
nursery); livestock (goat rearing, kid and lamb fattening) and a range of production, trade and&#13;
services non-farm activities. The physical and financial parameters used in the models will vary&#13;
across the participating states and hence the financial models can only give a broad indication of&#13;
the expected financial returns. Many of the crop production activities represent up-grading of&#13;
existing technology through the use of improved varieties and higher amounts of fertilizer. The&#13;
horticulture activities represent ways of increasing the returns to small areas of land through&#13;
focusing on high value crops which women are ideally suited to manage. Small livestock&#13;
activities would be undertaken in small units (e.g. 3 lambs or 5 kids) as supplementary income&#13;
earning activities. Non-farm activities selected mainly represent low investment, high turnover&#13;
trading and service activities.&#13;
2.    The results of the financial analysis of these activities are summarized in Table 24 in&#13;
terms of incremental net income, return per manday and incremental benefit: cost ratio.&#13;
Incremental net incomes are variable as they cover both supplementary and full-time activities&#13;
but generally exceed Rs. 4,000 per annum. Return per manday is in excess of Rs. 30 with many&#13;
activities yielding returns of between Rs. 50 and 80/day. This compares with the average wage&#13;
for women in agricultural labor of around Rs. 15-20 per day with the exception of Haryana where&#13;
higher rates prevail. The incremental benefit:cost ratios are in excess of 1.5.&#13;
B. Economic Analysis&#13;
Approach&#13;
3.    Given the multi-faceted nature of the project, many of the benefits, particularly those&#13;
relating to social change, cannot readily be quantified. The quantifiable benefits relate to the&#13;
project's objective to increase women's economic independence through access to credit,&#13;
training and other technical support services to increase their involvement in income generating&#13;
activities. Even here, given the flexibility in the credit mechanism and the freedom of choice to&#13;
be exercised by the women in the selection of activities, the economic analysis of the project&#13;
requires more than the usual number of assumptions and therefore a high degree of&#13;
approximation. The major uncertainties concern loan uptake, the proportion of loans used for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-258-&#13;
Annex 18&#13;
social purposes, the mix of activities financed, and the extent to which project loans are replacing&#13;
existing more expensive sources of credit from the informal sector and hence are not generating&#13;
incremental economic benefits.&#13;
4.    Economic prices and costs. Economic import parity prices have been calculated based&#13;
on the World Bank Quarterly Review of Commodity Markets dated August 1996. World market&#13;
prices for internationally traded commodities are based on price projections for the year 2000 in&#13;
constant 1996 prices. Farmgate equivalent import parity prices have been calculated for rice,&#13;
wheat, sorghum, urea, phosphate and potash (Table 25). India is approaching self-sufficiency in&#13;
rice and wheat. However, India's high population growth (2.2% per year), as well as the high&#13;
income elasticity of demand for rice and other cerealsl justifies considering these commodities as&#13;
import substitutes. All other commodities have been considered as non-traded on the&#13;
international market. Their financial prices (at constant June 1996 prices) have been adjusted to&#13;
economic prices using a SCF of 0.9.&#13;
5.    Women in the rural areas are not able to find employment throughout the year and face&#13;
considerable underemployment or unemployment for at least 4 months of the year. This has&#13;
been reflected in the derivation of shadow wage rates for female labour. For seasonal&#13;
agricultural activities, it has been assumed that the requirement for labour coincides with times&#13;
when women are able to find employment and the financial wage rate of INR 20 per day has&#13;
been adjusted by the SCF to derive a shadow wage of INR 18/day. For livestock and non-farm&#13;
activities which are undertaken on a year-round basis, a factor of 0.66 has been applied to the&#13;
financial wage rate, adjusted by the SCF, giving an average shadow rate of female labour of INR&#13;
12/day. Financial and economic prices are summarized in Table 26.&#13;
6.    Methodology To obtain an approximate estimate of the project benefits, a multi-stage&#13;
approach incorporating various assumptions has been used. Firstly, economic models have been&#13;
prepared for a range of 23 typical income generating activities taken up by women covering&#13;
crops, livestock, and non-farm activities. The experience of the lending pattern of some existing&#13;
self-help groups indicates that crop and livestock loans are expected to represent around 85% of&#13;
lending and non-farm activities around 15%. On this basis, a weighted average net incremental&#13;
benefit and net incremental cost over the range of activities was derived. A weighted average&#13;
unit investment requirement was similarly calculated for the representative range of activities&#13;
giving an average unit investment of Rs. 4,100. This was used to derive the number of activities&#13;
which could be financed each year with the funds available for investment. For crop activities, a&#13;
hectare has been used as the unit of investment but women are likely to borrow for smaller areas&#13;
and hence the average loan size would be less.&#13;
7.    A number of assumptions have been used to indicate the volume of lending from the&#13;
groups each year which is likely to generate incremental economic benefits. The assumptions&#13;
used in the base case are as follows: (a) the quantum of bank credit accessed by an SHG&#13;
increases in relation to the equity base of the group and an increasing loan:savings ratio to reach&#13;
around Rs. 100,000 by the fifth year of a group's existence (see Annex 7, Attachment 2); (b) the&#13;
percentage of funds available to the group which are lent out each year increases from 90% to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-259-&#13;
Annex 18&#13;
95% by the fourth year of the group's operations; (c) the average rotation of investment funds is&#13;
initially twice per year when very short term consumption loans dominate the lending program&#13;
(some groups achieve up to four times), but reduces to 1.5 times as more loans are given for&#13;
productive purposes; (d) the percentage of funds lent out which generate incremental economic&#13;
benefits increases from 15% to 40% by the fourth year of operation - analysis of existing SHGs&#13;
indicates that initially the percentage of lending for consumption/social purposes ranges from&#13;
20%-70% but reduces over time whilst in the early stages a high proportion of loans for&#13;
productive purposes replace other more expensive sources of credit; (e) most of the lending&#13;
initially is for short term activities and many activities will initially require repeat loans to&#13;
sustain the activity - it is assumed that on average it will take three years for activities to become&#13;
self-financing;&#13;
8.    All the project costs for support for income generating activities have been included in&#13;
the analysis whilst 50% of the other support costs (capacity building of the SHGs and intervenors&#13;
and project management costs) are assumed to have a direct impact on the involvement of&#13;
women in income generating activities. The costs of the social programs have been excluded.&#13;
Economic costs have been estimated by deducting taxes and multiplying the financial base costs&#13;
plus physical contingencies by the SCF of 0.9.&#13;
Economic Results&#13;
9.    Overall project returns Analysed over ten years, the economic rate of return is&#13;
estimated to be 25% and the NPV at the opportunity cost of capital of 12% is estimated to be Rs.&#13;
319 million (US$ 7.4 million) as shown in Table 27.&#13;
10.   Sensitivity analysis A number of scenarios were tested to establish the economic&#13;
viability of the project. The results are presented below:&#13;
EIRR (%)           NPV&#13;
Rs. million&#13;
Base case                                    25                  335&#13;
Benefits decrease by 10%                      12                 (10)&#13;
Activity costs increase by 10%                15                 70&#13;
Support costs increase by 10%                23                  288&#13;
Max. 50% of funds generate increm econ benefits   26             367&#13;
Max 30% of funds generate increm econ benefits   21              196&#13;
1 year lag in investment activities          19                  100&#13;
11.   Switching values indicate that the project benefits could decrease by 10% for the NPV to&#13;
fall to zero whilst project activity costs could increase by 13%. The percentage of funds&#13;
generating incremental economic benefits could fall to 20%. This indicates that the project is&#13;
more sensitive to the performance of the investment activities financed as these impact&#13;
individually on the cost and benefit streams than to variations in the assumptions on the overall&#13;
pattern of lending which impact on both costs and benefits simultaneously.&#13;

13.   The costs incurred under the project to generate these benefits can be categorised into the&#13;
direct expenditure on capacity building of the SHGs and development of the SHG members and&#13;
the indirect costs of strengthening the participating agencies. The latter would be expected over&#13;
time to benefit a wider clientele than the members of the SHGs formed under the project. The&#13;
indicative breakdown of costs over the life of the project is given below on a per group basis:&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-262-&#13;
Annex 18&#13;
Public Sector Role and Fiscal Impact&#13;
13.   Public Sector and Non-governmental Roles. The project designs allocates substantial&#13;
responsibilities and resources to non-governmental entities and supplies a small amount of&#13;
supplemental resources directly to government in order to build capacity. Of the total project&#13;
costs, about US$ 19 million (36 percent) would flow to the SHGs and US$ 25 million (47%) to&#13;
NGOs, academic institutions and other contracted specialists. Project expenditures flowing to&#13;
government would comprise about US$ 9.0 million (17% of total project costs) for goods, travel,&#13;
salaries of incremental staff and operation and maintenance.&#13;
14.   Cost recovery. Whilst in the initial phase of the program no specific cost recovery&#13;
measures are proposed, it is intended to examine opportunities for partial recovery of the costs of&#13;
some services during project implementation. Experience from on-going NGO programs&#13;
suggests that SHG members are increasingly willing to pay for services which deliver tangible&#13;
benefits. In this context, the project will promote, on a pilot basis, the formation of clusters and&#13;
associations of SHGs. This experiment will test the ability of these bodies to take over many of&#13;
the NGO support services to SHGs and possibly some of the technical support services provided&#13;
under the project, on a self-financing basis.&#13;
15.   Fiscal impact. Given the pilot nature of the project, it represents a very small financial&#13;
burden and the overall impact on the state and/or central government budgets will be negligible.&#13;
All incremental staff would not be additional to the establishment but would be hired on contract&#13;
or would come on deputation from government departments where their posts would be frozen.&#13;
All contracts can be discontinued at the end of the project. The project incorporates a defined&#13;
exit strategy for intervenors. Support to SHGs by NGOs would be limited to four years. By the&#13;
end of the project, the mature SHGs would have taken over the responsibility for managing their&#13;
affairs from the NGOs either on an individual group basis or through the formation of clusters&#13;
and associations of clusters. Phasing of the process of group formation, however, means that&#13;
around 60% of the SHGs may be less than four years old by the end of the project period. Whilst&#13;
some of these may be integrated into clusters and associations for receipt of on-going support,&#13;
others would still require support directly from the NGOs. The total cost of NGO support&#13;
outside of the project period would be around Rs. 28 million (US$ 0.8 million) over three years.&#13;
16.   Sustainability. A major thrust of the project is capacity building of the SHGs so that&#13;
they are capable of managing their own affairs and are able to further their own social and&#13;
economic development by virtue of the awareness and linkages established under the project&#13;
with lending institutions and technical and social support agencies. Most of the SHGs would be&#13;
linked to the banks and the expected high repayment rates and reduction in the banks' transaction&#13;
costs should ensure a continuing flow of credit to the groups. In addition, the formation of&#13;
clusters of SHGs and cluster associations is expected to take place and these, over time, will take&#13;
over many of the support functions hitherto provided by the NGOs whilst also playing a vital&#13;
role in the wider replication of the SHG concept. Building the capacity of mature SHGs to&#13;
promote the formation of additional SHGs not only strengthens the existing groups and furthers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 18&#13;
their sustainability but contributes to a more cost-effective and sustainable approach to the&#13;
formation of SHGs, with an anticipated reduction in direct NGO support costs of almost 50%.&#13;

            The overall objective of the Rural
            Women's Development and Empowerment Project is to
            strengthen processes that promote economic development of
            women and create an environment for social change.  The
            specific objectives are to: a) establish women's
            self-help groups (SHGs); b) sensitize and strengthen the
            institutional capacity of support agencies to proactively
            address women's needs; c) increase the incomes of poor
            women; d) develop linkages between SHGs and lending
            institutions to ensure women's access to credit
            financing; and e) improve access to better health care,
            education and drudgery reduction facilities.  The project
            will pursue its objectives through the following components:
            a) institutional capacity building for women's
            development; b) establish support mechanisms for women
            managed income generating activities; c) establish
            mechanisms to access social programs and leverage funds for
            community assets creation; and d) provide effective project
            management systems.
