THAILAND ALTERS ITS DEVELOPMENT PATH&#13;
Between i988 and 1996, Thailand's economy grew by 7% a yeari and the share of the population in&#13;
poverty droppedfromn 22%  to 11%. But the countiy'sfinancial crisis pushed that share back up to&#13;
/3%  in 1998. In response, Tkailand is redirecting its developmnent strategy to reduice inequality, whick&#13;
remained high despite all the growth.&#13;
The country/s development plan, now more people-centered, has increased resources to the poorer&#13;
north and northeast. The objective: to reduce poverty to less than 10% by 2001. A new social inivest-&#13;
mentffund helps create jobs and supports social servicesfor poor people. As part of the new strategy, gov-&#13;
ernance reforms are geared to increasing accountability and giving authority to local district councils,&#13;
which now elect their own officials and commnandgreater resources.&#13;

SECTION I&#13;
Overview&#13;
I n fiscal zooo, the World Bank took important steps, together with its clients, to pave&#13;
the way for solid progress in the fight against poverty. Every step involved partners, some&#13;
old, some new, many at the country level, some at the global level.&#13;
GLOBAL CONTEXT: RECOVERING ECONOMIES,&#13;
PERSISTENT CHALLENGES&#13;
Economic and financial conditions recovered sharply in 1999 from the trials of the prior two&#13;
years. At an estimated 3.3 percent, world economic growth exceeded expectations, led by a strong&#13;
United States economy and policy reforms in emerging snarket countries. Global trade recovered&#13;
strongly, and commodity prices firmed. These elements will permit more "self-financing" of&#13;
development by countries. The present challenge is to sustain and strengthen this economic&#13;
turnaround. Global Development Finance 2000 suggests that those countries that rely more heavily&#13;
on trade, are more diversified, attract more foreign direct investment, and have become more&#13;
competitive are the most likely to sustain growth.&#13;
In all regions, progress is evident but obstacles remain. Africa's advances cannot keep&#13;
pace with poverty, as conflict persists and HIV/AIDS continues its ravage of the continent's&#13;
working-age people as well as of its children. Recovery in crisis-hit East Asia was better than&#13;
expected, and the crisis' social impact less than feared, but an overhang of domestic bad debt&#13;
clouds the picture. South Asia continued to lead the developing world in growth but poverty&#13;
remains entrenched, and conflict situations are diverting public resources. Eastern Europe is&#13;
facing challenges of poverty and inequality that were unknown a decade ago. Inequality also&#13;
mars Latin American and Caribbean nations' economic and social landscape; in addition,&#13;
these countries fell victim to natural disasters during the year. The numbers of poor are also&#13;
rising in the Middle East and North Africa region, where, despite economic advances, high&#13;
unemployment persists.&#13;
The international goal of halving the proportion of the world's population living in&#13;
absolute poverty by 2015 is attainable but difficult, according to World Development Indicators 2000&#13;
(WDI 2000; see Box s.s; see also "The Poverty Challenge" at the beginning of this report). The&#13;
report finds that the goal can be reached if economic growth resumes (and indeed accelerates)&#13;

a. To better capture the evolving nature of Bank operations, the Bank's sector classification system is reviewed and changed as appropnate. In fiscal 2000, two new sector categoies&#13;
were created (Economic Policy and Private Sector Development) and one sector category was dropped (Industry). Economic Policy comprises operations that support macroeconomic&#13;
policy, trade, and other economic and institutional reforms, It includes structural adjustment operations previously assigned to Multisector and some operations previously assigned to&#13;
Finance. Private Sector Development comprises operations dealing with the business environment, private infrastructure, small scale enterprise, and privatization issues. As such, it&#13;
includes some operations previously assigned to Industry and to Public Sector Management. Other operations previously included under Industry have been assigned to Public Sector&#13;
Management. In addition, a few individual operations approved in FY98-99 were reassigned, including an FY99 project from Agriculture to Water Supply and Sanitation.&#13;
b. This column shows lending by sector, based on a classification by major loan component. The example of a $100 million mining loan, with components aimed at addressing environ.&#13;
mental, financial, and social protection needs, serves as an illustration. In the case of loan-by-loan classification, the full amount of the loan appears in the Mining sector: in the compo-&#13;
nent classification, the full amount is spht among the four sectors--Mining, Environment. Finance, and Social Protection. As a result, total lending of $1 .5 billion for Social Protection in&#13;
the component classification is the sum of all social protection components within loans approved in fiscal 2000.&#13;

SECTION II&#13;
The Board of&#13;
Executive Directors&#13;
T           She Executive Directors are responsible for the conduct of the Bank's gen-&#13;
eral operations; they perform their duties under powers delegated by the&#13;
Board of Governors. As provided in the Articles of Agreement, 5 of the&#13;
24 Executive Directors are appointed by the member countries having&#13;
the largest number of shares; the rest are elected by the other member&#13;
countries, which form constituencies in an election process conducted every two years.&#13;
Executive Directors consider and decide on IBRD loan and IDA credit proposals&#13;
made by the President, and they decide on policies that guide the general operations of&#13;
the Bank. They are also responsible for presenting to the Board of Governors at the&#13;
Annual Meetings an audit of accounts, an administrative budget, and an Annual&#13;
Report (this report) on the Bank's operations and policies, as well as any other matters&#13;
deemed necessary in their judgment.&#13;
During fiscal zooo, Executive Directors regularly met at Bank headquarters twice a&#13;
week with frequent additional meetings, both formal and informal, Directors also serve&#13;
on one or more of five standing committees: Audit, Development Effectiveness, Budget,&#13;
Personnel, and Executive Directors' Administrative Matters. The committees help the&#13;
Board discharge its oversight responsibilities through in-depth examinations of policies&#13;
and practices.&#13;
In addition, groups of Executive Directors and Alternate Executive Directors period-&#13;
ically visit borrowing countries to observe, first-hand, Bank assistance in progress. They&#13;
meet with project managers, beneficiaries, government officials, nongovernmental orga-&#13;
nizations, the business community, as well as other development partners, financial&#13;
institutions, and resident Bank staff In fiscal zooo, Directors visited Indonesia, Kenya,&#13;
Madagascar, Mauritius, Rwanda, and the Solomon Islands. Executive Directors' over-&#13;
sight responsibility covers all Bank policies and activities, including approval of all len-&#13;
ding operations and the annual budget. In shaping Bank policy, the Board takes into&#13;
account the evolving perspectives of member countries on the role of the Bank Group&#13;
as well as the Bank's operational experience. Directors also play an active role in prepar-&#13;
ing the agenda and issues papers for the semi-annual meetings of the joint Bank-Fund&#13;

Taking on the Challenge&#13;
or several reasons, effective performance evaluation-understanding what&#13;
works and what does not-has taken on a new urgency. Development&#13;
risks are on the rise. Local involvement in development programs is&#13;
increasing. And governments are more accountable to citizens for devel-&#13;
opment effectiveness.&#13;
The World Bank strives for development effectiveness by continuously learning&#13;
from experience and focusing on quality and results (see Box 3.I). Evaluation is crucial&#13;
to these efforts: it strengthens accountability, improves the quality of operations, and&#13;
informs strategy, policy, and resource allocation. Since 1997, the Bank's evaluation&#13;
strategy has emphasized: participatory evaluation, to actively involve all relevant stake-&#13;
holders; knowledge management, to identif$ best practices in development and to&#13;
inform Bank and country policies; and "real time" feedback, to help management&#13;
assess the performance of projects under implementation.&#13;

DEVELOPMENT AND PIPELINE PROJECT&#13;
The IVorld Bank Board approved support for a project to develop oilfields in southern Chad and to build a 1,070 km&#13;
pipeline to off-shore oil loadingfacilities on Cameroon s Atlantic coast. The project will cost an estimated $3.7 billion; its&#13;
private sponsors, a consortium of oil companties including ExxonMobil (USA), Petronas (Malaysia), and Chevron (UsA),&#13;
are providing the bulk of thefunding. Bank Group support includes s93 million on IBRD terms ($53.4 million to&#13;
Cameroon and $39.5 million to Chad) and sioo million from the International Finance Corporation (IFC).&#13;
Bank Group role. Financing was only one element of Bank Group supportfor this project. National and international&#13;
civil society groups had expressed strong concerns related to the use of oil revenue, the environment, human resettlement, the&#13;
project' impact oni indigenous peoples, and public consultations. These groups also tioted that the region's natural resource&#13;
"booms" had, in the past, a negative impact on poverty reduction efforts. In response, the Bank, working closely with the gov-&#13;
ernments and private sponsors, redoubled its efforts to ensure a project design that would respond to these concerns. The result&#13;
was the development in Chad of a sound revenue management program targeting signficantfunds to education, health,&#13;
rural development, infrastructure, and environmental management, with to percent of revenue held in trustforfuturegener-&#13;
ations, Application of the Bank's environmental and social safeguard policies also resulted in the re-routing of the pipeline&#13;
to ensure protection of biodiversity, human settlements, indigenous peoples, and cultural heritage. The pipeline will be buried,&#13;
and two large national parks have been newly created. Project-related public consultation started in 1993 and evolved&#13;
considerably throughout project preparation. The mFcs role has also been important in mobilizing long-termfinatice and in&#13;
supplying technical skillsforfinancing.&#13;

6 million Chadians live on less then si a day, infant mortality is high, amid access to basic social services is extremely limit-&#13;
ed. Thegovernmnent'sprogramfor use of the new revenues, estimated at nearly $2 billion for Chad over 25 years, targets key&#13;
sectors of its poverty alleviation strategy. Other expected benefits are infrastructure improvements in Cameroon and Chad,&#13;
employment getieration, local procurement, capacity building, and increased private investment in both countries.&#13;

BOX 4.5 SUPPORTING BHUTAN'S UNIQUE VISION FOR DEVELOPMENT&#13;
Nestled in the remote eastern Himalayas, the tiny Kingdom of Bhutan has made great progress in improving the living standards&#13;
of its people since first embarking on modernization in the early i96os. Over 70 percent of primary school-age children are now&#13;
in school, compared with only35 percent in the early 19705. Bhutan has a unique vision for social transformation: policies aim to&#13;
preserve the country's strong cultural and environmental heritage.&#13;
Infiscal 2000, the Bank developed a CAS that supports Bhutan's vision and development priorfties. At the country's request,&#13;
the strategy emphasizes the transfer of knowledge and ideas, rather thanfinance. In one such initiative, the Bank is helping Bhutan&#13;

BOX 4.9 PROMOTING LAND MARKET INSTITUTIONS AND&#13;
SUSTAINABLE IRRIGATION IN THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
In the Kyrgyz Republic, agriculture accountsfor nearly half of GDP and employment particularly il rural areas where two-&#13;
thirds of the population reside and where poverty is concentrated, Agricultural growth is a high priority in the national economic&#13;
strategy. To pronmote eficient use of land resources, ii,i has been working with the government to build infrastructure and intstitu-&#13;
tional capacity. Two new credits were approved iifiscal 2ooo:&#13;
2&gt;   The Land and Real Estate Registration Project takes-forward the land privatization rJorlms that have boosted agricultural&#13;
production since l996 by putting in place arrangements to protect property rights and facilitate market activity in land. The project&#13;
addresses rural needs but will also foster development of urban real estate markets.&#13;
&gt; The On-Farm Irrigation Project helps build sustainable irrigation systems by establishing UIhater User Associations $Yv'usA&#13;
and rehabilitating distribktion systems serving private farmers. To promote sustainability, the project supports adequate rnainte-&#13;

JDA's role. iDA s experience in land reforini-related issues in cis and other countriesgves it a unique advantage in providing&#13;
such support to the Kyrgy: Republic. Complernentary ID.I supportfor rural development, privatization, banking reform, andfiscal&#13;

SECTION V&#13;
Thematic Perspectives&#13;
POVERTY IN THE VOICES OF THE POOR&#13;
n an effort to understand poverty from the perspective of poor people themselves, the World Bank&#13;
undertook a 6o-country participatory study, known as Voices of the Poor. The study was conducted as&#13;
background for the itDk 20oo/2002 and consists of two parts: a review of recent participatory&#13;
studies in 50 countries involving 40,000 poor women and men; and a comparative study in 1999&#13;
involving zo,ooo people in 23 countries.' What emerges is that poverty entails multiple and inter-&#13;
locking disadvantages that frequently leave poor people powerless to better their lives.&#13;
Poor people emphasize material deprivation but also speak of social, physical and psychological&#13;
dimensions and lack of freedom of choice and action. Their livelihoods are often precarious, seasonal and&#13;
inadequate; many see economic conditions worsening. Their villages and slums are often isolated, lacking&#13;
in basic services and transport. Hunger and illness are common, and access to medical care, difficult.&#13;
Especially in urban areas, crime and violence pose daily threats; police protection is scarce. Within the&#13;
household, domestic violence against women remains widespread even though more poor women are earn-&#13;
ing incomes than ever before. Descriptions of poverty also often encompass mental distress and anxiety&#13;
about the future. "Poverty is lack of freedom, enslaved by crushing daily burdens, by depression and fear&#13;
of what the future will bring," says a participant from the Caucuses.&#13;
Poor people highlight powerlessness, pointing to officials, traders and civic actors who are neither&#13;
responsive nor accountable to them. They share numerous examples of criminality, abuse and corruption in&#13;
encounters with public institutions, saying they have little recourse to justice. "Government has let us down,&#13;
too many promises-never fulfilling them)' says a 30-year-old unemployed mother from the Caribbean. In&#13;
poor communities worldwide, local groups and actors are key supports; however, poor people recognize&#13;
limits to how much "one hungry man can help another hungry man."&#13;

There are two potential sources of interest rate     ucts, wA'hich currently account for I6% of the existing&#13;
risk to IBRD. The first is the interest rate sensitivitv  loan portfolio (I8%  at the end of FY 1999), is man-&#13;
associated with the net spread between the rate IBRD       aged by using interest rate swaps to closely align the&#13;
earns on its assets and the cost of borrowings which      rate sensitivity characteristics of the loan portfolio&#13;
fund those assets. The second is the interest rate sen-   with those of their underlying funding. As the portfo-&#13;

higher average debt costs would not be passed through     between the contractual maturity or repricing of&#13;

            The World Bank annual report 2000
        </repnme>

            This annual report, which covers the
            period from July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2000, spells out the
            guiding principles of the Bank's work: country
            ownership, long-term integrated approach, partnership, and
            results focus. This vision was put into practice under a
            pilot approach, the Comprehensive Development Framework. The
            following are some of the highlights of Fiscal Year 2000: a)
            The share of projects at risk of not achieving their
            development objectives fell to an estimated 15 percent of
            the total in fiscal 2000, or roughly half the rate of fiscal
            1998. b) New lending commitments declined to $15.3 billion.
            c) Seven countries qualified for debt relief under the
            enhanced initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, six
            of them in Africa. d) The Bank and the International
            Monetary Fund began to help countries prepare Poverty
            Reduction Strategies, which are becoming the basis for debt
            relief and concessional lending by the Bank, the Fund, and
            other development partners. e) The Bank announced up to $1
            billion support to help borrowers of the International
            Development Association to combat HIV/AIDS, and to address
            priority social problems with cross-border or global
            dimensions - with a special focus on Africa, and active
            partnership in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization.
