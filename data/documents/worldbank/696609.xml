analysis), P. Bodnar (divestiture of social facilities), and G. Pilch (legal). The peer reviewers&#13;
were A. Ewing (PSD) and J. Strongman (IEN). The Division Chief is T. Blinkhorn (EC4MS)&#13;
and the Department Director is B. Kavalsky (EC4).&#13;
Engineering analysis was provided by T. Hastelow (U.K.), labor analysis by B. Weston (U.K.)&#13;
and environmental analysis by G. Stephenson and J. Korol (Canada). Ms. T. Kanterman&#13;
provided staff assistant support. Organizations that participated in the project preparation include&#13;
the Ukranian Ministry of Coal Industry, the Donetsk Coal Mining Research Institutes, the&#13;
Donetsk Oblast Administration, and the three municipal and raion governments.&#13;
The report draws on the Bank's sector report "Coal Industry Restructuring", (Report No. 15056-&#13;
UA), which was discussed with the Government of Ukraine in January 1996 in London&#13;
(concurrent with visits to British coal mines). The sector report was distributed to the Board in&#13;
March 1996 and was disseminated in a Coal Conference, held in Kiev on April 11-12, 1996.&#13;

Implementing Agencies:     Ministry of Coal Industry (MCI); the Ukrainian State Company for&#13;
Restructuring of Coal Industry Enterprises (UDKR); Donetsk Oblast;&#13;
city administrations of Donetsk, Yenakievo, and Snezhnoye.&#13;
Affected Parties:          Employees of coal mines who are affected by the sector restructuring&#13;
program.&#13;
Poverty Category:         The project includes measures to reduce poverty in affected areas, and&#13;
to generate employment and income through a variety of measures,&#13;
such as micro-credit and job creation.&#13;
Amount:                    US$15.8 million equivalent&#13;
Terms:                     Payable in 17 years, with 5 years grace at the Bank's standard&#13;
variable rate.&#13;
Commitment Fee:           0.75 % on undisbursed credit balances, beginning 60 days after&#13;
signing, less any waiver.&#13;
Onlending Terms:           Loan proceeds would be passed on to the UDKR and the local&#13;
governments on a grant basis, with the exception of the micro credit&#13;
component which will be on-lent to individual borrowers at interest&#13;
rates in accord with the Government's financial policy, taking into&#13;
account the National Bank of Ukraine discount rate, the administrative&#13;
costs and lending risk. The Government would carry the foreign&#13;
exchange and credit risk.&#13;
Project Objectives:       The central objective is to mitigate the social and environmental&#13;
consequences that arise from mine closures, as part of an overall&#13;
Government restructuring program for the sector. The project seeks&#13;
to: (i) test ways to implement mine closures safely, with due regard to&#13;
technical, environmental, economic, financial and social aspects; (ii)&#13;
ensure that mine workers are afforded opportunities to either transfer&#13;
to other jobs in the sector or exit the industry with reasonable&#13;
compensation and a choice of assistance for seeking other&#13;
employment; (iii) transfer social assets to municipal management and&#13;
support their rationalization, while helping to ensure that the most&#13;
vulnerable groups are adequately protected in terms of access to&#13;
services; and (iv) through monitoring and feedback, gain experience&#13;
from the Pilot Project for subsequent operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
Project Description:       (a) Mitigation of physical closure (environmental mitigation,&#13;
equipment and civil works); (b) social mitigation and re-employment&#13;
support (social protection payments, coal distributions, job creation,&#13;
and micro-credit subcomponents); social services support though the&#13;
transfer of assets to the municipalities (housing, kindergartens, cultural&#13;
facilities); institutional strengthening through support for the&#13;
incremental operating costs of the UDKR; and technical services&#13;
(including management of the mitigation program, feasibility studies&#13;
for new investment, and social assessment and monitoring/evaluation).&#13;
Financing Plan:            Bank loan would finance 55 percent of total project costs; Government&#13;
of Ukraine, 40 percent; and bilateral grants, 5 percent, for technical&#13;
services (see Schedule A).&#13;
Economic Rate of Return:    Economic rate of return (ERR) ranges from 20 percent to 90 percent&#13;
for the 3 mines, with an overall rate of 55 percent.&#13;
Environmental Category B:   Environmental Management Plan with site-specific mitigation&#13;
measures would be prepared.&#13;

COAL PILOT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. REFORM OF THE COAL SECTOR&#13;
A. Economic and Sectoral Background&#13;
1.1    The coal industry is in deep crisis in Ukraine. Between 1990 and 1995, coal output decreased&#13;
by about 50 percent to 80 million tons/year. The productivity of Ukrainian coal miners -- about 600&#13;
thousand workers employed directly in coal extraction -- is low, not only by international comparison&#13;
but even by historical Ukrainian standards. In the 1980s, domestically produced coal covered about&#13;
one-third of Ukraine's primary energy consumption, and was also one of Ukraine's major export&#13;
commodities. Coal exports almost totally disappeared in 1995, and imported coal and other fuels&#13;
captured a large share of the Ukrainian market as a result of high domestic coal prices, untimely&#13;
delivery, and poor coal quality.&#13;
1.2    Like any extractive industry, the Ukrainian coal industry must close mines when reserves&#13;
become exhausted. While a few mines have been closed in the past five years, this has not been&#13;
done in any concerted manner because of concern about throwing large number of miners (and related&#13;
service employees) out of work and depriving them of income and access to social services currently&#13;
provided by the coal enterprises. But the delay has had its cost: as a result, a significant part of the&#13;
coal industry is irreparably uneconomic. The resources required to keep these high cost mines in&#13;
operation could have been better deployed for the full utilization and modernization of the capacity of&#13;
lower cost mines that have a chance to remain competitive.&#13;
1.3    Due to high material, energy, and labor costs, the coal industry is unable to cover its&#13;
production costs. In addition to producing coal, the mining companies also deliver services including&#13;
pre-school education, housing, recreation, etc. Carrying the cost of these services further reduces the&#13;
competitiveness of Ukrainian coal mines. Payment arrears accumulated by many of the large coal&#13;
consumers further exacerbate financial difficulties, contributing to the inability of many mining&#13;
enterprises to pay salaries. The capacity and the willingness of the state to subsidize coal production&#13;
dropped to an all-time low by 1995, due to a general decline of budgetary revenues in a shrinking&#13;
economy, and the recognition by policy makers that further large-scale production subsidies&#13;
endangered the macroeconomic stabilization effort (see para 2.25).&#13;
1.4   In order to restore the competitiveness of the Ukrainian coal industry, average unit costs need&#13;
to be reduced by at least 20 percent. This will require, among other things, the closure of at least 75&#13;
high cost mines over a period of 4-5 years (the closure of these mines itself will reduce the average&#13;
unit cost by about 9 percent, with possible additional gains coming from the increased capacity&#13;
utilization of remaining mines). However, the social and environmental impact of the mine closures&#13;
needs careful mitigation measures because of the special historical and economic importance of the&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.5    Few countries in the Former Soviet Union (FSU) or Eastern Europe have implemented a&#13;
thorough restructuring of the coal sector, including price liberalization, market deregulation, closures&#13;
of old mines, and modernization of plant and equipment in profitable mines, to provide a framework&#13;
for competitive viability. Yet extractive industries need to close uneconomic operations on a regular&#13;
basis so that the viable segments of the industry do not get drained by the unprofitable ones. In April&#13;
1995, the Government of Ukraine (GoU) took the courageous decision to begin restructuring the coal&#13;
sector, initiating sectoral reforms, and starting a program of mine closures. Old, unsafe mines (about&#13;
40-70 in number) that have no economic future were targeted for closure, to free resources for the&#13;
segments of the industry that have better economic prospects (about 50 such mines). However, since&#13;
the mines to be closed -- like most enterprises in the FSU -- provide a range of social services, as&#13;
well as significant regional employment, the program needed to tackle the social aspects, along with&#13;
the technical aspects. In May 1995, the Government requested the Bank to assist in tackling these&#13;
issues in an integrated manner. The Bank embarked on the necessary analysis to help design an&#13;
approach that would help mitigate the social and environmental effects of mine closures.&#13;
1.6    The sector. The coal industry includes the following institutions:&#13;
*      the Ministry of Coal Industry (MCI);&#13;
-      39 mining associations, of which 24 are engaged in coal production and 15 in related&#13;
fields (3 in coal washing, 5 in mine construction and automation, 2 in mining&#13;
equipment repair, 3 in ecological and geological research, 1 in designing experimental&#13;
equipment, 1 specialized in shaft design and sinking);&#13;
3      244 mines, most of which are within the 23 production associations (each association&#13;
controls 8 to 16 mines);&#13;
e      related social assets (i.e. schools, housing, health facilities) and transport&#13;
organizations.&#13;
B. The Government's Reform Program&#13;
1.7    On January 19, 1996, the Government of Ukraine, in discussions held in London (in&#13;
conjunction with visits to British coal mines) laid out its reform program for the coal sector (Annex&#13;
1).' These reforms include:&#13;
(a)     Establishment of coal markets by providing enterprises the right to sell their coal at&#13;
prices freely negotiated with customers;&#13;
(b)     Corporatization of viable coal mines while transferring the mines identified for closure&#13;
to a newly created entity, Ukrainian State Company for Coal Restructuring&#13;
Enterprises (UDKR), entrusted with the management of the mine closure process;&#13;
1/ The agreed measures build on several previously announced Government programs, such as the "Program for the&#13;
Development of the Coal Mining Industry of Ukraine and its Social Sphere up to the Year 2005," and the list totalling 39&#13;
mines designated for closure beginning in 1995 and 1996, which was published in the Spring of 1995. The recent&#13;
agreements represent a more thorough reform of policy, and more rapid introduction of needed measures, at lower cost,&#13;
than the previous programs. This program was discussed with representatives from the mining industry as well as national&#13;
and local government officials at a conference held in Kiev on April 10-12, 1996. A decree of the President on Coal Sector&#13;
Restructuring is included as Annex 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
(c)    Closure of uneconomic mines with the aim of minimizing the technical cost and the&#13;
time required for closure while taking into account the need to protect the&#13;
environment and the livelihood of people affected by mine closures;&#13;
(d)    Transfer of social assets and liabilities from the mining industry to local governments;&#13;
(e)    Development and implementation of programs to support the generation of&#13;
employment in regions or cities where major job losses occur as a result of mine&#13;
closures and the rationalization of employment in remaining mines;&#13;
(f)    Elimination of cross-subsidies between mining enterprises and allowing enterprises to&#13;
decide about the best use of their operating profits; and&#13;
(g)    Concentration of state support on covering the technical and social costs of mine&#13;
closures while relying on the banking sector to provide funds for commercially viable&#13;
investments.&#13;
1.8    These measures were incorporated in a Presidential Decree issued on February 10, 1996&#13;
(Annex 2). Consistent with the above program of reforms, several measures were taken in late 1995&#13;
and the beginning of 1996 that are crucial to the restructuring program. A new organization -- the&#13;
Ukrainska Derzhavna Kompania z Restrukturizatsii Pidpriemstv Vulhilnoi Promislovennosti or&#13;
Ukrainian State Company for Restructuring Coal Industry Enterprises (UDKR) -- was created to&#13;
manage the closure process. The closure program would encompass technical, social, and&#13;
organizational aspects, which UDKR would be responsible for handling, working closely with the&#13;
relevant municipalities.&#13;
1.9    UDKR reports to MCI and is funded directly from the State budget. The "Charter" of this&#13;
organization specifies that UDKR is required to close the mines as quickly and economically as&#13;
practical, so that it does not become a subsidized coal production company, competing with the new&#13;
joint stock companies (JSCs), which are intended to replace the coal production associations.&#13;
1.10   MCI's earlier plans for mine closure estimated the average time required for the closure of a&#13;
mine at three years, with a range of up to 13 years. The experience of other countries that have&#13;
closed uneconomic mines demonstrates that rapid closures with only a minimal recovery of old plant&#13;
and machinery is the most cost-effective approach; normally, this process should take no more than&#13;
12-18 months. For the Pilot Project, the preparation of physical closure plans (by local design&#13;
institutes) has been guided by the objective of cost minimization; other objectives such as job creation&#13;
and ensuring the continuation of essential social services have been addressed through separate&#13;
mechanisms in the project design.&#13;
C. Possible Operations in the Coal Sector&#13;
1.11   To assist the Government in tackling the extensive problems facing the coal sector, the Bank&#13;
prepared a sector study and is preparing three lending operations in FY96-98. These are the Coal&#13;
Pilot Project, a Coal Restructuring Project, and a Coal Sector Adjustment Loan.&#13;
1.12   Coal Pilot Project. In view of the many complex, partly unresolved technical and social&#13;
issues facing the policy makers in sector restructuring, the Bank and the Government agreed to begin&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
with a Pilot Project in which funding would be made available for mitigating the social and&#13;
environmental impacts of the closure of three mines. The mines are: Pravda2, Krasniy Oktyabr, and&#13;
Removskaya, all located in the heart of the coal mining region of eastern Ukraine (see map) and each&#13;
reflecting different economic and social conditions. The three mines currently employ about 4,700&#13;
workers. The criteria for selection are discussed in para 3.2, while Annexes 3-5 present the profiles&#13;
of the mines/towns. The project would give the Government valuable experience in implementing&#13;
mitigation measures, enabling a stronger design of the subsequent projects.&#13;
1.13   Coal Restructuring Project. To reduce the large subsidies from the national budget to the coal&#13;
sector, and to allow profiLable mines a chance to succeed, the Government decided to restructure the&#13;
sector, using a diverse program that includes policy reforms, closure of uneconomic mines, social and&#13;
institutional re-organization, and modernization of mines with strong economic prospects. The&#13;
Restructuring Project, as currently envisaged, would include mitigation of the social and&#13;
environmental impacts of the closure of more than 20 mines. The total costs of the Restructuring&#13;
Project would be about $120 million, with a possible Bank loan of about $80 million. Scope and&#13;
timing of the Restructuring Project will be influenced by progress in implementation of the Pilot&#13;
Project.&#13;
1.14   Coal Sector Adjustment Loan. In parallel, the Government has requested assistance for a&#13;
broader sectoral reform program, based on the action program elaborated in the Bank's sector report&#13;
and summarized in the London Protocol. This Protocol draws on the Bank report "Ukraine:&#13;
Restructuring the Coal Sector" which was distributed to the Board in March 1996. The Bank is&#13;
working on preparation of a coal sector adjustment loan (SECAL) to support the sector reform&#13;
program.&#13;
II. SECTORAL ISSUES AFFECTING MITIGATION&#13;
A. The Coal Industry in a Changing Region&#13;
2.1    Donetsk city, with a population of 1.2 million persons, is the capital of Donetsk Oblast (see&#13;
map) and one of 23 oblasts in Ukraine. Donetsk is the center of the Donbas region, a densely&#13;
populated industrial and mining belt measuring about two hundred kilometers across its north-south&#13;
and east-west extensions. The Donbas used to be the principal iron and coal region of the Soviet&#13;
Union, but the region is now in deep recession. Even before the break-up of the Soviet Union,&#13;
investment had moved to the lower cost, open-pit mines in Russia and Kazakhstan. Nearly all mines&#13;
in the Donbas region are deep seam mines, many of them 100 years old or more. In many mines,&#13;
reserves are virtually depleted and production figures per worker are among the lowest in the world.3&#13;
2.2    The Donetsk Oblast has a population of 5.27 million persons. The regional economy's&#13;
problems are typical of coal mining regions in other countries (U.K., France, Belgium, Poland to&#13;
2/ The full name of this mine group is: "Mine Named after the Newspaper Pravda."&#13;
3/ For similar reasons, there are also numerous unprofitable mines in the Dniepropetrovsk region in Central Ukraine, and,&#13;
in the Lviv - Volyn region in Western Ukraine.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
name a few). The oblast used to be a center of economic activity, and attracted labor and investment&#13;
from across the former Soviet Union. However, the region has not kept pace with a dramatically&#13;
changed economic environment, and both surplus labor and deteriorated plants now contribute to the&#13;
region's economic ill-health. The coal mines are the most prominent illustration of the region's&#13;
problems: (i) the sector is severely overmanned, (ii) the capital stock is dilapidated, and (iii) there is&#13;
little new investment which could generate jobs elsewhere in the local economy. State enterprises&#13;
dominate officially recorded production; yet it is the unofficial economy which is providing modest&#13;
economic growth.&#13;
2.3    Regional economic development activities could help to reduce dependence on the coal sector,&#13;
but substantial new investment is needed. A more diversified economy would be the best hedge&#13;
against the ongoing contraction of the coal industry. Other regions in Ukraine are also struggling to&#13;
cope with the adverse consequences of industrial contraction (e.g. Temopil, Lviv, and Odessa).&#13;
These cities are taking an aggressive approach to marketing their regions nationally and&#13;
internationally, to attract new investment. Similar measures to increase labor mobility and job-&#13;
seeking could help stimulate regional and sectoral diversification in Donetsk (para 3.28).&#13;
B. Technical Issues&#13;
Physical closure&#13;
2.4    Mines close because of depletion of their mineral reserves or because the remaining reserves&#13;
have become uneconomic as a result of deteriorating geological conditions and more competitive&#13;
markets. Physical closure of an underground coal mine usually involves the following nine steps: (a)&#13;
arresting underground development work which would prepare new mine panels for coal extraction;&#13;
(b) mining out the prepared mine panels, if this low-cost operation can be economically justified; (c)&#13;
recovering equipment and materials, if there is a market for them, and if the prices paid by buyers&#13;
cover the costs of the recovery, including the extra cost of keeping the mine open longer; (d) sealing-&#13;
off galleries and other underground workings to the extent required for protection of neighboring&#13;
mines; (e) preparing the shafts for filling by removing obstructing installations; (f) filling the shafts&#13;
with rock normally taken from the waste dump of the mine; (g) installing a safe cover made of&#13;
reinforced concrete at the surface opening of the shafts; (h) dismantling and demolishing surface&#13;
installations and buildings; and (i) cleaning-up the surface area. During and after the closing period,&#13;
additional measures may be necessary to deal with gas and water emission from the mine.&#13;
2.5   In fast-track closure, extraction from prepared panels is not completed and recovery of&#13;
equipment and materials is minimized, in order to shorten the time and lower the high fixed costs of&#13;
mine ventilation, water pumping and general mine maintenance. At some mines, water pumping may&#13;
need to be continued temporarily to prevent flooding of the neighboring mines. Rapid closure has&#13;
been successfully applied in the U.K. and can be easily adopted in Ukrainian coal mines, from the&#13;
technical point of view.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.6    Environmental conditions (air and water quality primarily) in Ukraine's coal sector are similar&#13;
to the situation in several other coal mining countries. For example, environmental conditions in the&#13;
Donetsk area are less severe than in the North Bohemia coal field in the Czech Republic, the&#13;
Katowice coal field in Poland, the Jharia coal field in India, and the Shanxi coal field in China, but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
worse than in Germany, Belgium and Hungary today. The present environmental situation in the&#13;
Donetsk coal fields is comparable to that which existed in the older underground coal fields of the&#13;
U.S.A. and the U.K. during the 1950s-60s.&#13;
2.7    The Bank has begun to examine the environmental laws, regulations and procedures, and&#13;
institutional capabilities in Ukraine with regard to closing of mines (the Pilot Project would expand&#13;
this work, and would monitor the consistency of Ukraine environmental standards with institutional&#13;
standards and their compliance). In closing mines, domestic design institutes mostly follow Ukrainian&#13;
procedures applicable for environmental and safety aspects while the Government supervisory&#13;
agencies, in theory, monitor the execution of environmentally acceptable closing plans (see below).&#13;
In practice, the agencies are short-staffed and under-trained.&#13;
2.8   In the past four years, due to insufficient funds available for investment and operation, the&#13;
environmental situation and safety conditions in the coal mining region have deteriorated markedly.&#13;
For example, life expectancy in the coal fields for underground workers (who are all male; women&#13;
work in occupations at the surface) is considered to be about ten years less than in other occupations&#13;
in Ukraine. Accidents resulted in 340 miners having lost their lives in 1995 in on-site or&#13;
underground mishaps. The three main environmental concerns are:&#13;
(a)    Contamination of ground and surface water due to on-going and past mining activities.&#13;
The mines in the Donbas area produce an average of 3 m3 of waste water for every&#13;
ton of coal produced. The salinity of this water ranges from as little as 30 mg/l to an&#13;
environmentally hazardous 4,000 mg/l or more. Discharge of this water has raised&#13;
salinity concentrations in some rivers to levels that severely limit use of the water for&#13;
water supply or irrigation. In some cases mine water is utilized to dilute municipal&#13;
waste water, including sewage, before disposal into the nearest river system;&#13;
(b)    Pyramidal piles of rock and waste material have formed at all underground mines.&#13;
On the surface of some piles, combustible material is starting a smoldering fire&#13;
through self-ignition. Noxious gases emitted may include carbon monoxide, hydrogen&#13;
sulphide and nitrous oxides, creating a health hazard for local inhabitants living down-&#13;
wind. Due to rain and erosion, rock masses may slide along the sides of the dump,&#13;
endangering property or individuals; and&#13;
(c)    Atmospheric pollution. Gases from burning dumps are perhaps the worst&#13;
contaminant. In addition, fine dust blown from waste and coal stock piles may result&#13;
in high levels of particulates.&#13;
2.9    Annex 6 contains a summary of environmental issues, mitigation measures, and a guide for&#13;
preparing an environmental management plan with site-specific mitigation measures. These plans will&#13;
be completed in the first stage of implementation of the Pilot Project by August 1996. Besides the&#13;
three issues discussed above, two other areas of concern are the surface strength of land above&#13;
shallow mine workings, and the potential emission of methane gas from abandoned mines. Paras&#13;
3.11-3.14 discuss the project's environmental mitigation measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
C. Divestiture of Social Infrastructure&#13;
2.10   The coal industry owns and operates a wide range of social infrastructure (kindergartens,&#13;
houses, medical facilities, etc.). About 77,000 people (or about 8 percent of all employees) are&#13;
engaged in the operation and maintenance of these assets. The average cost recovery from the&#13;
beneficiaries of social services is only about 20 percent of actual cost, estimated with a range of 10-60&#13;
percent among production associations and variance according to the type of social assets. In 1995,&#13;
after deducting contributions from the beneficiaries, the cost of operating and maintaining these assets&#13;
was estimated to have totaled US$ 150 million, representing about 7 percent of total coal production&#13;
costs. The continued provision of these services by the mines would: (i) continue to divert the&#13;
attention of management from the key task of coal production; (ii) increase the cost of coal, thereby&#13;
reducing the competitiveness of domestic coal mining industry; and (iii) maintain the existing&#13;
inefficiencies in service provision. For these reasons, the Government decided to divest the social&#13;
assets and transfer the liabilities to local governments with some budget support.&#13;
2.11   The two basic methods to be applied in the divestiture of social infrastructure are the transfer&#13;
of the assets to local governments and privatization: (i) kindergartens would be transferred to local&#13;
governmenmt, in the context of city-wide programs of rationalizing their utilization; (ii) summer&#13;
camps, rest houses and vacation facilities would be privatized where possible; (iii) sport and cultural&#13;
facilities would be transferred to local governments, to be privatized at a later stage; (iv) profilactoria&#13;
(rest and recuperation facilities) and sanatoria would be rationalized and placed under existing medical&#13;
facilities operated by the regional and central government; and (v) housing stock would be transferred&#13;
to local governments, to be privatized later. Together with the housing stock, the infrastructure and&#13;
staff of the maintenance organizations and utilities would be transferred to local organizations.&#13;
2.12   On November 6, 1995 the Cabinet of Ministers adopted a resolution concerning the transfer&#13;
to "communal property" of enterprise housing stock.4 Under Ukraine's property laws, this transfer&#13;
means that the housing should be owned and managed by the municipalities in which it is located.&#13;
This policy is consistent with the recommendations above. Implementation of this policy will present&#13;
challenges: since centrally mandated user charges for housing and communal services are still below&#13;
production costs, municipalities will face increased operating deficits as they assume responsibility for&#13;
coal enterprises' housing stock. Nevertheless, budgeted increases in cost recovery on housing, to&#13;
between 60 and 80 percent of maintenance costs in 1996, will help alleviate this problem.&#13;
2.13   Another reason Ukrainian municipalities are reluctant to accept the transfer of mine-owned&#13;
housing is that they do not want to inherit the obligation to renovate this housing, which like much of&#13;
the rest of Ukraine's housing stock is long overdue for capital renovation. There is strong sentiment&#13;
among both the mine managers and among the city administrations that the Government should&#13;
provide for this overdue capital renovation in the context of the transfer from enterprises to&#13;
municipalities. There is a parallel sentiment that the long housing waiting lists should be consolidated&#13;
at the time of transfer. However, both the housing waiting lists and the overdue capital repairs stem&#13;
from a chronic lack of capital funds for housing investments. Even if the Government wanted to use&#13;
public funds to address these capital needs, the problems are not limited to the coal sector, and are&#13;
not likely to be resolved quickly, considering Ukraine's current financial situation. It is generally&#13;
4/ Resolution No. 891 of the Cabinet of Ministers of November 6, 1995, 'On transfer of enterprise housing stock to&#13;
communal property."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
thought that housing privatization will need to proceed at its own pace, while specific interventions to&#13;
help provide an enabling environment for a future private housing market could help speed up the&#13;
process (e.g. the Ukraine Housing Loan, which was approved by the Board on March 14, 1996).&#13;
D. Labor Issues&#13;
2.14   The closure of uneconomic mines and the need to reduce costs in all mines after the industry&#13;
starts to operate competitively will significantly reduce the number of jobs available in coal&#13;
extraction. Perhaps half of the workers directly employed in coal extraction may have to leave the&#13;
industry over the next five years. Taking into account likely job reductions in other areas (e.g.,&#13;
washing plants, construction, and the social sphere), up to 300-400,000 workers may need to exit&#13;
from the coal industry over the medium term. This number represents the largest restructuring&#13;
programs ever attempted in Europe. This task is made more complicated by the high concentration of&#13;
mining activities in the Donbas region. Furthermore, the country and the mining industry have to&#13;
start this process in a period of extreme scarcity of financial resources and the lack of alternative&#13;
employment. Additional problems are an inadequate incentive framework for private sector&#13;
investment, lack of fiscal and policy decentralization (which would enable regional and local&#13;
authorities to develop imaginative programs to deal with their region's specific needs), and a general&#13;
lack of labor mobility.&#13;

2.15   Natural attrition from the industry has been high in the last five years. In 1990, about 1.2&#13;
million (on average) workers were employed in the coal industry. In 1995, total employment dropped&#13;
to 1.0 million (on average). In the same period, total employment in coal extraction decreased by 14&#13;
percent from 724,000 to 620,000 (Table 2.1). Due to problems of chronic back-wages, aging mines,&#13;
poor physical conditions and general low morale, people are leaving the mines -- the employable&#13;
ones. Table 2.2 below shows the composition of the coal industry workforce in 1994 and 1995.&#13;

Between 1994-95 total employment in the coal industry declined by 75,000 workers (on&#13;
average) or 8.1 percent. In the same period, the number of employees working directly in coal&#13;
production decreased by 8.5 percent or 68,578 workers (on average) .&#13;
2.16   In coal extraction, employment categories that experienced the greatest attrition/departures&#13;
were breakage face-workers (15 percent) and tunnellers (14.5 percent). Typically, these two&#13;
categories of miners include the largest number of young men under 40 years of age5. At the same&#13;
time, the production workers employed in bricketting show the lowest exit rate at 1.4 percent. This&#13;
group of workers is typically the smallest among the employees working directly in coal production.&#13;
However, their production for household heating needs is in high demand. In services (the so-called&#13;
"non-productive sphere") employment decreased at a rate of 5.6 percent (on average).&#13;
2.17   While there is a need for specific measures to mitigate the social impacts of restructuring, the&#13;
design of the measures needs to take into account macroeconomic and fiscal realities. The&#13;
Government can no longer afford to subsidize the industry by supporting money-losing mines. Old&#13;
mines (of which there are more than seventy) are incurring losses of $3-5 million per year on&#13;
average. This is a cost (direct or implicit) to the budget of some $300 million per year or about 0.5&#13;
percent of GDP.&#13;
2.18   Continued natural attrition should be the main method of job reduction. Based on the above&#13;
employment statistics, it appears feasible that many face workers could be redeployed at other mines,&#13;
5/ Data on coal mines of Ukraine collected by Agency for Regional Development in Donetsk.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
provided that new recruitment is halted. There are likely to be additional costs of transferring&#13;
employees from one place of work to another, especially if the hiring mine is distant from the closing&#13;
mine.&#13;
2.19   However, many surface workers, especially women, are likely to become redundant. The&#13;
potential loss of employment in certain regions presents a fundamental concern. The most effective&#13;
measures to counter this threat are those that promise to help, over time, restore economy-wide&#13;
growth (i.e. further reduction of the budget deficit, monetary stability, liberalized trade regime,&#13;
transparent, predictable legal and regulatory framework, and promotion of the private sector). State-&#13;
imposed obstacles to labor mobility such as the propiska (a requirement that in order to reside in a&#13;
location one needs to obtain a permit based on having a job) should be removed. These measures can&#13;
help foster regional as well as national growth.&#13;
2.20   In the interim, special assistance efforts will be required to mitigate adverse labor and social&#13;
impacts, especially in the coal regions. Among the options to facilitate the expansion of employment&#13;
are: (a) public employment schemes to help the long-term unemployed; (b) cash incentives to firms to&#13;
hire ex-miners; (c) provision of credit for new business ventures; and (d) retraining programs for&#13;
displaced workers. Such measures would be essential, but it is also important to recognize that the&#13;
communities surrounding old mines typically have a high proportion of older workers and pensioners.&#13;
To the extent that they have been able, many of the younger people have left the area. Those&#13;
remaining are usually the more risk-averse, and thus generally less marketable employees.&#13;
2.21   In order to maximize the effectiveness of retraining programs, the workers will be able to&#13;
choose for themselves the kind of training they wish to receive, and to choose the kind of institution&#13;
(state or private) from which they wish to receive the training. Vouchers would be issued to ex-mine&#13;
workers (from the 3 mines under the Pilot Project) eligible for training. The vouchers would have&#13;
value, and eligible workers could "spend" them at State-run programs at private firms or institutes.&#13;
In effect, workers would "buy" the training they wanted. Both State and private schools would accept&#13;
vouchers in payment for training, and they would then receive reimbursement from the Employment&#13;
Fund. This would create competition among schools to offer programs that workers really want, and&#13;
new providers of training programs are likely to emerge to help meet the demand. Those institutes&#13;
that offer courses which trainees want, that teach courses well, and that help find jobs for trainees at&#13;
the conclusion of the training courses, would grow and expand.&#13;
2.22   In the past, the State made projections about labor market needs, 5 or 8 years in advance and&#13;
offered courses in professions that it believed would have been in demand in the coming year. This&#13;
centralized "manpower planning" approach has not succeeded in other countries, and most countries&#13;
outside the FSU and Eastern Europe have abandoned it. Experience shows that in a dynamic&#13;
economy, the State is not capable of guessing correctly what professions will be in future demand.&#13;
Individual workers making thousands of individual decisions can provide a dynamic economy with&#13;
much greater flexibility than centralized State decisions. The private sector is likely to account for&#13;
most future job growth in Ukraine, so the training that workers are likely to seek will be for jobs in&#13;
the private sector, rather than in the state enterprise sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
E. Social Protection&#13;
2.23   The mine workers and their unions have stressed the need for adequate provision for social&#13;
protection of the workers. They believe any mine closure program must provide for coal distributions&#13;
and payments for compensation of damage6 to be continued from the national budget, rather than&#13;
from the associations or mines. The length of the mines' housing waiting lists (5 years on average) is&#13;
such that most workers are not likely to receive apartments; yet workers are nearly all housed, often&#13;
by doubling up. School facilities, profilactoria, sanatoria, and rest houses have traditionally been&#13;
provided by the mining associates. Union leaders have expressed concern that if these facilities are&#13;
transferred to municipal authorities without adequate planning, workers might no longer obtain access.&#13;
2.24   Up to one-third of the residents in some towns are pensioners. The retirement pensions for&#13;
mine workers are paid from a fund maintained by the city, with revenues received from payroll&#13;
deductions from mine enterprises. These revenues have essentially stopped, and some of the cities&#13;
are out of money in their pension funds. They have been receiving help from the oblast level pension&#13;
funds, but these too are being exhausted. Continuation of pension payments for retirees would&#13;
therefore be an important social protection measure, but as part of the national system of pensions and&#13;
social protection. As is often the case, older people on pensions and women appear to be among the&#13;
most vulnerable groups. Women occupy primarily clerical and administrative jobs connected with the&#13;
mines, and their reemployment possibilities are more limited. Another important feature of the social&#13;
protection system is the delivery of free coal to workers and pensioners associated with a given mine.&#13;
This heating subsidy is an important mitigation measure in the short-term.&#13;
F. Budgetary Support&#13;
2.25   The support for the coal industry was equivalent to 8.3 percent of total budgetary&#13;
expenditures, or about 4 percent of GDP in 1993, and 5.6 percent of budget expenditures or 3 percent&#13;
of GDP in 1994 (without taking into account household price subsidies but including credit&#13;
provided/guaranteed by the budget). In the revised budget adopted in mid-1995, Krb 20 trillion or&#13;
US$ 130 million equivalent of production/investment subsidies were allocated to the coal industry,&#13;
equivalent to less than 1 percent of GDP in 1995.&#13;
2.26   In view of the critical situation of the Ukrainian coal industry, most of the cost of&#13;
restructuring has to be borne by the national budget. However, it is important to channel budgetary&#13;
support in a way that minimizes the risk of distorting decisions about future production activities and&#13;
investments. In other words, the market rather than the government should decide allocation of&#13;
resources for coal production. This can be achieved if budgetary support is primarily aimed at&#13;
relieving the industry of unproductive expenditures.&#13;
2.27   Budgetary resources that support the operation and maintenance of social infrastructure should&#13;
be provided to the local governments. Assuming that (i) support from the central government budget&#13;
is gradually reduced over time; and (ii) cost savings from rationalization and privatization proceeds&#13;
are fully utilized to finance the rehabilitation of remaining assets, about US$130 million support from&#13;
6/ Under Ukrainian law, if an enterprise is liquidated, payment for damage to workers ("disability" payments) is to be&#13;
continued by the legal successor, the association or its successor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
the central government needs to be budgeted for 1996, US$90 million for 1997, and US$45 million&#13;
for 1998. Additional resources need to be provided to regions/cities where major job losses occur for&#13;
the retraining of workers and the establishment of funds that facilitate job creation (credit lines and&#13;
public employment programs). The necessary budgetary outlay for this purpose is estimated at&#13;
US$20 million per year.&#13;
2.28   All other budgetary support for restructuring should be channeled through the UDKR.&#13;
Assuming that, on average, about 15 mines will be closed annually in the 1996-2000 period, the&#13;
budget of the UDKR should be about US$130 million per year, consisting of US$50 million per year&#13;
to cover technical closure costs, US$15 million per year to cover environmental protection costs,&#13;
US$15 million per year for payments to cover the cost of transferring employees from the closing&#13;
mines to other mines, US$25 million per year for severance pay to workers who do not wish (or&#13;
cannot be) to be transferred; and US$25 million per year for disability payments and the provision of&#13;
coal to pensioners. The current Budget includes the following items for the coal industry: (i) Krb 51&#13;
trillion for technical reconstruction of the mines; (ii) Krb 27 trillion for mine closure and mitigation&#13;
of the social problems; and (iii) Krb 25 trillion for divestiture of social assets (industry-wide, not only&#13;
for the coal sector). This amounts to Krb 103 trillion or $570 million.&#13;
G. The Need for Effective Public Participation&#13;
2.29   Participation by affected parties ("stakeholders") is critical to help plan, refine and implement&#13;
the most effective strategy for closing individual mines and for restructuring the sector. Stakeholders&#13;
include managers in the coal industry, mine workers and families, pensioners, municipalities, the&#13;
Government of Ukraine, the UDKR, and political leaders at all levels. Each of these groups has a&#13;
stake in the design and implementation of the restructuring efforts as well as the social and&#13;
environmental impact.&#13;
2.30   Issues affecting coal mines and miners are politically very sensitive. For decades, miners of&#13;
the Donbas region were the mainstay of Soviet labor. In recent years, with the independence from&#13;
the Soviet Union and the shocks to the Ukrainian economy, the Donbas region went into severe&#13;
recession. Workers were often unpaid for months at a time, which made the task of consultation even&#13;
more difficult.&#13;
2.31   Over the past few years, there have been several labor marches on Kiev, organized by coal&#13;
union management seeking higher wages, payment of back-wages, and indexation of wages. At&#13;
times, these actions have resulted in the emission of credits for payment of back-wages. During a&#13;
large strike in February 1996, stoppages occurred at about 100 mines. Wage payments continue to be&#13;
late (34 months on average), although work stoppages have declined.&#13;
2.32   Although it is generally accepted that the mines slated for closure are at the end of their&#13;
economic lives, until recently there has not been a clear view among the Ministry of Coal Industry&#13;
and industry or the mine managers as to what should be done to offset the social impact of closure.&#13;
In the absence of a clear sectoral strategy and an effective public information program, many workers&#13;
believe that better management or new technologies will save their mines and thus their jobs. They&#13;
find it difficult to accept that the problems with the mines are severe and systemic, and to accept the&#13;
implication of this on their ability to keep their jobs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
2.33   Consultation with the miners and the unions has begun in earnest with the coal conference&#13;
held in Kiev in April 1996, and several local meetings at the three locations included in the project.&#13;
A number of union leaders are open-minded, realizing that change has to come. The Government is&#13;
involving both the oblast and the municipal authorities closely, with a view to facilitating the effective&#13;
transfer of social assets.&#13;
2.34   Those affected by the planned mine closures, including individual workers, unions, municipal&#13;
officials, and mine managers, need to be involved in the planning and implementation phases. Lack&#13;
of involvement and ownership could lead to misunderstanding and resistance. Thus, improving the&#13;
two-way information flow is a priority. Experience in other countries has shown that mine managers&#13;
and workers who have participated in designing the program, and feel some ownership of it, are&#13;
likely to be more helpful in implementing it. Thus, the interested parties will be given full&#13;
information, and will be encouraged to participate in the monitoring and evaluation of the Pilot&#13;
Project as it is implemented.&#13;
III. PROJECT DESCRIPTION, COSTS ESTIMATES, AND FINANCING&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
3.1    The central objective of the project is to mitigate the social and environmental consequences&#13;
that arise from the Government's decision to close uneconomic coal mines, as part of Government's&#13;
overall restructuring program for the coal sector. The project seeks to: (i) test ways to implement the&#13;
Government's decision to close mines safely, with due regard to technical, environmental, economic,&#13;
financial and social aspects; (ii) ensure that mine workers are afforded opportunities to either transfer&#13;
to other jobs in the sector or exit the industry with reasonable compensation and a choice of assistance&#13;
for seeking other employment; (iii) transfer social assets to municipal management; support their&#13;
rationalization and help ensure that adequate social protection measures are put in place to support the&#13;
most vulnerable affected people; and (iv) through monitoring and feedback, gain experience from the&#13;
project for subsequent Bank assistance operations in the sector.&#13;
B. Selection Criteria&#13;
3.2    The three mines for the pilot project were selected based upon the following criteria: the&#13;
mines should present a mix of issues that the UDKR will face in closing other mines, i.e. simple&#13;
versus complex; different parts of the coal basin with different mining technologies and coal markets;&#13;
single industry town versus diverse town; and readiness of plans for closure. All three mines are&#13;
uneconomic, each is located in the Donetsk Oblast (which provides administrative simplicity) and all&#13;
three are considered by MCI and the Donetsk Oblast to be top priority for closure. The&#13;
characteristics of the mines are summarized in Table 3.1 and are discussed in Annexes 3-5.&#13;

C. Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
3.3     Table 3.2 summarizes the project costs. The financing plan (Table 3.3) shows that the&#13;
proposed Bank loan of $15.8 million would finance 55 percent of total project costs estimated at&#13;
$28.5 million; 100 % of foreign costs (of $2.4 million) and 51% of local costs. Proceeds of the loan&#13;
would be passed onto the UDKR to handle the physical closure of mines, including measures to&#13;
improve the surrounding environment. For the divestiture of social infrastructure, the funds would be&#13;
passed on by the National Government (Ministry of Finance) via the Donetsk Oblast to the municipal&#13;
administrations, upon certification of the incremental net operating costs of the transferred facilities.&#13;
Counterpart funds would be provided by the national Government (for such items as meeting&#13;
disability payments, retirement and other social benefits) and by the municipalities (in the form of&#13;
support for social infrastructure). The Government's share of the total costs is estimated at 40&#13;
percent. Bilateral grants are being sought to fund the technical assistance components.&#13;

D. Project Components&#13;
3.4    There are five project components, which would serve as the basic framework for mitigation&#13;
initiatives in subsequent sector operations requested by the Government. These are:&#13;
1 .    Mitigation of Mine Closure&#13;
(a) physical closure&#13;
(b) environmental mitigation&#13;
2.     Social mitigation&#13;
3.     Social infrastructure divestiture&#13;
4.    Institutional strengthening and job counselling&#13;
5.    Technical assistance&#13;
Each of these components is summarized below.&#13;
3.5    Closure Plan. The key aspects of the closure plans for the three mines are outlined in Box&#13;
4.1. These plans would include mitigation of physical, environmental and social aspects. Adoption&#13;
of a specific plan for each mine would be a condition of disbursement for physical works at that mine&#13;
(para 6.4 (i)). These aspects are discussed below.&#13;
1. Mitigation of Mine Closure&#13;
A. Physical Closure&#13;
3.6    This component involves carrying out civil works and procurement of equipment to enable&#13;
safe mine closures (including filling and capping of shafts, demolition of surface buildings, limited&#13;
regrading, and pumping of water where necessary).&#13;
3.7    The three mines are simple with few technical closure problems and with low gas levels in the&#13;
general body of mine air (0.3 to 0.5%). The shaft fill could be obtained from the spoil tips or&#13;
processed rubble from the surface demolition. The shafts are 50-100 years old. All three mines have&#13;
been poorly maintained. They have small and simple surface installations with no substantial&#13;
structures. The winding gear and head stocks are made of brick and steel construction, and are&#13;
similar in scale to those at the smallest mines in Western Europe. Little preparation work is required&#13;
before filling and capping of the shafts.&#13;
3.8    The project will finance the purchase of equipment necessary to effect closure at the three&#13;
mines, and an allowance for non-productive operation of support systems (e.g. pumps, ventilation,&#13;
and shaft hoists) during the shaft preparation and filling period.&#13;
3.9    The physical mine closing would occur in four stages:&#13;
Stage 1: The closure is designed. This step has been essentially completed for all three&#13;
mines.&#13;
Stage 2: Coal production is arrested and men and equipment (to the extent economically&#13;
justified) are removed from underground. This stage is on-going. It ends on the&#13;
closure date (full cessation of these activities).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
Stage 3: Shafts are filled and capped, and surface buildings demolished. This stage begins&#13;
immediately after the closure date and should be completed 6 months later.&#13;
Stage 4: The environmental impact of the closure is monitored and further mitigated as&#13;
required. This stage may include water and methane gas monitoring and re-shaping&#13;
and revegitation of spoil heaps. There is no time limit to this stage.&#13;
3.10   The total cost of physical closure at the three mines is estimated at $9.1 million, which is&#13;
about equal to what was incurred in the U.K., France, and Belgium ($3 million per mine). The&#13;
estimates have been lowered from the original Ukrainian plans by adopting a "fast track" approach&#13;
that does not provide for much salvage of dilapidated equipment and materials. Most of the machinery&#13;
and rail equipment underground is in very poor condition and does not warrant being reclaimed. The&#13;
main electrical machinery is serviceable and, if appropriate economically, will be salvaged and&#13;
deployed in other mines.&#13;
B. Environmental Mitigation&#13;
3.11   The project is rated "B". A check list of guidelines for preparation of the environmental&#13;
mitigatior; plans for the mines has been formulated (Annex 6). These guidelines are broad in&#13;
coverage and much of it could usefully apply to the sector as a whole. After approval of the physical&#13;
closure plan by the Donetsk Oblast Department of Environment, an Enviromnental Management Plan&#13;
(EMP) with site-specific mitigation measures would be prepared, with technical assistance to be&#13;
financed by grant funding. The EMP will identify the site specific environmental issues associated&#13;
with the physical closure plan, mitigating measures, and a monitoring program to assure compliance&#13;
with the mitigation program. In addition, institutional responsibilities will be identified for&#13;
implementation of both mitigation and inventory programs respectively, as well as associated costs. It&#13;
has been estimated that US$100,000 would be required to implement the EMP, and this amount has&#13;
been included in the project cost. Implementation of the physical closure plan is contingent upon&#13;
Bank approval of the EMP.&#13;
3.12   The closure of the three mines should not increase the environmental problems of the coal&#13;
fields, and would in fact avoid additional pollution associated with ongoing mine operations.&#13;
Pertinent issues are: (a) safety risks posed by abandoned shafts and audits; (b) safety risks and visual&#13;
annoyance posed by decrepit industrial structures on the mine's surface; (c) fumes from smoldering&#13;
fires in one of the waste piles (at Removskaya mine in Snezhnoye); (d) safety risks from methane gas&#13;
escaping from old mine workings (mainly at Krasniy Oktyabr mine in Yenakievo, though to a lesser&#13;
degree also at Pravda mine in Donetsk); (e) possible land subsidence (minor shifts in land levels) after&#13;
the mine's closure; (f) rock waste dumps occupy potentially usable land and are considered to be an&#13;
eyesore; (g) the tailings pond from the washery at the Removskaya mine could have affected the&#13;
surface and subsurface water quality; and (h) minor groundwater pollution may have occurred because&#13;
of improper disposal of oil and grease from workshops associated with the mine.&#13;
3.13   At the Krasniy Oktyabr and the Pravda mines, there exists a limited risk of gas seepage from&#13;
the abandoned mine workings to the surface after mine closure. The design institutes are aware of this&#13;
risk and have carefully identified all possible areas where such seepage could occur. These areas will&#13;
be monitored in the post-closure period. Should seepage occur, the safety risks can be mitigated by&#13;
drilling gas release boreholes, in line with international practice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
3.14   The environmental management plans will provide, inter alia, for the following mitigation&#13;
measures: all shafts and openings will be filled with rock and permanently sealed off at the surface;&#13;
unsafe industrial surface structures will be levelled, and rubble and scrap removed; ground water will&#13;
pumped; and the fire at Removskaya will be extinguished. After closure, the sites will be monitored&#13;
for methane emissions and ground subsidence. Under the project, technical assistance will be&#13;
provided for possible longer term environmental improvements, such as improving the slopes of&#13;
terracones and examining whether the sites could be used for alterative purposes for future use, and&#13;
for remediating any surface or ground-water impacts if needed. The costs of such mitigation&#13;
measures would be borne by UDKR.&#13;
2. Social Mitigation&#13;
3.15   The social mitigation package under the project consists of the following measures:&#13;
(a)    Severance payments, pension payments. disability payments, unemployment benefits,&#13;
and other social protection benefits to be provided by the GOU in accordance with&#13;
current Ukrainian laws (see para 3.23);&#13;
(b)    Re-employment support would be offered for workers in closing mines (para 3.24 -&#13;
3.31);&#13;
(c)    Micro-credit funded by the Bank loan through an appropriate agency selected by the&#13;
GOU on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The agency would make&#13;
small sub-loans available to entrepreneurs, to be lent at interest rates that takes into&#13;
account the National Bank of Ukraine discount rate. This program would be managed&#13;
by a suitable agency in accordance with an agency agreement between the agency and&#13;
the Government: the agency agreement would contain terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank under which the agency would lend small loans to enterprises&#13;
or individuals who present sound business plans for investment and working capital in&#13;
the region of mine closures. Applicants for subloans could be former coal mine&#13;
employees, as well as other persons in the area of the mining communities who are&#13;
setting up small businesses (paras 3.32 - 3.38);&#13;
(d)    Public works. Assistance would be provided in carrying out a small public works&#13;
program to be undertaken by the municipalities in which the three mines are located&#13;
($70,000 per city). Such works could include repair of roads, communal services,&#13;
and environmental improvements at the project sites or the adjacent towns (Annexes&#13;
3-5 provide more information on site-specifics). During the Project Launch&#13;
Workshop mission, the Donetsk Oblast (and the municipalities) is expected to submit a&#13;
plan of the criteria for selection of the public works for enviromental improvements in&#13;
the areas affected by the project.&#13;
3.16  In order to design the package, the profile of the workers had to be obtained. Mine workers&#13;
fall into four main categories, though these could be further subdivided:&#13;
*     underground skilled workers who work the face of the coal seam;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
*      other underground workers, including tunnellers, drifters, transport and service&#13;
personnel;&#13;
*      surface workers associated with the mine operation (technical and administrative); and&#13;
*      workers associated with other operations supported by the coal industry, such as&#13;
housing, kindergartens, and other social infrastructure.&#13;
3.17   There is demand for some of the underground workers at other mines. The housing and&#13;
kindergarten workers would be transferred to the municipalities, along with the social infrastructure&#13;
they service, and thus would be employed for at least part of the time. Surface workers face the most&#13;
difficulty in seeking new employment and many of them are women. They are engaged in office&#13;
work and mine maintenance, but are not directly linked to production.&#13;
3.18   To arrive at an appropriate design for, and to estimate the cost of social mitigation measures,&#13;
it was necessary to estimate the projected unemployment from the closure of the three pilot mines.&#13;
To do this, the employees were disaggregated into four risk groups as shown in Table 3.4 and in&#13;
Annex 8. The "highest risk" and "high risk" categories include the surface workers, divided&#13;
according to occupation and reliance on a single income (women, single heads of households with&#13;
children). The "at risk" and "at risk - mobile" categories include underground workers, divided&#13;
according to occupation and perceived demand at other mines.&#13;

This table, taken from data/interviews at Removskaya mine, provides estimated unemployment during two years into the&#13;
closure period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
3.19    Fifty-three interviews were conducted with workers in each of the four risk categories at each&#13;
mine. In addition, interviews were conducted with local offices of the Employment Service, mine&#13;
managers, labor unions, and local and regional government officials.&#13;
3.20    There is no clear consensus on how many workers will be able to find new jobs in the next&#13;
two to three years. The scenarios presented in Table 3.4 represent a range of possible unemployment&#13;
outcomes six months to two years after mine closure. It may be that the three mines in the pilot will&#13;
correspond to some extent with the three risk scenarios presented: i.e. Donetsk (Pravda mine) is&#13;
likely to be the best case, while Snezhnoye (Removskaya mine) is likely to be close to the most&#13;
difficult case7. For the purpose of cost projections, the middle case was used. Close monitoring of&#13;
re-employment outcomes during the Pilot Project will provide valuable information for planning&#13;
subsequent operations.&#13;
3.21    A fundamental problem common to all FSU countries is the lack of labor mobility. This is&#13;
particularly severe in the coal sector, where most of these workers are deeply identified with their&#13;
community. They and members of their families have sometimes lived in these settlements and&#13;
worked at the mines for generations. They are dependent on the mines not only for employment, but&#13;
also for coal and other forms of social protection. Few of the workers have any clear idea as to how&#13;
or where to look for a new job, let alone start any kind of small business. They have no real&#13;
experience of a market economy, and little concept of alternatives. They hope that if the mines are&#13;
closed, the Government will start new mines or some other enterprise to employ them. The towns of&#13;
Yenakievo and Snezhnoye (60 - 100 km from Donetsk) are physically and economically remote,&#13;
aggravating the lack of labor mobility.&#13;
3.22    Consequently, the most important feature in the project revolves around the social protection&#13;
package for the workers. Measures are geared towards assisting affected workers to find alternative&#13;
employment and meet their basic living needs. Thus, the package designed for the 3-mine Pilot goes&#13;
well beyond the significance of only this project. It tests a model of how the balance between fiscal&#13;
affordability and social justice could be achieved and handled in the future.&#13;
3.23    Under the project, all benefits due to workers under the law would be met by the&#13;
Government. Redundant miners and other workers at the mines are entitled to the following benefits&#13;
under the laws of Ukraine:8&#13;
7/ The city of Snezhnoye's economy is overwhelmingly dependent on its mines, including the Removskaya mine. The&#13;
miries have historically employed generations of workers and multiple wage-earners in a single household. Snezhnoye is&#13;
remote (2-hour ride from Donetsk) and has poor roads and occasional public transport between mine settlements surrounding&#13;
the city. The manager at the Removskaya mine estimates that only 200 to 250 of his most skilled underground workers can&#13;
be redeployed to other mines. By contrast, the city of Donetsk, where the Pravda mines are located, offers better prospects.&#13;
Over the past 18 months, according to independent trade union officials at the mine, half the employees have left&#13;
voluntarily. The director of the mine estimates that 45 to 50% of those remaining can be reabsorbed in the industry. At&#13;
least 5 to 10% more will likely find work in or near Donetsk. The city of Yenakievo, where Krasniy Oktyabr is located,&#13;
falls between these two extremes. It is a 90-minute ride from Donetsk and is more economically diverse than Snezhnoye.&#13;
8/ These benefits, in principle, are available to all workers who become unemployed. However, few are receiving them,&#13;
according to official data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
*     Severance Pay. For the first 3 months of unemployment, laid-off workers will&#13;
receive severance pay at the rate equal to their previous monthly salary. The&#13;
severance payments will commence on date of termination.&#13;
*     Unemployment Benefits. After the first 3 months of unemployment, those actively&#13;
seeking work will receive unemployment benefits for 9 months. Unemployment&#13;
benefits are equal to 75% of their average wage and reduced to 50% after the second&#13;
3 months of unemployment. Those laid-off miners with less than two years before&#13;
retirement age, will receive unemployment benefits for 15 months. Unemployment&#13;
benefits are covered from the national fund financed from a 2% payroll tax. The&#13;
benefits are not paid to those with pension or other income exceeding the minimum&#13;
wage.&#13;
3.24   Under the project, job creation incentives equivalent to expenditures of $600/worker will be&#13;
included for ex-miners and other workers associated with the three mines who find jobs with private&#13;
finns, or who undertake their own jobs through setting up new economic activities. The type of jobs&#13;
that have been typically created in coal mining regions in other countries are construction, auto&#13;
repair, electrical repairs, bakeries, small flour mills, etc. These jobs utilize skills found among&#13;
miners and surface workers and, with some retraining, workers have proven to be able to find jobs.&#13;
What is needed, however, is the active partnership of the Donetsk Oblast and the three municipalities&#13;
in designing job creation schemes. The Oblast and the municipalities have agreed to jointly work out,&#13;
with the help of UDKR, a job creation program for ex-mine workers. The project will test different&#13;
approaches/solutions with the central premise that all jobs need to be: (i) competitive in the&#13;
marketplace; (ii) outside existing state enterprises; and (iii) outside existing mines, as there is excess&#13;
labor in those mines (other than face workers).&#13;
3.25   The job creation would take the form of re-employment support payments made directly to&#13;
new or existing employers of ex-mine workers. Payments would be made to employers (not other&#13;
mines) who hire workers who have been laid-off at the 3 mines, or those who have exited from those&#13;
mines to launch self-employment activities, or who have undertaken training programs.&#13;
3.26   Annex 7 presents data obtained by the Agency for Regional Development and Social Studies&#13;
of Donetsk; the report is entitled "Social Portrait of a Miner". It collaborates a similar report&#13;
conducted by the Russian Institute of Comparative Labor Relations entitled "Residents of Miners'&#13;
Settlements and Problems of Coal Sector Restructuring". Both reports show unemployment to be&#13;
much higher than the number registered with the official Employment Service. Only a small&#13;
percentage of those unemployed seem to seek work through official channels. Women appear to be&#13;
much harder hit by unemployment than men, because they work primarily as middle managers,&#13;
administrators, and accountants, rather than directly in the mines. While some miners can transfer to&#13;
a new mine, administrative jobs do not usually transfer when a mine is closed.&#13;

3.27   Only 4% of the Russian workers surveyed (and only 2% of the miners) indicated they would&#13;
like to set up their own businesses. As revealed in rapid assessments recently done in Ukraine, this&#13;
lack of entrepreneurial inclination is also typical of mine workers in Ukraine. It was a significant&#13;
issue even in Great Britain, where the commercial and legal infrastructure to support small businesses&#13;
is well-developed. The Russian survey showed that being in "business" carries a significant stigma to&#13;
the miners (74% of those interviewed in Kiselovsk indicated they would never engage in business&#13;
under any circumstances), especially among older people. This stigma, added to a lack of supporting&#13;
infrastructure, poses a significant barrier to new business creation.&#13;
3.28   Job Creation Potential at the Regional Level. The project is focused upon the Donetsk Oblast&#13;
for several reasons: (i) it is the traditional center of the donbas coal mining region; (ii) the Oblast&#13;
ranks among the top in terms of small-scale privatizations achieved in 1995, as shown below, and is&#13;
consequently seen as a region that will actively seek to absorb workers from the mining industry into&#13;
other economic activities; and (iii) it is the location of more than a dozen coal mines that need to be&#13;
closed over the next few years and therefore the Oblast Government has taken a pro-active stance in&#13;
assisting the restructuring of the industry.&#13;
3.29    The ability of the regional economy to absorb employees who leave the coal industry or are&#13;
made redundant through closings and consolidates, will be particularly dependent on the progress of&#13;
reforms in the Donetsk, Lugansk, Volyn and Dniepropetrovsk oblasts, where most of the mines are&#13;
located. Tables 3.5 and 3.6 below show the comparative experience of four oblasts (as well as&#13;
nationally) in assisting privatizations and in attracting foreign investment.&#13;
The number of privatized units has increased more rapidly and the pace quickened faster in&#13;
the Donetsk oblast than in the three other oblasts mentioned.&#13;

3.30   Small scale businesses have been growing quite rapidly in the Donetsk region. At the end of&#13;
1993, there were 10,000 such units (defined as up to 200 employees for industry and 25 employees&#13;
for non-industrial activities, and 15 employees in the case of retail trade) employing 134,700 people.&#13;
By October 1995, the number of units had grown to 11,900 employing 130,000 persons (average&#13;
number of employees equals 12).&#13;

3.31   Despite good progress in 1995, there is much scope to speed up both private sector&#13;
development and privatization in Donetsk city and in the surrounding towns. Current policy does&#13;
encourage the establishment of new businesses, and the Oblast Government has begun a campaign to&#13;
stress that those previously engaged in coal mining could find alternative economic activities if micro&#13;
credit were made available. The Oblast Government maintains a Market Relations Development&#13;
Division within its Economic Department, one of whose functions is to assist small businesses in&#13;
registration and start-up; it provides information on procedures and facilitates new ventures.&#13;
3.32   In Donetsk Oblast, as in most of Ukraine, one obstacle cited by people wishing to establish&#13;
small businesses is that it is very difficult to comply with official registration procedures. Having&#13;
done so, small firms find it virtually impossible to get credit. Tax rates can stifle reinvestment of&#13;
eamings. One proven means of creating jobs and earnings for poor people, particularly women, is to&#13;
facilitate micro-enterprise development. This can be done through provision of carefully supervised&#13;
micro-credit, and by making the establishment of micro-enterprises a simple and fair procedure.&#13;
3.33   The Donetsk Oblast has developed a record of pro-active support or encouragement of private&#13;
businesses. The Oblast plans to create "one-stop shops" where micro-businesses can quickly be&#13;
registered, and basic information useful to businesses could be given out. Initially, three such&#13;
"shops" would be established in the vicinity of the closing mines. Simplification of inspection&#13;
procedures (such as for fire and health safety standards), and reduction of the required frequency of&#13;
permit renewal is being undertaken in tandem. Currently, small commercial establishments can be&#13;
subject to several inspections a month, and be required monthly to renew permits to sell certain&#13;
products. To help meet the impact of closures, the three municipalities are all establishing "business-&#13;
friendly environments" that could utilize the skills of ex-miners.&#13;
3.34   The Bank loan would help to cover the initial funding for micro-credit lending to small&#13;
businesses and entrepreneurial activities in the project areas. The program would enable applicants to&#13;
receive loans, if they provide business plans with sound financial prospects. Assistance in drawing up&#13;
the business plans, and supervision of the loans, would be provided by a suitable lending agency.&#13;
The business plans would not need to be as detailed as those used by the Business Development&#13;
Office in Luhansk supported by IFC and the U.K. Know-How Fund for larger business loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
Provision would be made for cross-fertilization between the Project's offices and the IFC/U.K. Know-&#13;
How Fund office in Luhansk. The micro-credit loans would not be limited to ex-mine employees, but&#13;
would be open to all applicants in the three local communities.&#13;
3.35   Criteria for Selecting a Suitable Micro-credit Agencv. Two possibilities exist for providing&#13;
the micro-credit financing:&#13;
(i)    using a financial institution that already exists in Ukraine with experience in providing&#13;
such credits; the institution might need a small amount of technical assistance to&#13;
deliver such specialized operations; or&#13;
(ii)   using a non-governmental institution (NGO) with such experience. A few such NGOs&#13;
are active in Ukraine (e.g Western NIS-Fund that is accredited to lend), but&#13;
experience is limited and little has been lent in the small-scale area. The agency would&#13;
need to asses the commercial and economic viability of applicants and be able to&#13;
monitor the use of any credits. In some FSU countries, the NGOs have teamed up&#13;
with partner banks to perform the financial transactions.&#13;
3.36   Whichever the type used, the microcredit agency would need to be able to demonstrate that it&#13;
can meet the following performance standards:&#13;
*     a good financial standing as well as performance without losses or subsidies (i.e have&#13;
a viable credit portfolio) and be able to extend loans at interest rates that cover the&#13;
administrative and financial costs of credit;&#13;
*     capacity to do business planning, including provision of micro-credit services in the&#13;
Donetsk Oblast and the marketing of such services;&#13;
*     capacity to expand its micro-credit services, including to maintain ability to supervise&#13;
and check progress in making credit, appropriate system of operations, management&#13;
operations system, financial flexibility and capacity to quickly make decisions on&#13;
providing microfinancing;&#13;
*     experience in delivering small loans to small-scale businesses, especially new entrants,&#13;
including providing credits on the basis of business plans, evaluation of cash flows,&#13;
and project proposals, and using collateral (through partner banks if need be) to cover&#13;
credit risk.&#13;
3.37   These criteria were discussed during negotiations. It was agreed that the interest rate payable&#13;
by the individual borrowers should be determined in accordance with GOU's financial policy, and&#13;
take into account the National Bank of Ukraine discount rate (currently 75 percent per annum, having&#13;
been lowered from 90 percent on April 1, 1996 and 85 percent on April 8, 1996) and the&#13;
administrative costs and lending risk.&#13;
3.38   Regarding the demand for credit, it is likely that over the three years of the project&#13;
implementation, some 400 small loans of around $5,000 each could be extended, or an amount of $2&#13;
million. This has been included in the Bank loan amount and would be treated as seed capital for a&#13;
revolving fund which over the life of the Bank loan could benefit many more than the initial 400 sub-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
borrowers (assuming sub-loan maturities of say 3 years). Other terms and conditions of the on-&#13;
lending, and selection criteria, would be developed in conjuction with the selection of the fiscal agent.&#13;
Conclusion of a satisfactory Fiscal Agency Agreement, as well as agreement on eligibility criteria,&#13;
would be a condition of disbursement of this component of the Bank loan (para 6.4 (iii)).&#13;
3. Social Infrastructure Divestiture and Heating Subsidy&#13;
3.39   Divestiture of social infrastructure would involve financing of additional expenses incurred by&#13;
municipalities for taking over operation and maintenance of housing, kindergartens and other social&#13;
assets from the three closing mines. Such expenditures would be supported by the Bank loan (under&#13;
the Project) on a declining scale over the next three years. For the first year, the support would be&#13;
75% of net expenditures, for the second year 50%, and for the third year 25%. Annex 9 shows the&#13;
financial data for the social facilities at the 3 mines and the impact on the three municipal budgets in&#13;
question.&#13;
3.40   The estimated financing for the housing component by the Bank loan (under the Project) is&#13;
approximately $0.9 million under a three year sliding scale. Housing waiting lists of the mines to be&#13;
closed would be merged with the housing waiting lists of the appropriate municipal authorities (the&#13;
cities of Yenakievo and Snezhnoye and the Proletarsky Raion of Donetsk).&#13;
3.41   The project would include financing for a portion of the operating costs of the nine&#13;
kindergartens, cultural facilities, sports facilities, and profilactoria that are currently operated by the&#13;
three mines in the Pilot Project. These are considered essential services to the community and should&#13;
continue to operate during the transitional period. Under the Project, and in accord with national&#13;
policy, the social facilities would be transferred to the municipalities, who will have full responsibility&#13;
for their operation and maintenance. There is an evident scope for making these facilities more&#13;
efficient with higher enrollment rates (fewer facilities). The project would finance a sliding scale of&#13;
current outlays (75 percent of net operating costs less user fees in the first year, 50 percent in the&#13;
second year, and 25 percent in the third year). The municipalities will need to implement a program&#13;
of rationalization to reduce the operating costs and achieve greater cost recovery and to bring the&#13;
transferred social facilities in line with municipal standards. The estimated total financing for the&#13;
other social infrastructure is approximately $300,000, under the same three year sliding scale.&#13;
3.42   For the towns of Yenakievo and Snezhnoye, the city administration would be responsible for&#13;
transferred social assets. For the city of Donetsk, which is divided into raions, the Proletarsky Raion&#13;
would be responsible (except for housing, which would be managed by the city of Donetsk). The&#13;
Govermnent would reimburse these municipal authorities for a portion of their increased operating&#13;
costs resulting from this transfer (less revenues from user fees). The declining reimbursement scale&#13;
provides time and incentive for: (i) rationalization of operations; and (ii) increases in user fees to cost-&#13;
recovery levels (taking into account the Government's targeted housing subsidy program and other&#13;
programs for assisting the most disadvantaged segments of the population). A condition of&#13;
disbursement will be that the Government will conclude a Subsidiary Grant Agreement with the&#13;
Donetsk Oblast, which would include procedures to transfer the social facilities to the three&#13;
municipalities (para 6.4 (iv)).&#13;
3.43   Heating Subsidy. For many years the mining communities and pensioners have received free&#13;
coal (6 tons a year delivered to the homes four times during the year) to heat their houses. The coal&#13;
comes from the producing mines, which are now being closed. Interviews conducted by the Bank in&#13;
the homes of affected parties revealed that the areas of most concern were: (i) jobs, (ii) the houses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
they live in; and (iii) the ability to heat houses in very cold winters.9 Few of the houses have any&#13;
district heating and depend entirely on coal for heat and cooking fuel. Consequently, as one of the&#13;
critical social mitigation measures, the project includes provision for the UDKR to provide a heating&#13;
subsidy by procuring 6 tons of coal per family and delivering it to the affected parties. As shown in&#13;
Table 3.3, the workers and pensioners (who currently also receive the coal) number 9,300 persons&#13;
(4,850 persons currently working at the 3 mines, and 4,450 pensioners also receiving the coal&#13;
subsidy).&#13;
3.44   The coal distributions under the project would take place in accordance with operational&#13;
guidelines to be adopted by the UDKR. It is expected that the UDKR will distribute the coal to each&#13;
person who fits the following criteria: an employee, pensioner, disabled former employee, or member&#13;
of the immediate family of a former employee who was killed in a mining accident at one of the three&#13;
project mines; in the case of an employee, such employee is not re-employed by another coal mine;&#13;
and continuing to live in the same residence in the same municipality as before the mnine closure, said&#13;
residence being one where burning coal provides the only form of heat. At the end of the first year,&#13;
the subsidy will be reviewed as to the viability of converting it to cash, or phasing it out.&#13;
3.45   The funding of the coal distribution program would be on a declining basis, in the same&#13;
formula as used for the kindergartens, i.e. (75, 50 and 25 percent the first three years). Criteria to&#13;
evaluate the continued need for the subsidy would be: (i) the ability of the UDKR to handle the coal&#13;
deliveries; (ii) the cost of the coal provided; and (iii) whether the coal was effectively delivered to the&#13;
families and used appropriately (i.e. not resold). The alternative of "cashing out" the mitigation&#13;
measure i.e. letting farnilies buy their own coal if funding were provided, would be studied. Project&#13;
implementation would include spot checks to monitor progress in this area. The UDKR would&#13;
include the costs of coal purchases and delivery in its annual operating budget.&#13;
4. Institutional Strengthening and Job Counselling&#13;
3.46   The Bank loan would support the incremental operating costs of the UDKR, on a declining&#13;
basis. This is discussed in paras 4.1 - 4.4. To assist in the job search and to provide advice as to&#13;
where openings might exist, job counsellors to be recruited by the UDKR would help miners and&#13;
surface workers to find jobs at other mines or to secure alternative employment opportunities. Grant&#13;
funds (e.g. from Canada) are being sought for this component. The counsellors would be initially&#13;
trained abroad and would be stationed at each of the closing mines for a period of six to twelve&#13;
months.'" The counsellor would serve as a type of ombudsman and would be available for daily&#13;
consultation with miners, related workers, and their families on such issues as where are there&#13;
alternative job possibilities (in the mines or other industries), what is the housing situation there, and&#13;
is there availability of kindergartens and other social services. Grievances that workers may have&#13;
about the process could be brought to the attention of the counsellors, who would refer them to&#13;
UDKR management.&#13;
9/ Interviewees all said "we will freeze to death without coal supply and funds to buy the coal."&#13;
10/ A recent Bank study on several countries in Eastern Europe (Hungary, Poland) has shown that in OECD countries, job&#13;
placement services have been two to four times as cost-effective as retraining of workers shed through industrial&#13;
restructuring. Germany, on the other hand, has had good experience with re-training workers from former East Germany.&#13;
The various findings point to the need for careful monitoring and fine-tuning of both types of assistance. For this and other&#13;
reasons, close monitoring will be done under the Pilot Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
5. Technical Services&#13;
3.47   Technical services for the following subcomponents would be provided under the project":&#13;
(a)    Mitigation of physical closure. Assistance in contracting and implementing works for&#13;
physical closure would be provided. The U.K. Know-How Fund has expressed&#13;
strong interest in supporting UDKR's institutional program (Annex 12).&#13;
(b)    Management of UDKR. Consultant services would be provided to the UDKR to&#13;
assist establishment and initiation of operations, including project implementation,&#13;
accounting, budgeting and auditing systems (U.K. Know-How Fund, as above).&#13;
(c)    Retraining Programs. Assistance in preparing and delivering retraining programs&#13;
centered around new job skills for competitive markets would be provided. Emphasis&#13;
would be on voucher-based training that encourages individual choice (paras 2.21 -&#13;
2.22).&#13;
(d)    Environment. Assistance in preparing and implementing plans for environmental&#13;
mitigation would be provided.&#13;
(e)    Feasibility studies for investments to increase productivitv of viable mines. The&#13;
sector restructuring program includes possible investment into profitable mines to&#13;
make them more viable. Modernization and rationalization of existing mine&#13;
operations is needed so that they can remain competitive. Assistance in preparing and&#13;
implementing studies for investments, which would support such&#13;
modernization/rationalization of viable mines would be provided. The studies would&#13;
be prepared by the mines, with the assistance of Ukrainian and international experts.&#13;
Up to six mines would be involved. The mines would be analyzed to see if the&#13;
possible investments would promise sound economic and financial returns, in light of&#13;
the remaining economic life of the mine, the suitability of the mine to expand its&#13;
operations, and the management capacity.&#13;
(f)    Regional economic development activities would identify the Donbas region's&#13;
potential and help it to compete for new private investment. A diversified economy is&#13;
the best hedge against the ongoing contraction of the coal industry. Technical&#13;
assistance would be used to help establish local economic development offices and&#13;
prepare strategies for each of the cities affected by mine closures.&#13;
(g)    Public information strategy. A strategically phased public information program would&#13;
be collaboratively designed and implemented by the GOU through the UDKR and&#13;
II/ As indicated, bilateral grants are being sought for several of these technical services components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
local groups. The strategy would entail information dissemination and outreach,&#13;
including national, regional, oblast, raion, and local mine levels.'2&#13;
(h)    Social assessment. Building on the first phase of social assessment, there is a need&#13;
for a second phase, multi-disciplinary social assessment which addresses issues of&#13;
poverty, gender (i.e. impacts on woman and children), health and nutrition, and&#13;
values, attitudes, and outlooks of the mine community (i.e. by adapting a successful&#13;
coal miners' survey conducted in Russia). The 2-3 month assessment will attempt to&#13;
combine rapid qualitative and more quantitative survey methodologies, aimed at&#13;
gathering both secondary and primary data from the communities facing immnediate&#13;
closure. If possible, investigation of the status of those workers previously laid-off or&#13;
who left voluntarily from both the mining and other enterprises will be carried out.&#13;
Quantitative household surveys would establish necessary baseline data from which to&#13;
monitor and evaluate changes once the pilot mines close.&#13;
(i)    Consultation and participation of affected parties. In order to engage and learn from&#13;
the affected workers in the Pilot mines, a process of consultation and participation will&#13;
be initiated at an appropriate stage in each pilot mine through facilitated on-site&#13;
meetings of affected parties (workers, their families, other stakeholders). These&#13;
discussions will offer a forum for information-sharing, review and deternination of&#13;
social protection and mitigation options, design of monitorable indicators, and the&#13;
establishment of representative participation committees or advisory panels as long-&#13;
term mechanisms for ongoing project monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
(j)    Monitoring and evaluation. One of the most important elements of the Pilot Project&#13;
involves setting up of a monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system which would&#13;
directly inform about project implementation in the pilot phase, and would influence&#13;
design and implementation decisions for the planned subsequent projects. The M&amp;E&#13;
program needs to be tailored to two levels: (i) for project as a whole, and (ii) for&#13;
each mine. A process of participatory monitoring would be carried out by&#13;
representatives of affected parties, including workers, municipalities, the UDKR, the&#13;
Ministry of Coal Industry, and possibly an outside party such as an NGO.&#13;
E. The Project's Impact on Local Govermnents&#13;
3.48   Local governments in Ukraine are in the process of a major transition. Their responsibilities&#13;
are increasing as revenues decrease. This project takes place against the backdrop of two major&#13;
changes in national policy, both of which are still. in the process of being implemented. The first is&#13;
that the Soviet-era network of enterprise-supported social infrastructure is being transferred to&#13;
municipal authorities in all sectors. In the case of the coal industry specifically, a Presidential Decree&#13;
dated February 7, 1996 provides that enterprise-owned social assets will be transferred to municipal&#13;
ownership during 1996 and the first half of 1997. These transfers, in the aggregate, will require&#13;
L2/At the national level, GOU has already announced publicly its intention to close 92 mines, and the Cabinet of Ministers&#13;
has signed a decree committing its support for: a) the closing of the three Donetsk Oblast mines and b) the Bank-assisted&#13;
Pilot Project to mitigate the social and environmental consequences of the three closures. At the mine level, information&#13;
needs to be conmmunicated more fully to the workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
significant additional budget support for the municipalities. The Project will provide such support, on&#13;
a declining basis, but only for the social assets associated with the three pilot mines.&#13;
3.49   The second national policy change in process is that charges to residents (owners and renters&#13;
alike) for housing and communal services are being systematically raised to cost recovery levels.&#13;
They have already risen from approximately 5% of operating costs to 60% of operating costs in less&#13;
than two years, and are tentatively planned to cover 100% of costs by the end of 1996. This&#13;
dramatic increase is offset for the poor by a new program of needs-based subsidies which is intended&#13;
to limit housing expenses to 15% of family income.&#13;
3.50   The Project's impact on the three municipalities is summarized below and in Annex 9.13&#13;
Because the coal mines in question are not paying significant taxes today, the cities do not expect a&#13;
direct impact on their revenues from the mines' closure. In the long run, there could be some&#13;
negative impact on personal income tax revenues (approximately 1 % of the city's revenues in&#13;
Snezhnoye, which is the worst case), although all three cities report receiving little or no direct&#13;
revenues from these mines today. And there will be a small but measurable increase in expenditures&#13;
as the social assets are transferred to the municipalities. Without the mitigation funding provided by&#13;
the project, the impact on the municipal budgets, based on 1995 costs, expressed in US dollars, is as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Proletarsky Raion'4       Yenakievo             Snezhnoye&#13;
(US Dollars)&#13;
Mine's social asset costs         47,370                  407,800              414,173&#13;
Municipal Budget              6,151,667                10,274,187            5,919,247&#13;
Mine/Municipal proportion          0.8%                      4.0%                 7.0%&#13;
With mitigation funding provided by the project, the impact of the transfer of these social&#13;
assets as a percentage of the municipal budget is less, as follows:&#13;
Year 1                             0.2%                      1.0%                 1.8%&#13;
Year 2                             0.4%                      2.0%                 3.5%&#13;
Year 3                             0.6%                      3.0%                 5.3%&#13;
3.51   The financial impacts on the cities of these three mine's divestiture of social infrastructure is&#13;
trivial in comparison to the likely impact of the two national policies discussed above. If the national&#13;
policy for full-cost recovery of housing and communal services is implemented as expected, over half&#13;
of the asset transfer's impact on city budgets is eliminated. If the national policy for transfer of all&#13;
enterprise assets, or even all coal enterprise assets is implemented, the impact on municipal budgets&#13;
from these pilot asset transfers is dwarfed, and significant resources beyond the scope of this Project&#13;
will be required from the national budget. In the larger picture, this merely amounts to a change in&#13;
13/ As shown in Annex 9, two scenarios are presented for Snezhnoye and Yenakievo, one assuming no change in user&#13;
charges for housing and communal services, and one assuming the Government's policy of increasing such charges to cost-&#13;
recovery level is implemented. For the Proletarsky Raion of Donetsk, only one scenario is presented, as the Raion will not&#13;
be affected by the housing transfer.&#13;
14/ Note that the housing associated with the Pravda mines will be transferred to the City of Donetsk, rather than the&#13;
Lion, and is not included in these figures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
channels, since these assets were historically supported from the national budget, through the&#13;
enterprise channel.&#13;
F. On-lending Arrangements&#13;
3.52   The on-lending arrangements are as follows:&#13;
(a)    The Bank would sign a Loan Agreement with Ukraine;&#13;
(b)    The Bank would sign Project Aereements with the UDKR and with the Donetsk&#13;
Oblast. The arrangements between the Donetsk Oblast and the three municipalities&#13;
would be governed by Participating City Agreements. Each agreement would outline&#13;
implementation procedures and requirements; and&#13;
(c)    The Government of Ukraine would pass the proceeds of the loan on a grant basis to&#13;
the UDKR and to the Donetsk Oblast through Subsidiary Grant Agreements; the&#13;
Oblast will in turn pass the proceeds on to the three cities, on the same grant basis,&#13;
through Participatory City Agreements.&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Project Implementation Plan&#13;
4.1    Responsibilities for project execution are summarized in Table 4.1. The detailed&#13;
implementation steps are shown in Box 4.1 below. The main implementation responsibility is with&#13;
the UDKR. Overall project oversight and policy coordination will be handled by a Project Steering&#13;
Committee (PSC) comprised of representatives of MCI, the Donetsk Oblast, the three municipalities&#13;
and the Ministry of Economy and Cabinet of Ministers who will meet periodically to review progress&#13;
on the project and to resolve outstanding issues. Management of social infrastructure will be carried&#13;
out by the local administrations (the city administration for the cities of Yenakievo and Snezhnoye,&#13;
and the district administration for the Proletarsky rayon of the city of Donetsk). Respective roles and&#13;
functions of these entities are described below (diagrams depicting the organizational set-up and&#13;
process are shown in Annex 16).&#13;

1. The UDKR&#13;
4.2    The Minister of Coal Industry established the basis for UDKR's creation by order dated&#13;
January 1, 1996 (Annex 1 1). The UDKR was registered with the Donetsk City Executive Committee&#13;
(certificate dated March 13, 1996). UDKR's Charter (Ustav) and staffing plan were approved by the&#13;
Minister of Coal Industry on March 1, 1996. The primary objective of the UDKR is to provide&#13;
practical and effective assistance to workers and businesses in the coal producing regions in order to&#13;
stimulate job creation and promote economic regeneration. In order to meet this objective, the&#13;
UDKR's role will be to encourage and support local initiatives which aim to provide economic&#13;
restructuring and social development in areas affected by mine closures. Annex 12 shows a program&#13;
of institutional support that the U.K. Know-How Fund plans to provide to UDKR.&#13;
4.3    The UDKR will assume responsibility for the actual closure of mines and for the social&#13;
mitigation and heat subsidy program. Once fully staffed (the plan calls for 135 employees), the&#13;
UDKR will begin the immediate task of establishing the local network of contacts to ensure the&#13;
maximum contribution is made to the job creation, and economic regeneration objectives. In&#13;
addition, the UDKR will be responsible for disbursement of all funds made available for workers'&#13;
compensation, transfer benefits, redundancy, and the promotion of job creation and economic&#13;
regeneration.&#13;
4.4    The UDKR will also undertake a program of public information designed to assure that all&#13;
affected parties are aware of the overall restructuring context as well as specific mine closure&#13;
activities.&#13;
2. The Role of the Municipalities&#13;
4.5    Housing and kindergartens would be transferred to the appropriate municipal authorities. For&#13;
the cities of Yenakievo and Snezhnoye, this is the city administration. As mentioned, for the city of&#13;
Donetsk, which is divided into raions, this is the Proletarsky Raion for kindergartens and other social&#13;
assets, and the city of Donetsk for housing. The Government of Ukraine would reimburse these&#13;
municipal authorities for a portion of their increased operating costs resulting from this transfer (less&#13;
revenues from user fees). The reimbursement (financed by the Bank loan on a declining scale)&#13;
provides time and incentive for (i) rationalization of operations; and (ii) increases in user fees to cost-&#13;
recovery levels (paired with the Government's targeted housing subsidy program), thus facilitating&#13;
sustainability of operations for the rationalized social assets. The cities would track their incremental&#13;
operating costs for the transferred social infrastructure, and would certify the amounts to the UDKR.&#13;
The UDKR would review these reports, and upon UDKR approval, the MoF would transfer the&#13;
reimbursement directly to the municipal authorities.&#13;
4.6    Housing waiting lists of the mines to be closed would be merged with the housing waiting&#13;
lists of the appropriate municipal authorities.&#13;
4.7    Electric substations owned by mines to be closed but serving existing housing would be&#13;
transferred to the municipalities together with the housing they serve or to the appropriate local&#13;
electric utility enterprise.&#13;
4.8    Other assets of the mines to be closed (profilactoria, sanitoria, rest houses, palaces of culture,&#13;
clubs, etc.) would be transferred to the appropriate health or municipal authorities (the cities of&#13;
Yenakievo and Snezhnoye and the Proletarsky Raion of Donetsk), except in the case of remote&#13;
facilities, which should be privatized through auction as soon as possible.&#13;

- monitoring and evaluation plan                UDKR                        GoU/Bank&#13;
Note:   The UDKR would have the main responsibility for the project; the Donetsk Oblast and the municipalities would&#13;
handle the disbursement of proceeds for dives.iture of social infrastructure and public works. The Donetsk Oblast&#13;
would handle regional economic development, retraining and public information; an agency to be determined (tbd)&#13;
would handle the micro-credit. The Ministry of Coal Industry would handle the feasibility studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
3. Participatory Mechanisms and Evaluation&#13;
4.9    The two-fold challenge is (i) to get meaningful participation by affected parties in the Pilot&#13;
Project, and (ii) to learn by doing, i.e. to use the Pilot Project as a tool for stakeholder analysis,&#13;
monitoring, and evaluation so that the subsequent restructuring projects are well designed.&#13;
4.10   Beneficiary participation would be achieved through four mechanisms:&#13;
(i)    the establishment of participation panels at each of the three sites to monitor project&#13;
implementation;&#13;
(ii)   the establishment of an overall Project Steering Committee (PSC) to provide policy&#13;
guidance and to resolve outstanding issues;&#13;
(iii)   an ongoing public information strategy; and&#13;
(iv)   periodic social assessment work to identify the Project's impact at each site.&#13;
4.11   Each site-specific Participation Panel would be an advisory group to the UDKR; one Panel&#13;
which would include representatives of:&#13;
-      each of the unions at the closing mine;&#13;
-      the local administration (city and if applicable, raion);&#13;
-      the local elected council (city and if applicable, raion);&#13;
-      the mine's managers;&#13;
-      several workers and family representatives; and&#13;
-      the local newspaper, television, or radio station.&#13;
Each Participation Panel would be regularly informed by the UDKR about implementation&#13;
progress, in order to provide (a) systematic infornation to, and consultation with key stakeholders;&#13;
and (b) meaningful feedback to the UDKR and other decision makers. The three Participation Panels,&#13;
would continue in existence during the life of the project, and would be convened as often as&#13;
required. The Panels will prepare in tenns reports every six months. At the end of the project, a&#13;
detailed report and debriefing of each panel will allow the Government and the Bank to evaluate the&#13;
project as implemented against its design objectives. Each panel would be professionally facilitated&#13;
and will be provided with training and substantive education in the issues. Because the Pilot Project&#13;
would begin essentially immediately, it is anticipated that the greatest uses of the Participation Panels&#13;
would be:&#13;
(a)    to allow the Government entities (national and local) and the World Bank to monitor&#13;
and evaluate implementation, as it occurs at each site; and&#13;
(b)    to inform the design of the subsequent assistance operations.&#13;
4.12   The Project Steering Committee would include representatives of:&#13;
the Cabinet of Ministers (CoM) or their designated representatives (e.g. Ministry of&#13;
Economy, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Social Protection);&#13;
the Ministry of Coal Industry;&#13;
the UDKR;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
each of the unions (the official miners' union, the two independent miners' unions,&#13;
and the "white collar" technical and administrative union);&#13;
local administrations;&#13;
Oblast Administration; and&#13;
mine managers.&#13;
The PSC would help to guide the UDKR on policy aspects and on resolving any major difficulties in&#13;
the course of implementation. The PSC would also evaluate the project and formulate&#13;
recommendations regarding next steps in the work of the UDKR.&#13;
4.13   The public information strategy would be developed by the PSC, the Government, and the&#13;
Bank, and would be designed to keep the public at large and the citizens at each site fully informed&#13;
about the status of the project, planned events, and the work of the Participation Panels and the PSC.&#13;
Technical assistance would be provided as described earlier. Where appropriate, media&#13;
representatives would be invited to meetings of the Participation Panels and the PSC.&#13;
4.14   Social assessment and survey work would be carried out by qualified Ukrainian institutions&#13;
to determine and establish baseline information and expectations at the beginning of the project, as&#13;
well as during and after the project's implementation. Technical assistance would be provided as&#13;
described earlier.&#13;
B. Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
4.15   Procurement under the Bank loan would cover: (i) civil works needed to support the civil&#13;
works for physical closure and environmental mitigation out the physical closure and environmental&#13;
mitigation; (ii) the purchase of auxiliary equipment needed to support the civil works for physical&#13;
closure and environmental mitigation; and (iii) the hiring of consulting services. For all other&#13;
activities financed under the proposed loap, such as the divestiture of social infrastructure, and re-&#13;
employment support, no procurement arrangements are applicable. Given the small size of the&#13;
contracts expected for physical closure and environmental mitigation and the fact that the works are&#13;
geographically scattered and labor intensive, civil works will be procured following National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Foreign firms are unlikely to be&#13;
interested in these contracts but will not be excluded from participation. The relevant implementing&#13;
agencies will use the Bank's regional sample bidding documents for NCB. Consultants would be&#13;
appointed in accordance with the Bank Group's guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1991).&#13;
For the feasibility studies, consultant services would be procured using short listing; for other&#13;
technical assistance tasks, each of small value, a sole source basis would be used. Table 4.2&#13;
summarizes the procurement arrangements. All of these arrangements will be discussed in depth at&#13;
the Project Launch Workshop in May 1996 (see para 4.25).&#13;
4.16  In Ukraine, like many other states of the former Soviet Union, there is no public procurement&#13;
law at present. A country procurement strategy note is scheduled for 1997. Experience in competitive&#13;
bidding is limited to a few projects financed by international organizations.&#13;
4.17   Procurement of mine operating costs during closure, social mitigation expenses, social assets&#13;
transfer expenses and UDKR administrative expenses will be undertaken through a yearly operating&#13;
budget program prepared by the implementing agency and approved by the Bank.&#13;

Prior review. Contracts under NCB and for goods and works amounting to US$300,000&#13;
equivalent and more would be subject to prior review. All contracts for consulting firms amounting&#13;
to US$100,000 and more, as well as all contracts for individual consultants amounting to US$50,000&#13;
and more would also be subject to the Bank's prior review. Terms of reference for all consulting&#13;
services shall have a prior review by the Bank.&#13;
4.18    Loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed over a three-year period. The Bank's standard&#13;

Disbursement for works, incremental operating costs, social mitigation expenses, and social assets transfer will be&#13;
undertaken based on a yearly operating budget program prepared by the implementing agency and approved by the Bank.&#13;
4.19    To facilitate disbursement, the Government would establish two separate Special Accounts&#13;
(SAs) in commercial banks for the two main implementing bodies -- the UDKR and the Donetsk&#13;
Oblast. The SAs would cover the Bank's share of expenses under the project. The Donetsk Oblast&#13;
Special Account would cover the transfer of social assets.&#13;
4.20    An initial deposit of US$500,000 would be made available for the Special Account for UDKR&#13;
upon Loan effectiveness. For the Donetsk Oblast Special Account, an initial deposit of US$200,000&#13;
would be made available. The Bank would replenish the Special Accounts upon receipt of satisfactory&#13;
proof of incurred eligible expenses, accompanied by a bank statement and reconciliation of the Special&#13;
Accounts. Payments for expenditures prior to the date of the Loan Agreement, except for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
withdrawals, in aggregate amount not to exceed the equivalent of $1,500,000, may be made on&#13;
account of payments made for expenditures before that date but after January 12, 1996 (creation of&#13;
UDKR).&#13;
4.21   The UDKR would maintain the Special Accounts for loan-financed components and would&#13;
keep them separately from any existing accounts. All disbursements would need to be fully&#13;
documented except for all operating costs, social mitigation expenses, coal distributions, expenditures&#13;
for goods and works under contracts costing less than $300,000 equivalent for incremental operating&#13;
costs, and for expenditures of consultants' services under contracts costing less than (i) $100,000 for&#13;
firms, and (ii) $50,000 equivalent for individuals, under such terms and conditions as the Bank shall&#13;
specify by notice to the Borrower.&#13;
4.22   The Donetsk Oblast would maintain the Special Account for the social assets component and&#13;
would keep it separately from any other existing accounts. Disbursements will be made against&#13;
statement of expenditure (SOEs). The Donetsk Oblast would be responsible for preparing withdrawal&#13;
applications. The documentation for withdrawals under SOEs will be retained at the Donetsk Oblast&#13;
for review by Bank supervision missions and for regular and semi-annual audits. At the city and&#13;
raion level detailed quarterly and yearly reports that itemize uses of funds would be kept. Quarterly&#13;
Uses-of-Funds statements that are very specific in relation to social assets would help to clear various&#13;
uses of the funds , and also help to separate them from municipalities' other activities. For example,&#13;
for kindergartens, the quarterly Uses-of-Funds include payroll, food and day attendance. The yearly&#13;
Uses-of-Funds reports would show utilities expenditures. The supervisory role would be managed by&#13;
the Donetsk Oblast, which would spot-check the disbursements, and arrange audits of the expenditure&#13;
as necessary.&#13;

4.23   The UDKR and the Donetsk Oblast will maintain accounts for loan-financed components&#13;
separate from any other existing accounts. They will maintain records of all receipts and&#13;
disbursements of funds. Copies of these documents will be routinely submitted to the UDKR and to&#13;
the Donetsk Oblast. Each project account will be audited separately on an annual basis by a firm of&#13;
independent accountants acceptable to the World Bank. Audits will be made available to the World&#13;
Bank by June 30 each year. The audits will include a separate opinion on the SOEs and each Special&#13;
Account. These arrangements will be confirmed during negotiations.&#13;
D. Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.24   Supervision, monitoring and evaluation of project implementation at the national level would&#13;
be assigned to the PSC. The PSC would draw on the work of the Participation Panels. Monitoring&#13;
and coordination of project implementation would be assigned to implementation advisors (UDKR&#13;
employees) and the job counsellors at each mine. Consultants financed through the technical&#13;
assistance component of the project will provide expert advice in procurement, financial management&#13;
and beneficiary assessment. The UDKR will prepare a quarterly progress report on overall project&#13;
implementation based on reports from the local governments.&#13;
4.25   Since the UDKR is a new body and the MCI has no experience in implementing Bank&#13;
projects, the project will require substantial supervision by the Bank during its implementation. A&#13;
project launch workshop is scheduled for May 1996. At negotiations, the Bank reached an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
understanding with UDKR and the project municipalities on the critical actions to be taken by quarter&#13;
and this will be discussed more fully at the project launch workshop. A formal mid-term&#13;
implementation review is scheduled for the first half of 1997 whereby senior government officials and&#13;
the Bank would undertake a comprehensive review of project implementation to date, especially on&#13;
the labor and social mitigation package. Under the supervision of the PSC, the implementation&#13;
advisor (U.K. Know-How Fund) and the job counsellors will coordinate with the UDKR and will&#13;
prepare an evaluation report by March 1907. The report will be reviewed by the Bank and&#13;
Government. In the subsequent year, supervision efforts may be reduced, depending on the success&#13;
in the implementation process and accumulation of the relevant experience by local authorities. The&#13;
supervision plan is shown in Annex 14. A bar chart of implementation steps at the mine level is&#13;
shown in Annex 10.&#13;
4.26   Given the complexity of the project, and the importance of monitoring employment generation&#13;
and labor movements, monitoring plan and performance indicators for the social components were&#13;
agreed upon during negotiations. Annex 17 shows the terms of reference for social impact&#13;
monitoring plus indicative monitoring indicators for the social aspects (indicators for the technical&#13;
aspects are more routine). The information will be collected by UDKR in a timely manner for its&#13;
own understanding of the impact of the social mitigation measures, and such information will be&#13;
submitted quarterly to the Bank.&#13;
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION, BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
5.1    A full cost-benefit analysis for the three mine Pilot Project has been carried out. Annex 15&#13;
shows these calculations for each mine individually as well as consolidated for the Pilot Project. The&#13;
cost and benefit cash flows have been discounted by 12% annually and they have been extended for a&#13;
five years period after the project completion, i.e., up to the year 2003.&#13;
Economic and Fiscal Analysis of Mine Closures&#13;
5.2   The net benefits in the long run of closing a mine depend upon:&#13;
*     the reduction in non-labor mining costs -- energy, pit props, other material inputs, and&#13;
replacement equipment -- resulting from the fall or transfer of coal production plus the&#13;
net increase in the value of output due to the redeployment of mine workers;&#13;
*     the cost of replacing the lost output from other mines or by importing coal or by the&#13;
use of alternative fuels.&#13;
These net benefits are set against the costs of closing the mine, allowing for the fact that&#13;
many of these costs might, in any case, have been incurred at a later date when the mine's reserves&#13;
are exhausted.&#13;
5.3    Usually, such calculations do not take into account the redistribution of income caused by the&#13;
project or its impact on the labor market. However in this case, a fuller analysis was performed,&#13;
estimating the impact of the mine closure on different groups within the economy. Table 5.1 below&#13;
presents a more complete picture of the flows associated with two scenarios in which the mine&#13;
continues to operate, and where it is closed immediately. Many of these items cancel out when&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
looking at the problem from the perspective of the economy as a whole, especially if some&#13;
simplifying assumptions are made. In particular, by assuming that (a) coal prices are set equal to&#13;
import parity plus transport and distribution costs; and (b) the marginal and average costs of transport&#13;
and distribution for coal are approximately equal, the costs and benefits under each scenario may be&#13;
summarized as:&#13;
(a) Without project:&#13;
Benefits:  Locally produced coal delivered to consumers:&#13;
Costs:    Material inputs &amp; replacement equipment (import cost);&#13;
Wages of workers in alternative jobs (economic cost of labor);&#13;
Maintenance and operation of social assets;&#13;
Coal cleaning costs;&#13;
Coal distribution and transport; and&#13;
Future closure and mitigation costs.&#13;
(b) With project:&#13;
Benefits:  Equivalent of imported coal delivered to consumers; and&#13;
Value of extra output from redeployed miners:&#13;
Costs:    Coal imports + transport &amp; distribution costs (=coal sales);&#13;
Closure costs;&#13;
Wages of workers in alternative jobs;&#13;
Social mitigation cost (incl transfer of workers, free coal &amp; special&#13;
employment programs);&#13;
Maintenance and operation of social assets; and&#13;
Administration of closure program.&#13;
In aggregate terms, the net benefit of implementing the project is, thus, equal to the difference&#13;
between the benefits minus the costs under the with project and no project scenarios. The economic&#13;
rate of return works out to 55% (ranging from 20% for Removskaya, 93% for Pravda and 65% for&#13;
Krasniy Oktyabr). The ERRs are high because of the avoidance of continued future losses and&#13;
subsidies.&#13;
5.4       The table also shows that the closure of a mine causes a substantial redistribution of&#13;
income between different groups. Specifically, mine workers will be net losers if the sum of wages&#13;
in alternative jobs plus severance, unemployment and social security payments is less than the wages&#13;
that they currently receive from the mine. The payment of wages has often been delayed by many&#13;
months, so the magnitude of this loss may be small or zero. High rates of voluntary tumover in the&#13;
industry -- prompted by late payment of wages -- suggests that this may, indeed, be the case. On the&#13;
other side, the Government budget is likely to gain because the fall in subsidies (after allowing for&#13;
closure, social mitigation and other costs) will exceed any loss in revenue. However, in this context&#13;
the Govermnent is simply the channel through which money is transferred from taxpayers -- other&#13;
households -- to those who benefit from the continued operation of the mine. This means that the&#13;
overall distributional impact of the project may be positive if the typical taxpayer or recipient of&#13;
government transfers is less well-off than the typical recipient of mining subsidies. The key variable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
is how many workers will find alternative jobs in the short- and long-term. In Table 3.4, estimates&#13;
were presented about the likely magnitudes of those who might find employment versus those who&#13;
might not, and in which risk categories. In the middle case, 66 percent would not find alternative&#13;
jobs in the near term (two years), but over a longer term, the outlook would improve. The mitigation&#13;
benefits provided for under this Pilot Project offer social protection to meet these concerns.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
5.5    Risks. There are several significant risks (hence the Bank felt it necessary to start with a&#13;
Pilot Project):&#13;
(i) the affected workers might not be able to find other jobs and thus the social mitigation&#13;
measures as provided for in the Project might prove inadequate.&#13;
*         Approach: The Government has adopted a regional approach starting this&#13;
Pilot Project through one Oblast. UDKR will mount specific&#13;
monitoring/evaluation of job search progress; work closely with the job&#13;
counsellors, and review whether the package of social mitigation measures will&#13;
need to be modified as implementation proceeds.&#13;
(ii) A second risk is that the disparate interest of workers, mine management and the&#13;
Government could result in inaction and social dislocation.&#13;
*         Approach: The Government is mounting increased public discussions of the&#13;
sector restructuring program. 7he PSC would review implementation very&#13;
closely and Bank supervision should liaise intensively with the PSC.&#13;
(iii)        A third risk is that the UDKR could become ineffective as it attempts to&#13;
handle the mine closure process, the social mitigation and the economic&#13;
regeneration activities.&#13;
&amp;         Approach: Substantial technical assistance will be provided by the U.K.&#13;
Know-How Fund to assist in start-up and early operations. The Donetsk&#13;
Oblast will assist in economic regeneration.&#13;
5.6    The risks of the Project are considerable. Yet, the Government has decided for very sound&#13;
reasons to proceed with restructuring of the coal sector, including closure of unprofitable mines.&#13;
There is little doubt that with mines being closed the miners and related workers (and their families)&#13;
will be better off with the mitigation package as included in the project, than without it. In fact, in&#13;
the half-dozen mine closures that have occurred over the past five years, there was no mitigation&#13;
package to speak of, and the restructuring of the sector became delayed. The design of the project,&#13;
with its mine-by-mine approach, allows the GoU and the Bank to review progress closely and "to&#13;
leam by doing" in this challenging initiative of implementing a well-targeted social protection safety&#13;
net.&#13;
5.7    The risks have also been reduced through careful project design, including such steps as:&#13;
*  provision of initial technical assistance to the UDKR and to design institutes (financed by&#13;
the Japan PHRD);&#13;
*  increased consultations with stakeholders during Pilot Project preparation;&#13;
*  contracting of the physical closure of the mines; and&#13;
*  inclusion of detailed monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for inplementation of the&#13;
Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.1    Prior to negotiations, the following actions were carried out:&#13;
(i)  the Government designated the three mines under the project as mines that will be&#13;
closed (para 3.2).&#13;
(ii)  the Government registered the UDKR, appointed a chief executive, and approved&#13;
UDKR's charter, including its operating and staffing plan (para 4.2);'5&#13;
6.2    The following agreements were reached during negotiations and are reflected in the Loan and&#13;
Project Agreements and recorded in the Minutes:&#13;
(i)  the Government will establish the Project Steering Committee (para 4.1);&#13;
(ii)  a Charter for the UDKR, satisfactory to the Bank will be prepared for its operations&#13;
(this has been done);&#13;
(iii) the three participating cities/towns (Donetsk, Yenakievo, Snezhnoye) has taken over the&#13;
social assets of the three mines pursuant to the Participating City Agreements (para 3.42&#13;
and Annex 9);&#13;
(iv)  obligations to affected workers (such as three months severance and disability payments)&#13;
will be met (paras 3.23);&#13;
(v)  the eligibility criteria for micro-credit lending to be developed prior to disbursements&#13;
(para 3.36); and&#13;
(vi)  the UDKR will collect and document information necessary for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation; such information will be submitted every three months (para 4.26 and&#13;
Annex 17).&#13;
6.3    The following are conditions of effectiveness:&#13;
(i)  that the Borrower will enter into the Subsidiary Agreement with the UDKR; and&#13;
(ii)  that the UDKR will be adequately staffed to carry out its role and its functions under&#13;
the project.&#13;
6.4    Conditions of disbursement for their respective categories are:&#13;
(i)  adoption of a mine closure plan by the UDKR for each of the 3 mines, satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank, including the environmental mitigation plan;&#13;
15/ MCI Decree No. 11, dated January 12, 1996; UDKR was registered on March 13, 1996. The charter (ustav) was&#13;
approved by rt.e Minister of Coal Industry on March 1, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
(ii)  for the social mitigation package, the UDKR will prepare a manual or other&#13;
documentation of the procedures for making and accounting for payments to affected&#13;
parties, and for the heating subsidy (para 3.44). This would include details of required&#13;
documentation for confirming the eligibility of recipients to receive social mitigation&#13;
payments and the coal distributions (para 3.5 and Box 4.1);&#13;
(iii) for the micro-credit component, execution of a satisfactory Fiscal Agency Agreement&#13;
between the Borrower and the agency selected for carrying out the micro-credit lending.&#13;
This should include appointment of the agency to appraise the micro-credits and&#13;
supervise lending, including obtaining repayments from beneficiaries, application&#13;
procedures, selection criteria, and terms and conditions of on-lending. The&#13;
administration costs of the fiscal agent would be covered by a management fee out of&#13;
proceeds from the subcomponent (para 3.35 - 3.38); and&#13;
(iv) the Borrower will conclude a Subsidiary Agreement with the Donetsk Oblast which&#13;
would include procedures to transfer the social facilities to the three municipalities&#13;
(paras 3.39 - 3.42).&#13;
6.5    Subject to the above conditions, the proposed Coal Pilot Project is suitable for a loan to&#13;
Ukraine of US$15.8 million for a period of 17 years, including five years grace at the Bank's&#13;
standard variable interest rate.&#13;

In view of the (i) need to increase the efficiency of the coal industry of Ukraine, promote&#13;
competition, improve the profitability of enterprises, and speed up restructuring; and (ii) the&#13;
commitment of the World Bank to actively support the achievement of these goals;&#13;
Taking into account the experience of Great Britain, Hungary, Belgium; and France in the&#13;
restructuring of their coal industries; and&#13;
Considering a number of proposals prepared by the Ukrainian side and the World Bank;&#13;
The delegations reached agreement on the need to implement the following measures:&#13;
Establishment of coal markets by providing enterprises the right to sell all their coal at&#13;
prices freely negotiated with customers.&#13;
Corporatization of viable coal mines while transfering the mines identified for closure to a&#13;
newly created ehltity, Ukrainian Coal Company, entrusted with the management of the mine&#13;
closure process.&#13;
Closure of uneconomic mines with the aim of minimizing the technical cost and the time&#13;
required for closure while taking into account the need to protect the environment and the&#13;
livelihood of people affected by mine closures.&#13;
Transfer of social assets and liabilities from the mining industry to local governments.&#13;
Development and implementation of programs to support the generation of employment in&#13;
regions/cities where major job losses occur as a result of mine closures and the&#13;
rationalization of employment in remaining mines.&#13;
Elimination of cross-subsidies between mining enterprises and allowing enterprises to decide&#13;
about the best use of their operating profits.&#13;

Concentration of state support on covering the technical and social costs of mine closures&#13;
while relying on the banking sector to provide funds for commercially viable investments.&#13;
In order to assist Ukraine with the implementation of the above measures, the World Bank&#13;
plans to provide loans for the coal sector in a total amount of US$ 300-400 million in the 1996-98&#13;
period. Within this amount, US$ 80-100 million is planned to be approved in 1996. The proceeds&#13;
of these loans will be utilized to finance investments in the viable part of the coal industry, cover&#13;
part of the costs of closing down uneconomic mines, assist local governrments in taking over social&#13;
assets from mining companies, and mitigate the possible negative social consequences of&#13;
restructuring.&#13;
The World Bank is prepared to assist the Government of Ukraine in obtaining technical&#13;
assistance from the UK Know How Fund and other donors for the restructuring of the coal&#13;
industry. The World Bank is also prepared to assist Ukraine to obtain resources from the Global&#13;
Environment Facility for the extraction and utilization of coalbed methane.&#13;
The Ukrainian delegation would like to express its gratitude to the World Bank and the&#13;
British Know How Fund for the outstanding organization of the meeting, and the very informative&#13;
and useful visit to a number of British coal mines.&#13;

COAL PILOT PROJECT&#13;
PRAVDA MINES - DONETSK&#13;
1.    The Pravda mines are located in the Proletarsky Raion of the City of Donetsk. It is one of&#13;
the oldest raions of the city, and is physically remote. The Proletarsky Raion includes several mines&#13;
in addition to those in the Pravda group. All are older mines. The city as a whole has a relatively&#13;
diversified economy, and thus the best chance of the three pilot cities to absorb coal workers in other&#13;
sectors. Some two thousand workers are employed by the Pravda group, including miners, surface&#13;
workers, managers, and others. The Proletarsky Raion is the largest raion in Donetsk, with a&#13;
population of 138,000. Of these, 39,000 (28.26%) are pensioners.&#13;
1. Technical issues&#13;
2.    Pravda Mine. This mine is located next to the city of Donetsk, in an area where coal mining&#13;
began a century ago. Underground mine workings proceeded from the area where the coal seam reach&#13;
the surface to increasing depth by a complex network of galleries and shafts. Production costs and&#13;
the burden on the urban enviromnent have become so high that continuation of exploitation is no&#13;
longer justified. The mine property includes land where mining ceased long ago but many small&#13;
shafts, with partially unidentified location, were left behind unfilled. Those shafts now pose a safety&#13;
risk and environmental nuisance. Their detection and proper filling is a key feature of the physical&#13;
closing plan for this mine. Apart from this, the closing process of the Pravda mine is uncomplicated&#13;
and low-cost.&#13;
2. Social Infrastructure&#13;
The following assets are associated with the Pravda mines:&#13;
-      148,500 square meters of housing, in 627 buildings, housing 9,842 people&#13;
-      one kindergarten, with 96 places, and an enrollment of 72 children'&#13;
-      one dormitory, with 40 places, housing 40 people&#13;
-     three cultural facilities, with a total capacity of 1,328&#13;
-     two recreational bases (one on the Azov Sea of three cottages with 2 places each, and&#13;
one 20 km. from the mine with 15 cottages with 8 places each)&#13;
-     one summer camp, that was apparently never actually opened&#13;
1/ A site visit found 12 children and 14 employees at the kindergarten.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
3.      City officials plan to initially take on all of the social asset-related employees together with&#13;
the social assets, but that they will be looking for opportunities to restructure to operate more&#13;
efficiently. Proletarsky Raion officials are exploring means by which the cultural facilities and clubs&#13;
can remain in operation after the mine closes. They are working on a plan to consolidate&#13;
kindergartens for greater efficiency. City officials are concerned with practical aspects of the&#13;
transfer, for instance at what level of local government the housing will be owned and operated. The&#13;
City has appointed a special commission to document the condition of each house to be transferred to&#13;
the City.2&#13;
4.      Raion officials will be the ones responsible for operating the social assets, and are working&#13;
with the City of Donetsk officials to arrive at joint solutions.3 City officials plan for local authorities&#13;
to take over all of the social sphere from the Donetskugol Association, regardless of any particular&#13;
mine closings. Under this scheme, housing would be transferred to the city level, while waiting lists&#13;
for housing, kindergartens, and cultural facilities would be transferred to the raion level.&#13;
3. Labor Issues&#13;
-       breakdown by age&#13;
-       number of "disability" recipients&#13;
-       number of "retirement" recipients&#13;
-       other demographic informnation, as available)&#13;
5.      Raion officials predict that half of the Pravda mine workers will retire. They would like a&#13;
significant portion of the remaining workers to be employed over an extended closing period at the&#13;
mines, and envision that the rest would go to other mines. Both City and Raion officials are&#13;
concerned that a fast closing will throw a lot of people out of work. Miners consider their jobs to be&#13;
prestigious, and psychologically resist entering service industries. The City would like to see surface&#13;
facilities at the mines converted into small factories, although British experience suggests this is an&#13;
inefficient approach.&#13;
4. Financial Impact&#13;
6.      According to figures provided by the City Administration, total expenditures for upkeep of the&#13;
2/ This commission is to determine the amount of repairs needed to each house, and these calculations may serve as the&#13;
basis for a claim by the City against the mining association or any available successor.&#13;
3/ From the City's point of view, they finance the operations of the City's raions through the city budget, and thus are the&#13;
appropriate level to consider the financial impacts associated with increased operating costs. Under Ukraine's multi-level&#13;
system, Oblast officials similarly feel that since they finance the cities' operations, they are the appropriate level to consider&#13;
financial issues. However, because the methods by which each level judges how much to provide to lower levels are&#13;
obscure, it is recommended that funding be provided to the operational level, whether that is the city or the raion, and not to&#13;
supervisory levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
mining association's housing in the fourth quarter of 1995 were some 150 billion krb., and for 1996&#13;
are projected at some 678 billion krb. This is approximately $1.16 per square meter per year, and is&#13;
generally consistent with figures from other cities for maintenance of older, detached housing.4 City&#13;
officials report that the City generally maintains housing to a higher standard than the mine&#13;
enterprises, although formerly this situation was reversed.&#13;
7.     All of the Association's housing is planned to be transferred to municipal ownership in 1996.&#13;
In general, mine-owned housing is separate, small houses, while the city owns and operates mostly&#13;
apartments. At the overall unit operating cost of $1.16 per square meter, this implies some $173,000&#13;
in annual operating expenditures. However, the mining association separately calculated 24.029&#13;
billion krb in losses (net of user charges) for the Pravda housing in the first eight months of 1995.&#13;
This comes to $1.35 per square meter, or approximately $200,000 per year in annual operating&#13;
expenses. These two figures are close enough for the purposes of this scoping exercise, and it is pro-&#13;
posed that we accept the latter figure.&#13;
8.     In addition, based on calculations provided by the mining association, the city administration&#13;
will incur some $42,450 in operating losses associated with Kindergarten #232. If all social&#13;
infrastructure (including cultural and recreational facilities) were transferred, the mining association&#13;
calculates the annual operating loss would be some $263,000.&#13;
9.     The potential loss of tax revenues is not a large concern to the City of Donetsk, because the&#13;
coal enterprises are not currently paying significant taxes, although they have a theoretical obligation&#13;
to do so. Coal enterprises are engaged in the barter economy. Sometimes the City takes coal in lieu&#13;
of taxes, but it is difficult because coal production has declined sharply and what there is needed most&#13;
by power plants and other production enterprises.&#13;
10.    Raion officials believe that if the Government or World Bank provides transitional funding to&#13;
help offset these operating losses, it should be provided directly to the Raion. They suggest that&#13;
funds be deposited into the Raion's account in the PromInvestBank. However, City officials believe&#13;
the money should be deposited in the City's account, and not given to them through the national&#13;
budget system.&#13;
5. Other Social Commnitments&#13;
11.    About 990 people are on the Pravda mines' waiting list, and more than a thousand on the&#13;
Raion waiting list, but Raion officials do not consider these numbers (or the waiting lists) meaningful.&#13;
The average wait for an apartment in the raion is said to be 24 years. By the time a worker marries&#13;
and becomes eligible to be on the list, he or she may very well not live long enough to get an&#13;
apartment. Many people who have a legal right to be on the list have not bothered to register,&#13;
because they don't expect to get housing from the official waiting lists.&#13;
4/ These figures are net expenses after contribution of user charges, which are now set at 30-35% of expenses for housing&#13;
and co.amunal services, and are scheduled to increase to 60% by 1997. However, as prices have increased, non-payment&#13;
rates have also. Donetsk officials estimate that 30-40% of residents do not pay on time and that 15-20% never pay. 35-&#13;
4055 of the housing in Donetsk has been privatized, but this. does not affect charges paid by residents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
12.   Formerly, a few apartments each year were built in the Raion for the Donetskugol&#13;
Association, which gave money for apartment construction to the City of Donetsk. The city built&#13;
housing and distributed it to various entities in proportion to the capital they had contributed.&#13;
However, even this construction has stopped. Neither have apartments been built recently for the&#13;
Raion's own waiting list, for people who do not work for one of the enterprises. The last people to&#13;
receive apartments from the Raion list were people who had been waiting since 1976. At least half&#13;
the people on the Raion list are pensioners. The only apartment distributions occur when a resident&#13;
emigrates or dies without heirs.&#13;
13.   Miners and retirees living in housing without central heating receive free coal, either 5.9 mt&#13;
or 2.9 mt, depending on the quality of the coal.&#13;

UKRAINE&#13;
COAL PILOT PROJECT&#13;
KRASNIY OKTYABR MINE - YENAKIEVO&#13;
1.    The City of Yenakievo (pop. 183,200) is subordinated directly to Donetsk Oblast. It has no&#13;
raions, and thus the city administration is the organ of local government which will assume re-&#13;
sponsibility for maintenance and operation of housing, kindergartens, and other social infrastructure.&#13;
It has a somewhat diversified economy, with relatively better mines and other industries (especially&#13;
metallurgy) that provide some capacity to absorb redundant coal sector workers.&#13;
1. Technical Issues&#13;
2.    This mine is located in the Central Donbas, where the coal seams are steeply inclined, mining&#13;
conditions most difficult and production costs highest. Mine development and coal extraction have&#13;
been stopped. The mine continues to pump water in order to protect neighboring mines from&#13;
flooding. Since those mines are also uneconomic and have to be closed soon, a low-cost scheme for&#13;
temporary continuation of water pumping from Krasniy Octyabr has been designed. The capital costs&#13;
for this scheme have been included for financing under the proposed loan; the operating costs after&#13;
completion of the project would be covered by UDKR until the neighboring mines are closed. Apart&#13;
from the water pumping scheme, the closing process of the Krasniy Octyabr mine is uncomplicated&#13;
and low-cost.&#13;
2. Social Infrastructure&#13;
3.    The following social assets are associated with the Krasniy Oktyabr mine:&#13;
-     46,000 square meters of housing&#13;
-     3 boilers, with 2.7 km of heating pipe&#13;
-     8.1 km of sewer mains&#13;
-     three kindergartens, with 320 places, and an enrollment of 256 children&#13;
-     one dormitory&#13;
-     one cultural facility, with a total capacity of 350&#13;
-     two sport complexes&#13;
4.    The housing associated with the Krasniy Oktyabr mine is a standard mining settlement,&#13;
consisting mostly of one story detached houses and a few two story buildings. 60% have no&#13;
communal services, such as water and sewer. This is typical of the housing in many mining&#13;
settlements, and is considered considerably less desirable than multi-family apartment buildings,&#13;
almost all of which have water, sewer, heating, and other utilities. The city is now considering a&#13;
specific program to transfer these mine-owned houses to the city administration, and expect that this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
will be done, but know that this will mean an additional operating burden on their already strained&#13;
city budget. Only 30% of the cost of providing housing and communal services is now covered by&#13;
user charges. A single housing maintenance committee ("ZhEK") now serves both the Krasniy&#13;
Profintern and Krasniy Oktyabr mines.&#13;
5.     City housing officials would like to try to encourage residents of detached, one-story homes to&#13;
privatize. However, as elsewhere in Ukraine, the legal obligation of the city or enterprise to&#13;
completely renovate ("remont") housing prior to privatization is a barrier. At this point some 36% of&#13;
the housing in the city as a whole has been privatized, but administrators believe this figure is much&#13;
lower with the mine housing, which is older and in worse condition.&#13;
6.     Three of the four kindergartens formerly associated with the Krasniy Oktyabr mine have been&#13;
transferred to another mine (the Krasniy Profintern mine). One was apparently leased for business&#13;
uses. These three or four kindergartens can be transferred to the city, adding to the city's existing 25&#13;
kindergartens.&#13;
7.     The city has, at least in theory, merged all of the social infrastructure of the Krasniy Oktyabr&#13;
mine with those of the Krasniy Profintern mine, including kindergartens, housing, palaces of culture,&#13;
and even the housing waiting list. They believe they have already rationalized kindergarten&#13;
operations to the extent possible, combining different kindergartens and closing those in deteriorated&#13;
buildings. Children are enrolled where there is room, without regard to their parents' employment.&#13;
The transfer of social assets from unprofitable mines to other mines, or to the city administration, is&#13;
an ongoing process throughout the Donbas region. City officials feel that inter-mine transfers are not&#13;
a real solution. It does not remove the costs from the industry, nor does it solve any problems more&#13;
than temporarily since most of the mines in the area are threatened.&#13;
3. Labor Issues&#13;
8.     The biggest single concern city officials expressed regarding the mine closure is the potential&#13;
unemployment problem, especially for women. Some ten percent of mine workers are women which&#13;
specific skills (clerical, personnel) that are not readily transferable to other mines (as they have&#13;
sufficient surface workers). City officials believe that most underground workers can find jobs at&#13;
other mines. They estimate that some three to four hundred people will not be able to find other&#13;
employment.&#13;
4. Financial Impact&#13;
9.    Apart from the increased burden from operating loss-making housing, city officials do not&#13;
expect significant financial impacts from the closing of the Krasniy Oktyabr mine. City officials in&#13;
Yenakievo do not expect their tax revenues to go down significantly when the Krasniy Oktyabr mine&#13;
closes. They report that the city receives essentially no tax payments from the OrdzhonikidzeUgol,&#13;
the mining association of which K.O. is a part. There is no revenue from value added tax (VAT)&#13;
because there is no VAT on coal. The City receives no enterprise profit taxes because the enterprises&#13;
are all loss-making. The only revenues the city does receive from the mining association are some&#13;
payments on land and some payments for communal services. There may be some indirect lost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
individual income tax revenue from the three to four hundred workers who the city anticipates will&#13;
not find other jobs.&#13;
10.    The city owes significant debts which it cannot pay because of lack of revenues, and is owed&#13;
significant debts by enterprises located in the city, including coal enterprises.&#13;
5. Other Social Commitments&#13;
11.    The mine has a list of some 300 people who are theoretically entitled to housing. Those&#13;
waiting the longest have been on the list since the list since the mid-1980s, and will not want to lose&#13;
their place in line as they transfer to new jobs. The mine list is perceived as better than the city's&#13;
own list, because the city's list has people who have been waiting since 1978.' Although city officials&#13;
have theoretically moved people from the Krasniy Oktyabr waiting list to the Krasniy Profmtern mine&#13;
list (a neighybouring mine). Overall, there are some 6,000 people on various city and enterprise&#13;
waiting lists in Yenakievo, of whom approximately 2,000 are on the city's own list.&#13;
12.    City officials expect to move the names of the Krasniy Oktyabr mine workers from the mine's&#13;
list to the city's list when it closes. During the last three years, the mine has not built any new&#13;
housing and has not paid the city to build any new housing. For the last two years, the city itself has&#13;
built only some 4,000 square meters of housing per year.&#13;
1/ Those persons on the housing waiting lists are not homeless. They are living in crowded situations, with relatives, or in&#13;
other situations that are recognized as inadequate.&#13;

UIRAINE&#13;
COAL PILOT PROJECT&#13;
THE REMOVSKAYA MINE -- SNEZHNOYE&#13;
1.    Like Yenakievo, the City of Snezhnoye (population 95,600) is a city of oblast subordination,&#13;
and has no internal raions. Although the city is physically closer to Lugansk, it is part of the Donetsk&#13;
oblast, and its economic life is integrated with the Donetsk oblast. The city grew out of a collection&#13;
of settlements clustered around mines. Its housing is predominantly village-style cottages with a few&#13;
low-rise multiple family units. The housing stock is the oldest of the three cities, and the city has the&#13;
least diversified economy. There is little employment which is not related to the coal industry, and&#13;
the other mines in the region are generally also old and provide little opportunity for absorbing redun-&#13;
dant miners. This is the most remote of the three communities affected by the pilot project, and the&#13;
most dependent on the mines.&#13;
2.    The Removskaya mine has been in operation since the 1950s. The mine itself employs 1401&#13;
workers, of whom 939 work underground. Production has been decreasing, and mine managers are&#13;
well aware that the mine has nearly exhausted its resources.&#13;
3.    By contrast with Yenakievo, the older mines in Snezhnoye produce anthracite coal which is&#13;
used only for heating homes and has little commercial value. The mines in Yenakievo produce&#13;
coking coal, for which there is at least some demand. Snezhnoye administrators point out that the&#13;
city of Yenakievo is a younger city with a more diverse industrial base, specifically the metallurgical&#13;
factory located there.&#13;
1. Technical Issues&#13;
4.    Removskaya Mine. This mine is located near the southern rim of the Donbas basin where&#13;
anthracite coal prevails. A shrinking market for anthracite and depleted coal reserves require closing&#13;
of this mine. The coal reserves originally planned for exploitation have been depleted years ago and&#13;
the mine has been surviving by recovering coal, in an improvised way, from pillars left behind and&#13;
by starting mining in a thinner coal seam at higher costs. These operations are not sustainable and the&#13;
mine should therefore be stopped, even though its present production costs are not among the highest.&#13;
From the viewpoint of physical closure, the Removskaya mine is the simplest of all three mines and is&#13;
problem-free.&#13;
2. Social Infrastructure&#13;
5.    The social assets associated with the Removskaya mine are shown in Table 1. The mine&#13;
housing is old, and is disparagingly referred to as being 3 stories or less. In Ukraine, multi-family&#13;
apartments are usually considered more desirable than detached "village-style" housing. Some of the&#13;
City's housing dates from 1905, and has not been renovated since. It is generally not served with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
municipal gas lines or other communal services. 40% of the city's housing is connected to sewer&#13;
lines, while the majority uses outhouses.&#13;
6.    The Snezhnoye city administration has two ZhEks. One spends 80,000 krb annually per&#13;
square meter for maintenance. The other spends 95,000 krb. By contrast, the mine ZhEK spends&#13;
some 150,000 krb per square meter. City officials believe this is due to the dilapidated condition of&#13;
mine housing, and the fact that it is inefficient single-family detached housing, not because it is&#13;
maintained to a higher standard. The city administration has eight boilers serving its housing stock,&#13;
while the mining association has 45 separate boilers to maintain for its housing. Because of these&#13;
problems, and because it does not want to inherit the renovation responsibilities for this housing, the&#13;
city administration is reluctant to take over the mine housing.&#13;
7.     All of the housing is maintained officially on the books of the TorresAntrasit mining&#13;
association as a whole. None is officially associated with a particular mine, though physically, it is.&#13;
The TorresAntrasit association owns 406 thousand square meters of housing in Snezhnoye (some&#13;
1,700 houses), slightly less than a quarter of the city's total housing stock of 1,770 thousand square&#13;
meters. Some 37% of the city's housing stock is reportedly privatized, and city officials believe the&#13;
same percentage of mine housing has been privatized.&#13;
8.    Each mine has its own electric substation which serves housing. These substations step down&#13;
the voltage from the high levels used for transmission mains to levels suitable for domestic use. If&#13;
the mines close, the city or the local electric enterprise will have to take over operation and&#13;
maintenance of these substations. Transportation is a problem for kindergartens. People cannot send&#13;
their children to kindergartens 5 to 10 kilometers away in another settlement. Because of distance,&#13;
city officials do not see much opportunity for rationalizing kindergarten operations by combining&#13;
operations.&#13;
9.     As elsewhere in Ukraine, user charges cover perhaps 30% of the cost of providing housing&#13;
and communal services, but the city's large population of pensioners pays only 10% of the normal&#13;
rate, so the cost recovery problem is compounded by the aging population.&#13;
3. Labor Issues&#13;
-      face workers&#13;
other underground workers&#13;
surface workers associated with the mine&#13;
10.   City officials are very concerned about employment opportunities for mine workers once the&#13;
Removskaya mine is closed. Inevitably, they know, at least three other similar mines in the city will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
also have to close. Both city and mine officials feel that the right answer would be to establish a new&#13;
enterprise, perhaps a manufacturing enterprise, at the mine site.&#13;
11.    With four neighboring mines also slated for closure in the next 2-3 years, the city officials&#13;
envision 10,000 potentially unemployed residents. The city of Snezhnoye grew out of a collection of&#13;
eleven separate settlements surrounding specific mines. These sub-communities are 5 to 7 kilometers&#13;
apart. The city is some 30 kilometers across. Each community was always more or less reliant on&#13;
the mine for communal services, distribution of goods, and other municipal functions. The people&#13;
living in the Removskaya region do not have good public transportation links to the rest of the city,&#13;
let alone other cities in the area. Although the city is physically closer to Lugansk, its economic and&#13;
transportation links are with Donetskaya oblast, of which it is a part. There is no train transportation&#13;
for workers to get to jobs in Lugansk oblast or other regions.&#13;
12.   Seven mines have already been closed in Snezhnoye, though their settlements remain. The&#13;
Soviet-era policy when closing of mines was to plan new production at the site, but in fact this has&#13;
not worked, and these isolated settlements are dilapidated.&#13;
13.   Transportation is one of the biggest issues for this city. The city pays some 60 billion krb to&#13;
a State enterprise for municipal bus service, since the Government requires cities to make up&#13;
operating losses from transport services. But the losses result in part from the low levels at which the&#13;
Government sets the fares, and are exacerbated by the fact that some 15 privileged categories of&#13;
citizens pay no fares or only token amounts.&#13;
4. Financal Impact&#13;
14.   As with other cities, the base-line financial condition of Snezhnoye is in poor condition. The&#13;
city of Snezhnoye's 1995 budget was originally set at 980 billion krb ($5.4 million US dollars), but&#13;
was reduced by the oblast to 580 billion krb. Of this, the city was supposed to receive some 330&#13;
billion krb in revenues, principally the so-called regulating revenues, and 250 billion krb in subsidies&#13;
from the oblast. However, this budget does not correspond with reality. For example, at the time of&#13;
our visit, the city of Snezhnoye owed suppliers some 108 billion krb in unpaid debts, principal among&#13;
these some 40 billion krb for water service and some 45 billion krb for energy. Enterprises owed the&#13;
city some 40 billion in unpaid taxes.&#13;
15.   The city officials do not see a direct financial impact from the closing of the mines, because&#13;
they receive few revenues from the mines. As previously mentioned, there is no VAT on coal. In&#13;
the case of Snezhnoye, any enterprise profit taxes would be paid to the city of Torres, where the&#13;
TorresAntrasit mining association is headquartered, rather than to the city of Snezhnoye where the&#13;
mine is located. The city has been taking on more and more civic obligations from the mines as their&#13;
financial picture has worsened, leaving the city in extreme financial distress. There is no money for&#13;
solid waste disposal, drainage, or sanitation.&#13;

16.    All municipal and enterprise lists in the city include some 4,500 people. 1,280 of these are&#13;
on the city's list, 190 on the Voskhod mine list. Each mine maintains its own list. The people who&#13;
have been on both the city's and the mine's list the longest have been waiting since 1978.&#13;
17.   Until three years ago, each enterprise in the city gave the city money for housing&#13;
construction. The city did the construction and assigned units in proportion to the capital contributed.&#13;
But, as in Yenakievo, the enterprises have stopped paying these construction funds, and the city has&#13;
stopped construction. At present, the only way for a person on the waiting list to get an apartment is&#13;
if a resident leaves town or dies without an heir.&#13;
18.   The mine is also supposed to fund "disability" payments worth 160 billion krb per year.&#13;
Because the mine cannot pay, the TorresAntrasit Association has been making some payments, but the&#13;
City says the Association is now 630 billion krb in arrears ($3.5 million U.S. dollars), and that figure&#13;
is growing. City officials are concerned that if the mine is closed, there will be no payments made&#13;
into the city's pension fund. The oblast, which had been making up the shortfall, has notified the city&#13;
that after the end of 1995 they will be unable to help the city meet pension obligations. Pensioners&#13;
are receiving 20% less than their entitlements, because of the shortfall in available funds. Roughly&#13;
thirty percent of the 100,000 residents of Snezhnoye are pensioners. City officials were quite&#13;
concerned about what mechanism can be set up to cover these recurring expenditures.&#13;

SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES&#13;
AND MITIGATION OPTIONS&#13;
Note: This table lists features, impacts and mitigation options which generally apply to closing of underground coal mines. Items relevant to the&#13;
three mines under the pilot project are highlighted in italics. The purpose of this table is to provide a checklist for the preparation of the&#13;

COAL PILOT PROJECT&#13;
Social Portrait of a Miner&#13;
I. Background&#13;
The study was conducted by the Agency for Regional Development and the Regional&#13;
Service for Social Studies of Donetsk in December 1994. The purpose of the study was to&#13;
investigate the social and economic conditions in the coal mining sector in the Donetskaya&#13;
Oblast during the transition to the market economy. Data was collected in interviews with 635&#13;
coal mine employees living in the cities of Donetsk, Khartsizk, Shakhtarsk and Torrez. The&#13;
figures below summarize occupations of the interviewees.&#13;

II. Findings&#13;
*  Attractiveness of the mining profession is high (50% of the interviewees take pride in their&#13;
mining profession, compared with 34 % who said they are unsatisfied).&#13;
*  Reasons for changing careers to the coal mining sector For who entered from other&#13;
industries, reasons for choosing jobs in the coal industry include: lack of other job&#13;
opportunities in the region (43%), better wages (26%), preference for a mining specialty,&#13;
and family tradition (12%).&#13;
*  Reasons for choosin8g car           The respondents who started careers in the mining&#13;
industry have mentioned the following reasons for choosing mining specialties: good wages&#13;
(61 %), influence of relatives (20%) and friends (7%), location of a mine close to home&#13;
(17%), early retirement (15%) and availability of an educational facility (10%).&#13;

* Responsibility for the state of mines As shown below, 63 % of the respondents stated that&#13;
the general manager bears direct responsibility for the state of mines, followed by the&#13;
Government (35%) and the Mining Association (25%). However, respondents believe that&#13;
the settlement of problems related to poor conditions should be initiated directly on the&#13;
level of the mines.&#13;

COAL PILOT PROJECT&#13;
AFFECTED AT-RISK POPULATIONS&#13;
Survey Purpose&#13;
A World Bank team of social scientists sought to identify the different groups of mine&#13;
workers in terms of their vulnerability to adverse consequences from the pilot mine closures. The&#13;
team used labor profile data, in-depth interviews and focus groups with above-ground and&#13;
underground miners, miners' families, mine pensioners, trade union representatives and mine&#13;
management.&#13;
Survey Sample&#13;
A total of 53 interviews were completed at the three mines included in the pilot project:&#13;
Pravda mine; Krasny Oktyabr mine; and Removskaya mine. The respondent sample was selected by a&#13;
trade union representative at each mine. The survey team received the full cooperation of the Oblast&#13;
administration and the mine management at the three mine.&#13;
Levels of risk&#13;
The analysis revealed four levels of risk. The definitions of these levels were informed by&#13;
answers of mine managers, trade union representatives and mine workers to two key questions: 1)&#13;
Who will be hit the hardest by the mine closing? 2) Who will adapt best to the impacts of mine&#13;
closure? Table 1 sununarizes these results.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
Level One: Highest Risk&#13;
A woman, alone, with children, with 70% or more of the family income derived mine wages. This&#13;
person is clearly the most at risk of losing everything.&#13;
L.N'. is 35 years old, and has lived in the community all her life. She has two school age daughters.&#13;
Her ex-husband moved away and provides no child support. She has worked in the mine five years as&#13;
an unskilled above ground worker and earns $32 a month in total family income, all of which comes&#13;
from the mine. Her job will be one of the first to go and is not considered to be transferable to&#13;
another mine. She is very worried about how she will take care of her children.&#13;
Level Two: High Risk&#13;
Other above - ground workers comprise this category. As a general observation, above ground&#13;
workers are considered a highly vulnerable group of workers, not possessing particularly transferable&#13;
skills. All women staff work above - ground, and 83 % of total number of above - ground workers&#13;
(1389) are women; 17 % (285) are men.&#13;
V. C. is 60 years old and has lived 60 years in this community. She has worked 30 years in the same&#13;
mine. She currently works above-ground in the stockyard in an unskilled position. She and her&#13;
husband have a monthly family income of $64, which includes their pensions. Their family income is&#13;
closely tied to the mine and will be cut in half, to about $1 a day, when the mine closes. She is&#13;
frightened when she thinks about it closing. No one will hire her.&#13;
Level Three: At-risk&#13;
Underground workers in the engineering and other professions comprise this group. They are the&#13;
highest risk group of the underground workers.&#13;
V. G. is a 40 year man who has worked 25 years in the mine. He is an electrician underground and&#13;
earns $64 a month to support his wife and two school age children. He is totally dependent on the&#13;
mine - his wife is unemployed and 100% of the family monthly income comes from the mine. He has&#13;
no savings and worries that the mine closing is going to be a disaster for his family&#13;
Level Four: At Risk but mobile&#13;
Underground skilled workers (face miners, drifters, timberers/fitters and coat transport&#13;
workers). These workers have the best chance of adjusting to a mine closing. They are potentially the&#13;
most in demand for their skills and hence the most mobile&#13;
O.Z., 38, has worked underground in the mine for 19 years, most recently handling explosives. 75%&#13;
of his family income comes from the mine. His wife earns $18 a month working in the hospital and he&#13;
is worried that the hospital will close if the mine closes. He earns $88 a month. He is worried about&#13;
the future for his two sons - where will they work ? He has lived in the same community his whole life&#13;
and does not want to leave for another job. His skills raise considerably his chances of getting a new&#13;
job. "&#13;

COAL PILOT PROJECT&#13;
IMPACT ON MUNICIPAL BUDGETS&#13;
1.    The social assets of the three mines set for closures comprise 238,500 sq. meter of housing, 8&#13;
kindergartens, 6 cultural facilities, 2 sports facilities and one profilactoria.&#13;
Housing&#13;
2.    The housing provided by the mines to its employees is managed by the mining associations&#13;
and its cost is comprised in the mining associations balance sheet. The housing transfer of the three&#13;
mines set for closures to the municipalities, will decrease the associations' housing cost as follows:&#13;
Pravda mine's housing transfer will decrease 10 percent of the total housing of Donetskugol mining&#13;
association, the Removskaya's mine housing will reduce 5 percent of the housing of Torezantratsit&#13;
association and mine Krasniy Octyabr 11 percent of the housing of Octyabrugol associations. The&#13;
attached tables show the percentage of housing to be transferred in relation to the existing housing in&#13;
receiving cities.&#13;
3.    The Pravda mine housing will be transferred to the communal property of the city of Donetsk&#13;
which manages the housing funded by the city budget. The Proletarsky Raion administration where&#13;
the Pravda mine is located has approval authority for the housing transfer but the housing is not&#13;
funded by the Raion budget. Housing associated with the mine represents 1 percent of the Donetsk&#13;
city housing.&#13;
Kindergartens&#13;
4.    Kindergartens owned by the mines are located in small rural settlements administratively&#13;
attached to the cities; the kindergartern belonging to the mine is usually the only one in each&#13;
settlement. These kindergartens provide services to all children of the community and some are open&#13;
24 hours daily. Fees are about Krb 600,000 per month (about $3.20 p.m.). Certain categories are&#13;
exempt from paying fees (e.g. single, unemployed mothers). As a result of mine closures, it is&#13;
expected that children's attendance will decrease by about 20 percent as parents who become&#13;
unemployed choose to keep their children at home, rather than pay the monthly fees. Some cost&#13;
reduction measures may be implemented by the municipalities such as discontinuing 24 hour service&#13;
and reducing some personnel (currently the payroll accounts for one-third of costs; food accounts for&#13;
one-third and utilities for one third).&#13;
Cultural and Sport Facilities&#13;
5.    Cultural and sport facilities owned and operated by the mines are the only of such facilities.&#13;
The facilities comprise theaters, libraries, sports rooms and meeting rooms. These facilities and&#13;
services could be restructured to increase community service and cost recovery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
Profilactoria&#13;
6.    The Removskaya mine profilactory has a capacity of 75 beds, and provides miners with&#13;
preventive treatments for professional diseases during a stay of twelve to twenty four days. During&#13;
the treatment miners continue to work in the mine while they return to the profilactory for lodging,&#13;
food and treatment. The municipal health system does not provide such services. Profilactoria&#13;
facilities may be rationalized by discontinuing food and lodging services once the mine closes, and&#13;
moving medical treatments to the nearby municipal health clinic. The two floors building may be&#13;
used for other purposes by the municipality.&#13;
Transfer Cost&#13;
7.    The attached tables show inventory and yearly recurrent cost of the three mines's social&#13;
assets, as well as the total amount to be financed by the World Bank. The total recurrent costs&#13;
amounts to US$ 1,114,844 and three years of financing in a declining basis of 75 , 50 and 25 percent&#13;
will represent US$ 1,672,262.&#13;
City of Snezhnoye&#13;
8.    The comparison of 1995 municipal budget shows an increase in expenditures increase of 28&#13;
percent over the budgeted, which was covered by a treasury loan. The city's actual expenses for the&#13;
year 1995 were US$ 5.9 million with the shift in line items budgeted expenditures showing a decrease&#13;
in housing and an increase of expenses in education, health and culture.&#13;
9.    The transfer of the social assets of Removskaya mine would represent an increase of 7 percent&#13;
of the 1995 actual expenditures.&#13;
Yenakievo&#13;
10.   The comparison of 1995 municipal budget shows an increase of 18 percent of expenditure&#13;
over the budgeted, which was mostly covered by a two-fold increase of profit tax, and 51 percent of&#13;
wage tax. The city actual expenses for 1995 were US$ 10.3 million.&#13;
11.   The transfer of the social assets Krasniy Octyabr mine would represent an increase of 4&#13;
percent of 1995 actual city's expenditures.&#13;
Proletarsky Raion&#13;
12.   The raion's actual expenditures are 87 percent over the budget with a shortfall of US$ 6,151&#13;
million. The education and culture facilities represent less than 1 percent of the 1995 actual&#13;
expenditures.&#13;

COAL PILOT PROJECT&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Assistance the Govermnent of Ukraine&#13;
Support to the Ukraine State Company for&#13;
Restructuring Coal Industry Enterprises (UDKR)&#13;
1. Background&#13;
1.    As an integral part of the conversion of the Ukrainian economy from the centrally planned model&#13;
to a market basis the national coal mining industry is undergoing a fundamental restructuring. The&#13;
progress is Intended to lead to a coal sector that is economically and financially viable, satisfying&#13;
domestic demand for coal of the qualities available within Ukraine without government subsidy. There&#13;
is general acceptance that closure of a number of mines will be necessary either because the reserves arc&#13;
exhausted or because the casts of operating prohibit rational continuation of exploitation.&#13;
2.    Mine closure under the central planning regime was a rare occurrence, only permitted when&#13;
reserves were entirely exhausted and generally then only when a replacement mine was developed both&#13;
to replace the output lost from the closing mine and to employ the displaced miners. There is thus very&#13;
little experience of closing mines within Ukraine, and what d - Cs exist relates to conditions under which&#13;
a choice of actions did not need to be economically justified.&#13;
3. The Ukrainian government has now agreed an action plan for coal industry restructuring. This includes&#13;
market liberalization and restructuring the corporate structure. It also involves a plan to close mines. The&#13;
aim is to close at least X mines during 1996 and thereafter to close remaining un-economic mines as&#13;
efficiently and as quickly as possible.&#13;
4.    The World Bank have prepared a pilot 3 mine closure project with the aim of preparing practical&#13;
guidelines and best practice for mine closure and are expected to follow this up with another mine closure&#13;
project to finance the costs of closing another 24 mines. Funds provided by tho Bank will be provided&#13;
for local cost financing through the budget. Funds are expected to cover the costs of technical and&#13;
environmental support, lump sum payments for transferring employees (of mines and the social sphere),&#13;
and other related costs to be defined during the pilot (e.g. for existing disability labilities, severance&#13;
payments).&#13;
5.    To manage the mine closure process the Ukraine have decided to establish a Ukrainian Coal&#13;
Company (UDKR) closed modelled along the lines of British Coal Enterprise (BCE). UDKR will take&#13;
prime responsibility for the actual closure of the mines and will be responsible for the design and&#13;
implementation of programmes to mitigate the social and economic aspect of mine closure. This is likely&#13;
to include redundancy counselling and outplacement advice as well as direct interventions in the labour&#13;
marker.&#13;
6.    Like BCE, UDKR is expected to take a strong "partnership" approach to its task, working closely&#13;
with local authorities and other key local players in the regions affected by closure and acting as a catalyst&#13;
for regional regeneration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

7.    UDKR will have its headquarters in Donetsk and a Chief Executive has already been identified.&#13;
2. Objectives&#13;
8.    The objective of this technical assistance project is to assist with the establishment and operation&#13;
of UDKR The KHF will provide advisory (and; if required, executive) support to UDKR over two years&#13;
The main aim is to ensure a socially responsible and cost-effective mine closure programmne.&#13;
3. Scope of Work&#13;
Phase I&#13;
9.    Tho first phase will provide support to establish the UDKR. This will involve:&#13;
Defining the key functions and mission statement of the UDKR (in particular separation of&#13;
responsibilities between UDKR and MCI)&#13;
Assisting UDKR Chief Executive agree these functions with key players including MCI and local&#13;
authorities&#13;
Defining the organization and staffing structure of UDKR, this will include preparing detailed&#13;
job    descriptions&#13;
Assist UDKR recruit key staff&#13;
Preparing a business plan&#13;
Preparing and agreeing with UDKR Chief Executive a programme of continued technical&#13;
assistance including detailed job descriptions and skills requested&#13;
Assisting the KHF and UDKR tender for this long term programme of support&#13;
Providing continued high level management support to UDKR until the full time team is in place&#13;
Phase II&#13;
10.   The exact detail of Phase II will emerge during Phase l. But the following support is expected&#13;
to be provided:&#13;
(a) Management and Financial Control&#13;
General advice to management to run the new organization efficiently establish efficient financial&#13;
management systems, transparent and effective financial systems will be especially important if&#13;
the UDKR channels the payment of subsidies to employers of redundant miners, payments to&#13;
local authorities for social sphere costs and other direct budget transfers.&#13;
Assist UDKR develop an effective communications approach with the Mining and local&#13;
communities most affected by closure. This is expected to be a highly participatory approach&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 12&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
allowing feedback and is not just a PR exercise. The arm is to reduce uncertainly and anxiety about&#13;
mine-closure and the social change it requires and to involve the local communities in key decisions&#13;
11.    Assist UDKR develop a Public Relations strategy. This will include a strategy for dealing, with&#13;
the press and the broadcast media and other aspects of PR intended to generate wider support for the&#13;
mine-closure programme.&#13;
12.    Advice will bc provided from consultants experienced with communications and PR in the FSU&#13;
context (successful examples include work on voucher privatization and land reform in Russia).' A&#13;
working knowledge of Russian or Ukrainian will be essential.&#13;
13.(c) Redundancy. Job Creation and Regional Regeneration&#13;
14.    The existing Action Plan includes the outlines of a scheme for dealing redundancies caused by&#13;
mine closures. The scheme, based on flat rate payments to employers for taking on redundant miners,&#13;
will be tested through the 3 mine pilot programme. UDKR will need to develop the capacity to monitor&#13;
and evaluate the results of the pilot and to implement redundancy job creation schemes. The scheme&#13;
which the pilot will test has been influenced by World Bank policy and not by demonstrated successes&#13;
in or West European context.&#13;
15.    The Protocol with the Bank has agreed that a wider study of regional regeneration and Job&#13;
creation should be undertaken (probably by the Ministry of Economy) but the UDKR will need to be able&#13;
to influence and interact with this work.&#13;
16.    The consultants should assist the UDKR Co develop both policy understanding and practical&#13;
implementation capacity to deal with redundancy, job-creation and wider regional regeneration issues.&#13;
Subjects to bc covered include:&#13;
o      Redundancy counselling&#13;
o      Outplacement and job search, support to labor mobility&#13;
o      Job creation through SME support schemes (eg loan guarantee, equity&#13;
o      Job Creation through other mechanisms (eg subsidy to new employers)&#13;
o      Broader partnership approaches to regional regeneration based an European approaches&#13;
to local development including methods of working with the emerging private sector and&#13;
local authorizes&#13;
(d) Social Sphere&#13;
Bidders should look at the Know How Fund and IFC experience with PR and communications work in Donetsk Land&#13;
Privatization programme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 12&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
The UDKR is expected to take: responsibility for ensuring the smooth transfer of the social&#13;
sphere to Local municipalities. The World Bank projects will fund the additional costs to&#13;
municipal budget. The UDKR will need to develop the capacity to plan and organize the transfer&#13;
of services and possibly to train new municipal managers. It will also need to deal with&#13;
unemployed social sphere workers.&#13;
17.   Particular issues include how to deal with housing transfers. Consultants should&#13;
have similar expcrience of social divestment from other projects in the FSU.&#13;
(e) Technizal Mine Closure Issues&#13;
*     Definition of the options for closure or merger of mines and/or their reserves and&#13;
facilities;&#13;
*     Planning the underground works and facilities associated with mine closures and/or&#13;
mergers, including consideration of the viability of salvage operations and of the need for&#13;
scaling against water and gas migration; consideration of pumping installations and their&#13;
cost implications on adjacent mines to ensure that closure of one mine does not add an&#13;
unnecessary burden to others.&#13;
3     Consideration of the possible subsidence regime after mine closure and the potential need&#13;
for mitigation, either by prevention or by installation of drainage or other systems.&#13;
3     Planning of the shaft sealing operations and of its impacts;&#13;
3     Planning of the site conversion process, including choice of installations to he demolished&#13;
and those to be retained;&#13;
3     Costing of all the above, including estimation of the labour requirement and the time for&#13;
which it will be required;&#13;
*     Preparation for announcement of the impending closures on a mine by mine basis.&#13;
The consultant will be required to give consideration, on the basis firstly of closure plans&#13;
prepared by Ukrainian specialists and later of plans revised in the light of the consultant's advice, on the&#13;
desirability of setting up special peripateic mine closure action teams with a view to minimizing the time&#13;
and cost entailed in a mine closure operation.&#13;
(f) Relationship with World Bank&#13;
18.   The UDKR will be responsible for implementing the pilot and full mine-closure projects. The&#13;
technical assistance provided to UDKR by the KHF will strengthen capacity to undertake the pilot and&#13;
to monitor and interpret results from the pilot but the KHF advisers will not have any direct responsibility&#13;
for implementation.&#13;
Separate direct implementation support for the pilot is being considered by the KHF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4. Effort&#13;
19.   Phase I Bidders should recommend an approach to Phase I The KHF expects that it will require&#13;
at least five weeks of intensive input for the first organizational stage and continued support of about 2&#13;
weeks a month until the full team is in place.&#13;
20.   Phase II. The KHF is willing to support up to five full time advisers (or the equivalent from a&#13;
mix of full time and short term support) to the UDKR for the first year of operation and to continue this&#13;
support at a lower level during the second year.&#13;
21.   Bidders should recommend an approach to this work. Bids should be made for both Phases I and&#13;
II on the understanding that the exact details of Phase II will be renegotiated after Phase I design work.&#13;
Continuity between Phases I and II is essential.&#13;
22.   Skills Required [to be added]&#13;
5. Reporting, Work Planning&#13;
23.   Short monthly workplans to the UDKR will be prepared by the consultant and copied to the KHF&#13;
and the World Bank.&#13;
24.   All documentation will be provided in Russian and English at the expense of the contractor.&#13;
25.   Short reports to the UDKR will be written after each visit and copied to the KHF and the World&#13;
Bank task manager. The reports will be submitted within seven working days of the period covered in&#13;
the report.&#13;
26.   More detailed reports to the KHF will be prepared quarterly.&#13;

SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
Being a pilot project, supervision is expected to require a more intensive input than normal.&#13;
About 20 staff-weeks per fiscal year during the first two years of implementation and 10 staff-weeks&#13;
in the third year are required. A formal mid-term review involving senior government officials will&#13;
be carried out in mid-1996 to review progress on implementation, including actual stages of the&#13;
closure of the three mines.&#13;
The schedule below indicates supervision plan and required resources in addition to regular review&#13;
requirements for procurement actions, progress reviews and various correspondence.&#13;

EXPLANATIONS&#13;
A. Economic Costs and Benefits&#13;
(t) Production Costs include free coal but no other social costs and no taxes (for tonnages see separate sheets for individual&#13;
mines: Costs of Local Coal Production vs. Imports.&#13;
(2) Materials, energy and services for raw coal production of mines (real increases due to worsening geology and gradual&#13;
lifting of input prices to international levels).&#13;
(3)  Economic wages are assumed to represent 50% of actual wages.&#13;
(4) Costs of cleaning and transporting local coal to domestic consumers (declining due to declining production).&#13;
(5)  Costs for maintenance &amp; operation of social infrastructure carried by the mines.&#13;
6  Present economic value of closure and mitigation costs at time of producton stop determined by depleted coal reserves.&#13;
(7)  Local coal delivered at domestic consumers at import parity price (based on imports from Russia; assumed to adjust&#13;
gradually to international levels; for tonnages see separate sheets for individual mines: Costs of Local Coal Production vs.&#13;
Imports).&#13;
(8) In the first year of project implementation, 60% of the coal is assumed to be still supplied by the closing mines.&#13;
(9)  In the first year of project implementation, 40% of the coal is assumed to be imported.&#13;
(10) Costs of sealing-off underground workings, filling the shafts, demolishing surface structure and cleaning the site.&#13;
( 1) Excluding all severance and other transfer payments.&#13;
(1 2) Costs of transport (or relocation) of workers who continue to work in other mines (10-40% of workforce, depending&#13;
on mine).&#13;
13)  Workers and pensioners not connected to district heating receive 6 tons of free coal per year, valued at import&#13;
parity (free coal is included in the production costs of the "without"case).&#13;
(14) 2 years disbursement, 3 years grace, 10 years repayment in annuities with 2% real interest and 30% failure rate.&#13;
(15) Costs for maintenance &amp; operation of social infrastructure taken over by the state.&#13;
(16) Annual operating costs of $ 300,000 assumed, which together with the technical assistance program are equally&#13;
distributed to the three mines (if no more mines were closed in fututure, continuation of UCC beyond 2000 would not&#13;
be justified).&#13;
(17) Wages paid to miners which are transferred to other mines, find new employment outside the coal industry or are self-&#13;
employed (economic costs are assumed to repesent 50% of previous actual wages, identcal to line (3)).&#13;
(18)  Following percentage of workforce assumed to be transferred: 40% at Removskaya, 20% at Krasnyi Octyabr, 10% at Pravda.&#13;
(1 9) Includes ex-mine workers who find new employment outside the coal industry or are becoming self-employed as well as&#13;
miners ('future miners') who would have entered the coal industry in the 'Wthout' case as replacement for retiring miners.&#13;
(20) Same quantity of coal delivered at same economic price as in the "without'case.&#13;
(21) Economic value created by new employment.&#13;
(22) For transferred miners, this value assumed to be equal to their wages (no value added).&#13;
(23) For workers which find employment outside the coal industry or are self-employed, a value added of 25% is assumed.&#13;
B. Fiscal Impact&#13;
(1) Difference between (financial) costs of local coal producton (incl. cleaning and distribution) and delivery of imported coal&#13;
to consumers. This difference includes social costs and taxes (for details on individual mines see separate sheets: Costs of&#13;
Local Coal Production vs. Imports).&#13;
(2) Present (financial) value of closure and mitigation costs at time of production stop determined by depleted coal reserves.&#13;
(3)  Contributions to state pension fund and other social funds.&#13;
(4)  Taxes charged on the output of mines.&#13;
(5) Difference between costs of local coal production and imports during the first year of project implementation (mines still&#13;
producing 60% of their previous annual output).&#13;
(6) Present financial value of the mine closure and mitigation costs at the time of production stop due to depletion.&#13;
(7)  Includes most essential social services previously provided by mines.&#13;
(e) Equivalent to total economic costs of social mitigation (see Economic Costs and Benefits Sheet).&#13;
(9) Disability payments taken over by the state in same amount as initially provided by the mines in the "without' case (but no&#13;
increase due to addition of further incidents).&#13;
(10) Costs for maintenance &amp; operation of social infrastructure taken over by the state initially in the same amount as provided&#13;
by the mines in the "without" case. Phasing out of state support assumed over a period of 10 years.&#13;
(1 1) Same administrative costs assumed as in economic analysis (see note (14) of economic analysis).&#13;
(12) Assumed to be 70% lower than in the "without case".&#13;
(11) Assumed to be 80% lower than in the "without case".&#13;

COAL PILOT PROJECT&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Social Impact Monitoring and Evaluation of Coal Pilot Project&#13;
1.     Background: The following draft terms of reference on scope of work for the design and&#13;
implementation of a social impact monitoring program shall be reviewed and revised as necessary by&#13;
a designated Government of Ukraine Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) team or staff members. Due&#13;
to its important administrative role in the social mitigation program of the pilot project, the Ukrainian&#13;
State Company for Restructuring Coal Industry Enterprises (UDKR) will assume the major&#13;
responsibility for the social monitoring program, in close consultation with the Bank and other&#13;
Ukrainian specialists. Periodic social assessment research and participatory discussions and&#13;
workshops with the mining communities during the course of the project will build upon the&#13;
information based collected by the UDKR. The technical assistance anticipated from the UK Know-&#13;
How Fund to build capacity at the UDKR will focus, among other things, on a detailed manual of&#13;
"operations and procedures" which will guide the UDKR's role in the social monitoring program.&#13;
2.     The small, pilot nature of the Bank's first investment in Ukraine's ongoing coal restructuring&#13;
effort offers a valuable opportunity to learn first hand about the direct and indirect social impacts of&#13;
mine closures, as well as the effectiveness of various social protection measures, social asset&#13;
transfers, and employment-creation measures. The social monitoring and evaluation of the pilot&#13;
mines will help guide the design and implementation of the Government's restructuring program and&#13;
help to shape Bank assistance to the sector (i.e. a larger investment project and sector adjustment&#13;
loan).&#13;
3.     Obiectives: The general objectives the Pilot Project's social impact monitoring program are&#13;
multiple: (i) to ensure that workers are informed of the mine closure schedule and their rights to&#13;
information, consultation, benefits, and options on a timely basis per existing regulations or law; (ii)&#13;
to ensure that individual and household benefits under Ukraine law are distributed on time to all&#13;
eligible workers under the project by various responsible line agencies; (iii) with the transfer of social&#13;
assets from the mines to the municipal governments, to ensure the delivery of services to eligible&#13;
workers and their families, including free coal subsidy, housing, education, health, etc; (iv) to ensure&#13;
that full assistance through public information, job counselling, and retraining is offered to interested,&#13;
redundant workers regarding new employment possibilities (i.e. in adjacent mines, in private firms, in&#13;
microenterprise, or public works; (v) to document the process of affected party consultation and&#13;
participation in decision-making about options and outcomes of the intended social mitigation plan at&#13;
the mines; (vi) to establish a functional mechanism for handling any grievances in the program,&#13;
possibly through a Petitions Department at UDKR; (vii) to identify constraints in quality and&#13;
functioning of the elements in the system and make necessary changes; (viii) to build up capacity in&#13;
the UDKR as an institution that can administer, coordinate, and monitor benefits and service delivery&#13;
to affected workers under the project; (ix) to evaluate the actual social impacts of restructuring&#13;
through the Mine Closure Plans and compare them to the relative impacts of non-Bank assisted coal&#13;
and other sector reform programs ongoing in Ukraine.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 17&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
4.     Social Protection Plan: An important component of the Pilot Project's social mitigation&#13;
program relies on the Ukrainian legal social protection system. For specific monitoring of its various&#13;
benefits, it was agreed that the Ministry of Coal Industry and/or the Project Steering Committee&#13;
would intervene if necessary to ensure the monthly flow of records from appropriate line agencies to&#13;
UDKR. The designated M&amp;E staff or team of UDKR will assume the responsibility of confirming&#13;
eligibility, information collection and management, and systematic communication of social&#13;
monitoring information to the Bank team. For the first 4 months of the project, to ensure that the&#13;
basic social safety benefits are being delivered on time to all those eligible, information should be&#13;
collected and communicated to the GOU-Bank team every month. If the system is functioning well&#13;
after the first 4 month period, quarterly monitoring can resume. As an example, the following&#13;
information on social safety protection will be documented and sent by the responsible institution to&#13;
the UDKR, and conveyed to the GOU-Bank project team:&#13;
(i)    Severance payments: UDKR will be the "temporary" employer of the three pilot&#13;
mines at closure, and is responsible for directly delivering the one-time severance&#13;
payment of 3 months average salary to each worker at the time of redundancy.&#13;
Workers who are transferred to other mines do not qualify.&#13;
(ii)    Pensions: The local branches of the Ministry of Social Protection provide monthly&#13;
pension payments. The Ministry branch offices will provide monthly accounts of&#13;
beneficiaries to UDKR.&#13;
(iii)   Disability: These benefits are paid by two sources. The local Ministry of Social&#13;
Protection is responsible for payments and records to UDKR on those eligible from&#13;
genetic or non-work related disabilities. The Mining Associations were previously&#13;
responsible for disability transfers to those injured on the job. This responsibility will&#13;
now be transferred to UDKR. The source of revenue for this benefit, formerly raised&#13;
by coal production at the mine, will need to be derived by neighboring, open mines in&#13;
the Association or by an alternative source.&#13;
(iv)   Unemployment: The local Employment Fund office is responsible for the&#13;
administration and distribution of funds to those eligible for unemployment benefits&#13;
after the 3rd month of severance is completed (and for as long as a year or more).&#13;
This office will provide monthly records to UDKR to monitor payments to eligible,&#13;
redundant workers. Pensioners in the mining sector do not qualify.&#13;
5.     Coal Subsidy and Employment Creation: A second major component of the Pilot's mitigation&#13;
program that requires social monitoring involves Bank financing of free coal subsidies to eligible&#13;
redundant workers and households, and investment in employment creation options, including: i)&#13;
reemployment support; ii) microcredit fund; and iii) public works program. Responsibility for&#13;
quarterly coal purchase and distribution to eligible households lies with the UDKR. Monitoring of&#13;
this benefit will be undertaken by the Ministry of Coal and the Bank. UDKR will receive funds for&#13;
the administration and monitoring of the reemployment support program, which involves benefits of&#13;
$600 in installments to private employers that hire and sustain the employment of ex-mine workers,&#13;
or benefits of $600 directly to those mine workers who can prove they have initiated their own private&#13;
business. In the case of the private employer, funds of $300 will be paid 3 or 6 months after payroll&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 17&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
records and field verification prove employment is valid; the second $300 installment will follow at&#13;
12 months. For the self-employed, a 3-month record, supported by field verification, of successful&#13;
self-employment will justify the $600 payment. Administration, supervision and monitoring of the&#13;
microcredit funds to individuals will be undertaken by the selected financial intermediary. Full&#13;
information about availability, criteria, applicants, types of businesses, needs for technical assistance,&#13;
repayment records, program constraints, and success cases will be collected for UDKR and the Bank.&#13;
The small public works program will be administered by each municipality. Criteria and proposals&#13;
for job creation in environmental amelioration and for the equitable selection of ex-mine workers will&#13;
need to be transparent and sensitive to gender equality. In collaboration with municipal officials, the&#13;
UDKR will monitor the employment records, productivity, and sustainability of activities.&#13;
6.     Social Assets and Services: A third component to be monitored involves the transfer of social&#13;
assets and services from the mining enterprise to the municipal governments. The assets will be&#13;
immediately owned by the municipality at the time the mines designated for closure are transferred to&#13;
UDKR. The municipality will work closely with the UDKR to ensure the smooth acquisition of&#13;
assets such as housing and kindergartens, and to ensure the timely delivery of services to individuals,&#13;
households, and community.&#13;
7.     Technical Services: The fourth component involves specific technical service activities which&#13;
have been identified as essential to support the project's social objectives. These include: (i) periodic&#13;
social assessments which help generate and inform monitorable indicators; (ii) local participation&#13;
programs with stakeholders, especially affected workers, mine management, and municipalities; and&#13;
(iii) a public information program at local, regional and national levels. Finally, the quality and&#13;
reliability of the social monitoring program itself should, if possible, be annually monitored by an&#13;
outside Ukrainian research institution with no prior affiliation to the project.&#13;
8.     Preliminary Monitoring Indicators: Indicators will be further defined and modified during the&#13;
ongoing process of social assessment and participation by affected parties in the mining communities&#13;
and other stakeholders. Where appropriate, all monitoring should include gender disaggregations.&#13;
Measurements on the effectiveness of implementation will need to be taken at appropriate levels of&#13;
individuals, households/families, communities, or regions. The following is a preliminary list of&#13;
indicators. The indicators are either linked closely, or related to, the variety of social mitigation&#13;
measures under the Pilot Project.&#13;
o      access to timely information on mine closures, redundancy, and worker employment&#13;
and other alternative income options (project and non-project supported);&#13;
o      access to adequate, timely compensation by social protection plan per existing laws&#13;
(severance, disability, pension, unemployment benefits);&#13;
o      access to mechanism for grievance and/or legal recourse;&#13;
o      adequacy of cooperation and support from line agencies at local, regional, national&#13;
levels;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 17&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
o      access to employment information, job counselling, training/retraining, and&#13;
transportation support;&#13;
o      access to availability and support ($600) for reemployment with private firm or self-&#13;
employment opportunity;&#13;
o      access to information, technical guidance, financial support (up to $5000), and&#13;
supervision for microcredit;&#13;
o      access to information and availability of municipal public works jobs in environmental&#13;
amelioration (or other sector);&#13;
o      timely receipt of payment transfers to municipal governments to support acquisition&#13;
and management of new social assets and services;&#13;
o      access to and affordability of basic social services before and after transfer to&#13;
municipalities, including: housing and communal services; sport and cultural facilities;&#13;
health/profilactoria; kindergartens;&#13;
o      availability and timeliness of quarterly delivery of coal subsidies by municipalities to&#13;
those eligible;&#13;
o      ability to restore level of individual and household income, and maintain standards of&#13;
living re: housing, utilities, and services after mine closures;&#13;
o      numbers of redundant workers re-employed, income levels pre and post closure,&#13;
service level changes, attitudes;&#13;
o      numbers of redundant workers remaining unemployed, income levels pre and post&#13;
closure, attitudes, coping strategies;&#13;
o      impacts of mine closures on individual, family, community health, and environmental&#13;
health (physical, accident, psychological);&#13;
o      impacts of mine closures on mine and non-mine businesses, new business startups and&#13;
expansions, retraining rates, credit access;&#13;
o      utility and adequacy of periodic social assessments to support project objectives, and&#13;
inform mid-course adjustments;&#13;
o      efficacy and representativeness of local participation program, including participation&#13;
panels/committees as mechanisms for project decision-making and M&amp;E;&#13;
o      utility of public information program to generate constituency support for project&#13;
implementation.&#13;

9.     Methodology: There will be a variety of inputs from primary and secondary research, and&#13;
participatory processes, that will inform the social impact monitoring effort. Ukrainian studies and&#13;
others conducted by a variety of local institutions will be gathered, analyzed and built upon. As&#13;
currently planned, the next phase of the joint GOU-Bank social assessment will entail rapid multi-&#13;
disciplinary appraisals of social conditions at each pilot mining community. This qualitative work&#13;
will guide the design of a statistical household survey which will be conducted this summer to&#13;
establish baseline date for future monitoring at each mining community. A related study will entail&#13;
longitudinal, in-depth case interviews of vulnerable groups and other affected workers who have both&#13;
voluntarily departed and who have been made redundant by the pilot mine closures. These&#13;
individuals will be tracked and interviewed every 6 months for 3 years. Another component of the&#13;
analysis will involve matching pairs, to compare project-affected mine workers with those who have&#13;
departed voluntarily with no special mitigation package and those who continue to work at&#13;
neighboring mines. Comparisons across the different mining communities will be important to&#13;
highlight contextual differences and adequacy of social mitigation responses. Data sets will be&#13;
disaggregated by gender based on indications that women workers, and possibly their children, may&#13;
be among the most vulnerable of those affected by the mine closures. The participatory workshops&#13;
and participation panels at each mine will provide valuable, systematic grass roots information on&#13;
project design and implementation. Involvement of a locally based NGO in Donetsk is under&#13;
consideration by the team to assist with the participation program, and to play a neutral monitoring&#13;
and evaluation role.&#13;
10.   Institutional Framework: A network of Ukrainian social researchers to support the pilot&#13;
project social assessment and monitoring, as well as future investments, is currently in an early stage&#13;
of identification. Valuable experience and contacts were gained by the Bank during the recent&#13;
fieldwork by Ukrainian institutions on the Poverty Assessment. Considerations include scientists from&#13;
institutions such as Kharkiv University Department of Sociology and the Kiev Institute of Sociology,&#13;
possibly NGOs, identified social scientist staff from the ministry of Coal, the Donetsk Oblast&#13;
government, local agencies such as the Regional Information Center, the UDKR, and the participation&#13;
committees at the three pilot mines. These individuals or groups will collaborate with the Bank team&#13;
to determine more specific social impact indicators (once more social analysis is complete), to&#13;
measure and record impacts and adjustments, and disseminate results to GOU-Bank project&#13;
management. The UDKR will assume the primary role in managing the social monitoring program.&#13;
The Bank project team will also undertake its standard supervision missions two times annually, with&#13;
a special view to evaluating the efficacy and adequacy of social mitigation measures in the project.&#13;
An annual evaluation of the project and the social monitoring program may be conducted by a&#13;
Ukrainian research group that has not been involved in the project.&#13;
11.   Demonstration: The social monitoring plan in the pilot is part of the project's larger&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation program. The pilot should offer important insights for the Government's&#13;
restructuring program and for Bank assistance projects. If the social mitigation program is adequate&#13;
under the pilot, monitoring should show the following: (i) social protection measures under Ukrainian&#13;
law can be effectively distributed to eligible beneficiaries by government institutions and can help&#13;
cushion the economic impacts of unemployment; (ii) local social impacts from coal restructuring are&#13;
not more severe, but in fact less so by means of effective social mitigation, than restructuring impacts&#13;
in other industries (mine-non-mine comparison) (iii) affected ex-mine workers, families and coal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 17&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
communities are better protected from adverse social impacts with the Bank-assisted project than&#13;
without the Bank's intervention (baseline comparison); (iv) no particular vulnerable group(s), such as&#13;
older pensioners, women workers, workers above age 35, children, double mine-income households,&#13;
or the disabled, nor a particular settlement, is relatively more damaged as a result of the project; (v)&#13;
effective consultation and participation of stakeholders at the mines translates to influence over&#13;
decision-making about the project, and longer-term participatory mechanisms for project inputs,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation prove effective at each mine; and (vi) adequate public information that is&#13;
timely and systematically disseminated helps mitigate social disruptions and build support for coal&#13;
reforms.&#13;

            Ukraine - Coal Pilot Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The central objective of the Coal Pilot
            Project is to mitigate the social and environmental
            consequences that arise from the government's decision
            to close uneconomic coal mines, as part of government's
            overall restructuring program for the coal sector. The
            project seeks to: 1) test ways to implement the
            government's decision to close mines safely, with due
            regard to technical, environmental, economic, financial and
            social aspects; 2) ensure that mine workers are afforded
            opportunities to either transfer to other jobs in the sector
            or exit the industry with reasonable compensation and a
            choice of assistance for seeking other employment; 3)
            transfer social assets to municipal management, support
            their rationalization and help ensure that adequate social
            protection measures are put in place to support the most
            vulnerable people; and 4) through monitoring and feedback,
            gain experience from the project for subsequent bank
            assistance operations in the sector. The project consists of
            the following five components which will serve as the basic
            framework for mitigation initiatives in subsequent sector
            operations requested by the government: 1) mitigation of
            mine closure including physical closure and environmental
            mitigation; 2) social mitigation; 3) social infrastructure
            divestiture; 4) institutional strengthening and job
            counseling; and 5) technical assistance.
