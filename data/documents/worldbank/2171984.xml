about 97 per cent of the habitation&#13;

estimates put it at around 50 per&#13;

worse, with less than 20 per cent of&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The national and state Governments of
            India face the challenge of providing the poor with
            efficient services, and substantially increased access to
            sufficient quantity and quality of water, and sanitation
            services. The Government of India has introduced a national
            policy that promotes the financing and management of rural
            drinking water and sanitation services at a decentralized
            level. A third of the national funds are earmarked for
            capacity-building of the local government and communities.
            This program would increase the access of the poor to safe
            and sustainable water and sanitation services, which in turn
            would assist in economic growth and wealth creation. The
            institutional development of local government, and
            capacity-building for institutional reforms are the
            challenge for the success of the reform process. The
