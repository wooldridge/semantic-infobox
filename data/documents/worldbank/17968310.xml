                                   November 2, 1985&#13;
                                                                                ALDEWERELD:       Since I was on a monetary restraint, so to speak, I&#13;
                                   Robert W. Oliver&#13;
                                                                                finished my studies at the age of 20, with a degree that was not a&#13;

                                                                                Doctor's degree, but equivalent to a Masters degree plus two years oÂ£&#13;

                                                                                post-graduate studies.       That's the best way to COIDpare.&#13;
     OLIVER:   Hay we begin, Mr. Aldewereld, by my asking how you came to&#13;
                                                                                OLIVER:    Still, a very early age.&#13;
     the Bank in the first place?     Perhaps you would also say a word about&#13;
                                                                                ALDEWERELD:       It was in 1930; it was just the beginning of the&#13;
     your pre-Bank career.    Eventually, I want to ask about your career in&#13;
                                                                                depression.     Here I was an economist, fresh from the University, and&#13;
     the Bank, including your experience in India.&#13;
                                                                                could get no other job than a manual job in the Rotterdam Bank in&#13;
     ALDEWERELD:   I will be glad to answer these questions.    With respect&#13;
                                                                                Amsterdam.    My salary was very low.&#13;
     to India, I would like to think about that country. not in isolation.&#13;
                                                                                          Shortly thereafter, sterling devalued, resulting in very&#13;
     but in terms of possible comparison with my experience in other&#13;
                                                                                volatile fluctuations from one hour to the next.        At that time I was&#13;

     OLIVER:   Well, 1 hope that you will speak by way of comparison.&#13;
                                                                                international banking.      I was then, 11aybe, 22.   Ever since I have been&#13;
     ALDEWERELD:   Your first question was:    "How did I get to the Bank?"&#13;
                                                                                constantly involved in the international aspects of banking until&#13;
     OLIVER:   I think you were at the Bretton Woods Conference, were you&#13;
                                                                                today.&#13;
     not?&#13;
                                                                                OLIVER:    It is a fascinating subject ''until today" also.&#13;
     ALDEWERELD:   No.   I was"born in Amsterdam in 1909, of a very poor&#13;
                                                                                ALDEWERELD:       In the 30"s, I saw what happened to international loans&#13;
     family, extremely poor.     My father did not even finish his elementary&#13;
                                                                                -- the miserable way in which it was done.        Mr. Goering (Hr. if we can&#13;
     education because his father died and he had to support my grandmother&#13;
                                                                                dignify him with the word "Mister") opted for guns rather than butter.&#13;
     and his many brothers and sisters.    That"s why my father felt that his&#13;
                                                                                In 1940, Hitler invaded Holland.       My wife and I had just become&#13;
     son should have a good education.    This may be a roundabout way to&#13;
                                                                                married, and,      because we are Jews, we tried to escape.     We did escape.&#13;
&amp;#12;    ,.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              3                                                                          4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
married, and, because we are Jews, we tried to escape.          We did escape.    sent a cable instructing me to go to New York to do the same job for&#13;
&#13;
We were taken to England by a small freighter. and there I met my                 the Netherlands East Indies assets.    There I met in the office where I&#13;
&#13;
former boss, Mr. Beyen..      Have you ever seen his name?                        vas assigned, a man called Crena de    long~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Yes, indeed. I have read his book.      ~in       .1. Maelstrom.       OLIVER:   Whom you had never met before?&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:    He was my mentor and my teacher in banking.                        ALDEWERELD:   Oh yes, I knew him from the Netherlands.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    And the first Executive Director, if I am correct, in the              OLIVER:   All right.&#13;
&#13;
World Bank for the Netherlaoda.                                                   ALDEWERELD:   I was appointed to a position, which, in American terms,&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:    That's right.     Aod also the first loan director on an           would be called a staff me.ber of the General Accounting Office.        My&#13;
&#13;
interim basis.     With the invasion of the Netherlands, many Dutch               task was to supervise the conduct of affairs by the representatives in&#13;
&#13;
companies, like Philips and Royal Dutch, had transferred their legal              the U.S. of the business of Dutch East Indies companies.     As was also&#13;
&#13;
headquarters fraa the Netherlands to Curacao in the then Netherlands              the case in Curacao, the government had a fiduciary responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
West Indies.     Sio~e   Holland was occupied by the Germans, the assets of       OLIVER:   I understand.&#13;
&#13;
these companies in the United States and in the other Allied Nations              ALDEWEKELD: During the war, when I 1 ived in New York, the ideas of the&#13;
&#13;
would have been frozen without the transfer of their legal                        Keynes Plan and the White Plan were widely discussed.      I had become a&#13;
&#13;
headquarters from occupied Holland to a free part of the Kingdom of               member of a study group of Dutch people in New York who debated the&#13;
&#13;
the Netherlands.     An enormous amount of assets,     located throughout the     post-war monetary systea.    Such debates undoubtedly occurred among&#13;
&#13;
world, belonging to Dutch companies, were freshly incorporated in                 numerous groups all over.    Then Bretton Woods came.    Crena de Iongh&#13;
&#13;
Curacao-- a .. all island that I recall had a foreign exchange budget             waa one of the Dutch representatives and Aron Broches was the&#13;
&#13;
of $20,000,000 a year.                                                            Secretary to the Dutch delegation.     Since I was Crena's deputy in the&#13;
&#13;
          Beyen asked me to go to Curacao in the capacity of Secretary            Dutch Government's office in New York, I had to mind the store while&#13;
&#13;
of the Foreign    Exchange~ COI!Diasio~.   whose function vas, among other        he vas in Bretton Woods.    He had often asked for my views ant.l 1 had&#13;
&#13;
things, to supervise the management of the assets of these companies.             given him some ideas, including that if a bank were to be&#13;
&#13;
By the ti.e the organization for this purpose was in place and                    established, it should supervise its loans.     This idea was shared by&#13;
&#13;
functioning, the Japanese invaded what then was called the Netherlands            many others, because of the serious mistakes and abuses by&#13;
&#13;
East Indies.   Soon thereafter the Dutch Government in exile in London            international lenders during the period between the two     ~orld   wars.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                           5                                                                                6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Therefore, it was felt very strongly that if, for instance, a loan                         One will observe, when one reads the Articles .Q!, Aueement of&#13;
&#13;
would be made for locomotives, and the railroad itself would not be              the Bank, that there are two provisions, which in this context are&#13;
&#13;
built 1 the locoaotivea would not be used; they would be rusting in the          extremely important:       one is   (I   don't quote verbatim) that, except in&#13;
&#13;
jungle.      I was "Mister Projects."                                            exceptional circumstances, the Bank shall â&#128;¢ake loans for specific&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      1 understand.                                                       projects only; the second ia (I think I quote verbatim) the Bank shall&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWEIELD:     So then the Bretton Woods Institutions were born and             make arrangements to ensure that the proceeds of any loan shall be&#13;

Crena de Iongh was asked by Eugene Heyer to becoae the first Treasurer           used for the purpose for which the loan was granted, with due&#13;
&#13;
of the World Bank.      Crena then asked me whether I would 1 ike to join        attention to considerations of economy and efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
him in the World Bank as assistant to the Treasurer.        I remember I was     OLIVER:    Yes.&#13;
&#13;
interviewed in the fall of 1946 by Eugene Meyer, and I was hired                 ALDEWERELD:       When I was asked to set up the disbursement system, I was&#13;
&#13;
effective December 2. 1946, because I first had to finish some work in           guided by these two specific provisions.          I realized, apart from what&#13;
&#13;
New York..    You will see Brochea and you will see Lester Nurick..       Dick   the law said, that since the Bank had only a limited paid-in capital&#13;
&#13;
Demuth you have seen.        They joined the World Bank about two or three       and a big back-up guarantee, we had to raise substantial financial&#13;
&#13;
weeks before I did.      I came there three weeks after them.                    resources by tapping capital markets.          I kne"'â&#128;¢ therefore, being in the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      You came about the time Hr. Meyer resigned.                         Treasurer's Department, that in one capacity or another I would be&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:     Ho.   Hr. Meyer resigned three weeks later.     Because of my    involved in raising that money.           If then you combine "'hat I said about&#13;
&#13;
later entry, Lester Hurick, Ronnie Brochea and Dick Demuth, though               the use of proceeds and the need to raise money, it is clear that this&#13;
&#13;
they may personally like me, consider themselves as having come on the           would involve a very great responsibility in the way we handled other&#13;
&#13;
Mayflower and look at me as a recent refugee.        It shows you bow far        people's money.&#13;
&#13;
back we go.                                                                                When the Bank issued ita bonds, we often heard welcomed&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:      I think you wete all on the ground f 1 oar.                         coaments such as:      The State of California has bought $25 million.&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:      Oh yea, maybe in the basement.   We worked for such low         What did this mean?       Not that the rich State of California had lent&#13;
&#13;
salaries, it vas the bargain basement.        Hy boss was Crena, and wy          $25 million to the Bank.      No, it meant that the retirement fund of the&#13;
&#13;
first assignment, as Assistant to the Treasurer, was to set up a                 State of California had invested that amount on behalf of the           State~s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
disbursement system for loans we had not yet made.                               civil servants, to be repaid to the State at the time the money was&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         7                                                                                8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
needed to pay pensions to those civil servants after they had retired           the private banking sector -- as I did before the war for 10 years.&#13;
&#13;
   to a teacher in Oakland, a fireman in San Francisco or a policeman           In '74 I became a partner of Lazard Frere&amp;     &amp;   Co â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ one of the big&#13;
&#13;
in Los Angeles, all hard working people.       1 felt from the very             investment banks.    There I observed again that it is not the big shot&#13;
&#13;
beginning that when we borrowed from other people, we had a fiduciary           with $100 million who buys World Bank bonds.       He buys IBH shares, or&#13;
&#13;
responsibility that their aoney be well spent.      Having been poor            other shares, or be puts his money into big office buildings. It""s&#13;
&#13;
myself, I felt the need to help poor people.       These were JAY clients,      retirement funds, or pension funds (managing mostly small people's&#13;
&#13;
in India, or wherever.                                                          money) that buy our bonds.   Obviously, you have that same&#13;
&#13;
           The poor people in the United States are better off than poor        responsibility for rich people too.     Do you understand what I mean?&#13;
people in India, but their bed ia not full of roses either.                     OLIVER:   Yea indeed.&#13;
&#13;
Sometimes, when I beard about grandiose plana,      Â·~e   have to do this and   ALDEWERELD:    When I started to set up a disbursement system, it was&#13;
&#13;
th&amp;ti money is no object," 1 said that I wished the people who made             uppermost in my mind, that, while I had to disburse money to those&#13;
&#13;

ALDEWERELD:      Exactly.   Maybe not so poor, but still poor people.           ALDEWERELD:    Crena knew a man who was a high official in a New York&#13;

&#13;
developed ideas of how to get the cooperation of commercial banks all       OLIVER:    I understand.&#13;
&#13;
over the world for the disbursement of the proceeds of our loans.           ALDEWERELD:    These arrangements are incorporated in the Disbursement&#13;
&#13;
What we worked out is that a loan frc. the World Bank, as far as its        Procedures; in fact they are part of the Loan Agreement.         The result&#13;
&#13;
diaburseaent is concerned, should in fact be regarded as a gigantic         baa been that the Bank could process substantial amounts of&#13;

&#13;
submission of satisfactory documentation that the money is, or will be      OLIVER:    This all sounds reasonable and logical.&#13;
&#13;
used, for the purpose spelled out in the Loan Agreement.                    ALDEWERELD:       I transferred to project work in 'S2 1 in which I was very&#13;
&#13;
          We knew that, if we bad to do all this ourselves in Washington    much involved until George Woods came to the Bank.       George said, "I&#13;
&#13;
for projects all over the world, the World Bank would have to recruit       know you are very much involved with projects and I'd like you to&#13;
&#13;
and maintain a very large staff.    It should be observed that bank&amp; are    continue doing this.       In addition, I want you also to take&#13;
&#13;
regularly doing that sort of thing -- making payments against letters       responsibility for finance."      There are certain policy aspects of&#13;
&#13;
of credit- routinely all over the world every day.       So I got the       finance, for instance:      when to borrow, where to borrow and how much&#13;
&#13;
idea,   if we make a loan to, say, Brazil or India, for the purchase of     to borrow.    This is distinct from the day-to-day operations of the&#13;
&#13;
locomotives (after international competitive bidding) and the contract      Treasurer's Department.&#13;
&#13;
provides for 10 percent down when the order is placed, the rest at                    Eugene Black, who was for 14 years the President of the World&#13;
&#13;
later intervals, the borrower, on the basis of the loan from the World      Bank, was also his own Vice President of Finance.       Black was the&#13;

&#13;
the locomotives -- in the United States, in England, or France, or          little regard for rigid orgknizatiooal linea) had consulted me&#13;

satisfied that the documents submitted are in order, it will pay out        side.    He said:    "I have been an investment banker all my 1 ife, and&#13;

commissioned a well known accounting firm to review that system, to             functions of supervision of projects, carried out by the Treasurer's&#13;

requirements of good management.      They made the study and concluded         Department, were merged into a newly formed Projects Department.&#13;

OLIVER:     Well, you have nov told me how you came back to f ioance.           soon, thereafter, Director of the Projects Depart~nt.       That merger&#13;

&#13;
what was originally a limited basis to what later became a more                 ALDEWERELD:    1 organized the Department into several functional&#13;
&#13;
comprehensive one.    Shall I tell about projects nov'l                         divisions:    Public Utilities, Transportation, Industrial, Development&#13;

OLIVER:     Yes, please.                                                        Banking, Agriculture.     I had attached to the Director's Office an&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:    Until the creation of the Projects Department, the               engineering adviser by the name of General Spec Wheeler.&#13;
&#13;
projects work, such ae it was, was divided between the then Loan                OLIVER:   I met General Wheeler in 1961.&#13;
&#13;
Department and Econo.ics Department.        The Economics Department was        ALDEWERELD:   Until the creation of the Projects Department, some&#13;
&#13;
under Leonard Rist and the Loan Department was under Charles Pineo              people in the Bank had looked at a given project from a single point&#13;
&#13;
first and then under Stanley Hoar.      At that time already, and here I        of view, say engineering, others from another single point of view,&#13;
&#13;
am not exactly clear about the time, it was felt that the Bank needed           say finance, but nobody evaluated a project in a comprehensive manner.&#13;
&#13;
an engineer to satisfy itself that each project was physically sound.           Since I am both a banker and an economist, I said to my staff:       '"This&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         13                                                                                 14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
is entirely unsatisfactory and unacceptable.        I want to know whether        practically no maintenance.     I can thus conclude that it would cost me&#13;
&#13;
the project is sound.     We have to bring together several disciplines."         2 cents a mile over 40 years to go in a Rolls Royce from Massachusetts&#13;
&#13;
In the first place, it is important to know whetb~r the project makes             Avenue to my office.     On the other hand, if I buy, say, a Ford and I&#13;
&#13;
sense from an engineering point of view.     Will the dam be built in             take into account ita much aborter life, the need for frequent&#13;
&#13;
such a manner that it will not collapse?     Whereas this can be taken            maintenance and the high gas conaumption, then I could calculate that&#13;
&#13;
for granted moat of the time in a developed country, it is a riskier              it would coat ae 3 cents a mile to go free my home to the office.          The&#13;
&#13;
proposition in countries that are in an early stage of development.               choice is, therefore, clear.    It is cheaper to have a Rolls Royce than a&#13;
&#13;
Apart from the engineering of a project, there are many other                     Ford.&#13;
&#13;
questions.     How about the project's econcmica7    How can we establish                    However, if I buy a Rolla Royce, I would have to spend $20,000&#13;
&#13;
how much it costa?     How reliable are the coat estimates?      What are the     and a Ford would only coat $2,000.    Buying a Rolla Royce would,&#13;
&#13;
benefits going to be?     Are those the optimum benefits?                         therefore, mean that I could not afford to buy clothes to wear, a&#13;
&#13;
           Once we know the dam is safe, once we know it coats so much.           chair to sit on or, for that m.atter, any other necessities of 1 if e.&#13;
&#13;
once we know the dam will generate so many kilowatt hours, that they              In other words, I am too poor to afford the cheapest.     The reason is&#13;
&#13;
coat one penny per kwh to produce, and that they can be sold for a                that the cheapest requires an immediate, massive, monolithic investment,&#13;
&#13;
penny and a half, can it then be concluded that the dam is a good                 whereas the moat expensive form of tranaportation would allow me to&#13;
&#13;
project?     That depends; it then becomes a matter of economic judgment.         spread sever a 1 sma 11 investments over a long period of time.    This&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     It"a at least financially feasible.                                   principle, the economics of alternative investments, is a very&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:     Yea, but is it also economically justified?      That's the       important feature in the appraisal of projects.     It determines the&#13;
&#13;
difference.     I once explained this difference to McNamara, and in              choice, for instance, between hydro or thermal power, between road&#13;
&#13;
doing so I might have touched a sensitive nerve.        I 1 ive, 1 said to        transport or rail transport, between irrigated or rain-fed&#13;

&#13;
the car will be good for thirty or forty years and then can be resold             associates:     look at the project from all these points of view.    No&#13;

ALDEWERELD:       Ho, I mean juat the reverse.   When I retired, he was        exercise the same strict judgment on the economic policies and future&#13;
&#13;
doing a job on projects which was much more refined -- a very able             policies of a given country as the Projects Department did for the&#13;

man..   That was why Warren in his book wrote to me:      ''You started it     projects.&#13;

all."                                                                          OLIVER:     Was there any discussion in those days of the relative roles&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Did you get involved in conversations with people who took           of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
the point of view that the important thing was simply to give balance-         ALDEWERELD:    Yea, there was some discussion at the time.       The subject&#13;
&#13;
of-payments loans to countries?                                                relates to the real essence of development.       It is a subject of&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:       Very much so.   Professor, I was generally opposed to that   worldwide importance, then and also today.&#13;
&#13;
because it is contrary       to the spirit, if not the letter, of the          OLIVER:     (Even, the United States Treasury is beginning to think so.)&#13;
&#13;
Articles ..2.! Agreement.    I consider the Articles as the Bank's             ALDEWERELD:    Yea.    If there is an international organization (it can&#13;

the economic position and prospects of those countries, then that           sovereignty. The Bank's objective is clear and vitally important, but&#13;

organization inescapably must come to the conclusion that, if a             the   e:~~:tent   to which it can be achieved may well be 1 imited.        I think&#13;

country is in bad financial and economic shape, something might be          the reason an Economics Department, as 1             descri~d,   was never formed,&#13;

wrong with ita econoaic and financial policies.     There is no country     was that, .aybe subconsciously, there was apprehension of being&#13;

still remains the feeling among borrowing countries that the                dedicated mao,        says to those countries:       "You do this and   don~t   do&#13;
&#13;
activities of interna.tional financial organizations infringe on their      that."    This advice frcm the Managing Director of the IHF is&#13;

into effect an austerity program more severe than Jacques de Laroaiere           to the policy that economic activities, which by their nature are&#13;
&#13;

Lieftinck     vas criticized to the point of being very much disliked by         should also earn an adequate fioancial return.       The Bank has,&#13;

his fellow citizens.        He told them:   "I am raising taxes ao that we       therefore. for instance in caaes of the financing of electric power&#13;

for the country"&amp; recovery.        And, very importantly, the prescription       OLIVER:   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
came from a fellow Dutchman - Lieftinck.        To a foreign expert. and.        ALDEWERELD:      That's what we did consistently.   However. now consider&#13;

therefore. an outaider1 people might have said. or the Parliament                another unlikely situation.      If a major world industrial power wanted&#13;

doomed to failure. but only that formulation and implementation of               small, if not trivial, in the context of the country''s entire&#13;

ALDEWERELD:    That to me is the problem.      This same sort of problem may     the project's relative importance, those same covenants, though&#13;
&#13;
even occur on the projects side.        It is one thing for the World Bank       equally realistic, might be considered politically unacceptable,&#13;
&#13;
to negotiate the financing of a project that looms very large in the             because of the project's relative insignificance in the total economy&#13;

OLIVER:   Yea, that might well be the case.                                   ALDEWERELD:     The original distinction of the Fund lending short and&#13;

ALDEWERELD:    In other words, it is easier to win a battle from the          the Bank lending long has. indeed., become more nebulous.      All the&#13;

OLIVER:   No, no.   I think that is quite right.   If you have to choose      OLIVER:     Of the two organizations?&#13;
&#13;
between the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, however,          ALDEWERELD:     Yes.   To give you another exaJDple of how things have&#13;
&#13;
to give this Arch Angel-Einstein-type advice on the subject of fiscal         changed over time 1 when Bank and Fund were founded. there was a&#13;
&#13;
policy and monetary policy so that the underlying economy is sound as         reason why the President of the Bank should be an American and the&#13;
&#13;
a background for good project work, which would you prefer?      Do you       Managing Director of the IHF a European.       The rationale was that at&#13;
&#13;
think that that really is the function of a Bank as distinct from the         that time that the only capital market in the world was in the United&#13;
&#13;
Fund at all?                                                                  States.    Wall Street was the only source of funds available to the&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:     It is the function of both.   When we think of the            Bank..    It was felt 1 and rightly so 1 that the Bank 1 to be acceptable to&#13;
&#13;
original concept (putting it in my own words) that the Fund is                Wall Street 1 should be beaded by an American, who could more easily&#13;
&#13;
concerned with aborter perspective balance-of-payments matters and the        establish the Bank's credit than a person of other nationality.          Gene&#13;
&#13;
Bank with longer ten. investments, then we must conclude that economic        Black was the choice RAK excel lance.      On the other hand, the basic&#13;
judwaent ia needed on both the abort-and long-term prospects of a             problem the monetary field at that time waa that of the weak European&#13;
&#13;
countrYâ&#128;¢ economy.    To arrive at this judgment 1 economic work of the        currencies.    Everybody was concerned about the dollar gap; the&#13;
&#13;
highest order should be done by experienced professional economists.          . problema lay with pounds and Belgian franca and French francs and 1 ire&#13;
&#13;
Consequently, I think that much can be said for at least merging the          and guilders.     It was felt then that since the big problem for the IHF&#13;
&#13;
economic work of both organizations.   This would lead to increased           was to cure the â&#128;¢onetary ills of Europe 1 there was a need for a&#13;

operational economy and efficiency.    At the moment the IHF is moving        European of prestige to head that organization.&#13;

into longer term financing.                                                              Now the second act -- the '"80s. What do you see7   Monetarily&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Wet't. for ita part, the Bank is moving somewhat more in the        speaking, it could be argued that the problem now lies with the&#13;
&#13;
direction of aborter-term balance-of-payments lending    ~ith   its           dollar.     There is now a dollar glut and not anymore a dollar gap.       The&#13;

funds for the Bank have substantially shifted away from Wall Street to        nature might also be encountered in a merger between the IHF and World&#13;

head the IMF and for a non-American to be in charge of the World Bank.        guarantee the funds necesaary to finance the imports of a country even&#13;

Ague 11 i 1 Fiat' a Cbaiman, baa on aeveral occaaiona expressed his view      OLIVER:    I take it, at the time, many people in the Fund thought so&#13;

     him.   Gene was the raiser of money and George was, in investment              staff for a number of years.    You had set up very carefully a&#13;
&#13;
     banking   te~s,    on the buying aide not the sales aide.    Gene was the      mechanism for judging the engineering competence, for taking care of&#13;

&#13;
     at 1818 H Street because, if not, you are apt to sell it."                     ALDEWERELD:   He did not add to the methodology, no.      Be said '~hat we&#13;
&#13;
               Then George Woods succeeded Gene.      George, as I said, vas a      have been doing up to now, namely, waiting for borrowers to come to us,&#13;

&#13;
     lending and to put more contents into it.                                      for good projects.&#13;
&#13;
               Black and Woods were both executives of the highest calibre.         ALDEWERELD:   Yes, but active does not describe it fully.     The role of&#13;
&#13;
     I rate then equally; that's why I said, there is a ti11e for everybody.        George Woods was also to establish development consciousness by&#13;

     The tUDe bad come for the buyer to follow the seller, and, thus, it            putting more depth into the Bank's lending.      r11   give you an example.&#13;
&#13;
     was logical for George to put his mark on the Bank's development               We had been at odds with Brazil.     There were many reasons for this&#13;
&#13;
     activities.                                                                    regrettable state of affairs.    Differences of view between the Bank&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER:    All right,   but   you yourself were already heavily involved in    and Brazil over the direction and tempo of the allocation of financial&#13;
&#13;
     doing this.                                                                    resources, conceptual differences about the role of the public and&#13;
&#13;
     ALDEWERELD:    Yea, I was, but I benefitted greatly from George's              private sectors in development, developaent priorities, etc. etc. The&#13;
&#13;
     leadership.    He had the concept that, while we were on the right             result was, unfortunately, that the flow of Bank funds to Brazil had&#13;
&#13;
     lending track,     it was necessary to broaden the scope of lending and to     been reduced to a trickle.&#13;

&#13;
                One day the Economic Minister of Brazil came to visit George         Aldewereld to go to Brazil to work out with you and your associates&#13;
&#13;
     Woods, and George asked me to join them.     The minister said:     ''I know    the organization of such a study."&#13;
&#13;
     the reasons why you are reluctant to expand lending to Brazil.        We do               The minister agreed and shortly thereafter I proceeded to&#13;
&#13;
     not entirely agree, but we recognize your strongly held belief.        The      Brazil, where I reached agreement on the scope and contents of the&#13;
&#13;
     fact is that this state of affairs is an obstacle standing in the way           study.    A big international team of eminent e::.:perts was formed that&#13;
&#13;
     of our economic development.     A most iaportant part of our economy is        started work soon thereafter and in due course submitted its report.&#13;
&#13;
     the transport sector.    The porta are in very poor shape; the railroads        It focussed on many policy and procedural problems.      These problems&#13;
&#13;
     are losing astronoaical amounts of money; and the road system needs             were discussed with the Brazilians and many of them were resolved to&#13;
&#13;
     substantial expansion and improvement.     Is there any way to get out of       our mutual satisfaction.    As a consequence lending to Brazil picked up&#13;
&#13;
     the impasse?"                                                                   considerably.&#13;
&#13;
                George thought for awhile and then said, "Hr. Minister we feel                 I give you this example as a way of describing George    Wood~.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     that our position of holding back on lending to Brazil is correct.              The Bank had done sector studies before, so they were not something&#13;
&#13;
     However~    it can be argued that if the transport system could be              entirely new. but George, while always keeping his feet firmly on the&#13;
&#13;
     improved, this would result in substantial economic benefits to                 group, put his own mark of creativity. quality, comprehensiveness and&#13;

     Brazil.     Therefore, despite the Banl(s reservations about many of            audacity on the study.    Thie to me was development banking of the&#13;

     Brazil's policies, I propose that we move ahead by organizing a                 highest order.    Does that answer your question?&#13;

     study should also cover what specific projects should be carried       out~     people working in the Projects   Department~   that they should do over&#13;

which, to my mind, is the hallmark of a good executive.                             cheap money and, therefore, it is not important, as would be the case&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    In the mid 1950s there waa some discussion in the Bank of the            "'ith a Bank loan, that our standards are maintained.      In such a&#13;
&#13;
concept of "Absorptive Capacity."        Before there was an IDA. there was a       hypothetical situation the staff member "'ould have been disciplined&#13;

sort of thing we were talking about?         Was Woods able to say to his           with borrowers and the increased availability of technical assistance&#13;
&#13;
staff, '\le need to seek more ways of making loans because we nov have              from many outside sources, multilateral and bilateral, absorptive&#13;

conceaaional than World Bank terms, which are also concessional.               As   more access to financial resources.     Black did a great fund-raising&#13;

&#13;
in the past, but he expanded and added.             He broadened and increased            investment banking may provide a particularly happy background for a&#13;
&#13;
the Bank"'a activities.       He did not suppress one activity in order to                person to be a president of the World      Ban~&#13;

create    soothe~    He made the Bank's lending activities more                           ALDEWERELD:     I agree.&#13;

c0111prehensive.    Woods did all that without departing frc:a the basic                  OLIVER:    And investment banking may be preferable to commercial&#13;

principle that the Bank should remain a sound banking            organizatio~             banking or the law.&#13;
&#13;
If I may characterize Woods (that's after all what you're interested                      ALDEWERELD:     Yea, although with some qualifications.    First. the&#13;
&#13;
in) I could put it as follows:           be came fraa a poor background and,              separation between commercial and investment banking is a phenomenon&#13;
&#13;
therefore, knew what poverty meant.          He worked himself up to be a                 limited to a few countries, notably the United States.      Even with this&#13;
&#13;
first-rate investment banker.         Everything that he achieved in life was             separation it always will remain a matter of people.       In most if not&#13;
                                                                                  11&#13;
because of bia own efforts.        Like that advertisement on television,          1:ie   all countries of continental Europe this separation does not exist.&#13;

OLIVER:     "He earned it.''                                                                        Since World Bank presidents have always been Americans. the&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:     He earned it.     Yes,    indeed.                                         nature of the European banking system has had no practical&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I understand all that, but I think you have made a very                       significance.    Second, Black came to the World Bank from a high&#13;
&#13;
important point in addition.       While he was an investment banker, he                  position in a commercial bank, the Chase.      I understand. however, that&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     be got his start in investment banking, after which he moved into the&#13;
&#13;
     bond business of the Chase.      Maybe that's why Black always struck me&#13;
&#13;
     aa an investment banker.      Having said all this, my answer is, '"Yea."     I&#13;
&#13;
     feel that inveataent banking provides a particularly happy background&#13;
&#13;
     for a president of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER.:    So that both Woods and Black, who came fro. that tradition,&#13;
&#13;
     were outatandiog presidents of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     ALDEWERELD:    Yea, they were outstanding.    Black and Woods and in that&#13;
&#13;
     sequence.     rd like to ask you a question (you know the answer):       Do&#13;
&#13;
     you think Woods could have preceeded Black?&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER.:    Ho, I think it is quite clear that it was important first to&#13;
&#13;
     eatabliâ&#128;¢h a .arket for the Bank's bonds.      If the Bank doesn't have&#13;
&#13;
     anything to lend, the project work can't progress.&#13;
&#13;
     ALDEWERELD:    1 fully agree with you.    I joined the Bank in 1946 and I&#13;
&#13;
     retired in 1974.     I was very fortunate to spend 28 years of   ~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     working life vitb tbe Bank.      It vas a period of great satisfaction and&#13;
&#13;
     fulfillaent.     Tbe nineteen years of the Black and Woods regiae, fr011:&#13;
&#13;
     1949-1968, vere tbe moat satisfying and fulfilling of all.       I am bold&#13;
&#13;
     enough to think that vas because of our cc.aon background - banking.&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER:     I understapcL   I wonder if this would be a good point at&#13;
&#13;
     which to atop our first conversation and look forward to our second?&#13;

            In November 1985, Siem Aldewereld was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Dr. Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure
            at the Bank from 1946 to 1974, Mr. Aldewereld worked in the
            following areas: as assistant to the treasurer of the World
            Bank; in the department of technical operations as assistant
            director (1952-1955) and as director (1955-1972); as vice
            president of the World Bank and the International
            Development Association (IDA) (1965-1968); in the projects
            department as director (1968-1969); and as vice president of
            finance (1969-1974). His transcript concerns his work as
            director when he organized the department of technical
            operations into several functional divisions and introduced
            project evaluations in a comprehensive manner. He also
            discusses the relative roles of the International Monetary
            Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in the context of the United
            Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
            proposal to ease the creditworthiness of borrowing countries.
