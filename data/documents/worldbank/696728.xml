REPUBLIC OF CROATIA&#13;
FARMER SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:            Republic of Croatia&#13;
Executing Agencg:    Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry&#13;
Beneficiary:        Private farmers&#13;
Amount:              US$17.0 miilion equivalent&#13;
Terms:               17 years, including five years of grace, at the level repayment of principals&#13;
(LRP), at standard IBRD variable interest rate.&#13;
Objectives:         The project would support the transition of the agriculture sector by providing&#13;
technology-related support services that are relevant to the private farmers. The&#13;
aim is to improve the income of the private farming community and increase its&#13;
productivity and hence the competitiveness of the sector. The project would (i)&#13;
change the delivery of technical services to the private farming community and&#13;
(ii) restructure and strengthen institutions to meet the needs of a market&#13;
economy.&#13;
Description:        The proposed project consists of six components: (i) Extension, (ii) Research,&#13;
(iii) Animal Health, (iv) Pasture and Fodder Development, (v) Seed Industry&#13;
Development, and (vi) Policy Analysis Support.&#13;
The project would:&#13;
(i) modernize agriculture practices and farm management through private and&#13;
public agriculture extension involving farmers in the services;&#13;
(ii) improve the applied agriculture research management system ensuring&#13;
farmers' participation in the formulation of the research agenda;&#13;
(iii) strengthen the private and public veterinary services and, in particular, the&#13;
epidemiological services;&#13;
(iv) assist in the development of the country's grassland and pasture potential;&#13;
(v) provide the regulatory and institutional framework for the seed industry; and&#13;
(vi) improve the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry policy analysis and&#13;
formulation capabilities; and strengthen the agriculture data base available to&#13;
policy decision-makers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
Benefits:            Private farmers will be the principal beneficiaries, gaining advantage from&#13;
improved production technology and animal health services, a strengthened&#13;
regulatory framework for the seeds industry, and from government policies and&#13;
services more conducive to the development of a vigorous private agricultural&#13;
sector. The project would contribute to improving living standards in rural areas&#13;
in which small-scale agriculture is a major employer and source of income. The&#13;
project will also generate substantial public benefits: disease control and livestock&#13;
product sanitary inspection will reduce losses; and improved agricultural&#13;
production and policy would foster better resource utilization.&#13;
Risks:               The potential resistance at the operational level by the various Government&#13;
institutions and services involved in the project to give up traditional influence&#13;
and responsibilities following their reorganization is a risk associated with the&#13;
project. This would be addressed through a substantial training program for the&#13;
staff of these institutions with a focus on farm community participation and on&#13;
the rationale for the changes introduced under the project. Associated to this is&#13;
the risk of a slow establishment of an Agriculture Research Council and a&#13;
National Seed Authority. This is being addressed through considerable technical&#13;
assistance provided both during pre-project start-up using Japanese grant funds,&#13;
and during early project implementation to work out procedures and to assist&#13;
these nascent institutions. A second risk lies in the number and size of&#13;
procurement contracts to be implemented during the first project years; to&#13;
mitigate a procurement specialist has already been hired to compile the major&#13;
packages to be procured during the first project year. A third risk during&#13;
implementation stems from limited farmer capacity to form and support private&#13;
associations, and the potential limitations of extension and research staff to evolve&#13;
with the market economy. This risk will be counteracted by project activities&#13;
which will focus technology development on efficiency increases, improved farm&#13;
management practices and product diversification; the assurance of unequivocal&#13;
Government support to farmer associations and farmer guided extension and&#13;
research services; and a focus of project design on farm community participation.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA&#13;
FARMER SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
CHAPTER I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    Croatia's agriculture economy was stagnant during the 1980's and declined sharply at&#13;
independence due to war and the associated loss of land and livestock resources. The origin of the&#13;
stagnation in the 1980's lies in the economic policies of the former Yugoslavia: an inequitable division&#13;
of resources between the private and the social sectors, inadequate fiscal and monetary policies,&#13;
over-capacities in agro-industry, and domestic market protection. Agrarian policy was not, however, as&#13;
rigidly collectivist in Croatia as in countries under central planning. For instance, Yugoslavia's&#13;
Constitution of 1974 allowed unlimited leasing of land, and by the end of the 1980s the limit on land&#13;
ownership had been raised to 30 ha; the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia places no limit on the&#13;
size of private landholding.&#13;
1.2   Private farming enjoyed government support in the former Yugoslavia only to the extent that it&#13;
benefited the social and cooperative agro-industrial subsector. Agricultural technology development was&#13;
focused on large scale farming and aimed at production maximization, paying insufficient attention to&#13;
economic sustainability. While some private farmers adapted this technology to meet their needs, most&#13;
learned and applied technology which is now widely recognized as being inappropriate in a market&#13;
economy. Although a body of technology exists and more can be gleaned from the practices of successful&#13;
private farmers, there remains the need to restructure and reorient the agriculture knowledge system. This&#13;
includes rebuilding its structure and management, giving it a market focus, making it responsive and&#13;
accountable to the private farming community and ensuring its future financial sustainability. Other&#13;
support services, such as veterinary services, and the regulatory framework for the seed industry require&#13;
considerable institutional reforms in order to overcome the legacy of the past and to increase participation&#13;
of the private farming community. Policy formulation capabilities need to be developed in order to ensure&#13;
more rational agriculture policies.&#13;
1.3   The Croatian Government is committed to the development of the private, family farming sector&#13;
within a market economy. To this end, Government has: removed limits on agriculture land ownership;&#13;
enacted legislation for the sale or lease of state-owned land and supported the development of institutions&#13;
to implement this policy; legislated the sale of former socially-owned enterprises; ceased the use of&#13;
subsidized credit through the National Bank of Croatia - which previously represented 80% of direct State&#13;
transfers to agriculture; reduced budget expenditures to the sector to some 3 % of government&#13;
expenditures; and reduced the use of quotas to control foreign trade. The commitment to the private,&#13;
family farm sector is reflected in Government's "Agricultural Policy Strategy" which was approved by&#13;
Parliament in March 1995. The Farmer Support Services Project (FSSP) would be fully compatible with&#13;
and support the implementation of Government's "Agriculture Policy Strategy".&#13;
B. BANK'S COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
1.4   Private sector development is the focal point of the Bank's assistance to Croatia, and is a key&#13;
element in the development of the agriculture sector. The proposed project would support the reform&#13;
agenda outlined in the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy, discussed on April 20, 1995, by fostering&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
private sector led growth in agriculture. The project would help Government establish essential public&#13;
and private services to support the development of a private, mostly family-based agriculture sector.&#13;
Other relevant issues, such privatization of former social sector farms and state-owned land, and trade&#13;
and price policies are being handled under a proposed Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan operation,&#13;
currently under preparation. A proposed Rural Finance Pilot Project would support rural investments by&#13;
facilitating farmers' links with the national financial network. The project is, therefore, one important&#13;
element of a broader assistance strategy to the agriculture sector in Croatia, the combined effect of which&#13;
would lead the way to a market-based, largely privately owned and operated agriculture sector in&#13;
Croatia's reformed economy.&#13;
C. RATiONALE FOR WORLD BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.5    This relatively modest project offers the opportunity to assist government in redefining its role&#13;
in the agricultural sector, in developing policy analysis capacity, and in laying the foundation, through&#13;
a range of limited programs, for the development of a mix of private and public agricultural support&#13;
services which are accountable and responsive to the needs of the private fanner. With the break-up and&#13;
privatization of large social sector farms and agro-processing units, traditional sources of support services&#13;
for private farmers, such as provision of farm advice, extension services, and applied agriculture research&#13;
are disappearing. Other services such as veterinary services, seed regulations, agriculture policies and&#13;
statistics are in need of restructuring. The project would help fill this gap by supporting, through&#13;
contracting out to the private sector wherever feasible, more efficient extension services, agricultural&#13;
research and other services essential to the development of a modem, private agriculture sector.&#13;
1.6   Investment in support of private agriculture production is also shown to be indicated on economic,&#13;
social and technical grounds. Growth in agriculture is crucial to support economic growth, and well&#13;
within the realm of technical feasibility. Much of the known technology could be applied or easily adapted&#13;
to meet private farmer needs. The project would also contribute to improving living standards in rural&#13;
areas in which small-scale agriculture is a major employer and source of income.&#13;

CHAPTER II. THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR&#13;
A. AGRICULTURE IN THE ECONOMY&#13;
2.1    Agriculture is an important sector of the Croatian economy. The share of primary agriculture&#13;
(including fisheries) in GDP increased from 10.0 percent in 1990 to 14.6 percent in 1992, mainly as a&#13;
result of the fall in industrial production. With food processing included, the sectors share amounts to&#13;
some 24 percent of GDP. The agriculture sector (including fisheries and food processing) employs some&#13;
15 percent of the active population. Some 41 percent of Croatia's population lives in rural areas.&#13;
2.2    Exports of agricultural and fisheries products have increased, both in absolute and relative terms.&#13;
Between 1991 and 1994 agriculture exports increased by some 44 percent from roughly US$340 million&#13;
to roughly US$490 million. As a share of the country's exports, it increased from some 9 percent to 12&#13;
percent during the same period. Imports during the same period fell from around US$560 million in 1991&#13;
to US$440 million in 1994, while the share of agriculture commodities and processed food in the&#13;
country's total imports remained stable around 11 percent. Hence, in 1994 the agricultural sector had a&#13;
modest trade surplus.&#13;
2.3    Levels of employment in agriculture have been more resilient than other sectors in the economy.&#13;
From 1990 to 1993, employment in agriculture fell by 25 percent, compared with a fall of 50 percent&#13;
for the rest of the economy. This is associated with the fall in GDP and the absence of employment in&#13;
other branches of the economy. Agriculture has, therefore, been able to provide a buffer during a difficult&#13;
economic and social adjustment period.&#13;
2.4    Agriculture is likely to play an increasingly supportive role in the development of tourism, in&#13;
terms of supplying the increased demand for agricultural products (especially for fruits and vegetables&#13;
in the vicinity of the Adriatic coast), and services in terms of specialized forms of tourism such as&#13;
farmhouse tourism or hunting and fishing.&#13;
B. NATURAL RESOURCE BASE&#13;
2.5    Croatia covers an area of about 56,750 km2 or 5,675,000 ha, of which 3,230,000 ha are&#13;
agriculture land and 2,030,000 ha is arable land. Croatia has 2,028 km of land boundaries with other&#13;
states. It is bounded to the west by the Adriatic Sea, to the northwest by Slovenia, to the northeast by&#13;
Hungary, to the east by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and to the south by Bosnia-Herzegovina.&#13;
There are three main physiographic regions in the country: the Adriatic region to the west (32 percent&#13;
of Croatian territory); the mountainous region in the center (12 percent); and the Pannonian region in the&#13;
east (56 percent).&#13;
2.6   The coastal area, its hinterland and islands have a Mediterranean climate with mild wet winters&#13;
and warm dry summers although some rain does fall in every month of the year. In the central mountain&#13;
region the climate is affected to some extent by the altitude but otherwise this region is ameliorated by&#13;
the Mediterranean climate of the coast and the continental type climate farther east. Eastern Croatia, or&#13;
the Pannonian region has a continental climate with cold winters and hot summers although here again&#13;
there is some rain in the sunmmer period, often falling in the form of thunderstorms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
2.7    Croatia has some 1.2 million hectares of grassland of which 0.4 million ha are meadows' and&#13;
800,000 million ha are pastures. Grasslands thus occupy about 40 percent of all agricultural land but the&#13;
proportion of grass to arable varies greatly among regions and agroecological zones. Pasture yields are&#13;
very low and average less than 1.0 mt/ha. Low production can be attributed in part to the neglect of these&#13;
areas as a resource in favor of intensive systems of grain-based animal production by the former socialist&#13;
regime. Meadows and pasture land usually occupy poorer quality land.&#13;
C. THE SOCIAL SETTING&#13;
2.8    Croatia's population is estimated at 4.78 million. The 1990 household consumption survey&#13;
estimated a total of 1.35 million households, of which 96,724 were classified as purely farming&#13;
households and 404,355 were mixed households deriving part of their income from agriculture. Some 58&#13;
percent of the economically active farmers are 50 years of age or older.&#13;
2.9    Ex-social sector farms employ about 40,000 people, cultivates some 37 percent of all agriculture&#13;
land (1.2 million ha) of which 22 percent is arable land (430,000 ha), 20 percent of the total cattle and&#13;
30 percent of the national pig population. In most cases 50 percent of the assets of these agro-kombinats,&#13;
excluding land, has been transferred to employees and local civil servants, the remaining assets having&#13;
been transferred to the State. It is rare for privatization of agricultural firms to have proceeded further.&#13;
The State currently owns the lands of these farms and the land de-nationalization process, though&#13;
legislated, is stalled. The lands are used under temporary, informal rental arrangements, mostly by the&#13;
ex-social sector farms, often without payments being made to the State.&#13;
D. FARM STRucTuRE&#13;
2.10   Croatia's agriculture is marked by a dual farm structure, consisting of numerous small private&#13;
family farms on the one hand and some 500 large, vertically integrated agrokombinats (AKs) which have&#13;
dominated the sector during the socialist period. The average farm size of Croatia's roughly 500,000&#13;
private farms is 2.9 ha of arable land consisting of about eight usually non-contiguous plots. Moreover,&#13;
33% of these farms are under one hectare in area and only 2.6 percent are more than 10 ha, though,&#13;
more farmers operate enterprises in excess of 10 ha, usually through annual lease agreements.&#13;
2.11   Private farmers own about 63 percent of all agriculture land (2 million ha) and 78 percent (1.6&#13;
million ha) of arable land. The private fanrning structure essentially falls into two classes: some 400,000&#13;
part-time farmers and around 100,000 full-time farmers. First, the part-time farmers often operate on a&#13;
sub-subsistence unit of less than 3 ha and with a growing labor constraint due to age. These aged farmers&#13;
rent out land, but under the current land policy would not sell, as their land provides security. These&#13;
farms will gradually be absorbed by the progressive farmers who already form the production core of the&#13;
future. The rate of demise of these units will depend on what security and incentives Government policies&#13;
will provide to encourage land transfers.&#13;
2.12   Second, the professional full-time private farmers (some 100,000 households) who own from 3&#13;
to 10 ha and rent extra land on an annual basis. These farms are generally profitable and often have three&#13;
generations working. Despite the lack of technical and financial support, there is a confidence in the&#13;
future of private farming as a profitable venture and as an active export prospect. Mixed livestock/arable&#13;
1/  Meadows are natural or improved perennial pasture lands on cultivable soils, some of which have a history of fertilization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
farming predominates with farm sales mostly from grain, horticulture, and livestock products. Farms are&#13;
often over-mechanized but, with a rapid growth in contracting services, utilization of equipment is&#13;
improving. In the absence of land purchase possibilities and a mistrust of the banking system, tractors&#13;
are considered a safe placement of possible surplus funds. A recent survey based on progressive full-time&#13;
farmers showed that about 60 percent of full-time farmers own between 5 and 20 ha and 34% had&#13;
holdings of less than 5 ha, being mostly in the Mediterranean intensive cropping area.&#13;
2.13   The 500 agro-kombinats (AK), often vertically integrated enterprises that not only farm but also&#13;
own processing and marketing industries (as well as in addition some 86 agriculture cooperatives)&#13;
dominated the agriculture sector during the socialist regime. The AKs were the main source of food&#13;
production and received virtually all financial assistance to the agriculture sector to support maximization&#13;
of production with little consideration of costs involved. The AKs held the most productive land but,&#13;
through inappropriate methods of production, particularly cultivation practices, degradation of the soils&#13;
has taken place and yields have been declining. In a market economy, and with progressive withdrawal&#13;
of Government finance, the AK system has come under severe financial and operational pressures and&#13;
now presents a formidable problem as to what procedures should be instituted to return the land and other&#13;
assets to profitable farming systems. The AKs were also set up as a product procurement, storage and&#13;
processing bases.&#13;
E. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION&#13;
2.14   Land use is marked by the following features: the predominance of both agricultural land and,&#13;
particularly, arable land in the private sector; the extensive areas of meadows and pasture with ownership&#13;
of the latter dominated by the ex-social sector; private sector predominance in the viticulture and&#13;
horticulture industries; and, the relative importance of cereal and industrial crop (oilseed, sugar beet) as&#13;
opposed to fodder production for a predominantly continental climate.&#13;
2.15   Maize is by far the dominant crop in terms of area, followed by wheat which is the second most&#13;
important crop. Barley ranks a poor third among the cereals and there are smaller areas of rye and other&#13;
cereals. Potatoes predominate amongst the non-cereal crops, averaging 60,000-80,000 ha per year and&#13;
are followed in importance in terms of area by sugar beet, soybeans and sunflower. Orchards occupy&#13;
about 70,000 ha while vineyards cover almost 75,000 ha. Fodder crops are grown on about 172,000 ha&#13;
and there are just over 400,000 ha of meadows. Crop yields in the ex-social sector often surpassed those&#13;
of the private sector. Better access to credit and hence inputs favored social production, but the social&#13;
sector orientation of maximizing production rather than profit was an important contributory factor. This&#13;
is best demonstrated by comparing wheat yields, a crop sold mostly to the State, where ex-social sector&#13;
farms yielded as much as 70 percent higher than private farms. The latter's maize, however, typically&#13;
used for feeding livestock on-farm, out yields the former by more than 50 percent.&#13;
2.16   Livestock numbers decreased between 1961 and 1990. The population decrease has generally been&#13;
accompanied by a progressive improvement in productivity per head in most sectors. Predominantly&#13;
privately owned, 1989 data on herd and flock size in the private sector show about half of private farmers&#13;
owned cattle but only about 4 percent had more than five cows, 52 percent kept pigs with only roughly&#13;
5 percent having five or more sows, and eight percent kept sheep with about 3 percent owning more than&#13;
20 head. By far the largest numbers of cattle, pigs and sheep are kept on average size farms of about 3&#13;
ha, but an increasing number of more commercially viable livestock farming units are emerging in the&#13;
private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
F. SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES&#13;
2.17   Due to the legacy of the past regime, the development of the agriculture sector is presently&#13;
hampered by major constraints which Government is currently striving to address. These include: (1)&#13;
changes in agriculture structures in terms of privatization of agro-kombinats and agro-processing&#13;
companies, and in terms of land policy and privatization of agriculture land; (2) rural finance; (3) price&#13;
and trade policy reform; and (4) farm support services.&#13;
2.18   Structural changes to be introduced in the sector include (i) the further privatization of the now&#13;
semi-public assets owned by the agro-kombinats, (ii) the privatization of land (some 37 percent of the&#13;
total agriculture land) of these ex-social sector farms which is presently Government owned and is&#13;
currently farmed under short-term lease arrangements, either by the agro-kombinats or by private&#13;
farmers; (iii) the privatization of the remaining publicly owned agro-processing entities; and (iv) the&#13;
development of a land policy which would include the modernization of the cadastre system. The majority&#13;
of land (some 63 percent) is, however, under private ownership allowing private farmers to produce and&#13;
to provide a supply response to the services introduced under the project; the issue of land privatization&#13;
relates to the 37 percent of the agriculture land under state ownership and agrokombinat management that&#13;
would be addressed through a possible agriculture adjustment operation.&#13;
2.19   Further changes in the sector would also lead to increased competition in commodity and factor&#13;
markets. Government is considering an Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL) with assistance of&#13;
the Bank in order to address the privatization question of agro-kombinats and agro-processors as well as&#13;
land related issues. Marketing, however, is not a major constraint to the success of the proposed project,&#13;
because (i) most farmers at present manage to dispose of their production, even though marketing&#13;
channels are not very sophisticated in Croatia, and (ii) agriculture inputs are generally available to&#13;
farmers by a fairly broad range of input suppliers. Nevertheless, the project would assist in introducing&#13;
market transparency and competition through a limited market information system monitoring sales at&#13;
selected central points. Given the sometimes disappointing track record in the public support to&#13;
marketing development it is not suggested to add such further activities to the agenda of the FSSP. In&#13;
order to increase marketing infrastructure in the country MAF is currently discussing with the European&#13;
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) the possibility of financing wholesale markets in the&#13;
vicinity of Zagreb and other major towns in Croatia.&#13;
2.20 Rural Finance. Government perceives the lack of access to rural finance services as a major&#13;
obstacle to significant renewed investment in the sector, and is concerned that this problem could&#13;
ultimately constrain private farm productivity. MAF has requested the Bank to support a Line of Credit&#13;
(LoC) to be channeled through selected commercial banks on a pilot basis in order to test effective&#13;
demand and to overcome market failures associated with formal bank lending to the emerging private&#13;
farm sector. The Bank is considering such a LoC under a separate Rural Finance Pilot Project. In&#13;
general, however, farmers have reasonable scope to improve their operations, and introduce efficiency&#13;
gains (e.g. fertilizer and animal feeding regime, crop and farm management) without the need for&#13;
incremental external finance through farmers own internal cash generations and retained earnings as&#13;
observed during numerous farm visits and consistently shown by farm models. Further development,&#13;
however, should be supported through the provision of long-term financing of on-farm investments as&#13;
envisaged under a possible Rural Finance Pilot Project.&#13;
2.21   Trade and Price Regime. The overall incentive structure has improved markedly over the past&#13;
years and is likely to continue to evolve in the direction of border pricing indicating the true opportunity&#13;
costs of resources to producers. Nevertheless, some issues persist in the field of pricing policies (e.g.,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
some import quotas, and some floor prices). During the last years of the Yugoslav Federation the policy&#13;
environment was characterized by price policies with far-reaching intervention on both the production and&#13;
the consumption side, a trade regime based almost exclusively on import and export quotas, and a subsidy&#13;
policy pursuing cheap finance through broad interest rate subsidies. The highly distorted incentive&#13;
framework of the past was almost exclusively geared towards the support of social enterprises and agro-&#13;
kombinats.&#13;
2.22   In recent years Croatia's agriculture incentive environment has undergone important change&#13;
towards a more market-based incentive system. Consumer prices have been completely liberalized. Import&#13;
quotas on many products have been removed and replaced with tariffs. The application for membership&#13;
in the GATT / WTO, which has been recently submitted, will spur these changes. On the macro side,&#13;
rampant inflation has been brought to a halt through tight monetary and fiscal policies. Independence&#13;
and the war have led to a dramatic cut in the agricultural budget, from roughly DM360 million in 1990&#13;
to about DM140 million in 1994 which corresponds to a share of 2.6 percent of total government&#13;
expenditures compared to 15.0 percent in 1990. Substantial changes have also occurred in the allocation&#13;
of this budget. A huge interest rate subsidy was the dominant form of direct farm support during 1991 -&#13;
1993 (on average DM150 million annually or 80 percent of the budget). These interest rate subsidies&#13;
were discontinued at the end of 1993.&#13;
2.23   Croatia's agriculture policy has moved steadily towards the model of more liberalized economies&#13;
since the 1980s. Price support to most farm commodities is modest, and much lower than equivalent&#13;
levels of support in the EU, with the exception of sugar. Part of this support comes directly from modest&#13;
allocations of public funds, while most is provided implicitly through the trade regime. The range of&#13;
commodities supported has been considerably reduced over the years, and now includes only those&#13;
considered by Government to be strategically important, such as sugar, wheat, maize and milk. Prices&#13;
for commodities such as fruit, vegetables, meat and other dairy products are determined by market forces.&#13;
Some quotas, though significantly reduced over the past years, remain on sugar, wheat, seed and fertilizer&#13;
imports, in particular. Changes of trade and price policies would involve a revision of the operations of&#13;
the State Directorate for Commodity Reserves.&#13;
2.24   Table 1 below shows nominal protection coefficients for selected agricultural commodities.&#13;
Current price and trade policies result in low protection for oilseeds and pork, moderate protection for&#13;
cereals and milk and very high trade protection for sugarbeets. Beef, on the contrary, is not protected.&#13;
Moderate levels of support for farmers have been retained; most of the support directed to agriculture&#13;
accrues, however, to agricultural industries rather than farmers. Private farming historically has been&#13;
and continues to be associated with the commodities for which the least protection was granted and the&#13;
least price distortions introduced (i.e., horticulture, and animal production, in particular, meat, and to&#13;
a lesser extent, milk for which protection is moderate). The social farm sector has typically specialized&#13;
in wheat and maize grain production, and in sugar. While the level of protection associated with maize&#13;
grain has been moderately high, most maize produced by private farmers is not marketed but fed on-farm&#13;
to cattle and pigs (i.e., products without important price distortions). Price policies for wheat, which is&#13;
also grown by private farmers, is presently driven by strategic considerations, and likely to change to a&#13;
more rational policy, once hostilities cease in the region.&#13;

2.25   With the exception of sugar, the incentive framework is, therefore, sufficiently undistorted to&#13;
allow research and extension services to provide farming advice without leading to resource&#13;
misallocations. Financial and economic models of indicative farms, representing major agriculture&#13;
production areas and farm systems, further support this view (Annex E and M). It is anticipated that&#13;
under the planned ASAL further alignment of domestic input and commodity prices with border price&#13;
levels would be supported.&#13;
2.26   Support services to agriculture have, in the past, been geared to the agro-kombinats and farm&#13;
cooperatives. No support services have been directly available to the private farming community in terms&#13;
of extension, applied research, or animal breeding services; veterinary services have, in the past, been&#13;
oriented towards social sector agriculture. The seed industry has been left without a regulatory framework&#13;
which would enhance private sector participation in seed multiplication and export; agriculture statistics&#13;
and the policy formulating capacities of MAF have not been developed under the former Yugoslavia. The&#13;
thrust of the FSSP is on improving these services in the short term.&#13;
2.27   Agriculture technology is generally inefficient when judged, not only by European standards, but&#13;
also by those of elite farmers within Croatia. Efficiency gains in production are available in fertilizer use,&#13;
land preparation, crop sowing, crop rotations, and animal feeding, provided the research/extension system&#13;
is enabled to respond to farmers' perceived needs.&#13;
2.28   Combined, these partly historic constraints continue to curtail the development of commercially&#13;
viable family farms in Croatia. In the short term, private agriculture could be substantially supported and&#13;
the framework for major structural reforms established through a process of institutional restructuring&#13;
leading to increased client accountability and ownership.&#13;

G. GOVERNMENT'S AGRIcuLTURE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY&#13;
2.29   Through it's "Agriculture Policy Strategy" approved by Parliament in March 1995, Government&#13;
has made a clear commitment to promote the development of private farming within the framework of&#13;
a market economy. The objective of Government's agriculture policy is to promote efficiency in&#13;
production and marketing, and ensure the competitiveness of the agriculture sector on world markets.&#13;
The aim is also to overcome the legacy of large scale kombinats by giving emphasis to the development&#13;
of private family farms. This would be achieved by further restructuring of the current system of direct&#13;
support to agriculture production from the budget; replacement of import quotas with tariffs; and&#13;
reduction of tariffs under GATT's developing country status. Policy actions would also include the&#13;
introduction of structural changes in land and asset ownership by the full privatization of former social&#13;
sector farms and land, and of publicly owned agroprocessing enterprises; improving rural financial&#13;
services on a sustainable basis using both commercial banks and public institutions; tariffication of&#13;
remaining import quotas and strictly limiting the commodities for which limited support will be provided;&#13;
development of farm support services; and social policies including the reconstruction of war damaged&#13;
areas and restructuring of the agriculture pension fund.&#13;
2.30   The provision of relevant support services to the private farming community is a key instrument&#13;
of MAF's strategy. The need to establish a relevant agriculture knowledge system which would explicitly&#13;
allow for participation of the local farming communities, and combine private and public sector elements&#13;
in the provision of extension services is clearly recognized. Improving the regulatory framework of the&#13;
seed industry, as well as the veterinary services in terms of epidemiological analysis and monitoring, has&#13;
also been stressed by MAF as being an important public service. MAF also recognizes the potential of&#13;
the country's grassland resources which so far have been under utilized. Policy decision-makers are,&#13;
furthermore, aware of the need to improve the empirical basis and analytical methods in formulating&#13;
policies. These support services are recognized to have many characteristics of public goods, hence&#13;
justifying the public provision of such services.&#13;

CHAPTER III. ISSUES IN AGRICULTURE SUPPORT SERVICES&#13;
A. AGRICULTURE EXTENSION AND APPLIED RESEARCH&#13;
3.1    Private farming enjoyed government support in the former Yugoslavia only to the extent that it&#13;
benefitted the social or cooperative agro-industrial subsectors. Agricultural technology development was&#13;
focused on large scale farming and production maximization, paying insufficient heed to profitability and&#13;
economic sustainability. While some private farmers adapted this technology to meet their needs, most&#13;
learned and applied technology which is now widely recognized as being inappropriate to a market&#13;
economy. Although a body of appropriate technology exists and more can be gleaned from the practices&#13;
of successful private farmers, there remains the need to restructure and reorient the agriculture knowledge&#13;
system, comprising agriculture extension and applied research. This includes redefining its present&#13;
mandate and structure, giving it a market focus, making it responsive and accountable to its clients and&#13;
financiers and ensuring its future financial sustainability. While public institutions and investment will&#13;
be required to initiate the process, the medium term objective will be the progressive transfer of&#13;
management and financial responsibility for agricultural knowledge services to the private agricultural&#13;
sector.&#13;
3.2   Improved technology would enable farmers to increase production efficiency, reduce costs,&#13;
increase yield, improve quality and diversify production. Both public and private benefit would ensue,&#13;
the latter already in evidence amongst a core group of elite farmers. Instruments to support technology&#13;
promotion are presently limited. The main sources of information available to farmers are a small but&#13;
competent rural press, ill-trained Zupanija-based2 advisors, some elements of the scientific community,&#13;
a recently privatized veterinary service and a small, under-resourced national extension service. These&#13;
poorly wedded extension elements generally lack market or farm management focus, are short on&#13;
appropriate technology and, in the public sector, are largely unaccountable to their farmer clients. A&#13;
stimulus is required which would engage the farmer in constraint analysis and technology development,&#13;
better employ the public and private extension resources to address identified needs, increase client&#13;
accountability, and ultimately, transfer responsibility for the delivery of technical advice to the private&#13;
sector. In a similar way, agriculture research lacks relevance and accountability to the farming&#13;
community.  All agriculture research is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Science and&#13;
Technology (MOST), and only modestly funded at a level equivalent to roughly 0.2 percent of agriculture&#13;
GDP. A detailed description of issues are provided in Annex H (Agriculture Extension) and Annex J&#13;
(Agriculture Research) of the Supplemental Volume. The project would strengthen the agriculture&#13;
knowledge system by developing public and private extension services and by restructuring applied&#13;
research management through a competitive grant based research system. Given the broadly public goods&#13;
nature of these services, no cost recovery is envisaged during project implementation.&#13;
B. ANIMAL PRODUCTION SUPPORT SERVICES&#13;
3.3    Livestock production in Croatia is mainly a private sector enterprise. Animal output provides 40&#13;
percent of agricultural GDP. Support services have historically been provided through the government&#13;
veterinary service, and public sector breeding enterprises which require reform in order to be relevant&#13;
in a private farming context. Clinical veterinary services have recently been privatized and some of the&#13;
public functions of disease surveillance and vaccination are now carried out under contract from MAF&#13;
by private veterinary stations; however, competition in the provision of veterinary services is still limited&#13;
through regional monopolies granted to the newly private veterinary stations. Insufficient epidemiological&#13;
2/ Zupanija is the Croatian word for district.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
disease control and monitoring has resulted in import bans to key markets in the EU. A new Law on&#13;
Veterinary Services is currently being drafted. The draft version of the new law on veterinary services&#13;
has been selectively reviewed and assurances were received that (i) the new veterinary law, when&#13;
promulgated, will remove constraints to competition in the provision of animal breeding and veterinary&#13;
services, in particular, that regional monopolies for veterinary services would be abolished, and that the&#13;
prices for clinical veterinary services were subject to a negotiation process between veterinarians and&#13;
farmers or their respective representatives; and (ii) animal semen importation is unconstrained outside of&#13;
normal quarantine requirements.&#13;
3.4    Livestock production has been largely based on housed animals fed mainly concentrates, in&#13;
production systems focused on maximum per animal production rather than on optimum profitability&#13;
within a sustainable system context. This grain-based feeding largely ignores the comparative advantage&#13;
Croatia has through its largely under-utilized grassland and pasture resources (some 1.2 million ha). The&#13;
project would improve animal health services, assist in the development of the grassland potential, and&#13;
introduce private sector breeding-related activities on a pilot scale. (See also Annex J, Animal Health&#13;
Support Services, and Annex K, Pasture and Forage Development, Supplemental Volume).&#13;
C. SEED INDUSTRY&#13;
3.5    The Croatian seed industry has considerable potential but is constrained by an inadequate&#13;
regulatory framework, particularly the lack of Plant Variety Rights (PVR) legislation, and deficiencies&#13;
in the present seed legislation. With no statutory authority to regulate the industry and a lack of&#13;
transparency in the testing process (including failure to enforce regulations) international suppliers are&#13;
deterred from entering the market. Importation quotas are a further constraint. This results in absence&#13;
of competition in the provision of plant genetic materials to the farming community, and foregone seed&#13;
export possibilities. The project would support the development of the regulatory and institutional&#13;
framework within which a private sector seed industry could operate efficiently. (See also Annex L, Seed&#13;
Industry Development, Supplemental Volume).&#13;
D. MARKET INFORMATION SYSTEM AND AGRICULTURE STATISTICS&#13;
3.6    Prior to independence, the collection of agricultural statistics was oriented towards production on&#13;
ex-social sector farms. The consequent lack of information on private farms has become a serious&#13;
constraint to policy analysis, especially following the adoption of a new Agricultural Policy Strategy&#13;
which emphasizes the role of family farms. It is difficult to respond effectively to the needs of Croatia's&#13;
small-scale family farms when so little is known about the constraints they face and the implications of&#13;
policy changes for their well-being. Collection and access to timely and relevant agriculture market and&#13;
price information is also deficient. The project would support the establishment of a modest market&#13;
information system, and of regular on-farm monitoring surveys.&#13;
E. POLICY FORMULATION CAPABILITIES&#13;
3.7    Adoption of the Agricultural Policy Strategy has paved the way for widespread policy reform over&#13;
the next 2-3 years. The MAF's capacity for policy analysis and policy formation is limited however, both&#13;
in available staff and skills. Given the upcoming GATT / WTO membership negotiations and the possible&#13;
discussions on EU Association Agreements, price and trade policy formulation capabilities are recognized&#13;
as being of the highest priority. The project would strengthen MAF's policy formulation capabilities.&#13;
(See also Annex M, The Policy Analysis Unit: Background and Scope of Work, Supplemental Volume).&#13;

CHAPTER IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND CONCEPT&#13;
4.1    The project would support the GOC's agricultural policy by efficiently providing technology-&#13;
related support services that are relevant to the private farmers. The aim is to improve the income of the&#13;
private farming community and increase its productivity and hence the competitiveness of the sector. The&#13;
project would address the need: (i) to change delivery mechanisms for the provision of technical services&#13;
to the private farming community and (ii) for institutional restructuring to meet the needs of a market&#13;
economy. It would allow public authorities to respond to the service needs of the private farming&#13;
community and to ensure that private agriculture and agribusiness irrevocably have a voice in the&#13;
formulation of agricultural services and support policies.&#13;
4.2    The activities pursued under the project aim to have a major impact on private farming in the&#13;
short term and to introduce significant institutional improvements in the medium term. Increased farmer&#13;
ownership and accountability of the agricultural knowledge system (i.e., extension and applied research)&#13;
are an essential element of project design. The provision of relevant and efficient veterinary services and&#13;
support for the shift from a grain-based animal production system to a lower cost pasture-based livestock&#13;
industry are other central objectives. Rationalizing the regulatory framework for the seed industry would&#13;
also be supported. The project would furthermore seek to strengthen MAF's policy formulation&#13;
capabilities and the agriculture data base in order to ensure more rational policy decisions in the future.&#13;
No support would be provided to the ex-social sector Agro-Kombinats under the project (with the&#13;
exception of the research divisions of the AKs who would be eligible to participate in the competitive&#13;
research grant system (see para 4.15)).&#13;
B. SUMMARY PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.3    The proposed project consists of six components: (i) Extension, (ii) Research, (iii) Animal Health,&#13;
(iv) Pasture and Fodder Development, (v) Seed Industry Development, and (vi) Policy Analysis Support.&#13;
4.4    The project would:&#13;
(i)  modernize agriculture practices and farm management through extension and applied&#13;
research ensuring farmers' participation in these services. Extension would be supported&#13;
though the provision of public and private sector extension. The component would include&#13;
(a) a comprehensive training program and equipment to the existing county level extension&#13;
offices (which would be guided by farmer advisory councils) of MAF; (b) the formation&#13;
on a pilot scale of some 45 farmers associations who would hire private advisors on a cost&#13;
sharing basis with MAF; (c) the development of 25 extension training packages which&#13;
would be used for mass media based extension; (d) an on-farm trial and demonstration&#13;
program to be linked to the applied research supported under the project; and (e) the&#13;
introduction of farmer based milk recording on a pilot scale;&#13;
(ii)  improve applied agriculture research management through the establishment of an&#13;
Agriculture Research Council (ARC), with majority representation of the private farming&#13;
community. The ARC would define the applied agriculture research program and allocate&#13;
resources for research contracts through an Agriculture Research Fund (ARF) to be&#13;
established by the project (some US$5.2 million) on a competitive grant basis. The project&#13;
would establish four small zonal research-extension coordination units (ZRECU); and a&#13;
training program for researchers working on applied agriculture issues;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
(iii) strengthen public and private veterinary services. The National Veterinary Institute (NVI)&#13;
and its four regional branches would receive vehicles and a comprehensive range of&#13;
analytical equipment to intensify the national disease surveillance, complemented by&#13;
improved border quarantine posts. NVI national and regional animal health data bases&#13;
would be linked to MAF's epidemiological and disease reporting division which would&#13;
receive computer equipment and technical assistance. The managerial skills of private and&#13;
public veterinarians would be improved through training;&#13;
(iv) assist in the development of the country's underutilized grassland and pasture potential&#13;
(which represents some 40 percent of agriculture land). Measures would include: a&#13;
systematic evaluation of the national grassland resources; improvement of the laboratory&#13;
and training facilities of a pasture research station; local and overseas training; laboratory&#13;
and field experimental equipment for pasture trials and demonstrations; and  the&#13;
establishment of a modest seed bank;&#13;
(v) provide the regulatory framework for the seed industry. MAF would establish a National&#13;
Seed Authority (NSA), with legislated responsibility to regulate the seed and agro-chemical&#13;
markets, in which several institutions would be joined under one coordinated framework.&#13;
The NSA would be supplied with laboratory and field equipment for seed variety trials and&#13;
certification, plant pathology, and chemical registration; and NSA staff would also receive&#13;
overseas training; and&#13;
(vi)  improve MAF's policy analysis and formulation capabilities. Overseas training, long term&#13;
TA, selected policy studies, and computer equipment would be financed; and the&#13;
agriculture data base available to policy decision-makers would be strengthened through a&#13;
farm baseline survey, a farm monitoring program and a simple market information system.&#13;
C. DETAILED FEATURES&#13;
I. Agriculture Extension (US$7.2 million 3; see Annex A and H)&#13;
4.5    Public Extension. Under the project the existing public Zupanija (district) extension offices (21&#13;
offices with a total staff of 110) would develop into community supervised Zupaniia Extension Service&#13;
Centers (ZESC). These would provide the impetus to farmer group formation (see below) and act as a&#13;
source of information and specialized guidance to private advisers directly serving the farmers.&#13;
Relevance of the public extension services would be ensured through voluntary local Advisory&#13;
Committees representing the local farming community and agro-business which would allow for a flexible&#13;
reorientation of extension services in line with changing local priorities. All farmers, whether full-time&#13;
or part-time operators, would have the possibility to join and influence these advisory councils. Local&#13;
Advisory Committees are likely to provide substantial guidance to the public extension services given (i)&#13;
the active development and involvement of the recently established Croatian Farmers Association at the&#13;
district level; and (ii) the positive response this approach was given by individuals during farm visits, and&#13;
during an Extension Workshop bringing together farmers, extension workers and the research community&#13;
during project preparation. The establishment of local Advisory Committees may initially be on an ad-hoc&#13;
basis requiring some extension support until formal procedures have been established by the individual&#13;
Committees.&#13;
31 Cost estimates including physical and price contingencies and duties and taxes (see also Annex B).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
4.6   The project would develop the required skills, provide means of mass media communication, and&#13;
establish the necessary infrastructure for the 21 ZESCs and MAF's Extension Department to ensure&#13;
effective dissemination of relevant information to the private farming community. Through the project&#13;
the public extension services would be provided with 44 vehicles (two in each ZESC, two to MAF's&#13;
Extension Department), 21 sets of basic office infrastructure (including furniture, photocopier, and fax;&#13;
one set per ZESC), 67 computers (three in each ZESC and four at MAF's Extension Department), 23&#13;
sets of audio-visual equipment (one set per ZESC, two for MAF's Extension Department), and 21 kits&#13;
of extension field equipment (including a microscope, tape measures and scales, one kit per ZESC). Each&#13;
ZESC would also be provided with a basic reference library and annual subscriptions to farm production&#13;
journals.&#13;
4.7    Each ZESC would carry out a one-time, farm community based diagnostic survey in order to&#13;
develop a thorough understanding of the constraints and potential of the areas they are servicing, and to&#13;
give the extension services the opportunity to inform farmers in their area of the new extension approach.&#13;
The diagnostic survey exercise would help define the annual working program of the Zupanija extension&#13;
service.&#13;
4.8    The project would implement a substantial extension training program amounting to a total of&#13;
some 462 months, phased over project implementation, including: (i) a trainers of trainer program; (ii)&#13;
a one-time general orientation course for each extension staff; (iii) regular and (iv) specialized in-service&#13;
training. In addition, study tours and post-graduate fellowships would be carried out by selected extension&#13;
experts to get a better understanding of extension issues and operations in other countries. This training&#13;
program would enable staff of the extension service to acquire the skills necessary to operate under a&#13;
changed mandate. Subjects would include farm business management, financial and marketing skills,&#13;
group formation skills, environmental awareness, preparation of mass media and training packages, and&#13;
information management. The training of trainer program would be carried out prior to project start-up&#13;
financed through a Japanese Grant.&#13;
4.9   The project would provide for the development of some 25 thematic trainin,e packa,es for the&#13;
ZESCs and other advisers for incorporation within an extension program for farmers. The training&#13;
packages would also form the basis of mass media activities which would be developed on a contractual&#13;
basis involving the extension, research and broadcasting (radio and television) services. Topics would&#13;
include farm business management, improving marketing arrangements of primary producers, and&#13;
technical items such as crop and integrated pest management. The project would also develop a Farm&#13;
Management Handbook for farmers which would include, inter alia, agriculture price schedules, and farm&#13;
enterprise budgets across agriculture zones.&#13;
4.10   The project would also support an on-farm trial and demonstration program consisting of some&#13;
2,200 field demonstrations over the life of the project which would be carried out through the ZESCs in&#13;
coordination with agriculture researchers pursuing competitive grant-based applied research also supported&#13;
through the project (see agriculture research component, below).&#13;
4.11   Private Extension. The project would develop private advisorv services which currently are&#13;
practically non-existent in Croatia outside of the agrokombinats. Under the project, the formation of a&#13;
limited number of farmer associations (some 45 associations, roughly 2 associations in each Zupanija)&#13;
on a pilot basis would be supported in view of farmer associations employing private advisors in&#13;
agricultural production, farm business management; and marketing associations management on a&#13;
matching grant basis. Each association would directly employ its own adviser who would be funded by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
MAF during the first four years on a cost sharing-basis 4 and receive some basic training equipment, also&#13;
on a grant basis. The public extension service would develop standard contracts and provide the newly&#13;
established fanner associations with legal advice during the process of hiring private advisors. Private&#13;
advisors working under the farmer association pilot scheme would also participate in the above extension&#13;
training program. In order to ensure (i) accountability and (ii) the interests of farmers, MAF has provided&#13;
the Bank with draft regulations, satisfactory to the Bank, for allocating grants and for supervising and&#13;
auditing the public funds under the farmer association pilot scheme. Some ten associations eligible for&#13;
support have so far been established in different zupanija, and it is anticipated that most of the&#13;
associations would be established during the first two years of project implementation. This pilot scheme&#13;
(as well as the pilot scheme described in para. 4.12) would be phased over the four years of project&#13;
implementation. Existing farm associations have expressed strong interest in a phased cost sharing&#13;
arrangements in view of hiring private advisors.&#13;
4.12   Also on a pilot basis, fanner herd recording groups (some 45 in three Zupanijas) would be&#13;
supported through the Croatian Livestock Selection Center (CLSC) in close collaboration with the ZESC&#13;
to promote farmer-based milk recording. Milk recording data, an important management tool in milk and&#13;
animal production would be used by the extension service and the farmer herd recording group. Farmer-&#13;
based milk recording would also be a first step in supporting private animal breeding efforts and in&#13;
reducing the high costs of recording animal performance presently carried out fully by the public sector.&#13;
Project support would include the establishment of small recording groups, the provision of milk&#13;
recording and testing equipment, limited number of computers for data processing at the Zupanija level,&#13;
and industry staff training including a study tour to selected European animal breeding programs.&#13;
4.13   Over the course of project implementation, the extension component would be supported through&#13;
international and national technical assistance amounting to 23 person months of assistance (extension&#13;
specialists, training specialists, herd recording advisors). The project would also support incremental&#13;
recurrent costs including operation and maintenance of ZESCs and MAF's Extension Department offices&#13;
and vehicles. No incremental public extension staff would be hired under the project.&#13;
4.14   In order to ensure sustainability of agriculture production and the safe use and handling of agro-&#13;
chemicals, MAF would develop environmental ('best practice') guidelines for the extension services in&#13;
line with applicable environmental legislation as agreed under a dated covenant to the Loan Agreement&#13;
no later than April 30, 1997 (see para. 7.1).&#13;
II. Agriculture Research (US$8.0 million; see Annex A and I)&#13;
4.15   The project would support an applied agriculture research management system to produce relevant&#13;
and timely information for the private family farmers through research contracts on the basis of&#13;
competitive research grants. Under the project an independent Agriculture Research Council (ARC) with&#13;
a majority of farmer representation, and a small secretariat would be established for defining policy, and&#13;
allocating resources under an Agriculture Research Fund for applied research contracts on a competitive&#13;
grant basis. In order to ensure that a clear understanding on the concept and principles for the applied&#13;
research component under the project has been reached, MAF has provided the Bank with a&#13;
Memorandum of Understanding, satisfactory to the Bank, signed by the respective Ministers of&#13;
Agriculture and Forestry, and Science and Technology, which outlines the responsibilities of the&#13;
respective Ministries and of the future ARC for the implementation of the Agriculture Research&#13;
component. The research agenda would be (i) open-ended and determined by the ARC, and (ii) would&#13;
4/Based on the following formula for private advisor's salary support: 80 percent in year 1, 50 percent in year 2, 35 percent in year&#13;
3, and 25 percent in year 4. No support would be provided thereafter. The balance would be provided by the farmer group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
allow for a broad scope of topics to be researched ranging from production technology to market research&#13;
and development. Any bona fide Croatian research institution, public or private, would be eligible to&#13;
participate under the competitive research grant system and make research proposals in the framework&#13;
of publicly announced Terms of Reference by the ARC in view of obtaining research contracts supported&#13;
under the project. The ARC secretariat, consisting of one high caliber professional staff and an&#13;
administrative assistant, would be provided with a set of office and computer equipment, and a vehicle.&#13;
The ARC secretariat would also be equipped with a computer network allowing it to link with MAF and&#13;
MOST and the academic networks in the country.&#13;
4.16   The ARC would administer an Agriculture Research Fund (ARF) established under the project&#13;
providing roughly US$1.3 million during each year of project implementation (i.e., a total of US$5.2&#13;
million over four years) to finance applied research contracts on a competitive grant basis. During&#13;
project implementation this fund would be financed to a large extent through the World Bank loan&#13;
(roughly estimated at around 80 percent) with the balance from budget allocations (roughly 20 percent).&#13;
Project funding would increase overall allocations to agriculture research to the equivalent of roughly 0.35&#13;
percent of agriculture GDP. In order to ensure that both regional and national research priorities are being&#13;
addressed a funding formula would be agreed upon by the ARC prior to project implementation, and&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, for a period not shorter than three years, which would allocate funds to the main&#13;
agriculture regions (based, for instance, on the relative contribution to agriculture GDP) and to overall&#13;
national research. In order to ensure financial sustainability of the Agriculture Research Fund, MAF is&#13;
committed to introducing in the course of project implementation modest commodity based levies to be&#13;
paid by the producer, once the overall concept has gained credibility within the farming community. This&#13;
credibility is largely a function of the relevance and quality of the applied research and the associated&#13;
independence of the ARC. The project would provide for technical assistance to review the funding of&#13;
the Agriculture Research Fund and make recommendations for the possible introduction of commodity&#13;
based levies after project mid-term review.&#13;
4.17   Under the project a substantial research management training program amounting to some 168&#13;
months of training for applied research staff and the ARC (and its secretariat) would be carried out. This&#13;
training program would include a visiting scientist program, research staff orientation courses, research&#13;
management training, research management study tours for ARC members, and research reporting&#13;
seminars. Training would be provided in particular for researchers who have obtained research contracts&#13;
from the ARC. Computer networking of the Agriculture Faculty, University of Zagreb, with international&#13;
agriculture data bases would be provided, as would be subscriptions to journals and books.&#13;
4.18   Four Zonal Research Extension Coordination Units (ZRECU) would be phased in during project&#13;
implementation as the ARC becomes operational and each ZRECU would be provided with office and&#13;
computer equipment; each ZRECU would have incremental staff consisting of one economist and one&#13;
research/extension specialist. The ZRECUs would (i) serve as backstopping service to the district&#13;
extension services by providing specialized advice, (ii) would create a formal link between research,&#13;
extension and the farming community and (iii) would be current on research results and provide guidance&#13;
to the ARC.&#13;
4.19   Prior to project start-up, technical assistance would be provided under a Japanese Grant fund to&#13;
develop operational procedures for the ARC and the ARF, as would the procedures for the scientific&#13;
screening and review of research proposals, contract administration, and supervision to be carried out by&#13;
MOST. Short-term technical assistance (12 months) would be provided over the life of the project&#13;
including research management consultancy and training, and expertise on specialized research topics.&#13;
4.20   The project would also support the incremental recurrent costs associated with the research&#13;
component including: honoraria and travel allowance of the ARC chairperson and members, salaries and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
travel allowance of the secretariat and ZRECU staff; operation and maintenance costs for the secretariat's&#13;
and the ZRECU's office (including office rents) and vehicles. The institutional requirements to operate&#13;
this component are relatively modest, i.e., the ARC which meets some 4 - 5 times a year, a two person&#13;
secretariat, the support of the MOST (without incremental staff), and four small ZRECU. The latter&#13;
would be phased in during project implementation comprising two professional staff each.&#13;
4.21   In order to ensure financial sustainability of the Agriculture Research Fund, it has been agreed&#13;
under a dated covenant, that a review of the funding arrangements for the Agriculture Research Fund&#13;
(including the possibility to introduce modest commodity based levies) would take place not later than&#13;
April 30, 1999 (see para 7.1). Also under a dated covenant it has been agreed that the first of the four&#13;
ZRECU would be established by MAF not later than October 31, 1997; and that the three remaining&#13;
ZRECUs would be established at the latest by October 31, 1998 (see para 7.1). As a Condition of&#13;
Board Presentation, and in view of ensuring efficient implementation of this component through a&#13;
phased approach to establishing the new research management system, MAF has established the ARC,&#13;
including (a) the nomination of a chairperson and a core council (consisting of at least three farmer&#13;
representatives; a representative each of MAF and MOST; and one representative from the research&#13;
community); in addition, MAF has identified the secretary of the ARC to be appointed at the time of&#13;
declaration of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement (see para. 7.2). As a condition of disbursement for&#13;
the research component it has been agreed that MAF would (i) have worked-out jointly with MOST&#13;
and the ARC operational guidelines (including a funding formula) satisfactory to the Bank (this would&#13;
be supported through technical assistance fielded in September 1995 under a Japanese Grant Fund); and&#13;
(ii) MAF would have established the full ARC council (see para. 7.3).&#13;
III. Animal Health Support Services (US$6.1 million, see Annex A and J)&#13;
4.22   Animal health would be improved through the strengthening of epidemiological services leading&#13;
to better disease identification and eradication programs. The National Veterinary Institute (NVI) and its&#13;
four regional branches would be provided with eight vehicles, and a comprehensive range of laboratory&#13;
equipment to intensify the national disease surveillance program (US$2.9 million), a process which would&#13;
be complemented by strengthened border quarantine posts. NVI national and regional animal health data&#13;
bases would be linked to MAF's epidemiological service, and MAF's national disease reporting service&#13;
strengthened through the provision of computing equipment to support national disease eradication, and&#13;
international disease reporting requirements. The technical and managerial skills of private and public&#13;
veterinarian would be improved through local and overseas training (178 months). The National&#13;
Veterinary Chamber would be strengthened. International specialists would support the epidemiological&#13;
services, data management and veterinarian training programs (10 months). The project would support&#13;
the incremental recurrent cost of disease monitoring and control in terms of salary (two incremental staff&#13;
to MAF's epidemiological service), vehicle, and laboratory operations.&#13;
4.23   The new regulatory framework (see para. 3.3) will have a major impact on the effectiveness of&#13;
the investments for animal health described above and on veterinary services and disease control in&#13;
general. Therefore, as Condition of Board Presentation, MAF has carried out a review of the draft&#13;
veterinary legislation ('Veterinary Law') through the International Organization of Epidemiology (Paris),&#13;
and has presented the draft law to Parliament (see para. 7.2). MAF has assured the Bank that the revised&#13;
draft to Parliament includes the abolishment of regional monopolies for veterinary services, and that the&#13;
law foresees prices for clinical services to be subject to a free negotiations process between farmers and&#13;
veterinarians or their respective professional representatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
IV. Pasture and Fodder Development (US$2.3 million, see Annex A and K)&#13;
4.24   The Grassland and Fodder Development component would initiate an evaluation of the national&#13;
grassland resources using recently completed national vegetation maps supported by field observations.&#13;
An international pasture/livestock economist would provide guidance to the pasture program during early&#13;
project implementation. Concurrently, laboratory and training facilities at the Slejme Pasture Research&#13;
Station of the University of Zagreb would be improved and expanded (detailed designs have already been&#13;
completed) and a comprehensive program of post-graduate and in-service training in pasture management&#13;
initiated (in particular for farmers and extension service staff). Laboratory and field experimental&#13;
equipment would be provided to support an adaptive natural and improved pasture trial and demonstration&#13;
program, supported by limited specialist technical assistance. Pasture trials and demonstrations would be&#13;
carried out in close collaboration with research institutions and extension services across the country.&#13;
Linkages to European pasture research networks would be improved. The program would also support&#13;
the University-based forage breeding program and establish a modest seed bank at the Agricultural&#13;
Faculty, Zagreb. These activities would support the shift from a grain-based to a pasture and fodder-based&#13;
animal feeding system. Once this component has been implemented under the project, grassland research&#13;
would compete for research funds from the ARC under the competitive grant research system.&#13;
V. Seed Industry Development (US$3.8 million; see Annex A and L)&#13;
4.25   Government is committed to bringing the seed industry into line with European norms. To this&#13;
effect, new seed legislation is drafted, and an application made to join the International Union for the&#13;
Protection of New Plant Varieties (UPOV). Investment in the completion of the regulatory framework&#13;
and establishment of a statutory seed industry regulatory body would accelerate this process, ensuring&#13;
better seeds for Croatian farmers and improved export opportunities for seeds. The project would provide&#13;
the intermational expertise and staff training required to establish and implement a seed industry regulatory&#13;
framework in line with European Union requirements. A National Seed Authority (NSA) would be&#13;
established with legislated responsibility to regulate the seed and agro-chemical markets and which would&#13;
amalgamate several institutions under one coordinated framework. The NSA would be responsible for&#13;
seed testing and certification, agro-chemical registration, and development of Integrated Pest&#13;
Management. Inspection of commercial seed multiplication would be carried out by private sector&#13;
inspectors under license from NSA. The NSA would incorporate the existing seed testing and border&#13;
quarantine services of MAF; the Plant Protection Institute, the Viticulture Institute and the services to be&#13;
established for seed testing of plant material under the project.&#13;
4.26   Project support to the NSA would include: laboratory and field equipment for variety trials, plant&#13;
pathology, seed and chemical testing; eight vehicles for field work and equipment transportation; in-&#13;
service training (50 months) for private seed certification inspectors; specialized overseas training in seed&#13;
testing and variety trials; 18 months of technical assistance; and incremental staff (about 25 professional&#13;
staff phased over the course of project implementation of which 11 would be at NSA headquarters and&#13;
7 at each of the two field trials sub-centers), office rental, and vehicle and equipment operating expenses.&#13;
4.27   The new seed legislation I will have a major impact on the future of the seed sector and the&#13;
impact of the NSA supported under the project. In order to ensure a meaningful use of the investments&#13;
supported under the project, it has been agreed that Croatia would (i) have enacted the new seed&#13;
legislation (the draft of which would have been reviewed by the Intermational Union for the Protection&#13;
of New Varieties of Plants (Geneva), and the Intermational Seed Testing Association (Zurich),&#13;
respectively, and comments included in the revised draft law presented to Parliament); (ii) MAF would&#13;
5/Consisting of the Law on Plant Variety Protection, and the Law on Plant Variety Approval.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
establish the National Seed Authority (NSA), (iii) appoint a director satisfactory to the Bank; and (iv)&#13;
obtain suitable locations for setting up core NSA infrastructure as a condition of disbursement for the&#13;
seed industry component (see para. 7.3). In order to ensure farmers' access to good plant genetic&#13;
material and competition in the subsector, it has been agreed that at the latest under a dated covenant,&#13;
at the latest by October 31, 1997 Government would convert all existing import quotas to tariffs (see para&#13;
7.1). In view of ensuring the financial viability of the NSA, preparation of a schedule on cost recovery&#13;
for the NSA by no later than six months after establishment of the NSA has been agreed upon under a&#13;
dated covenant (see para. 7.1).&#13;
VI. Policy Analysis Support (US$2.3 million, see Annex A and M)&#13;
4.28   The project would strengthen the policy formulation capacity of MAF's restructured Agriculture&#13;
Policy Analysis Unit (APAU) through: (i) staff overseas training (15 months); (ii) a long-term resident&#13;
and short-term international TA (24 months); (iii) funds to contract studies on pressing policy issues (a&#13;
total of 5 major studies; topics include: rural land markets; marketing development, sugar, oilseeds,&#13;
dairy, and fertilizer subsector studies) and (iv) computing and some office equipment and a vehicle. In&#13;
addition, the project would strengthen the empirical basis required for decision makers by establishing&#13;
a simple market information system and by carrying out under contract with the Institute of Agriculture&#13;
Economics, University of Zagreb, a baseline survey, and a farm monitoring survey program. The project&#13;
would also support recurrent costs associated with this component. These costs include: salaries for four&#13;
incremental professionals and support staff at the APAU, and ten part time market enumerators; travel&#13;
allowance and car mileage; and incremental operating costs of APAU including publishing of policy&#13;
reports, and market news communication.&#13;
4.29   The market information system would record prices and marketed quantities for key commodities&#13;
and inputs at some ten central locations throughout the country on a daily basis. The data would be&#13;
transmitted to MAF's APAU by fax/modem, analyzed and forwarded to a national radio station for&#13;
broadcasting on the same day.  A baseline survey would be carried out early during project&#13;
implementation by the Institute of Agriculture Economics, University of Zagreb (which would be&#13;
provided with software and computing equipment) to provide up-to-date information on factors such as&#13;
demographic characteristics, the farm resource base, cropping patterns and livestock holdings, levels of&#13;
production and marketed surplus, the level and composition of farm income and expenditure, and the&#13;
contribution of non-farm income to total household income. It would also include behavioral and&#13;
attitudinal variables. A second, smaller and on-going survey would then be initiated as the basis for an&#13;
annual monitoring of the status and the changes on family farms. This second survey will be of a size&#13;
(in terms of both numbers and data collected) which allows rapid data collection, processing and analysis.&#13;
4.30   Staff development is key to the success of this component. Therefore, under a dated covenant,&#13;
MAF would staff the Agriculture Policy Analysis Unit with four additional policy analysts at the latest&#13;
by October 31, 1996 (see para. 7.1). In view to assist the Agriculture Policy Analysis Unit during&#13;
implementation, the APAU would exchange views annually on its work program with the Bank (see&#13;
para. 7.1).&#13;
Project Implementation Unit (US$0.3 million)&#13;
4.31   A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has been established within MAF under the Department&#13;
of International Relations. The PIU would be responsible for overall project implementation and&#13;
coordination. This Department has already acquired substantial experience in procurement under the&#13;
agriculture component of the Bank-financed Emergency Reconstruction Project. MAF has assigned the&#13;
Deputy Ministers, International Relations, and Agriculture as the project manager and the deputy project&#13;
manager, respectively. MAF has also hired an implementation officer for the PIU who would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
responsible for the day-to-day management of the PIU on a full-time basis. The latter has received basic&#13;
training in World Bank procurement procedures. In addition, MAF would assign a full time procurement&#13;
staff, a financial officer, and an administrative assistant to the PIU. The PIU would receive two vehicles,&#13;
and office and computing equipment, and be supported by two months of technical assistance to carry&#13;
out the project mid-term review.&#13;
4.32  In order to ensure expedient project start-up, as a condition of Board Presentation, MAF has&#13;
appointed the procurement staff, and has identified a financial officer and an administrative assistant who&#13;
would be appointed on a full-time basis to the PIU upon Loan effectiveness (see para. 7.2). PIU staff&#13;
members would be provided training in procurement and disbursements through Bank-organized seminars&#13;
and workshops prior to project start-up using a Japanese Grant fund. In light of MAF's current&#13;
procurement experience and the appointment of procurement staff, MAF is judged to be capable of&#13;
undertaking procurement under this project.&#13;
D. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
4.33   Project Costs. The total project costs including contingencies are estimated at US$30.0 million&#13;
of which the foreign exchange component is estimated at US$17.0 million (56.6 percent). Project cost&#13;
summary is presented in Table 2 below. Detailed project costs are given in Annex B. Taxes and duties&#13;
amount to about 16 percent of total project costs (US$4.7 million). Incremental recurrent costs represent&#13;
some 25 percent of total project costs.&#13;
4.34   Project Financing. The World Bank would provide a loan amounting to US$17.0 million (i.e.,&#13;
the equivalent of the foreign exchange component). The World Bank loan would finance all direct and&#13;
indirect foreign exchange associated with project costs net of taxes and duties. The balance (including&#13;
taxes and duties) would be financed by GOC. Table 3 shows the sources of finance by component.&#13;
4.35  Incremental recurrent cost. All incremental recurrent costs associated with the project would be&#13;
funded from Government resources. Annual incremental recurrent costs after project implementation are&#13;
estimated to amount to approximately US$2.3 million equivalent.&#13;
4.36   Fiscal Impact. The fiscal impact on Government budget is estimated to amount to approximately&#13;
US$13.0 million equivalent over the project implementation period. The Ministry of Finance has&#13;
repeatedly stated that this project is considered to be of high priority and, as implementation would&#13;
commence in full only after the beginning of 1996, the budget would assure the necessary counterpart&#13;
funding in CY1996 and onwards. The Bank has been informed that MAF has submitted a budget proposal&#13;
for CY96 which requests an adequate level of counterpart funding. Table 4 below gives a breakdown of&#13;
the estimated annual fiscal contribution to the project over the calendar years of the implementation&#13;
period.&#13;
4.37  Japanese Grant. A Japanese Grant Agreement to fund project start-up activities in the amount of&#13;
US$535,000 has been signed by the Ministry of Finance on March 20, 1995.&#13;

4.43   Disbursements against contracts for goods and services exceeding US$300,000 equivalent would&#13;
be made against normal documentation. For contracts below that level, disbursements would be made on&#13;
the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) and would be kept available for examination by Bank&#13;
missions, with appropriate documentation retained by the PIU.&#13;
4.44   Special Account: To facilitate timely project implementation, the borrower would establish,&#13;
maintain and operate a Special Account, under condition acceptable to the Bank. During the early stage&#13;
of the project, the initial allocation of the Special Account would be limited to US$1.0 million. However,&#13;
when the aggregate disbursements under the Loan have reached the level of US$5.0 million, the initial&#13;
allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of US$1.5 million by submitting the relevant&#13;
Application for Withdrawal. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every three months,&#13;
and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents. These&#13;
authorized allocations have been finalized with the Borrower during Negotiations (see para. 7.1).&#13;
4.45   A Government Budget Account (GBA) for the project would be established as an identifiable&#13;
project line item under the regular budget of MAF which would be used (a) in full payment of all&#13;
recurrent costs associated with the project; (b) in payment of all taxes and duties associated with the&#13;
project; and (c) to replenish the Project Bank Account (see below). In addition, a Project Bank Account&#13;
(PBA) denominated in Kuna would be used in payment of local contracts (i.e. civil works, agriculture&#13;
research contracts, local consulting services and studies, training) financed jointly under the Bank's Loan&#13;
and from the Government budget in order to avoid separate payment of suppliers from two distinct&#13;
accounts. The PBA would be replenished on a quarterly basis (a) from the SA upon request of MAF&#13;
(PIU) and authorized by MOF; and (b) from the Government budget account for the project.&#13;
4.46  In order to ensure efficient project implementation, two Conditions of Disbursement for individual&#13;
components have been agreed upon for the following components: (1) Agriculture Research: (i) MAF&#13;
would have worked-out jointly with MOST and ARC operational guidelines (including a funding formula)&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank; and (ii) MAF would have established the full ARC Council (see para. 7.3); and&#13;
(2) Seed Industry Development: Croatia would have enacted the new seed legislation, and MAF would&#13;
have (a) established the National Seed Authority (NSA), (b) appointed a director satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
and (c) obtained suitable locations for setting-up core NSA infrastructure (see para. 7.3).&#13;

CHAPTER V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
5.1    The project would be implemented over a period of four years (mid-CY1996 to mid-CY2000)&#13;
after a period of intensive pre-project activities in CY95 and CY96 financed under a Japanese Grant.&#13;
Prior to project effectiveness major packages for procurement during the first year of implementation&#13;
would be compiled. In order to ensure that the PIU staff and others involved in project implementation&#13;
understand the implementation arrangements including procurement and disbursement requirements, the&#13;
Bank has organized a one-week project start-up seminar during January 1996. Given the legal reforms&#13;
introduced and the support of the envisaged TA under the projects, the institutions involved are judged&#13;
to capable of implementing the project components.&#13;
A. PROJECT COORDINATION ANI) MANAGEMENT&#13;
5.2    Overall Project Implementation. MAF  would take overall responsibility  for project&#13;
implementation. Detailed implementation arrangements prepared jointly with the Borrower are given in&#13;
Annex A of the PIP.&#13;
5.3    Extension. The Deputy Minister, Extension, would take responsibility for implementing the&#13;
agriculture extension program.&#13;
5.4    Research. The Deputy Minister, Agriculture, together with the project manager would coordinate&#13;
the establishment of the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) and provide guidance to the ARC during&#13;
project implementation. The ARC, responsible for the allocation of the national applied agriculture&#13;
research budget under the ARF through research contracts under a competitive selection system, would&#13;
be independent of the MAF in its operational and budgetary decisions but answerable to the Minister of&#13;
Agriculture and Forestry. MOST will be responsible for the general administration of applied research&#13;
contracts using procedures acceptable to the Bank; this would include inter alia screening research&#13;
proposals, and off-site and on-site supervision of research work.&#13;
5.5    Animal Health. The animal health program would be managed by the MAF's Veterinary&#13;
Department while diagnostic wok would be under the responsibility of the NVI.&#13;
5.6   Pasture and Fodder Development. The grassland program would be managed and implemented&#13;
by the Department of Grassland and Fodder Development, Agricultural Faculty, Zagreb University.&#13;
5.7   Seed Industry Development. MAF's Agriculture Department would establish the National Seed&#13;
Authority (NSA) which would subsequently administer the national seed industry quality control and&#13;
regulatory policy, as well as agro-chemical registration.&#13;
5.8   Policy Analysis Support. MAF's Policy Department would be responsible for restructuring its&#13;
Agriculture Policy Analysis Unit, hiring the required additional staff, contracting selected policy studies,&#13;
and for establishing the market information system. The one-time farm baseline survey and the annual&#13;
farm monitoring exercises would be carried out by the Institute of Agriculture Economics, University of&#13;
Zagreb.&#13;
5.9   Technical Assistance. The TA program envisaged for the project (some 75 months amounting&#13;
to some US$1.8 million) is essential for project success. In order to ensure timely recruitment of key&#13;
TA, it has been agreed that the extension specialists, the research management specialist, the veterinary&#13;
epidemiologist, the pasture/livestock economist, the seed certification specialist, and the long-term policy&#13;
specialist would be hired at the latest by October 31, 1996 under a dated covenant (see para. 7.1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
B. AccouNTs, AuDrrING AND REPORTING&#13;
5.10   Accounts. Separate and auditable project accounts would be established with the PIU in MAF and&#13;
project expenditures (irrespective of sources of funding) would be kept separate and identifiable. These&#13;
would comprise inter alia (i) a record of withdrawals on the Bank Loan with copies of all disbursement&#13;
requests and underlying documentation; (ii) a record of transactions on the Special Account and copies&#13;
of the bank statements on this Account; and (iii) project related expenditures incurred directly by MAF.&#13;
These records would be monitored on an up-to-date basis, and quarterly statements of transactions and&#13;
balances, together with updated procurement contract information, would be forwarded to the Bank.&#13;
5.11   Audits. Project accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors and under terns of&#13;
reference acceptable to the Bank. Sperate audited financial statements would be prepared for the SA, and&#13;
for the project accounts (including Statement of Expenditures). Separate financial records would be kept&#13;
and audited annually for the Agriculture Research Council, and the National Seed Authority, respectively.&#13;
All audit reports would be made available to the Bank at the latest four months after the end of the fiscal&#13;
year.&#13;
5.12   Reporting. MAF will prepare and furnish to the Bank, by December 1 of each year during the&#13;
disbursement period, forward looking technical and financial projections in a format acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, and review with the Bank the conclusions and recommendations of this projection, including the&#13;
proposed forthcoming annual budget for the Project and any measures that need to be taken during the&#13;
following year to ensure proper execution of the project. Assurances on these auditing and reporting&#13;
requirements have been obtained during negotiations (see para. 7.1 ).&#13;
5.13   A semestrial report on project progress and linked to the quarterly unaudited statements would&#13;
be submitted to the World Bank by the PIU and a comprehensive annual report would be compiled which&#13;
would include the results of monitoring activities based upon inter alia on the Project Performance&#13;
Indicators (see Annex D). A project completion report would be prepared by the PIU and MAF upon the&#13;
completion of the project.&#13;
C. MONITORING&#13;
5.14   Monitoring of the project's impact on the private farming community would be carried out&#13;
through a baseline survey in the first year of the project and through annual farm monitoring exercises&#13;
under taken by the Institute of Agriculture Economics (see para. 4.29). In addition, performance&#13;
indicators would be monitored by the PIU for each component. Project Performance Indicators jointly&#13;
developed with MAF are presented in Annex D of the PIP, and have been agreed upon during&#13;
negotiations (see para. 7.1).&#13;
D. BANK SUPERVISION&#13;
5.15   The project would be supervised by the Bank on average twice a year, however, one additional&#13;
start-up mission would be necessary, including a start-up workshop; the cost in that year is expected to&#13;
be 24 staff weeks (involving expertise in the field of extension, research management, seed testing and&#13;
certification) falling to 18 staff weeks in each of the subsequent years. A Mid-term Review would be&#13;
carried out at the latest by April 30, 1998 (see para. 7.1).&#13;

CHAPTER VI. PROJECT IMPACT&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
6.1    Private farmers will be the principal beneficiaries, deriving advantage from inproved production&#13;
technology and animal health services, and a strengthened regulatory framework for the seeds industry&#13;
and from government policies and services more conducive to the development of a vigorous private&#13;
agricultural sector. The project would contribute to improving living standards in rural areas in which&#13;
small-scale agriculture is a major employer and source of income. The project would also contribute to&#13;
increased productivity and production, as well as to an improved domestic food supply. Adaptive and&#13;
applied research would initially be focused on areas yielding quick returns, as part of a confidence&#13;
building process for the farming community and the extension and research services. Improved production&#13;
efficiency through better soil and crop management and crop rotations, and improved agro-chemical use&#13;
in the cropping sector; and improved returns from dairy and sheep production through better nutrition&#13;
and health care are likely early outcomes. Private farm advisors and public extension staff, trained in&#13;
financial and farm management principals, would assist farmers in making more rational investment&#13;
decisions. The investment will also generate substantial public benefits: disease control and livestock&#13;
product sanitary inspection will improve, and improved agricultural production and policy is likely to lead&#13;
to better resource utilization.&#13;
6.2   Improved Support Services. Farmers would have access to advisory services in which they have&#13;
ownership - the cost partly shared with Government - that are better able to respond, both quantitatively&#13;
and qualitatively, to needs and opportunities. Public extension and research staff would be more&#13;
accountable to farmers and adequately resourced, both materially and conceptually, to meet the demands&#13;
of the emerging commercial family farms. Staff motivation is also expected to improve.&#13;
6.3   Institutional Reforms. The process of resource transfer in the agricultural knowledge system from&#13;
wholly public to a partnership of farmers and agri-business will be initiated leading to a longer-term&#13;
possibility for public and private sector cooperation. The capacity to deliver timely, accurate market and&#13;
sectoral information will be improved.&#13;
Increased Farm Incomes (see Annex E)&#13;
6.4    Quantifying the incremental impact of the broad range of project activities which to a large extent&#13;
are of an institutional development nature is notoriously difficult, given the numerous non-service factors&#13;
influencing decision-making at the farm level. General research indicates that economic returns to&#13;
investments in agriculture research and extesnion as well as in other services can be very high. As an&#13;
approximation, indicative financial and economic farm models have been prepared to assess the likely&#13;
impact of project activities at the farm level. Farm models across the main agro-ecological zones of the&#13;
country and representing major production systems are presented in Annex E (and N of the Supplemental&#13;
Volume). The models are indicative and it is believed that they reflect changes which are likely to occur&#13;
on farms which are exposed to more focused extension services and have access to improved management&#13;
advice, seed, livestock and other inputs.&#13;
6.5    The crop and livestock budgets which form the basis of each farm/household model were&#13;
prepared in consultation with local agronomists and economists and checked by field discussion with&#13;
farmers, where possible. Generally they postulate crop yield increases of about 15 percent with project&#13;
and include higher fertilizer, better seed inputs and improved livestock rations. Farm size has been held&#13;
constant between without and with project situations, although there are changes in cropping patterns with&#13;
project. The investments to expand farm size, buy additional machinery or livestock or to install&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
irrigation, are excluded from these models as currently medium to short term credit is not available to&#13;
farmers. Model farm size is typically in the range of 5 to 7 ha (except for the intensive Dalmatia&#13;
Vegetable model). This is a little larger than average private farm size in these regions but there are many&#13;
such farms and it is considered that they are likely to respond first to improved support services. Labor&#13;
budgets show substantial annual surpluses of family labor in all models, without and with project.&#13;
Seasonal peaks in labor demand require use of hired labor in the intensive vegetable models and most&#13;
models do require incremental family labor with project. Household consumption of farm produce has&#13;
been included in each model and meets staple grain, milk, egg and meat needs in most cases (with the&#13;
exception of the high value vegetable model). Farm families will have to draw upon the cash surpluses&#13;
shown in each model to cover other food and living expenses. Overhead costs are also included in each&#13;
model to cover business expenses not readily allocated to individual crop or livestock enterprises. Such&#13;
costs are mostly in the range US$1,450 to US$1,800 per farm and cover electricity, other fuel, land tax&#13;
and insurance, tractor and equipment services and labor, not related to individual crop activities.&#13;
6.6    As very few private farms in Croatia have access to short or long term credit, the financing of&#13;
production inputs in these models follows reality as in both without and with project situations 100&#13;
percent of operating costs are financed by retained farm earnings from the previous year. Incremental&#13;
production costs typically lie in the range of US$715 to US$2,200 per farm, or a little under half of the&#13;
expected gross value of incremental revenue. This is within the capacity of most model farms to finance,&#13;
either from without project retained earnings, from off-farm income, or by moving to the with project&#13;
situation in steps phased over two or three years. Each model attempts to meet it's livestock feed needs&#13;
from on-farm forage and crop production, in line with usual practice in Croatia. The nature of much of&#13;
the new technology proposed is such (better seeds, additional fertilizer) that it is likely to be accepted&#13;
promptly when the benefits are demonstrated clearly.&#13;
6.7    Financial analysis of the five models (see Table 7) indicates that: (i) project activities are likely&#13;
to yield sufficient incremental financial benefit to farmers to encourage them to participate in or actively&#13;
use better extension, animal health services, seeds and market information (on average returns of 45&#13;
percent, ranging from 8 to 92 percent over the without project situation; (ii) in most of the models&#13;
farmers clearly have the ability to fund incremental short term inputs from internal cash generation, e.g.:&#13;
monthly milk payments or pig sales. In the Istrian model it may be necessary for farmers to fund the&#13;
added inputs from off-farm work in the tourist industry or by phasing changes suggested in the model&#13;
over several years; (iii) switching values (see Annex E and N) indicate that the models are robust,&#13;
requiring an increase of more than 100 percent in operating costs or a fall of more than 50 per cent in&#13;
incremental inflows to reduce NPV to zero at 10 percent discount rate; (iv) financial benefits may be&#13;
earned through changes in cropping pattern or livestock processing/marketing as well as increased&#13;
technical efficiency; (v) there is a substantial surplus of farm labor available on the modelled farms, and&#13;
labor returns per hour are maintained or increased under the with-project scenario for each model; (vi)&#13;
farmers have an ability to pay for useful services, especially where the scale of operation is large enough&#13;
to cover overheads and basic living costs or where high value vegetable, cheese or similar products are&#13;
involved.&#13;

a/ These models attempt to quantify the possible impact of improved extensions services and access to quality research and other technical services&#13;
supported under the project. Farm size has been held constant between without and with project situations, although there are changes in cropping&#13;
pattems with project.&#13;
b/ The with project cropping pattem expands higher return potato and luceme production and deletes wheat and maize production so as to avoid large&#13;
increments in labor or land use. Improved technology is applied to barley, potato and luceme production in the with project situation. Istria&#13;
traditionally provides hay and forage seeds to adjacent mountain areas and has adequate markets for increased potato production. Although livestock&#13;
activities comprise almost half of the gross value of production no incremental livestock income is assumed, as it focuses on higher value crops.&#13;
Family labor requirements increase from 1220 hours per year to 1410 hours with project, an increment of 190 hours. This still leaves a large surplus&#13;
which can be used in part to gain employment in the tourist industry.&#13;
c/ Dalmatia has a successful and expanding vegetable industry in part due to a warmer climate which enables early harvest and access to high price,&#13;
out-of-season markets in other parts of Croatia and nearby countries. No irrigation investment is included in this model. This model has a small farm&#13;
area of 1.2 ha but has by far the highest net value of production of any model due to the focus on early tomato and potato crops and other vegetables.&#13;
There are no changes of cropping pattem assumed for the with project situation but crop yields are increased by 10 per cent mainly in response to&#13;
higher fertilizer and manure inputs. Livestock are produced for home consumption and there are no increments with project. Incremental family labor&#13;
with project (to handle larger harvests) is 191 hour per year. Although there is substantial unused family labor, hired labor is needed to meet seasonal&#13;
peaks of demand and this also increases with project, by 33 hours per year.&#13;
d/ Lika is a mountainous area with much pasture land and some emphasis on livestock production. This model looks at changes in a mixed farm with&#13;
crop, cattle and pig production. The model increases potato and reduces wheat production with project in response to crop budget financial&#13;
profitability; additionally dairy cow numbers are increased from 3 to 4 and cheese making (600 kg per year) is introduced with project. There is a&#13;
strong demand for local cheeses and the necessary skills and interest in increasing production are available. Potato and barley yields are increased&#13;
by about 15 per cent with project in response to use of better seed and more fertilizer. The cropped area is constant at 5.8 ha in both project situations&#13;
and is below total farm area of 7.9 ha to allow for rotation and non-arable land. With project labor is only about half estimated available labor and&#13;
most of the increment is in high value cheese production yielding incremental hourly retums nearly double average without project retums.&#13;
e/ Slavonija is the major crop production region in Croatia. This model is representative of private farms which are replacing the Agro-Kombinats as&#13;
major producers in the region. The cropping pattem changes with project to reduce sugar beet and maize area and to expand soybean, so as to&#13;
improve farm self-sufficiency in pig feed. Wheat, meadow and barley are constant, as is the total cropped area of 5.3 ha. Almost half of the crops&#13;
produced (by value) are used on-farm for livestock production. The model includes I cow, 6 sows and a small poultry activity (no increment with&#13;
project). Of these, the pig activity is the main commercial livestock activity; with project weaner pig production increases by about 13 per cent and&#13;
ration costs are reduced. Crop yield increases of just under 15 per cent are achieved with better fertilizer inputs and seeds. The yield increases do&#13;
not demand additional labor as harvest is mechanized and the changes in cropping pattem do not create new labor demands..&#13;
f/ This model has four Simnental cows in both project situations. Milk production increases from 2800 1 to 3360 1 per cow per year with project.&#13;
Improved animal health, changed rations and better genetic material are expected to be accessible through improved extension and veterinary services.&#13;
The cropped area remains constant at 4.3 ha but the pattem changes with project. Maize silage and mixed grass pasture are introduced to boost feed&#13;
supply with project and maize for grain and the less productive meadow are reduced slightly. Mixed grass and other improved pastures would be&#13;
stimulated by project activities and gradually displace meadow and other unimproved pastures. Further increases in technical and financial performance&#13;
are possible, e.g. use of milk replacer for calf rearing or breed changes, and practical but have not been considered as they are still uncommon in&#13;
Croatia. Family labor requirements are virtually the same with and without project and are around 40 per cent of estimated available labor. There&#13;
is scope to expand the size of farms of this type but this is not considered within this project.&#13;

6.8    Farm economic analysis indicate positive incremental returns earned in each model, given the&#13;
NPCs estimated in Annex N of the Supplemental Volume. Even in Slavonija where several common crops&#13;
have higher NPCs, the usual practice on private farms is to feed these crops to livestock with strong&#13;
positive economic and financial results (see Table 8).&#13;

Project Econonic Rate of Return&#13;
6.9    A conservative estimate of incremental net economic benefits yields an economic rate of return&#13;
(ERR) of 28 percent. Project incremental benefits are based only on the economic farm returns as&#13;
identified under the indicative models described above; other potential benefits (such as export losses&#13;
avoided through improved animal disease control or increased seed export revenues through an improved&#13;
seed regulatory framework) have not been quantified. It is assumed that incremental benefits would occur&#13;
with only 5 percent of the farming community (i.e., 25,000 out of 500,00 farmers) and that benefits&#13;
would set-in only in the sixth year of a ten year time horizon (albeit benefits are expected to accrue well&#13;
beyond the tenth year and a considerably larger share of the farming community can be expected to&#13;
benefit from the project). Incremental project investment (including replacement) as well as recurrent&#13;
costs have been included net of taxes and duties (i.e., net of transfer payments). A fuller discussion of&#13;
the analysis is presented in Annex E.&#13;
6.10   Sensitivity analysis carried out on the base case ERR indicates that returns on this project are&#13;
robust. For instance, a simultaneous increase of project costs and decrease of benefits by 20 percent,&#13;
respectively results in an ERR of 15 percent (22 percent and 20 percent if costs and benefits, respectively,&#13;
are varied in isolation).&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
6.11   The potential resistance at the operational level by the various Government institutions and&#13;
services involved in the project to give up traditional influence and responsibilities following their&#13;
reorganization is a risk associated with the project. This would be addressed through a substantial training&#13;
program for the staff of these institutions with a focus on farm community participation and on the&#13;
rationale for the changes introduced under the project. Associated to this is the risk of a slow&#13;
establishment of an Agriculture Research Council and a National Seed Authority. This is being addressed&#13;
through considerable technical assistance provided both during pre-project start-up using Japanese grant&#13;

- 31 -&#13;
funds, and during early project implementation to work out procedures and to assist these nascent&#13;
institutions. A second risk lies in the number and size of procurement contracts to be implemented during&#13;
the first project years; to mitigate a procurement specialist has been hired prior to Loan Effectivness to&#13;
compile the major packages to be procured during the first project year. A third risk during&#13;
implementation stems from limited farmer capacity to form and support private associations, and the&#13;
potential limitations of extension and research staff to evolve with the market economy. This risk will be&#13;
counteracted by project activities which will focus technology development on efficiency increases,&#13;
improved farm management practices and product diversification; the assurance of unequivocal&#13;
Government support to farmer associations and farmer guided extension and research services; and a&#13;
focus of project design on farm community participation.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
6.12   The project has been placed in the environmental Category B. An Environmental Analysis (EA)&#13;
under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank has been carried out by an independent commission&#13;
appointed by MAF. The EA (Annex F) concludes: (i) no significant negative environmental impacts&#13;
associated with project implementation are to be expected; (ii) while private agriculture production is&#13;
likely to intensify, albeit from a low base, the intensity of the social sector production is likely to&#13;
decrease; and (iii) by the nature of the various project activities, in particular, extension and applied&#13;
research, agricultural practices would become environmentally safer. The EA also presents an inventory&#13;
of major environmental legislation relevant for the agriculture sector and concludes that while a whole&#13;
body of relevant environmental legislation has developed, enforcement has scope for improvement. The&#13;
EA underlines that project implementation would act as a catalyst to the further development of&#13;
environmental legislation and improved enforcement. Registration of agrochemicals and development of&#13;
Integrated Pest Management would be strengthened under the NSA (see para. 4.25).&#13;
6.13   No special mitigation plan has been required by the EA as no negative environmental impact is&#13;
directly caused by the project.; emphasis has been put on the extension services to provide guidance to&#13;
private farmers on the appropriate use of agro-chemicals. To support the concept of sustainable&#13;
agriculture and appropriate handling of agrochemicals, agreement will be sought during negotiations with&#13;
the Borrower, that MAF would develop environmental ('best practice') guidelines for its extension&#13;
service. These guidelines would give orientation to farmers on the safe and proper use of agro-chemicals&#13;
at the latest by April 30, 1997 as a dated covenant to the Loan agreement (see para. 7.1).&#13;
&#13;

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA&#13;
FARMERS SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX A&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
I. IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY&#13;
1.    The project would be implemented over a period of four years (CY96-99) after a period of&#13;
intensive pre-project activities in CY95 financed under a Japanese Grant. Prior to project effectiveness&#13;
major packages for procurement during the first year of implementation would be compiled.&#13;
2.    Overall Project Implementation. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry MAF would take&#13;
overall responsibility for project implementation, and direct responsibility for the implementation of the&#13;
agricultural extension and applied research components, for the policy analysis support component, and&#13;
for the veterinary epidemiological activities.&#13;
3.    Extension. The Deputy Minister Extension would take responsibility for implementing the&#13;
agriculture extension program. The extension service, which has its own budget and permanent staff,&#13;
would operate 21 Zupanija Extension Service Centers under the supervision of MAF. The broad functions&#13;
of the extension staff at headquarters would consist of: developing the diagnostic survey methodology;&#13;
supporting the national research prioritization process; facilitating research extension linkages; organizing&#13;
skill-gap based extension staff training; ensuring technical and market information flows; and developing&#13;
the mass media communication programs.&#13;
4.    The ZESCs would be staffed with 4 to 5 extension specialists in each of the 21 Zupanijas (no&#13;
incremental staff required). They would work through and support the creation of farmer groups, private&#13;
consultants and agro-industry and conduct on-farm demonstrations and mass media communications. The&#13;
ZESCs would be guided by local Advisory Committees with a broad representation of private farmers&#13;
in the Zupanija. Initially such farmer advisory committees would be formed with the assistance of the&#13;
ZESCs on an ad-hoc basis (in cooperation with the local chapters of the Croatian Farmers Association).&#13;
More formal procedures would be developed through the Advisory Committees once established.&#13;
5.    Some 45 local farmers associations would be supported through the project. Local farmers&#13;
associations interested in employing private advisors would be eligible for project grant funds through&#13;
MAF on a matching basis to pay for the salary of the advisor. Public support to fund a private farm&#13;
advisor salary would be based on the following formula: 80 percent of gross salary in year 1, 50 percent in year 2,&#13;
35 percent in year 3, and 25 percent in year 4. No support would be provided thereafter. The balance would be provided by the&#13;
farmer group. Associations would recruit suitably qualified advisors under a standard 4 year contract with&#13;
a 6 month probation period. Association and consultant compliance with the contract conditions would&#13;
be closely monitored by the ZESCs. Individual private consultants would be eligible to only one support&#13;
package over the project life. The roughly 45 groups under the farmer-based milk recording scheme&#13;
would be established in three selected Zupanija by the herd recording staff of the Croatian Livestock&#13;
Selection Center (CLSC).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                         - 38 -                       Project Implementation Plan&#13;
6.    Training for extension staff would commence with a trainers program for staff selected from&#13;
within the Zupanija extension service. The trainers would subsequently implement a retraining program&#13;
for extension staff at all levels including both headquarters and Zupanija, organized by the training&#13;
coordinator appointed to the headquarters of the Extension Department. Each three-four week training&#13;
program would be for about ten staff. This training would include practical field exercise. About 110 staff&#13;
would be trained in this manner during the first two years of project implementation. Additional courses&#13;
would be provided for scientific staff involved in adaptive research and for private extension advisors&#13;
hired under the farmer group scheme. Regular and special in-service training programs for extension staff&#13;
at all levels would also be introduced, organized by MAF's training coordinator. Overseas training would&#13;
be provided for four extension managers. They would participate in short-term training programs in&#13;
extension methodology with practical exposure to field operations in selected European countries. On&#13;
return, the trainees would be required to hold a series of seminars for extension staff and be required to&#13;
contribute to in-service staff training courses.&#13;
7.    Research. The Deputy Minister Agriculture together with the project manager would coordinate&#13;
the establishment of the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) and provide guidance to the ARC during&#13;
project implementation. The ARC, responsible for the allocation of the national applied agriculture&#13;
research budget, would be independent of MAF but answerable to the Minister of Agriculture and&#13;
Forestry. MOST would be responsible for the general administration of applied research contracts; this&#13;
would include screening research proposals, procurement of research equipment associated with the&#13;
research contracts, and off-site and on-site supervision of research work. The establishment of the ARC&#13;
as well as the formulation of the operating procedures would take place prior to project effectiveness with&#13;
technical assistance funded under the Japanese Grant.&#13;
8.    The project would support an applied agriculture research management system to produce relevant&#13;
and timely information for the private family farmers. The establishment of an independent Agriculture&#13;
Research Council (ARC) which would establish research policy and priorities for funding applied&#13;
agriculture research would be key to ensuring relevance and timeliness of research to farmers. The ARC&#13;
would consist of a majority of farmer representatives (9 members nominated from each of the nine&#13;
agriculture regions); in addition, ARC would consist of one representative from MAF and MOST,&#13;
respectively, three representatives from the research community, and one from agrobusiness. The&#13;
Minister of Agriculture and Forestry would nominate the chairperson of the ARC.&#13;
9.    Demand-driven research. The ARC would invite the scientific community (both public and private&#13;
sector) on the basis of publicly announced Terms of Reference, to submit research proposals to the&#13;
council, i.e. contracts for applied research would be demand driven. The research agenda would be (i)&#13;
open-ended and determined by the ARC, and (ii) would allow for a broad scope of topics to be researched&#13;
ranging from production technology to market research and development. Any bona fide Croatian&#13;
research institution, public or private, would be eligible to participate under the competitive research&#13;
grant system. The ARC shall make such rules and establish procedures as required openly to carry out&#13;
its responsibility. The Council shall also promulgate procedures and select participants for external and&#13;
internal training of scientific and faculty personnel supported under the project.. The Ministry of Science&#13;
and Technology (MOST) would carry out the technical and scientific review (involving national and&#13;
foreign reviewers) of the submitted proposals and would submit to the ARC short lists of proposals in&#13;
the respective areas of applied research for decision making. MOST would administer, supervise&#13;
(including on-site supervision) and audit the research contracts. The ARC would be assisted by a small&#13;
(one or two) person secretariat which would call the ARC meetings on the initiative of the Chairperson.&#13;
It would also be responsible to liaise with MOST and to also carry-out on-site supervision of applied&#13;
research contracts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                    - 39 -                                       ANNEX A&#13;
10.   Agriculture Research Fund. Applied agriculture research would be funded on a competitive grant&#13;
basis through an Agriculture Research Fund which would finance incremental equipment and research&#13;
costs. In order to ensure that both regional and national research priorities are being addressed, a funding&#13;
formula would be agreed upon by the ARC, for a period not shorter than three years, which would&#13;
allocated funds to the main agriculture regions (based on the relative contribution to agriculture GDP)&#13;
and to overall national research. In the context of applied research, MOST would continue, as in the past,&#13;
to finance the salaries and basic operating costs of the public research institutions; MOST would also&#13;
continue to support basic agriculture research (including salaries, buildings, utilities and equipment) and&#13;
continue to support and pay for post graduate students.&#13;
11.   Research - Extension - Farmer linkages would be strengthened through the following steps:&#13;
(i) relevance of future applied research would be improved by the above approach, which focuses&#13;
on farmer representation both at the district and the national level.&#13;
(ii) invitations for applied research proposals would request a concept by the bidder on how the&#13;
research results would reach the extension services and farmers; this concept would be part of&#13;
the overall proposal evaluation;&#13;
(iii) field trials and demonstrations to be carried out by the extension services and by contracted&#13;
researchers under the competitive grant system would be linked to the research proposals in&#13;
order to ensure on-farm experimentation. The successful research bidder would engage in&#13;
contracts with individual farmers to carry out on-farm trials under the supervision of the&#13;
researcher.&#13;
12.   Animal Heath. The animal health program would be managed by MAF's Veterinary Department&#13;
while diagnostic work would be under the responsibility of the NVI.&#13;
13.   Pasture and Fodder Development. The grassland program would be managed and implemented&#13;
by the Department of Grassland and Fodder Development, Agricultural Faculty, Zagreb University.&#13;
14.   Seed Industry Development. MAF's Agriculture Department would establish the National Seed&#13;
Authority (NSA) which would subsequently administer the national seed industry quality control and&#13;
regulatory policy, as well as agro-chemical registration.&#13;
15.   Policy Analysis Support. MAF's Policy Department would be responsible for restructuring its&#13;
Agriculture Policy Analysis Unit, hiring the required additional staff, contracting selected policy studies,&#13;
and for establishing the market information system. The one-time farm baseline survey and the annual&#13;
farm monitoring exercises would be carried out by the Institute of Agriculture Economics, University of&#13;
Zagreb.&#13;
16.   Technical Assistance. The TA program envisaged for the project (some 75 months amounting to&#13;
some US$1.8 million) is essential for project success. In order to ensure timely recruitment of key TA,&#13;
hiring the extension specialists, the research management specialist, and the long term policy specialist&#13;
would take place at the latest by June 30, 1996 (i.e. six months after effectiveness).&#13;
17.   The following Implementation Arrangement by Components gives a breakdown of major&#13;
activities, responsibilities and summary description of tasks on a component basis.&#13;

m. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION FOR AGRICULTURE EXTENSION&#13;
A. Rationale and Design of the Project&#13;
18.   The four-year project must lay the foundation for the effective delivery of farner services and&#13;
develop a momentum for the continuing development of new technology and farm management practices&#13;
responsive to the needs of the private farmer.&#13;
19.   With the development of land holding legislation and economic liberalization in general, farming&#13;
in Croatia will rapidly change. These developments will press farmers to increase farm size, through&#13;
acquisition or lease, and to change their production mix, as well as their production systems in response&#13;
to price changes and new market opportunities. Among the factors that will stimulate change are:&#13;
(i) the return of tourism to the Adriatic coast, which will expand the market for high quality,&#13;
ecologically clean products;&#13;
(ii) the growing awareness to environmental issues and to healthy food, and the realization&#13;
that Croatia may have a comparative advantage in producing healthy food for the&#13;
European market; and&#13;
(iii) the low labor costs offers prospects for the development of labor-intensive production.&#13;
20.   Low input techniques are more knowledge intensive, if they are to be reliable and profitable.&#13;
Practicing a more rational use of inputs to maximize income, rather than yields, also requires fine tuning&#13;
at farm level. The adaptation of Croatia's farmers to the new circumstances requires new skills, as well&#13;
as closer links with scientists and technicians to develop these techniques. This link is provided through&#13;
the extension services.&#13;
21.   Given the uncertainties regarding the future of the social farms and cooperatives, and the&#13;
continuing processes of economic restructuring, the short-term option is to improve the operational&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of the small state-financed extension service. However, a progression to a&#13;
semi-privatized advisory service must be an objective and parallel development of private consultants&#13;
would be supported through the project. Future private sector advisory services could emerge through&#13;
farmer-owned cooperatives, commodity associations and agribusiness. Such initiatives would also be&#13;
encouraged during project implementation. Progressively, farmers are expected to absorb an increasing&#13;
share of the costs of their advisory services.&#13;
22.   The current structure is being reorganized at all levels. At the Ministry level, a clear definition&#13;
of responsibilities has been agreed, providing a direct line of communication between the extension&#13;
service and the Ministry and the new Agriculture Research Council. The nucleus Zupanija Extension&#13;
Support Centers (ZESCs) is being established and officers will have a career structure and salary scales,&#13;
awarding for performance.&#13;
23.   The farmers of Croatia are a heterogeneous group, and so are their advisory requirements.&#13;
However, with the limited staffing resources available, it will not be possible to give cover to all farmers&#13;
on a one-to-one basis. Knowledge on the present situation and performance of these farmers will be&#13;
crucial to the design and extension strategies and activities. The current constraints on transport,&#13;
equipment and extension aids will have to be addressed and the knowledge and skills mix of the extension&#13;
service developed through a broad training program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                      - 47 -                                        ANNEX A&#13;
24.   The future public extension service will have to operate within the limits of a severe budget&#13;
constraint and care must be taken to control recurrent costs. These cost constraints will prevent any major&#13;
increases in staff numbers, yet farmer contact must be increased, the operational efficiency must also be&#13;
improved and the effective delivery of relevant packages given priority. The Zupanija Extension Support&#13;
Center (ZESC) will therefore operate as the core resource center for the rural community. It should be&#13;
guided by a Zupanija extension advisory committee with strong representation from the local farmer&#13;
community, and operate on the basis of "client ownership". With limited staff resources, the ZESCs&#13;
would have to operate through farmer groups and use production/ marketing/management associations&#13;
as their primary contacts to the extent possible.&#13;
25.   Extension support services to individual farmers would have to be built through the private sector,&#13;
working in co-operation with the ZESCs and utilizing their technical resources.&#13;
26.   The focus of the future program would be on increasing farmer incomes. In the short term this&#13;
requires a thorough, critical review of past relevant research and where it can be applied, and also the&#13;
identification of the improved practices of progressive farmers through farming systems analysis. The&#13;
research program, conversely, would need to be devised jointly between scientists and producers to&#13;
develop short-term action programs to develop appropriate technologies. The effective establishment of&#13;
this linkage through a farmer guided extension service forms the main rationale of this component.&#13;
B. Objectives and Strategies&#13;
27.   The objective is to provide an extension system, within the existing fiscal, economic and social&#13;
constraints, that helps the development of sustainable increases in private farm family income and well&#13;
being. The extension service would aim do this by the provision of sound business management,&#13;
marketing and technical advice and information to farmers and their families using the most effective and&#13;
efficient communication procedures.&#13;
28.   The component, as proposed, would link agricultural extension and research workers with farmers&#13;
in the identification of production constraints and opportunities, and the development of appropriate&#13;
strategies for their solution or exploitation.&#13;
29.    More specifically, the objectives would be:&#13;
(i) to generate information on the current systems used by farmers and to identify areas&#13;
where improvements can be made;&#13;
(ii) to improve the efficiency of technology transfer and improve the relevance of information&#13;
to farmers' specific problems;&#13;
(iii)  to train and equip the extension service to adjust to the new economic environment; and&#13;
(iv) to develop an operating mode conducive to building increased co-operation and&#13;
participation between both public and private extension and research, and the farming&#13;
community.&#13;
&#13;

C. Project Components&#13;
30.   Support to Public Extension Services. Under the project the existing public Zupanija (district)&#13;
extension offices (21 with a total staff of some 110) would develop into community supervised Zupanija&#13;
Extension Service Centers (ZESC). These would provide the impetus to farmer group formation (see&#13;
below) and act as a source of infonnation and specialized guidance to private advisers directly serving&#13;
the farmers. The ZESC would be assisted through voluntary local Advisory Committees representing the&#13;
local farming community and agro-business. Office, computer and teaching equipment, and vehicles&#13;
would be made available to the ZESCs.&#13;
31.   Detailed Features:&#13;
Zupanija Extension Service Centers (ZESCs). The existing county extension centers (one in each&#13;
of the 21 Zupanija) would be developed in to Zupanija Extension Service Centers (ZESCs) and&#13;
consist of a professional team of 4-5 extension officers and one support staff, led by an extension&#13;
coordinator.&#13;
Each ZESC would be provided with two cars and mileage allowance for staff-owned cars.&#13;
Provision is also made for office accommodation at the Zupanija headquarters including rentals,&#13;
communication and office equipment supplies. Each would be provided with a set of office&#13;
furniture,  three  personal  computers,  appropriate  software,  and  a  photocopier.&#13;
Extension/communication equipment, including slide and overhead projectors, VDO and camera&#13;
would be included. To support the development of ZESC activities, the project would provide&#13;
funds for on-farm technology testing, publication of extension material, the production of a farm&#13;
management handbook, and for subscriptions to magazines.&#13;
32.   Diagnostic Survey. During early project implementation, each ZESC would carry out a one-time,&#13;
farm community based diagnostic survey in order to develop a thorough understanding of the constraints&#13;
and potential of the areas they are servicing, and to give the extension services the opportunity to inform&#13;
farmers in their area of the new extension approach. The diagnostic survey exercise would help define&#13;
the annual working program of the Zupanija extension service (a systematic working program, including&#13;
monitorable performance indicators for the public extension services was developed in 1995 for the first&#13;
time) MAF's extension department with TA provided under a Japanese Grant funding would develop a&#13;
simple methodology to carry out these diagnostic surveys.&#13;
33.   Private Extension Support. The formation of a limited number of farmer groups (some 45&#13;
groups, roughly 2 groups in each Zupanija) on a pilot basis would be supported in view of farmer groups&#13;
employing private advisors in agricultural production, farm business management, and marketing&#13;
associations management on a matching grant basis. Each group would directly employ its own adviser&#13;
who would be funded by MAF during the first four years on a matching grant basis and receive some&#13;
basic training equipment on a grant basis. The public extension service would develop standard contracts&#13;
and provide the newly established farmer groups with legal advice during the process of hiring private&#13;
advisors.&#13;
34.   Detailed Features:&#13;
Support to Farmers Associations. The project would encourage farmers to form self-help groups&#13;
with a common interest in technology development, bulk supply of inputs, product marketing,&#13;
or in sharing equipment, essentially by: (i) limiting time spent by the public extension officers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                      - 49 -                                        ANNEX A&#13;
with individual farmers and extending public extension efforts with farmer groups; (ii) offering&#13;
legal and administrative information/advice on formal group formation; and (iii) providing&#13;
technical and managerial training to group leaders. Such training would include both informal&#13;
training, extended during visits or short seminars by zupanija staff, and formal training, which&#13;
would be organized at national level and involve guest speakers from agribusiness.&#13;
Private Sector Extension Services.  The provision of private advisory services would be&#13;
developed in conjunction with the establishment of farmer associations. Such associations would&#13;
be eligible under the project to receive grants to directly hire on a full time basis qualified&#13;
professional agricultural staff (many of which are presently with the public sector). It is&#13;
anticipated that some 45 groups employing advisers be forned within the duration of the project.&#13;
Grants would cover: (1) training in business, marketing and extension management.; (2) partial&#13;
salary support for farmer association employing a private consultants over a four year period on&#13;
a matching grant basis (based on the following matching grant formula: 80% in year 1, 50% in&#13;
year 2, 35% in year 3, and 25 in year 4; no support would be provided thereafter; the balance&#13;
would be provided by the farmer group) ; (3) provision of basic equipment (computer &amp; printer&#13;
etc.) to the farmer group.&#13;
35.   Farmer-based Milk Recording Pilot Scheme. Also on a pilot basis, farmer herd recording&#13;
groups (some 45 in three Zupanijas) would be supported through the Croatian Livestock Selection Center&#13;
(CLSC) in close collaboration with the ZESC to promote farmer based milk recording. Milk recording&#13;
data, an important management tool in milk and animal production would be used by the extension&#13;
service and the farmer herd recording group. Farmer-based milk recording would also be a first step in&#13;
supporting private animal breeding efforts and in reducing the high costs of animal performance recording&#13;
presently carried out by the public sector. Project support would include milk production recording&#13;
equipment, limited computer equipment, and industry staff training including a study tour to selected&#13;
European animal breeding programs.&#13;
36.   Training Program. A substantial training program, including: a trainers of trainer program; a&#13;
one-time general staff orientation course; and regular and specialized in-service training, would be carried&#13;
out to enable the staff of the extension service to acquire the skills necessary to operate under a changed&#13;
mandate. Subjects would include farm business management, financial and marketing skills, group&#13;
formation skills, preparation of mass media and training packages, and information management. The&#13;
training of trainer program would be carried out prior to project start-up financed through a Japanese&#13;
Grant. Limited study tours would also be carried out by selected extension experts to get a better&#13;
understanding of extension issues and operations in other countries. Private advisors working under the&#13;
farmer group pilot scheme would also participate in this training program.&#13;
37.   Detailed Features:&#13;
A Reorientation Training program would be supported by the project for all extension officers.&#13;
The staff would undertake a short course designed to familiarize them with the role and activities&#13;
of the extension service. The course would be conducted by senior extension staff who would&#13;
themselves be trained through a eight week training course, designed and conducted by an&#13;
internationally recruited consultant. This training of trainers would take place prior to project&#13;
start-up. All other extension staff would receive their training within two years of the trainers&#13;
being trained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX A                                        - 50 -                        Project Implementation Plan&#13;
The project would also support a Regular annual In-service Training program for extension&#13;
service staff. Extension staff would participate in a one-week training course at the zonal level,&#13;
designed to update their knowledge and skills, based on the extension themes for that particular&#13;
year. A full-time training and staff development coordinator would be appointed at headquarters&#13;
with the task of organizing these annual training programs and conducting skill-gap analysis for&#13;
all staff.&#13;
Additional Specialized Technical Training would be provided to extension staff in making the&#13;
best use of mass media including radio, the press and TV and in technologies of production&#13;
where skill gaps are identified. Training would be provided by specialists from Croatia and by&#13;
internationally recruited consultants.&#13;
Short-term Overseas Training would be supported for eight staff (4 agro-economists and&#13;
4 extension officers) for three months each at appropriate training institutions to gain experience&#13;
in training organization, skill job analysis and extension methods and administration.&#13;
38.   Mass Media Programs. Approximately 25 thematic training packages would be developed for&#13;
use by Zupanija extension service staff and other advisers for incorporation within an extension program&#13;
for farmers. The training packages would also form the basis of mass media activities which would be&#13;
developed on a contractual basis involving the extension and research services. Topics would include farm&#13;
business management, improving marketing arrangements of primary producers, and technical items such&#13;
as integrated crop production and pest management.&#13;
39.   Detailed Features:&#13;
The extension service would introduce the use of mass media techniques in widening its farmer&#13;
contact capacity. Professional producers (TV and radio) would be commissioned to prepare&#13;
programs on specific themes being extended in collaboration with the extension and research&#13;
services.. Content would be both technical or of general interest to the rural communities. An&#13;
allowance of roughly US$430,000 has been included to cover the costs of production of about&#13;
25 programs over four years.&#13;
40.   On-farm Trials and Demonstration: Farmer - Extension Research Link. A on-farm trial and&#13;
demonstration program would be carried out through the ZESC in coordination with agriculture&#13;
researchers perusing competitive grant-based applied research supported through the project (see para&#13;
below).&#13;
41.   Technical Assistance. Four areas of TA would be required during the life of the project:&#13;
*  three months consultancy for the training of trainers (which would be financed under the&#13;
Japanese Grant Facility);&#13;
*  eleven months consultancy on extension methodology, adaptive research priorities, design and&#13;
evaluation of trials; management and organization of an extension program, program&#13;
monitoring and evaluation;&#13;
*  three months consultancy for special skills training amongst extension staff: audio-visual&#13;
communication, farmer association organization, farm business management, financial and&#13;
marketing skills, information management, trials and demonstration management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Project Implementation Plan                    - 51 -                                      ANNEX A&#13;
* nine months of local consultant time in media production, support to farmers marketing&#13;
associations, guest speakers at local training sessions, and computing skills.&#13;
D. Environmental Guidelines&#13;
42.   In order to ensure sustainability of agriculture production and the safe use and handling of&#13;
agrochemicals, MAF would develop environmental ("best practice") guidelines for the extension services&#13;
in line with applicable environmental legislation no later than 12 months after effectiveness (see para. 7.2&#13;
in the SAR).&#13;
E. Organization, Management and Implementation&#13;
43.   The extension program would be managed and implemented through the Extension Division of&#13;
the MAF headed by the Deputy Minister (Extension). There will be three tiers of management&#13;
(i) MAF Headquarters&#13;
(ii) Zupanija Extension Service Centers&#13;
(iii) Farmer advisers&#13;
44.   The extension program would be managed and implemented through the Extension Division&#13;
established within MAF under the Deputy Minister (Extension). The extension service is a separate&#13;
operations service, has its own budget and permanent staff. The extension division would be responsible&#13;
for its own staff recruitment. A recent staff ranking system has been established which provides for all&#13;
professional staff to improve their position based on merit.&#13;
45.   The HQ staff comprise an operations manager, information/media officer, a general agriculturalist&#13;
with comprehensive experience in dealing with farmers, and a training officer.&#13;
HEADQUARTERS STAFFNG&#13;
46.   The HQ Division, apart from the general management of the service, would have the following&#13;
broad functions:&#13;
(i) Designing and coordinating the training programs: reorientation, in-service and technical;&#13;
(ii) selecting candidates for overseas training;&#13;
(iii) collaboration with the Agriculture Research Council in defining national research&#13;
priorities;&#13;
(iv) reviewing existing research requests and identifying technology gaps between&#13;
"progressive" and "average" farmers in the formulation of short-term extension advice -&#13;
packages;&#13;
(v)  maintain linkages to the research community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                          - 52 -                        Project Implementation Plan&#13;
(vi) providing technical, economic and market information to field extension staff, and&#13;
generally sustaining a farmer profit-oriented approach to be promoted by extension staff;&#13;
and&#13;
(vii) participation in and developing mass media programs.&#13;
TRANING&#13;
47.    Training of trainers. All field staff recruited to the new extension service would require extensive&#13;
re-training. In view of the comprehensive training programs required, it is proposed to first implement&#13;
a trainers' program to produce qualified staff to cater for the various training needs prior to project start-&#13;
up of field operations. The training of 12 trainers (eight general agriculturalists and four with farm&#13;
management/economics experience) and who are receptive to new ideas would be supported. It is&#13;
expected that these trainers would also evolve into leadership functions within the extension service. This&#13;
trainers' program would be funded under a Japanese Grant Fund.&#13;
48.   The trainers would complete an intensive two-month course which would include the following&#13;
general subjects: a market economy and how it operates; the meaning of economic competitiveness from&#13;
the production perspective - focusing on profit increases, rather than production; the changing economy&#13;
and its implications for farmers for their production mix, and for extension; the role and potential of&#13;
small family farms, advantages and disadvantages; investment analysis; gross margin and whole farm&#13;
system analysis; participatory constraint analysis of the family farm; how to learn from farmers - listening&#13;
as an effective tool in gaining farmers' confidence; public speaking skills, the use of extension aids to&#13;
teaching and learning; extension through farmer groups - group dynamics and management, how to formn&#13;
extension groups; the need for and advantages of continuing interaction between extension agents&#13;
researchers and farmers. To the extent necessary, familiarization with computers and the necessary&#13;
analytical tools would be included in the training program. The training would be practically orientated,&#13;
with regular on-farm exercises interacting with farm families operating differing production systems with&#13;
various resource capacities. The training specialist would prepare guidelines and course material for&#13;
extension staff training to be carried out by the trainers.&#13;
49.   Reorientation training. The reorientation training would cover all extension staff. Over the first&#13;
two years of the project, the total staff complement would receive training. The course would focus on&#13;
the operational changes needed to effectively transfer relevant information which would be adopted by&#13;
farmers. A two-week course would be held based on the curricula outlined above. Each training course&#13;
for about ten officers would be carried out by the trainers over a two-week period. Provision is made for&#13;
other specialists, including the media to participate. The program would be organized by the training&#13;
specialist of MAF's Extension Department.&#13;
50.   In-service technical training. In-service training would focus on up-to-date technology&#13;
development from research, the latest development in market opportunities and on the extension themes&#13;
developed for various farming systems. This training schedule would provide for a forum to discuss&#13;
current farm constraints encountered by field staff. Regular in-service training would be central to&#13;
maintaining a responsive and motivated extension operation and establish a base for research extension&#13;
dialogue. The training officer from HQ would prepare and organize the program. The four Zonal&#13;
Research Extension Coordination Units (ZERCU) to be supported under the project would play a vital&#13;
role, both in delivery of technical packages and as listeners to problems identified by extension staff. The&#13;
media would also be involved and would benefit from the subject matter discussions for the formulation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                      - 53 -                                       ANNEX A&#13;
of their programs. The training sessions would be for one week and would be supported by other&#13;
specialists as found relevant. Inputs would be required from agribusiness, banks and progressive farmers.&#13;
51.   Overseas training. Eight officers (four agro-economists and four extension officers) would be&#13;
selected for overseas visits of three months during the first three years of the project. The visits program&#13;
would be set up to cater both for short formal courses in extension methodology and practical exposure&#13;
to operations in the field. The candidates would have shown the necessary aptitude to absorb and&#13;
communicate and would necessarily have fluency in a West European language. On return, the trainees&#13;
would be required to hold a series of seminars for extension staff and be required to participate in in-&#13;
service staff training courses.&#13;
MONIORING AND CONTROL OF THE EXTENSION SERVICE&#13;
52.   Baseline survey. Monitoring and control functions are essential for effective management. The&#13;
effectiveness of extension programs are very difficult to assess because of the wide range of factors that&#13;
affect farmer decision making and profitability most of which are outside the control of the extension&#13;
staff. (Price movements and weather patterns are obvious examples). Nevertheless the changes in the&#13;
farming community need to be identified. To identify whether progress towards the objectives has been&#13;
made, a baseline survey would be carried out by the Institute of Agriculture Economic in Year one of&#13;
the project and that it is repeated in five years time to assess changes. The survey would aim to measure&#13;
current production parameters and farmer attitudes. (See Chapter VIII, on Policy Analysis Unit.)&#13;
53.   Component Performance. In addition, MAF's Department of Extension and Agriculture would&#13;
be responsible for monitoring project performance on the basis of the indicators outlined in Annex D.)&#13;
SHE ZUPANIA EXTENSION SERVICE CENTERS (ZESCS)&#13;
54.   The 21 centers would be strengthened during the first two years of the project. Although based&#13;
at the Zupanija administrative centers, the ZESC staff would report directly on technical and operational&#13;
matters to their headquarters in Zagreb. The administrative head of the Zupanija would be fully informed&#13;
of the content and planning of field extension programs and his advice and assistance sought in&#13;
mobilization of the farmer community and to provide support and endorse media campaigns. The ZESCs&#13;
would have no administrative responsibilities within the Zupanija structure.&#13;
55.   ZESCAdvisory Committees would be established in each zupanija to assist the ZESC staff identify&#13;
and meet the needs of the farmers. Membership would comprise of a majority of farmers with&#13;
representatives of produce buyers and the supply industry. Initially members would be appointed by&#13;
appropriate organizations including the Croatian Farmers Association. In future elections could be held.&#13;
Total membership would be 9. The secretariat would be provided by the ZESC. Committee Members&#13;
would represent the Zupanija on the advisory board of the Zonal Research Extension Coordination Units&#13;
(see Chapter IV, on Research).&#13;
56.   The ZESC team would maintain a close liaison and give operational support to the Advisory&#13;
Committees who would be their link to the formulation of research programs. They would provide&#13;
information on technical and market constraints.&#13;
57.   Each Zupanija has a different density of farmers and mix of farm holding sizes and systems.&#13;
Given the limited number of staff available and the large number of farmers the Zupanija extension&#13;
service would be structured as a resource center with four main objectives:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                          - 54 -                        Project Implementation Plan&#13;
(i)  To provide information to private sector and other 'front line' advisers.&#13;
(ii) To encourage the establishment of self help farmer groups.&#13;
(iii) To provide specialist support and advice to advisers and farmers.&#13;
(iv) To provide feedback to MAF headquarters.&#13;
58.    The center would be staffed by a senior extension specialist (The Center Manager), supported&#13;
by 3-4 specialists, depending on the agricultural importance of the area, its cropping systems and the mix&#13;
of enterprises. Additional extension staff may be provided by the Zupanija (As is the case at Poric.)&#13;
59.   Some individual farmer advice is inevitable and will continue to be necessary. Farmers will&#13;
continue to visit the extension officer and field visits by staff will be required to ensure that problems&#13;
have been correctly diagnosed and to establish the context in which the request for advice has been made.&#13;
Other visits will be necessary in order that the ZESC staff keep in touch with the needs of the farming&#13;
industry. This could occupy about 15 per cent of an adviser's time.&#13;
60.   The ZESCs would operate through farmer groups and rely heavily on videos and listening tapes&#13;
and the use of mass media (radio, television and the press). Farmers groups would be set up and group&#13;
responsibilities allocated to individual officers and routine visit programs organized. To provide adequate&#13;
coverage of groups (20 groups with about 20 farmers) and assuming 4-5 visits/year, the extension officer&#13;
would be required to spend about three days/week in the field. These visits would be supported by field&#13;
demonstrations prepared by the farmers themselves with guidance from the extension officer. These&#13;
demonstrations would support the thematic approach which is the core of the methodology and would&#13;
concentrate on lower production costs, improved profitability, market demand, comparative advantage,&#13;
chemical application rates, increasing farmer bargaining power, improvements in tillage, and soil moisture&#13;
management, irrigation investment, analysis, etc.&#13;
MAss MEDIA EXTENSION&#13;
61.   The mass media already make a substantial contribution to the dissemination of farmer&#13;
information. Farm programs have a wide audience, and considerable scope exists for expansion of the&#13;
service. The project would therefore seek to generate a substantial information base for program content.&#13;
The training officer in the Ministry would be responsible for the co-ordination of mass media extension&#13;
and for developing information channels. He would have funds at his disposal to employ local media&#13;
consultants for specific tasks.&#13;
ROLE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
62.   The principle of a limited public extension system operating at Zupanija level is fully supported&#13;
by MAF. MAF also wishes to control recurrent costs and to retain highly qualified staff and to invest in&#13;
their training and equipment. It is fully realized that initially they will be resource persons, and individual&#13;
farmer contact will be limited;  considerable emphasis is therefore laid on the use of multiple&#13;
communication channels, including mass media.&#13;
63.    MAF supports the provision of 'front line' advice by private extension and consultancy services.&#13;
There is a pool of staff available from the former municipalities and from the AK support services that&#13;
could be gainfully employed in a private sector role, complementary to the public services proposed.&#13;
64.   The project would encourage the use of paid-for services, which meet a demand, from farmers&#13;
organizations/associations (individual well-off farmers have generally access to good information).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                     - 55 -                                        ANNEX A&#13;
65.   There are no legal obstacles to the formation of private consulting companies.&#13;
F. Envrionmental Impact&#13;
66.   The modification to tillage practices would have a positive effect on improving infiltration rates&#13;
and soil moisture relationships. There will be a positive effect on controlling run-off and soil and wind&#13;
erosion.&#13;
67.   The overall strengthening of the extension service would assist farmers in the safe and rational&#13;
use of plant protection chemicals. The increased use of integrated pest management techniques, awarded&#13;
priority under the adaptive research program, should provide for a general reduction in chemical use.&#13;

IV. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION FOR AGRICULTURE RESEARCH&#13;
A. Components Objectives and Activities&#13;
SUMMARY&#13;
68.   The main objective of the component would be to develop a research service responsive to serving&#13;
the requirements of private farm families now operating in a market economy. More specific objectives&#13;
would be:&#13;
(i) to initiate and sustain a process where past academic and production orientated research is&#13;
replaced by a more analytical, multidisciplinary, economic and producer constraint&#13;
orientated approach;&#13;
(ii) to establish effective participation of producers in identifying priorities for research and&#13;
deciding on allocation of funds to research projects;&#13;
(iii) to introduce rational planning of research projects to resolve readily identifiable constraints&#13;
at farm level, with due consideration of the total socio-economic farm system;&#13;
(iv) to provide for a system which can generate research projects, award priorities and&#13;
effectively implement them;&#13;
(v) to develop strong linkages between research and extension through which technology transfer&#13;
and information flow maintains relevance to farmers' needs;&#13;
(vi) to better equip the research services to adjust to the requirements of private farming needs&#13;
and to enable them to implement contract research at field level;&#13;
69.   Component Activities would consist of the following:&#13;
70.   The Agriculture Research Council. The project would support an applied agriculture research&#13;
management system to produce relevant and timely information for the private family farmers. The&#13;
establishment of an independent Agriculture Research Council (ARC) which would establish research&#13;
policy and priorities for funding applied agriculture research would be key to ensuring relevance and&#13;
timeliness of research to farmers. The ARC would consist of a majority of farmer representatives (9&#13;
members nominated from each of the nine agriculture regions). The chairperson would be appointed by&#13;
the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry upon nomination of the ARC. Other council members would&#13;
consist of a representative of MAF, a representative from the Ministry of Science and Technology&#13;
(MOST), three representatives of the scientific community, and one from the agrobusiness sector. The&#13;
research agenda would be (i) open-ended and determined by the ARC, and (ii) would allow for a broad&#13;
scope of topics to be researched ranging from production technology to market research and development.&#13;
Any bona fide Croatian research institution, public or private, would be eligible to participate under the&#13;
competitive research grant system.&#13;
71.          Demand-driven research. The ARC would invite the scientific community (both public&#13;
and private sector) on the basis of publicly announced Terms of Reference, to submit research proposals&#13;
to the council, i.e. contracts for applied research would be demand driven. The ARC shall make such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                         - 60 -                        Project Implementation Plan&#13;
rules and establish procedures as required openly to carry out its responsibility. The Council shall also&#13;
promulgate procedures and select participants for external and internal training of scientific and faculty&#13;
personnel supported under the project. MOST would carry out the technical and scientific review&#13;
(involving national and foreign reviewers) of the submitted proposals and would submit to the ARC&#13;
shortlists of proposals in the respective areas of applied research for decision making. MOST would&#13;
administer, supervise (including on-site supervision) and audit the research contracts. The ARC would&#13;
be assisted by a small (one or two) person secretariat which would call the ARC meetings on the initiative&#13;
of the Chairperson. It would also be responsible to liaise with MOST and to also carry-out on-site&#13;
supervision of applied research contracts.&#13;
72.   Agriculture Research Fund. Applied agriculture research would be funded on a competitive grant&#13;
basis through an Agriculture Research Fund which would finance incremental equipment and research&#13;
costs. In the context of applied research, MOST would continue, as in the past, to finance the salaries&#13;
and basic operating costs of the public research institutions; MOST would also continue to support basic&#13;
agriculture research (including salaries, buildings, utilities and equipment) and continue to support and&#13;
pay for post graduate students.&#13;
73.   The Agriculture Research Fund would be established under the authority of the ARC. During&#13;
project implementation this fund would be financed to a large extent through the World Bank loan&#13;
(roughly estimated at around 80%) with the balance from budget allocations (roughly 20%). In order&#13;
to ensure that both regional and national research priorities are being addressed a funding formula would&#13;
be agreed upon by the ARC, for a period not shorter than three years, which would allocated funds to&#13;
the main agriculture regions (based on the relative contribution to agriculture GDP) and to overall&#13;
national research. In order to ensure financial sustainability of the Agriculture Research Fund, MAF is&#13;
committed to introduce in the course of project implementation modest commodity based levies paid by&#13;
the producer, once the overall concept has gained credibility within the farming community. This&#13;
credibility is largely a function of the relevance and quality of the applied research and the associated&#13;
independence of the ARC.&#13;
74.   Research - Extension - Farmer Linkages would be strengthened through the following steps:&#13;
(i) relevance of future applied research would be improved by the above approach, which&#13;
focuses on farmer representation both at the district and the national level. At the district&#13;
level, extension and research would be guided by farmer advisory committees, the ZESC&#13;
Advisory Committees, and Zonal Advisory Committees of four small Zonal Research&#13;
Extension Coordination Units. These district and zonal advisory committees would meet&#13;
regularly, and would guide the initiatives of the Zupanija extension staff. The Zonal&#13;
Research Extension Coordination Units, each consisting of two professional staff, would&#13;
establish a formal link between the research community (in particular with researcher&#13;
under contract from the ARC), and the public and private extension services, and would&#13;
assist in the coordination of on-field trials and demonstrations. A first Zonal Research&#13;
Extension Coordination Unit would be established in the second year of the project, while&#13;
the other three be set up subsequently after evaluation of the performance of the first&#13;
unit. At the national level, farmer representatives, nominated by their peers from the&#13;
district and zonal Advisory Committee, would ensure that farmers' problems become the&#13;
focus of the future research agenda;&#13;
(ii) invitations for applied research proposals would request a concept by the bidder on how&#13;
the research results would reach the extension services and farmers; this concept would&#13;
be part of the overall proposal evaluation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                    - 61 -                                      ANNEX A&#13;
(iii) the project has budgeted for field trials and demonstrations to be carried out by the&#13;
extension services; the field trials would be linked to the research proposals in order to&#13;
ensure on-farm experimentation. The successful research bidder would engage in&#13;
contracts with individual farmers to carry out on-farm trials under the supervision of the&#13;
researcher.&#13;
75.   Project support. The project would support the establishment of the ARC by providing: (i)&#13;
technical assistance (partly through a Japanese Grant) to initially work out and during implementation&#13;
improve the operational procedures of the competitive grant based research management system; (ii)&#13;
office and computer equipment, and a vehicles; and (iii) covering initial operating costs of the Council&#13;
and the secretariat.&#13;
76.   The project would provide the ARC with an Agriculture Research Fund of roughly US$5.2&#13;
million over four years which would finance all the public supported applied and adoptive agricultural&#13;
research (including equipment requirements) carried out in the country during the course of project&#13;
implementation. The amount to be provided under the Agriculture Research Fund has been established&#13;
in function of the amount of resources that could be levied from the farming community in the future;&#13;
and by estimating costs of four indicative research programs identified by the research community as&#13;
being of potentially high priority. Basic agricultural research would remain under the auspices of MOST.&#13;
77.   Under the project a training program for applied research staff would be carried out; including&#13;
a visiting scientist program, a research staff orientation training courses, applied research management&#13;
training, research management study tours for ARC members, and research reporting seminars. Computer&#13;
networking of the Agriculture Faculty, University of Zagreb, to international agriculture databases would&#13;
be provided, as would be subscriptions to journals and books. The four Zonal Research Extension&#13;
Coordination Units would be phased in during project implementation as the ARC becomes operational&#13;
and would be provided with office, computer, and training equipment.&#13;
AGRiCuLTuRAL RESEARCH CouNcEL (ARC)&#13;
78.   The project would establish the Agriculture Research Council (ARC) to organize, plan and&#13;
manage agricultural research on behalf of the MAF. The Council would be the focal point around which&#13;
the research investment revolves. This newly created body, chaired by a member appointed by the&#13;
Minister of Agriculture but having a majority of members selected by private farmers from among their&#13;
ranks, would be the decision making body identifying applied agricultural research that is needed and&#13;
selecting those research contracts to be funded.&#13;
79.   This Council would consist of fifteen members. Nine would be farmers with one from each of&#13;
the nine agriculture areas of Croatia. Farmer organizations would make these selections of members who&#13;
would serve fixed terms and who would be eligible to succeed themselves only once before moving off&#13;
the Council but with an opportunity of being re-elected again after a hiatus of at least one term. Initial&#13;
terms for a half or third of the farmers would be only half or one-third as long as a normal term so that&#13;
there would exist a relatively stable body of farmer members with only a half or a third susceptible to&#13;
change in any one year.&#13;
80.   Other elected members of the Council would be three representing the scientific-academic&#13;
community and selected from among active applied research scientists by MOST. These three members&#13;
would have staggered terms so that one would continue through each election. The final elected member&#13;
of the Council would be elected from the agricultural business community. The principal roles of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                          - 62 -                         Project Implementation Plan&#13;
four members would be to provide advice and guidance to the Council as pertains to scientific, technical&#13;
and business-industry feasibility of possible research and development thrusts to be considered, to help&#13;
select domestic and foreign technical reviewers for project proposals and as trainers in Croatia, and to&#13;
help identify possible international institutions where Croatians could be trained.&#13;
81.   Appointed members in addition to the chair appointed by MAF would be a representative from&#13;
the Ministry of Science and Technology and a representative from MAF appointed by its respective&#13;
minister. The latter would serve a critical role of helping the Council coordinate research and extension&#13;
activities at the national level while the representative from the Ministry of Science nd Technology would&#13;
help the Council coordinate academic and basic research funding by this Ministry with applied research&#13;
funding by the Council.&#13;
82.   The ARC will have a permanent full-time secretariat composed of an Executive Secretary who&#13;
would be a senior science administrator with demonstrated executive capabilities working full-time for&#13;
the Council. MAF would provide accommodation for the Secretariat. This secretariat would be&#13;
responsible for executing the day to day activities and special assignments by the Council. The functions&#13;
of the Secretariat would be to: (1) convene the Council; (2) produce the agendas; (3) receive project&#13;
proposals; (4) attend project evaluation sessions; (5) prepare the annual report.&#13;
83.   The Council will establish its own rules and procedures, set its own agenda, decide what research&#13;
thrusts would be advertised for proposals and select those proposals it deems most deserving and qualified&#13;
for funding. It would prescribe the format for research proposals. Finally, the Council would approve&#13;
persons to receive training domestically and abroad. MOST would: (1) screen and prepare shortlist of&#13;
proposals based on peer review for submission to the ARC; (2) process award of contracts; (3) provide&#13;
for the timely disbursement of funds; and (4) monitor expenditures against implementation schedule.&#13;
ZONAL RESEARCH EXTENSION COORDINATING UNrrs (ZRECU)&#13;
84.   One such unit would be created in each of the country's four agro-ecological zones and each&#13;
would have an advisory committee of one or three farmers from each Zupanija, depending on the number&#13;
of Zupanijas in the zone, and one person from the agri-business community. The farmers would serve&#13;
staggered terms and be selected by the respective Zupanija advisory committees in the zone and the agri-&#13;
business representative would be selected by the appropriate agri-business organization(s) in the zone.&#13;
The advisory committee would serve to advise the zonal units about research and extension needs and&#13;
may nominate the representatives from their respective zones to serve on the Agricultural Research&#13;
Council.&#13;
85.   Staffing of the units is seen as consisting of the coordinator and an agricultural economist-farm&#13;
manager. The two science professional persons would have training essentially equivalent to members&#13;
of faculties and research institutes. The responsibilities and duties of the zonal units would include:&#13;
(i) Coordinating research and demonstration activities in the zone.&#13;
(ii) Assuring that extension and research were closely associated and that research reflects&#13;
extension needs.&#13;
(iii) Coordinating extension and research thrusts.&#13;
(iv) Following-up on the performance of research projects in the zone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                      - 63 -                                        ANNEX A&#13;
(v) Sending suggestions for needed research to the Agricultural Research Council.&#13;
(vi) Holding field days at experimental and demonstration sites in the zone.&#13;
(vii) Assuring that all research and demonstration results were interpreted in simple language.&#13;
(viii) Providing for training and updating of Zupanija extension personnel.&#13;
(ix) Assisting Zupanija staffs with special problems needing study.&#13;
(x) Serving as technical back-up for Zupanija staffs.&#13;
(xi) Publishing or preparing for publication such materials that are of significant relevance in the&#13;
zone.&#13;
(xii) Maintaining close contact with several local media resources.&#13;
86.   In the absence of such zonal units, parts of the functions would have to be executed at the&#13;
Zupanija Extension Centers and part at the central level in Zagreb. Of necessity, some functions would&#13;
not be performed.&#13;
RESEARCH FUND&#13;
87.   Based on four-year costs estimates (including equipment needs) of four indicative broad areas of&#13;
research that had been identified as being potentially of highest priority (the actual research program&#13;
would be established by the ARC) a research fund in the amount of US$5.2 million would be made&#13;
available to the ARC (see table below).&#13;
88.   This amount is also estimated to be roughly in line with what could be mobilized through a future&#13;
possible levy collected from farmers applied to commodity sales of products passing through centrally&#13;
located collection / processing markets. Such a levy would be considered towards the end of project&#13;
implementation, once the new research system is established and has proven its value to the farming&#13;
community.&#13;
SUSTAINABLE FUNDING&#13;
89.   By the time this project ends, there will be, in place, a new system of effective research&#13;
management and an extension service made up of public specialists and private advisors. Croatia must&#13;
be ready to capitalize on the gains during the course of this project in order to maintain the pace of&#13;
transforming its agricultural industry.&#13;
90.   When this funding terminates, the major change in circumstances will be an end to this particular&#13;
source of funding through a loan from The World Bank and, perhaps, others. The rate of change will&#13;
be maintained only if all or at least a major part of the expiring funds can be replaced with domestic&#13;
support. There are a number of ways in which this might be done.&#13;
91.   First, MOST already is supporting a large number of faculty members and the facilities in which&#13;
they teach and do research and also funds some small amount of agricultural research. One possibility&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                                 - 64 -                            Project Implementation Plan&#13;
would be for MAF to allocate its own funds to continue the adaptive, applied and strategic research&#13;
started under this project.&#13;
92.    A second way would be for the government&#13;
to levy assessments against certain commodities that&#13;
are marketed in ways that would make assessments&#13;
easy to collect. Suggestions were made that these                  Relatio ships Zup jabb&#13;
commodities be milk, wheat, oilseeds and sugar                  to Agi   Z                   -nes&#13;
beets.  One or more of these are grown by most&#13;
farmers and the commodities goes through relatively                     upanIa name&#13;
few markets or processing channels.  This means                            . . . .. .. .&#13;
that all producers will pay  something  and the           Pannonian region&#13;

on 1993 total sales value would have a provided a total of US$ 2.0 million annually. If matched to an&#13;
equivalent by budgetary contribution, together they would adequately finance investment in agriculture&#13;
research.&#13;

is not fully exploited because of a shortage of research funds.&#13;
96.    A  reorientation  of research  staff&#13;
covering the new research structure, and&#13;
operational changes to accelerate the process of&#13;
changing attitudes and thought processes would           Agricultural Research Fund&#13;
be provided under the project.  Research                (Indicative 4 Year Program) I&#13;

97.    Ten candidates representing the major institutions would be provided with a study tour to visit&#13;
overseas research stations where these changes have been established. The candidates targeted for short&#13;
overseas training would be the younger mid-career scientists who would be leading the various sub-&#13;
projects and therefore require experience in a multidisciplinary approach to project implementation. Short&#13;
courses of two to three weeks, backed up with practical exposure in the field, would be provided for&#13;
twelve scientists.&#13;
98.    The project would also assist departments and individual scientists to develop interchange of ideas&#13;
through reciprocal visits to other countries where complementary research projects are being operated.&#13;
Initial priorities would be given to farming systems research, integrated plant protection, tillage and soil&#13;
management.&#13;
EQUIPMENT&#13;
99.    Equipment would be not be made available directly but only in the context of research contract&#13;
funded under the ARC. This would induce research proposals to minimize equipment cost and in&#13;
particular to try to find alternatives to the purchase of new equipment (e.g. sharing of equipment with&#13;
other national or international research facilities).&#13;
TECENCAL ASSISTANCE (TA)&#13;
100.   The Agriculture Research Council. The effective design and evaluation of the research program&#13;
relies heavily on the performance of the ARC. The concepts being introduced for project prioritization&#13;
and the radical changes to critically concentrate on national programs through a multidisciplinary&#13;
approach with strong economic evaluation inputs will need expert planning assistance, particularly in the&#13;
first year of operation. TA should be applied to assist in the introduction of the system, the review and&#13;
selection of the first-year projects and their supervision during the first years' growing season. A senior&#13;

B. RESEARCH COMPONENT COST&#13;
101.  Total Cost (including contingencies) are estimated at US$8.0 detailed cost breakdown is given&#13;
in Annex B, Table 2.2.&#13;
C. ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
DESIGN OF REQUESTS FOR PROPOSALS&#13;
102.  The following provides guidelines for the development of the operational procedures for the ARC&#13;
which wuld take place in late 1995 with Technical Assistance financed under a Japanese Grant in&#13;
collaboration between MAF and MOST.&#13;
103.  The universal experience is that scientists like to do research and take every opportunity to secure&#13;
funding for their research programs. Another observation is that scientists are willing to change their&#13;
research activities to accommodate the requirements of the funding sources or the sponsors. It also was&#13;
apparent that many faculty, research institutes and former "agro-kombinat" research specialists are&#13;
interested in doing applied research of immediate relevance to farmers. While no laboratory is ever&#13;
"fully equipped", and with the possible exception of the dislocated faculty at Osijek, agricultural scientists&#13;
in Croatia seem to feel their facilities are mostly adequate to undertake the private farmer focused&#13;
research needed. No doubt that greater international contacts in the future will reveal deficiencies that&#13;
the Agricultural Research Council should work to rectify.&#13;
104.  The large number of potential investigators who have had very little if no research funding from&#13;
the state in the recent past and the large range of topics this group of scientists could address, makes it&#13;
imperative that the topics for research be carefully identified and described. This will permit those&#13;
persons with skills to do the research required by the Agricultural Research Council to be able to identify&#13;
their interest with the need and submit proposals.  On the other hand it would not give false&#13;
encouragement to those excellent scientists who do not have the right training and interest to perform the&#13;
research needed. In short, a clearly stated request for research and extension proposals would avoid a&#13;
flood of proposals that are not relevant and would help assure that the submitted proposals are most likely&#13;
to meet the Council's requirements even though not all of them could be funded. Experience elsewhere&#13;
has shown that there will be requests for more funds than are available.&#13;
105.  Advisory Input: The structure of advisory councils at the Zupanija and zonal levels is focused&#13;
to provide the majority of members on the Agriculture Research Council, assure that they are identified&#13;
by the best available elective process and also assure they are private farmers. These advisory councils,&#13;
especially at the zonal levels, have a stated responsibility to propose the extension and research needs to&#13;
the Council. These facts and the desire to make the research relevant to farmer needs makes it of utmost&#13;
importance that the advisory system is used and listened to during the planning of research thrusts to be&#13;
supported each year.&#13;
106.  Once started, advisory input to the Council should be continuous and suggestions accepted and&#13;
kept on file until decisions are to be made on which will be pursued. Six weeks or two months before&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                     - 67 -                                       ANNEX A&#13;
decisions are to be made on research thrusts once or twice a year, a reminder should go to all Zupanija&#13;
and zonal offices that any additional suggestions should be submitted in order to be considered. Members&#13;
of the Council from the various zones should also talk about extension and research needs whenever they&#13;
meet with the Zonal Units and other farmers and they should bring suggestions they hear to Council&#13;
meetings.&#13;
107.  Administrative Determination: The Council will finally decide upon the fields in which it wishes&#13;
to request proposals for projects. Having done so, it should scrupulously follow its own requests relative&#13;
to proposals to consider. Even if a very good proposal that does not fit the criteria announced is received&#13;
it should be deferred. If a non-conforming proposal is a worthwhile idea, the Council may add it to the&#13;
next round of requests for proposals and perhaps receive even better proposals from among which to&#13;
choose.&#13;
108.  It is suggested that research awards be made twice a year because both fall sown and spring sown&#13;
crops are common and they represent entirely different species in most cases. The call for proposals&#13;
would make this clear in the announcement. In addition to permitting scientists better to utilize recently&#13;
collected data, the two awarding dates would spread the work load for the Council as well as its&#13;
secretariat. Making more frequent awards of funds might overwhelm a system that is just beginning to&#13;
function.&#13;
109.  Eligibility for Funding: Any bona fide Croatian research institute, public or private, would be&#13;
eligible to participate in this competitive grant research approach.&#13;
REsARCH AND/OR EXTENSION PROPOSALS&#13;
110.  In order to fulfill the close association of research with extension and to assure that research will&#13;
be relevant to private farms, all applied field work needs to be evaluated by a standardized procedure&#13;
even if different priorities are given to adaptive, applied and strategic research and demonstrations.&#13;
111.  Some funding agencies which expect large volumes of projects use a two-step process. The&#13;
first step is a preproposal and, as implied, is a short description of the project. Usually a length limit,&#13;
e.g., 2 pages or 3 pages of text is set plus, the budget sheet. These are quickly evaluated and those that&#13;
interest the sponsor would be developed into a full proposal in the form of the project outline discussed&#13;
above. Those of no further interest would be dropped from consideration.&#13;
112.  Evaluation: This procedure is done on both the preproposal and/or the full proposal. It would&#13;
be done for the Council by a panel of anonymous reviewers who do not have a direct relationship to the&#13;
project under the guidance of MOST.&#13;
113.  If these were preproposals, the Council would look carefully at the documents and evaluation and&#13;
identify those of greatest interest. It would then determine the cost of these based upon the budgets and&#13;
determine how many could be funded at the full levels, and if all proposals would still be as interesting&#13;
or if the order could be changed or budgets adjusted. Then a decision would be made on which scientists&#13;
would be asked to submit a full proposal.&#13;
114.  Funding: The final step is for the Council to decide which projects to fund, for how long and&#13;
at what level of funding, perhaps negotiating for lower expenses by reducing the project or other means.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                          - 68 -                        Project Implementation Plan&#13;
115.  Fairness and good morale both demand that reasonable research expenditures be made in all&#13;
regions. There are several ways to do this, but one way of allocating funds regionally can be described&#13;
in the request for proposals is based on a certain part of the total funds available divided equally among&#13;
the zones and the rest on the basis of a formula. For example, 25% could be allocated for good&#13;
proposals equally among the zones, and the balance allocated on the basis of number of private farms,&#13;
the rural population, gross agricultural product, hectares of arable land, etc., or a combination of two&#13;
or, no more than, three. So, as an example again, the remaining 75% of the funds could be allocated&#13;
equally based on number of private farms and hectares of cultivated crops. There should always be a&#13;
provision that if enough acceptable good proposals did not come from some zone, the unused funds would&#13;
be allocated among the others by the formula. The cost of the secretariat and the cost of Agricultural&#13;
Research Council activities would be taken out before allocation. New equipment or machinery needs&#13;
would be a part of the project proposals. New permanent facilities would be handled outside the ARC&#13;
funding process.&#13;
REPORTING AND DEFENSE&#13;
116.  A formal written report of progress must be required at least once a year for all funded projects.&#13;
This written report would be due a month or six weeks before new projects are considered for funding&#13;
and previously funded projects scheduled for extension for the second or subsequent years of their&#13;
planned terms. Oral reports would also be given at the time just prior to when new awards are to be&#13;
made. These two reports would give the Agricultural Research Council an opportunity to decide whether&#13;
the project has made progress enough to justify its continuation or whether it should be terminated&#13;
because it is not ever likely to succeed.&#13;
117.  If the Council decides to proceed with projects starting twice a year, then the report reading and&#13;
hearing tasks would be spread and the job of overseeing the results made easier. In case projects are&#13;
funded only once a year, the reporting could be made a month earlier so tentative decisions on continuing&#13;
projects could be out of the way before new projects are considered. If an outstanding new project&#13;
surfaces, the Council could still give it preference over a previously funded project that may be making&#13;
less than normal progress.&#13;
118.  In addition to Council members at the oral report meetings, the science professionals from the&#13;
Zonal Units should be present for the reports along with all the principal investigators making reports as&#13;
well as members of the technical review panels. It is important for the Zonal Unit coordinators to be&#13;
present so all can hear what has been achieved in the other three zones. The technical review panel&#13;
members will benefit because these reports will help them better to understand research problems and&#13;
perhaps make better evaluations for future proposals. They could also be used to help evaluate the&#13;
progress reported, in which case the would meet privately with the Council after the oral presentations.&#13;
These procedures are regularly used in progress evaluation. Again, the Council will have to conclude&#13;
its own evaluation because it is the final authority responsible for the research done with the funds&#13;
expended.&#13;
119.  One purpose of oral presentations is to allow questions to be asked from the audience so that the&#13;
investigators can defend their procedures, data collection, analysis of data and conclusions drawn. This&#13;
exercise will also be informative to Council members who will have to make more decisions about these&#13;
and other projects. It will enable them and the technical review panel members also to give advice or&#13;
suggestions on how to make the studies more meaningful and may also help them write better requests&#13;
for proposals.&#13;

ADAPTING TO EXTENSION USE&#13;
120.  Research results of applied studies will have no practical value until they are taken to farmers,&#13;
explained and farmers begin to adopt them. The information will need to be expressed in lay language&#13;
for farmers to study and understand. There are a number of ways in which information can be&#13;
disseminated. Some are listed as follows:&#13;
(i) Reports by the Agricultural Research Council of projects that are funded and where they will&#13;
be conducted.&#13;
(ii) Opportunities for farmers to view demonstrations and experiments during their development.&#13;
(iii) Local reports on radio, television, and newspaper reporting what is happening.&#13;
(iv) Reports of the results at the end of the season at the time the written report is due.&#13;
(v) News of demonstrations planned on the basis of what more complex experiments have shown.&#13;
(vi) Writing of pamphlets or bulletins for farmer use with the Zonal Unit science professionals and&#13;
research investigators cooperating.&#13;
(vii) Hold instructional meetings for farmers in each Zupanija.&#13;
(viii) Hold informational meetings for extension professionals and farm advisors in each zone.&#13;
121.  As always, scientists should be encouraged also to publish their work in scientific and technical&#13;
journals and bulletins. These publications would be a legitimate cost of doing research. While these&#13;
scientific papers might be slower in becoming published, the publications for extension use need to be&#13;
distributed as soon as possible by oral, visual or written means. The urgency of changing the nature of&#13;
agriculture in Croatia demands that information be released promptly and put into use as soon as it is&#13;
prudently possible.&#13;
MONITORING&#13;
122.  Component monitoring would be carried out by MAF's Department of Agriculture and of&#13;
Extension on the basis of the Performance Indicators outlined in Annex D.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                        - 70 -                        Project Implementation Plan&#13;
V. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION FOR ANIMAL&#13;
HEALTH SUPPORT SERVICES&#13;
A. DETAILED DESIGN FEATURES&#13;
123.  Current constraints with livestock disease control in Croatia, and to a lesser degree veterinary&#13;
epidemiology, are associated with outdated diagnostic equipment, inadequately trained staff, insufficient&#13;
resources for monitoring aspects of animal health and food quality particularly food residues, and&#13;
inefficient data management and information dissemination. Project investment would assist in providing&#13;
the basic resources to overcome these constraints and is focused on the government veterinary sector were&#13;
these services are expected to remain for the foreseeable future, due to the public goods nature of these&#13;
services.&#13;
124.  Summary. Animal Health would be improved through the strengthening of epidemiological&#13;
services leading to better disease identification and eradication programs. The National Veterinary&#13;
Institute (NVI) and its four regional branches would be provided with vehicles and a comprehensive range&#13;
of equipment to intensify the national disease surveillance program, a process which would be&#13;
complemented by strengthened border quarantine posts. NVI national and regional animal health data&#13;
bases would be linked to a strengthened MAF epidemiological service, and MAF's national disease&#13;
reporting service strengthened to support national disease eradication and international disease reporting&#13;
requirements. Private and public veterinarian technical and managerial skills would be improved through&#13;
local and overseas training. The National Veterinary Chamber would be strengthened. International&#13;
specialists would support the data management and veterinarian training programs.&#13;
125.  Detailed Features. Veterinary epidemiological services of the NVI would be reinforced by&#13;
provision of two national epidemiologist and two vehicles for field work, the development of a&#13;
epidemiological information service, establishment of a comprehensive Enzyme Linked Immuno-sorbent&#13;
Assay (ELISA)-based diagnostic service2 and through additional equipment to selected departments of&#13;
NVI, particularly the food residue detection laboratory (Table 1). Equipment would also be provided for&#13;
mastitis monitoring and blood, faecal and plant tissue analysis capability in support private veterinary&#13;
practices and farmers participating in a whole herd health program.&#13;
126.  The four regional diagnostic centers would be assisted with ELISA and other equipment to enable&#13;
them to support the national epidemiological service and regional whole herd health programs (Table 2).&#13;
Equipment would also be provided to the Poultry Institute in Zagreb to strengthen its support capacity&#13;
(Table 2). Overseas training programs, estimated at 18 person months, for staff at the NVI and regional&#13;
laboratories would address deficiencies in disease diagnostic capability and be linked to the supply of new&#13;
equipment and services.&#13;
2/ ELISA is an immunoassay test which is superseding more traditional disease identification tests,&#13;
particularly for infectious diseases. Its advantages include low cost, high speed, field applicability&#13;
and relatively high enzyme-labeled antibodies or anti-immunoglobulins, which attach themselves&#13;
respectively to the infective viral/bacterial antigens or antibodies (produced in response to disease&#13;
infection) in the sample. Color-coded "detectors" are subsequnetly added to provide visual evidence&#13;
of infection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                      - 71 -                                        ANNEX A&#13;
127.  Disease reporting and information management would be improved with the establishment of a&#13;
computer network linking MAF's Zupanije (i.e., district level) veterinary inspection services and MAF's&#13;
border control posts to NVI (Table 3). This would be first initiated in project Year 1, and expanded to&#13;
the full network in Year 2 after proving effectiveness. A standard word processing and database&#13;
management software package would also be provided with each unit. Technical assistance support of 5&#13;
person-months to design and test an integrated data base and familiarize staff with its use would also be&#13;
provided. Additional technical assistance would include two person-months for whole herd health&#13;
management and three person-months for veterinary epidemiology (2 visits).&#13;
128.  Six all terrain vehicles, one each to the NVI, the four regional institutes and the Poultry Institute,&#13;
would be provided for field investigation and sample transfer work. Each vehicle would be fitted with&#13;
a post-mortem kit, field microscope and transportable cold chain. Two liaison vehicles would also be&#13;
provided to NVI (Table 4).&#13;
129.  Each of the border control posts where veterinary inspection staff are based, would be supplied&#13;
with a computer system including a laser printer and modem for connection to a national network for the&#13;
transfer of disease reports and related epidemiological information. The project would provide 20 person&#13;
months (two weeks per staff member) of introductory training for Zupanije veterinary inspectors in&#13;
computer operation and the use of the custom-designed data management software package (see para 10).&#13;
130.  A project financed re-orientation training program (Table 5) would be designed to provide private&#13;
veterinary practices with the technical and management skills needed for efficient operation. In parallel&#13;
with the Zupanije program, one veterinary doctor per practice would be provided an introductory course&#13;
in computers and related office and data management (50 person-months). The project would contract the&#13;
Croatian Veterinary Faculty (working in collaboration with the Veterinary Chamber) to identify and&#13;
design a series of short courses for private veterinary practitioners on technical subjects including, though&#13;
not limited to, whole herd health and production management, fertility management, ruminant and non-&#13;
ruminant nutrition, artificial insemination, management-related disease, animal housing and welfare, small&#13;
animal work and ELISA technology. Course work would be structured to fit the work program of a&#13;
private veterinary practice by regional weekend or evening seminars and tutorials. Provision has been&#13;
made for the preparation on contract of 10 such courses, including all course teaching materials, at an&#13;
estimated cost of US$ 10,000 each. Participants would pay in advance a course fee to cover the recurrent&#13;
costs of the course including lecturers' salaries.&#13;
131.  The support provided to NVI and the regional institutes would not entail any additional staffing.&#13;
An estimate of additional recurrent costs to make full use of the equipment that would be supplied by the&#13;
project is US$ 250,000 per annum or 10 per cent of the investment cost. It is expected that these cost will&#13;
be largely recovered through inspection fees.&#13;
132.  This component would also provide short term support to Croatian animal health services by&#13;
assisting the fledgling Veterinary Chamber to provide technical, ethical and professional support to&#13;
veterinary doctors in Croatia, subject to the legal recognition of the Veterinary Chamber under the new&#13;
Veterinary Law. It is expected that a successful and efficient support organization for the veterinary&#13;
profession would attract the majority of qualified veterinary doctors who are presently not members and&#13;
would thus become even more effective in its support and regulatory functions.&#13;
133.  Support would include equipping the Chamber's office (furniture, photocopier, communications&#13;
equipment and computer hardware and software); the publication of a Croatian Veterinary Code; and the&#13;
cost of publishing 12 issues of a quarterly veterinary newsletter (Table 6).&#13;

B. ANIMAL HEALTH SUPPORT SERVICES COSTS&#13;
134.  The total cost (including contingencies) of the Animal Health Support Services Component is&#13;
estimated at US$6.1 million. A detailed cost breakdown is given in Annex B, Table 2.4.&#13;
C. BENEFTs AND BENEFIcIARES&#13;
135.  The expected benefits from this program are:&#13;
(i) an increased capacity of the regulatory veterinary services to diagnose and control the major&#13;
diseases of animal and public health importance;&#13;
(ii) a national, readily accessible data bank on disease distribution and occurrence to assist&#13;
Government in policy and planning work and to fulfil its obligations toward disease&#13;
reporting to the international community;&#13;
(iii) capability by the statutory veterinary institutes to analyze products of animal origin intended&#13;
for human consumption and use thus ensuring protection of public safety and health;&#13;
(iv) the capacity to monitor quality of exported food products thereby protecting the integrity of&#13;
existing markets and opening opportunity for new markets, particularly for "healthy" foods;&#13;
(v) an improved diagnostic and clinical service for farmers through the regulatory and private&#13;
veterinary services;&#13;
(vi) an effective professional and regulatory body for animal health matters; and&#13;
(vii) a body of veterinary doctors aware of and competent to carry out the professional services&#13;
required of them by the farming community.&#13;
136.  Beneficiaries will be the private farmers who will have access to enhanced cost-effective&#13;
veterinary services and thus improving the opportunity to earn greater profits. Government would also&#13;
benefit in having access to additional and more readily available animal health data on which to make&#13;
planning and policy decisions.&#13;
C. MANAGEMENT&#13;
137.  The Director, Veterinary Directorate, MAF, would have overall responsibility for the&#13;
implementation of the animal health sub-program. The Director would also be directly responsible for&#13;
the planning and implementation of the epidemiology program but would delegate responsibility for the&#13;
strengthening of the veterinary diagnostic services to the Director, National Veterinary Institute, who&#13;
would directly supervise the project activities at the NVI, the poultry institute and the four regional&#13;
diagnostic laboratories. The training modules to be produced for private veterinary practitioners would&#13;
be contracted to the Veterinary Faculty of Zagreb University which, supported by the Veterinary&#13;
Chamber in the prioritization of subject matter, would be assisted in their development by selected,&#13;
&#13;

internationally recruited technical advisors. The Croatian Veterinary Chamber would implement its own&#13;
development as financed by the project and would collaborate with the Veterinary Faculty in the&#13;
implementation of the private veterinary training program.&#13;
D. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
138.  The program would be executed over the four years of the project life. Laboratory equipment,&#13;
for NVI would be purchased in stages over three years while computers specifically for its use would be&#13;
made available in year one: one liaison vehicle and the 4-WD vehicle would also be made available in&#13;
year one. Laboratory equipment, computers and vehicles for the four regional institutes and the Poultry&#13;
Institute would be phased to equip two centers in year one, and three in year two. Computer equipment&#13;
to the Zupanije and border stations would first be pilot tested, then expanded to a full network in Year&#13;
3 assuming initial successful utilization of services provided.&#13;
139.  The main training and data base computer would be made available at the beginning of year one&#13;
and the data base program for epidemiology. Training of technicians, computer operators and private&#13;
veterinary practitioners would begin in year one and continue through the life of the project. Modules&#13;
for training of private veterinary practitioners would be prepared in a sequence of four modules in Year&#13;
one and three modules each in Years two and three of the project.&#13;
140.  Assistance to the Croatian Veterinary Chamber would be provided in year one.&#13;

Project Implementation Plan                    - 83 -                                     ANNEX A&#13;
VI. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION FOR&#13;
PASTURE AND FODDER DEVELOPMENT&#13;
A. OBJECTIVE&#13;
141.  The objective of the pasture program would be to reduce the cost of livestock production to&#13;
private farmers, to reduce reliance on expensive concentrate feeds and hence increase the competitiveness&#13;
of the livestock subsector by developing grassland production both on natural and sown pastures. Upland&#13;
areas would be made more productive through increased yields of natural grasslands and better&#13;
management. There would also be closer integration of livestock and crops in the agricultural systems&#13;
of the lowlands, leading to increased farm productivity.&#13;
B. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
142.  Pasture is among the most under-utilized resources in Croatia. Improved pasture and fodder&#13;
productivity, in terms of quality, quantity and seasonality of supply, could help reduce ruminant livestock&#13;
production costs and enable diversification of production. The enhancement of the upland grazing&#13;
industry could see the emergence of a pasture based upland cattle and sheep industry supplying weaned,&#13;
immature stock to lowland fatteners. Grassland-based livestock farmiing also offers the opportunity for&#13;
the entry into the industry of a much needed younger generation of farmers. Research into both&#13;
sustainable technology for incremental pasture production and the farming systems and sociological&#13;
settings where the technology is to be applied should help support the maintenance of the relatively&#13;
undisturbed environment that still pertains over much of Croatia. This would auger well for future niche&#13;
marketing of eco-friendly agricultural products amongst others, strengthened by project-based government&#13;
incentives in support of private market development initiatives.&#13;
143.  Pasture research in Croatia in the past has been directed to the development of sustainable,&#13;
livestock grazing-based production systems. Most pasture development has, however, focused on&#13;
uneconomic changes to the environment as the means of increasing perennial pasture productivity.&#13;
Expensive drainage and uneconomic liming and fertilization practices have made pasture improvement&#13;
uneconomic for private farmers. These policies have led to considerable government subsidy but only&#13;
limited pasture development.&#13;
144.  Government policy in the past has been unfavorable to the emergence of a pasture based livestock&#13;
industry and subsidies favored grain-based livestock feeding systems. A core scientific group continued&#13;
to investigate pasture production but its activities were severely curtailed by policy and funding&#13;
restrictions. The result has been limited progress in the development and particularly demonstration of&#13;
appropriate technology. However, with this small core scientific resource in place, opportunities for&#13;
technology transfer from similar environments and production systems in neighboring countries and with&#13;
its participation in a regional pasture research and development network, Croatia is well placed to&#13;
organize the rapid development of its pasture resource. The project would address the most immediate&#13;
of these constraints through investment in an applied, and more particularly adaptive, research program&#13;
closely linked to the work of the extension service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                        - 84 -                        Project Implementation Plan&#13;
145.  A re-oriented pasture development strategy would include: emphasis on species having low&#13;
fertilizer requirements and better adaptation to local agro-climatic conditions; modification only of the&#13;
micro-environment around the young plant; increased attention to marginal returns to incremental&#13;
fertilization; and management of the improved sward.  Exhaustive testing of alternative species,&#13;
particularly legumes, lime coating of inoculated seed, establishment of yield response curves to macro-&#13;
and micro-element (particularly molybdenum and sulphur on acid soils) and animal manure application,&#13;
increased supplies of single element fertilizer (particularly superphosphate), and improving and&#13;
maintaining pasture quality are key actions required to support a more cost-effective pasture development&#13;
strategy. With regard to pasture resource management, the establishment of land lease legislation, the&#13;
setting and policing of stock carrying capacity, and investment in low cost (electric) fencing would be pre-&#13;
requisites to effective management.&#13;
146.  The process of forage development must be supported by research. Some possible strategies&#13;
require further research before being available for commercial application but many are inmediately&#13;
implementable and could become the focus of a restructured extension service. The introduction of&#13;
wrapped silage as a means of fodder conservation by contractor service is also a promising avenue.&#13;
Plastic wrapped round-bale silage optimizes ensiling conditions and minimizes wastage were only small&#13;
daily quantities are needed. Another significant advantage offered by silage production is the capacity&#13;
to maintain production almost irrespective of weather conditions, thus allowing timely harvest particularly&#13;
with respect to fodder quality (digestibility and protein content).&#13;
147.  On-farm Technology Testing (OFTT) and field demonstration and the monitoring of management&#13;
systems adopted by leading farmers would be required to support the research program. Minimum tillage&#13;
is likely to play a big role in forage development through cost reductions and opportunities for relay&#13;
cropping resulting from more timely field operations. Unravelling the complexities of the practical&#13;
application of reduced-tillage farming systems would require tenacious research effort, and, as with the&#13;
pasture research program, much of it must be conducted on private farm holdings under practical&#13;
management conditions.&#13;
C. DETAILED DESIGN FEATURES&#13;
148.  The development of a grass-fed livestock industry would be supported through the implementation&#13;
of an applied and adaptive pasture development and research program, On-Farm Technology Testing&#13;
(OFTT), and demonstrations. The existing upland pasture research station at Sljeme 35 km from Zagreb&#13;
on Zagreb Mountain would be strengthened and research capability for lowland pasture and fodder crops&#13;
would be enhanced. Scientific staff skills would be strengthened, primarily through post-graduate&#13;
training, regional study tours and improved linkage with the FAO European Research Cooperative&#13;
Network on Pastures and Fodder Crops. Extension staff experience would be developed through&#13;
participation in the implementation of the OFTT and demonstration program, backed by in-service&#13;
training.&#13;
149.  The pasture development program would commence with a detailed assessment of the national&#13;
pasture resource by agro-ecological zone. The study would detail ownership, distribution and use patterns&#13;
of pastures, species mix and productivity, and agro-climatic and soil conditions. It would include the&#13;
preparation of a bibliography of published and unpublished scientific literature on pasture and fodder&#13;
production in Croatia. This part of the program would be implemented under contract by the Department&#13;
of Forage and Grassland Production of the Zagreb Faculty of Agriculture. When completed, the report&#13;
would form the basis for the development of a national strategy for the integration of pastures and forages&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                     - 85 -                                     ANNEX A&#13;
into livestock farming systems. Two person-weeks of technical assistance would be provided to support&#13;
this work. In addition, the expertise of a livestock/pasture economist would be provided to give the future&#13;
pasture and fodder development program a stronger economic focus.&#13;
150.  The project would support an applied and adaptive pasture and fodder research program, initially&#13;
in conditions relative to the mountain/upland agro-ecological zones. The research program would include&#13;
an OFTT program (where much of the field equipment listed in Table 1 would be deployed), implemented&#13;
in collaboration with the extension service and other regional research stations. The research program&#13;
would commence in Year 1 in the upland and continental areas, and Year 2 in the mediterranean area at&#13;
the Agricultural Research Institute at Split. The Institute would implement the adaptive research program&#13;
under the supervision of the Department of Forage and Grassland Production.&#13;
151.  The Zagreb University upland pasture research farm at Sljeme would be upgraded for use as a&#13;
training center in pasture management and livestock production. With only six scientists currently&#13;
actively working on pasture and fodder production, there is an urgent need to develop a cadre of younger&#13;
scientists to lead future research and development of this grossly under-utilized resource. The project&#13;
would finance three postgraduate programs in subjects including but not limited to species adaptation,&#13;
fertilizer response, fodder crop production, pasture/soil management, livestock production from pasture,&#13;
and pasture pests and disease. Students would receive external postgraduate training but would do&#13;
associated research work in Croatia. Supervisors of students would visit Croatia to support field research&#13;
work on a technical assistance (per diem and travel only) basis for a total of eight person-weeks.&#13;
Zupanije extension staff would receive training in pasture and fodder management and subsequently&#13;
participate in regular in-service training programs in pasture management. Pasture management extension&#13;
programs would be developed and promoted through Zupanija Extension Service Centers. Funds for on-&#13;
farm pasture management demonstrations would also be provided under the project.&#13;
152.  Finance would also be provided to strengthen the fodder corn and pasture legume breeding and&#13;
species adaptation work being conducted by the Agricultural Faculty of Zagreb University. Specifically&#13;
the project would finance a limited scope of field equipment to support an expanded variety trials&#13;
program, plot-scale seed processing equipment, one field vehicle, a desktop computer and the cost of&#13;
incremental laboratory services.&#13;
153.  The program would be closely linked to the work of the FAO European Research Cooperative&#13;
Network on Pastures and Fodder Crops (ERCNPFC). The project would provide funds for the active&#13;
participation of Croatian pasture and fodder scientists in ERCNPFC collaborative research programs and&#13;
associated international meetings.&#13;
154.  The support provided by the project to the University of Zagreb would not entail any additional&#13;
staffing. Additional recurrent costs to make full use of the equipment that would be supplied by the&#13;
project is estimated at US$24,000 per year for the laboratory equipment and US$12,000 for field work&#13;
elements or a total of US$36,000 per year.&#13;
D. PASTURE AND FORAGE PROGRAM COSTS&#13;
155.  The total cost (including contingencies) of the Pasture and Forage Development Prograin amounts&#13;
to US$2.3 million. A detailed cost breakdown is given in Annex D, Table 2.4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX A                                        - 86 -                       Project Implementation Plan&#13;
E. BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES&#13;
156.  The expected benefits from pasture and fodder development include:&#13;
(i) increased productivity and cost effectiveness of extensive sheep farming from low-cost&#13;
upland pasture improvement,&#13;
(ii) increased (possibly doubled) dry matter production of upland pastures to yield energy for&#13;
ruminants at about 20 per cent of the cost of concentrates and a potential to produce an&#13;
additional 0.4 million tonnes of milk or 0.1 million tonnes of beef;&#13;
(iii) high productivity at significantly reduced cost from conservation of high quality roughage&#13;
resulting in potential milk yields of 4,000-4,500 litres per lactation and live weight gains&#13;
of 1 kg per day on rations based on 60 per cent maize silage and 40 per cent leguminous&#13;
forage; and,&#13;
(iv) strengthened livestock-crop integration.&#13;
157.  The beneficiaries would be the farmers in both upland permanent grasslands and in lowland mixed&#13;
farms. It is expected that the low cost systems proposed would also favor young people entering into&#13;
agricultural production.&#13;
F. COMPONENT MANAGEMENT&#13;
158.  The pasture and fodder development program and the postgraduate training program would be&#13;
coordinated by the Department of Fodder and Grassland Production, Zagreb University, which would&#13;
take full responsibility for management of the applied research program in coordination with three&#13;
regional research institutions (Porice, Split and Osijek). The Department of Fodder and Grassland&#13;
Production would also be responsible for developing the technical specifications of the field and&#13;
laboratory equipment to be procured under the project (see Table 1).&#13;
159.  The OFTT and field demonstration program would be coordinated nationally by the Department&#13;
for Forage and Grassland Production. Zupanije Extension Service Centers would implement the&#13;
demonstration program in collaboration with interested farmers and use the trials and demonstrations as&#13;
a focal point for field days and farmer group visits. Technical advisors employed by livestock product&#13;
processors and input suppliers would be encouraged to participate actively in this program.&#13;
G. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
160.  The program would be implemented over four years. The grasslands inventory would be&#13;
completed and the report written up and the bibliography produced by the end of the first year of the&#13;
project.&#13;
161.  The civil works related to the new infrastructure and repair of the existing facilities of the Sljeme&#13;
Pasture Research Station would be initiated at the beginning of the first year of the project and be&#13;
completed and operational by end-year two.&#13;

162.  Training of extension workers would be spread evenly over the life of the project. The three&#13;
postgraduate studies would be awarded in first two project years.&#13;

VII. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION FOR SEED INDUSTRY&#13;
DEVELOPMENT&#13;
A. OBJECTIVE&#13;
163.  The objective of this component is to improve the regulatory and administrative framework of&#13;
the Croatian seed and plant genetic subsector, with a view to improving domestic plant genetic resources&#13;
and increasing the industry's export market access and competitiveness.&#13;
B. STRATEGIES&#13;
164.  To overcome identified constraints (see Annex L, Supplemental Volume) and to improve the&#13;
efficiency and credibility of the regulatory system as a whole, the project would (i) establish a unified&#13;
seed industry quality control authority, supported by an adequate analytical capability, regulatory&#13;
framework and enforcement capability; (ii) update and expand plant variety testing and registration&#13;
procedures; (iii) establish conditions enabling Croatian membership of international seed organizations&#13;
and (iv) re-establish the national gene bank.&#13;
C. DETAILED PROPOSALS&#13;
NATIONAL SEED AUTHORITY&#13;
165.  The project would establish the National Seed Authority (NSA) as an agency separate from but&#13;
answerable to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (see Figure 1). The purpose of the new Authority&#13;
would be to implement all regulatory and testing functions in plant agriculture as required under Croatian&#13;
law in an impartial manner and to report the results to the Minister of Agriculture. The Authority would&#13;
be supervised by a Board consisting of about 9 people, from academia, industry, and the MAF. The&#13;
Authority will combine, under a single management structure, the functions and staff and physical&#13;
resources of the MAF plant testing and border quarantine services, the Authority of Plant Protection, the&#13;
Viticulture Institute and parts of the MAF Forestry Department. The Authority is expected to employ&#13;
about 130 people, half of whom would be employed in border quarantine programs. While significant&#13;
staff savings are projected from the coalescence of these organizations, about 25 incremental staff will&#13;
be required to manage the VCU3 and DUS4 varietal testing program which will be moved from a&#13;
contracted to an Authority implemented program. The NSA would, in time, become entirely self&#13;
sustaining through service fees, as promulgated in the new draft Seed Law legislation. The NSA would&#13;
include, central laboratory, computing, statistical, research and financial and administrative services&#13;
supporting three Divisions, split on functional lines and responsible respectively for (1) Varietal Trials&#13;
(VCU and DUS Trials Services), (2) Plant Material Certification (Field Inspection, Quality Testing and&#13;
Certification Services), and (3) Plant Health (Border Quarantine, Integrated Pest Management and Agro-&#13;
chemical Registration Services). Detailed descriptions of the laboratory, office and field equipment&#13;
required to establish the NSA are contained part F (Field Trial Budget) of this chapter.&#13;
3/ Official varietal performance testing (Value for Cultivation and Use).&#13;
4/ Official varietal identification testing (Distinctness, Uniformity, Stability).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                           - 90 -                         Project Implementation Plan&#13;
166.  NSA Central Services. The laboratory staff and equipment of the Plant Protection Institute would&#13;
be transferred to the NSA and supported with additional equipment and one bacteriologist. Equally, the&#13;
NSA Statistical Services, Financial Services and Administrative Services Units would comprise staff&#13;
transferred from the Plant Protection Institute. The Research Unit would employ a single Research&#13;
Coordinator responsible for channeling spare scientific capacity within the NSA toward competitive&#13;
research contracts with the new Agricultural Research Council. The National Variety Listing Committee&#13;
would comprise appointed experts under (i) the Chair-personship of MAF's Deputy Minister for&#13;
Agriculture Production; (ii) with the Director NSA a permanent Committee member; and (iii) the&#13;
Director, MAF Agriculture Department, the Committee secretary. The Committee would meet on an "as&#13;
needs" basis.&#13;
167.  The Plant Testing Division, would evaluate varieties for inclusion in a restructured National List.&#13;
This would ensure that the National List gives farmer's an impartial assessment of those varieties which&#13;
are reasonable to grow. This is different and separate from extension trials and demonstration; the&#13;
purpose of the former is to give an estimate of the interaction between varieties. A variety would have&#13;
to be distinct, uniform, stable and have adequate performance before it can be placed on the national list.&#13;
The Division would consist of two Services with testing commencing with the agricultural crops and&#13;
introducing horticultural crops in year three or four. The responsibilities of the units would be:&#13;
(i)    Performance Testing Service (VCU, value for cultivation and use);&#13;
Variety Performance Trials. The objective of this Service would be to establish&#13;
repeatable high quality trials which adequately discriminate between varieties and are run&#13;
by unbiased, well qualified NSA staff. These would be carried out from three centers,&#13;
a main center (Zagreb), a sub-center (central east) and a Mediterranean sub-center in&#13;
Istria, the latter to be established once the two continental climate centers are operational.&#13;
Each center would manage a series of satellite stations. Each center would be staffed by&#13;
a qualified trials manager, a pathologist, 2-3 technicians and a tractor driver. Total staff&#13;
would not exceed 6 persons. Casual labor would be employed as required. Land would&#13;
be rented from farmers on an annual basis and trials laid out on each location. The trials&#13;
locations would be serviced from each center on a day to day basis. Species would be&#13;
grouped wherever possible and the travel distance kept to a minimum. This may require&#13;
some relocation of the currently used sites. Yield and agronomic data would be collected&#13;
in an organized and timely manner, from replicated trials following internationally&#13;
accepted designs, under the control of one person (the center manager). Field trial&#13;
protocols (reflecting local growing practices) would be written by the trials working&#13;
group for each species and the center manager would be responsible to ensure they are&#13;
carried out.&#13;
(ii)    Variety Identification Service (distinctness uniformity and stability, DUS);&#13;
Plant Variety Discrimination. This Service would carry out trials under UPOV5 guidelines&#13;
in such a manner as to allow the discrimination between varieties for Plant Variety Rights&#13;
purposes. This function would be new to the trials Authority. One field center would be&#13;
required for this morphological work6, provided irrigation was available and that a&#13;
sample was kept to allow replanting as required. One team of four people would be&#13;
established at the location (Zagreb) to do this work. As well as expert technician staff&#13;
5/ International Union for the Protection of New Plant Varieties.&#13;
6/ It is suggested that the internationally accepted guidelines are used wherever possible for variety discrimination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                          - 91 -                                           ANNEX A&#13;
they will also need access to good quality reliable casual labor. This unit would be&#13;
supported by the centralized NSA statistical and laboratory service groups. Introducing&#13;
the full range of species into this overall testing regime would require attention to detail,&#13;
careful timing and organization because: (i) the appropriate regulations would have to be&#13;
in place; (ii) a period of change-over would be required where both VCU systems (old&#13;
and new) are running in parallel; and (iii) the DUS system would be introduced for&#13;
several species and there is little or no experience of such work in the country.&#13;
168.   The introduction of Plant Variety Rights (PVR) would mean that a sample of the proposed seed&#13;
crop would need to be verified as authentic. It is proposed that when a variety is registered for seed&#13;
production that a sample (drawn by a licensed sampler) be sent to the Seed Testing Center. They would&#13;
grow it in small plots for detailed maturity and off-type analysis (thus avoiding the detail of checking&#13;
large fields) and control along with the DUS group the distinctness of the variety, initially by&#13;
morphological means but eventually with electrophoresis. UPOV proposes to allow the introduction of&#13;
electrophoresis as a diagnostic tool in 1995. It is proposed to introduce maize to the new system first,&#13;
because it is the crop from which the greatest genetic/agricultural improvement could be expected. This&#13;
would be followed by winter wheat the next year and the balance of the cereals and other miscellaneous&#13;
crops the year after. However, the spring planting season for maize was missed. This phasing is&#13;
important because it would be unlikely that the proposed change-over would occur without constraints.&#13;
An element of security would be achieved by running the old and new systems in parallel for a year. The&#13;
old system would then be progressively phased out as the new one is phased in. The overlapping year&#13;
serves two purposes (i) it ensures data is recorded from both systems (ii) it ensures a lot of data is&#13;
recorded, thus allowing a good estimate of variety value to be achieved to allow a significant rejection&#13;
of poor varieties from the National List.&#13;
169.   The reference collection, i.e. those varieties already on the national list, would need to be&#13;
established before any additional varieties are added, because, it is against these that all new variety&#13;
distinctness characteristics must be quantified for DUS purposes. The reason for this is that varieties&#13;
must be distinct before they receive PVR. Maintaining a large reference collection is expensive,&#13;
particularly so when many mediocre varieties are listed and not in everyday trade. The reduction in the&#13;
reference collection would be achieved by: (i) introducing a fee to keep varieties on the national list; (ii)&#13;
re-evaluating variety VCU and only listing the top 25 percent7.&#13;
170.   The Seed Certification Division, would be fully responsible for the monitoring of production&#13;
quality and health in the field and processing centers and for issuing of all plant material related&#13;
certificates. Quality control for the bulk of the harvested seed is presently checked by seed trade&#13;
laboratories, usually at their processing plants. This is a very satisfactory system and should be&#13;
maintained. Again, the NSA seed quality control laboratory (NSA central services) would be the final&#13;
arbiter on all questions of seed quality and health. This laboratory would train and license seed analysts&#13;
and monitor licensed seed trade laboratories. The Division would be totally responsible for controlling&#13;
the issue of licenses and the maintenance of standards. Individuals would pay to attend the training&#13;
courses and for the license, thus the training element should be self-financing. The Center would include&#13;
three Services&#13;
(i)    Field Inspection Service&#13;
State Inspectors would inspect all seed at elite and super elite levels growing under&#13;
breeder control. Private inspectors, licensed by the State, would inspect all commercial&#13;
7/ It is unlikely that a list of more than six varieties within any species and/or maturity group is of any real value for use in&#13;
Croatia. Specific varieties may require PVR for export purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                          - 92 -                        Project Implementation Plan&#13;
seed, unless it was for export, in which case a State inspector would be responsible. This&#13;
would mean that the seed trade, using licensed inspectors, would control the quality of&#13;
commercial seed. Because the quality of the starting seed would be much improved over&#13;
that which is available now, there should be fewer problems. The Service would arrange&#13;
the rotation for the day to day inspections thus avoiding people controlling their own&#13;
crops.&#13;
(ii)    Certification Service&#13;
All field, seed, plant and agro-chemical inspection reports would be sent to the Service&#13;
via a computer network only accessible by authorized personnel at each testing/data entry&#13;
point. If satisfied with test reports, the Division would give an inspection certificate, thus&#13;
allowing harvesting or sale of the relevant product. In the case of seed inspection, control&#13;
would be maintained by the Certification Division by only issuing licenses to people who&#13;
have satisfactorily attended specific NSA implemented training sessions for the&#13;
appropriate crops and who manifestly do a good job in the field. The use of random&#13;
inspections by the Field Inspection Service inspectors should adequately regulate the&#13;
system. Incompetent inspectors would lose their license.&#13;
(iii)   Plant Product Quality Service&#13;
The NSA Certification Division would also include a Plant Product Quality Service&#13;
responsible for testing plant products against specific standards and approving the&#13;
issuance of quality certificates. It is expected that NSA will register its own quality&#13;
certification label, the use of which would generate royalty income. However, this&#13;
Service will only be established in project year 3 and then only following the successful&#13;
establishment of the Field Inspection and the Certification Services and associated&#13;
computer network.&#13;
171.  The Plant Health Division, would be responsible for the management of the national Plant&#13;
Quarantine Service, a Integrated Pest Management Service and the Agro-chemical Registration Service.&#13;
(i)    Quarantine Service&#13;
This Service, already established under MAF management would be transferred to NSA&#13;
management in the second year of the project. No significant investment is proposed for&#13;
the relocated Service. Laboratory requirements would be met through the NSA central&#13;
laboratory where a bacteriologist would be added to already employed staff to provide&#13;
a comprehensive plant health analytical service.&#13;
(ii)   Integrated Pest Management (1PM) Service&#13;
Presently located within the Plant Protection Institute, the IPM service has been&#13;
marginalized in recent years. The project would finance two incremental staff and field&#13;
monitoring equipment to bolster farmer access to reliable pest risk information. The IPM&#13;
Service would initially focus on a few critical crop pests.&#13;
(iii)   Agro-chemical Registration Service&#13;
The existing agro-chemical registration service would be transferred to the NSA where&#13;
it would be supported by a more comprehensive laboratory service. Agro-chemical&#13;
registration requirements would be brought into line with European Union norms and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                           - 93 -                                            ANNEX A&#13;
certification process channeled through the NSA's "single window" Certification&#13;
Division.&#13;
172.   The NSA would join the International Seed Testing Authority (ISTA) as soon as possible. A fee8&#13;
would be charged for inspections made by the Certification Center personnel for super elite, elite and all&#13;
export seed. Samples checked by the NSA laboratory would also command a fee, unless they were part&#13;
of a random control procedure. Efforts must be made to improve the quality of seed production and to&#13;
teach quality control as a management input.&#13;
173.   In addition to establishing the NSA, the project would finance the following technical assistance&#13;
and training inputs in support of the establishment of the NSA and the development of new testing and&#13;
regulatory procedures.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
Position               Duration                      Responsibilities&#13;
Plant Variety Rights Specialist  three weeks    Review Croatian PVR regulations to ensure compliance&#13;

(2 visits)    NSA staff in their application; monitor results&#13;
174.   NSA staff will need to become more familiar with a range of new variety trials and seed testing&#13;
procedures introduced under the project. A series of short visits by NSA staff to selected European&#13;
centers is proposed. Staff training inputs are described in the following table.&#13;
8/ This is an annual fee, usually expressed as a proportion of seed production. Croatia would certainly be in the&#13;
lowest group, but what the actual amount would be is unknown.&#13;

D. COMPENENT COSTS&#13;
175.   The total cost (including contingencies) of the Seed Industry Development Program is estimated&#13;
at US$3.8 million. Detailed cost breakdown is presented in Annex B, Table 2.5.&#13;
E. BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES&#13;
176.   The major benefits from the reorganization of the plant industry regulatory and quality control&#13;
services would include:&#13;
(i)  rapid introduction of a range of modem varieties (protected by PVR) into&#13;
Croatian agriculture;&#13;
(ii)  the improvement of seed quality to the farmer, this would ultimately allow&#13;
a reduction of 20-30 percent in the sowing rate;&#13;
(iii) an increase in farm outputs. The program should add 10 percent to the&#13;
national production in maize;&#13;
(iv)  a reduction in seed prices through increased competition;&#13;
(v)  an improvement in the organization, administration and cost effectiveness of&#13;
the regulatory and quality control network, with consequent improved access&#13;
to export markets.&#13;
177.   The main beneficiaries would be:&#13;
(i)  farmer would benefit the most through improved income from reduced seed use&#13;
and higher yielding, more efficient varieties;&#13;
&#13;

(ii) MAF, as seed testing and quarantine would be removed from their direct&#13;
responsibility.&#13;
(iii) companies producing seeds and plant genetic materials which would have a higher&#13;
quality product to market domestically and more assured access to international&#13;
markets.&#13;
F. TRIAL BUDGET ESTIMATES&#13;
178.   The restructured variety trials program  would establish a system  which will allow  the&#13;
discriminative evaluation of varieties submitted for official testing, to establish and control their plant&#13;
variety rights, and register approved varieties on the national list as required. Species groups will require&#13;
specific machinery for either sowing or harvesting. It is anticipated that the sugar beet and potato trials&#13;
will be harvested by hand, with potato also hand planted.&#13;

179.  It has been assumed that on average each variety is at an average of 4 locations (2 centers x 2&#13;
satellites) with the FAO 400 and FAO 500 maize varieties are at six locations that each variety x location&#13;
has 5 replications. Assuming about 600 varieties on trial in the project period, this will require about&#13;
10,000 plots or about 3,500 plots per center. With an average plot size of 7 sq.m. (based on 6m centers),&#13;
the land required at each center for trials will be 2.5 ha. Allowance for borders, discards and roadways&#13;

ANNEX A                                          - 96 -                        Project Irplementation Plan&#13;
would add 50%, making a total land requirement by each center of 4.0 ha. An additional one hectare&#13;
would be required at one center for DUS and seed production plots.&#13;
180.  It is proposed that initially, land is rented from farmers on an annual basis but in a prepared state,&#13;
ready for drilling, and given back to farmers immediately after harvest. The centers will require about&#13;
11 hectares at about 800 Kuna (US$160) per hectare per year.&#13;
VAUUETY TRiALS BUILDINGS&#13;
181.  The NSA headquarters would need a range of buildings preferably in one location sufficient to&#13;
install laboratories, machinery store, seed handling unit, dryer and administration. total area is estimated&#13;
at about 900 in2.&#13;

Vm. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION&#13;
FOR POLICY ANALYSIS UNIT&#13;
187.  Parliament's adoption of the Government's "Agricultural Policy Strategy" has paved the way for&#13;
widespread policy reform over the next 2-3 years. The MAF's capacity for policy analysis and policy&#13;
formation is rather limited however, consisting of a unit of two people which reports to the Deputy&#13;
Minister, Agriculture Policy. Neither of these people are well-trained in the techniques of policy&#13;
analysis.&#13;
188.  Recognizing this deficiency, the MAF has now received permission to increase this unit to 4-5&#13;
people and has the project support which would establish an effective Agriculture Policy Analysis Unit.&#13;
The proposed role, structure and organization of this Agriculture Policy Analysis Unit (APAU) are&#13;
outlined below, together with a description of the technical assistance requested from the Project. This&#13;
technical assistance has been designed to meet both the immediate needs of MAF to develop the policies&#13;
needed to implement the Agricultural Policy Strategy, and the more fundamental long-term need to&#13;
establish a strong national policy capacity for policy analysis.&#13;
A. ROLE FOR THE MAF POLICY UNIT&#13;
189.  Price and trade policy is viewed as the most appropriate focus of the Policy Unit. As the Croatian&#13;
economy becomes more open and market-oriented, a strong capacity for price and trade policy analysis&#13;
would become increasingly important in order to provide effective advice on:&#13;
-  the implications of policy change for Croatian farmers, processors and  consumers of&#13;
agricultural products.&#13;
- the form which current and future price and trade policies should take&#13;
190.  To fulfill this general mandate, MAF would establish a APAU which reports to the Deputy&#13;
Minister responsible for economic policy. Working together with the Minister and Deputy-Ministers of&#13;
Agriculture, and national and international experts, the specific responsibilities of the APAU would be&#13;
to:&#13;
- Provide advice on the price and trade policy measures required to implement the agricultural&#13;
strategy, and the timing of any policy changes.&#13;
- Assist in the preparation, negotiation and re-negotiation of trade agreements which effect the&#13;
agricultural sector.&#13;
- Monitor trends in domestic and international markets for those agricultural inputs and outputs&#13;
relevant to Croatian agriculture, and advise the MAF on the implications of these trends for&#13;
agricultural production and trade.&#13;
- Monitor trends in domestic agricultural production and agro-processing and advise the MAF&#13;
on the implications of these trends for agricultural production and trade.&#13;
-  Monitor trends in those macroeconomic conditions which influence production, processing,&#13;
prices and trade (inflation, exchange rates, interest rates, economic growth etc)&#13;
- Monitor proposed policy changes in other sectors of the economy and advise the MAF on the&#13;
implications of these policies for agricultural production and trade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

-  Maintain effective links with the agricultural research community and the Agricultural&#13;
Research Council.&#13;
B. STRUCTURE OF THE POLICY UNIT&#13;
191.  The unit would comprise 4-5 people working under a unit head, who would report to the Deputy&#13;
Minister responsible for economic policy. In addition to the head person, the unit would require three-&#13;
four specialists to work in the following subject areas:&#13;
- International Trade and Prices&#13;
- Farm Management and Farm Surveys&#13;
-  Domestic Marketing, Consumption and Agro-Processing&#13;
-  Information Acquisition, Management and Dissemination; and Administrative Support.&#13;
192.  In addition to their specific responsibilities, all the staff of the Policy Unit would need to be&#13;
computer literate, particularly with word-processing and the use of spread-sheets, and have the ability and&#13;
the desire to learn new approaches to economic analysis quickly.&#13;
C. JOB DESCRIPTIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS OF POLICY UNIT STAFF&#13;
Policy Unit Head&#13;
193.  The Policy Unit Head would have overall responsibility for using resources within the unit to&#13;
review the implications of current and future policies relevant to the agricultural sector, and advising the&#13;

D. STAFF TRAINING&#13;
204.  Each of the 4-5 staff members would receive up to three months training outside Croatia, in their&#13;
field of specialization. In order to complete this training as early as possible, relevant training programs&#13;
would be identified as soon as the Project starts. The objective would be to train two specialists in the&#13;
first year of the Project and the remaining two-three staff members during the following eighteen months.&#13;
Potential training programs include those offered by the Economic Development Institute, World Bank&#13;
(USA); the Harvard Institute of International Development, Harvard University (USA); and Wye College,&#13;
England. In the course of normal work for the Policy Unit additional experience should also be sought&#13;
from attendance at policy seminars and visits to international organizations, within and outside Croatia.&#13;
205.  Staff would also receive on-the-job training from the Technical Assistance expert assigned to the&#13;
Project. This would include guidance on the choice and application of analytical techniques, supported&#13;
where necessary by the acquisition of suitable text-books (with project funds).&#13;
E. PHASED ESTABLISHMENT OF THE POLICY UNIT&#13;
206.  Initial priority should be given to recruitment of the specialists in International Trade and Prices,&#13;
and Marketing and Consumption. These specialists would provide the support needed to address the&#13;
immediate needs for trade and price policy issues and the probable investment in market infrastructure.&#13;
207.  To ensure that all aspects of agricultural policy are addressed by the APAU, any initial work on&#13;
farm management analysis and farm surveys would be contracted out to the Institute of Agriculture.&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
(i)    LONG-TERM POLICY ADVISER&#13;
208.  To support the establishment and initial operation of the Policy Unit a consultant would be&#13;

project. The consultant would work as a Policy Adviser at the level of Specialist and report to the Deputy&#13;
Minister responsible for Economic Policy.&#13;
209.  While the consultant would be expected to provide immediate technical input into all relevant&#13;
areas of policy analysis, his or her overall responsibility would be to develop the capacity of Croatian&#13;
staff to fulfill the role and functions of the Policy Unit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

qualification required, and expected output) for the three activities under this assignment: (i) short term&#13;
price and trade specialist; (ii) market information system development; and (iii) farm surveys.&#13;
F. AGRICULTURE PRICE AND TRADE SPECLILIST&#13;
217.  Background. As the Croatian economy becomes more open and market-oriented, price and trade&#13;
policy will become increasingly important. A strong capacity for price and trade analysis is thus essential&#13;
in order to provide effective advice on:&#13;
- the implications of policy change for Croatian farmers and processors and Croatian consumers&#13;
of agricultural products; and&#13;
- the form which current and future price and trade policies should take.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                          -110 -                         Project Implementation Plan&#13;
218.  To fulfill this general mandate the MAF proposes to establish an Agriculture Policy Unit which&#13;
reports to the Deputy Minister of Agriculture responsible for economic policy. Working together with&#13;
the Minister and Deputy-Ministers of Agriculture, and national and experts, the specific responsibilities&#13;
of this Policy Unit would be to:&#13;
- Provide advice on the price and trade policy measures required to implement MAF's&#13;
Agricultural Policy Strategy, and the timing of any policy changes.&#13;
- Assist in the preparation, negotiation and re-negotiation of trade agreement effect the&#13;
agricultural sector.&#13;
- Monitor trends in domestic and international markets for those agriculture inputs and outputs&#13;
relevant to Croatian agriculture, and advise the MAF on the implication of these trends for&#13;
agricultural production and trade.&#13;
- Monitor trends in domestic agricultural production and agro-processing and advice the MAF&#13;
on the implications of these trends for agricultural production.&#13;
- Monitor trends in macroeconomic conditions which influence production, processing, prices&#13;
and trade (inflation, exchange rates, interest rates, economic growth);&#13;
- Monitor proposed policy changes in other sectors of the economy and advise MAF on the&#13;
implications of these policies for agricultural production and trade.&#13;
219.    Assignent. As it will take some time to staff and equip the Policy Unit, more immediate&#13;
technical assistance is needed to begin the policy reforms specified in MAF's Agriculture Policy Strategy.&#13;
Among the most pressing of these reforms are those associated with trade and price policy as a result of&#13;
pending membership of the World Trade Organization and the proposed rationalization of import&#13;
protection and price support. Rapid, well-conceived policy initiatives in these areas will also do much to&#13;
sustain the widespread initial support for the Agriculture Policy Strategy and to assist in the restructuring&#13;
of MAF's Agriculture Policy Unit.&#13;
220.  To support the analysis, choice and design of these reforms, and the concurrent negotiation and&#13;
re-negotiation of major trade agreements, a consultant will be employed as soon as possible for a period&#13;
of about two months to provide expertise on a short-term basis. The consultant will work in the current&#13;
Policy Department in the MAF and report to the Deputy Minister responsible for Economic Policy. The&#13;
MAF will provide the consultant with an office, computer facilities, and full logistical support.&#13;
221.  Responsibilities and Output. (i) To advise the Deputy Minister on all aspects of price and trade&#13;
policy, with emphasis on the impact of membership to the World Trade Organization, rationalization of&#13;
import protection and price support, and the negotiation of major trade agreements. (ii) To prepare short&#13;
written reports on all analyses undertaken in this regard for future reference by Policy Unit Staff. These&#13;
reports should describe the issue analyzed, the methodology applied, and any assumptions used; followed&#13;
by discussion of the recommendation&#13;
222.  Qualifications: Post-graduate qualification in Agricultural Economics or Economics (minimum&#13;
Master Level) with at least ten years of relevant work experience in the analysis of price and trade. A&#13;
sound knowledge of the World Trade Organization and the technical aspects of the Uruguay Round&#13;
Agreement; the trade implications of the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union; and an&#13;
understanding of the process of negotiating trade agreements. An understanding of the problems faced&#13;
by economies in transition, preferably in eastern and central Europe. A sound grasp of the principles and&#13;
techniques of economic analysis and the ability to apply these skills to the analysis of price and trade&#13;
policy and to communicate the associated methodology and results.&#13;

G. MARKET INFORMATION SYSTEM&#13;
223.  Background. Full access to information is an essential pre-requisite for an efficient, agricultural&#13;
sector, especially if family farms are to benefit from the opportunities created by well-functioning&#13;
markets. With this in mind, a market information system (MIS) is to be established within MAF's APAU.&#13;
The objective is to collect information at approximately ten produce markets throughout Croatia on a&#13;
daily basis which would be transmitted to Zagreb by computer for collation and then disseminated through&#13;
daily radio broadcasts.&#13;
224.  A series of short-term technical inputs would be required to establish the MIS and to review its&#13;
initial performance. These inputs would be provided by a Market Information Specialist and a&#13;
Communications Specialist who would be employed for 7 weeks and 2 weeks respectively over a total&#13;
elapsed time of approximately 5 months. Their respective activities and responsibilities are specified&#13;
below.&#13;
225.   The technical assistance would involve an initial visit by the market information specialist and&#13;
the communication specialists to design the system, arrange the radio broadcasts, and define the technical&#13;
specifications of the equipment. Once the hardware and software have been obtained during early project&#13;
implementation, the communications specialist would return to install it and check that it was operating&#13;
correctly. The market information specialist would then train the enumerators responsible for data&#13;
collection and MAF's market policy analyst responsible for data collation, and ensure that they were able&#13;
to operate the equipment. Three months after the system has been in operation the market information&#13;
specialist would return for a further two weeks to review the system and assess the need and nature of&#13;
any improvements.&#13;
226.  Detailed Assignments for the Market Information Specialist and the Communications Specialist&#13;
A. System Design&#13;

Information officer&#13;
- Develop methodology for data collection&#13;
-  Establish a format for collating and summarizing the data at the Policy Unit&#13;
- Initiate recruitment of enumerators (desired qualifications, amount of work required etc)&#13;
- Determine optimal broadcasting procedures&#13;
Time Required: 1 month for the Market Information Specialist, two weeks for the&#13;
Communications Specialist.&#13;
Output:       The output of the design stage would consist in a systematic operational&#13;
handbook, discussed and agreed upon with MAF covering all procedural aspects&#13;
of the market information system, and including technical specifications of the&#13;
hard and software to be procured under the project.&#13;
&#13;

related fields and at least ten years relevant experience in market intelligence.&#13;
Communications Specialist: technical expert in data transfer and processing technology with at&#13;
least ten years relevant experience.&#13;
H. FARM MONITORING SURVEYS&#13;
228.  Background. Prior to independence the collection of agricultural statistics was oriented towards&#13;
production on ex-social sector farms. The consequent lack of information on private farms has become&#13;
a serious constraint to policy analysis, especially following the adoption of a new Agricultural Policy&#13;
Strategy which emphasizes the role of family farms. It is difficult to respond effectively to the needs of&#13;
Croatia's small-scale family farms when so little is known about the constraints they face and implications&#13;
of policy change for their well-being. To address this problem the project would initiate and fund two&#13;
related surveys, each of which covers both full and part-time small-scale family farms. The first would&#13;
be a comprehensive baseline survey to provide up-to-date information on factors such demographic&#13;
characteristics, the farm resource base, cropping patterns and livestock holdings, levels of production and&#13;
marketed surplus, the level and composition of farm income and expenditure, and the contribution of&#13;
non-farm income to total household income. It would also include behavioral and attitudinal variables.&#13;
A smaller, second survey would then be initiated as the basis for an annual monitoring of the status of&#13;
and the changes on family farms. This second survey would be of a size (in terms of both numbers and&#13;
data collected) which allows rapid data collection, processing and analysis. The two surveys would be&#13;
designed together to ensure that they complement each other as much as possible.&#13;
229.  Technical assistance for these surveys would consist of an agriculture statistician and a farm&#13;
management survey specialist. Particular emphasis would be placed on involving members of the MAF,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                      - 113 -                                       ANNEX A&#13;
the Institute of Agriculture Economics and family farmer representatives in the initial design of the two&#13;
surveys. To ensure that the information generated informs policy decisions in a timely manner, careful&#13;
attention should also be given to procedures which allow quick and effective data processing. Such&#13;
timeliness will be especially important for the smaller annual monitoring surveys.&#13;
230.  The duties and responsibilities of the respective consultants are outlined below. An input of two&#13;
weeks is envisaged for the agricultural statistician and six weeks for the farm management survey&#13;
specialist. The MAF would provide office space and logistical support to each consultant.&#13;
231.  Output of the overall assignment: The output of the study would consist in a systematic&#13;
operational handbook, discussed and agreed upon with MAF covering all procedural aspects of the&#13;
baseline and the on-farm monitoring system.&#13;
232.  Agriculture Statistician&#13;
Responsibilities:&#13;
- together with the Croatian Bureau of Statistics, review the national sampling framework and&#13;
develop recommendations on optimal sampling procedures and sample sizes for both the baseline&#13;
survey and the annual monitoring surveys.&#13;
- review the current definitions of full and part-time farmers used in the national sampling&#13;
framework. Decide on their relevance to the two surveys and recommend alternative definitions&#13;
where appropriate, plus measures to modify the sampling framework accordingly.&#13;
- for the monitoring survey review the implications of taking a new sample each year or&#13;
retaining a fixed sample and re-weighing it each year to reflect changes in the underlying&#13;
population. Describe the sampling techniques to be used in the event that a new sample is taken&#13;
each year, and the basis for re-weighing the sample in the event that a fixed sample is considered&#13;
optimal.&#13;
- prepare a report of not more than twenty pages which describes the national sampling&#13;
framework, its suitability as the basis for the proposed farm surveys, the definitions of full a part-&#13;
time farmers, and the sampling procedures and sample sizes considered optimal for each of the&#13;
two surveys. Include the description and discussion of the alternative sampling strategies for the&#13;
monitoring surveys.&#13;
Time allowed for the study and report writing, two weeks.&#13;
Qualifications: Advanced degree in agricultural statistics or statistics (minimum Masters Level),&#13;
with at least ten years experience in the statistical design of both large and small-scale surveys&#13;
of small farmers.&#13;

233.  Farm Management Survev Specialist&#13;
Responsibilities:&#13;
- together with staff of the MAD, Institute of Agriculture Economies and small-farner&#13;
representatives, determine the principle issues which information from the Baseline and&#13;
Monitoring surveys should seek to illuminate.&#13;
- based on these issues, develop and test the questionnaires for both surveys, to collect both&#13;
quantitative and qualitative infornation (attitudes, perceptions of constraints and opportunities&#13;
etc). Ensure that the two sets of questionnaires generate data which are consistent and can be&#13;
used in a complementary manner.&#13;
- for the monitoring survey questionnaire, ensure that one element of the data set is quantitative&#13;
and constant, to provide a consistent source of time-series data; and another more flexible module&#13;
collects on issues of current importance. (for example the use of a permanent module on factors&#13;
such as resource use, cropping patterns and livestock holdings, production levels and marketed&#13;
surplus; plus a qualitative module which varies from year to year in response to particular issues&#13;
of importance).&#13;
- determine the most appropriate definitions of full and part-time farmers based on the report by&#13;
the agricultural statistician and discussions with Croatian collaborators.&#13;
- based on the sampling strategies recommended by the agricultural statistician, develop a cost-&#13;
effective strategy for sample selection for each survey, which facilitates accurate, efficient&#13;
collection. include consideration of interviews, mail surveys, and the payment of farmers to keep&#13;
their won records and complete their own questionnaires.&#13;
- develop data entry and verification routines in association with questionnaire design, to sure that&#13;
the data are entered and checked in a timely manner; and make realistic estimates of the time and&#13;
resources required to transform the raw data into a form useful for analysis.&#13;
- advise on the most appropriate basis for analysis of the data from each survey, and prepare an&#13;
outline report (including dummy tables), to guide final analysis and ensure that the results&#13;
illuminate the issues originally defined.&#13;
- for each survey prepare a realistic timetable for survey implantation and data processing and&#13;
analysis.&#13;
- prepare a report which summarizes the issues to be addressed by the two surveys, the sampling&#13;
strategies and data collection and processing techniques to be used, the implementation timetables,&#13;
and the outline of the analysis. Time required to complete the study, including report writing: six&#13;
weeks.&#13;
Qualifications: (i) Advanced degree in agriculture economics (minimum Master level) with a&#13;
specialization in farm management, and (ii) at least ten years experience in the design,&#13;
implementation and analysis of farm management surveys. (iii) An understanding of the problems&#13;
faced by economies in transition, preferably in eastern and central Europe.&#13;

ANNEX C&#13;
PROJECT PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
1.        Project procurement arrangements are summarized in the Table C. 1 below and will be&#13;
undertaken in the following manner:&#13;
(i) Procurement of goods. The purchase of vehicles; computers; seed, grassland, and&#13;
veterinary laboratory equipment (excluding applied research related equipment; see&#13;
below, Procurement of Research Services); specialized farming equipment (for seed and&#13;
pasture variety trials); and milk and meat quality testing equipment would be carried&#13;
out through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (January&#13;
1995). Contracts for goods estimated to cost US$300,000 or above would be procured&#13;
through ICB. Goods procured through ICB would constitute about 90 percent of cost&#13;
of Loan-financed goods. In the evaluation and comparison of bids for equipment to be&#13;
procured through ICB, Croatian manufactures would receive a domestic preference in&#13;
bid evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price or the prevailing customs duty, whichever&#13;
is less, provided that a bidder offering goods manufactured in Croatia establishes to the&#13;
satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank that (i) labor, raw materials and components&#13;
from within Croatia will account for more than 30 percent of the Ex-Works price of&#13;
the product offered; and (ii) the production facility in which those goods will be&#13;
manufactured or assembled has been engaged in manufacturing / assembling such goods&#13;
at least since the time of bid submission.&#13;
(ii)   The remaining 10 percent of Loan funded goods would be in minor packages suitable&#13;
for procurement methods other than ICB as follows:&#13;
(a)  National Competitive Bidding (NCB) for office furniture: two contracts&#13;
(financing amounting to approximately US$470,000) would be concluded using&#13;
Bank's NCB bidding documents for goods; there are numerous national&#13;
manufactures and traders of office furniture in Croatia ensuring competition in&#13;
the provision of these goods; also the size and the nature of the contracts is not&#13;
likely to generate foreign interest in bidding;&#13;
(b)  contracts for goods estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per contract (financing&#13;
amounting to US$280,000 in the aggregate), including audio-visual equipment,&#13;
small-scale irrigation equipment, herd performance recording equipment, and off-&#13;
the-shelf items such as office and training supplies, may be purchased through&#13;
National Shopping (NS), obtaining price quotations from at least three qualified&#13;
local suppliers; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Direct purchasing (aggregate amount financed US$0.340 milUon) of specialized research and extension publications and&#13;
journals (ranging from US$20 - 250).&#13;
National shopping (aggregate amount financed US$0.37 millon) for the publication of a farm management handbook; a&#13;
veterinary journal; and extension mass media packages (some 30 contracts up to US$30,000).&#13;
(g) Competitive Grant Research: (aggregate amountfinanced US$4.2 milion) for appUed agriculture research contracts awarded&#13;
to national qualfied research organizations based on research TORs established by ARC, research proposals submitted by&#13;
research organizations, evaluations carried out by independent research review panel (some 50 research contracts ranging&#13;
from US$50,000 to 150,000).&#13;

Project Implementation Plan                      - 129 -                                        ANNEX C&#13;
(iii) Procurement of works. Two civil works contracts would be carried out, consisting (i) of the&#13;
rehabilitation of the Sljeme Pasture Research Station, and the construction of the Pasture&#13;
Laboratory and Training Facility at said station; and (ii) the installation of a small seed bank at&#13;
the Faculty of Agronomy, University of Zagreb. The first contract (i.e., construction and&#13;
rehabilitation of Sljeme Pasture Research Station, estimated to cost US$904,000 (financing&#13;
US$796,000), would be procured following National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures in&#13;
accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines. The issue of prequalifications would be discussed&#13;
at negotiations. The second civil works contract (i.e., installation of a gene bank), estimated to&#13;
cost US$56,000 (financing US$49,000), would be done following National Shopping procedures&#13;
for small works based on price quotations from at least three local qualified contractors. The local&#13;
construction industry is qualified to carry out such relatively simple civil works; also, it has been&#13;
established that sufficient competition exists amongst the local suppliers of civil works. Given the&#13;
remote location of the Sljeme Pasture Research Station, and the small value of the second&#13;
contract, it would not be likely to attract foreign bidders. A Country Procurement Assessment&#13;
Review (CPAR) for Croatia will be done following the passage by Parliament of its Public&#13;
Procurement Law. The CPAR is tentatively scheduled for early 1996. Meanwhile, the Bank's&#13;
NCB bidding documents for works will be used for the above -mentioned NCB contract.&#13;
(iv) Procurement of consulting services. Consultants for specialized and professional services financed&#13;
under the project would be selected in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants&#13;
by World Bank Borrowers and by the Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). These services&#13;
will be procured on the basis of shortlisting of qualified well-known firms, both international and&#13;
local. With the exception of a long term agriculture policy specialists, all individual consultancy&#13;
assignments are of a short term nature (between one to three months) and many include the&#13;
development of training programs and curricula.&#13;
2.        Specialized services would include six consulting contracts (estimated total cost US$1.84&#13;
million) for each of the project components. Each contract to be executed by international and national&#13;
consultants would include the following specialized services:&#13;
(i) extension: extension specialists, and skills training specialist;&#13;
(ii) research: applied research management specialist, applied research training specialist,&#13;
specialized agriculture research advisors;&#13;
(iii) animal health: veterinary epidemiologist, epidemiology data base specialist, whole herd&#13;
health advisor, computer programmer;&#13;
(iv)  grassland development: pasture resource inventory specialist, pasture/livestock economist,&#13;
grassland management specialist, pasture-based ruminant nutrition specialist;&#13;
(v)  seed industry development: seed certification specialist, seed industry regulations&#13;
specialist, seed testing and trials specialists; and&#13;
(vi)  policy analysis support: agriculture policy specialist, trade analyst, subsector policy&#13;
specialists and policy studies; and farm monitoring and market information activities.&#13;
3.        Included under item  (vi) para. 2 above (policy analysis support) but under separate&#13;
procurement arrangements are farm monitoring activities (aggregate finance US$100,000) and the&#13;
implementation of a market information system (aggregate finance US$100,000). Farm monitoring&#13;
activities including a baseline survey, and an annual farm survey would be commissioned directly from&#13;
the Institute of Agriculture Economic, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb. The Institute of&#13;
Agriculture Economics is currently the only entity in Croatia to have the experience, staff and capacity&#13;
to carry out detailed empirical work in rural areas. MAF would implement the Market Information&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX C                                        - 130 -                       Project Implementation Plan&#13;
System through its Agriculture Policy Analysis Unit. The required TA, overseas training and computing&#13;
equipment for the establishment of the Market Information System would be procured through shortlisting&#13;
from a single qualified consulting firm.&#13;
4.        National advisors would be hired by private farmer associations under the Farmer Association&#13;
Advisor Pilot Scheme. Sufficient private sector advisors with the required qualifications are available in&#13;
Croatia because of their redundancy caused by the dismantling of the ex-social sector agro-kombinats and&#13;
will provide adequate competition. The advisors would be procured through advertising in the local press.&#13;
The advertisements announcing the need of the advisors will include their terns of reference, based on&#13;
standard terms of reference which will be reviewed by the Bank. MAF would prepare these standard&#13;
terms of reference and will submit them to the Bank for its review, prior to the publications of&#13;
advertisements. The appointment of the candidate selected by the farmer association would be subject to&#13;
MAF's approval.&#13;
5.        Procurement of training services and materials. To the extent feasible external fellowships&#13;
and training programs shall be included as part of the technical assistance packages procured from&#13;
consulting firms and training institutions; otherwise external fellowships and training would be awarded&#13;
on a direct contract basis with foreign institutions selected by MAF with the prior approval of the Bank.&#13;
In service, local training would be carried out by MAF, ARC, NVI, and NSA directly, or in&#13;
collaboration with national institutions on the basis of shortlisting with the assistance of the consultant&#13;
experts mentioned above. Prior to the beginning of it's fiscal year, during the life of the project, MAF&#13;
would prepare and submit to the Bank a detailed training and fellowship program for its review and&#13;
approval.&#13;
6.        Training materials which the Bank agrees are of a proprietary nature (e.g. technical&#13;
publications and journals/reference materials, computer software, etc.), may be acquired through Direct&#13;
Contracting from proprietors and/or copyright holders, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. The aggregate financing of training materials procured through Direct Contracting amounts to&#13;
approximately US$340,000. Development and publication of a farm management handbook, a veterinary&#13;
journal, and approximately 30 extension mass media packages (aggregate amount financed approximately&#13;
US$370,000) would be done on the basis of National Shopping.&#13;
7.        Procurement of research services. The ARC would award research contracts (estimated to&#13;
range from US$50,000 to US$150,000) under a competitive grant arrangement financed from the&#13;
Agriculture Research Fund supported by the Bank's Loan. The ARC would make public invitations for&#13;
research proposals, specifying the type of research, the methodology, and the scope of research work to&#13;
be carried out. Qualified national research organizations and enterprises (both public and private sector)&#13;
are eligible to submit research proposals which will be judged with the support of independent reviewers,&#13;
consisting of a team of experts from MOST under the responsibility of ARC, on their technical merit and&#13;
price competitiveness, and the contract will be awarded by the ARC. MOST would be responsible for&#13;
supervising the contracted research services. Laboratory and analytical equipment would be included into&#13;
the research proposal and would become a factor of evaluation of proposals. For the implementation of&#13;
this component a detailed operational manual would be prepared by MAF with the technical assistance&#13;
financed under a Japanese Grant Fund; MAF would submit this manual to the Bank for review to meet&#13;
the condition of disbursement under this component.&#13;
8.       Incremental operating costs. Incremental operating costs would be fully financed by&#13;
Government with recurrent cost items procured in accordance with regular Government procedures.&#13;
&#13;

9.        Procurement Review. The Bank would conduct a prior review of all ICB package and all the&#13;
first NCB and NS procurement packages for civil works, and the first NCB for goods. Prior Bank&#13;
approval would also be sought for all direct contracting. In addition, prior review would be undertaken&#13;
for all consulting contracts above US$100,000 (firms) and US$50,000 (individuals). The Bank's standard&#13;
bidding documents would be used for ICB packages and for the recruitment of consultants.&#13;
10.      Procurement information to be provided by the Borrower. The Borrower would promptly&#13;
inform the Bank of contract award and procurement issues and would include the following procurement&#13;
information in its progress reports:&#13;
(a) for equipment/materials, work contracts, technical assistance, training and study tours:&#13;
status and timing of all pending activities; and&#13;
(b) status of aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.&#13;

FARMERS SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX E&#13;
SUMMARY FARM MODEL AND PROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    During project preparation in June 1994 nine farm models were constructed so as to:&#13;
*  illustrate and check the likely farm level technical and production impacts of project&#13;
activities such as improved extension, research,veterinary services and input(seed) supply.&#13;
*  assess the financial viability of the new technical options in a range of farming systems and&#13;
locations.&#13;
v  assess the economic implications of the expected changes.&#13;
At appraisal in March 1995, five of these models were selected and updated. This annex describes and&#13;
presents the results of the analysis of these five models. The remaining four models are available on&#13;
diskette; they are not considered here so as to avoid undue complexity. Staff of the Institute of&#13;
Agricultural Economics, Faculty of Agronomy, University of Zagreb, participated actively in the&#13;
specification and analysis of the models. The University has a regular farm survey program and&#13;
completed additional interviews to check data used in the models with farmers and processors. In&#13;
particular, Mr. J. Kraljickovic and Mr. J. Juracak contributed much of the data needed to build the&#13;
models.&#13;
2.    The models are indicative and it is believed that they reflect changes which are likely to occur&#13;
on farms which are exposed to more focused extension services and have access to improved management&#13;
advice, seed, livestock and other inputs. Details of the models summarized here are given in Annex N&#13;
of the supplemental volume.&#13;
II. MODEL DESCRIPTIONS&#13;
A. GENERAL&#13;
3.    The project aims to strengthen support services to farmers which will enable them to improve&#13;
production efficiency, management and marketing. The project will help farmers to focus on the farm&#13;
as a business and to respond to market changes by varying activity patterns and input levels, as well as&#13;
improving technical efficiency. The key to this approach is an effective extension service with a&#13;
commercial orientation and access to quality research and technical services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX E                                         - 142 -                        Project Implementation Plan&#13;
4.    The crop and livestock budgets which form the basis of each farm or household model were&#13;
prepared in consultation with local agronomists and economists and checked by field discussion with&#13;
farmers, where possible. Generally they postulate crop yield increases of about 15 per cent with project&#13;
and include higher fertilizer, better seed inputs and improved livestock rations. Farm size has been held&#13;
constant between without and with project situations, although there are changes in cropping patterns&#13;
with project. The impact of investment to expand farm size, buy additional machinery or livestock or&#13;
to install irrigation, is examined separately in the proposed Rural Finance Pilot Project. Model farm size&#13;
is typically in the range 5 to 7 ha (except for intensive Dalmatia Vegetable model). This is a little larger&#13;
than average private farm size in these regions but there are many such farms and it is considered that&#13;
they are likely to respond first to improved support services.&#13;
5.    Most of the options available within FARMOD to model household level estimates were used&#13;
to provide a comprehensive description and assessment. Labor budgets show substantial annual surpluses&#13;
of family labor in all models, without and with project. Seasonal peaks in labor demand require use of&#13;
hired labor in the intensive vegetable models and most models do require incremental family labor with&#13;
project. Household consumption of farm produce has been included in each model and meets staple&#13;
grain, milk, egg and meat needs in most cases (exception high value vegetable model). Farm families will&#13;
have to draw upon the cash surpluses shown in each model to cover other food and living expenses.&#13;
Overhead costs are also included in each model to cover business expenses not readily allocated to&#13;
individual crop or livestock enterprises. Such costs are mostly in the range US$1,450 to US$1,800 per&#13;
farm and cover electricity, other fuel, land tax and insurance, tractor and equipment services and labor,&#13;
not related to individual crop activities.&#13;
6.    Very few private farms in Croatia have access to short or long term credit and so the financing&#13;
of production inputs in these models follows reality as both without and with project situations 100 per&#13;
cent of operating costs are financed by retained farm earnings from the previous year. Incremental&#13;
production costs typically lie in the range US$715 to US$2,200 per farm, or a little under half of the&#13;
expected gross value of incremental revenue. This is within the capacity of most model farms to finance,&#13;
either from without project retained earnings, from off-farm income or by moving to the with project&#13;
situation in steps over two or three years.&#13;
7.    Each model attempts to meet it's livestock feed needs from on-farm forage and crop production,&#13;
in line with usual practice in Croatia. There are exceptions for the vegetable model and some feed&#13;
additives and concentrates. Each model represents an individual farm and the with project situation has&#13;
not been phased in. The nature of most of the new technology proposed is such (better seeds, additional&#13;
fertilizer) that it is likely to be accepted promptly when the benefits are demonstrated clearly.&#13;
8.    The following five models are described in more detail below:&#13;
* Istria Mixed Farm Model&#13;
* Dalmatia Vegetable Farm Model&#13;
* Lika Mixed Farm Model&#13;
* Slavonija Crop Farm Model&#13;
* West Continental Dairy/Beef Farm Model&#13;

Project Implementation Plan                    - 143 -                                      ANNEX E&#13;
B. SPEcIc&#13;
Istria Mixed Farm Model&#13;
9.    This model may be applied to farms in the central area of the Istrian peninsular. Farms in this&#13;
area have opportunities to supply the local tourist industry and closer commercial ties to neighboring&#13;
countries than some other parts of Croatia. The model has a cropped area of 7.1 ha in both project&#13;
situations. The with project cropping pattern expands higher return potato and lucerne production and&#13;
deletes wheat and maize production so as to avoid large increments in labor or land use. Improved&#13;
technology is applied to barley, potato and lucerne production in the with project situation. Istria&#13;
traditionally provides hay and forage seeds to adjacent mountain areas and has adequate markets for&#13;
increased potato production. Although livestock activities comprise almost half of the gross value of&#13;
production no incremental livestock income is assumed, as it focuses on higher value crops.&#13;
10.   Family labor requirements increase from 1,220 hours per year to 1,410 hours with project, an&#13;
increment of 190 hours. This still leaves a large surplus which can be used in part to gain employment&#13;
in the tourist industry.&#13;
Dalmatia Vegetable Farm Model&#13;
11.   Dalmatia has a successful and expanding vegetable industry in part due to a warmer climate which&#13;
enables early harvest and access to high price, out-of-season markets in other parts of Croatia and nearby&#13;
countries. One of the main limits to expansion of production is a shortage of irrigation water and&#13;
investment to make better use of water is examined separately in the proposed Rural Finance Project. No&#13;
such investment is considered in this project. Joint marketing of vegetables is also being explored by&#13;
farmers in Dalmatia.&#13;
12.   This model has a small farm area of 1.2 ha but has by far the highest net value of production&#13;
of any model due to the focus on early tomato and potato crops and other vegetables. There are no&#13;
changes of cropping pattern assumed for the with project situation but crop yields are increased by 10&#13;
per cent mainly in response to higher fertilizer and manure inputs. Livestock are produced for home&#13;
consumption and there are no increments with project.&#13;
13.   Incremental family labor with project (to handle larger harvests) is 191 hour per year. Although&#13;
there is substantial unused family labor, hired labor is needed to meet seasonal peaks of demand and this&#13;
also increases with project, by 33 hours per year.&#13;
Lika Mixed Farm Model&#13;
14.   Lika is a mountainous area with much pasture land and some emphasis on livestock production.&#13;
The proposed Rural Finance Pilot Project includes a specialist sheep production model but this model&#13;
looks at changes in a mixed farm with crop, cattle and pig production. The model increases potato and&#13;
reduces wheat production with project in response to crop budget financial profitability; additionally dairy&#13;
cow numbers are increased from 3 to 4 and cheese making (600 kg per year) is introduced with project.&#13;
Financing is discussed in 3.2.3 below. There is a strong demand for local cheeses and the necessary skills&#13;
and interest in increasing production are available. Potato and barley yields are increased by about 15&#13;
per cent with project in response to use of better seed and more fertilizer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX E                                        - 144 -                       Project Implementation Plan&#13;
15.   The cropped area is constant at 5.8 ha in both project situations and is below total farm area&#13;
of 7.9 ha to allow for rotation and non-arable land.&#13;
16.   This model has the greatest increment in family labor input with project, 631 hour per year.&#13;
However with project labor is still only about half estimated available labor and most of the increment&#13;
is in high value cheese production yielding incremental hourly returns more than double average without&#13;
project returns.&#13;
Slavonija Crop Farm Model&#13;
17.   Slavonija is the major crop production region in Croatia. This model is representative of private&#13;
farms which are replacing the Agro-Kombinats as major producers in the region. The cropping pattern&#13;
changes with project to reduce sugar beet and maize area and to expand soybean, so as to improve self-&#13;
sufficiency in pig feed. Wheat, meadow and barley are constant, as is the total cropped area of 5.3 ha.&#13;
Almost half of the crops produced (by value) are used on-farm for livestock production. The model&#13;
includes 1 cow, 6 sows and a small poultry activity (no increment with project). Of these, the pig activity&#13;
is the main commercial livestock activity; with project weaner pig production increases by about 13 per&#13;
cent and ration costs are reduced. Crop yield increases of just under 15 per cent are achieved with better&#13;
fertilizer inputs and seeds.&#13;
18.   Family labor use in this model is near constant with and without project. The yield increases do&#13;
not demand additional labor as harvest is mechanized and the changes in cropping pattern do not create&#13;
new labor demands.&#13;
West Continental Dairy/Beef Farm Model&#13;
19.   This model has four Simmental cows in both project situations. Milk production increases from&#13;
2,800 1 to 3,360 1 per cow per year with project. Improved animal health, changed rations and better&#13;
genetic material are expected to be accessible through improved extension and veterinary services. The&#13;
cropped area remains constant at 4.3 ha but the pattern changes with project. Maize silage and mixed&#13;
grass pasture are introduced to boost feed supply with project and maize for grain and the less productive&#13;
meadow are reduced slightly. Mixed grass and other improved pastures would be stimulated by project&#13;
activities and gradually displace meadow and other unimproved pastures. Further increases in technical&#13;
and financial performance are possible, e.g. use of milk replacer for calf rearing or breed changes, and&#13;
practical but have not been considered as they are still uncommon in Croatia.&#13;
20.   Family labor requirements are virtually the same with and without project and are around 40 per&#13;
cent of estimated available labor. There is scope to expand the size of farms of this type but this is not&#13;
considered within this project. Increased farm size plus use of milk replacer would have a big positive&#13;
impact on milk collection costs and overall dairy industry efficiency.&#13;
III. FARM MODEL FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A. GENERAL&#13;
21.   The farm gate fmancial prices used in this analysis are those which prevailed in the main&#13;
production region for each item during March 1995. Minor seasonal adjustments were made and some&#13;
averaging was employed where prices differed between main producing regions. All analysis has been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                                       - 145 -                                                         ANNEX  E&#13;
completed in constant 1995 DEM; the apparent precision in some prices results from conversion of a&#13;
Kuna price quote to DEM at the March 1995 exchange rate. The prices used provide reliable farm gate&#13;
values for the expected incremental production. However it is clear that new marketing systems are being&#13;
developed and that prices do fluctuate from place to place and time to time.&#13;
22.      Each model shows net incremental farm  rmancial benefits which are likely to be attractive to&#13;
farmers in relation to the required additional purchased inputs and family labor. The analysis was for a&#13;
10 year period and the discount rate was set at 10 per cent. Labor returns in US$ per hour are&#13;
maintained or increased with project in each model. There are no additional investments required in the&#13;
models beyond the short term funding of crop and livestock inputs. When future financial cash flows are&#13;
discounted at 10 per cent, strong NPV's result. Switching values before financing at 10 per cent indicate&#13;
that in all models revenues can fall by at least 50 per cent or operating costs increase by at least 100&#13;
percent, before NPV falls to zero.&#13;

a/ These models attempt to quantify the possible impact of improved extensions services and access to quality research and other technical&#13;
services supported under the project. Farm size has been held constant between without and with project situations, although there are&#13;
changes in cropping pattems with project.&#13;
b/ The with project cropping pattem expands higher return potato and lucerne production and deletes wheat and maize production so as to&#13;
avoid large increments in labor or land use. Improved technology is applied to barley, potato and luceme production in the with project&#13;
situation. Istria traditionally provides hay and forage seeds to adjacent mountain areas and has adequate markets for increased potato&#13;
production. Although livestock activities comprise almost half of the gross value of production no incremental livestock income is&#13;
assumed, as it focuses on higher value crops. Family labor requirements increase from 1220 hours per year to 1410 hours with project,&#13;
an increment of 190 hours. This still leaves a large surplus which can be used in part to gain employment in the tourist industry.&#13;
c/ Dalmatia has a successful and expanding vegetable industry in part due to a warmer climate which enables early harvest and access to&#13;
high price, out-of-season markets in other parts of Croatia and nearby countries. No irrigation investment is included in this model. This&#13;
model has a small farm area of 1.2 ha but has by far the highest net value of production of any model due to the focus on early tomato&#13;
and potato crops and other vegetables. There are no changes of cropping pattem assumed for the with project situation but crop yields&#13;
are increased by 10 per cent mainly in response to higher fertilizer and manure inputs. Livestock are produced for home consumption&#13;
and there are no increments with project. Incremental family labor with project (to handle larger harvests) is 191 hour per year.&#13;
Although there is substantial unused family labor, hired labor is needed to meet seasonal peaks of demand and this also increases with&#13;
project, by 33 hours per year.&#13;

d/ Lika is a mountainous area with much pasture land and some emphasis on livestock production. This model looks at changes in a mixed&#13;
farm with crop, cattle and pig production. The model increases potato and reduces wheat production with project in response to crop&#13;
budget financial profitability; additionally dairy cow numbers are increased from 3 to 4 and cheese making (600 kg per year) is&#13;
introduced with project. There is a strong demand for local cheeses and the necessary skills and interest m increasmg production are&#13;
available. Pothto and barley yields are increased by about 15 per cent with project in response to use of better seed and more fertilizer.&#13;
The cropped area is constant at 5.8 ha in both project situations and is below total farm area of 7.9 ha to allow for rotation and non-&#13;
amble land. With project labor is only about half estimated available labor and most of the increment is in high value cheese production&#13;
yielding incremental hourly returns nearly double average without project returns.&#13;
et Slavonija is the major crop production region in Croatia. This model is representative of private farms which are replacing the Agro-&#13;
Kombinats as major producers in the region. The cropping pattern changes with project to reduce sugar beet and maize area and to&#13;
expand soybean, so as to improve farm self-sufficiency in pig feed. Wheat, meadow and barley are constant, as is the total cropped area&#13;
of 5.3 ha. Almost half of the crops produced (by value) are used on-farm for livestock production. The model includes 1 cow, 6 sows&#13;
and a small poultry activity (no increment with project). Of these, the pig activity is the main commercial livestock activity; with project&#13;
weaner pig production increases by about 13 per cent and ration costs are reduced. Crop yield increases of just under 15 per cent are&#13;
achieved with better fertilizer inputs and seeds. The yield increases do not demand additional labor as harvest is mechanized and the&#13;
changes in cropping pattern do not create new labor demands..&#13;
f/ This model has four Simmental cows in both project situations. Milk production increases from 2800 1 to 3360 1 per cow per year with&#13;
project. Improved animal health, changed rations and better genetic material are expected to be accessible through improved extension&#13;
and veterinary services. The cropped area remains constant at 4.3 ha but the pattem changes with project. Maize silage and mixed grass&#13;
pasture are introduced to boost feed supply with project and maize for mrain and the less productive meadow are reduced slighdy. Mixed&#13;
grass and other improved pastures would be stimulated by project activities and gradually displace meadow and other unimproved&#13;
pastures. Further increases in technical and financial performance are possible, e.g. use of milk replacer for calf rearing or breed&#13;
changes, and practical but have not been considered as they are stiDl uncommon in Croatia. Family labor requirements are virtually the&#13;
same with and without project and are around 40 per cent of estimated available labor. There is scope to expand the size of famis of this&#13;
type but this is not considered within this project.&#13;
B. SPEcIc&#13;
Istria Mixed Farm Model&#13;
23.      This model shows a gross incremental annual production value of US$2,740 on a without project&#13;
base of US$7,600. The model differs from others in that the increment is mainly achieved through a&#13;
change in cropping pattern to focus on more profitable crops, lucerne and potatoes. The net incremental&#13;
family benefit of US$1,350 is added to a very low without project base of US$1,460 per year. This is&#13;
a realistic description of the without project situation in Istria where many families live on part-time,&#13;
casual work in the tourist industry. The net return in US$ per hour of family labor rises from 1 to 2 with&#13;
project. No incremental livestock returns are budgeted. Alternative Istrian livestock models could be&#13;
developed, provided milk and meat markets are established.&#13;
24.      Incremental cash production costs are US$1,360 per year and this would have to be financed in&#13;
the first year by off-farm income or phased in over several years. The incremental cash needs are&#13;
equivalent to about 3 months employment in the hotel industry for one family member.&#13;
25.      The Net Present Value (NPV) before financing at 10 per cent is US$8,400. Switching value&#13;
analysis shows that incremental revenues cold be halved or operating costs rise by 101 per cent before&#13;
NPV declined to zero. This suggests that the model is robust and capable of absorbing large increases&#13;
in costs or medium to large falls in revenue, before returns fall below 10 per cent.&#13;
26.      More detailed data on this model is available in Farmod Tables 1-3-1 and 1-5-1 in Annex N  and&#13;
on diskette.&#13;
Dalmatia Vegetable Farm Model&#13;
27.      The improved production practices of this model increase gross value of production by US$3,410&#13;
on the very high annual base of US$34,100 without project. Some US$2,910 of the increment is from&#13;
vegetable production, with the balance from field crops. After incremental production costs and hired&#13;
labor are paid, the net family benefits increase by US$2,100 per year with project, above a base of&#13;
US$27,800. This is a small proportional increase but in practice larger increases rely on investment of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Project Implementation Plan                      - 147 -                                       ANNEX E&#13;
the type envisaged in the proposed Rural Finance Pilot Project,especially improved irrigation and&#13;
additional land. There are good markets available for the range of vegetables in the model, at the times&#13;
they are harvested, and farmers are beginning to consolidate shipments. There is a project role in market&#13;
infornation, extension support for scheduling plantings to ensure marketable quantities coincide and for&#13;
technical advice on crop protection/IPM in particular.&#13;
28.   Returns to family labor are high at US$13 per hour both without and with project. This is three&#13;
times higher than in the next most remunerative model and this income is reflected in the living standard&#13;
of the Dalmatian farmers who have already achieved the with project situation.&#13;
29.   Annual incremental cash costs are US$1,280 which is easily within the capacity of a farmer in&#13;
the without project situation to fund from retained earnings.&#13;
30.   The NPV before financing at 10 per cent (10 years) is US$13,100. Switching values show that&#13;
incremental inflows could fall by 63 per cent or incremental operating costs rise by 167 per cent before&#13;
the NPV declines to zero. Changes of that size are considered most unlikely, provided proper attention&#13;
is paid to marketing.&#13;
Lika Mixed Farm Model&#13;
31.   Overall net farm family benefits increase from US$3,590 per year without project to US$6,650&#13;
with project. This substantial increase is mainly achieved through increased livestock, especially cheese,&#13;
production. Cheese making investments are negligible and the process adds about US$870 net per year&#13;
to the value of milk otherwise sold fresh. It is appropriate in a region where milk collection costs are&#13;
high. The increment in family benefit is proportionally large in this model, as is the required increase&#13;
in labor input. Average returns to family labor increase from US$2 to US$3.8 per hour with project.&#13;
32.   Additional cash operating costs are US$2,615 per year with project. This is a substantial sum for&#13;
a family with a without project cash flow of US$3,580 per year. However milk and cheese returns will&#13;
be received monthly (compared to annually for most crops) and this greatly reduces financing needs. The&#13;
additional with project cow will be obtained by retention of a calf, with a negative impact of US$395 on&#13;
cash flow in the year of retention.&#13;
33.   The NPV for net incremental family benefits is US$840. This is the largest of any model and&#13;
reflects strong demand for livestock products and the technical opportunities available. Switching values&#13;
suggest that incremental revenues can fall by 53 per cent or added operating costs rise by 114 per cent&#13;
before NPV is reduced to zero. Such changes are most unlikely in this case.&#13;
SlavonUa Crop Farm Model&#13;
34.   Net Incremental family benefits in this model are US$840 per year on a base of US$5,680&#13;
without project. About 40 to 50 per cent of crop production is used or consumed on-farm, mainly for&#13;
pig produc.ion. The with project model seeks to supply superior pig rations from within the farm and&#13;
sacrifices some cash return from lower sugar beet production as a result. Given the low economic value&#13;
of local sugar beet production, such a change is likely to be forced in the short term and the financial&#13;
sacrifice may be apparent rather than real. Most of the increment in family benefit is earned through&#13;
higher pig sales and lower unit feed costs. Family labor returns rise from US$3.5 to US$4.3 per hour&#13;
with project.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX E                                         - 148 -                       Project Implementation Plan&#13;
35.   The changes in cropping pattern and pig ration mean that there is no increase in cash outflows&#13;
to be financed with project.&#13;
36.   The NPV before financing is US5,200 and switching values show that incremental inflows would&#13;
have to fall by 107 per cent to reduce NPV to zero. Because incremental operating costs are slightly&#13;
negative (i.e. with project operating cost is slightly lower than without project), incremental operating&#13;
costs would have to increase from minus US$350 to US$4,850 before the NPV return drops to zero.&#13;
West Continental Dairy/Beef Farm Model&#13;
37.   Net Incremental farm family benefits are US$1,090 on a without project base of US$4,990 per&#13;
year. These benefits are derived from improved cow management, health and feeding and some&#13;
incremental forage crop sales. Milk yield per cow rises from 3,500 to 4,025 1 per year and this is readily&#13;
marketable in north west Croatia. Return to family labor rises from US3 to US3.5 per hour with project.&#13;
38.   Incremental cash production costs are US$790 per year. This may be related to without project&#13;
annual production costs of US$3,400. Given that milk payments are made monthly rather than&#13;
annually, as with crops, most families should be able to fund the incremental cash needs from their own&#13;
resources.&#13;
39.   The NPV is US$6,760 for incremental family benefits and switching values show that a 58 per&#13;
cent fall in incremental inflows or a 140 per cent increase in operating costs would be needed to reduce&#13;
NPV to zero. The dairy model is robust but small in scale and could profitably be more than doubled in&#13;
size if investment funds were available.&#13;
IV. FARM MODEL ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. GENERAL&#13;
40.   Annex M presents estimates of economic prices (in terms of nominal protection coefficient -&#13;
NPC) for key commodities and inputs: wheat, maize, soybeans, sugar beet, milk and fertilizer. The&#13;
reciprocals of the NPC's of Annex M have been used as conversion factors in FARMOD prices to&#13;
calculate economic prices for the above items. In all other cases (outputs and inputs) the conversion&#13;
factor 1.0 has been used, equating financial and economic prices. For these models the other main&#13;
incremental products(not listed above) are meat and vegetables. Croatia currently engages in only small&#13;
amounts of international trade in meat and vegetables and there are no major subsidies in place to support&#13;
their production. In this situation it seems reasonable to accept a NPC of 1.0. Incremental labor has also&#13;
been valued at market price in the economic analysis although it is likely that economic labor value may&#13;
be lower in some locations. The five models show a similar distribution of annual economic benefit to&#13;
that existing in financial terms: three models are similar in size of without project economic benefit&#13;
(-US$1,800 per year) , the Dalmatia Vegetable Model yields benefits more than ten times larger&#13;
(US$24,000) and the Istrian model yields a small negative return (-US$190)without project.&#13;
41.   All models show positive increments in net economic value of production with project and have&#13;
positive economic Net Production Values (NPVs), usually a little lower than the corresponding financial&#13;
NPV, at 1995 prices and NPC's. The analysis was for a 10 year period and the discount rate was set&#13;
at 10 per cent. As changes in policy are implemented it is likely that production shifts will occur to&#13;
further increase the economic value of incremental production. The Slavonija Crop Farm Model is an&#13;

existing example of a situation in which expected poor economic performance is improved by much of&#13;
the incremental production being in the form of pig meat produced by feeding low value grains and by&#13;
a reduction in the with project area of the most heavily subsidized crop (i.e., sugarbeet).&#13;

42.    Simple comparisons between financial and economic increments (such as those in Table E.2) can&#13;
be misleading, if used as proxy NPC's. First incremental family labor costs have been deducted by&#13;
FARMOD in calculating economic increments but not financial increments. There are big differences&#13;
between models in incremental family labor.&#13;
B. SPECIFIC&#13;
Istria Mixed Farm Model&#13;
43.    The Istrian model has a negative economic and low positive financial annual return in the&#13;
without project situation. This assessment is supported by the existence of abandoned farms in Istria.&#13;
However both the model and farm visits clearly show that economic and financial profitability is feasible,&#13;
provided production is focused on higher return crops or livestock activities, especially those related to&#13;
the tourist market. This model takes a conservative approach (in that further crop changes towards high&#13;
value production could be managed and livestock improvement also included, but these opportunities have&#13;
been ignored with project) and shows incremental annual economic benefits of US$1,290 with project&#13;
and a NPV of US$8,100 for net economic benefits at 10 per cent over 10 years. The economic and&#13;
financial NPV's are similar as most of the incremental production comprises potatoes and forage which&#13;
have identical financial and economic prices in the model. Table 1-4-1 in Annex N presents more detailed&#13;
data.&#13;
Dalmatia Vegetable Farm Model&#13;
44.    The Dalmatia model also shows similar economic and financial returns as incremental production&#13;
is confined to vegetables with a price conversion factor of 1.0 in the model. The net economic increment&#13;
of US$1,930 per year results in a NPV of US$12,070, after incremental family labor of US$280 per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX E                                        - 150 -                        Project Implementation Plan&#13;
year is deducted. This increment is small relative to the without project net economic return of&#13;
US$24,420.&#13;
Lika Mixed Farm Model&#13;
45.   This model yields an economic increment of US$2,360 on a base of US$1,510 without project.&#13;
The NPV is US$14,700 the highest of any model. This performance relies in part on the sale of specialty&#13;
cheese at full market price with project, compared to the sale of milk (NPC 1.25) without project. The&#13;
economic increment is estimated after the deduction of incremental family labor (US$765); the financial&#13;
increment is presented as a return to labor. If the financial and economic increments are compared on&#13;
a consistent labor basis, they are similar in this model.&#13;
Slavonija Crop Model&#13;
46.Interpretation of the economic analysis of this model is complex. The economic increment of&#13;
US$1,290 exceeds the financial increment of US$840. The increment is earned on a base economic&#13;
return of US$2,100 per farm per year. Sugar beet has a large economic loss per ha and the effect of&#13;
reducing sugar beet area in the with project situation is to reduce farm returns by US$190 in financial&#13;
prices and increase them by US$180 in economic prices, a net difference of US$370 per farm in favor&#13;
of the economic increment. Additionally the main production increment is pig meat which has identical&#13;
financial and economic prices in this model. The NPV is US$8,050.&#13;
West Continental Dairy/Beef Farm Model&#13;
47.   The NPV for economic increments in this model is US$6,100. This is based on an annual&#13;
increment of US$970 above the without project level of US$1,990. This is slightly below the financial&#13;
increment as milk has an NPC of 1.26, although incremental forage sales have equal financial and&#13;
economic value in the model. The net economic effect of other changes in the with project case is small.&#13;
V. FARM ANALYSIS: CONCLUSION&#13;
48.   Financial analysis of the five models indicates that:&#13;
* project activities are likely to yield sufficient rmancial benefit to farmers, of the kinds&#13;
modelled, to encourage them to participate in or actively use better extension, animal health&#13;
services, seeds and market information. Annual financial increments range from a low of 8 per&#13;
cent of the high base earnings in Dalmatia to a high of 92 per cent of the low Istrian base.&#13;
* in most of the models farmers clearly have the ability to fund incremental short term inputs&#13;
from retained earnings, monthly milk payments or pig sales. In the Istrian model it may be&#13;
necessary for farmers to fund the added inputs from off-farm work in the tourist industry or by&#13;
phasing changes over several years.&#13;
* switching values indicate that the models are robust, requiring an increases of more than 100&#13;
per cent in operating costs or a fall of more than 50 per cent in incremental inflows to reduce&#13;
NPV to zero at 10 percent.&#13;

* financial benefits may be earned through changes in cropping pattern or livestock&#13;
processing/marketing as well as increased technical efficiency.&#13;
* there is a substantial surplus of farm labor available on the modelled farms.&#13;
* farmers have an ability to pay for useful services, especially where the scale of operation is&#13;
large enough to cover overheads and basic living costs or where high value vegetable, cheese&#13;
or similar products are involved.&#13;
49.    Economic analysis concludes that positive incremental returns are earned in each model, given&#13;
the NPC's estimated in Annex M. Even in Slavonija where several common crops have higher NPC's,&#13;
the usual practice on private farms is to feed these crops to livestock with strong positive economic and&#13;
financial results.&#13;
VI. PROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
50.   Based on the results of the farm model analysis previously discussed, the following economic&#13;
analysis attempts to quantify the project net incremental economic returns. Quantifying the economic&#13;
returns of the vast range of project activities including agriculture extension, applied research, animal&#13;
health, pasture and fodder development, seed industry development, and agriculture policy support is&#13;
notoriously difficult, given the broad range of non-service factors influencing decision making at the farm&#13;
level, and uncertainties associated with the translation of improved farm services into economic farn&#13;
benefits. The purpose of estimating project returns, therefore, is to verify that the project is broadly&#13;
economically viable and robust to changes in project cost and benefits. The following analysis is based&#13;
on a number of conservative assumptions discussed below. Economic flows are calculated over a ten year&#13;
time horizon, albeit benefits are expected to accrue well beyond the tenth year.&#13;
B. PROJECT INCREMENTAL BENEFITS&#13;
51.   Project benefits are based only on economic farm returns as identified under the indicative farm&#13;
models described above. Many other potential benefits occurring outside the farmn have not been&#13;
quantified such as export losses avoided through improved animal disease control, improved export&#13;
earnings by the seed subsector in the context of an improved regulatory framework, the possible positive&#13;
fiscal impact of a more rational agriculture policy, or improved environmental sustainability through&#13;
better extension and research services. Project benefits also exclude the potential positive impact of&#13;
improved farm services on the transition of the agro-kombinat sector. Hence, economic returns to this&#13;
project may be somewhat underestimated.&#13;
52.   In order to obtain economic benefits on a ha basis, the net annual incremental value of production&#13;
(in economic terms) of the individual model farms is divided by the area under cultivation by the&#13;
respective farm (see Table E.3, columns 1 to 4). The economic benefits on a ha basis, representing the&#13;
major farming areas in Croatia are weighted by the share of the respective farming area in overall&#13;
agriculture area in the country, resulting in a weighted average net incremental value of production per&#13;
ha of arable land, i.e US$385 ha/year (Table E.3, columns 5 and 6). To obtain the potential annual&#13;
incremental value of production of private agriculture making full use of project services, this figure is&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX E                                                 - 152 -                            Project Implementation Plan&#13;
multiplied by the area of arable land privately farmed (i.e. roughly 1.6 million ha). The actual project&#13;
benefits are, however, likely to be realized only by a much smaller share of the private farming&#13;
community; in the analysis it is conservatively assumed that only 5 percent of farmers (i.e. some 25,000&#13;
out of 500,000 farmers) would reap the full benefit of the project. Total annual project farm benefits are&#13;
estimated to be in the order of US$31 million (Table E.3, columns 7 and 8). As agriculture service-&#13;
related benefits require time to materialize, it is, again conservatively, estimated that the mentioned&#13;
annual benefit stream sets in only in Year 6 of the calculation, i.e. in the second year after project&#13;
implementation; no benefits are assumed to accrue during implementation and during the first year after&#13;
project implementation (see Table E.4).&#13;

C. PROJECT INCREMENTAL COSTS&#13;
53.    Project investment and recurrent costs (see Annex B for details), all of which are incremental,&#13;
have been included in the analysis net of taxes and duties (i.e. net of transfer payments). Replacement&#13;
costs are assumed at a level of 25 percent of total project investment costs, while recurrent costs are&#13;
applied in each of the ten years of the analysis equivalent to the level required at full project development.&#13;
Project incremental costs are shown in Table E.4 below.&#13;
D. PROJECT NET INCREMENTAL BENEFiTS&#13;
54.    The net incremental benefit stream for the project based on the described incremental costs and&#13;
benefits is given in Table E.4 below. The project yields an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 28 percent.&#13;

E. SENsrnviTY ANALYSIS&#13;
55.    In order to test the sensitivity of project returns to variations in costs and benefits, major&#13;
parameters have been varied as indicated in Table E.5 below. The ERRs indicate that project returns are&#13;
robust to significant increases in costs and decreases benefits (20 percent respectively). A 20 percent&#13;
decrease in benefits could occur from a reduced number of farmers being reached by the various support&#13;
services (i.e. 20,000 farmers rather than 25,000 farmers in the base case). Only when cost increase and&#13;
benefits decrease by 20 percent and benefits lag by one year does the project become economically&#13;
unviable. The likelihood of the three events occurring jointly is considered low.&#13;

FARMERS SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX F&#13;
PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY&#13;
1.        According to World Bank rules, an Environmental Analysis (EA) is required prior to the&#13;
implementation of the "Farmer Support Services Project" (FSSP). The Ministry of Agriculture and&#13;
Forestry (MAF) of the Republic of Croatia assigned this task to an expert team competent in EA&#13;
questions, consisting of Mr. Ferdo Basic Ph.D., Mr. Zoran Griic Ph.D. - Faculty of Agronomy,&#13;
University of Zagreb, and Ms. Visnja Jelic-Muck B.Sc., State Directorate for Environment Protection.&#13;
2.        The team reviewed the project documentation to identify potential positive or negative impacts&#13;
of FSSP on environment. The EA task can be summarized into a few objectives:&#13;
* To assess the actual environmental situation, before FSSP implementation, and to&#13;
identify potential direct and indirect impacts on the environment; and&#13;
*  To review the existing legislation as it relates to the use of agrochemicals, fertilizers,&#13;
animal feed stuffs and veterinary drugs.&#13;
3.       It is important to point out that FSSP is, according to the World Bank regulations, a category&#13;
B project which means that it has a limited impact on the environment.&#13;
4.        The activities to be implemented under the FSSP have a great importance for the promotion&#13;
and recognition of ecologically sustainable management of Croatian national resources.&#13;
5.       In implementing this project, no negative environmental impacts are expected. It is realistic&#13;
to expect that the effects of some project components will strengthen the notion of sustainable agriculture&#13;
which combines technologies, policies and activities aimed at integrating socioeconomic principles with&#13;
environmental concerns so as to simultaneously: maintain or enhance production, minimize risk of&#13;
diminished food production, protect natural resources and prevent degradation of soil and water quality,&#13;
all with a view to being economically viable and socially acceptable.&#13;
6.        This EA does not propose a specific mitigation plan (nor does it cost mitigation efforts)&#13;
because no direct negative environmental impacts are anticipated in the context of implementing this&#13;
project. However, as a crucial mitigation activity during the first year of project implementation, MAF&#13;
would develop special ('best practice') guidelines for its extension service and the farming community&#13;
in support of the concept and practices of sustainable agriculture and appropriate handling of agriculture&#13;
chemicals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

A major contribution to the development of these best practice guidelines can be expected&#13;
rern the findings of the on-going project on 'Proper Handling of Pesticides and their Residues in&#13;
.4gr^iculture Practice" managed by the Agency for Special and Dangerous Waste.&#13;
In addition, MAF will organize an  "International Workshop on Water Pollution and&#13;
Protection in Agriculture Practices" in Zagreb, in October, 1995. This workshop will be organized in the&#13;
framework of the new international project on "Pollution of Ground and Surface Water by Nitrates,&#13;
Heavy Metals and Pesticides through Percolation from Agriculture Areas" which has been suggested by&#13;
Croatia and accepted by the Third Session of the FAO/ECE Working Party on Relations between&#13;
Agriculture and Environmnent, held in Geneva in 1994.&#13;
9.        In presenting the Environmental Analysis, we want to emphasize the suggestions made by the&#13;
Deputy Ministers, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Mr. Vlado Bicanic and Dr. Stjepan Tanic. We&#13;
take this opportunity to express our appreciation for their cooperation.&#13;
[l, EXISTING STATE OF ENVIRONMENT, REGIONAL STRUCTURE AND OWNERSHIP&#13;
0.       The heterogeneity of agro-ecological conditions in Croatia suggests regional differences in&#13;
structure of agriculture, level and direction of its development, and, accordingly, the state of the&#13;
environment. Project implementation will also affect the various agro-ecological environments in&#13;
different ways.&#13;
11.      The major impact of agriculture in general on the environment is on agricultural land and&#13;
water resources. That is why the review of the environment situation is based on agricultural regions.&#13;
Tlhere are pedological characteristics, geo-morphological (soil type) and geo-lithological (climate) features,&#13;
all contributing to a characterization essential for crop and livestock production.&#13;
I2        No reliable national database exists which would assist project designers, and implementing&#13;
agencies in assessing the extent and importance of issues such as risky soil management practices, narrow&#13;
crop rotation, soil erosion, persistent herbicide use, and the intensity of agriculture inputs, given the&#13;
complete lack of systematic research in these and related fields. Therefore, the statements made below,&#13;
though important, should be viewed more as a descriptive assessment without a systematic empirical&#13;
basis. These judgments are inferred from occasional and isolated small-scale research work undertaken&#13;
in the past which should be seen as descriptive indicators rather than quantification of a prevailing&#13;
situation in a given agricultural region.&#13;
A. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN AGRICULTURAL REGIONS OF CROATIA&#13;
:. iAgricultural area in Croatia is composed of three regions, and smaller agro-ecological&#13;
subregions (See Figure F. 1)&#13;
Pannonian Region&#13;
14.       This region comprises the largest share (54.2%) of Croatian territory, and it is the most&#13;
Xvaluable agricultural region in the state. Known as the Pannonian plane, the region can be distinguished&#13;
into four subregions, with corresponding particularities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

PI - Eastern Panonian Subregion&#13;
15.        This subregion is distinctly crop area in nature. Dominant crops are wheat, maize, sugar&#13;
beet, soybean and sunflower in the plains, and exceptionally valuable vineyard plantations on the hilly&#13;
areas. In this subregion, the largest concentration of production lies in the ex-social sector, where highly&#13;
intensive agricultural production has been applied, especially with respect to crop production (less so for&#13;
livestock production) and predominantly in the form of semi-liquid manure. For more than five decadec..&#13;
farmyard manure has not been used. There has been a process of anthropogenic soil degradation arisinP&#13;
from the intensive farming primarily on ex-social sector farms resulting in:&#13;
*  anthropogene soil compaction;&#13;
*  herbicide deposition (especially atrazin), due to narrowed crop rotation, especially v ir0-&#13;
respect to maize;&#13;
*  decreased humus content; and&#13;
*   soil erosion by wind and water&#13;
16.        There are also noted occurrence of subsurface water contamination by nitrates and&#13;
eutrophication of water flows. It is expected that the average private household acreage will increase as&#13;
the ownership structure changes in favor of private ownership.   Increased investments in irriga;io,n&#13;
systems in the future which are, however, outside the scope of the activities supported by FSSP ul ill&#13;
enable more intensive crop cultivation (especially vegetables) as well as secondary crop cultivation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX F                                           - 158 -                         Project Implementation Plan&#13;
17.       An essentially different and more favorable situation is that of fragmented private farms,&#13;
where traditional production is practiced, with high share of livestock production and common use of&#13;
farmyard manure. Processes of soil degradation have not been registered, except in cases of wind and&#13;
water erosion.&#13;
P2 - Central Pannonian Subregion&#13;
18.       The production structure in this subregion is dominated by intensive crop farming in the&#13;
plains, and on all slopes (hill-sides). Vineyard and livestock production is particularly prevalent in the&#13;
south. The ex-social sector is not extensive and fragmented private farms dominate. Crop production&#13;
is pervasive with some orchard and vineyard production. In relation to the previous subregion, there is&#13;
a growing trend in the use of livestock and farmyard manure. Favorable conditions and a prospective&#13;
development exists for vegetable growing, with irrigation.&#13;
19.       On soils among the ex-social sector, the processes of anthropogenetic soil degradation is&#13;
registered, whereas soil among the private sector is considerably more preserved, owing to a higher&#13;
importance of livestock production and integrated farming.   Relief is more complex here, as soil&#13;
structure is unstable and more vulnerable to erosion by water, compounded also with a high share of&#13;
maize in crop rotation. That is why particular attention should be given to soil conservation.&#13;
P3 - Western Pannonian Subregion&#13;
20.       In this subregion, private, fragmented households clearly predominate. Livestock production&#13;
is developed to the extent that the support from grazing stock is necessary. Consequently, a significant&#13;
and untapped potential exits for development of sheep- and goat-breeding. The basic direction for&#13;
investment has to be into irrigation and drainage for vegetable growing, and considering that the soil is&#13;
mainly acidic, it should be taken into account that liming needs to carried out regularly to correct the&#13;
acidic soil. Extraordinarily favorable conditions exist for fruit-and wine growing development as well.&#13;
21.       One of the ecologically questionable management practices on soils in this subregion is&#13;
narrow crop rotation in favor of maize, which stimulates erosion, and for which increasing herbicide use&#13;
is regularly used, contributing to a high persistence in soil, such as in the case of atrazin.&#13;
22.       Within this subregion there are also concentrated sources of emission of different ecologically&#13;
risky substances, such as industrial plants in Zagreb, ironworks and petroleum refinery in Sisak and food-&#13;
processing industries in Vrbovec and Koprivnica.&#13;
P4 - Northwestern Pannonian Subregion&#13;
23.       Clearly dominated by private and exceptionally fragmented households, this subregion's&#13;
arable crop production is oriented towards feed stuff production. An ecologically doubtful management&#13;
practice here is the high share of maize production within the crop rotation. This is compounded by high&#13;
rainfalls in Spring combined with a period of black fallow soil, and also because crop stands are too thin&#13;
to cover and protect the soil.&#13;
24.       Soils in this region require conservation measures such as in drainage in the Varazdin region&#13;
and irrigation in the Medjimurie region. In addition, the especially valuable use of liming is implemented&#13;
regularly and systematically. This area is very densely populated and households are highly fragmented.&#13;
The social sector is negligibly small.&#13;

Mountain Region&#13;
25.        This region comprises 14.2%  of the total area, and involves the thinly populated Pery&#13;
Mountain and Pery Mountain subregions. Mainly wooded areas with little agricultural land, traditional&#13;
and extensive production exists only on private and poor households. Soil is completely preserved from&#13;
any form of degradation or damage, except natural erosion. The virgin nature has crystal-clear and&#13;
beautiful rivers which are of an exceptional quality for irrigation.&#13;
GI - Pery Mountain Subregion&#13;
26.        Production capabilities of this area are potentially huge, but totally unused.  Especially&#13;
favorable conditions exist for the development of livestock production, indeed for all forms of ecological&#13;
agriculture. Almost without exception, soils require liming, and drainage in water-carrying valleys as&#13;
well. A possible vegetable production orientation would require irrigation, for which extraordinary&#13;
conditions exist here. Potential hydroelectric development among the pristine rivers would open the way&#13;
for irrigation.&#13;
G2 - Mountain Subregion&#13;
27.        This subregion is mountainous, built mostly of Mesozoic limestones and dolomite of high&#13;
cleanliness. Silicate sandstone and metamorphic rocks are also present. The subregion is characterized&#13;
by a mountain climate, with great amounts of precipitation causing erosion and acidification. A frost-free&#13;
period is short, so the selection of crops is narrowed to those resistant to a very unfavorable climate&#13;
conditions, like rye and potato. Favorable conditions exist for production of seed-potato which could be&#13;
produced in quantities exceeding Croatian needs and merit further attention. Beside investments in&#13;
irrigation, there is need to finance agro-technical soil melioration, particularly calcification.&#13;
28.        Private ownership is fragmented, with a prevailing orientation towards livestock production,&#13;
particularly sheep- and goat-breeding. Given the clear beautiful rivers, the national park of the Plitvice&#13;
Lakes located in this area, as well as botanical preserves and natural gardens, conditions are exceptionally&#13;
favorable for tourism.&#13;
Mediterranean Region&#13;
29.        This region comprises 31.6% of Croatia's coastal area and islands, and is quite diverse in soil&#13;
and climate characteristics.&#13;
MI - Northern Mediterranean Subregion&#13;
30.        This subregion involves the northern coastal area and north littoral islands. It differs from&#13;
other subregions in that it has a relatively large soil area on a flysh deposit subject to erosion to a serious&#13;
degree. Efficient soil protection is a precondition to any agricultural production in this area.&#13;
31.        Soils of this subregion are highly productive, given the favorable climatic conditions (warm&#13;
temperatures), and a valuable substratum for agricultural production, particularly with regard to&#13;
Mediterranean crops such as olives, grapes, almonds, peaches, nectarines, mandarins, and also high&#13;
quality vegetables, for which irrigation would, however, be necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX F                                             - 160 -                         Project Implementation Plan&#13;
32.        Private farms are small and fragmented, and use of the high production potentials is minimal.&#13;
A basic limiting factor is unfavorable distribution of rainfall and the typical summer droughts. Any&#13;
investment here would have to include irrigation for which there is enough water.&#13;
M2 - Central Mediterranean Subregion&#13;
33.        This region includes the central part of the coast, with continental background and the&#13;
belonging islands. It is this area that exemplifies the traditionally developed agriculture such as wine-&#13;
growing, fruit-growing, vegetable-and flower-growing both on fields and in glass-houses.&#13;
34.        It is expected that investments to ameliorate irrigation systems will take place. The ex-social&#13;
sector is relatively highly represented in this area. The typical, geomorphological units, so-called Karst&#13;
field, with its deep and productive soil, is extremely drained. These are usually flooded during the&#13;
autumn and winter period and in summer period without rain, the water level falls into Karst subsurface.&#13;
Because Karst areas are especially sensitive, usage of agro-chemicals has to be extremely rational and of&#13;
the mobile variety. Persistent pesticides must be avoided, with regard to quantity and timing. Adversely,&#13;
use of persistent pesticides might come to contaminate soil and waters of the area, with serious&#13;
consequences for a even wider area. Agriculture production in the wider area of Vransko Lake deserves&#13;
particular attention, especially considering the different potential uses of such a valuable water resource.&#13;
M3 - Southlern Mediterranean Subregion&#13;
35.        Ex-social sector representation is negligible in this subregion. More common are small&#13;
privately-owned plots. Common Mediterranean crops are mandarins, olives, figs, but also peaches, and&#13;
cherries and all kinds of vegetables and flowers on fields and in sheltered areas (glass-houses). A&#13;
c.ommon characteristic of all products from this area is their high quality. Investments are necessary,&#13;
inter alia, in irrigation, and special importance should also be given to island revitalization.&#13;
36.        Specially valuable and ecologically sensitive units within this subregion is the river and valley&#13;
of Neretva, where fertile soil can be found, along with plenty of sunny days, the Mediterranean climate,&#13;
and plenty of high-quality water. Skilled and hardworking farmers there practice very intensive growing&#13;
of all Meditecranean crops such as mandarins, vine and vegetables. Because of regular usage of large&#13;
quantities of various agrochemicals, there are some signs of disturbances in the locally sensitive&#13;
ecosystems.&#13;
B. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES BY OWNERSHIP&#13;
37.        Applied cultivation operations in Croatian agriculture have influenced, inter alia, soils and&#13;
water. The direction and intensity of that influence is sharply different with regard to farm ownership;&#13;
there are negative influences on soil and water in the ex-social sector, while there is little or no negative&#13;
influence among the private sector.&#13;
38.        Again, due to the absence of reliable data it is not possible to provide a full quantified&#13;
assessment within the scope of this EA of the impact of different farm types as well as the impact of the&#13;
project on environmental conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                         - 161 -                                          ANNEX F&#13;
Ex-social Sector&#13;
39.        With regard to soils within the ex-social sector, all intensive agricultural operations have been&#13;
carried out, involving usage of large quantities of agrochemicals (mineral fertilizers, pesticides, esp.&#13;
herbicides including those of the atrazin group), and processes of anthropogene soil and subsurface water&#13;
degradation have been registered. Among these are:&#13;
Anthropogenic soil compaction and structural damage due to:&#13;
* overtillage, using heavy machinery;&#13;
* tillage in improper moisture conditions; and&#13;
* unfavorable changes of organic matter regime (lack of soil structure forming and&#13;
stabilizing agents).&#13;
Decrease of humus content and humus quality due to&#13;
*  improper recycling of organic residues;&#13;
*  lack of organic fertilizers; and&#13;
*  soil acidification (leaching, mineral and liquid fertilizers, acidic depositions, air&#13;
pollution), and biological degradation (undesirable changes in microbial populations:&#13;
total number, species, activity).&#13;
Soil and water pollution due to:&#13;
*  absorbed and insoluble P compounds transported by surface runoff directly to surface&#13;
water result in increasing eutrophication and unfavorable changes in the aquatic&#13;
ecosystems;&#13;
*  nitrate pollution of subsurface water caused by liquid manure application and&#13;
irrational or improper N fertilizer application not adequately selected for the crop&#13;
requirement (nutrient uptake), soil properties, and weather conditions, time of&#13;
application, etc.; and&#13;
*  pesticides and other organic chemicals pollution;&#13;
40.        Soil erosion (strong surface runoff, lack of permanent cover of crops, steep slopes, heavy&#13;
rainfall but limited infiltration), implies considerable loss of organic matter and plant nutrients, silting&#13;
of waterways, canals, and reservoirs, and increases the cost of more frequent cleaning and increasing&#13;
hazards of water logging and floods in the lower parts of the watershed.&#13;
Private Sector&#13;
41.        The practice of integrated, extensive production and greater coverage of livestock is the&#13;
reason why soil conditions are much better among private farms. Nevertheless, on some soils of private&#13;
households, the process of intensive erosion had been registered, particularly in the northwestern&#13;
Pannonian subregion, as well as in the complete Mediterranean area. Besides natural factors, one reason&#13;
for this situation is the unfavorable orientation of plots and plowing up and down the slope. In addition,&#13;
erosion is aggravated by the mix of main crops, especially when the rotation includes maize.&#13;
42.        Deposition of herbicides in these zones accumulates in the mountain base, leaching into the&#13;
water flows, which in turn causes water pollution. These pesticide residues lead to water eutrophication&#13;
among the water flows. Water pollution by nitrates also appears on sites where large quantities of poultry&#13;
manure are used on the acid, drained, light, gravely soils of northwestern Croatia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX F                                          - 162 -                       Project Implementation Plan&#13;
III. POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE PROJECT ON ENVIRONMENT&#13;
A. STARTING POINT&#13;
43.       The Farmer Support Services Project is conceived to involve agricultural research,&#13;
agricultural extension, animal health services, fodder and pasture development, seed industry development&#13;
(through institutional and regulatory development), and strengthen MAF's policy formulation capacities.&#13;
Since the Croatian private sector has historically been an avid supporter of ecologically sustainable&#13;
agricultural production, progress in these fields will strengthen the future development of sustainable&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
44.       No negative environmental impacts are expected in the course of FSSP implementation. It&#13;
is realistic to expect that the effects of some project components will strengthen the notion of sustainable&#13;
agriculture which combines technologies, policies and activities aimed at integrating socioeconomic&#13;
principles with environmental concerns so as to simultaneously: maintain or enhance production,&#13;
minimize risk of diminished food production, protect natural resources and prevent degradation of soil&#13;
and water quality, all with a view to being economically viable and socially acceptable.&#13;
45.       This EA does not propose a specific mitigation plan (nor does it cost mitigation efforts)&#13;
because no direct negative environmental impacts are anticipated in the context of implementing this&#13;
project. However, as a crucial mitigation activity during the first year of project implementation, MAF&#13;
would develop special ('best practice') guidelines for its extension service and the farming community&#13;
in support of the concept and practices of sustainable agriculture and appropriate handling of agriculture&#13;
chemicals.&#13;
46.       A major contribution to the development of these best practice guidelines can be expected&#13;
from the findings of the on-going project on "Proper Handling of Pesticides and their Residues in&#13;
Agriculture Practice" managed by the Agency for Special and Dangerous Waste.&#13;
47.       In addition, MAF will organize an  "International Workshop on Water Pollution and&#13;
Protection in Agriculture Practices" in Zagreb, in October, 1995. This workshop will be organized in the&#13;
framework of the new international project on "Pollution of Ground and Surface Water by Nitrates,&#13;
Heavy Metals and Pesticides through Percolation from Agriculture Areas" which has been suggested by&#13;
Croatia and accepted by the Third Session of the FAO/ECE Working Party on Relations between&#13;
Agriculture and Environment, held in Geneva in 1994.&#13;
B. EXPECTED TRENDS&#13;
48.       It cannot be forgotten that private farmers have historically been economically discriminated&#13;
against. Providing new economic power will lead to possible trends toward intensification of agricultural&#13;
production. Due to a certain "hunger in agrochemicals application" an unfavorable "polarization"&#13;
tendency in agrochemicals application may occur under two possible scenarios:&#13;
Scenario A:  Better soil - rich farmer - higner rate of agrochemical (in spite of the possible&#13;
lower requirements) - better nutrient status of soil - overdosage&#13;
Scenario B:  Poor soil - poor farmer - lower rate of agrochemicals (in spite of the possible&#13;
higher requirements) - lower nutrient supply of soils - underdosage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                      - 163 -                                        ANNEX F&#13;
49.       Certain new dangers may present themselves as new agricultural land users are motivated to&#13;
realize as high a profit as possible in the short term. The short-term market-oriented production of land&#13;
users may lead to environmental damager because of the lack of necessary (and sometimes expensive)&#13;
preventive measures, especially in cases when harmful side-effects are detectable only one or two years&#13;
later or when they appear in the surrounding environment (nitrate pollution, acidification).&#13;
50.       Project implementation opens the way to a trend to overdosage under Scenario A (the&#13;
"maximum concept" principle), which, if the problem does not get sufficient attention, may cause various&#13;
environmental damages:&#13;
*  soil acidification;&#13;
*  contamination of drinking water resources by nitrate leaching;&#13;
*  accumulation of harmful toxic elements in the various stages of the "food chain".&#13;
51.       However, project implementation also opens a set of desirable processes and effects, which&#13;
will undoubtedly result positively on the environment. In the first place, FSSP finances research work&#13;
which seeks to define optimal management practices in agriculture. Secondly, Extension Service activities&#13;
are financed to provide accurate and professional information about all aspects of ecologically risky&#13;
management practices. In order to achieve this objective MAF would develop "Best Practices" Guidelines&#13;
for its extension service on the concept and practice of sustainable agriculture and on the handling of&#13;
agriculture chemicals.&#13;
52.       In addition, privatization will increase ownership feeling and more care for maintaining long-&#13;
run soil fertility and sustaining the environment. A private household, especially a family farm, allows&#13;
for much more flexibility in sustainable agriculture. Market forces and EU integration will orient&#13;
production towards quality standards and environmental aspects in general; such a concept will be a&#13;
guiding principle in the professional advice provided by the Extension Service.&#13;
53.       The FSSP is to a large extent focused on institutional strengthening and development.&#13;
Individual components are anticipated to have a beneficial impact on the environment as follows:&#13;
(i)  the  Agriculture  Extension  Component would  enhance  the  dissemination  of&#13;
environmentally relevant knowledge through the special guidelines developed by MAF&#13;
from international and national research;&#13;
(ii)  the Applied Agriculture Research Component would allow the investigation of pressing&#13;
environmental issues related to agriculture;&#13;
(iii)  the Animal Health Component would ensure a better control of contagious and zoonotic&#13;
diseases;&#13;
(iv)  the Pasture and Fodder Development Component would contribute to better erosion&#13;
control, landscape management (reduction of maize monoculture), and more animal-&#13;
friendly husbandry practices;&#13;
(v)  the Seed Industry Development Component would by improving the regulatory&#13;
framework ensure better and more rapid access to new, disease and pest resistant plant&#13;
genetic materials already available abroad which would enhance low input practices in&#13;
crop management; through the establishment of the National Seed Authority agrochemical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX F                                          - 164 -                       Project Implementation Plan&#13;
testing and registration as well as the development of integrated pest management (IPM)&#13;
practices would be integrated into one institution thus ensuring efficient development of&#13;
regulations and procedures.&#13;
(vi)  the Policy Analysis Support Component would increase MAF's capability to follow actual&#13;
developments related to environmental issues in the agricultural sector and concerns of&#13;
decision makers in view of including these issues into appropriate legislation.&#13;
C. LAND MANAGEMENT FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE&#13;
54.       The development of Croatian agriculture to increase food and agricultural production while&#13;
meeting unsatisfied demand and recognizing the need to use environmentally friendly technologies will&#13;
carry forward into the 21st century. The main "pillars" and principles of Sustainable Land Development&#13;
(SLM)-Productivity, Security, Protection, Viability and Acceptability-(according to a Discussion&#13;
Paper of the Land and Water Development Division of FAO) are fully compatible with Croatian&#13;
conditions. It is clear that sustainable land management needs to be in the center of environmentally&#13;
sound sustainable agriculture.&#13;
55.       Implementation of FSSP will open the way to scientifically-based crop production&#13;
technologies, in particular with regard to: adequate crop rotation, integral plant nutrition systems&#13;
including plant residue management and integrated pest management system. In other words, FSSP by&#13;
our judgment opens the way to knowledge-based instead of high input-based agriculture.&#13;
56.       Experts of the extension service will need to keep in mind that quality of surface and&#13;
subsurface water resources and protection of the environment are required for the long-term sustainability&#13;
of agriculture. We consider that ideas expressed through the FSSP would support this concept. Criteria&#13;
of sustainable agricultural development and crop production would need to be defined and quantified in&#13;
the context of the aforementioned Extension Guidelines.&#13;
IV. SUMMARY STATUS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION&#13;
57.       Environmental legislation in the Republic of Croatia is not yet formed as a uniform and&#13;
systematic body of laws. However, since individual parts of this legislation are covered by laws on water&#13;
protection, agricultural land protection, forest protection etc., and these parts have a long tradition and&#13;
have been systematically developed, environmental legislation could be considered complete as a&#13;
combination of theses laws and on a regulatory level. Some parts of environment legislation are&#13;
developed on a sectoral basis (water-management, agriculture, forestry etc.).&#13;
58.       Generally, Croatian environmental legislation is characterized by the following features:&#13;
*  a variable degree of development of some parts of the legislation through a number&#13;
of bodies directly responsible for development, monitoring and implementation, and&#13;
inefficiency in enforcement and control;&#13;
*  the general character of legislation is mainly guiding, partly resulting in inefficient&#13;
implementation, and less of a restricting and obligatory nature; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation Plan                       - 165 -                                          ANNEX F&#13;
a strong legal activity related to changing the present and setting new regulations&#13;
based on constitutional prescriptions, (i.e., a need to harmonize with new social and&#13;
economic orientation of the Republic of Croatia), which means introducing modern&#13;
legislation solutions.&#13;
59.       The approach practiced in solving environmental questions is based on a broader, integrated&#13;
approach characterized by a long positive tradition of multidisciplinary work and intersectoral co-&#13;
operation, which is based not on regulations, but rather on experience. It has to be noted that, in former&#13;
Yugoslavia, issues of environment protection had been solved at the republic level, so that in the Republic&#13;
of Croatia there was continuity in improving the activities of environment protection, particularly since&#13;
the beginning of 1970s, and environment legislation had involved regulations set in the period from 1949&#13;
to present day.&#13;
60.       It can be expected that projects such as FSSP will positively influence the process of&#13;
completing and strengthening environmental legislation.&#13;
V. RELEVANT LEGISLATION FOR FSSP IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
61.       Central elements of environmental protection are covered by the Constitution of the Republic&#13;
of Croatia from 1990 which stipulates that: (i) the environment is under special protection by the State;&#13;
(ii) citizens right to a healthy life and a healthy environment are guaranteed; and (iii) citizens' right to&#13;
local self-government involves also the right to make decisions on environment protection and&#13;
improvement.&#13;
62.       The Declaration on Environment Protection in the Republic of Croatia (MN 34/92) is oriented&#13;
toward "an agriculture based on economically sustainable development...., and imposes:&#13;
"...rational soil management as an important measure, with the purpose of food&#13;
production; to be achieved by applying strong protection, by prohibiting the&#13;
reallocation of highly productive soils to non-agricultural use, especially building&#13;
purposes; by improving the lower categories of soil; by encouraging agricultural&#13;
production on fallow areas and by strictly controlling pesticide use as well as&#13;
other substances for plan protection, respectively..."&#13;
63.       Law on Environment Protection (MN982/94) prescribes a common starting point for&#13;
systematic actions in the field of environmental protection, and represent legislative starting point from&#13;
which legal solutions of particular environmental issues arise. This law consists of basic principles of&#13;
environment protection, determines creation of documents, the ways and means of implementing&#13;
environmental protection (standards, environmental impact assessment, monitoring, pollution cadastre,&#13;
information system, etc.), responsibility, control and penalties. As such, practical issues are solved&#13;
mainly by other laws and regulations.&#13;
64.       Law on Trade of Poisons (NN 53/91, 26/93, 37/94), determines a list of prohibited and&#13;
permitted poisons, classification of poisons in six classes (I to VI) and procedures for the trade of these&#13;
poisons. A new law is currently in the legislative process and is expected to be passed by Parliament&#13;
soon. The new law proposal has been developed in accordance with the WHO standards, details of which&#13;
will be further governed by new, additional regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX F                                           - 166 -                         Project Implementation Plan&#13;
65.       Law on Production. Trade and Use of Poison (NN 20/83, 47/89, 26/93, 37/94) regulates the&#13;
production of poisons and provides detailed regulations for the trade and use of poisons which are&#13;
permitted by the Law on Trade of Poisons. According to this law, the production and use of poison may&#13;
be prohibited in spite of its proper application, if it is found that it endangers the health and life of people&#13;
or damages the environment. Each plant pesticide is required to pass a prescribed procedure to obtain&#13;
permission for trade and use which is based on a number of tests as prescribed in the regulations.&#13;
66.       Law on Water (MN 53/90, 9.91, 61.91, 43/93, 75/93. 75/94), amongst other, regulates issues&#13;
of water supply, preventive water protection from pollution, and measures for decreasing water&#13;
contamination, including designing water-management plans, issuing of water-management permits,&#13;
control and penalties.&#13;
67.       Law on Spatial Planning (MN 30.94). Spatial planning arrangements have a long tradition&#13;
in the Republic of Croatia. Total space of the state - its purpose, use and conditions for protection are&#13;
determined by the Spatial Plan of the Republic of Croatia (MN 12/89) and spatial plans of municipalities.&#13;
Spatial plans are created as coordinating documents involving all basic elements of sectoral development&#13;
- for example, water-management plans, forest-management plans, traffic plans etc. All operations in&#13;
space are carried out exclusively on the basis of such spatial plans.&#13;
68.       Law on Agricultural Land (MN 54/94,  65/94).  This law prescribes basic terms of&#13;
protection, usage and reallocation of agricultural land, use over state-owned agricultural land, and control&#13;
and penalties.&#13;
69.       Law on Plant Protection (MN 10/94. 19/94) regulates in detail the protection of plants and&#13;
plant products from pests, plant health control, transport of pesticides and prevention of negative&#13;
consequence of their use on humans, animals and environment, including control and penalties.&#13;
70.       Law on livestock production improvement measures (MN 11/79, 26/93) and Law on animal&#13;
health protection and veterinary activities (MN 52/91, 26/93) determine a general framework for the&#13;
improvement of livestock production and for systematic animal health protection, (i.e., veterinary&#13;
activities).&#13;
71.       Inspection control. The public inspection activities are prescribed by a broad range of laws.&#13;
Part of the control and monitoring of FSSP implementation is carried out by environmental protection&#13;
inspection, agricultural inspection, water management inspection, veterinary inspection, plant-protection&#13;
inspection, town-planning inspection, construction inspection, and sanitary inspection.&#13;
72.       The Republic of Croatia is a signatory member to a number of international conventions on&#13;
the protection of the environment such as (i) Protocol on the Mediterranean Protection from Continental&#13;
Pollution (Barcelona Convention Protocol) regarding the Adriatic part of Croatia; (ii) Convention on the&#13;
Cooperation on the Protection and Sustainable Use of the River Danube; and (iii) Convention on&#13;
Biological Diversity Protection, which have legal precedence over national law.&#13;
73.       Regulation on the study of Environmental Impact Assessment (MN 31/84). Regulations&#13;
require an EIA for the food-processing industry, livestock and poultry farrms capacities over 500 heads,&#13;
slaughter-houses capacities over 50 head and tanneries.&#13;
74.       Law on Nature Protection (MN 30/94, 72/94) prescribes procedures for obtaining licenses&#13;
for construction works and other works on non-construction locations.&#13;
&#13;

Project Implementation Plan                         - 167 -                                          ANNEX F&#13;
75.        Regulations based on the Law on Water govern: (i) dangerous and harmful substances which&#13;
cannot be flowed or get into the water, or deposited on areas where the possibility of water pollution&#13;
exists, except under prescribed terms; water classification and categorization; terms to determine the&#13;
zones of sanitary source protection and protective measures - (Regulation on water categories [MN&#13;
15/81]); (ii) Regulations on maximal permitted concentration of danger substances in waters and coastal&#13;
see (2/84), Regulation on protective measures on terms for determining the sanitary protection variation&#13;
of fresh water sources (MN 22/86), Plan for protection of water from pollution (MN 22/86), Instruction&#13;
on record keeping on frequency of emissions of dangerous and harmful substances, their quantities and&#13;
composition, to the waters (MN 22/86).&#13;
76.        Regulations on agricultural land protection for contamination with harmful substances (MN&#13;
15/92) regulate the content of ecologically risky substances allowed, and determines how many and when&#13;
the manure can be used. The maximum tolerated contaminant content is determined by the Rule Book&#13;
on Agricultural Soil Conservation.&#13;
77.        Legislation regarding management of chemicals involves chemicals for plan protection (I I&#13;
regulations), mineral fertilizers (4 regulations) and veterinary drugs (4 regulations). These regulations&#13;
govern the protection from harmful impacts on human environment, classifications and registration,&#13;
information requirements and transport. Regulations of major importance are:&#13;
*  Law on quality, quality control an distribution of mineral fertilizers (MN 43/93)&#13;
* Regulations on Fertilizer Register and Fertilizer Declaring (MN 43/92)&#13;
*  Regulations on minimal and maximal substances and other characteristics of&#13;
particular sorts of mineral fertilizers (MN 43/92)&#13;
*  Set of sub-legal provisions regulates food protection issues - from animal control and&#13;
control of animal products, to the quality of certain kinds of food products.&#13;
78.        A modern environmental monitoring system is currently being developed encompassing all&#13;
the existing data bases, information and related services. It is a long-term project developed by the State&#13;
Directorate of Environment in cooperation with many other ministries and services envisaged to be&#13;
developed in accordance with international monitoring networks. The concept of this project is to obtain&#13;
an integrated and decentralized monitoring system. Presently, data on air, soil and water are made&#13;
available by numerous different administrative bodies, services and institutions.&#13;
79.        From  the above summary of the existing laws and regulations, the following could be&#13;
concluded with regard to the implementation of FSSP:&#13;
*  existing provisions have more of a guiding than a restrictive role;&#13;
*  the restrictions are mostly related to land use and development of a particular area,&#13;
and to some extent to the application of chemicals;&#13;
80.        Estimates of air, water and soil contamination for larger urban centers (Zagreb, Rijeka, Sisak,&#13;
Kutina)' and estimates of harmful substances emission from agriculture are carried out and generally&#13;
1/   Controlling and information cadastre system of polluters (NISO) by State Directorate of Environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX F                                           - 168 -                         Project Implementation Plan&#13;
analyzed based on produced quantities of fertilizers, consumption of fuel and lubricant for agricultural&#13;
machines, emission of harmful substances from fertilizer plants and share in liquid waste. Continuous&#13;
monitoring of harmful substances emission into the environment and of impacts caused by agricultural&#13;
production at the national level in Croatia still does not exist. According to the soil monitoring, created&#13;
within the working group for soil protection in Alps-Adria and Danube basin countries, the permanent&#13;
"monitoring" of soil, will be carried out in Croatia with the purpose of monitoring the essential soil&#13;
characteristics, particularly natural contents, anthropogene influence and ecological risky substances&#13;
balance. Soil monitoring and analysis will be carried out using standardized methods in all member-&#13;
states, which provides coordination in soil protection measures.&#13;
81.       The general environmental situation in Croatia is deemed to be satisfactory.  Some&#13;
environmental contamination, in some cases above European and World standard limits, are registered&#13;
in highly industrialized and urban areas (Zagreb, Rijeka, Sisak, Kutina). The general share of agriculture&#13;
in total emission of harmful substances is highly variable, but significantly below the level of industrial&#13;
emissions. For example, the share of exhausted nitrogen (NO) from agriculture is estimated at 15-25 %,&#13;
while share of industrial deposition is about 50%. The share of phosphorus deposition (P205) is about&#13;
10%, which is significantly less than industrial influence (60-70%). The major part of agricultural&#13;
pollution by nitrate and phosphorus related to water pollution. Estimates of Sok emission, based on total&#13;
consumption of fuel and contents of sulfur in some kinds of fuel, shows that agricultural machinery&#13;
utilization accounts for about 5 % of the total air pollution in Croatia.&#13;
82.       The relatively low levels of NO, SO,, and P04 emissions from agriculture so far are the result&#13;
of ownership structure and the economic positions of Croatian agriculture producers. Namely, the greater&#13;
part of agricultural and arable land, agricultural mechanization, as well as livestock assets are family&#13;
farm-owned, whose consumption of fertilizers and pesticides, and mechanization utilization is in most&#13;
cases considerably lower, due to its inferior economic position, limited agricultural acreage, traditional&#13;
production organization and (dis)parity of input and output prices. Even the intensive production family&#13;
farms have no particular crop or livestock capacities which could, due to their size and location on small&#13;
areas, significantly influence the increase of emission of harmful substances into environment.&#13;
83.       Currently no manual exists to guide farmers on the application, handling, and storage of&#13;
agricultural inputs, and it is recommended to include the development of such a manual within the&#13;
extension component of the FSSP.&#13;
84.       More attention should be given to the appropriate development of the role of the agriculture&#13;
extension services, as well as promotion of NGOs to introduce practical approaches to integrated and&#13;
sustainable agriculture. The role and coordination of inspection activities should be strengthened. The&#13;
regular control of soil fertility should be enforced to the extent possible.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Farmer Support Services Project will
            support the government of Croatia's agricultural policy
            by efficiently providing technology-related support services
            that are relevant to the private farmers. The aim is to
            improve the income of the private farming community and
            increase its productivity and hence the competitiveness of
            the sector. The project will address the need: 1) to change
            delivery mechanisms for the provision of technical services
            to the private farming community; and 2) for institutional
            restructuring to meet the needs of a market economy.
            Increased farmer ownership and accountability of the
            agricultural knowledge system are also essential elements of
            project design. The provision of relevant and efficient
            veterinary services and support for the shift from a
            grain-based animal production system to a lower cost
            pasture-based livestock industry are other central
            objectives. In addition, rationalizing the regulatory
            framework for the seed industry will be supported. The
            project will furthermore seek to strengthen the Ministry of
            Agriculture and Forestry's policy formulation
            capabilities and the agriculture data base in order to
            ensure more rational policy decisions in the future.
            Finally, the project consists of the six following
            components: 1) extension; 2) research; 3) animal health; 4)
            pasture and fodder development; 5) seed industry
            development; and 6) policy analysis support.
