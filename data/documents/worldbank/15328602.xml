soraewhat strange if I did not have the opportunity generally to approve&#13;

the concept of the Plan.                 As 1 said yesterday, I think                  would be inap-&#13;
&#13;
propriate for me to comment upon how the United states ought in detail at&#13;
&#13;
 least to administer the plan.                 That is not something than an international&#13;
&#13;
 organization ought to tell Congress to do, because that falls in the field&#13;
&#13;
",here the Secreta!"f of State sbould or shouldn't play, not within our pro-&#13;
