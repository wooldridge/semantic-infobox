box 1 INVESTING IN THE POOREST COUNTRIES&#13;
The International Development Association (IDA) isthe World Bank Group's concessional lending&#13;
window, which provides long-term loans at concessional rates to the poorest developing countries. The&#13;
mission of IDA is to support efficient and effective programs to reduce poverty and improve the quality&#13;
of life in the World Bank Group's poorest member countries. IDA helps build the human capital, policies,&#13;
institutions, and physical infrastructure needed to bring about equitable and sustainable growth, with&#13;
the goal of reducing disparities across and within countries and promoting equitable access to the&#13;
benefits of development.&#13;
In fiscal 2001, MIGA issued guarantees for i8 projects in IDA-eligible countries, totaling $396&#13;
million. IDA-eligible countries account for 24 percent of MIGA's current gross guarantees portfolio.&#13;
Also, 20 of the 38 countries receiving MIGAtechnical assistance are IDA-eligible.&#13;

LETTER&#13;
TO THE COUNCIL&#13;
OF GOVERNORS&#13;
James D. Wolfensohn, president of the Multilateral&#13;
Investment  Guarantee  Agency  (MIGA)  and&#13;
chairman of its Board of Directors, submits to the&#13;
Council of Governors on behalf of the Board of&#13;
Directors and in accordance with MICA's bylaws,&#13;
this report and audited financial statements for the&#13;
fiscal year endingJune 30, 2001.&#13;
Following the Council of Governors' approval of the MIGA Review 2000 report at the&#13;
October 2000 Annual Meetings in Prague, the agency has further intensified efforts in&#13;
its guarantee activities. During the past fiscal year, particular attention was paid to&#13;
priority areas that are not usually adequately supported by other investment insurers.&#13;
These priority areas are: Africa; IDA-eligible2 countries; South-South investments&#13;
(among developing countries); investments in SMEs; and complex infrastructure&#13;
projects.&#13;
Implementation of this strategy has been a success. MIGA's political risk guarantee&#13;
issuance reached a new record of $z billion in gross coverage across 66 contracts of&#13;
guaranLee. with a particular focus on the aforemnentioied prioriLy areas.&#13;
As regards the agency's technical assistance activities, in keeping with the strategic&#13;
course set forth in the MIGA Review 2000 report, the agency has increased its efforts to&#13;
improve the capacity of select developing countries' investment promotion agencies to&#13;
develop and implement investment promotion strategies. Technical assistance was&#13;
provided to 38 countries, and longer-term capacity building commitments were focused&#13;
on 28 countries where these efforts are both particularly needed and expected to pay div-&#13;
idends, in terms of attracting more foreign direct investment in the near future. Through&#13;
its information products and services, MIGA employed new technologies and tools to dis-&#13;
seminate information on investment opportunities and business operating conditions in&#13;
developing member countries.&#13;
MIGA paid its first claim at the end of fiscal 2000-and began receiving repayment&#13;
of the claim by the host country in fiscal 200l. Additionally, MICA worked with investors&#13;
and host countries to prevent claims from arising and to mediate investment disputes.&#13;
Only with an adequate capital base can MIGA continue its growth and the pursuit of&#13;
the strategic directions approved by the Council of Governors. This underscores the&#13;
importance of MIGA's General Capital Increase, approved by MlGA's Council of&#13;
Govemors.3 To date, 51 of MIGA's 154 member countries have subscribed all or a portion&#13;
of their subscription, for a total of $330 million.&#13;
I take this opportunity to urge member states to finalize their subscriptions and lead&#13;
the agency to a successful conclusion of its General Capital Increase subscription period,&#13;
which ends on March 29, 2002, 50 that the agency may continue, and even expand, its&#13;
unique and important role in supporting development.&#13;

MESSAGE FROM THE&#13;
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT&#13;
a~~~~~~~~&#13;
OVERVIEW                                                                  X&#13;
Fulfilling its mandate to facilitate productive foreign&#13;
direct investment into developing countries, MIGA             7&#13;
completed another successful year of operations,&#13;
with strong demand for all its services. We also&#13;
forged a new strategic path for the future.&#13;
In fiscal 2001, during the Annual Meetings in Prague, the Council of Governors&#13;
approved the periodic review of MIGA's activities, which is mandated by its&#13;
Convention. The "MIGA Review 2000"4 is built on the central pillars of developmental&#13;
impact, financial soundness, client orientation, and partnerships.&#13;
Based on an extensive market survey, and in an attempt to intensify MIGA's&#13;
unique role in the World Bank Group, the review gave greater emphasis to certain&#13;
"priority areas": Africa, IDA-eligible countries, South-South investments,&#13;
investments in SMEs , and complex infrastructure projects. These areas have been&#13;
identified both because of their development impact and because they are not generally&#13;
supported by other agencies or investment insurers.&#13;
In the second year of the subscription period for the General Capital Increase,&#13;
MIGA expanded its activities, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. Following the&#13;
new strategic direction, significantly more projects were insured in the priority areas.&#13;
For example, Africa-which accounts for about two percent of FDI flows into&#13;
developing countries-stands at 12 percent of MIGA's gross guarantees portfolio and&#13;
more than 13 percent of the net portfolio. To better support its efforts in Africa, MIGA&#13;
also launched a new Europe-Africa office in Paris. Further reflecting these priorities, 19&#13;
of the 28 countries receiving long-term, in-depth technical assistance for investment&#13;
promotion agencies in the past fiscal year were IDA-eligible.&#13;
MIGA also introduced a number of new products, both for investors and&#13;
investment promotion intermediaries. Most notably, we issued first-time coverage for&#13;
a water project and a performance bond (in Ecuador), and for a capital markets trans-&#13;
action (in Brazil). The agency also launched new tools for developing country&#13;
investment promotion intermediaries, such as the Investment Promotion Toolkit and&#13;
FDI Xchange.&#13;
MICA published a new, in-depth review of the development impacts of&#13;
MIGA-guaranteed projects, Investment Insurance and Development Impact-&#13;
Evaluating MIGA's Experience. The review highlights what has remained constant&#13;
throughout the changes in MIGA's environment, namely that productive foreign&#13;
direct investment is crucial to sustained growth in developing countries. To more fully&#13;
assess the effects of MIGA activities, an independent Operations Evaluation Unit was&#13;
created during the fiscal year.&#13;
vi multilateral investment guarantee agency world bank group&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
message from the executive vice president&#13;
As part of its implementation ofthe COSO exercise,5 designed to improve MIGA's&#13;
internal controls and risk management, the agency held Control Self-Assessment&#13;
workshops, in which approximately 90 percent of staff participated. Following up on&#13;
the workshops, an interdepartmental task force presented recommendations on&#13;
improving the agency's internal controls, organization, and culture; these were unani-&#13;
mously endorsed by M IGA management and are being implemented.&#13;
MIGA is now entering the third and final year of the subscription period of its&#13;
General Capital Increase, approved by the Council of Govemors in March 1999. As of&#13;
June 30, 2001, $330 million of the $850 million increase had been received, with con-&#13;
tributions from 51 member countries. The overall number of MIGAmember countries,&#13;
meanwhile, increased to 154, as Thailand and the Central African Republic completed&#13;
the membership requirements.&#13;
FISCAL 2001 SUMMARY&#13;
In fiscal 2001, MIGA issued 66 guarantees, covering 46 projects and representing $2&#13;
billion of gross issuance. After cancellations, reductions, and replacements, gross&#13;
exposure increased to nearly $5.2 billion, up 19 percent from fiscal 2000, while net&#13;
exposure stood at just under $3.2 billion, a 12 percent increase from the previous year&#13;
These MIGA-guaranteed projects are expected to facilitate $5.2 billion in FDI,&#13;
bringing the estimated cumulative amount of FDI facilitated since MIGA's inception to&#13;
more than $41 billion. This year, MIGA provided first-time coverage for projects in&#13;
Jordan, Panama, and Togo. In total, 78 developing countries have benefited from&#13;
hosting MIGA-guaranteed projects since the agency began operations.&#13;
Of particular note have been our efforts in the priority areas mentioned above.&#13;
Guarantees were issued for 18 projects in IDA-eligible countries; they now represent&#13;
3o and 24 percent of the net and gross portfolios, respectively. Eight of those 18&#13;
projects were in Sub-Saharan Africa. Twelve guarantee contracts for eight projects&#13;
were issued to investors from developing member countries (Brazil, Israel, Mauritius,&#13;
Panama, Singapore, South Africa, and Turkey). In addition, 18 investments into SMEs&#13;
were supported.&#13;
Fiscal 2001 has also been a banner year for cooperation with other investment&#13;
insurers. We mobilized $153 million in additional capacity through the CUP, while&#13;
adding five new private partners to the program. Overall, 13 private insurers have now&#13;
become MIGA CUP partners. We also engaged extensively in partnerships with&#13;
national and private providers of political risk insurance through facultative (project-&#13;
specific) reinsurance, which mobilized $602 million of capacity. Facultative rein-&#13;
surance was provided by one official insurer and nine private insurers and reinsurers.&#13;
Additionally, MIGA continued to benefit from its treaty reinsurance arrangements&#13;
with ACE and XL insurance companies. Both facultative and treaty reinsurance play a&#13;
key role in mobilizing additional investment insurance capacity for projects in&#13;
developing countries and in reducing the agency's exposure.&#13;
MIGA also worked more broadly with official insurers and development finance&#13;
institutions, especially from developing countries. We signed Memoranda of&#13;
Understanding with the People's Insurance Company of China, the Korea Export&#13;
Insurance Corporation, the Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and&#13;
Export Credit of Saudi Arabia, PricewaterhouseCoopers Deutsche Revision AG of&#13;
Germany, Finnvera of Finland, the Finanzierungsgarantie-Gesellschaft of Austria, and&#13;
multilateral investment guarantee agency war d bank group vii&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
message from the executive vice president&#13;
the Export Credit Insurance Organization of Greece. Additionally, the agency provided&#13;
training at MIGA's offices for staff of eight national insurers. The partnerships with,&#13;
and training of, investment insurers from developing countries should encourage&#13;
South-South investments, while collaboration with official finance agencies of&#13;
developed nations is expected to facilitate investments into SMEs in developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
MIGA has also worked closely with the rest of the World Bank Group to maximize&#13;
synergies and avoid overlap between various service providers. In particular, MIGA has&#13;
been closely coordinating its provisioning of technical assistance with the World&#13;
Bank/IFC's Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) to provide a "one-stop shop"&#13;
for host country clients.&#13;
MIGA strengthened its delivery of in-field technical assistance, undertaking some&#13;
59 project activities in support of FDI promotion efforts worldwide. The agency&#13;
convened the Sixth Annual African Mining Investment Symposium in Burkina Faso,&#13;
marking the first time this international event was held in Sub-Saharan Africa. This&#13;
unique event brings together interested investors from around the world and relevant&#13;
government officials from all parts of Africa.&#13;
New tools for online investment promotion, such as the FDI Xchange and&#13;
IPAworks, developed this past year, underscore the agency's role as a pioneer in using&#13;
the Internet to promote FD I flows. By providing instant e-mail notification of potential&#13;
investment opportunities to investors, FDI Xchange will enable users to immediately&#13;
link with all relevant information. In addition to completely updating its&#13;
PrivatizationLink Web site, MIGA also launched a site specifically dedicated to publi-&#13;
cizing privatizations in Russia (PrivatizationLink Russia). in a joint effort with the&#13;
Russian government and several other partners.&#13;
Having paid its first claim at the end of the previous fiscal year, M IGA continued&#13;
to work with the government of Indonesia and reached an agreement on repayment of&#13;
the claim. I am happy to report that Indonesia and the agency have been able to come&#13;
to an acceptable solution that allows the agency to reopen its services, on a case-by-case&#13;
basis, in that country.&#13;
Our legal team has also continued to provide investment dispute mediation&#13;
services to nonguarantee holders. In addition to the six successful resolutions in which&#13;
the agency has been involved since its inception, MIGA is currently working with the&#13;
government of Ethiopia to help resolve more than 70 long-standing claims by foreign&#13;
investors.&#13;
As MIGA prepares for a new fiscal year, I am confident that our innovations and&#13;
improvements-involving new products, partnerships and approaches for all of the&#13;
agency's programs-will lead to better, more effective services for our clients. As a&#13;
result, we will be able to facilitate more FDI, particularly in the priority areas, and play&#13;
our part in the fight against global poverty.&#13;

PRODUCING RESULTS&#13;
During the past year, MIGA continued to provide its&#13;
clients-investors, investment promotion intermediaries,&#13;
and the developing countries themselves-with the high-&#13;
quality products and services needed to promote FDI.&#13;
Demand for our services, including guarantees, technical&#13;
assistance, online investment promotion, and investment&#13;
dispute mediation, has never been greater. And we have&#13;
answered our clients' call-with record guarantee issuance,&#13;
especially to poorer countries, and new products that are helping them in very practical ways.&#13;
MIGA's uniqueness lies in the fact that its sole purpose is to promote productive flows&#13;
of foreign investment into developing countries. Recognizing that the environment in&#13;
which MIGA and its clients operate has been changing rapidly (and will continue to&#13;
change), the agency has focused on a host of innovative efforts-new products, part-&#13;
nerships, and approaches-designed to improve the efficacy and relevance of its&#13;
services.&#13;
These innovations are also consonant with MIGA's efforts to concentrate more&#13;
intensively on certain priority areas, such as the poorest countries (especially in Africa),&#13;
investments into SMEs, South-South investments, complex infrastructure projects,&#13;
and targeted technical assistance for those most likely to translate that assistance into&#13;
actual FDI inflows.&#13;
Despite a recent downturn in FDI into developing countries, prompted by a&#13;
slowing global economy, MIGA's guarantee program again reached new heights in&#13;
fiscal 2001. The agency issued $2 billion in protection against noncommercial risks for&#13;
46 new projects.6 Of these, i8 insured investments into SMEs, 18 were in the world's&#13;
poorest countries, eight covered projects in Africa, and eight were cross-border&#13;
investments among developing countries-helping MIGA to fulfill its mandate of facili-&#13;
tating FDI to promote economic growth in its developing member countries. These&#13;
projects are expected to account for $5.2 billion in total FDI flows, bringing the total facil-&#13;
itated by the agency since inception to an estimated $41 billion.&#13;
Notable new developments induded MIGA's first-time coverage of a capital markets&#13;
deal, a performance bond, and a water project. The year also saw MIGA offer its first&#13;
guarantees ever for ventures in Jordan, Panama, and Togo.&#13;
multilateral investment guarantee agency woldd bank g'oup 1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MIGA in focus&#13;
The agency opened a new Europe-Africa office during fiscal 2001 to support&#13;
European investors, especially with respect to investment opportunities in&#13;
developing member countries in Eastern Europe and Africa, and to collaborate&#13;
more effectively with Europe-based development agencies.&#13;
MIGA also signed seven new cooperation agreements with investment&#13;
insurance agencies and development finance institutions. It expanded its facul-&#13;
tative reinsurance and cooperative underwriting agreements, as it continued to&#13;
mobilize partners to boost the availability of political risk insurance and meet its&#13;
clients' needs. MIGA has continued its leadership role in supporting investment&#13;
promotion intermediaries in developing countries through technical assistance,&#13;
advisory services, and online investment promotion instruments.&#13;
The past year saw growing demand for MIGA's technical assistance services&#13;
from clients across all regions. MIGA's hands-on technical assistance emphasizes&#13;
the transfer of best practice in FDI promotion. It takes many different forms,&#13;
encompassing the range of services required to support investment promotion&#13;
intermediaries at all stages of development. The new Investment Promotion&#13;
Toolkit, for example, affords MIGA the opportunity to broaden its outreach by pro-&#13;
viding a foundation of information that can be used as a reference by investment&#13;
promotion intermediaries and as an adjunct to the assistance provided.&#13;
In fiscal 2001, MIGA implemented 59 technical assistance or advisory service&#13;
projects. In many cases, these projects were multifaceted efforts incorporating&#13;
strategy development, hands-on training, assistance in information technology,&#13;
and other elements of service delivery. More than half (20) of the countries&#13;
receiving technical assistance are IDA-eligible (see box i), the poorest MIGA&#13;
member countries. A significant portion of the technical assistance activities was&#13;
undertaken in cooperation with the World Bank Group's private sector units and&#13;
FIAS.&#13;
The changing nature of investment flows and the rapid evolution of Internet&#13;
technology have led MIGA to be particularly innovative in online investment pro-&#13;
motion. Tools such as PrivatizationLink and IPAworks serve the same overall goal:&#13;
to provide host country agencies with state-of-the-art instruments for attracting&#13;
investments. MIGA has also continued to develop and enhance these online&#13;
services that have earned international recognition, and which enjoy great popu-&#13;
larity with our clients. MIGA's investor information resources are utilized by more&#13;
than 25,000 people every month, many from the developing world.&#13;
MIGA pays 1st claim, signs 500th guarantee&#13;
As an insurer, MIGA stands ready to pay a valid claim when it is filed. Until&#13;
recently, however, the agency was able to use its good offices, working with&#13;
investors and host countries (by definition, MIGA members) to resolve all&#13;
potential claims situations. Paying its first claim shortly before issuing its 5ooth&#13;
guarantee highlights the value and popularity of MIGA's guarantees-and&#13;
its commitment to prudent underwriting of projects that support productive&#13;
development.&#13;
MIGA's first claim was paid at the end of the previous fiscal year for a&#13;
MIGA-guaranteed power project in Indonesia. Since that time, however, the&#13;
2  multilateral investment guarantee agency wor d ban, group&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MIGA in focus&#13;
country has begun to reimburse the agency for the $15 million claim, and MIGA is&#13;
once again offering political risk insurance coverage in Indonesia.&#13;
Shortly after the claim was paid, the issuance of MIGA's 5ooth guarantee spot-&#13;
lighted the agency's unflagging commitment to reducing poverty by facilitating FDI&#13;
into those economies investors most often ignore.&#13;
This $6i million guarantee, to Uni6n Fenosa Internacional S.A., a Spanish&#13;
investor, for a power project in Moldova, covers investments in the upgrading of three&#13;
electricity companies, which are expected to help reduce significant power shortfalls&#13;
and blackouts. The project is an important component in Moldova's efforts to reform&#13;
its energy sector.&#13;
boxz LANDMARK PROJECTS EARN HONORS&#13;
Industry experts gave top marks to MIGA's first coverage of a capital markets transaction (see p. 6) and&#13;
three other MICA-guaranteed projects in fiscal 2001, showcasing projects that stood out in their com-&#13;
plexity, innovation, and quality.&#13;
Receiving four awards was the $1.7 billion refinancing of BCP, the Brazilian mobile telecommuni-&#13;
cations company, in the region's largest telecomms deal to date. The project, guaranteed in fiscal 2ooo,&#13;
involves establishing and operating a cellular telecommunications network in the Sao Paulo metro-&#13;
politan area. It is expected to benefit some 18.5 million people. The transaction involved a diverse group&#13;
of participants, including export credit agencies, commercial banks, and public and private insurers.&#13;
Political risk insurance was the lynchpin that enabled BCP to extend its refinancing to five years.&#13;
The deal was named "Latin American Loan of the Year" by International Financing Review,&#13;
"Latin American Telecomms Deal of the Year" and "Overall Americas Deal of the Year" by Project&#13;
Finance magazine, and "Americas Telecomms Deal of the Year" by Project Finance International.&#13;
The awards were based on such criteria as difficulty of market conditions, innovativeness, and number of&#13;
players involved.&#13;
Taking home Project Finance's award for "Latin American Oil and Gas Deal of the Year' was&#13;
Barracuda, a deep-sea oil and gas production project that is expected to increase Brazil's oil production&#13;
by about i8 percent and reducethe country's reliance on imports. MIGA provided $72 million in coverage&#13;
to the project's Japanese and German sponsors and lenders, and facilitated a further $5o million in&#13;
private political risk insurance through its CUP.&#13;
The MIGA-guaranteed Julietta mining project also received accolades from Project Finance,&#13;
which named the undertaking "European Mining Deal ofthe Year." The project, the first Russian mining&#13;
deal to close in four years, received political risk insurance from MIGA in fiscal 2000.&#13;
NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES: MEETING CLIENT DEMANDS&#13;
Dramatic changes in the global economy over the past decade have produced new&#13;
opportunities and challenges for the developing world and for countries in transition&#13;
from a centrally planned economy to a market-based system. Globalization, instant&#13;
access to information via the Internet, large-scale privatization schemes and devolution&#13;
of powers from central governments to regional governments and parastatal entities&#13;
have combined to produce a far more complex, interconnected world.&#13;
multilateral investment guarantee agency world bank group  3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MIGA in focus&#13;
For investors and host countries in the developing world, the untapped opportu-&#13;
nities are enormous-but the challenges in realizing this potential are also formidable.&#13;
In addition, investor interest has traditionally focused on only a handful of countries&#13;
that currently receive the lion's share of FDI flows to the developing world. This means&#13;
that other countries must first have in place the basic legal and regulatory infra-&#13;
structure to support investments. They also need state-of-the-art tools and customized&#13;
training to spread the word to potential investors about investment opportunities in&#13;
their countries. As the investment marketplace has become more complex and&#13;
Internet-dependent, so too have the needs of host country agencies involved in&#13;
investment promotion.&#13;
Even if investors are aware of these opportunities, however, many of them may&#13;
perceive the potential noncommercial risks of a project to be too great to consider&#13;
making the investment without some sort of protection. particularly in the form of&#13;
political risk insurance. In fact, traditional political risk insurance no longer seems&#13;
fully adequate for many of the new types of investments being made now-complex&#13;
infrastructure deals, capital market transactions, privatizations in sensitive sectors&#13;
such as water, and projects involving regional governments or parastatal companies.&#13;
During the past year, MIGA has worked hard to develop and launch new products&#13;
and services that meet the changing needs of our clients and reflect the momentous&#13;
shifts in FDI flows.&#13;
Investment Marketing Services: Connecting developing countries to potential investors&#13;
MIGA has been conceptualizing, developing, and implementing new tools to help&#13;
developing country clients attract and retain FDI. One such tool is the Investment&#13;
Promotion Toolkit, which was formally launched at the Sixth Annual Conference of the&#13;
World Association of Investment Promotion Agencies (WAIPA) in Geneva in February&#13;
2ool. The nine-module toolkit is a comprehensive compilation of international best&#13;
practices in investment promotion, and represents first-hand insights gained during&#13;
MIGA's 13 years of experience providing technical assistance to emerging economies&#13;
and developing countries worldwide.&#13;
MICA developed the toolkit over an 18-month period and field-tested and revised&#13;
it according to feedback received and knowledge garnered during implementation. The&#13;
toolkit provides a valuable reference tool for sustaining investment initiatives after&#13;
completion of MIGA's formal capacity building work. The toolkit is designed for use by&#13;
a broad range of investment promotion intermediaries. Demand for the toolkit has&#13;
been tremendous: In March 2OO1, the month following its official launch, it was the&#13;
World Bank Group's best-selling publication.                                         PROMOTION&#13;
In response to burgeoning demand from users of its online services for increased   TOO L K I T&#13;
options for receiving investment information, MICA has developed the E, D I Xchla nlge,&#13;
an e-mail based update service. Piloted this year, the new service offers corporate&#13;
investors timely and specific information about direct investment opportunities&#13;
matching their expressed interests-geographic, sector, type, and size of investment-  A    s   a bld&#13;
in emerging markets worldwide.                                                       to lD PRow1"&#13;
The FDI Xchange notifies potential investors, their advisers, and financial insti-  4    ,&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MIGA in focus&#13;
sourced directly from investment promotion and privatization agencies, as well as&#13;
other qualified organizations promoting inward investment. Users of the service&#13;
*              '~: receive regular e-mail updates with links to the full text of the new investment oppor-&#13;
tunity and links to other relevant data and analysis on the specific country or sector.&#13;
Another important feature of the service is that investment promotion entities,&#13;
privatization agencies, and other content providers are able to catalogue their new&#13;
U 0        ; 0 95, i iinformation resources directly into IPAnet and the FDI Xchange through a secure&#13;
online interface. MIGA plans an intensive program of short-term assistance to these&#13;
content providers as it deploys the service.&#13;
As part of its efforts to help clients bridge the digital divide, MIGA piloted I PAworks&#13;
this past year. IPAworks is a prepackaged Web site with customizable features, created&#13;
r               *               m,+iffi- E specifically for investment promotion intermediaries that lack the in-house capability&#13;
to establish a professional Web presence. IPAworks has already been used in&#13;
W0  _i                         Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Vietnam. The leaders of&#13;
-     -c..i-...               Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City were so pleased with the IPAworks site that they have&#13;
translated the entire contents into Vietnamese and developed a sister site that can be&#13;
a,               ,,._,,.,  ,.,.  accessed by domestic investors.&#13;
Keeping pace with the rapidly developing online investment community, MIGA&#13;
this year completed the total upgrading of the PrivatizationLink Web site-&#13;
www. privatizationlink.com. Reflecting feedback on desired features and data from a&#13;
PrivatizationLink user survey and a user focus group, the new  version of&#13;
PrivatizationLink includes enhancements in site design and navigation, as well as sig-&#13;
-:    tnificant upgrades in content and functionality.&#13;
ra ,          , ".&lt;   1 nThe revamped site now offers country fact sheets detailing privatization programs&#13;
in individual countries. Another new feature is the best practice collection of reports,&#13;
Pr! -  .W,  X    studies, and articles on trends and leading-edge practices in privatization. To promote&#13;
interaction among privatization practitioners, users can provide ratings and written&#13;
feedback on the content presented.&#13;
Furthermore, the new version includes a Practitioners' Corner, designed to&#13;
support those involved in structuring transactions and containing a collection of&#13;
hands-on learning and networking resources, and an Investors' Coiner, which users&#13;
can personalize to monitor the investment and advisory opportunities according to&#13;
their sector or geographic interests.&#13;
For almost two years, MIGA has been working with the Russian government to&#13;
gather and publish information on the state privatization program online. These efforts&#13;
culminated with the launch of PrivatizationLink Russia-russia.privatizationlink.com-&#13;
in October 2000. PrivatizationLink Russia is a joint initiative of MIGA, the government&#13;
of Russia, and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), and is also&#13;
supported by the World Bank. It is designed to make information on privatization in&#13;
Russia more transparent and accessible. For the first time, investors have instant, free&#13;
access to business profiles of state-owned companies and assets currently for sale in the&#13;
Russian Federation, along with details on the laws, regulations, and procedures&#13;
goveming these transactions.&#13;
Guarantees: Pioneering new insurance tools, entering new markets&#13;
MIGA also developed new products to meet the changing needs of its guarantee&#13;
clients. In a move that broke new ground for financing in developing countries, MIGA&#13;
multilateral investment guarantee agency world bank group 5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
MIGA in focus&#13;
issued a $90 million guarantee for the securitization of loan and lease receivables from&#13;
the financing of medical equipment in Brazil. The deal marked several important&#13;
firsts, including MIGA's initial foray into capital markets coverage, as well as Brazils&#13;
first internationally rated securitization of medical equipment receivables.&#13;
MIGA issued the guarantee to MSF Funding LLC, which will use the financing&#13;
proceeds to originate new loans and leases in Brazil, where specialized medical&#13;
equipment-such as MRI and CT scanners-is in short supply, and much of what&#13;
exists is obsolete.&#13;
MIGA proved key to improving the risk profile of the notes and helping&#13;
the investor secure the financing needed. The Class A Notes received an A2 rating from&#13;
Moody's Investor Services and an A rating from S&amp;P and Fitch IBCA. According&#13;
to Moody's Investor Services, the ratings assigned exceeded Brazils B2 rating because&#13;
of MIGA's presence. The deal also received top honors from Structured Finance&#13;
International magazine, which named it the year's "Best Securitisation of Emerging&#13;
Market Assets."&#13;
With the signing of an $18 million guarantee for a project to provide potable and&#13;
sanitary water services in Guayaquil, Ecuador, MIGA crossed two other important&#13;
thresholds. The guarantee marked the agency's first coverage of a water utilities&#13;
investment and ofa performance bond.&#13;
The guarantee covers an investment to privatize and upgrade municipal water&#13;
services, as well as a performance bond posted by the company for the operating con-&#13;
cession. The bond guarantees the company's delivery of specified services-successful&#13;
management, expansion, and operation of the water services-within the concession&#13;
time period. MIGA's guarantee protects against the wrongful call of the bond. The&#13;
coverage resulted from MIGA's ongoing quest to provide the right products and&#13;
services to meet client needs.&#13;
box 3 NEW PUBLICATIONS FOCUS ON RANGE OF MIGA ACTIVITIES&#13;
To bring MIGA's experiences to a wider audience and promote greater transparency, the agency peri-&#13;
odically publishes detailed accounts of activities in which it is involved, including information on its&#13;
cooperation with other entities that facilitate FDI, the impact of its various activities, and the&#13;
methodologies it employs.&#13;
This year MIGA published two books, Investment Insurance and Developmental&#13;
Impacts: Evaluating MIGA's Experience and International Political Risk Management:&#13;
Exploring New Frontiers. It also released "MIGA Review 2000," which outlines future priorities&#13;
and strategic directions for the agency. These can all be ordered from World Bank Publications at&#13;
books@worldbank.org, or through MIGA's Web site (www.miga.org), where readers can also order&#13;
MIGA's Investment Promotion Toolkit, discussed above.&#13;
Investment Insurance and Developmental Impacts: Evaluating MIGA's Experience&#13;
shares thefindings of MIGA's evaluation workwith the interested public. ltfocuses on evaluations of&#13;
52 projects guaranteed by MIGA from fiscal 199i-96, and finds that the projects generally met or&#13;
exceeded their anticipated developmental impacts. In fact, the projects evaluated facilitated $7.1&#13;
billion in investment-$S.3 billion more than investors had initially expected to invest when they&#13;
insured their projects with MIGA. Those same 52 projects also directly created more than 15,500&#13;

MICA in focus&#13;
jobs, often in areas of high unemployment or underemployment. Other important effects include&#13;
increased tax revenues and exports, as well as environmental benefits and training for local workers.&#13;
The book is especially useful to readers seeking to better understand how private FDI contributes to&#13;
the development process, as well as for those interested in the methodology of developmental&#13;
impact analysis.&#13;
International Political Risk Management: Exploring New Frontiers examines transfor-&#13;
mations in the political risk insurance market in the 1ggos that resulted from changes in the broader&#13;
insurance industry and from the rapid and complex expansion of FDI into emerging markets. It&#13;
brings together the views and experiences of those who shaped the industry in the past decade-&#13;
as academics and practitioners from the international investor, lender, and insurance communities.&#13;
The book is a valuable guide for those considering private sector investments and privatizations in&#13;
the developing world, as well as for independent analysts and scholars in the field of political risk&#13;
management.&#13;
"MIGA Review 2000" is the agency's newest five-year review, which is mandated by Article 67&#13;
of MIGA's Convention. This strategy paper reviews MGA's activities over the past five years, analyzes&#13;
key elements of its external operating environment, and develops detailed future strategic directions&#13;
for the agency. The "multi-niche" strategy described in the paper focuses MIGA on opportunities&#13;
which only it can serve, orwhich would not be realized without MIGA's involvement.&#13;
NEW PARTNERSHIPS: WORKING TOGETHER FOR DEVELOPMENT&#13;
From its earliest days, MIGA has known that, as a relatively small multilateral insti-&#13;
tution, its ability to deliver the greatest potential impact for developing countries must&#13;
lie in fostering relations with a variety of partners. This is true for both the guarantees&#13;
program and for the agency's technical assistance services. The result has been&#13;
dynamic relations with private and public institutions-relations that grow deeper and&#13;
broader every year.&#13;
Sometimes the best synergies are found closest to home. In this vein, MIGA has&#13;
been working more closely than ever with other members of the World Bank Group&#13;
to ensure that its activities are well coordinated and serve the common goal of&#13;
reducing poverty. This includes the joint preparation of country assistance strategies&#13;
and evaluations, as well as collaboration on a project-specific basis, with IFC and the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
More partners = More FDI flows&#13;
MIGA's guarantees program has continued to develop partnerships on all fronts. We&#13;
are proud to have the most far-reaching network of private partners of any public&#13;
investment insurer. In addition, MIGA has been pioneering hands-on assistance for&#13;
the growing number of public investment insurers in developing countries,&#13;
responding to their interest in promoting greater FDI flows within the developing&#13;
world.&#13;
During the year, MIGA signed seven Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with&#13;
export credit agencies and international financial institutions: the Islamic&#13;
Corporation for the Insurance of Investments and Export Credit (ICIEC) of Saudi&#13;
Arabia, Austria's finance and guarantee agency (FGG), Finland's export credit agency&#13;

Deutsche Revision of Germany, the Export Credit Insurance Organization (ECIO) of&#13;
Greece and the Korea Export Insurance Corporation (KEIC). This brings the total&#13;
number of such partners to 18.&#13;
These partnerships allow MIGA to strengthen cooperation and complement oper-&#13;
ations with the national entities of member countries, with a view to maximizing the&#13;
efficiency of respective services. They also allow for cooperation in coinsurance and&#13;
reinsurance and for jointly providing an array of services to investors. For investors,&#13;
this collaboration mobilizes increased political risk insurance coverage for longer&#13;
periods of time, and allows MIGA to provide a one-stop service to meet all guarantee&#13;
needs. For insurers, these partnerships offer the added comfort of M IGA's involvement&#13;
in underwriting and in the event of a dispute or claim.&#13;

MIGA also added five new partners, including four Lloyd's Syndicates, to its&#13;
Cooperative Underwriting Program (CUP). The CUP is an arrangement wherein&#13;
MIGA is the insurer-of-record but retains only a portion of the exposure, with the&#13;
remainder underwritten by one or more private insurers. The product was designed to&#13;
encourage private insurers to enter transactions that they may not have felt comfortable&#13;
undertaking alone.&#13;
Another increasingly important aspect of partnership is the training MIGA&#13;

Last year, MIGA conducted two training programs, attracting participants from&#13;
eight countries (Austria, Denmark, Italy, Kuwait, Malaysia, Panama, Saudi Arabia, and&#13;
Thailand). The programs included sessions on country risk analysis, contract drafting,&#13;
sector-specific underwriting, and online information services on investment opportu-&#13;
nities in developing countries. This training has enabled attendees to not only liaise&#13;
with MIGA and the rest of the World Bank Group but also to get better acquainted with&#13;
other insurers.&#13;
Forging alliances for improved investment promotion&#13;
Similar collaboration was evidenced in the new technical assistance initiative announced&#13;
at the May 2001 Conference on Least Developed Countries (LDC III) in Brussels. A&#13;
cooperative effort among MIGA, FIAS, the United Nations Conference on Trade and&#13;
Development (UNCTAD), and the United Nations Industrial Development&#13;
Organization (UNIDO), the initiative is known as the Multi-Agency Technical&#13;
Assistance Programme. Under the Programme, participating agencies will provide&#13;
advice and services covering the full range of policies and activities needed to create an&#13;
attractive environment and promote inward FDI to selected pilot countries. In each&#13;
country, collaborating agencies will conduct a needs assessment and supporting inves-&#13;
tigations required to define the specific elements of the work program. From this&#13;
assessment, a tailored set of objectives, scope of work, implementation plan, and antic-&#13;
ipated outcomes will be established, and a detailed cost estimate and collaborative&#13;
program schedule will be prepared, in partnership with the client country.&#13;

Collaborating with other World Bank Group members&#13;
MIGA has made significant progress in implementing a systematic approach to ensure&#13;
that foreign investment-related issues play an appropriate role in the World Bank&#13;
Group's country and overall development strategies.&#13;
In a joint initiative with the World Bank, MIGA is studying of the role of political&#13;
risk insurance in fostering FDI into conflict-affected countries. Two case studies are&#13;
being written on Bosnia and Herzegovina and Mozambique, and will be finalized in&#13;
the next fiscal year&#13;
Coordination with IFC in the field has also strengthened considerably, most notably&#13;
in Asia and Africa. Special arrangements were made with IFC to market MIGA's&#13;
activities in South Asia and Southern Africa. In India, a local IFC staff member has&#13;
been marketing MIGA's activities on a part-time basis, and in South Africa,&#13;
arrangements have been made for a MIGA staff tnember to market the agency's&#13;
services with IFC's logistical support. The South African initiative has already started&#13;
to foster closer relationships with new and existing clients, and has brought about a&#13;
better awareness of MJGA's activities in the region.&#13;

NEW APPROACHES: STRATEGIC DECISIONS, BETTER OUTCOM ES&#13;
Perhaps the most difficult undertaking any institution or corporation can engage in is to&#13;
think differently about how it reaches for its goals. After soliciting input through external&#13;
and internal reviews, MICA began to make some strategic decisions during the past year&#13;
that have already produced favorable results and should have a profound longer-term&#13;
effect on how we can most effectively deliver on our developmental mandate.&#13;
MIGA Review 2000 provides an in-depth description of this new strategy. Its three&#13;
main conclusions should be underscored. First, the agency will concentrate on certain&#13;
priority areas: the poorest countries, especially in Africa; investments into SMEs;&#13;
coverage for investments among developing countries; complex infrastructure&#13;
projects; and technical assistance to those most likely to translate that help into FDI&#13;
flows in the medium term. Since most of these are frontier areas, special efforts and&#13;
new approaches are needed.&#13;
Second, the agency will take measures, through internal and external controls,&#13;
that ensure its operational effectiveness and measure how well it is actually doing in&#13;
fulfilling its mandate. Finally, the review and the COSO self-risk assessment exercise&#13;
both suggested that the agency could improve its internal operations by better&#13;
capturing synergies between departments (see p. vii).&#13;
Catalyzing agency-wide synergy to spur African investment&#13;
Over the past year, MIGA has worked to catalyze FDI flows to Africa by maximizing&#13;
synergy from an agency-wide collaborative effort. The focus has been on selected&#13;
countries that offer prospects for significant new business. In October 2000, a&#13;
strategy for this pilot program was defined and is now operational.&#13;
MIGA's field representation has recently been augmented by a part-time special&#13;
representative based in Nairobi, Kenya, as well as MIGA's Europe-Africa outreach&#13;
office in Paris. Ghana, Mozambique, Senegal, and Tanzania were selected as the pilot&#13;
countries and an interdepartmental team was designated to develop programs for&#13;
each of them. Country selection criteria included the potential to attract higher FDI&#13;
flows in the near future and to benefit the most from MIGA's technical assistance&#13;
activities.&#13;
In addition to these efforts, Promote Africa (MIGA's field function with offices in&#13;
Lom6, Togo and Windhoek, Namibia, and other regional representatives) will continue&#13;
to strengthen business involvement with partners from outside the region.&#13;
In Ghana, efforts have been made to increase awareness of MIGA's guarantee&#13;
service, and agency representatives have met with authorities from the new gov-&#13;
ernment on an upcoming review of the country's investment promotion structure and&#13;
MIGA's potential assistance in this process.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
MIGA in focus&#13;
Following up on FIAS recommendations for the establishment of a new&#13;
investment promotion agency in Senegal, MIGA, in conjunction with the World Bank,&#13;
has developed a five-year strategy for that country's agency that will be submitted for&#13;
funding to the Bank's Board of Directors. A MIGA mobile office visited Senegal in&#13;
March 2001.&#13;
In Mozambique, MIGA has identified support needs in investment promotion to&#13;
develop a program for donor consideration, and support has already been tentatively&#13;
identified.&#13;
Finally, for Tanzania, tourism and tourism-related infrastructure have been iden-&#13;
tified as promising recipients of FDI. A fast-track initiative in the tourism sector, com-&#13;
prising a stakeholder workshop leading to an investor roundtable, has been agreed to&#13;
with government authorities and local business leaders. On the basis of a review of the&#13;
Tanzania Investment Centre and discussions with donors. MIGA developed a&#13;
capacity building program to support the Centre's restructuring.&#13;
Reaching our clients: New places ...&#13;
MIGA expanded its client outreach efforts in fiscal 2001 through a new Paris-based&#13;
office, complementing its field representation in Tokyo, Bosnia, Southern and East&#13;
Africa, and Switzerland. The new office is part of the agency's efforts to increase the&#13;
level of FDI from Europe into developing countries, particularly those in Africa and&#13;
Eastern Europe.&#13;
During its first six months, the office has focused on facilitating the underwriting&#13;
of new projects, especially those involving SMEs, following up on work initiated in a&#13;
satellite office in Switzerland. In addition, the office is developing new partnerships&#13;
with bilateral development organizations and stakeholders, as well as member country&#13;
governments represented in Europe.&#13;
MIGA also had a field presence, financed by the Policy and Human Resource&#13;
Development Fund of Japan. in Southern and West Africa. Likewise, the Promote&#13;
Africa program afforded new opportunities for MIGA to develop and utilize rela-&#13;
tionships with regional partners in support of outreach and marketing efforts ini-&#13;
tiated in Washington. A special representative in a staff exchange program with the&#13;
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and with the Nairobi-&#13;
based African Trade Insurance Agency (ATI), worked with regional private sector&#13;
and government representatives to promote the use of guarantees as a means of&#13;
attracting FD I.&#13;
Funded by the European Union (EU), a staff member based in Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina continued the agency's collaboration with the European Commission on&#13;
the joint guarantee trust fund, a partnership begun in 1997 to promote FDI in the&#13;
formerly war-torn country.&#13;
MIGA's representative for Asia, based in Tokyo and funded by the Miyazawa&#13;
Initiative,' helped to develop and administer missions from headquarters to the&#13;
region.&#13;
In addition to its more permanent field offices, MIGA conducted road shows and&#13;
visits around the world as part of its mobile office program. The effort featured seminars&#13;
and meetings on MIGA's activities in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and North&#13;
Africa, Southeast Europe and West Africa. This outreach has enabled MIGA to raise its&#13;

New unit to better evaluate M IGA's development effectiveness&#13;
Since MIGA is first and foremost a development agency, one of the most important&#13;
questions that it must always address is: What is the developmental impact of MIGA's&#13;
activities, both at the aggregate and project levels?&#13;
From the beginning, MIGA has sought to estimate the developmental impacts of&#13;
prospective guarantee projects. An evaluation framework has evolved, with MIGA&#13;
reporting its findings to the Board of Directors and to the broader public (see box 3).&#13;
Evaluation staff also provide input into the guarantee process on whether a given&#13;
project will likely have a beneficial developmental impact in the host country.&#13;
Evaluation officers and other staff undertake onsite evaluations of a significant pro-&#13;
portion of MIGA-guaranteed projects,8 once these have had sufficient time to&#13;
become operational, to see whether the impacts are actually meeting initial expec-&#13;
tations; in many cases, the developmental impact was found to significantly exceed&#13;
initial estimates.&#13;
The next step in the evolution of MIGA's evaluation efforts was taken at the&#13;
beginning of fiscal 2001: A separate Operations Evaluation Unit was established. The&#13;
unit's mandate has been extended to cover not only the evaluation of guarantees oper-&#13;
ations, but also of MIGA's advisory and technical services. The institutionalization of&#13;
an independent evaluation function within MIGA will enhance the objectivity,&#13;
accountability, and feedback of evaluation findings. The unit will be able to work more&#13;
closely with other parties, both within the World Bank Group and externally, that&#13;
evaluate developmental impacts; this will add further depth and breadth to MIGA's&#13;
evaluation efforts.&#13;

box4 LOOKING BACK-SPAIPA&#13;
Frequently, MIGA-guaranteed projects have direct and indirect developmental impacts far beyond what&#13;
the investors initially anticipated when applying for a MIGA guarantee and beyond requirements of local&#13;
authorities. These impacts, often discovered during project evaluation site visits, frequently go&#13;
unheralded because they are usually not captured by standard assessment techniques.&#13;
A MIGA-guaranteed soft drink bottling project in Brazil, which has acted as a good corporate&#13;
citizen and undertaken extensive efforts to foster recycling, is a good example of such effects. SPAI PA&#13;
S/A - INDUSTRIA BRASILEIRA DE BEBIDAS (SPAIPA - S5o Paulo Interior e Parana), Brazil's third-&#13;
largest soft drink bottler and distributor, operates in the states of Parana and S5o Paulo, primarily in the&#13;
city of Curitiba.&#13;
In 1996, SPAIPA benefited from three MIGA guarantees totaling $20.25 million, covering&#13;
investments by Gribal S.A. of Uruguay as well as loans provided by Lloyds TSB Bank plc and BankBoston&#13;
to expand the company's operations. The total investment in the expansion was $69 million.&#13;
That same year, SPAIPA and local recycler LATASA launched a recycling program that has served as&#13;
a model for other bottlers and has had significant positive impacts on the local communities. Reflecting&#13;
the innovative approach of both SPAIPA and Curitiba to environmental issues, SPAIPA also developed a&#13;
highly maneuverable, electric cargo-handling vehicle, called "Ecocargo," that is now being used for dis-&#13;
tributing drinks in densely populated urban areas.&#13;
SPAI PA became the first bottler in Brazil to initiate a partnership with local schools, LATASA and&#13;
the government ofParang. InJune1996, it launched the Escola (School) program in Curitiba, and quickly&#13;
expanded it to cover three other cities (Maringa, Aracatuba, and S5o Jose do Rio Preto). Currently, more&#13;
than 1,goo institutions with 300,000 students participate.                                           photos I left,aSPAIPAemployeecol-&#13;

When a school enrolls in the program, SPAIPA employees visit the school and explain the program&#13;
and the environ mental benefits of recycling. This meshes with efforts by the governments of ParanA state&#13;
and the city of Curitiba to promote environmental awareness from the earliest possible age.&#13;
SPAIPA's ongoing, innovative efforts are not only contributingto a better environment in S5o Paulo&#13;
and Parana states, but also to a better understanding of environmental issues, particularly among the&#13;
segment of society that will be most affected by those issues: the area's children. In addition, through&#13;
their participation in the program, these children are contributing to improving their schools by earning&#13;
much-needed equipment for their institutions. 9&#13;

"When I joined the Bank on August i, 1983, as general counsel, I was&#13;
convinced that the need for an international agency to encourage&#13;
foreign investment was greater than ever. Such investment not only&#13;
was concentrated in a few countries; its volume had started an his-&#13;
torical decline. An agency supported by the World Bank and&#13;
receivingthe full confidence of both capital exporting and importing&#13;
countries could, in my view at the time, reverse that trend to the&#13;

memoriam&#13;
benefit of both sides. In particular, it could play a significant role by&#13;
rebuilding confidence in investing in developing countries and by&#13;
breaking the psychological barrier that magnified political risks...&#13;
The basic objective of the newly projected agency, to which I gave&#13;
the name of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency was&#13;
described in terms ofencouraging and promoting the flow of private&#13;
resources among members for productive purposes." lS&#13;

DR. IBRAHIM SHIHATA&#13;
1937-2001&#13;
This year, MIGA mourns the loss of one of its most&#13;
important founding fathers, Dr. Ibrahim Shihata, whose&#13;
inspiration, courage, and determination were instru-&#13;
mental in the agency's founding. We remember a man of&#13;
vision who left a profound legacy in his native Egypt, in the Middle East, at the World Bank, and for MIGA.&#13;
At a very young age, Dr. Shihata emerged as one of the most brilliant legal minds from&#13;
the developing world, He achieved national acclaim in Egypt after graduating from the&#13;
Cairo University and Harvard Law School. He was both an intellectual, teaching law,&#13;
and a successful practitioner of law. He was the legal architect of some of the most far-&#13;
reaching and significant economic developments in the Middle East in the 197os. His&#13;
efforts came during a tumultuous time, when much of the world's wealth shifted&#13;
almost overnight to the oil-producing countries. Dr. Shihata's vision was clear: this vast&#13;
wealth had to be shared, and shared equitably. This was the basis for his determination&#13;
to design and create institutions necessary to engineer the distribution of wealth.&#13;
In 1983, he was appointed Vice President and General Counsel of the World Bank,&#13;
the first-ever from a developing country. As a result of his indefatigable efforts, in 1985,&#13;
the Convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency was&#13;
opened for signature. With Dr. Shihata playing an important shepherding role, sur-&#13;
mounting a variety of obstacles and forging important compromises among stake-&#13;
holders, MIGA commenced operations in 1988.&#13;
MIGA's staff is grateful to him for his creative spirit, convictions, and perse-&#13;
verance. In many ways, MIGA's creation was the embodiment of Dr. Shihata's&#13;
vision. In a broader context, the operations of the agency have improved the lives of&#13;
thousands of poor people in developing countries, linking their destinies to his ini-&#13;
tiative and courage. For MIGA, his outstanding contributions shall forever remain&#13;
a legacy.&#13;
"Interestingly, the major problem MIGA seems to be facing now,&#13;
contrary to the initial expectations of many, is that demand for its&#13;
services by far exceeds its capacity to supply it in full."&#13;

INSURING INVESTMENTS, ENSURING OPPORTUNITIES&#13;
Innovation, flexibility, outreach to clients and partners.&#13;
These are the hallmarks of MIGA's guarantees&#13;
program, which in fiscal 2001 forged a strategic path&#13;
focused on promoting investment into the world's&#13;
poorest countries, in Africa, among developing countries, and in small and medium-size enterprises.&#13;
This was a path that led to positive results. Fiscal 2001 yielded 66 contracts of guarantee&#13;
in 28 developing member countries, for an all-time high in coverage. The increase in&#13;
contracts reflects an effort to underwrite smaller projects with a high developmental&#13;
impact. These results are also a solid indication of MIGA's commitment to using&#13;
investment guarantees to encourage FDI-and ultimately improve people's lives and&#13;
reduce poverty.&#13;
GUARANTEES REACH RECORD N UM BERS WHILE PRIORITY AREAS SEE PROGRESS&#13;
MIGA's guarantee coverage once again struck new heights, reaching $2 billion&#13;
in fiscal 2001 and offering protection against political risks for investments in&#13;
28 developing countries. This represents a 25 percent increase in the amount of&#13;
coverage over the previous year. This number grows to $2.15 billion when con-&#13;
sidering amounts covered by other insurers through the CUP (see box 6). The out-&#13;
standing portfolio at the end of the year was $5.2 billion before reinsurance and net&#13;
of cancellations (see figure 4). Net premium income, fees, and commissions totaled&#13;
$36.5 million.&#13;
MIGA issued first-time guarantees for projects in Jordan, Panama, and Togo as&#13;
it worked to fulfill its goal of regional diversification and to reach countries that have&#13;
not been significant beneficiaries of FDI. Efforts to promote South-South&#13;
investments-those among developing countries-also bore fruit: 12 guarantees&#13;
were issued to investors from Brazil, Israel, Mauritius, Panama, Singapore, South&#13;
Africa, and Turkey for investments in Brazil, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, Mozambique,&#13;
Nicaragua, and Vietnam.&#13;

Angola, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Vietnam (one&#13;
each). Contracts issued for these projects accounted for 24 percent of MIGA's fiscal year&#13;
gross issuance (see box i).&#13;
box 5 WHAT IS THE GUARANTEES PROGRAM?&#13;
In today's interconnected global economy, businesses increasingly recognize that investment opportu-&#13;
nities exist in emerging economies. But for multinational companies and small and medium-size busi-&#13;
nesses alike, concerns about uncertain policy environments and perceptions of political risk often inhibit&#13;
investment. As a result, FDI tends to go to a handful ofcountries, leavingtheworld's poorest economies&#13;
largely ignored and many attractive investment opportunities unexplored. MIGA's guarantees program&#13;
works to address these concerns by offering political risk insurance to investors.&#13;
Through its investment guarantees, MIGA offers protection against four types of noncommercial&#13;
risk associated with FDI: currency inconvertibility and transfer restrictions, expropriation, war and civil&#13;
disturbance, and breach of contract. Guarantees are available for many types of investments going into&#13;
developing member countries, such as new cross-border investments, multicountry projects, as well as&#13;
expansions and privatizations ofexisting projects. In the pastyear, MIGA also issued coverage for capital&#13;
markets transactions and performance bonds for the first time.&#13;
The agency's top-rated insurance has many other benefits, allowing investors and lenders to&#13;
venture into new markets with confidence and potentially achieve investment grade ratings or higher for&#13;
emerging market securities. Financial institutions also benefit by being able to leverage their country&#13;
limits and thus reduce country risk provisioning and transaction costs.&#13;

EFFORTS CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY PORTFOLIO&#13;
At the sectoral level, MIGA's portfolio saw some modest distribution shifts (see figure&#13;
5). In terms of gross coverage, oil and gas projects showed the largest increase, growing&#13;
from 2 percent of the portfolio in fiscal 2000 to 5 percent in fiscal 2001. The&#13;
agribusiness and financial sectors also claimed a larger portfolio share, with coverage&#13;
climbing by 2 percent for each. Coverage for the mining, manufacturing, and services&#13;
sectors decreased slightly, while infrastructure and tourism stayed just about even.&#13;
Change was also visible when it came to subsectors. A shift in gross coverage for&#13;
financial projects reflected the agency's push to support mortgages and loans intended&#13;
primarily for SMEs, as well as MIGA's landmark coverage for a securitization deal of&#13;
loan and lease receivables in Brazil. Within infrastructure, the transportation subsector&#13;
also grew, increasing from just o.i percent of gross coverage in fiscal 2000 to more&#13;
than 2 percent of the total.&#13;
Likewise, a glance at the regional distribution of MIGA's portfolio would probably&#13;
not reveal some of the important changes going on beneath the surface. For years,&#13;
Latin America has accounted for a large share of the portfolio, and at 57 percent in fiscal&#13;
2001 continued to do so. But within the region, Central America and the Caribbean&#13;
have grown and now total nearly 12 percent of the agency's gross coverage, with new&#13;
projects being insured in countries such as the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and&#13;
Nicaragua.&#13;
The agency's gross exposure in Africa stayed even at 12 percent, but the number of&#13;
contracts and projects both grew, reflecting an ongoing effort to support smaller&#13;
investments in the region. MIGA's commitment is clearly demonstrated by its&#13;
issuance of 15 contracts for eight projects in Angola, Guinea, Mozambique, Tanzania,&#13;
Togo, and Zambia. In fact, Tanzania and Mozambique are now the eighth- and ninth-&#13;
largest countries in MIGA's portfolio, respectively, and together account for 6.7 percent&#13;
of gross exposure.&#13;
Even though Asia claimed a smaller share of the gross portfolio in fiscal 2001,&#13;
coverage there grew in absolute terms. The agency insured two important projects in&#13;
the region, including a large infrastructure project in the Philippines and telecommu-&#13;
nications project in Vietnam. The Middle East and North Africa, too, saw an increase in&#13;
representation, nearly doubling its share of MIGA's portfolio with the Jordan potash&#13;
project.&#13;

Coverage was also strong in Europe and Central Asia, where MIGA issued&#13;

Republic, Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, and the Slovak Republic.&#13;
DEMAND INCREASES AS REGIONALAWARENESS GROWS&#13;
This progress was due in part to the agency's ongoing series of in-depth regional visits,&#13;
known as its "mobile office" program. In fiscal 2001, MIGA conducted seminars and&#13;
meetings in Asia, Latin America, Southeastem Europe. and West Africa. This outreach&#13;
has enabled MIGA to raise its profile and bring about a better awareness of its activities&#13;
among stakeholders and members of various local business communities, and has&#13;
been particularly helpful in promoting investments among developing countries.&#13;
During a visit to the West African countries of Mali, Senegal, and Ghana, MIGA&#13;
staff listened to many high-level government officials and business representatives&#13;
discuss local investment priorities and challenges. The key message coming out of the&#13;
trip was that investment needs to be stepped up for West Africa to develop its full&#13;
potential, and MIGA is well placed to bring more foreign investors and local businesses&#13;
together. In addition to the consultation, the group visited project sites sponsored&#13;
by MIGA and IFC to get a first-hand look at the business operating and investment&#13;
environment.&#13;
An agency trip to East Asia and the Pacific Rim took staff experts to eight&#13;
countries-Australia, Cambodia, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines,&#13;
Singapore, and Thailand-to talk about the value of political risk insurance for&#13;
investments in the region and elsewhere. In addition to formal seminars, staff met&#13;
with representatives of financial institutions, potential investors, and those involved in&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
guarantees program&#13;
promoting investment opportunities. The trip was particularly timely, given persistent&#13;
investor concerns in the wake of the financial crisis, as well as untapped business&#13;
opportunities in the region, as in Thailand, MIGA's newest member country. One of&#13;
the trip's focal points was to promote South-South investments.&#13;
A mobile office to Central America and Colombia provided another platform for&#13;
getting the word out about MICA and its services. The trip came at a good time, given&#13;
the regions emergence from a two-year recession spawned by the backlash from the&#13;
global financial crisis of the late 1ggos. Agency staff held seminars on guarantee&#13;
products for potential investors in Barranquilla, Colombia, and in Guatemala City. In&#13;
addition, MIGA representatives met one-on-one with investors and companies in those&#13;
countries as well as in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. One&#13;
of the missiorns focal points was to promote investments among developing countries.&#13;
Follow-up meetings have produced cooperation arrangements to support business&#13;
development in the region.&#13;
MIGA completed its outreach activities for the fiscal year with a series of seminars&#13;
and meetings on the West Coast of the United States and in Greece, Italy, Spain, and&#13;
Slovenia.&#13;
The strong support MIGA received from  IFC during many of these trips under-&#13;
scores the close working relationship the agency has developed with the World Bank&#13;
Group on private sector development.&#13;

AGENCY LEVERAGES ITS COVERAGE&#13;
During the fiscal year, MIGA's reinsurance, coinsurance, and trust funds allowed it to&#13;
leverage its own coverage to serve more clients, both investors and host countries.&#13;
Reinsurance and coinsurance Reinsurance continued to be important in reducing the&#13;
agency's exposure to loss, as well as allowing MIGA to encourage private sector&#13;
insurers to participate in transactions with a positive developmental impact they would&#13;
probably not insure otherwise. MIGA's resolution of its first claim ever has greatly rein-&#13;
forced partners' confidence in its ability to avoid losses by recovering claims and in the&#13;
value of the "MIGA franchise."&#13;
Important transactions in fiscal 2001 were supported under the CUP and facul-&#13;
tative (per project) reinsurance programs. These include an oil and gas project in Brazil&#13;
that combined a CUP agreement with Chubb and facultative reinsurance by the Lloyd's&#13;
market; the completion of a gold mine transaction in Tanzania, which constituted the&#13;
biggest MIGA facultative reinsurance project to date; a manufacturing project in&#13;
Jordan, for which MIGA concluded its first facultative reinsurance contract with&#13;
Finnvera of Finland and in which the European Investment Bank and the Islamic&#13;
Development Bankacted as lenders; and coverage of a loanby Banco Santander Central&#13;
Hispano to support medium-term financing of SMEs by Banco Galicia in Argentina,&#13;
for which MIGA concluded its first facultative reinsurance agreement with AIG.&#13;
box 6 WHAT IS THE COOPERATIVE UNDERWRITING PROGRAM?&#13;
In 1996, MIGA created a special product to encourage private insurers to offer political risk coverage for&#13;
projects in developing member countries where insurers may not have been comfortable or willing to&#13;
offer insurance on their own. Through the CUP, MIGA helps allay insurer concerns by acting as the&#13;
insurer-of-record and issuing a contract of guarantee for the entire amount of insurance requested by an&#13;
investor, but retaining only a portion of the exposure. The remainder is underwritten by one or more&#13;
private insurers. The premium rates, claims payments, and recoveries are all shared on a proportional&#13;
basis.&#13;

Bosnia and Herzegovina Trust Fund In partnership with the European Commission,&#13;
MIGA established the EU Investment Guarantee Trust Fund for Bosnia and&#13;

placed in Sarajevo to raise awareness about MIGA among foreign investors. The&#13;
representative also played a role in discussing with the Bosnian authorities and inter-&#13;
national donor community the improvements to and needs of the investment climate.&#13;
This work paid off with the signing of a guarantee for a project in fiscal 2000, and four&#13;
more in the past fiscal year: one for investments guaranteed by Austria's export credit&#13;
agency and reinsured by the trust fund for the Bosnian branch of the Austrian&#13;
bank OVAG, one by the Raiffeisenbank of Austria, one for an investment by Hypo-&#13;
Alpe-Adria Bank, also Austrian, and another for a Dutch investment in a medical&#13;
dialysis facility in the Republika Srpska. Total MIGA and EU coverage of Bosnian FDI&#13;
exceeds $70 million.&#13;
The West Bank and Gaza Investment Guarantee Trust Fund This trust fund was created to&#13;
provide political risk insurance administered by MIGA and in cooperation with the&#13;
Palestinian Authority. Fund contributors are the Palestinian Authority, the European&#13;
Investment Bank, and the government of Japan. MIGA has received applications for&#13;
approximately $20 million in potential new investments in the West Bank and Gaza&#13;
in infrastructure, manufacturing, real estate, services, telecommunications, and&#13;
tourism.&#13;
Southeastern Europe Trust Fund MIGA has been working to establish a political risk&#13;
guarantee trust fund for Southeastern Europe, with a special focus on SMEs, to be&#13;
financed by the donor community.&#13;
THE FUTURE&#13;
MIGA's challenge in the face of a changing global economy is to remain an industry&#13;
leader in facilitating FDI that is environmentally, socially, and developmentally sound,&#13;
especially into those countries that need it most. To do so, MIGA will continue to be&#13;
innovative and flexible in the types of projects it supports and the products and services&#13;
it provides, while seeking to mobilize its partners to increase the availability of political&#13;
risk insurance.&#13;
Fiscal 2001 saw important developments along these fronts that will enhance the&#13;
agency's ability to address its strategic priorities. The years ahead will see continued&#13;
efforts in this regard, including stronger marketing and expanded outreach to inter-&#13;
national investors through mobile offices and field representation, closer part-&#13;
nerships and alliances with national and private insurers, and expanded collaboration&#13;
with the private insurance industry through coinsurance and treaty and facultative&#13;
reinsurance.&#13;

box7 MICA HELPS NEW AFRICAN TRADE AND INVESTMENT PROMOTION AGENCY&#13;
In its ongoing efforts to support FDI flows into developing countries, and particularly into Africa and&#13;
among African countries, M IGA has been providing advice and other assistance to the nascent African&#13;
Trade Insurance Agency (ATI), which is expected to be formally launched in the second halfof2001.&#13;
ATl's objective is tofacilitatetrade and investment intoAfrica, and from African nations into other&#13;
parts ofthe developingworld, by providing insurance against a varietyof noncommercial risks. ATI may&#13;
also provide insurance against commercial risks in Africa. Membership is open to all African countries,&#13;
with the initiative being launched by Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.&#13;
Other African countries have already expressed interest in joining this new agency. ATI will cooperate&#13;
with private risk insurers to provide insurance products tailored to the needs of the market, and has&#13;
appointed a highly respected Lloyd's underwriter as its first managing director. Users are expected to&#13;
include African and non-African firms and banks selling and financing goods and services to partici-&#13;
pating African nations, as well as African firms from member states trading with or investing in non-&#13;
African developing nations.&#13;
MIGA will continue to support this endeavor by providing ongoing training for ATI staff, sec-&#13;
ondment of MIGA staff to ATl's Nairobi headquarters, and support of ATl's membership drive. The&#13;
World Bank, for its part, will provide credits to participating countries to back up ATI-issued insurance&#13;
policies. By addressing head-on the risk perceptions of firms doing business in Africa, this African-led&#13;
initiative is an important step in increasing the continent's share of FDI flows to developing countries,&#13;
which has remained low, despite significant economic liberalization.&#13;

Asia and the Pacific W#4YJC&gt;j&#13;
PAKISTAN&#13;
Habib Bank AG Zurich&#13;
(Habib Bank AG Zurich Pakistan)&#13;
MIGA has provided a guarantee to Habib Bank AG Zurich for its equity investment in&#13;
its Pakistan branches. The guarantee is for $2.7 million and provides coverage against&#13;
the risks of transfer restriction and expropriation of funds. Habib Bank AG Zurich is&#13;
already present in Pakistan, with seven branches in locations around the country, and&#13;
offers general banking products, financial advisory services, and capital market trans-&#13;
actions. This investment will allow Habib Bank AG Zurich to expand and diversify the&#13;
services already offered, and to broaden its coverage by opening two new branches.&#13;
MIGA has provided similar guarantees to Habib Bank AG Zurich twice in the past.&#13;
The project is expected to produce significant developmental benefits. It will&#13;
expand the availability of financing to SMEs, and lower the costs of financing by&#13;
increasing competition in the financial services industry. It will also broaden the range&#13;
and quality of banking services, by introducing new technologies, such as ATM&#13;
machines and electronic banking. The project will require hiring approximately 25 new&#13;
staff, for whom extensive training programs will be provided. An estimated&#13;
$0.7 million is expected to accrue to the government in annual tax revenues.&#13;
PHILIPPINES&#13;
EGIS Projects S.A.&#13;
Westdeutsche Landesbank (West LB)&#13;
(Manila North Tollway Corporation)&#13;
MIGA is providing guarantees totaling $87 million to EGIS Projects S.A. of France for&#13;
its equity investment and to a syndicate of banks led by West LB for a loan to the Manila&#13;
North Tollway Corporation. Coverage is against the risks of transfer restriction, expro-&#13;
priation, and war and civil disturbance. Recent economic prosperity has accelerated&#13;
motorization and demand for mobility in Manila, causing severe traffic congestion and&#13;
environmental problems. One of the area's key arteries is the North Luzon Expressway,&#13;
which is in urgent need of repair. The project involves widening and rehabilitating 82&#13;
kilometers of the expressway, Southeast Asia's oldest toll road. Also participating in the&#13;
undertaking are IFC, Asian Development Bank, EFIC (Australia's export finance&#13;
agency), and COFACE (France's export credit agency).&#13;
The refurbished highway is expected to move industrial traffic away from&#13;
heavily congested areas and improve traffic flows. This will allow for more rapid&#13;
movement of goods and people between Metro Manila, the economic zones of Subic&#13;
and Clark, the international airports of Manila and Clark, the international port&#13;
of Manila, and several other important industrial zones in the area. A number of&#13;

multipurpose complexes are already being built along the highway corridor to take&#13;
advantage of the high traffic volume out of Metro Manila. Additionally, the project&#13;
will contribute to the reduction of vehicle operating costs and provide increased road&#13;
safety. During the two-year construction period, the investment is expected to create&#13;
1,ooo temporary jobs.&#13;
VIETNAM&#13;
France Cables et Radio Vietnam Pte. Ltd.&#13;
MIGA issued $1o million in guarantee coverage to France Cables et Radio Vietnam Pte.&#13;
Ltd. for its nonequity direct investment, via a business cooperation contract, with the&#13;
state-owned Vietnam Post and Telecommunications agency. The guarantee is pro-&#13;
tecting the investor against the risk of transfer restriction.&#13;
The contract calls for the two companies to work together-on a build-and-&#13;
transfer basis-to construct, install, and maintain at least 540,000 new fixed telephone&#13;
lines in East Ho Chi Minh City over a 15-year period. The project area should see a&#13;
major boost in the number of lines per person (teledensity) by 2003, with an increase&#13;
of 20,000 lines in the city's rural outskirts. Teledensity, currently at 5 percent, is&#13;
expected to reach 21 percent by the project's completion in 2005. The project sponsor&#13;
also plans to spend about $1 million a year to train local staff.&#13;

Commercial Bank of Greece S.A.&#13;
(Intercommercial Bank S.A. Albania)&#13;
MIGA provided the Commercial Bank of Greece S.A. with a $7 million guarantee to&#13;
cover its equity investment in the Intercommercial Bank S.A. Albania, one of its sub-&#13;
sidiaries. The investment will be protected against transfer restriction, expropriation,&#13;
and war and civil disturbance. The project will introduce a number of financial services&#13;
previously unavailable in Albania, an IDA-eligible country. Currently, the bank has&#13;
only one location, in Tirana, but other branches and offices are planned.&#13;
The project will broaden the range and quality of financial services in Albania,&#13;
especially in project finance, trade finance, and money market activities. It will also&#13;
increase the availability of medium- and long-term capital to SMEs and retail firms,&#13;
and provide them with lower costs of funding. The target for these services includes&#13;
small and medium-size domestic firms and domestic retail companies, as well&#13;
as foreign companies. The project supports the government's financial sector reform&#13;
and privatization program, and is expected to provide training to its 6o new&#13;
local employees.&#13;

International Dialysis Centers B.V.&#13;
(International Dialysis Center Banja Luka DOO)&#13;
The project, marking the first foreign investment in the Bosnian health sector, is for&#13;
the creation and management of a renal dialysis facility in the city of Banja Luka.&#13;
MIGA provided two guarantees, totaling $1.3 million, to the International Dialysis&#13;
Centers B.V. of the Netherlands. The first guarantee is for an equity investment in the&#13;
International Dialysis Center Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina, covering the&#13;
risks of expropriation, and war and civil disturbance. The second guarantee covers&#13;
obligations of the Health Insurance Fund and the Republika Srpska for the provision&#13;
of dialysis services, protecting the investor against breach of contract. The European&#13;
Union Investment Guarantee Fund, administered by MIGA, is providing additional&#13;
coverage.&#13;
Renal dialysis treatment is an acute problem in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the&#13;
new facility is expected to provide high-quality dialysis scrvices for up to a fourth of all&#13;
dialysis patients living in the Republika Srpska. The project uses state-of-the-art&#13;
medical equipment, which is helping to improve life expectancy and quality of life for&#13;
dialysis patients. As the treatment center is located within an existing hospital, the&#13;
latter will benefit from refurbishment of the premises for the new facility. In addition,&#13;
the project will supply a medical waste and water treatment unit, and is already pro-&#13;
viding extensive technical, medical, and managerial training to staff of the new facility.&#13;

Hypo-Alpe-Adria Bank AG&#13;
(Auro Banka dd)&#13;
MIGA issued two guarantees to Hypo-Alpe-Adria Bank for an equity investment&#13;
in, and shareholder loan to, Auro Banka in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The equity&#13;
investment will be covered against the risks of expropriation, and war and civil&#13;
disturbance; the shareholder loan will be covered against transfer restriction,&#13;
expropriation of funds, and war and civil disturbance. MIGA's exposure totals $21.9&#13;
million. The European Investment Trust Fund will also cover up to $1.8 million. With&#13;
this project, Auro Banka intends to expand and diversify its services, which include&#13;
trade, corporate finance, and retail banking in 26 branches throughout the Federation&#13;
of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska.&#13;
The project will contribute to restructuring the country's financial sector by&#13;
improving the quality and diversity of financial products and by increasing the number&#13;
of Western European banks in the region. Such an expansion will be conducive&#13;
to a greater degree of regional integration. Specifically, SMEs in the agriculture and&#13;
construction sectors will gain access to lower-cost financing. In addition, Auro Banka&#13;
will contribute an estimated $0.5 million in annual tax revenues and provide extensive&#13;
training programs for approximately 15 new staff each year over the next three years.&#13;

Osterreichische Volksbank AG opened its doors for business in Sarajevo last summer&#13;
The project is insured through the Osterreichische Kontrollbank, Austria's main&#13;
financial and information service provider. MIGA has underwritten the $2.7 million&#13;
reinsurance as administrator of the European Union Investment Guarantee Trust&#13;
Fund. Volksbank BH's activities will include consumer loans, short- and long-term&#13;
business loans (targeting SMEs), financial leasing, credit cards, and international and&#13;
local payments. The guarantee provides coverage against the risks of transfer&#13;

needed to facilitate the transition to a market-based economy. As the first Western&#13;
European bank in-country, the project will have a significant developmental impact,&#13;
helping to increase consumer confidence and improve the standards of local banks,&#13;
particularly the quality and diversity of financial products. It will also provide access to&#13;
the banking sector for SMEs, which have suffered from a lack of financing in recent&#13;
years. Moreover, the project will contribute about $1.25 million annually to the&#13;
government in the form of profit taxes, duties, and royalties, and is expected to create&#13;
78 new jobs.&#13;

against the political risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, war and civil dis-&#13;

vatized electricity distribution companies in Moldova. The project is expected to help&#13;
reduce power shortfalls and blackouts that until recently disrupted service delivery up&#13;
to eight hours a day in some parts of this Eastern European country.&#13;
The guarantee, MIGA's second for a project in Moldova, covers part of an&#13;
investment by Uni6n Fenosa. which bought the electricity distribution companies&#13;
from the government in February 2000. The purchase was part of an energy sector&#13;
overhaul engineered by the World Bank and the Moldovan government to help&#13;
revive the economy in a country where more than half the population lives on less than&#13;
$1 a day. The IFC and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are both&#13;
lending $25 million to the project.&#13;
The project's chief thrust is to reduce technical and commercial energy losses-&#13;
resulting mainly from poorly maintained equipment and low levels of bill collection-&#13;
that have made the companies financially unsustainable and led to unreliable power&#13;
supply. Investments will focus on metering and a state-of-the-art customer man-&#13;
agement and billing system. Infrastructure and technology improvements are&#13;
expected to lead to decreased carbon dioxide emissions. The project is expected to have&#13;
a significant impact on the lives of Moldovans, and will be an important component in&#13;
Moldova's efforts to reform its energy sector.&#13;

for its shareholder loan to Banco Santander Colombia S.A. The guarantee will protect&#13;
the loan against transfer restriction and expropriation of funds. A quarter of the&#13;
guarantee is being covered through facultative reinsurance. Banco Santander Colombia,&#13;
a key provider of financial services in the country, offers a plethora of financial products&#13;
and services at more than a hundred branches and customer service locations&#13;
throughout the country. The financing will help the bank expand its loan service&#13;
program to offer low-cost, medium-term financing to SMEs.&#13;
As a result of the project, Colombian SMEs, especially in the manufacturing sector,&#13;
where they are most active, will be able to acquire new machinery and equipment. The&#13;
project will thus help increase output. Simultaneously, the improved availability of&#13;
sources of financing will increase competition and ameliorate the quality of the financial&#13;
sector. This project supports the consolidation and restructuring of the banking sector&#13;

A $16.4 million MIGA guarantee is protecting an equity investment in a Costa Rican&#13;
development project against the risk of transfer restriction. The project involves the&#13;
development of a 210-room resort set on approximately 120 acres of the Papagayo&#13;
Peninsula in the country's Pacific northwest province of Guanacaste. The hotel is part&#13;
of a much larger government program to develop the peninsula's tourist potential,&#13;
which includes plans to develop residential, hotel, and commercial venues. MIGA's&#13;
guarantee is for the resort's construction and expansion.&#13;
The project is expected to generate considerable government revenues and be a&#13;
significant foreign exchange earner. Some 500 jobs will be created during the con-&#13;
struction phase and more than 340 permanent local positions thereafter. A budget of&#13;
$3.5 million is allocated for training onsite and abroad. The resort will rely on local&#13;
building materials, and an estimated 70 percent of products will be purchased locally,&#13;
notably agricultural produce, providing income to a considerable number of local&#13;
entrepreneurs.&#13;

the project is expected to meet close to 40 percent of domestic demand for gas&#13;
products. Most of the spare parts and consumables required for the ongoing operations&#13;
will be procured locally. The project is expected to generate 200 local jobs during the&#13;
construction phase and 17 during the operational stage. For the latter, extensive&#13;
training will be provided in the operations of the terminal.&#13;

MIGA achieved several firsts with the signing of an $i8 million guarantee for the&#13;
rehabilitation and expansion of water services in Guayaquil. Ecuador. The project&#13;
represents MIGA's first coverage of a water project and of a performance bond. The&#13;
guarantee offers protection against the risks of expropriation and war and civil&#13;
disturbance for an investment by International Water Services B.V. of the Netherlands&#13;
in an Ecuadorian subsidiary. It also covers a performance bond-posted in accordance&#13;
with the 30-year concession-that guarantees the company's successful management.&#13;
expansion, and operation of the water services, against the risk of wrongful call.&#13;
The investment aims to improve the services and operating performance of the&#13;
existing municipal water utility, especially to poor areas that have little access to potable&#13;
water and poor sanitary conditions, by reducing the amount of water that is unac-&#13;
counted for and increasing cash collection. During the first five years of the concession,&#13;
improvements must be made in the quality of water services, as well as in the number&#13;
of potable water and sewage connections. Service coverage is expected to increase by&#13;
30-40 percent. The new project is expected to help improve health and living con-&#13;
ditions for the local population, while reducing the cost of water for those who&#13;
currently rely on other sources of water.&#13;

for its loan to Hidropastaza S.A. The guarantee covers the risk of breach of contract,&#13;
with an additional amount is to be covered under the CUP. The project involves the&#13;
construction and operation of a run-of-river hydroelectric plant, called San Francisco&#13;
Hydroelectric, southeast of Quito. The 230 MW power plant will be located almost&#13;
entirely underground, with water from a nearby river fed to generators via an under-&#13;
ground tunnel. Electricity generated at the plant will be sold either on a spot basis in&#13;
Ecuador or through short-term purchase agreements with public and private organi-&#13;
zations. The hydroelectric project is expected to significantly help the country's power&#13;
sector expand its capacity, leading to a reduction in the average energy price in the&#13;
wholesale market and helping to alleviate current bottleneck problems. The project will&#13;
play a pilot role in the sector's privatization. Major savings will result from the plant as&#13;
the energy will substitute for expensive fossil fuel imports. Moreover, the project will&#13;
have a positive downstream effect on industries heavily dependent on power, such as&#13;
cement plants and steel mills.&#13;
The project is expected to give priority to the use of local labor, infrastructure, and&#13;
services during construction. Hidropastaza will generate about i,5oo jobs during the&#13;
construction phase and approximately 70 local permanent positions thereafter.&#13;
Employees will receive extensive training, both in Brazil and Ecuador, using advanced&#13;
technology. Over the first five years of operation, an estimated $27 million will accrue&#13;
to the government in the form of taxes and dividends.&#13;

the risk of expropriation. The project involves the construction and operation of an&#13;
international port on the island of Trinitaria, needed to handle the country's growing&#13;
fruit exports. The planned port will contain fully modernized equipment and will be&#13;
accessible by two major highways.&#13;
The new port operations will initially provide approximately 300 construction jobs&#13;
in an area of high unemployment. Thereafter, an estimated 235 new local jobs will be&#13;
created for the handling of bulk and containerized shipments to the area. Once&#13;
operational, the new facilities will allow for increased exports, estimated at $200&#13;
million annually, thereby boosting the availability of foreign exchange and supporting&#13;
the dollarization process, as well as sustaining the growing and vital fruit export sector&#13;
in Ecuador. Moreover, it may provide an incentive for an increase in fresh produce&#13;

to Uni6n Fenosa Intemacional S.A., of Spain, for its equity investment in and loan to&#13;
Distribuidora El6ctrica de Oriente S.A. and Distribuidora Electrica de Occidente S.A.&#13;
The project involves the purchase of 85 percent of shares in the two companies. In&#13;
addition to assuming management and operational control, the project will help&#13;

economic imbalances arising from the dearth of electricity in rural areas. The&#13;
guarantee is protecting the project against the risks of transfer restriction, expro-&#13;
priation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
By assisting in the implementation of the government's rural electrification&#13;
program, the project will contribute to the expansion of services to more than 220,000&#13;
new customers in underdeveloped areas of Guatemala that have suffered from power&#13;
shortages and blackouts. The privatization will allow for increased electricity distri-&#13;
bution without a substantial addition of generating capacity and for a significant&#13;
improvement in the delivery of service. The increased reliability and efficiency of power&#13;
distribution is expected to foster overall economic activity in Guatemala. Moreover, the&#13;
transfer of skills and technology will result in enhanced customer service, widespread&#13;
use of metering, and the installation of modern information systems.&#13;

that country. The $39.1 million MIGA guarantee will protect an investment by Kemira&#13;
Danmark A/S of Denmark in the Kemira Arab Potash Co., Ltd. The coverage is for two&#13;
shareholder counter-guaranties provided to its affiliate company, Kemira Agro Oy of&#13;
Finland, for guaranties to the project financiers (the European Investment Bank and&#13;
the Islamic Development Bank). MIGA is protecting the investment against the risks&#13;
of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
The project is significant in many ways, not least of which is the international&#13;
collaboration involving numerous parties. As MIGANs first project in Jordan, it also&#13;
underscores the agency's intent to play a larger role in the region. The deal is the first&#13;
reinsurance of a MIGA contract by Finnvera, Finland's investment insurance agency.&#13;
The collaboration is the result of an October 2000 agreement between the two agencies&#13;
to work together to coinsure and reinsure projects, with the goal of increasing Finnish&#13;
investment into emerging economies.&#13;
The project consists of the construction of a new plant to produce and export a spe-&#13;
cialty fertilizer and an animal feed supplement. Minerals from the Dead Sea and&#13;
Eshidiya region will provide the primary product input. The project enterprise plans to&#13;
annually export 150,000 tons of potassium nitrate (fertilizer) and 75,000 tons of di-&#13;
calcium phosphate (animal feed supplement).&#13;
MIGA expects the project to create an estimated 140 jobs, benefit directly from&#13;
advanced technology and generate an average of $54.5 million of fertilizer exports&#13;
during the first five years of operation. The project will also supply fertilizer to the&#13;
local market.&#13;

GROWING DEMAND FOR TAILORED ASSISTANCE&#13;
The past year saw robust demand for MIGA's technical&#13;
assistance services from clients across all regions. MIGA's&#13;
Investment Marketing Services Department's mission is to&#13;
equip investment promotion intermediaries with leading-&#13;
edge tools and techniques to strengthen their capacity to&#13;
attract and retain foreign direct investment. MIGA's hands-&#13;
on technical assistance emphasizes the transfer of best&#13;
practices in FDI promotion, while MIGA's online information&#13;
services leverage these capacity-building efforts by linking&#13;
investors directly to relevant information on investment opportunities and business operating conditions.&#13;
Offering a broad array of services&#13;
MIGA's technical assistance takes many different forms, encompassing the range of&#13;
services required to define and deliver support to investment intermediaries at all&#13;
stages of development. In most instances, MIGA uses the Needs Assessment&#13;
Framework as a baseline for assistance at the country level, to assess the capabilities&#13;
and limitations of a client in its efforts to attract FDI.&#13;
Tlhe Needs Assessment Framework is also the basis from which MIGA develops&#13;
recommendations for further steps to be taken to improve the prospects for FDI, with&#13;
or without our involvement. For those countries in which further involvement is war-&#13;
ranted, MIGA provides client-specific support through one-on-one strategic planning,&#13;
hands-on training and coaching, tailored workshops, investor targeting exercises, and&#13;
assistance in information technology (IT) and its application.&#13;
Topics covered are as broad as the range of needs that are identified, including&#13;
program planning, market research, investor targeting, investor servicing and&#13;
aftercare, and Web site development, among others. Some clients might also be&#13;
referred to FIAS for assistance, or to external parties for support.&#13;
As MIGA has moved over the past several years from short-term assistance to&#13;
longer-term capacity building, there has been a need to establish new, objective criteria&#13;
by which the effectiveness of its interventions can be judged. Thus, in fiscal 2001, the&#13;
multilateral investment guarantee agency wrr d bank group 59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
technical assistance services&#13;
Investment Marketing Services department defined and implemented a new project&#13;
reporting system to improve its monitoring and evaluation capabilities. Technical&#13;
assistance activities are now being tracked and assessed on a geographic and functional&#13;
basis for each project undertaken, and baseline data collected for FDI flows in each&#13;
country, recognizing that there are long lead times involved in investment promotion&#13;
and many external factors which influence a country's ability to attract and&#13;
sustain investment.&#13;
MIGA's assistance is client-specific and therefore success measures depend to a&#13;
degree on the stage of development and sophistication of the particular client agency.&#13;
With the project data standardized and baseline data established, MIGA is broadening&#13;
its monitoring and evaluation activities to examine the effects of our long-term projects&#13;
on the MIGA-assisted investment promotion agency's ability to attract investment and&#13;
by tracking the broad FDI flows into client countries by sector and country of origin.&#13;
Taken together, the data on project activities and FDI flows will present a more detailed&#13;
picture of the economic prospects for the country and the role of MIGA services.&#13;
In fiscal 2001, MIGA implemented 59 technical assistance or advisory service&#13;
projects. Forty of these (67 percent) were long-term technical assistance projects. In&#13;
many cases, these projects were multifaceted efforts incorporating strategy devel-&#13;
opment, hands-on training, assistance in information technology, and other elements&#13;
of service delivery. More than half (20) of the 38 countries receiving technical&#13;
assistance are IDA designates. A significant portion of the technical assistance&#13;
activities were undertaken in cooperation with the World Bank and FIAS.&#13;
Asia and the Pacific 4CO5f'&#13;
MIYAZAWA INITIATIVE&#13;
During the past year, MIGA continued its work under the Miyazawa Initiative. MIGA's&#13;
efforts in the Republic of Korea, the Philippines and Thailand under this $1 million&#13;
initiative are discussed below. Initiatives are being prepared for Indonesia; however,&#13;
deeper work on an investment promotion strategy will depend on progress in legal and&#13;
regulatory reforms relating to FDI and investment approvals. MIGA is coordinating its&#13;
efforts there with the World Bank and FIAS.&#13;
REPUBLIC OF KOREA&#13;
Early in fiscal 2001, MIGA facilitated a Needs Assessment of the Korean Investment&#13;
Service Center (KISC), a part of the Korean Trade Investment Promotion Agency in&#13;
Seoul. KISC asked MICA to conduct the assessment to coincide with KISC's second&#13;
anniversary, with the intention to use the results as a guide toward meaningful capacity&#13;
building going forward. During the assessment, MIGA guided KISC staff in bench-     U&#13;
marking their organization against best practices worldwide.&#13;
In Seoul, MIGA also presented a seminar on greenfield investment for KISC and&#13;
the Korea Office of the Investment Ombudsman. Although the Republic of Korea&#13;
has experienced tremendous FDI inflows over the past two years, they have almost&#13;
60  multilateral investment guarantee agency world banl group&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
technical assistance services&#13;
exclusively been in the form of mergers and acquisitions. The Republic of Korea is now&#13;
focusing more attention on targeting and attracting greenfield investment. The&#13;
seminar highlighted trends in FDI flows to Asia and provided insight into how&#13;
investment decisions are made by foreign investors. Most recently, MIGA has been&#13;
working with KISC to better position the country to attract greenfield investments in&#13;
the high-technology industry.&#13;
PHILIPPINES&#13;
In the case of the Philippines, coordination among competing agencies in terms of&#13;
their approach to attracting FDI is a focal point of the program. MIGA has convened&#13;
capacity-building sessions with national and regional investment promotion&#13;
agencies, including the Board of Investments (BOI), Export Processing Zone&#13;
Authority, and regional promotion entities for Davao, Mindanao, Subic, and other&#13;
locations.&#13;
MIGA conducted an information technology workshop for the BOI of the&#13;
Philippines and other related government agencies. The workshop focused on the&#13;
content, design, and marketing aspects of good investment promotion Web sites,&#13;
and included concrete suggestions on how to improve BOI's Web presence.&#13;
It also covered online research on sectors and companies to support the targeting&#13;
exercises undertaken through MICA's capacity-building program.&#13;
THAILAND&#13;
Building upon the institutional needs assessment conducted in fiscal 2000, MIGA&#13;
convened a capacity-building workshop for 6o staff members of the Thai Board of&#13;
Investment. The program focused on the microeconomic business environment and&#13;
the development and implementation of a comprehensive investor targeting program.&#13;
pent Promotion Skills i- MIGA's work with the agency on targeting is continuing, and work has begun on&#13;
investment promotion skills building. A training program was held with staff on how&#13;
to research Thailand's target industries. Bookmark files-lists of international&#13;
business Web sites compiled by MIGA staff-were used as key resource materials.&#13;
During hands-on sessions, participants were shown how to find data on FDI trends,&#13;
target companies, and sectoral information.&#13;
INDOCHINA&#13;
In a work program extending throughout the fiscal year, MIGA assisted the&#13;
governments of Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Vietnam&#13;
in establishing an Internet presence to service investors online. In each location, MIGA&#13;
provided a detailed orientation to senior officials. The sites were built using a&#13;
MIGA-designed Web application for investmentpromotion intermediaries (IPAworks),&#13;
which allows agencies to launch Web sites with minor customization to a template&#13;
incorporating best practices that MIGAhas identified. MIGA also provided assistance in&#13;
securing in-country support for the site to ensure a locally maintained Internet presence.&#13;

technical assistance services&#13;
This technical assistance is offered through the PHRD program, funded by the&#13;
Japanese government, which aims to help the governments of Cambodia, the Lao&#13;
People's Democratic Republic, and Vietnam (and has also included assistance to&#13;
Mongolia) improve their ability to attract private investment. MIGA has provided&#13;
technical assistance in the region through various activities such as training, develop-&#13;
ing marketing materials, and installing new information management systems for&#13;
investment promotion agencies. A mission to the region in January 20o0 marked the&#13;
final stage of the technical assistance. MIGA staff visited the agencies to gauge the&#13;
overall level of integration of products and services provided under the project to&#13;
ensure that they have been installed and accepted with highest client satisfaction.&#13;
System documentation was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.&#13;
SOUTH PACIFIC ISLANDS&#13;
In conjunction with FIAS, MIGA delivered an investment promotion training seminar&#13;
for the management and directors of investment promotion agencies in the South&#13;
Pacific. The event was attended by i f representatives from the Cook Islands, Fiji,&#13;
Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga.&#13;
Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Because of their size and relative geographic isolation, they face&#13;
unique challenges when trying to promote FDI. The main sectors of investment in&#13;
most of the economies are tourism, fisheries, and light manufacturing. MIGA's recent&#13;
experience working with the Organization of Eastem Caribbean States brought to bear&#13;
useful techniques the South Pacific islands could draw on to address promotional&#13;
issues of their own. The participants were also familiarized with the guarantees MIGA&#13;
offers to facilitate investment.&#13;
Europe and Central Asia                                                0&#13;
Over the past year, MIGA has collaborated extensively with the Organization for&#13;
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), World Bank and FIAS in efforts&#13;
to formulate and implement private sector strategies for the countries of Southeastern&#13;
Europe. In addition, Switzerland is funding a grant program for MIGA to deliver&#13;
a portfolio of capacity-building activities, including an investment promotion skills-&#13;
building program for East European and Central Asian countries. In September 2 000,&#13;
MIGA convened a workshop in Geneva under the program on how to use the Internet&#13;
to conduct sectoral research for staff of Central European, Southeastern European,&#13;
and Central Asian investment promotion agencies. The sectors of focus included&#13;
electronics, automotive components, information technology services, and mining.&#13;

ARMENIA&#13;
A joint MIGA/FIAS mission was undertaken to evaluate the possibility of a long-term&#13;
capacity-building program for the Armenian Development Agency (ADA). The&#13;
mission was designed to effect a clear link between the recommendations of an earlier&#13;
FIAS report on the investment environment andapossible MIGA program. MIGAmet&#13;
with key ministers and advisers to the President of Armenia, and worked closely with&#13;
i  representatives of the ADA, the World Bank, and IFC, and with donor agencies to&#13;
*  assess the progress made on enacting the recommendations of the FIAS report and&#13;
to assess the development needs of the ADA.&#13;
The mission was fully supported by the World Bank field office, and a compre-&#13;
hensive report with recommendations has been produced by MIGA and submitted by&#13;
the World Bank to the Armenian govemment. It is expected that this work will lead to&#13;
a multidonor, multiyear capacity-building program designed to enhance ADA's ability&#13;
to undertake effective promotion of Armenia as a location for foreign investment.&#13;
During the mission, MIGA also worked with the ADA to help it prepare and execute an&#13;
investor conference organized by the World Bank and IFC in May 2001.&#13;
KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
A component of MIGA's Eastern Europe and Central Asia capacity-building&#13;
program, funded by the Swiss government, made provision for an investment pro-&#13;
motion workshop in the Kyrgyz Republic. In preparation, MIGA undertook an&#13;
initial assessment of the Kyrgyz Republic's investment promotion structures and&#13;
designed a workshop program with the twin objectives of developing the expertise&#13;
of the officials responsible for investment promotion, and deepening the support&#13;
for FDI within government agencies. The delivery of the program was timed for&#13;
December 2000, after the presidential election, a period of intense interest in&#13;
policy issues. The five-day workshop program for investment promotion interme-&#13;
diaries included a day-long session for 30 representatives of key departments and&#13;
agencies and received extensive media coverage. In addition to supporting the&#13;
capacity development of the agencies' staff, the program contributed to broad&#13;
awareness of the potential role of FDI during this period of policy formation for the&#13;
new presidency.&#13;

MIGA visited Romania in June 2001 at the request of the Ministry of Development and&#13;
Prognosis to provide advice on how best to introduce, organize and fund its capacity to&#13;
effectively promote foreign investment, and to propose a capacity-building assistance&#13;
program for the relevant ministry or agency. In conjunction with the World Bank&#13;
country team, MIGA undertook an assessment of the current situation in Romania&#13;
vis-a-vis FDI, and made recommendations for building on the current structure of FDI&#13;
promotion to develop an improved and more proactive capacity for investment pro-&#13;

Privatization Link Russia -russia.privatizationlink. corn&#13;
MIGA is in the final stages of the PrivatizationLink Russia project-an initiative to         .&#13;
develop a bilingual investment information service for domestic and foreign investors  .  _&#13;
interested in Russian privatization opportunities. In this effort, MIGA has partnered  3&#13;
with CIDA, which provided $500,000 for the requisite field work, software devel-&#13;
opment, and project promotion. Initiated in April 1999, the project is being carried  r&#13;
out in cooperation with the Ministry of Property Relations of the Russian Federation&#13;
and the Russian Federal Property Fund.&#13;
PrivatizationLink Russia is designed to increase the transparency of the privati-&#13;
zation process in Russia by making more in-depth information available online                 ....&#13;
to potential investors around the world. Investors now have free desktop access to  s-  .-._s_ - n&#13;
business profiles of state-owned companies and assets currently for sale in the&#13;
Russian Federation, along with details on the laws, regulations, and procedures gov-&#13;
erning these transactions.&#13;
The PrivatizationLink Russia service was officially launched in October 2000 at&#13;
the US-Russian Investment Symposium. organized by the John F. Kennedy School of&#13;
Government of Harvard University in conjunction with the Financial Times and other&#13;
organizations. In November 2000, the Ministry of Property Relations informed&#13;
MIGA of its plans to significantly increase the scope of privatization in Russia over the&#13;
next two years, resulting in a higher-than-expected volume of company profiles to be&#13;
publicized through PrivatizationLink Russia. The ministry requested that MIGA&#13;
explore possible ways to extend the project and, together with the ministry's&#13;
information technology team, develop a database synchronization mechanism so&#13;
that company data can be automatically transferred from the ministry to the&#13;
online database.&#13;
Efforts are underway to finalize the technical work in cooperation with the&#13;
Ministry of Property Relations. MICA also held discussions with the Investment&#13;
Policy Department of the Russian Ministry of Economic Development and Trade with&#13;
regard to the department's potential involvement in the PrivatizationLink Russia&#13;
project and technical assistance that MIGA might provide to it.&#13;

Development over the past year, including regional meetings of chief executive officers&#13;
(CEOs) of investment promotion agencies (IPAs), held in September 2000 and&#13;
February 2001. The September meeting marked the opening by the OECD Secretary&#13;
General of new premises for the Centre, made available by the Turkish government. The&#13;
purpose of this meeting was to encourage govemments in the region to give greater&#13;
priority to supporting investment promotion activities in their countries and to define&#13;
support that international agencies could give to this effort. The February meeting&#13;
provided an opportunity to revise the work program and to present the new MIGA&#13;
Investment Promotion Toolkit to the participants.&#13;
MIGA also participated in the Summit Economic Forum of the Central European&#13;
Initiative (CEI), an intergovernmental forum for cooperation in the Central Eastern&#13;
European region, in Budapest. The World Bank's Europe and Central Asia (ECA)&#13;
Region actively supported the event through speakers and other contributions,&#13;
and MIGA staff spoke on "Information Technology and Investment Promotion" and&#13;
presented its investment marketing and guarantee services in a panel discussion on&#13;
international financial organizations.&#13;
IPAnet currently serves as an information dissemination tool for CEI projects.&#13;
CEInet, the electronic network of CEI, was one of the first sponsors of IPAnet,&#13;
beginning in 1997.&#13;
An Internet Skills Training Workshop for Eastern European and Central Asian&#13;
IPAs was conducted by MIGA in Geneva in September 2000. Eighteen participants&#13;
from 14 different countries (Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,&#13;
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Macedonia, Mongolia, Poland, Romania,&#13;
Slovenia, and Switzerland) were trained to use the Intemet for investment promotion,&#13;
focusing on both the marketing and research aspects of the Internet. It was organized&#13;
in cooperation with the UNCTAD Division on Investment, Technology and Enterprise&#13;
Development and WAIPA.&#13;
Thanks to funding from the Swiss government, MIGA was able to finance the&#13;
travel and subsistence costs of lo participants. Their overall positive feedback on the&#13;
workshop emphasized the high demand and need for training in the areas of&#13;
leveraging IT solutions to improve the efficiency of the IPAs' business processes and&#13;
keeping abreast of latest IT developments. MIGA plans to continue these Internet&#13;
training workshops and deliver them on a subregional or country basis.&#13;

BOLIVIA&#13;
At the request of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Investment, MIGA conducted an&#13;
assessment of the institutional environment for investment promotion during December&#13;
2000. Bolivia is interested in substantially increasing its investment promotion capability&#13;
to attract FDI. Working closely with the ministry and its implementing agency,&#13;
CEPROBOL, and assisted by the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB),&#13;
UNCTAD, and UNIDO, a targeted investment promotion program is being implemented&#13;
that will focus on promoting sectors such as apparel, textiles, jewelry, agro-industry, wood-&#13;
working, and export services. Depending on the availability of funds, a medium-term&#13;
technical assistance and capacity-building program will be implemented in the coming&#13;
years that will indude MIGA's investment promotion toolkit, investor targeting, foreign&#13;
promotion assistance, contact management, and investor information systems.&#13;
In May 2001, MIGA was asked by the Commonwealth Development Corporation&#13;
(CDC) to deliver a market research workshop for its staff in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. The&#13;
purpose was to provide hands-on training on how to research online data on sector trends&#13;
and companies to be targeted by CDC. As one of the main outputs of the workshop, a cus-&#13;
tomized list of online resources for the six sectors targeted by CDC was created. In addition&#13;
to the training, MIGA delivered concrete recommendations to ensure best use of online&#13;
resources by CDC staff to support its market intelligence efforts.&#13;
EL SALVADOR&#13;
Since December 2000, MIGA has been working with the Board of Directors and man-&#13;
agement of PRO.ESA, the national agency for investment promotion, to develop an&#13;
investment promotion strategy. A first draft was developed and circulated among all the&#13;
board members and management in PRO.ESA in early 2001, who then discussed and&#13;
refined the draft.&#13;
In March 2001, MIGA conducted a mission to El Salvador, consisting of three&#13;
separate activities: (1) assist PRO.ESA and its Board of Directors in finalizing the   P R 0 * E S A&#13;
agency's promotion strategy for the next 12 months; (2) demonstrate a beta version of a&#13;
contact management system for the agency's potential investor lead pipeline; and (3)&#13;
provide specialized training in investment promotion techniques for the agency staff&#13;
and management, managers from local free trade zones, and representatives from&#13;
govemment institutions and other partners.&#13;

At the request of the National Competitiveness Program and the Minister of Economy,&#13;
MIGA assisted in the establishment of the new investment promotion agency,&#13;
PROGUAT-Invest, in Guatemala. MIGA helped develop detailed job descriptions and&#13;
evaluation criteria for the selection of key staff members, as well as suggesting an orga-&#13;
nizational structure and indicative budgetary requirements for the agency. A selection&#13;
committee was organized to interview and select the final candidate for the CEO&#13;
position of the agency, and MIGA served as an adviser to this group. During the trip,&#13;
meetings were also organized with the Ministry of Economy and the Competitiveness&#13;
Program to discuss plans for MIGA's current capacity-building and technical&#13;
assistance program. Earlier in the year, MIGA conducted a validation workshop to&#13;
provide an opportunity for open discussion among key stakeholders on proposed free&#13;
zones legislation.&#13;
PANAMA&#13;
MIGA is working with the World Bank's Private Sector Advisory Services (PSAS) in&#13;
Panama. PSAS has signed an advisory mandate with the Panamanian Inter-oceanic&#13;
Regional Authority-ARI-to act as advisor for the conversion to civilian use of the&#13;
former US Howard Air Force base and surrounding land.&#13;
The focus of MIGA's work is to assess the facility's comparative and competitive&#13;
advantages for a Special Economic Zone; identify high-potential activities for the&#13;
former base and develop scenarios for their development; recommend a legal and tax&#13;
regime; help define institutional arrangements to regulate and manage the base,&#13;
including the creation of a dedicated development agency with a clear definition of its&#13;
functions and procedures; and identify bottlenecks to FDI. During the initial mission&#13;
in June 2001, MICA played a key role supporting public relations for the project in&#13;
Panama, making presentations to business leaders and associations, government insti-&#13;
tutions, and other relevant stakeholders regarding the objectives, approach, and risks&#13;
and rewards of the project. When necessary, MICA will also provide advice to the&#13;
project leaders and consulting teams on the quality control and supervision of the work&#13;
under development.&#13;
N ICARAGUA&#13;
MICA staff traveled to Nicaragua in September 2000 to conduct an institutional&#13;
assessment of the Center for Exports and Investments, the national IPA. In the process&#13;
of evaluating the Center and the investment environment, the MIGA team met with&#13;
C  E  I1          more than 50 individuals from the private and public sectors, both local and foreign. In&#13;
January 2001, MIGA presented the results of the assessment to key stakeholders in the&#13;
investment promotion arena. Based on the insights and recommendations of the&#13;
assessment, the MIGA team was able to design a long-term assistance program to be&#13;
implemented in conjunction with the World Bank's lending operations.&#13;
The Nicaragua project provides MIGA with the opportunity to cooperate with&#13;
World Bank lending operations and will likely serve as a model that can be replicated&#13;
in other countries in the region and around the world. The first components&#13;

box 8 NEW APPROACH TO PROVIDING TRAINING IN INVESTOR TARGETING&#13;
One ofthe greatest challenges faced by investment promotion agencies is howtotargettheir investment&#13;
promotion efforts to those investors with the highest probability for investing in their country, and to do&#13;
so in a cost-effective manner.&#13;
With these needs in mind, M GA's investment promotion officers designed a lo-day course on con-&#13;
ducting market intelligence and investor research that was offered in Washington in April 2001.          ,&#13;
Investment promotion officers from Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua were introduced to        .1&#13;
market research techniques and trained in the use of print and online resources available through a  ,&#13;
spectrum of industry and company databases and Web sites, including those of the World Bank.                    . *       'J&#13;
Extensive training was provided in Internet-based research, and participants used these new skills to&#13;
work on specific targeting projects for their respective countries and priority sectors. At the end of the&#13;
program, they returned home with valuable information resources, company contacts and new skills to&#13;
facilitate future market intelligence gathering in support oftheir investment promotion efforts.&#13;
This training not only complemented technical assistance and capacity-building efforts underway  photo I participants in April 2001&#13;
with each national agency, but provided an opportunity for the participants to develop new networks of    investor targeting workshop for Latin&#13;
colleagues within the region, paving the way for potentially valuable approaches to regional promotion.  American  investment promotion&#13;

organization of this event, which attracted 400 participants representing private and&#13;
public sector organizations from 18 countries. The forum explored investment and&#13;
development opportunities in the region and examined the issues that could shape the&#13;
tourism sector in the 21St century. Both traditional investor countries and developing&#13;
countries ofthe LAC region were represented.&#13;
MIGA also participated in the Fifth Latin American Free Zones Conference, held&#13;
in August 2000 in San Jose, Costa Rica. Free zones have played an important role as a&#13;
development instrument for countries promoting FDI. In Latin America alone, com-&#13;
panies located in free zones account for more than three million jobs. They have been&#13;
an essential factor in the extraordinary FDI growth evidenced in countries such as&#13;
Costa Rica and Honduras, and more countries are considering free zones as an&#13;
element of their development strategies.&#13;

For the first time, this annual event was held in Sub-Saharan Africa when MIGA&#13;
convened the symposium in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in December 2000. The&#13;
symposium attracted more than 200 representatives of private international mining&#13;
companies and over lo o public sector delegates from African countries. A roundtable&#13;
meeting between African mining ministers and mining company executives set the&#13;
tone by focusing on: recent global mining trends and their implications for Africa; the&#13;
interface between governments and mining companies; the need to improve the&#13;
legal, regulatory, fiscal, and institutional framework for mining; and ways to maximize&#13;
development impacts. The symposium highlighted the consensus that mining devel-&#13;
opment should take place in a manner that affords maximum protection to the&#13;
environment and safeguards the rights of local communities.&#13;
Opened by the President of Burkina Faso, the first part dealt with current trends&#13;
and challenges facing the mining sector while the second part focused on the pro-&#13;
motion of specific investment opportunities by participating countries. The general&#13;
sessions resulted in a number of private meetings between country representatives and&#13;
interested companies with a view to making investments. Following the symposium,&#13;

African Connection (AC)&#13;
This initiative to promote investment in telecommunications infrastructure on the&#13;
continent was begun by African leaders in 1999, and has since been supported by&#13;
MIGA and the World Bank. Following the establishment of the AC Secretariat this year,&#13;
MIGA began working with the Secretariat's staff to upgrade the pilot version of the AC&#13;

The AC Telecomms Database is designed to be a resource for telecomms&#13;
investors, policymakers, and regulators. It contains a compilation of the laws and reg-&#13;
ulations governing African telecommunications, market overviews and analysis of&#13;
sector markets in the region, a collection of best practice materials on telecomms reg-&#13;
ulation, as well as in-depth information on investing in Africa. MIGA is in the process&#13;
of completing its implementation plan for the site, which calls for: enhancing the&#13;
features and content of the AC Telecomms Database; integrating the information&#13;
service into a larger Web site addressing the full scope of activities being carried out&#13;
under tlle AC initiative; recruiting a conterit mnanager to work within the Secretariat&#13;
to maintain the site; and implementing a sponsorship-driven fundraising program to&#13;
support the future operation of this unique online resource.                               5ARIE  DE SON!&#13;

Community of West African States) and the Port Authority of Lomb in jointly&#13;
organizinga Maritime Investment and Strategic Partnership Forum inLome,Togo, in April&#13;
2001. The objective of the Forum was to identify investment opportunities in the&#13;
maritime sector, and to initiate a coastal shipping project, ECOMARINE, that a group&#13;
of investors in West Africa will implement to reduce obstacles to FDI and facilitate&#13;
regional integration.&#13;
Elsewhere in the region, MIGA convened a series of regional capacity-building&#13;
workshops for investment promotion officers from the countries that comprise the&#13;
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). Throughout the year, sessions&#13;
were held in Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique and Zambia, with participants from&#13;
Ethiopia, Ghana, Mauritius, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe,&#13;
and the US (via videoconference).                                                                                 r&#13;

effective in their functions.&#13;
MIGA, with support from the World Economic Forum, hosted the Third Annual&#13;
Roundtable of Investment Promotion Agencies Heads of SADC IPAs, in South Africa. The&#13;
event was attended by lo IPA executives from the SADC region and provided a forum&#13;
for them to discuss and consider the implications of preferential trade agreements&#13;
recently negotiated with the EU and United States. Immediately following the&#13;
roundtable, MIGA staff attended the World Economic Forum's Southern African&#13;
Economic Summit, where the IDA credit supporting the Africa Trade Initiative was&#13;
signed, and information was provided to investors interested in Africa concerning&#13;
MIGA's insurance against noncommercial risks.&#13;

GLOBAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES&#13;
MIGA is a pioneer in the field of online investment&#13;
information, having developed and launched four&#13;
Web sites over the past six years. Beginning with&#13;
IPAnet in 1995, PrivatizationLink in 1998,&#13;
PrivatizationLink Russia in 2000, and the African&#13;
Connection Telecomms Database in 2001, MIGA&#13;
has taken a lead role in mobilizing and publishing&#13;
information   on  investment  opportunities,&#13;
conditions, and partnerships to the more than 25,000 monthly users of these services worldwide.&#13;
Information dissemination services are not necessarily transaction-based. They are&#13;
designed to provide legal and regulatory information, business operating conditions,&#13;
and a wide range of data to support investor decision-making. In the case of&#13;
PrivatizationLink, however, concrete transactions have been linked to the service,&#13;
including sales of several state-owned enterprises in Armenia and Moldova to Italian&#13;
and U.S. firms.&#13;
The value of MIGA's online information services to the international investment&#13;
community is also evidenced through the highly positive responses received in user&#13;
surveys. In fiscal 2001, MIGA conducted a survey of more than g,ooo professionals as&#13;
a part of its preparatory work for the FDI Xchange, an email-based investment update&#13;
service to be launched later this year. MIGA received 330 responses from a broad range&#13;
of companies, including major Fortune 500 corporations as well as SMEs. Overall, the&#13;
respondents indicated a high level of interest in receiving this new information service,&#13;
with 6o percent very interested and 34 percent somewhat interested.&#13;
The survey also provided positive empirical, if anecdotal, evidence of user satis-&#13;
faction with IPAnet and PrivatizationLink. Comments from survey respondents&#13;
included the following observations: "Clearly this service is most important, as ongoing&#13;
updating and researching ... is very time consuming and most cannot afford to carry it&#13;
out"; and, "Thank you for your good work! I am very grateful and use your information&#13;
frequently." Notable developments for each of the services and new global products are&#13;
discussed below.&#13;

THE INVESTMENT PROMOTION NETWORK j wwwipanet.net&#13;
-                              i MIGA's flagship investment promotion Web site, IPAnet, continued to attract&#13;
significant traffic flows in fiscal 2001, averaging some 343,ooo hits a month over the&#13;
year. The site's performance was particularly strong in terms of amount of time that&#13;
users spent on each visit, averaging 18 minutes. Page views, the number of pages or&#13;
screens loaded, were also strong and stable over the period at about 250,000&#13;
impressions per quarter.&#13;
With some 19,000 registered users from around the globe, and thousands more&#13;
visiting the site on a regular basis, IPAnet has become the central location for FDI infor-&#13;
mation on the Web. Content on the site has expanded substantially with new&#13;
documents and links added to keep the site current to encourage repeat use, a partic-&#13;
ularly important feature. Of the more than io,ooo entries catalogued in&#13;
IPAnet/PrivatizationLink databases, over 34 percent are related to IDA-eligible&#13;
countries. On a regional basis, Sub-Saharan Africa as well as Eastern Europe and&#13;
Central Asia are particularly well represented.&#13;
Also during the year, MIGA completed an extensive set of upgrades to the&#13;
operating system and application software underlying MIGA's online investment&#13;
information services. This effort also included updating several of the Web-based appli-&#13;
cations and automating many routine maintenance functions to increase operating&#13;
efficiency and cope with the rising volume of site visitors and registrants to the agency's&#13;
online services.&#13;

P *                              :  group, the new version of PrivatizationLink, launched in April 2001, includes&#13;
enhancements in Web site design and navigation, as well as significant upgrades in&#13;
content and functionality. In particular, the requirement to register in order to access&#13;
much of the site has now been eliminated. Registration is only required to access the&#13;
Business Directory and to enable the personalization of content presented.&#13;
Enhancements to the site are numerous. Special entryways into the data have&#13;
been added, catering to the needs of its target audience. The new Practitioners' Corner&#13;
is targeted to users involved in structuring transactions, such as privatization agency&#13;
personnel, and contains a collection of hands-on learning and networking resources,&#13;
as well as templates of company profiles and the World Bank's databank of historical&#13;
transaction statistics for privatization in developing countries. The Investors' Corner is&#13;
aimed at those who want to track investment and advisory opportunities by providing a&#13;
quick snapshot of the latest data, such as tender announcements and procurement&#13;
notices for advisory services. A new personalization option allows investors to cus-&#13;
tomize this feature by sector, region and subject to suit their own requirements.&#13;

MICA has also developed a new Country Fact Sheets collection, offering at-a-glance&#13;
summaries of privatization trends in the regions and of country privatization&#13;
programs. Fact sheets have been completed for all regions, 16 countries in Europe and&#13;
Central Asia and 16 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, three countries in the Middle East&#13;
and North Africa region, and selected other countries.&#13;
FDIXCHANGE&#13;
MIGA completed the technical design for the pilot version of the FDI Xchange, a&#13;
Web- and e-mail-based update service designed to keep investors informed of&#13;
significant new investment opportunities and changes in the business operating envi-&#13;
ronment in developing countries and economies in transition.&#13;
An important element of this initiative involves developing the capability for&#13;
investment promotion entities, privatization agencies, and other content providers to&#13;
catalog their new information resources directly into IPAnet and the new e-mail&#13;
service through an online interface. MIGA plans an intensive program of short-term&#13;
assistance to these content providers as part of the deployment of the new service.&#13;
MI GA met with several potential marketing partners (e.g., development finance insti-&#13;
tutions and outward IPAs) as well as potential content providers to identify a core&#13;
group of partners to participate in the pilot phase of the service, which is scheduled for&#13;
fiscal 2002.&#13;
INVESTMENT PROMOTION TOOLKIT&#13;
MIGA's Investment Promotion Toolkit was formally launched at the Sixth Annual&#13;
General Meeting of WAIPA in Geneva. The event was convened in March 2001 and&#13;
attended by 96 people representing 48 IPAs in more than 40 countries.&#13;
The Toolkit is a compilation of best practice in investment promotion, covering&#13;
the full range of activities from establishing an IPA through image building, investor&#13;
targeting and outreach, establishing linkage programs, and implementing monitoring&#13;
and evaluating programs. The how-to guide was developed by MIGA and is provided to&#13;
clients to support and supplement its capacity-building program and is also available&#13;
for sale through the World Bank publications office (see box 3).&#13;
SECTORAL RESEARCH&#13;
During the past year, MIGA undertook to expand its compendia of online sectoral&#13;
resources for investor research, in cooperation with the Joint Library of the World&#13;
Bank and International Monetary Fund. MIGA carried out a program of research to&#13;
identify and assess online sectoral information sources, both free and fee-based, that&#13;
would be of use to the staff of investment promotion intermediaries as they identify&#13;
potential investors and benchmark their attractiveness to investors in specific&#13;
sectors.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
technical assistance services&#13;
The output of this research consists of analyses and hyperlinks to relevant Web&#13;
sites featuring competitive, industry, and company data, compiled for eight selected&#13;
sectors electronics, automotive components, IT services, apparel, food processing,&#13;
telecommunications, tourism, and mining. The sectors were chosen based on several&#13;
selection criteria: the sector's importance for FDI in terms of number of employees, in&#13;
terms of foreign assets, as well as sectoral research needs communicated by MIGA&#13;
clients.&#13;
The objective ofthe research is twofold: to deepen MIGA's sector-specific database&#13;
and to be able to offer clients new tools to use in conducting their strategic planning&#13;
and investor targeting. These sectoral research resources will be employed in MIGA's&#13;
training sessions, such as Internet workshops and skills training seminars on how to&#13;
carry out sectoral targeting campaigns.&#13;
These new resources were tested during the Internet Workshop for Europe and&#13;
Central Asian IPAs held at the end of September 2000. In hands-on exercises during&#13;
the workshop, they proved to be tremendously useful when carrying out sectoral&#13;
research tasks. MIGA plans to continue developing these research resources in addi-&#13;
tional sectors,&#13;
G8 DOT FORCE&#13;
MIGA was invited to participate as part of the World Bank representation to the second&#13;
plenary meeting of the Digital Opportunities Task Force (DOT Force), which was held&#13;
in Cape Town, South Africa. The DOT Force is a G8 initiative, bringing together repre-&#13;
sentatives from the public, private and not-for-profit sectors from G8 and selected&#13;
developing countries. The objective of the task force is to prepare a report with concrete&#13;
recommendations on how the G8 can contribute to creating digital opportunity for all&#13;
and bridging the global digital divide, for presentation and discussion at an upcoming&#13;
G8 summit. MIGA outlined its use of online information services for promoting FDI&#13;
into the developing world and participated in discussions on the need for new&#13;
financing and risk management instruments to facilitate increased technology&#13;
investment into emerging economies.&#13;

MIGA's Legal Affairs and Claims Department&#13;
assists member countries on matters related&#13;
to foreign investment, provides legal advice to&#13;
MIGA underwriters regarding the issuance of&#13;
insurance coverage, and handles claims for compensation brought under contracts issued by MIGA.&#13;
The first claim since MIGA's establishment was filed in the previous fiscal year. The&#13;
claim was brought by Enron Corp. for loss as a consequence of the suspension by&#13;
Indonesia of an independent power project in eastern Java in which Enron had&#13;
invested. The claim arose under the expropriation coverage that MIGA issued to&#13;
Enron in 1997. Enron's power project was unavoidably swept up in the economic&#13;
turmoil that affected Indonesia at the end of the past decade.&#13;
For more than a year after receipt of notice of the claim, MIGA pursued dis-&#13;
cussions with Enron and Indonesia to find a mutually acceptable solution to the&#13;
dispute. When the "cooling off" period set out in the insurance contract expired,&#13;
MIGA became obligated to pay the claim. Talks continued for some time&#13;
nonetheless, as both parties sought to restructure their relationship in a way that&#13;
would have permitted the claim to be withdrawn. With Indonesia's economic sit-&#13;
uation deteriorating and the prospects for financing substantial new infrastructure&#13;
investment made more difficult, mediation talks were terminated in mid-2000. In&#13;
accordance with its contractual obligation, MIGA then paid Enron $15 million for the&#13;
loss it suffered on the project and negotiated a settlement agreement with Indonesia&#13;
by which the loss will be salvaged over a three-year period. Payments under this&#13;
agreement have already commenced, and MIGA has reopened its program in&#13;
Indonesia.&#13;
In addition to those investment disputes in which it is involved as insurer,&#13;
MIGA, in accordance with its Convention, uses its good offices on a selective basis to&#13;
encourage the settlement of other disputes between investors and member countries&#13;
that may be brought to its attention. MIGA staff experienced in resolving conflicts&#13;
relating to foreign investment provided legal assistance and guidance during the&#13;

year to parties from numerous countries that sought creative approaches to the res-&#13;
olution of their investment-related disputes. MIGA's objective in these cases is to&#13;
help resolve disputes before they require formal arbitration.&#13;
At any given time, MIGA's legal staffmay be consulting on as many as a dozen&#13;
investment disputes around the world. A particularly contentious dispute resolved in&#13;
fiscal 2001 illustrates the range of issues that can arise between foreign investors and&#13;
host countries.&#13;
The claimant in Matter of Id reco is an Italian construction and engineering firm&#13;
that won a contract in 1987 to build and operate a water purification plant in&#13;
C6rdoba, Argentina's second most populous province. The project was undertaken&#13;
against a background of considerable economic instability, as the province became&#13;
progressively less able to meet its financial obligations. Relations between the&#13;
parties deteriorated and eventually collapsed entirely, either because of the wrongful&#13;
interpretation of value added tax legislation, as the investor alleged, or because of&#13;
repeated investor defaults, as the province contended. M I GA worked with the parties&#13;
for four years to bring them eventually to an amicable settlement that resolved the&#13;
investment dispute.&#13;
Talks on several other matters are now reasonably well advanced. Mediation is&#13;
normally a more expeditious form of a dispute resolution than arbitration, but&#13;
when the issues are complex or a host country is challenged to rethink substantial&#13;
elements of its economic policies, settlement talks can drag on for several years&#13;
until the parties become comfortable enough with the results of their efforts to&#13;
strike a deal.&#13;
The involvement ofMIGA as a mediator ofiinvestment disputes may also relate&#13;
to a general situation that jeopardizes the ability of a particular member country to&#13;
attract foreign investment. This is the role that the agency is playing with respect to&#13;
the expropriations of foreign investments by the Mengistu regime in Ethiopia some&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
legal services&#13;
27 years ago, where a number of expropriated foreign investors have been trying&#13;
unsuccessfully to obtain compensation.&#13;
In October 2000, MIGA and the government of Ethiopia concluded a&#13;
Memorandum of Understanding by which MIGA was appointed mediator in an&#13;
effort to find a solution to this ongoing problem. As of May 31, 2001, the deadline set&#13;
by MIGA for registration of claims, more than 70 claimants had requested inclusion&#13;
in the mediation process. MIGA has analyzed the evidence submitted by the&#13;
claimants and is reviewing it with the Ethiopian authorities. Once the process is&#13;
finished, the claimants and Ethiopia will hopefully be able to find, with MIGA's&#13;
assistance, a solution for resolving these long-standing disputes. Such a resolution&#13;
would also make a significant contribution to the development of the international&#13;
law of dispute resolution.&#13;
The cases that are now advancing toward resolution, in Ethiopia and elsewhere,&#13;
suggest that MIGA's mediation facilities are filling a gap in the international law&#13;
remedies currently available to foreign investors in their disputes with host&#13;
countries. Diplomatic solutions are not practical for some, and formal arbitration&#13;
may be too costly for others. Mediation, which is voluntary, informal, and inex-&#13;
pensive, increasingly is recognized as an attractive alternative for the resolution of&#13;
investment disputes.&#13;
Upon the request of member states, MIGA advises on the negotiation of&#13;
bilateral investment treaties and other investment-related issues. In addition, during&#13;
the past fiscal year, MIGA's lawyers lectured at law schools in Argentina, Bermuda,&#13;
China, Colombia, Greece, Malaysia, Singapore, Spain, Turkey, and the United States&#13;
and spoke to numerous conferences and workshops to promote foreign investment.&#13;

A new Policy and Evaluations Office was created at the&#13;
beginning of fiscal 2001 to facilitate independent&#13;
assessments of the impacts of MIGA-guaranteed&#13;
investments, to further ensure the independent review&#13;
of environmental impacts of prospective and current&#13;
MIGA projects, and to better coordinate policy formulation with other parts of the World Bank Group.&#13;
ENVIRONMENT&#13;
MIGA goes to great lengths to ensure that all guaranteed projects comply with all&#13;
relevant environmental policies and guidelines. This year, MIGA's environment&#13;
officers undertook due diligence reviews of, and provided clearance for, 50 prospective&#13;
MIGA guarantees. Announcements of the availability of Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessments for all new sensitive (Category A) projects considered by MIGA during&#13;
fiscal 2001 were posted on MIGA's Web site. MIGA worked cooperatively with IFC's&#13;
environment staff on joint environmental reviews of several MIGA-IFC projects.&#13;
DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS&#13;
As detailed in the "MIGA in Focus" chapter, assessing the developmental impacts of&#13;
MIGA-supported projects is a vital part of ensuring that MIGA is fulfilling its develop-&#13;
mental mission. The Operations Evaluation Unit continued the efforts of previous&#13;
years by monitoring and evaluating 12 projects in Colombia, Guatemala, Pakistan,&#13;
Peru, Romania, and Venezuela, underwritten during fiscal 1990-1997. Descriptions&#13;
and assessments of MIGA activities in Bulgaria, Haiti, and Russia were coordinated&#13;
with the evaluation efforts of the World Bank's Operations Evaluations Department.&#13;

box 9 COMPLIANCE ADVISOR/OMBUDSMAN&#13;
Duringfiscal 2000, anew I FC-MIGA Office ofthe ComplianceAdvisor/Ombudsman (CAO) was created.&#13;
The CAO promotes better accountability to people affected by IFC and MIGA projects. It is an inde-&#13;
pendent office, reporting directly to the president, rather than to IFC or MIGA management. The CAO&#13;
carries out its function in three ways: by serving as ombudsman, responding to concerns from outside&#13;
the organization; by advising on compliance with safeguard policies; and by auditing compliance with&#13;
those policies. Its mandate is to assist people affected by IFC- and MIGA-supported projects by&#13;
addressing complaints in a fair, objective, and constructive manner and to enhance the social and envi-&#13;
ronmental impact of such projects.&#13;
In its advisory role, the CAO provides informal and formal advice on policies, procedures, practice,&#13;
and projects, an activity that does not prejudice the involvement of the CAO in its other roles. During&#13;
fiscal 2001, MIGA was subject to a compliance review, which covered the Antamina project in Peru and&#13;
was pleased with the review's findings regarding MIGA's approach to environmental due diligence&#13;
during underwriting.&#13;
Using its flexibility, the CAO also seeks to develop mechanisms to resolve complainants' issues and&#13;
to avoid future problems. This maytakethe form ofnegotiations, mediation, orfact-finding involving IFC&#13;
and MIGA staff, project sponsors, and the affected parties. To ensure that people who need the CAO's&#13;
services know how to access them, the CAO is now making its operational guidelines available in print&#13;
and electronically in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.&#13;
POLICY COORDINATION&#13;
Ensuring proper coordination of activities among various World Bank Group members&#13;
is crucial to effectively utilizing MIGA's resources and avoiding duplication of others'&#13;
services. To that end, M IGA staffparticipated in many joint task forces (for example, on&#13;
assistance to middle-income developing countries). Additionally, MIGA officers took&#13;
part in joint missions and conferences and gave presentations on MIGA's activities to&#13;
a variety of audiences, from government ministers to university students.&#13;

box io EVALUATION EFFORTS-A CASE STUDY *&#13;
KASESE COBALT COMPANY LTD. (KCCL), Uganda&#13;
KCCL is one ofthe larger projects in MIGA's portfolio in Africa. It is a prime example of how private and&#13;
public resources can be combined to make a significant contribution to the development process. After&#13;
several years of planning and construction, the plant began to produce high-quality cobalt from&#13;
stockpiled concentrates generated by an old mining operation in southwestern Uganda in November&#13;
1999. KCCL was visited by a MIGA monitor in April 2000 as part of MIGA's ongoing project evaluation&#13;
program. The evaluation found that this project has already generated significant developmental&#13;
benefits for an economically depressed area in a highly indebted poor country. It has successfully&#13;
improved the environment by stopping contamination and erosion stemming from inadequate storage&#13;
of stockpiles left by a closed copper mine. The project is also noteworthy as a large, high-profile&#13;
investment that began at a relatively early stage of Uganda's economic reform program. The project's&#13;
success is an example of how coordinated efforts by members ofthe World Bank Group, efficiently com-&#13;
bining their specialized instruments, can yield desirable development outcomes.&#13;

Between fiscal 1992 and 1998, MIGA issued sixguaranteesfor several equity investors and lenders&#13;

often have.                          of about $49 million.&#13;
MIGA's early involvement with the project in 992 created a favorable environment for IFC, which&#13;
subsequently supported KCCL with a loan of $16 million and $3.6 million in equity. Supplementing the&#13;
involvement of private investors and lenders, MIGA, and IFC are the European Investment Bank (EIB),&#13;
and the French government development agency, PROPARCO. MIGA insurance was essential for&#13;
securingdebt financingfrom private banks forthe construction ofthe project. The project isalsoan inter-&#13;
esting case in point for private-public partnership since private investors, development institutions, and&#13;
the government of Uganda all hold shares in the company.&#13;

DIRECT IMPACTS The Kasese project is one of the largest direct investments in the country to date. It&#13;
is expected to generate even more significant developmental impacts on the economy of Uganda and its&#13;
impoverished southwestern region. MIGA evaluations staff found that the project has already been even&#13;
more effective than initially estimated. The project employs 326 people, significantly more than the 200&#13;
initially anticipated. The plant will also have a positive impact on Uganda's balance of payments, by&#13;
providing an estimated $35 million per year in export revenues in a country still heavily dependent on&#13;
coffee exports. Government revenues will benefit from duties, taxes, and dividends. The exact magnitude&#13;
of those contributions, however, will depend on the world price of cobalt, which has shown considerable&#13;
volatility. Additionally, the project is implementing a training program that teams local "understudies"&#13;
with each managerial, technical, and professional position. This will provide back-up staff and should&#13;
facilitate the gradual replacement of expatriates with Ugandans.&#13;
KCCL has already spent more than $2.5 million to prevent further damage to the environment as a&#13;
result of leaks from the improperly stored stockpiles it inherited. Years of neglect had caused stockpiled&#13;
material to be washed downslope, threatening local communities, a habitat in a nearby lake, and a&#13;
National Park. This erosion has been stopped through the implementation of a closure and rehabilitation&#13;
plan. The environmental situation is expected to improve further as stockpiled material is being&#13;
processed by the plant, removing the major source of pollution. KCCL has also acted as a catalyst for&#13;
innovative environmental projects in the area. For example, it has initiated and supported revegetation&#13;
schemes and a wetlands project that will benefit the region in future years.&#13;

INDIRECTANDDIFFUSED EFFECTS The Kaseseprojectisfosteringsocialdevelopmentand infra-&#13;
structure improvements in the local community. Several anticipated benefits have already been realized,&#13;
such as improved access to clean water and low-cost power. The project has also attracted unanticipated&#13;
community development funding from the EIB for several local improvement projects, including the&#13;
establishment and upgrading of local health centers, the construction of bridges, and pavement of dirt&#13;
roads. The company estimates that economic activities valued at approximately $6oo,ooo are injected&#13;
annually into the local economy from employees' wages. The company has also successfully imple-&#13;
mented a new and innovative technology (bio-oxidation), which is considered an environmental best&#13;
practice.&#13;
Diffused effects, which by their very nature are difficult to measure, are significant for this project,&#13;
particularly with regard to the demonstration effect of a successful foreign investment in Uganda. As&#13;
one of the earliest major foreign investments in Uganda, it accounted for more than 1o percent of total&#13;
private foreign investment into the country from 1990 to 1998. The project has received numerous&#13;
awards from the government. There is no doubt that this project has contributed to the enhancement&#13;
of Uganda's investment image by sending a positive signal to other potential investors. It also demon-&#13;
strates to other investors considering projects in developing countries that collaboration between&#13;
private companies and banks, as well as multilateral and developmental institutions, can be very&#13;
effective-resulting in both a commercial success for the private investors and lenders and an&#13;
improvement of the host country's economy.&#13;

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW&#13;
INCOME FROM GUARANTEES&#13;
MIGA's income from guarantees, comprising earned net premium income, fees and commissions,&#13;
increased by $6.9 million to $36.5 million. This reflected the level of Net Exposure and reinsurance at the&#13;
end of fiscal 2000, rather than growth during fiscal 2001, because the latter was substantially concen-&#13;
trated in the last month of the fiscal year.&#13;
INVESTMENT INCOME&#13;
MIGA's investment income increased from $23.5 million to $30.4 million in fiscal 2001 reflecting: (i) the&#13;
growth of the investment portfolio from $464 million to $552 million, and (2) the investment return,&#13;
which increased from 5.3 percent to 7.5 percent (or 6.o percent excluding unrealized gains). The average&#13;
maturity of the investment portfolio in fiscal 2001 was 11.1 months, and unrealized investment gains&#13;
accruing during the year amounted to $7.7 million.&#13;
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES&#13;
Total administrative expenses amounted to $i1.8 million, compared with a budget of $22.1 million. The&#13;
variance of $2.3 million comprised an unutilized contingency of $o.6 million, benefits savings of $o.8&#13;
million, and a general budget under-run of$o.g million. MIGA plans to carry over $0.3 million into fiscal&#13;
2002 for budget purposes, in respect of spot awards and systems development.&#13;
NET INCOME&#13;
Net Income was $19.6 million in fiscal 2001, compared with $10.9 million in fiscal 2000. The variance&#13;
comprised:&#13;

RESERVE FOR CLAIMS&#13;
MIGA's Reserve for Claims comprised Specific Claims Reserves of $o.5 million and General Claims&#13;
Reserves of $294.6 million.' The provision for claims amounted to $29.7 million and reflected: (i) the&#13;
increase in Net Exposure and reinsurance, offset by a significant increase in estimated future premium&#13;
income, and (2) an adverse adjustment for MIGA's exposure in Argentina.&#13;

LIQUIDITY&#13;
MIGA measures liquidity by reference to: (1) the resources which are available to pay claims ('Sources&#13;
ofCash"), and (2) the capital and reserveswhich are availableto sustain losses and supportthe ongoing&#13;
business ('Operating Capital'). As of June 30, 2001, Sources of Cash totaled $767 million, including&#13;
MIGA's investment portfolio of $552 million, credit facilities of $1io million2, and promissory notes of&#13;
$ioi million. Operating Capital of $653 million comprised General Claims Reserves of $295 million,&#13;
Retained Earnings of $68 million, and Paid-in Capital of $291 million. In addition, MIGA was supported&#13;
by $1,158 million of callable capital.&#13;
CAPITAL INCREASE&#13;
On March 29,1999, M IGA's Council of Governors approved a general capital increase of $850 million, to&#13;
be subscribed over three years. As ofJune 30, 2001, 51 countries had subscribed $33p.0 million, of which&#13;
$58.3 million was in cash and the balance was in the form of callable capital (see p.122 for a complete&#13;
list).&#13;
General Claims Reserves are intended to cover the present value of the inherent probable losses,&#13;
net of related premium income, arising from the existing guarantee portfolio, based on current&#13;
events and developments.&#13;

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
PURPOSE&#13;
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), established on April 12, 1988, is a member ofthe&#13;
World Bank Group which also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
(IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the International Development Association&#13;
(IDA). MIGA's activities are closely coordinated with and complement the overall development&#13;
objectives of the other World Bank institutions. MIGA is designed to help developing countries attract&#13;
productive foreign investment by both private investors and commercially operated public sector com-&#13;
panies. Its facilities include guarantees or insurance against noncommercial risks and a program of&#13;
advisory services and technical assistance to support member countries' efforts to attract and retain&#13;
foreign direct investment.&#13;
Note A I SUMMARY OFSIGNIFICANTACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
MIGA's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with International Accounting Standards&#13;
and with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The policy adopted is&#13;
that considered most appropriate to the circumstances of MIGA having regard to its legal requirements&#13;
and to the practices of other international insurance entities.&#13;
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Accounting&#13;
Standards and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires man-&#13;
agement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial&#13;
statements. Actual results could differfrom those estimates. Thefollowing summaryofpolicies adopted&#13;
by MIGA is provided to assist readers in the interpretation ofthese financial statements.&#13;
Translation of Currencies MIGA's financial statements are expressed in terms of United States dollars&#13;
solely for the purpose of summarizing MlGA's financial position and the results of its operations for the&#13;
convenience of its members and other interested parties.&#13;
MIGA is an international organization that may conduct its operations in the currencies of all its&#13;
members. MIGA's resources are derived from its capital and retained earnings in its members' cur-&#13;
rencies. MIGA strives to minimize exchange rate risks in a multicurrency environment. As such, MIGA&#13;
attempts to match its contingent obligations in any one currency with assets in the same currency on a&#13;
pro-rata basis.&#13;
Accordingly, MIGA may periodically undertake currency conversions on a pro-rata basis to match&#13;
the currencies underlying its reserves with those ofthe outstanding contingencies. The purpose of these&#13;
conversions will be to minimize currency exposure that may occur through operations. Otherwise, MIGA&#13;
will not convert one currency into another except for small amounts required to meet certain operational&#13;
needs.&#13;
Assets and liabilities are translated at market rates of exchange at the end of the period. Capital&#13;
subscriptions are stated in accordance with the procedures described below. Income and expenses are&#13;
generally translated at an average of the market rates of exchange in effect during each month.&#13;
Translation adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.&#13;
Valuation ofCapitalStock Under the MIGA Convention, all payments from members subscribing to the&#13;
capital stock of M IGA shall be settled on the basis of the average value of the Special Drawing Right&#13;
(SDR) in terms of United States dollars for the period january 1,1981 to June 30,1985, such value being&#13;
equal to $1.o82 for one SDR.&#13;
Investments As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, to diversify its credit exposure to com-&#13;
mercial banks and to obtain higher returns, MIGA invests in government and agency obligations and&#13;
time deposits according to its credit risk and maturity policies. Government and agency obligations&#13;
include highly rated fixed rate bonds, notes, bills and other obligations issued or unconditionally guar-&#13;
anteed by governments of countries or other official entities including government agencies or by multi-&#13;
lateral organizations.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
financial statements&#13;
Investments classified as available-for-sale, which are those securities that may be sold prior to&#13;
maturity as part of asset/liability management or in response to other factors, are carried at fair value&#13;
with any changes in fair value reported in the Balance Sheet as a component of other comprehensive&#13;
income.&#13;
Revenue Recognition Revenue from premium payments for dired insurance and reinsurance contracts&#13;
assumed and ceded is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the contract period. Revenue from com-&#13;
mitment fees, which are fees paid by investors to reserve for a limited period of time guarantee capacity&#13;
for future use, is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the commitment period.&#13;
Reserve for Claims The reserve for claims provides for probable losses, net offuture premiums, inherent&#13;
in guarantee operations based upon an estimation of the net present value offuture premium income as&#13;
compared to the net present value of future losses related to guarantee operations. MIGA has incurred&#13;
only one loss to date (see NoteD). Accordingly, MIGA has computed expected future losses by reference&#13;
to (i) the loss experiences of other insurers engaged in similar underwriting, (ii) the composition and&#13;
volume of outstanding guarantee contracts, and (iii) theworldwide economic and political environment.&#13;
This reserve is available to absorb probable losses inherent in outstanding guarantees and is increased&#13;
by provisions charged to expense and decreased by claims settlements.&#13;
The level of provision is based upon management's evaluation of probable losses, net of future&#13;
premiums, that may result from (i) risks that are inherent, but unidentifiable at the time of reporting, (ii)&#13;
unusually large concentrations of exposure to individual risks, countries or guarantee contracts, and (iii)&#13;
an ongoing assessment of MICA's expected recovery rates. Sufficient claims reserves are established at&#13;
theend of each yearto cover all ofthe inherent probable lossesarisingfrom contracts outstanding atthat&#13;
time on a net present value basis; future provisions are then established to reflect changes in M IGA's out-&#13;
standing portfolio.&#13;
In the event of a formal filing of claim by an investor, and upon receipt of full evidence of the&#13;
occurrence ofthe covered risk, MIGA normally has between two months and six months to determine its&#13;
liability under the contract, depending upon the type of coverage and contract terms, and 60 days&#13;
thereafter to pay the claim.&#13;
Accounting and financial reporting developments In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards&#13;
Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accountingfor&#13;
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which, as amended by SFAS Nos. 137 and 138, is&#13;
effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS 133, as amended,&#13;
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative&#13;
instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. Under SFAS 133, certain contracts&#13;
that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative. The Agency&#13;
adopted SFAS 133 effective July 1, 2000. The adoption of SFAS 133 did not have any impact on the&#13;
financial position or results of operations of the Agency.&#13;
In March 1999, the International Accounting Standards Committee issued IAS No. 39, Financial&#13;
Instruments Recognition and Measurement. The Standard prescribes balance sheet recognition of&#13;
all financial assets and financial liabilities, including derivatives. It requires financial assets and financial&#13;
liabilities to be initially measured at cost, and to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet thereafter.&#13;
The Standard is effective for the Agency for the year ending June 30, 2002.&#13;
In September 2000, FASS issued SFAS No. 140, Accountingfor Transfers and Servicing of&#13;
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. SFAS No. 140, which replaces SFAS No. 125,&#13;
Accountingfor Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,&#13;
provides accounting and reporting standards for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets.&#13;
The accounting requirements of the Standard are effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets&#13;
and extinguishments of liabilities after March 31, 2001, and must be applied prospectively. The Agency&#13;
applied the provisions of SFAS No. 140 beginning April i, 2001. The adoption of SFAS No. 140 did not&#13;
have any impact on the Agency's financial position or results of operations for the period.&#13;

Note C I CAPITAL STOCK&#13;
The MIGA Convention established MIGA's authorized capital stock at 100,000 shares with a provision&#13;
that the authorized capital stock shall automatically increase on the admission of a new member to the&#13;
extent that the then authorized shares are insufficient to provide the shares to be subscribed by such&#13;
member. At june 30, 2001, the initial authorized capital stock increased to 102,324(101,843- June 30,&#13;
2000) shares. The Convention further states that 10 percent ofthe members' initial subscription be paid&#13;
in cash, in freely convertible currencies, except that developing member countries may pay up to a&#13;
quarterofthe io percentintheirown currencies. An additional 10 percentofthe initial subscription shall&#13;
be paid in the form of nonnegotiable, noninterest bearing promissory notes. The notes are denominated&#13;
in freely convertible currencies and are due on demand to meet MIGA's obligations. The remaining 8o&#13;
percent is subject to call when required by M IGA to meet its obligations.&#13;
On March 29, 1999, the Council of Governors approved a resolution increasing the authorized&#13;
capital stock of MIGA by 78,559 shares to be subscribed by members during the subscription period&#13;

Note D I GUARANTEE PROGRAM AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES&#13;
Guarantee program. MIGA offers guarantees or insurance against loss caused by noncommercial risks&#13;
(political risk insurance) to eligible investors on qualified investments in developing member&#13;
countries. MIGA insures investments for up to 20 years against four different categories of risk:&#13;
currency transfer, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract. Currency transfer&#13;
protects the investor from inconvertibility of local currency returns and proceeds from the liquidation&#13;
of the investment project into foreign exchange for transfer outside the host country. Expropriation&#13;
protects the investor against partial or total loss ofthe insured investment as a result of acts by the host&#13;
government that may reduce or eliminate ownership of, control over, or rights to the insured&#13;
investment. War and civil disturbance protects the investor against losses from damage to, or the&#13;
destruction or disappearance of, tangible assets caused by politically motivated acts of war or civil dis-&#13;
turbance in the host country. Breach ofcontract protects the investor against the impossibility to obtain&#13;
or to enforce an arbitral or judicial decision recognizing the breach of an obligation by the host gov-&#13;
ernment. Investors may insure projects for any combination ofthe four types of coverage. MIGA guar-&#13;
antees, other than those issued as reinsurance, cannot be terminated unilaterally by the guarantee&#13;
holder within the first three years from the date of issuance. Premium rates applicable to issued con-&#13;
tracts are fixed for five years. Payments against all claims under a guarantee may not exceed the&#13;
maximum amount of coverage issued under the guarantee.&#13;
As approved by the Board of Directors and the Council of Governors, the maximum aggregate&#13;
amount of contingent liabilities that may be assumed by MIGA is 350 percent of the sum of MIGA's&#13;
unimpaired subscribed capital and its reserves plus such portion of the insurance ceded by MIGA&#13;
through contracts of reinsurance as the Board of Directors may determine. Accordingly, at June 30,&#13;
2001, the maximum level of guarantees outstanding may notexceed $8,121,241,000.&#13;
Contingent Liability. The maximum amount of contingent liability of MIGA under guarantees out-&#13;
standing at June 30, 2001 totaled $5,179,040,000 ($4,364,812,000 - June 30, 2000). The maximum&#13;
amount of contingent liability is MIGA's maximum exposure to insurance claims, which includes&#13;
"standby" coverage for which MIGA is committed but not currently at risk. At June 30, 2001, MIA's&#13;
estimate of its actual exposure to insurance claims exclusive of standby coverage is $2,628,939,000&#13;
($2,329,948,000-June30,2000). At june30,2001, approximately37percentofthecontingentliability&#13;
represents guaranteesissued thatwill expireon orafter june30, 2011.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
financial statements&#13;
As of June 30, 2001, additional guarantee capacity committed was nil ($117,000,000 -&#13;
June 30, 2000).&#13;
Claim Activity. In June 2000, MIGA paid its first claim, an expropriation claim related to a power&#13;
project in Indonesia, amounting to $15,000,000, of which 70% was reinsured. The net amount paid&#13;
by MIGA was $4,500,000. MIGA has entered into a settlement agreement with Indonesia under&#13;
which the loss should be repaid in six semi-annual payments of principal and interest on the out-&#13;
standing balance. As at June 30, 2001, in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement,&#13;
two installments totalling $5,825,ooo have been received. MIGA has retained $1,748,000 (30%).&#13;
Note E I REINSURANCE&#13;
Although MIGA obtains quota-share and facultative reinsurance to augment its underwriting capacity&#13;
and to protect portions of its insurance portfolio, it remains responsible to the insured client for the&#13;
entire amount of the insurance contract. Of the $5,179,040,000 outstanding contingent liability&#13;
(gross exposure) as at June 30, 2001 ($4,364,812,000 - June 30, 2000), $2,022,603,000 was ceded&#13;
through contracts of reinsurance ($1,548,856,000 - June 30, 2000). Net exposure amounted to&#13;
$3,156,437,000 as at June 30, 2001 ($2,815,956,000 - June 30, 2000).&#13;
M IGA can also provide both public (official) and private insurers with facultative reinsurance. As&#13;
ofJune 30, 2001, total insurance assumed by MIGA, primarily with official investment insurers,&#13;
amounted to $99,882,000 ($124,472,000- June 30, 2000).&#13;
Estimated reinsurance recoverables have been determined based upon a review ofthe selected&#13;
contracts in force and other available information.&#13;
Premiums relating to direct, assumed, and ceded contracts for the fiscal years ended June 30,&#13;
2001 and June 30, 2000 were as follows:&#13;

Note G I STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN&#13;
The World Bank Group has a defined benefit retirement plan (Plan) covering substantially all of MIGA's&#13;
staff. The Plan alsocovers substantiallyall the staffofIBRD and IFC. Underthe Plan, benefits are based&#13;
on the years of contributory service and the highest three-year average of pensionable remuneration as&#13;
defined in the Plan, with the staff contributing a fixed percentage of pensionable remuneration, and the&#13;
World Bank Group contributing the remainder of the actuarially determined cost of future Plan benefits.&#13;
The actuarial present values of Plan obligations throughout the fiscal year are determined at the&#13;
beginning of the fiscal year by the Plan's actuary. MIGA's total contribution to the Plan is based upon the&#13;
aggregate funding method. All contributions to the Plan and all other assets and income held for the&#13;
purposes of the Plan are held separately from the other assets and income of the World Bank Group and&#13;
can be used only for the benefit of the participants in the Plan and their beneficiaries, until all liabilities&#13;
to them have been paid or provided for. Plan assets consists primarily of equity and fixed income secu-&#13;
rities, with small holdings of cash, real estate and other investments.&#13;
Net periodic pension income allocated to MIGA and included in incomefrom Staff Retirement Plan&#13;
forthe fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 was $2,858,ooo ($2,576,000 - June 30,2000).&#13;
Note H I OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS&#13;
IBRD provides other postretirement benefits for eligible active and retired World Bank Group staff,&#13;
including MIGA. These benefitscan be grouped undertwo majortypes, i.e. health care and life insurance&#13;
benefit and the pensions administered outside of the Staff Retirement Plan (discussed in Note G). IBRD&#13;
hasdesignated assets to fund these liabilities. The assets and liabilitieswere recordedon IBRD's balance&#13;
sheet.&#13;
At June 30, 2001, MIGA has included in other assets an accrued/prepaid postretirement benefits&#13;
cost of$27,600 ($135,000- June3o, 2000) relatingto its share ofthe postretirement benefits net assets.&#13;
Expense resultingfrom the decrease in MIGA's share ofthese net assets forthe fiscal yearended June 30,&#13;
2001 was $162,6O0 ($189,000-June 3o,2000).&#13;

INVESTMENT GUARANTEE GUIDE&#13;
MIGA: BRINGING CLIENTS UNIQUE STRENGTHS&#13;
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) is a member of the World Bank Group. Its purpose is to&#13;
promote foreign direct investment by providing political risk insurance (guarantees) to investors and lenders, and by&#13;
helping emerging economies attract private investment.&#13;
MIGA's unique strengths derivefrom its structure as an international organizationwhose shareholders include&#13;
mostcountries in the world. This enablesthe agency to provide an umbrella of deterrence against government actions&#13;
that could disrupt investments, and allows it to influence the resolution of potential disputes-and ultimately&#13;
enhance investor confidence.&#13;
The agency actively cooperates with public and private political risk insurers through coinsurance and rein-&#13;
surance arrangements for joint coverage of eligible investment projects. These collaborative efforts significantly&#13;
increase available insurance capacity for applicants seekingto expand their businesses in developing countries. MIGA&#13;
can act as the arranger for a project's total insurance requirements.&#13;
WHAT IS ELIGIBLE?&#13;
Investments I MIGA can guarantee new, cross-border investments, as well as investments associated with the&#13;
expansion, modernization, or financial restructuring of existing projects, and acquisitions involving privatization of&#13;
state enterprises. Investments should contribute to host country development objectives and be financially, econom-&#13;
ically, and environmentally sound. Investments must be made in a developing country that is a member of MIGA.&#13;
Eligible forms of investment include equity, shareholder loans, and loan guaranties issued by equity holders,&#13;
provided the loans and loan guaranties have terms of at least three years. Loans to unrelated borrowers can be guar-&#13;
anteed, provided an eligible shareholder registers its investment with MIGA. Other eligible investments include, but&#13;
are not limited to, technical assistance, management contracts, leases, and franchising and licensing agreements,&#13;
provided their contractual commitments have terms of at leastthree years and the remuneration of the investor is tied&#13;
to a large extent to the project's operating results. Sponsors are encouraged to discuss their investment needs with&#13;
MIGA.&#13;
Applicants I An eligible applicant must be a national of a member country other than the country in which the&#13;
investment is to be made. In certain cases, MIGA may also insure an investment made by a national of a host country,&#13;
provided the funds originate from outside the host country and the host government specifically approves the&#13;
investment. Corporations or financial institutions are eligible for coverage if they are either incorporated in and have&#13;
their principal place of business in a member country or if they are majority-owned by nationals of member countries.&#13;
State-owned corporations are also eligible if they operate on a commercial basis.&#13;
WHAT POLITICAL RISKS ARE COVERED?&#13;
Currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction I Protects against losses arising from an investor's inability to&#13;
convert local currency (capital, interest, principal, profits, royalties, and other remittances) into foreign exchange for&#13;
transfer outside the host country. The coverage also insures against excessive delays in acquiring foreign exchange&#13;
due to host government action or failure to act. Currency depreciation is not covered. On receipt of the blocked&#13;
currency from an investor, MIGA pays compensation in the currency specified in the contract of guarantee.&#13;
Expropriation I Protects against lossesarising from host government actions that may reduce or eliminate ownership&#13;
of, control over, or rights to the insured investment. In addition to outright nationalization and confiscation,&#13;
"creeping" expropriation-a series of acts that, overtime, have an expropriatory effect-is also covered. Coverage is&#13;
availableon a limited basis for partial expropriation (e.g., confiscationoffunds ortangibleassets). Bonafide, non-dis-&#13;
criminatory measures by the host government in the exercise of legitimate regulatory authority are not considered to&#13;
be expropriatory.&#13;
For total expropriation of equity investments, MIGA pays the net book value of the insured investment. For&#13;
expropriation offunds, MIGApaysthe insured portion ofthe blocked funds. For loans and loan guaranties, MICAcan&#13;
insure the outstanding principal and any accrued and unpaid interest. Compensation will be paid upon assignment of&#13;
the investor's interest in the expropriated investment (e.g., equity shares or interest in a loan agreement) to MIGA.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
appendices&#13;
War and civil disturbance I Protects against loss from, damage to, or the destruction or disappearance of, tangible&#13;
assets caused by politically motivated acts ofwar or civil disturbance in the host country, including revolution, insur-&#13;
rection, coups d'etat, sabotage, and terrorism. War and civil disturbance coverage also extends to events that, for a&#13;
period set forth in the contract of guarantee, result in an interruption of project operations essential to overall project&#13;
financial viability. Business interruption coverage is effective when the investment is considered a total loss; at that&#13;
point, MIGA will pay the book value ofthe total insured equity investment.&#13;
For equity investments, M IGA will pay the investor's share of the least of the book value of the assets, their&#13;
replacement cost, and the cost of repair ofdamaged assets. For loans and loan guaranties, MIGAwill pay the insured&#13;
portion ofthe principal and interest payments in default as a direct result of damage to the assets ofthe project caused&#13;
by war and civil disturbance or as a result of business interruption caused by covered events.&#13;
Breach of contract  Protects against losses arising from the host government's breach or repudiation of a contract&#13;
with the investor. In the event ofan alleged breach or repudiation, the investor must-be able to invoke a dispute reso-&#13;
lution mechanism (e.g., an arbitration) set out in the underlying contract and obtain an award for damages. If, after a&#13;
specified period oftime, the investor has not received payment or ifthe dispute resolution mechanism fails to function&#13;
due to host government actions, MICA will pay compensation. MIGA may make a provisional payment pending the&#13;
outcome of the dispute resolution mechanism.&#13;
The coverages described may be purchased individually or in combination, but selection of the desired cov-&#13;
erages must be made by an investor before MIGA issues its guarantee.&#13;
WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF COVERAGE?&#13;
Pricing I MIGA prices to risk, and premium rates are decided on a per project basis, usually ranging between 30 and&#13;
loo basis points per risk (up to 150 in some cases) per year. Premiums are paid at the beginning of each contract&#13;
period.&#13;
Duration ofguarantee I MIGA provides coverage for up to 15 years (and possibly 20 years ifjustified by the nature of&#13;
the project). MIGA cannot terminate the contract unless the guarantee holder defaults on its contractual obligations&#13;
to MIGA, but the guarantee holder may reduce or cancel coverage on any contract anniversary date starting with the&#13;
third.&#13;
Amountofcoverage l Forequity investments, MIGA may guarantee upto go percentofthe investment, plus upto an&#13;
additional 450 percentofthe investment contribution to coverearnings attributable to the investment For loans and&#13;
loan guaranties, the agency generally offers up to 95 percent of the principal (or higher as determined on a case-by-&#13;
case basis), plus up to an additional 135 percentofthe principal to cover interest that accrues overthe term oftheloan.&#13;
For technical assistance contracts and other contractual agreements, MIGA may insure up to go percent of the total&#13;
value of payments due under the insured agreement (up to 95 percent in exceptional circumstances).&#13;
Regardless ofthe nature ofthe project, an investoris required to remain at riskfor a portion of any loss fordebt&#13;
and equity. MIGA can currently issue up to US$20o million of coverage (including amounts obtained through treaty&#13;
reinsurance) on its own for a single project. The agency can, however, arrange additional coverage through its rein-&#13;
surance and coinsurance programs with other political risk insurers, including through its Cooperative Underwriting&#13;
Program, a form of coinsurance in which MIGA is the insurer-of-record among participating underwriters.&#13;
