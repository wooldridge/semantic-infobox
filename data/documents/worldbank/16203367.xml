For grants funding this study, the author thanks the Bank Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP) and Japan Policy and&#13;
Human Resource Development (PHRD). The overall project was guided by John Lamb (ARD) and at the later stage by&#13;
Grahame Dixie (ARD). Valuable support was provided by consultants Jian Zhang, FranÃ§ois Kabore, and Ehui Adovor. The data&#13;
on which the report is based were obtained through a survey of the rural investment climate in four countries: Yemen, Burkina&#13;
Faso, Nigeria, and Mozambique.&#13;
&#13;
This study was peer reviewed with comments by Stephen Mink (AFTSN), Kathleen Beegle (DECPI), and Josef Loening&#13;
(AFTAR) at the concept note and decision stage. It was also reviewed with comments by ARD Core Management Committee&#13;
(CMC) members at the concept note stage. Heartfelt thanks go to the specialists who willingly contributed to this review.&#13;
Many considered the task important enough to donate many hours of their scarce time. It has been a pleasure to incorporate&#13;
their views and comments into the review.&#13;

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
An appropriate rural investment climate (RIC) is essential for rural businesses to be successful and generate employment and&#13;
income in their communities. Improving the investment climate could facilitate income-generation activities in both farm and&#13;
nonfarm sectors, thus reducing rural poverty. Nonfarm sectorâ&#128;&#147;focused growth, combined with agricultural growth, has been&#13;
shown by Delgado et al. (1998) to have a significant impact on the local economy through the generation of employment and&#13;
income.&#13;
&#13;
This study is the first to focus on both farm and nonfarm enterprises in its 2010 surveys of RIC in Yemen, Burkina Faso, Nigeria,&#13;
and Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#148;unlike six previous RIC assessment (RICA) pilot projects that focused only on nonfarm enterprises. This&#13;
report assesses the weaknesses and strengths of all RIC components in farm and nonfarm enterprises of the four countries&#13;
surveyed, and recommends measures to address the weaknesses. The report identifies similar business obstacles for farm&#13;
and nonfarm enterprises and four critical areas of the RIC to be improved. The results of the RICA are based on analyses of&#13;
obstacles perceived by rural entrepreneurs and on assessments by RIC indicators, enterprise entry and exit, and enterprise&#13;
performance. To have maximum synergy effects, farm and nonfarm enterprises should be promoted together.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RIC FRAMEWORK&#13;
Based on the recommendations of the six previous projects, a framework was developed to assess the RIC. The frame-&#13;
work divides RIC components into the following categoriesâ&#128;&#148;market development, access to markets, market information,&#13;
womenâ&#128;&#153;s policy, access to finance, access to inputs, management services, agriculture extension services, government&#13;
regulations, infrastructure, and other government-related RIC components (political and economic stability, health, security&#13;
and safety, education, disaster management, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SUGGESTIONS OF THE INTERVENTIONS BASED ON RICAs&#13;
By consolidating the findings of the RICAs (including perceived obstacles, assessment by RIC indicators, enterprise entry and&#13;
exit, and enterprise performance), four areas were identified as in need of improvement: (1) market demand, (2) access to&#13;
markets, (3) access to finance, and (4) business services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(1) Market Demand&#13;

&#13;
       In addition, two other areas stood outâ&#128;&#148;infrastructure (electricity and water) and government regulations (labor, tax rates,&#13;
       tax administration, licenses, permits, registration, and anticorruption measures). Although RICAs showed that government&#13;
       regulations ranked low as perceived obstacles, they will become more significant as more rural enterprises become active&#13;
       and formalized. For example, government regulations may hinder the expansion and operation of businesses in rural areas.&#13;
       The government needs to streamline government regulations in the near future to pave the way for future growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       CONCLUSION&#13;
       Rural businesses, both farm and nonfarm, are becoming an increasingly important source of livelihood in rural areas, but to&#13;
       succeed, they must have a more supportive RIC. Rural entrepreneurs need better access to markets, loans, and manage-&#13;
       ment services if they are to successfully expand their income-generation activities. To accommodate that expansion, market&#13;
       demand has to increase; therefore, any effort to improve the RIC must seek to stimulate demand as well.&#13;

&#13;
An appropriate rural investment climate (RIC) is essential               A recent Ethiopia RIC Assessment (RICA) report identified&#13;
for rural businesses to be successful and to generate em-                nonfarm enterprises as being more often complementary to&#13;
ployment and income in poverty-stricken areas. Improving                 than substitutes for farm enterprises (World Bank 2009b).&#13;
the investment climate would facilitate income-generation                This finding confirms farm and nonfarm growth linkages&#13;
activities in farm and nonfarm sectors, thereby reducing                 identified by Delgado et al. (1998) as contributing positive&#13;
rural poverty.1 The urgency of this task is great in the four            multiplier effects to the local economy in selected Sub-&#13;
countries of Yemen, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and Mozambique,               Saharan African countries. Delgado et al. (1998) showed that&#13;
where the rural poverty rate is much higher than the urban               nonfarm sectorâ&#128;&#147;focused growth, combined with agricultural&#13;

Historically, the primary focus for the rural sector has been            through forward, backward, and consumer-demand linkages&#13;
on agriculture, particularly commercial agriculture and agri-            (Hazell and Haggblade 1993). Often the condition of prevail-&#13;
business, which were perceived to be the main drivers of                 ing low wages obscures the advantages and merits of rural&#13;
rural growth. There was not much interest in other rural                 industrialization; therefore, agriculture often remains the sin-&#13;
enterprises since they were thought to be almost fully de-               gle driver of nonfarm sector growth in rural areas (Reardon&#13;

            Improving the rural investment climate for
            businesses : key to rural income generation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            An appropriate rural investment climate
            (RIC) is essential for rural businesses to be successful and
            generate employment and income in their communities.
            Improving the investment climate could facilitate
            income-generation activities in both farm and nonfarm
            sectors, thus reducing rural poverty. Nonfarm sector focused
            growth, combined with agricultural growth, and has been
            shown by Delgado et al. (1998) to have a significant impact
            on the local economy through the generation of employment
            and income. This study is the first to focus on both farm
            and nonfarm enterprises in its 2010 surveys of RIC in Yemen,
            Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and Mozambique unlike six previous
            RIC assessment (RICA) pilot projects that focused only on
            nonfarm enterprises. This report assesses the weaknesses and
            strengths of all RIC components in farm and nonfarm
            enterprises of the four countries surveyed, and recommends
            measures to address the weaknesses. The report identifies
            similar business obstacles for farm and nonfarm enterprises
            and four critical areas of the RIC to be improved. The
            results of the RICA are based on analyses of obstacles
            perceived by rural entrepreneurs and on assessments by RIC
            indicators, enterprise entry and exit, and enterprise
            performance. To have maximum synergy effects, farm and
            nonfarm enterprises should be promoted together.
