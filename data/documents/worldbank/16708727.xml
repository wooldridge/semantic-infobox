&amp;#12;Foreword&#13;
India is experiencing paradigm shift in rural sanitation with the launch of the Total Sanitation&#13;
Campaign (TSC). Mobilisation, motivation and innovative financial incentives are bringing&#13;
about positive sanitation and hygiene behaviour changes amongst rural communities.&#13;
&#13;
TSC has been able to accelerate the sanitation coverage from a mere 21% as per 2001 Census to&#13;
approximately 67% as of now with over 22,000 PRIs becoming open defecation free â&#128;&#156;Nirmal&#13;
Gramsâ&#128;?. The benefits of investments in sanitation through the Total Sanitation Campaign are&#13;
many but the most endurable will be the long term impact it will have on the health profiles and&#13;
quality of life of our rural population.&#13;
&#13;
While some of the States have shown significant achievement in accelerating the sanitation&#13;
coverage, others need to strengthen their implementation strategies to enhance progress. The&#13;
â&#128;&#152;demand-drivenâ&#128;&#153;, â&#128;&#152;community-ledâ&#128;&#153; and flexible approach of TSC implementation has given an&#13;
opportunity to several states to develop and demonstrate successfully several innovative sanitation&#13;
models. A need was, therefore, felt to document the good practices, lessons learnt and success&#13;
stories from States while implementing the Campaign that may serve as a role model for other&#13;
States to give a boost to their sanitation programme.&#13;
&#13;
This document, prepared in association with Water and Sanitation Programme (WSP), World&#13;
Bank, seeks to capture successful case studies, success stories, and best practices from States on&#13;
TSC implementation which need to be highlighted and replicated in other States.&#13;
&#13;
I am convinced that this document would inspire a new generation of â&#128;&#156;Sanitation Mobilisersâ&#128;?&#13;
who shall be able to translate some of the learnings from these success stories to give greater&#13;
momentum to the sanitation movement for making an Open Defecation Free India.&#13;
&#13;
I wish to place on record our deep appreciation to all the officials of the Government, Panchayati&#13;
Raj Institutions and grassroot sanitation champions of all States who have worked tirelessly for&#13;
ensuring clean surroundings and in becoming a role model for TSC.&#13;

Brief Note on the Contents&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
After a decade of launching the Total Sanitation Campaign, India has seen significant successes in&#13;
terms of the sanitation coverage, creating open defecation communities/GPs and solid and liquid&#13;
waste management. Thousands of success stories have emerged across the country while still&#13;
there are many challenges in making the entire rural India Nirmal and sustaining the changes&#13;
achieved. As part of advocacy and capacity building through knowledge sharing, Govt of India&#13;
with assistance from Water and Sanitation Program has brought out this document by compiling&#13;
various best practices in achieving total sanitation at different levels.&#13;
&#13;
Objectives: The main objectives of the assignment are (a) to identify and document the best&#13;
practices in implementing rural sanitation programme at district/block/GP level and creating and&#13;
sustaining ODF status (b) draw lessons for replications throughout the country by disseminating&#13;
the best practices to achieve sustainable total sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Contents of the compendium: This compendium contains the case studies of best practices&#13;
in achieving total sanitation at different levels, that is, GP/Block/districts. These case studies&#13;
are about the achievements and the experiences of different situations, institutional models,&#13;
community mobilisation approaches, supply chain management, capacity building, convergence&#13;
of various programmes, school sanitation, innovative approaches etc, in different states and&#13;
the regions.&#13;

                                               Fifty-seven-year-old Nirmala was reborn two years ago. Condemned&#13;

                                               only two years ago. Hailing from the Balmiki caste, untouchables&#13;

Bal Panchayats: An Ideal Example of&#13;
Grassroots Democracy and Equity&#13;
Location: Wok Sikkip, Sikkim&#13;
&#13;
The aim of establishing Bal Panchayats is to develop leadership among children, and also to&#13;
develop a sense of responsibility towards their peers and community. It is with this objective that&#13;
the Block Administrative Centre, Sikkip, launched the concept of Bal Panchayats in February&#13;
2010 in 12 schools. Setting an example before the adult members of the gram panchayat (village&#13;
council), children of schools under BAC Sikkip are running a parallel self-government body,&#13;
asserting their right to education, health, entertainment and leisure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                 9&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Facilitated by â&#128;&#152;Bal Sathiâ&#128;&#153; (that is, â&#128;&#152;childrenâ&#128;&#153;s friendâ&#128;&#153;) â&#128;&#147; who is a teacher of the concerned school&#13;
and who works among the children â&#128;&#147; the Bal Panchayats are an ideal example of grassroots&#13;
democracy and equity. The village children have constituted the Bal Panchayat through a general&#13;
election under the supervision of school authorities.&#13;
&#13;
Besides a president, the Bal Panchayat has â&#128;&#152;ministersâ&#128;&#153; for education, health, environment,&#13;
cultural affairs, sports, etc. These ministers are charged with the responsibility of ensuring the&#13;
well-being of the children by bringing the specific problems and needs of the children to the&#13;
notice of the elders and authorities concerned.&#13;
&#13;
Bal Panchayats have helped and persuaded their friends to attend schools; school attendance&#13;
has improved a lot within just two month of starting Bal Panchayats. Bal Panchayats have&#13;
also prepared their Annual Plans for sports meets, cultural programmes and cleanliness drives&#13;
which earlier used to be directly undertaken by the teachers. Bal Panchayats have helped to&#13;
develop leadership qualities among a number of children, inculcated positive values such as the&#13;
importance of equity and social justice, made them aware of the problems of their village, and&#13;
helped them take on responsibilities. After the formation of Bal Panchayats in their schools,&#13;
children on their own have taken the responsibilities of boiling water for drinking purposes in&#13;
the school, with the help of mid-day meal facilities available at the school.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, after the formation of Bal Panchayats in their schools, students have conducted,&#13;
on their own, meetings for various developmental activities to be undertaken in the school. The&#13;
Bal Panchayat of NTL School, for example, is planning to come out with an annual magazine.&#13;
Twelve-year-old Rema Gurung of NTL School was very keen to share the message of the Bal&#13;
Panchayat with her parents at home.&#13;
&#13;
A self-help drive was organised by the Block Administrative Centre for roads, for better toilets&#13;
and better hygiene in Sanganath Secondary School, one of the remotest gram panchayat units.&#13;
After the formation of the Bal Panchayat in this school, an initial round of meetings were held&#13;
with the school authorities and the panchayat for the preparation of user-friendly plans and&#13;
estimates for the construction of the school toilet. For the construction of the toilet, the material&#13;
component was used from the fund that was provided from the government and the labour&#13;
component was covered totally using a participatory mode by school students, teachers, the&#13;
community, and panchayat and block officials. This ultimately built a sense of ownership of the&#13;
asset created in their area â&#128;&#147; a feeling which earlier was missing.&#13;

Sanitation is Dignity: Tribals in Malkangiri&#13;
Show the Way&#13;
Location: Pandripani (Malkangiri District), Odisha&#13;
In Pandripani gram panchayat (GP) of Malkangiri district of Odisha, 19 villages have undergone&#13;
a tremendous change by achieving dignity, convenience and safety for themselves through more&#13;
than a year-long community process.&#13;
&#13;
Pandripani GP, situated in the Naxal-infested Malkangiri district, is surrounded by forests.&#13;
The GP now has the headquarters of the Central Reserve Police Force and a Border Security&#13;
Force camp. Earlier, defecating in the jungles was a way of life. Now, apart from the unhygienic&#13;
repercussions, it has also become a dangerous proposition for the people as they could be caught&#13;
in the crossfire of military combing operations or Naxal forays in the jungles.&#13;
&#13;
This situation prompted the Sarpanch to seek the District Water and Sanitation Missionâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
support in making proper sanitation facilities available to the people. He realised that the process&#13;
of mainstreaming sanitation and hygiene practices in the day-to-day lives of the tribals â&#128;&#147; and&#13;
making life safer and dignified â&#128;&#147; could only happen if it was integrated into the cultural life of&#13;
the tribes.&#13;
&#13;
The process of change was initiated in February 2009. For this, the Sarpanch ingeniously used&#13;
the popular â&#128;&#152;Chaita Parabâ&#128;&#153;, the annual seven-day festival of the tribes, as an entry point for&#13;
sanitation. The traditional mode of revelry and merry-making involved adult males going to the&#13;
forest for hunting prey, with successful hunters being ceremoniously welcomed by their waiting&#13;
wives in the villages.&#13;
&#13;
After initial meetings with villagers and other key opinion leaders, it was agreed that the occasion&#13;
this time would not focus on hunting; instead, every adult male householder would construct&#13;
toilets in their houses within the seven days. The campaign was sustained throughout the festive&#13;
period with traditional drum beating, feasts and dancing. The men were supported in their&#13;
construction drives by their wives and family members. The Ward Members supported the&#13;
supply of raw materials. The anganwadi worker was given the responsibility of door-to-door&#13;
motivation for sustaining the desired behaviour practice of toilet usage. The district officials&#13;
ensured the supply of materials.&#13;
&#13;
The festival ended with a toilet in every house. The men were garlanded with red hibiscus&#13;
garlands by their wives in recognition of this accomplishment.&#13;
&#13;
The Gaon Kalyan Samitis, under the National Rural Health Mission, monitor behaviour through&#13;
regular village meetings and door-to-door visits.&#13;
&#13;
This process, of using local cultural traditions for promoting sanitation, is proposed to be taken&#13;
up in nearby GPs and villages.&#13;

open defecation among the rural communities in its              acknowledging their situation, and collectively vowing&#13;
various districts. This was the situation in a tribal village   to stop open defecation. Natural leaders emerged from&#13;
community in Bagchema village, in the Dasmantpur                among the villagers on the first day, declaring that&#13;

of not more than Rs 100.                                        Sarpanch, on receiving this report, was excited enough to&#13;

Hajipally is a gram panchayat (GP) in Farooqnagar Mandal of Mehboobnagar district, one of the&#13;
most backward districts in Andhra Pradesh. Hajipally, under the leadership of a female sarpanch,&#13;
has achieved total sanitation with access to, and usage of, toilets by 100 percent households. This&#13;
GP become open defecation free (ODF) by 2008 and moved beyond ODF to address other&#13;
issues such as solid and liquid waste management, ensuring cement roads, underground drainage&#13;
and sanitation facilities for all institutions.&#13;
&#13;
The Hajipally GP received the highest award at the state-level under the state reward scheme,&#13;
the â&#128;&#152;Shubram Awardsâ&#128;&#153; by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. It also received the Nirmal Gram&#13;
Puraskar from the Government of India.&#13;
&#13;
How This Village Looks Today&#13;
&#13;
This village has achieved ODF status in 2008 and sustained it; the village is totally clean, without&#13;
any stagnant water either in the streets or any water points. The village has cement roads and&#13;
each house is connected to underground drains with a proper disposal outside the village.&#13;
The people have passed a resolution that the any guest or visitor to the village during fairs or&#13;
ceremonies, such as marriages or family functions, should not defecate in the open. All the school&#13;
toilets/anganwadi toilets have water supply and are well maintained. Drinking water is regularly&#13;
chlorinated in the village.&#13;
&#13;
How Total Sanitation is Maintained&#13;
&#13;
The GP could sustain the change achieved with the following activities by the GP with all the&#13;
stakeholders in the village:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Separate school sanitation facilities for boys and girls, with running water facility.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 School Sanitation and Hygiene Committee maintains degradable and non-degradable&#13;
   dustbins in the school campus.&#13;

&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In winter, youth club members formed teams of four members for monitoring of open&#13;
   defecation practices and camp fires at open defecation places by the Nigrani Committee.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Cleaning of bushes to prevent open defecation in GP jurisdiction and fixing of lights in open&#13;
   defecation area.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Notices issued by the Gram Panchayat Water and Sanitation Committee during fairs and&#13;
   festivals: Guests are not to go outside for defecation. A Rs 500 penalty is being imposed per&#13;
   family if anybody goes outside for defecation.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Visits by many officials, elected representatives of the other villages and the districts have also&#13;
   motivated the GP to maintain the status.&#13;
&#13;
Initiation and Support&#13;
&#13;
The District Support Unit formed under the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) and Swajaladhara&#13;
programmes visited the village in late 2006 and formed a Village Water and Sanitation Committee&#13;
(VWSC) involving the village elders, GP members and the active youth club. The president of&#13;
the youth club played a major role in ensuring the participation of all the young people in the&#13;
programme. Triggering activities using the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) approach had&#13;
been undertaken in the village when the district initiated the CLTS programme under the then&#13;
Collectorâ&#128;&#153;s leadership. This programme was effective in bring people together and triggering behaviour&#13;
change. The VWSC developed a strategy to involve various groups such as youth clubs, womenâ&#128;&#153;s self&#13;
help groups (SHGs), elected representatives from each ward and the informal/community leaders.&#13;
&#13;
Triggering Tools Used&#13;
&#13;
The triggering tools used to bring about a change in the behaviour of the villagers were:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Participatory approaches to trigger the community, such as a walk of shame, and appealing to&#13;
   womenâ&#128;&#153;s dignity.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Health expenditure due to poor hygiene and sanitation, and faecal-oral transmission of diseases.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Interpersonal communication between SHG members, school children and the youth in&#13;
   the village.&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability of Total Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
Total sanitation has been sustained since 2008 due to monitoring by youth club members on a regular&#13;
basis. The GP has introduced a system of penalties for any open defecation either by the villagers or&#13;
visitors/guests to the village; so far, an amount of Rs 2,500 has been collected by the VWSC. These&#13;
penalties were, however, collected in the beginningâ&#128;&#148;now no one defecates in the open.&#13;
&#13;
Health Impacts&#13;
&#13;
There has been a great reduction in the incidence of diarrhoea, typhoid, and other water- and&#13;
sanitation-related diseases in the village.&#13;

Innovative Initiative in Water and Sanitation&#13;
Location: Medepally (Khammam District), Andhra Pradesh&#13;
Medepally village has ignited behavioural change among the community and Panchayati Raj&#13;
Institutions, which is a step forward and a ray of hope of rejuvenation for the village. The gram&#13;
panchayat (GP), under the leadership of the sarpanch, and with the support of community&#13;
leaders, self help groups, youth clubs and officials from all levels, has achieved total sanitation by&#13;
making the GP open defecation free (ODF). This has been further extended to ensure safe water&#13;
to all. This GP has been recognised by various agencies and rewarded for its achievements. The&#13;
important rewards received are: Nirmal Gram Puraskar by the Government of India; Shubram&#13;
Award under a state rewards scheme at mandal and district level by the Government of Andhra&#13;
Pradesh; and Google award from the Google group for achievement in the areas of water supply&#13;

Women Create History: Village Made&#13;
Open Defecation Free in Two Days&#13;
Location: Hoori (Kinnaur District), Himachal Pradesh&#13;
A remote high altitude village called Hoori, Gram Panchayat (GP) Yangpa of Nichar block in&#13;
district Kinnaur of Himachal Pradesh is now a clean village. All the 33 households of the village&#13;
are using toilets and no one defecates in the open. Outsiders who visited village easily sensed&#13;
that the villagers treat sanitation as a public good. If visitors ask villagers pointing to a household&#13;
toilet in the village (which is located close to the pathway and is where the village begins):&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Whose toilet is this?â&#128;&#153;, people usually reply, â&#128;&#156;It belongs to everyone who needs to relieve his/&#13;
herself,â&#128;? â&#128;&#156;In our village, anyone can use any one elseâ&#128;&#153;s toilets, if required.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
There is a rule made by the village sanitation committee (which has mostly women members)&#13;
in the village that everyone, including wage labourers, has to use toilet 100 per cent of the time&#13;
when there is a need to defecate. There is also a penalty/fine (ranging between Rs 500 to&#13;
Rs 1,000 depending upon whether it is the first mistake or a repeated default) for defecating in&#13;
the open. Outside labourers, whenever they arrive, are told by the village committee members to&#13;
first construct a dry pit toilet for themselves and then to do anything else. Cow dung and street&#13;
sweeping are disposed off in allotted places, such as agreed place for community littering, in&#13;
agriculture fields. Everyone has imbibed improved hygiene practices such as handwashing with&#13;
soap and water after defecation, which was earlier almost missing. Hoori village is now neat and&#13;
clean, and all in the village are proud of their achievement.&#13;
&#13;
This was initiated and completed in two days during a five-day training workshop organised by&#13;
the District Rural Development Agency, Kinnaur to train panchayat secretaries and panchayat&#13;
sahayaks. This practice of always using toilets for defecation by all the inhabitants of the village&#13;
as also the migrant labourers (as a rule now labourers construct dry pit toilet for themselves and&#13;
use them), sweeping village lane and streets at regular intervals by women and younger people&#13;
and use of improved hygienic practices were witnessed only after the triggering intervention by&#13;
a group of participants who went for trying out triggering in a real life situation as part of the&#13;
training activity in October 2007.&#13;
&#13;
During the triggering exercise, the community members present were engaged in a self analysis&#13;
of the sanitation profile of the village using a number of participatory exercises such as transect&#13;
walk, disease transmission routes and calculation of medical expenses, etc. The exercise revealed&#13;
that despite 60 per cent households having toilets in their houses (most of them were defunct or&#13;
were being used for bathing), 95 per cent of village population was practicing open defecation.&#13;
As mentioned above, the triggering team used participatory tools to ignite the community by&#13;
helping them in analysing and reflecting on their own sanitation profile. The villagers realised the&#13;
related negative effects of their sanitation behaviour on their dignity and health.&#13;
&#13;
While most community members present during the exercise became silent, two women&#13;
community members, Rajvanti and Vijaylakshmi, said that everyone needs to stop open&#13;
defecation as early as they could, as they donâ&#128;&#153;t want to eat human shit anymore. Surprisingly,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21                                                                                                                                 21&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
after two days of triggering, these two women village natural leader (NLs) along with another NL&#13;
Rameshwar visited the workshop and shared that they have made their village open defecation&#13;
free and invited the participants to see their villageâ&#128;&#153;s transformation. A team of the participants&#13;
including the PO, DRDA, visited the village. During the visit, villagers welcomed them and&#13;
said that â&#128;&#156;you people opened our eyes; earlier we were living like animals; we felt very much&#13;
ashamed on that day.â&#128;? The then PO also encouraged villagers by praising them for their work&#13;
and requested them to motivate people in other villages in the neighbourhood, including their&#13;
relatives in the area.&#13;
&#13;
The villagers shared that they had a meeting the same evening after the triggering team had come&#13;
back and started constructing simple pit toilets with local material and using proper pit cover&#13;
on it. Initially, they completed five toilets in different localities of the village and started sharing&#13;
them and everyone stopped defecating in the open. After five or six months, all the households&#13;
constructed pour flush toilets, including the initial five households that had constructed simple&#13;
pit toilets. It was their upward journey on the sanitation ladder.&#13;
&#13;
There is community participation in mobilising and sustaining the change. Womenâ&#128;&#153;s group, and&#13;
some village youth who were motivated by women, took the initiative to improve the village&#13;
environment. Mahila Mandal (women group) of Hoori also got a cash prize for mobilising and&#13;
sustaining the sanitation gain under state sponsored â&#128;&#152;Mahila Protsahan Yojnaâ&#128;&#153; for promoting&#13;
sanitation in Himachal Pradesh. Women and youth took interest in this; now women are&#13;
monitoring that no one defecates in the open including migrant labourers.â&#128;&#153;&#13;
&#13;
This practice is sustainable; women and a village committee ensure cleanliness in village lanes&#13;
and monitor labourersâ&#128;&#153; behaviour. This practice has been sustainable since the past two years. As&#13;
mentioned above, there is a provision of imposing fine on defaulters; there has been no instance&#13;
of default though. In 2009, the GP Yangpa has applied for NGP.&#13;
&#13;
This practice of triggering is replicated in many villages across Himachal Pradesh. Reportedly,&#13;
the district Kinnaur is on the verge of declaring itself an ODF district using community-led&#13;
approach. The approach has also been successfully used in some other districts/states/countries.&#13;
However, in most cases, triggering alone is not sufficient. Timely and strategic post-triggering&#13;
follow-ups are critical in capitalising upon the desire of collective behaviour change and&#13;
converting it into collective local action.&#13;

Community Mobilisation Leads to&#13;
Open Defecation Free Status in Three Months&#13;
Location: Neen (Shimla), Himachal Pradesh&#13;
Gram panchayat-level best practice: Training and orientation led to community mobilisation.1&#13;
&#13;
Neen gram panchayat (GP), of Basantpur block of Shimla district in Himachal Pradesh, is the&#13;
first GP to receive the state-level sanitation award for achieving fully sanitised status. Since March&#13;
28, 2007, when all the eight villages of the GP declared themselves open defecation free (ODF),&#13;
no one now defecates in the open and visitors are also not allowed to defecate in the open. Efforts&#13;
have moved beyond safe disposal of human excreta to solid and liquid waste management. All the&#13;
households are now making either vermi-compost from cow dung and household waste or using&#13;
simple composting methods. Soak pits have been constructed for grey water wherever required.&#13;
The people are also doing rainwater harvesting to combat water scarcity for toilets and bathrooms&#13;
(around 60 per cent households have constructed roof-top rainwater harvesting structures in their&#13;
houses). There is excellent drinking water management at traditional water sources and households&#13;
level. Improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in the high school are managed by&#13;
the school sanitation club. Womenâ&#128;&#153;s groups organise sanitation drives every month to ensure overall&#13;
cleanliness of the village. A dhaba (hotel) owner manages and ensures, on a voluntary basis, water&#13;
for the pour flush community toilet in the local market for visitors.&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
 Training and orientation of members of Panchayati Raj Institutions on a Community-Led Total Sanitation approach impacted their&#13;
mindsets and they got involved in mobilising the community in a participatory manner, until an ODF environment in the gram panchayat&#13;
was achievement. Then they led further local action for moving beyond ODF to fully sanitised status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                          23&#13;
&amp;#12;From Dreams to Reality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability of improved behaviour is ensured by a village-level sanitation committee by&#13;
involving children and women in the sanitation-related activities and monitoring. The GP&#13;
imposes a penalty of Rs 50 for open defecators and people who litter solid waste in the open.&#13;
&#13;
The demonstrated success of this practice has led to its replication in other GPs of other blocks&#13;
and districts in Himachal Pradesh. People come from outside the state to learn how the GP has&#13;
achieved and is sustaining a fully sanitised status.&#13;
&#13;
This integrated approach had been initiated in January 2007. Although the Total Sanitation&#13;
Campaign (TSC) had been implemented in the GP since January 2006 (after the formation of&#13;
the new GP elected in December 2005), out of 241 households, less than half of households&#13;
(41 per cent) had access to toilets. Only 10 per cent toilets were in use for the purpose they&#13;
were constructed and the remaining were put to alternative uses such as bathing enclosures,&#13;
storehouse, etc. TSC progress on the ground was not satisfactory until December 2006. A&#13;
support organisation hired by the district authorities (Their services were terminated later, as the&#13;
district administration found them ineffective) was working for community mobilisation.&#13;
&#13;
In January 2007, panchayat secretary Mr Bhagwant, under the guidance of the local block&#13;
development officer, formed two teams under the leadership of a zilla parishad (ZP) member and&#13;
the secretary himself (he had received training in Community-Led Total Sanitation, or CLTS).&#13;
They organised triggering sessions initially at two locations (in Neen ward and in Jubbar ward).&#13;
Later, triggering sessions were organised in the other three wards. Door-to-door campaigns&#13;
were undertaken by the natural leaders that emerged during the process. Later, members of all&#13;
community-based womenâ&#128;&#153;s groups (such as Gita of Mahila Mandal) took the lead, followed by&#13;
block development committee, school children, teachers, other trained personnel and district&#13;
administration who supported this initiative.&#13;
&#13;
This effort witnessed good response from community members, particularly women and&#13;
children. Then the triggering teams planned to involve leaders of community-based womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
organisations and school children as part of triggering teams. Follow-up sessions were organised&#13;
in small groups of women by both triggering teams. The focus was on collective realisation of&#13;
linkages between sanitation behaviour and health, and initiating local action without waiting&#13;
for outside help. The block development officer also accompanied the team on some follow-up&#13;
sessions to encourage those villagers who took initiatives to modify their traditional behaviour.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The initial two Mahila Mandals soon triggered the remaining five. These women self-help groups&#13;
and school children visited the difficult/stubborn households, who were unwilling to change, in&#13;
teams and motivated them as and when required.&#13;
&#13;
The GP also displayed newspaper cuttings related to sanitation achievement of other districts&#13;
(such as good work of Killing GP of Mandi, etc) on its notice board, to break the myth that&#13;
eradicating open defecation is difficult. During discussions with visitors and in official meetings&#13;
at the GP office, the members made people realise their dignity. To scale up sanitation in the&#13;
entire GP area, the GPWSC passed a resolution in a special gram sabha to make all the GP&#13;
area ODF by March 31, 2007. Community members were mobilised by using multiple local&#13;
community mobilisation tools, such as, mapping faecal-oral route, anecdotal stories related to&#13;
sanitation, H2S vial and medical expenses, a kalajatha (street play) performance, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
Children formed sanitation clubs in the high school to ensure proper operation and maintenance&#13;
of WASH facilities in schools. A weekly sanitation talk in the morning assembly of schools&#13;
(including the high school and five primary schools) is now a regular feature in Neen GP.&#13;
&#13;
Initially, there was non-cooperation from retired government employees of the GP. They&#13;
perceived the involvement of women in TSC activities as a wastage of time. Gradually, however,&#13;
they realised that people changed their sanitation behaviour due to the efforts of women. They&#13;
came fully on board when they saw that the GP got the first position at block level competition&#13;
of sanitation. Now, all sections and age groups of the community practice safe sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Womenâ&#128;&#153;s groups and panchayat bodies are the main drivers in the GP. For example, the Mahila&#13;
Mandal of Katheru hamlet (30 households, and no one had toilets initially) in Neen village&#13;
undertook an initiative to change the practice of open defecation after a triggering session in&#13;
January 2007. The Mandal members continued follow-ups in their own hamlet and triggering&#13;
in village/ward of Neen until they became ODF. They also did follow-ups in other villages of GP&#13;
on demand. As stated above, initially, only two MMs came forward to promote sanitation but&#13;
now all the seven MMs have undertaken the responsibility. These women groups have helped&#13;
in mobilising unwilling government employees who were not cooperating in the campaign and&#13;
not building or using toilets. School children, teachers and Panchayati Raj Institutionsâ&#128;&#153; (PRI)&#13;
members also worked hard until fully sanitised status was achieved. Villagers and GP members&#13;
encouraged poor households of their village to construct toilets with self-â&#128;&#153;help.&#13;
&#13;
This modified practice is sustainable and is in operation since March 2007. Sustainability is&#13;
ensured by involving the real stakeholders such as school children, womenâ&#128;&#153;s groups, village water&#13;
and sanitation committee members and PRIs in monitoring and encouraging people towards&#13;
improvement in sanitation facilities, especially because their villages are role models for other&#13;
villages. Defaulters of sanitation rules have to pay a fine (Rs 50) in the gram sabha. Mahila&#13;
Mandals and SHGs meet every month as part of group activity and also supervise cleanliness of&#13;
the village paths and surrounding areas by involving other willing community members. A local&#13;
dhaba (hotel) owner has taken the responsibility of ensuring water for the community toilet.&#13;
A new community toilet complex is under construction. Wall painting and slogan writing â&#128;&#147;&#13;
depicting the best hygiene and sanitation behaviour, and life cycle of different type of garbage and&#13;
their possible reuse and safe disposal â&#128;&#147; have been done by the GP at strategic places in the villages&#13;
and local markets to remind visitors and villagers about safe sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
This best practice is being replicated in other GPs of the blocks and districts and in Himachal&#13;
Pradesh. People outside the state visit the GP to learn these best practices. These visits also&#13;
encourage them to ensure sustainability of changed behaviour in respect of sanitation. The people&#13;
of Neen are sustaining their status after having been conferred the first cleanest GP reward of&#13;
Rs 10 lakh under state reward scheme of the Government of Himachal Pradesh in 2007.&#13;

Sanitation Success Stories&#13;
Location: Fatehpur (Block Una, District Una), Himachal Pradesh&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
Fatehpur is one of the first gram panchayats (GPs) of Una district to have won awards under the&#13;
Nirmal Gram Puraskar (NGP) programme of the Government of India, as well as the â&#128;&#152;Maharishi&#13;
Valmiki Sampoorna Swachataâ&#128;&#153; award of the Government of Himachal Pradesh. The awards have&#13;
been given in recognition of its achievements in attaining open defecation free status, ensuring&#13;
complete toilet access and use in its households, schools and anganwadis; and developing&#13;
and maintaining proper solid and liquid waste management systems, with clean and green&#13;
environment around the village. The key attributes of this remarkable success have been a well-&#13;
defined process, effective implementation and monitoring; and, above all, collective commitment&#13;
â&#128;&#147; all of which have put Fatehpur on the road towards total sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Elements of Success&#13;
&#13;
The key elements of the commitment, processes and systems that contributed toward Fatehpurâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
success are:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Initiation of planning process based on situation analysis which revealed that despite having&#13;
   access to toilets (164 out of 190 households had access), a majority of them were practicing&#13;
   open defecation resulting in filth and dirt in and around the village and spreading diseases.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The findings of the situation analysis helped in fine-tuning the strategies from construction&#13;
   driven to behavior change approach, which saw massive investment in generating awareness&#13;
   using various communication tools such as street plays, community meetings, audio-&#13;
   visuals, wall writing, posters, etc. Household-level meetings with individual and families&#13;
   also played a critical role. The partnership approach adopted saw the involvement of youth&#13;
   clubs, womenâ&#128;&#153;s groups and self help groups (SHGs) in mobilising the community to adopt&#13;
   sanitary behaviour. In particular, youth were mobilised and motivated for the upkeep and&#13;
   maintenance of religious places, schools, anganwadis, sports grounds, etc. Teachers and&#13;
   students too have participated in this initiative with great impact. The key messages of&#13;
   mobilisation were dignity and health of women and panchayat.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Setting up a robust institutional mechanism to implement and monitor the total sanitation&#13;
   initiative by creating sanitation committees both at GP and ward levels. These committees were&#13;
   provided technical assistance by engaged support organisation of the district administration.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The enabling role of district and block administration with support of line departments such&#13;
   as rural development, education, public health and others, have contributed tremendously to&#13;
   the success of the total sanitation drive in Fatehpur.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Regular monitoring by GP, block and district officials has ensured sustainable behaviour change.&#13;

Location: Sain ke Sere (Block Nahan, District Sirmour), Himachal Pradesh&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
Sain ke Sere GP, with 256 households distributed in five wards of Sirmour district has shown&#13;
remarkable progress in achieving the goals of total sanitation within a very short time. The&#13;
â&#128;&#152;Maharishi Valmiki Sampoorna Swachataâ&#128;&#153; award of the Government of Himachal Pradesh, won&#13;
by the panchayat in 2008 at the block level, is a reflection of its commitment and hard work.&#13;
Later, this helped the GP in winning the NGP in the same year.&#13;
&#13;
Elements of Success&#13;
&#13;
This successful initiative has hinged upon four very critical components:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Realistic goal setting by the stakeholders has helped in bringing clarity, commitment and&#13;
   resources to set up the initiative in the panchayat.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Social mobilisation structured within the community-led total sanitation approach using&#13;
   triggering tools has played a particularly key role in changing the behaviour of the community&#13;
   â&#128;&#147; an approach adopted by the district administration to scale up the sanitation programme&#13;
   within the district. The implementation of the social mobilisation approach had a very&#13;
   systematic process flow, starting with the initial sensitisation of the panchayat president, ward&#13;
   members and panchayat secretary, followed up with community triggering processes and mass&#13;
   awareness programmes using â&#128;&#152;kala jathasâ&#128;&#153;, etc.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Learning from experience has been one of the key processes that was adopted to understand&#13;
   the bottlenecks in changing sanitary behaviour, which was still favoring open defecation,&#13;
   especially in the absence of motivation and participation from its key stakeholders like&#13;
   panchayat functionaries, youth and womenâ&#128;&#153;s groups, SHGs, etc. Realising this, intensive&#13;
   mobilising was done under the leadership of the panchayat president, and supported by other&#13;
   officials to promote sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Monitoring of the progress by the ward members was one of the highlights that ensured&#13;
   sustained adoption as well as usage of the toilet facilities.&#13;

&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Do not follow others. Make your own way and let the others follow.â&#128;? This saying felicitates&#13;
Shamra GP that has set an example in the sanitation programme through its remarkable&#13;
achievements, by winning the â&#128;&#152;Maharishi Valmiki Sampoorna Swachataâ&#128;&#153; award at the block and&#13;
district levels as well as receiving the NGP in 2008. With these achievements, it has forced others&#13;
to follow in their footsteps. For example, some GPs, like Chokar and Sangraha, have replicated&#13;
the lessons learnt during the implementation of Shamraâ&#128;&#153;s initiatives and reaped huge benefits in&#13;
achieving total sanitation outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
Elements of Success&#13;
&#13;
The key elements of success have been:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Commitment to practice was one of the key drivers for sustaining the demand creation&#13;
   drive. This was initially doubted by the community but the persistent effort of Community-&#13;
&#13;
34&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                            Compendium of Best Practices in Rural Sanitation in India&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Led Total Sanitation trained motivators at the block level changed the perception of the&#13;
   community, and later behavior, towards sanitation. The support and hard work of natural&#13;
   leaders within the community further strengthened the resolve; as a result, within three-four&#13;
   months (April to July 2007), the entire GP was declared open defecation free.   &#13;
â&#128;¢	 Effective programming was another key factor, especially for of setting up sanitation&#13;
   committees for implementation and monitoring at panchayat and ward levels, supporting&#13;
   poor families in constructing toilets, etc.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 To ensure sustainability in gains made in sanitation; the panchayat has also worked on issues&#13;
   of solid and liquid waste management in terms of providing dustbins, bio-gas, composting&#13;
   pits, systems of rain water harvesting, etc. And to maintain cleanliness and open defecation&#13;
   free status, it has also introduced penalties on individuals if violating the status.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Community-based monitoring was another important factor that helped the panchayat to ensure&#13;
   greater sustainability of gains made. This was effectively supported by children and womenâ&#128;&#153;s groups&#13;
   who were engaged to monitor the facilities within the schools and community, respectively.&#13;

&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
Janutipalri and Kasani GPs, which were once characterised by dirt and filth, resulting in&#13;
epidemic form of diarrhoea and dysentery, now present altogether a different story with their&#13;
achievements in sanitation that changed the face and fate of these GPs. With increased sanitation&#13;
access to all households, anganwadis and schools, and elimination of open defecation, today the&#13;
panchayats are healthier and cleaner â&#128;&#147; especially happier because of the recognition given by the&#13;
NGP for their achievements in sanitation. These GPs were given the NGP in 2009.&#13;
&#13;
Elements of Success&#13;
&#13;
The key elements of success have been:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Focus on behavior change was one of the key strategies to promote sanitation in these&#13;
   panchayats, which received tremendous support from the â&#128;&#152;Swajal programmeâ&#128;&#153; in mobilising&#13;
   families, students and others. Community meetings, street plays, as well as rallies by students&#13;
   and womenâ&#128;&#153;s groups, consolidated the commitment of the community to adopt improved&#13;
   sanitation practices, particularly sanitary toilets, and become a â&#128;&#152;Nirmalâ&#128;&#153; gram.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The committed leadership of the GP has also played a key role in sustaining the efforts. The&#13;
   panchayat leaders themselves took the lead in this efforts. This motivated the villagers to keep&#13;
   their areas clean and green.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Regular monitoring has also helped in addressing issues and sustaining momentum.&#13;

Background&#13;
&#13;
The effort of â&#128;&#152;Nirmalâ&#128;&#153; GP, Jabda, is an inspiration for others on account of their hard work&#13;
and persistence in achieving results in sanitation. The focus on ensuring an effective process to&#13;
improve the performance and impact on results has won tremendous respect for Jabda, especially&#13;
for ensuring sanitation facilities for all households, schools and anganwadis, and for achieving&#13;
open defecation free status.&#13;
&#13;
Elements of Success&#13;
&#13;
The key elements of success have been:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Focus on demand creation for sanitation with the help of innovative approaches, especially&#13;
   the use of CLTS supported by information, education and communication tools, which&#13;
   have galvanised the community and ensured participation. The demand focussed training&#13;
   of motivators at the block and district levels have also helped in scaling up the process and&#13;
   producing results.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Institutionalisation of behaviour change programmes through the Village Water and Sanitation&#13;
   Committee in terms of implementation and monitoring; and regulatory mechanisms such as&#13;
   penalising open defecation, have also worked in supporting the sanitation drive.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Scaling of NGP has also helped in motivating the panchayat leadership to promote sanitation.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Monitoring by children within the village and external monitoring by block and district&#13;
   officials have strengthened the process of implementation and ensured its sustainability since&#13;
   2004. This has helped the panchayat to apply for the state-level Ujjawal Award, which is given&#13;
   for ensuring sustainability of NGP outcomes.&#13;

Community Sanitary Complexes under&#13;
Total Sanitation Campaign&#13;
Location: Mizoram&#13;
&#13;
A Brief History&#13;
&#13;
A hilly state, Mizoram is situated in the Northeast corner of India. As per the 2001 Census,&#13;
Mizoram has a population of 8,91,058 with a literacy percentage of 88.94 per cent.&#13;
&#13;
The Mizos traditionally lived in small villages situated on high hillocks. Each village functioned&#13;
as an independent sovereign unit with its own chief and council members (locally called â&#128;&#152;Lal&#13;
Khawnbawlâ&#128;&#153;). Though the Mizos practised open defecation, they did not defecate near water&#13;
sources, maintaining a high sense of hygiene and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
The arrival of the Christian Missionaries was responsible for a gradual change in the way of&#13;
living. Through the British, the Mizos were introduced to the dry pit latrine system for disposal&#13;
of excreta. This was popular for many years and is still practised. The dry pit latrine system&#13;
was basically seen as a means of privacy and people were not aware of the need for using it for&#13;
prevention of transmission of various diseases.&#13;

&#13;
Implementation of TSC&#13;
&#13;
In Mizoram, the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) was introduced in 2002. Emphasis has been&#13;
laid on information, education and communication components to change the behaviour of the&#13;
targetted population, by creating awareness about health education. The programme is being&#13;
implemented with focus on community-led and people-centred initiatives. The Village Water&#13;
and Sanitation Committee (VWSC) plays an effective role in absorbing new ideas and concepts.&#13;
Through the TSC, the consciousness of the community is being transformed towards health and&#13;
hygiene practices. People choose from a menu of options for household toilets for satisfying their&#13;
felt needs. The generation of demand for sanitation facilities motivated the targetted audiences&#13;
and they are willing to pay their share in the project. Thus, the physical implementation of this&#13;
programme has made remarkable achievements in converting dry toilets into pour flush toilets,&#13;
and construction of septic tanks. The programme has made a highly positive impact, especially in&#13;
the rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
A community sanitary complex (CSC) is an important component of the TSC. It is meant for&#13;
public places, markets, etc, where large-scale congregation of people takes place. As per provisions&#13;
of the guidelines, the sharing pattern between the centre, state and beneficiary is 60:30:10,&#13;
respectively, for a total cost of Rs 2.00 lakh per CSC.&#13;
&#13;
Mizoram has implemented innovative ideas for the operation and maintenance of such&#13;
complexes, which is essential as gram panchayats (GPs) have to ultimately own the responsibility&#13;
for them, as CSCs are to be used by the community. The location of a CSC is decided after&#13;
taking into consideration where people congregate every day, that is, near shopping areas and&#13;
taxi stands, etc. The public land is donated by the village council free of cost in the interest of&#13;
cleanliness in the village.&#13;
&#13;
An innovative design has been evolved for the CSC: one side of the complex is extended on one&#13;
side, and this is converted into a shop, which could sell items of daily need, books, stationery or&#13;
eatables. The shop is given to a person in return for a commitment to operate and maintain the&#13;
CSC. The shop is rented generally for one year through local advertisements as per terms and&#13;
conditions set for the purpose. The shopkeeper also takes care of the electricity and water bills&#13;
of the CSC. In certain cases, where collection through usersâ&#128;&#153; fee has been large or the shop has&#13;
been running successfully, the shop-owner also contributes up to Rs 200 per month to the village&#13;
council â&#128;&#147; for further maintenance of the complex or a one-time expenditure for the evacuation of&#13;
the septic tank, as and when required.&#13;
&#13;
This has, therefore, resulted in the sustainability of the community sanitary complexes,&#13;
constructed with central assistance under the Total Sanitation Campaign. Community members,&#13;
too, are satisfied as they get clean sanitary facilities.&#13;
&#13;
This concept can certainly be replicated in the northeastern region for ensuring clean&#13;
surroundings in public places and market areas.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                39&#13;

Children are more receptive to new ideas and, if motivated, can more easily change their&#13;
behaviour. School children can spread important health messages and practices from school to&#13;
home and are potential agents to carry these forward to the next generation.&#13;

The power of â&#128;&#152;childâ&#128;&#153; as motivator who influences purchasing behaviour within a middle class&#13;
family has been recognised by consumer industries. The same reasoning is applied in promoting&#13;
hygiene in the community. Experience shows that children can act as potential agents of change&#13;
within their homes and communities through their knowledge and use of sanitation and hygiene&#13;
practices learned at school.&#13;
&#13;
The well-managed, dirt-free surroundings of the school with a lot of plants and greenery,&#13;
cleanliness in all classrooms and toilets, has turned out to be an identity for rural schools in Uttar&#13;
Pradesh. This has been achieved through introduction of Child Cabinets. Once formed and&#13;
strengthened, the children have taken up the management of hygiene and sanitation in their own&#13;
hands. The transformation in the schools is happening with the active role of the Child Cabinet&#13;
and the support of the teachers.&#13;
&#13;
Rahul Patel, studying in Class 7, is small, but with a lot of self belief in what he does. He is the&#13;
Prime Minister of the Child Cabinet of Upper Primary School, Niyamtpur Khurd, Narayanpur,&#13;
Mirzapur district. He is very proud of the position he commands. He is first to arrive in the&#13;
morning, almost 15 minutes before the school starts, and gathers all the children of his Cabinet&#13;
to start the day by quickly checking the register to make sure that all are ready for their duties.&#13;
For them the school begins with a cleanliness drive including cleaning of toilets. They also put&#13;
all the flower pots in a systematic manner around the walkways. The Minister in charge of water&#13;
gathers his team of students to make sure that the overhead tanks are filled with water so that&#13;
they have running water in the toilets and for handwashing during school days. The Cultural&#13;
Minister is also present with the team to conduct morning assembly. After the prayer, once&#13;
again, Rahul, along with other ministers, is busy checking the nails and dress of the students. He&#13;
very proudly narrates that it is not only in schools, but also at home he ensures that every one&#13;
follows good hygiene practices â&#128;&#147; he helped his grandparents to overcome initial difficulties in&#13;
using a sanitary latrine. His grandparents were not very comfortable with the newly constructed&#13;
toilet at home and were not sure of how to use it. He demonstrated the correct way of using the&#13;
pour flush latrine. After this demonstration now the grandparents use it regularly and also tell&#13;
everyone, especially the old people, the benefits of using it.&#13;
&#13;
The participation of children in school sanitation and hygiene programmes is widely recognised&#13;
right from the selection of sites for installation/construction of water, sanitation and hygiene&#13;
(WASH) facilities, their use and maintenance, change within self and help to change other&#13;
children/peer groups, and largely in dissemination of knowledge /information about hygiene&#13;
and sanitation from school to the family and in the community. In addition to dissemination of&#13;
health and hygiene messages they also insist on a change in attitude and practices at the personal,&#13;
family and community level in health, hygiene and sanitation behaviour.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It has been widely accepted that when students play an active role in the operation and&#13;
maintenance of school infrastructure, they not only learn more by doing things themselves but&#13;
also gradually adopt the desired behavioural habits of using the facilities provided in the schools.&#13;
Also, lack of coordinated efforts to institutionalised arrangements for operation and maintenance&#13;
(O&amp;M) by students may lead to these facilities not being maintained and sustained for the&#13;
longer term. One of the major issues in ensuring provision of WASH facilities in schools is to&#13;
make them functional throughout the year. Many newly constructed facilities become unusable&#13;
after some time due to the lack of a proper O&amp;M system in place. This was a major concern in&#13;
schools in Uttar Pradesh till a few months ago. But now, school programmes for WASH have&#13;
organised special childrenâ&#128;&#153;s groups, under Child Cabinet.&#13;
&#13;
An aim of the Cabinet is to involve children as advocates for hygiene and sanitation practices&#13;
in the school and the community. Children can be powerful advocates for change among&#13;
their peers, family members and the wider community. They can take part in public awareness&#13;
campaigns, motivation in the home, teaching and helping younger brothers and sisters.&#13;
&#13;
Another purpose of the Cabinet, particularly the health minister, is to help ensure that water&#13;
and sanitation facilities in the school are used, cleaned and maintained as intended. The children&#13;
of the Child Cabinet explain how to use these facilities to the younger children. They help to&#13;
organise the children, for example, by leading the group that may need to carry water to the&#13;
school or by lining up and organising children to wash hands before eating. The members of&#13;
the clubs clean or work with groups of children to keep the schoolyard clean and to clean water&#13;
points and toilets. This is particularly helpful because many schools cannot afford to pay to clean&#13;
the facilities each day.&#13;
&#13;
The Child Cabinet offers many opportunities for children and teachers. They can allow teachers&#13;
to experiment outside the constraints of a classroom and its fixed curriculum. For example, in the&#13;
context of out-of-school activities it is easier to undertake community walks, observation, small&#13;
experiments, discussion groups as well as to develop songs or dances with the children on health&#13;
and hygiene themes. The introduction of Child Cabinets in schools has a positive impact on the&#13;
school environment; these schools demonstrate encouraging trends towards O&amp;M of physical&#13;
facilities as well as monitoring of hygiene behaviour by children itself.&#13;
&#13;
Apart from monitoring the use of sanitation facilities and hygiene practices, the Child Cabinet&#13;
is also helping teachers in conducting school activities in a systematic manner. Take the case&#13;
of Primary School Maheba Paschim Patti, Chaka, Allahabad. Shivam Kumar, the Education&#13;
Minister of the Child Cabinet, regularly helps the students of Class I with poetry lessons. He uses&#13;
the supplementary reading material developed with support from UNICEF to make the smaller&#13;
children learn handwashing. Similarly in Primary School Wari, Gyanpur, Bhadohi, children are&#13;
helping the teachers in maintaining plantation in the school. Each student in the Child Cabinet&#13;
has been allotted a plant to look after. The monitor of the school, Ajay Kumar Yadav, a student of&#13;
Class 5, proudly takes every visitor to show the rose plant he is in charge of which, incidentally, is&#13;
blooming with flowers.&#13;
&#13;
These are some examples which suggest that, provided a platform for participation, children can&#13;
manage school activities very well and help teachers in enhancing the quality of education.&#13;

Raising Clean Hands: An Innovative&#13;
Initiative for Handwashing in Schools&#13;
Location: Uttar Pradesh&#13;
&#13;
As Khushboo Patel, 12, rolls up her sleeves to prepare for a handwashing demonstration, other&#13;
schoolchildren quickly surround her. â&#128;&#156;It is important to keep our hands clean,â&#128;? she explains,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;especially after using the toilet, before and after each meal, and after playing outside.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Khushboo began teaching other students about good hygiene at Primary School Kachnar in&#13;
Arajiline block, Varanasi, after the first Global Handwashing Day in 2008. Two years later,&#13;
she continues to round up children in the playground at meal and break times. She also&#13;
encourages her schoolmates to pass on these healthy handwashing techniques to relatives&#13;
and friends at home. She is also the elected Prime Minister of the Child Cabinet of&#13;
the school.&#13;
&#13;
Students and teachers at the WASH-friendly Primary School, located in Bardaha gram panchayat&#13;
(GP) of Bhadohi block in Sant Ravidas Nagar (Bhadohi), are eager to show visitors the changes&#13;
theyâ&#128;&#153;ve made since learning about the importance of good water, sanitation, and hygiene&#13;
practices, better known as WASH. One change is the new handwashing stations â&#128;&#147; taps and soap&#13;
are set up around the school premises and used regularly. Students are taught the importance of&#13;
washing their hands at appropriate times â&#128;&#147; especially before eating and after using the toilet â&#128;&#147; and&#13;
are taking to this practice enthusiastically.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;The students really enjoy washing their hands and keeping clean,â&#128;? remarks Rajesh Kumar Singh,&#13;
the school Headmaster.&#13;
&#13;
These types of facilities are now becoming an integral part of school toilet design across schools&#13;
in Uttar Pradesh. In most of the schools visited, they have developed a system whereby, at the&#13;
beginning of each week and in many schools every day during prayers, teachers review with all&#13;
the students the three practices that improve child health and make a school WASH-friendly:&#13;
using the schoolâ&#128;&#153;s washable latrine; drinking water that has been purified; and washing hands&#13;
properly with soap. The children gladly recite these three principles to visitors, while their&#13;
teachers explain how these practices are improving attendance.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Before we had WASH instruction, students were often sick with diarrhoea,â&#128;? says Mr Ram Prasad&#13;
Shukla, Incharge Headmaster at the Upper Primary School, Nevada Samogar, Allahabad. â&#128;&#156;Now&#13;
the students arenâ&#128;&#153;t sick as much and can study regularly.â&#128;? Other teachers agree that absences from&#13;
school have decreased since the students started washing their hands with soap and drinking clean&#13;
water regularly.&#13;
&#13;
Water, sanitation and hygiene education in schools â&#128;&#147; a strategic approach known as WASH in&#13;
Schools â&#128;&#147; provides safe drinking water, improved sanitation facilities and hygiene education,&#13;
encouraging the development of healthy behaviour for life. WASH in Schools helps fulfill&#13;
childrenâ&#128;&#153;s right to health, education and participation, and enjoys widespread recognition for its&#13;
significant role in achieving the Millennium Development Goals â&#128;&#147; particularly those related to&#13;

universal access to primary education, reducing child mortality, improving water and sanitation,&#13;
and promoting gender equality.&#13;
&#13;
Each year, diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections are responsible for the deaths of&#13;
more than 3.5 million children under the age of five. Unsafe water and inadequate sanitation&#13;
are often major causes of lost work and missed school days, perpetuating the cycle of economic&#13;
and social stagnation in many countries. Investments in health, child survival, education, water&#13;
supply and sanitation are all jeopardised if there is a lack of emphasis on handwashing with soap.&#13;
&#13;
Washing hands with soap and water, especially at the critical times â&#128;&#147; after using the toilet and&#13;
before handling food â&#128;&#147; helps reduce the incidence of diarrhoeal disease by more than 40 per cent&#13;
and respiratory infections by nearly 25 per cent. Furthermore, washing hands with soap is also&#13;
being recommended as a critical action to prevent the spread of influenza H1N1.&#13;
&#13;
Handwashing with soap represents a cornerstone of public health and can be considered an&#13;
affordable, accessible â&#128;&#152;do-it-yourself â&#128;&#153; vaccine. It is economical, safe and effective. Improved&#13;
sanitation and hygiene programmes combined with handwashing education directly impact the&#13;
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 2: Universal primary education; and MDG 3: Gender&#13;
equality via higher enrolment, attendance and retention rates in schools for both girls and boys.&#13;
Additionally, higher rates of handwashing with soap would significantly contribute towards&#13;
meeting the MDG 4 of reducing deaths of children under the age of five by two-thirds by 2015.&#13;
&#13;
Despite its life-saving potential, handwashing with soap is seldom practiced and not always easy&#13;
to promote. Although soap is available in most households around the world, observed rates of&#13;
handwashing with soap at critical moments range from zero to 34 per cent. For successful and&#13;
sustained behavioral change to occur, it is vital to incorporate community-based and community-&#13;
sensitive approaches that understand what motivates people to change. Handwashing is the most&#13;
critical target behaviour in the school interventions.&#13;
&#13;
In most of the schools, it is often the drinking water source or the only handpump, also doubles&#13;
up as designated place for washing hands. This is one thing very uncomfortable for the children.&#13;
Keeping soap at the handpump was not practically economical for the school also. Monitoring&#13;
the habit of handwashing was also difficult for the teachers. It was also putting lot of undue&#13;
pressure on the water source, often resulting in a lot of wastewater and children piling on each&#13;
other to do it first. The resources available with the schools are limited and making proper&#13;
handwashing provisions within this resource is difficult. Schools in Uttar Pradesh, across various&#13;
districts, present a fine example of convergence and utilising available resources under other&#13;
schemes to develop designated places for handwashing in schools. Most commonly, funds from&#13;
the 12th Finance Commission and State Finance Commission has been dovetailed to ensure&#13;
these important provisions in the schools. This is one practice that will go long way in developing&#13;
a better school environment.&#13;

Dining Sheds: Hygiene, Equality and Dignity to&#13;
Mid-day Meal&#13;
Location: Uttar Pradesh&#13;
One of the important policy decisions of the Government            of the village as a whole. Irrespective of caste and class, all&#13;
of India, few years ago, was to provide nutritious meal in         children share the same space. In a way, these dining sheds&#13;
government-run schools for all children. There were various        are proving to be a social leveler.&#13;
reasons given in favour of this scheme and lot of funds&#13;
allocated for the purpose every year. Infrastructurally, schools   Mr Wakeel Ahmed, headman (pradhan) of Soraon village,&#13;
were also provided funds for making kitchen sheds and for          Allahabad, and Mr Kandarp Narayan Mishra, Headmaster&#13;
storing food within the school premises. But something             of the primary school, instead of playing patronage with&#13;
that was missing were provisions regarding how the food            public resources, used the State Finance Commission grant&#13;
is distributed to, and eaten by, the students. If you visit        for the construction of a dining shed in the premises of the&#13;
most schools during the lunch hour, you will find children         village primary school. It cost the panchayat approximately&#13;
jostling for space to eat food comfortably, sitting in corners,    Rs 1,10,000 to construct this facility where around 150â&#128;&#147;200&#13;
etc. In the process, smaller children are the worst hit. Lack      children can eat together. The headmaster narrates that&#13;
of a proper space for eating also means that after the lunch       during construction, the children were surprised to see&#13;
hour, the whole school is dirty with food waste all over the       something this big coming up right in the middle of their&#13;
premises. There are stories of social barriers being reportedly    school. On the day of the inauguration, not a single student&#13;
practiced in the school â&#128;&#147; higher caste children refusing to eat    missed the food in the dining hall â&#128;&#147; even though earlier&#13;
food along with lower caste children; or children refusing         some children were going home to eat food during lunch&#13;
food because it had been cooked by someone considered              hour! For them, he explained, this was something which&#13;
lower in the social set up.                                        made them and their school â&#128;&#156;superiorâ&#128;? to all other schools in&#13;
                                                                   the neighbourhood. These sheds are making children learn&#13;
Apart from these issues, one bigger issue was the kind of          about discipline, coming in queues, eating food in a hygienic&#13;
respect and dignity that was being provided to the children        manner. They also provide an opportunity to teachers and&#13;
at meal time. The prevailing unhygienic conditions and             community members to monitor food distribution.&#13;
manner in which the food is prepared and served was also&#13;
a cause of concern. Looking at this scheme from a different        Similar initiatives can be seen in other primary schools: PS&#13;
perspective, it provides great opportunity to monitor a key        Sikara Kalan in Mirzapur, Upper Primary School Sukrit&#13;
hygiene behaviour â&#128;&#147; handwashing with soap before handling          in Sonbhadra, Primary School Ubhari, Primary School&#13;
food, amongst the children. It was very difficult for the          Maheba Paschim Patti, Primary School Dera Gadai in&#13;
teachers to monitor hygiene behaviour associated with food.        Allahabad, Primary School Sarai Kalidas in Jaunpur, Upper&#13;
It was important that all children wash their hands with soap      Primary School Mandwari, and Upper Primary School&#13;
before eating.                                                     Gangaura in Lalitpur.&#13;
&#13;
To address this issue of hygiene during the mid-day meal           The dining shed has not only broadened the scope of the&#13;
scheme, the school authorities and the Panchayati Raj              Total Sanitation Campaign, it has also given ownership&#13;
Institutions (PRIs) were motivated to come up with a               and legitimacy to the mid-day meal scheme, in addition to&#13;
solution where not only social concerns but behaviour              enriching the School Sanitation and Hygiene Education&#13;
concerns could be properly addressed. The result is that           (SSHE) programme. What is particularly striking about&#13;
several schools, across the state, have come up with different     the Nuan Soraon village panchayat, including others roped&#13;
kinds of dining sheds in the schools. These sheds provide a        in under the SSHE programme, is that the state resources&#13;
place to eat food properly. Through this initiative, schools       have generously been utilised for upgrading environmental&#13;
have their first experiential learning of inclusion. Children      sanitation and personal hygiene at school. The quest for&#13;

of a collective, a joint community. Thus, these dining sheds       has constantly been getting momentum under the SSHE&#13;

&#13;
A surfeit of studies and reports on Panchayati Raj Institution (PRIs) suggest that the new&#13;
decentralised system of governance has given an opportunity to the people to exercise control&#13;
on the quality of local public services and related matters in a number of states. There are, in&#13;
fact, interesting cases where an improved practice of local democracy is considered to have led to&#13;
have some progress in the quality of development programmes. The situation in Uttar Pradesh,&#13;
however, is generally characterised by factional strife, often little more than social and economic&#13;
competition which is enhanced by securing access to state resources. Thus, development&#13;
programmes, in particular, are often regarded by faction leaders as useful channels for reward&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In marked contrast to this trend, the headman (pradhan) of Nuan village in Mirzapur district&#13;
of the state, instead of playing patronage with public resources, went out to use the State&#13;
Finance Commission grant for the construction of a dining shed in the premises of a village&#13;
primary school.&#13;
&#13;
The dining shed has not only broadened the scope of the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC), it&#13;
has also given ownership and legitimacy to the mid-day meal (MDM), in addition to enriching&#13;
the UNICEF supported School Sanitation and Hygiene Education (SSHE) programme.&#13;
&#13;
What is particularly striking about the Nuan village panchayat, including others roped in under&#13;
the SSHE programme, is that the state resources have generously been utilised for upgrading&#13;
environmental sanitation and personal hygiene at school, sometimes at the village-level, as&#13;
evidenced by the sight of public urinals, working rural drainage, safe waste disposal systems, etc.&#13;
This has set an example before panchayats across the state. The school premises in SSHE villages,&#13;
including Nuan, are of course, equipped with designer and child-friendly water and sanitation&#13;
facilities such as toilets, hand wash, brick soling, etc. In Nuan, one can even see functional&#13;
bins, spittoons and guest toilets. The idea has been to make available the school facilities to the&#13;
community at nominal rates. It is, thus, also that a system of taxation has been placed for the&#13;
community using school facilities. And the revenue generated is chanellised for â&#128;&#152;greeningâ&#128;&#153; the&#13;
campus and maintaining the facilities.&#13;
&#13;
Catalysing Action and Innovation&#13;
&#13;
In the context of a situation where the PRI could not provide any basis for local democracy&#13;
and accountability, where privileged groups continue to exercise control on almost everything,&#13;
where appropriation of public resources and dispensation of patronage has been playing an&#13;
important role, there was virtually nothing, no scope for grounding a the programme as&#13;
daunting as the SSHE.&#13;
&#13;
But the show had to go on! With a Divisional Sanitation Coordinator (DSC) at the helm of the&#13;
affairs, it all began with a workshop in December 2006.&#13;
&#13;
The workshop gave the pradhans and the programme participants probably a maiden&#13;
opportunity to prevail over the situation and see beyond the village confines.&#13;
&#13;
A number of village pradhans turned up to see the District Project Coordinator with the agenda&#13;
of individual household latrines (IHHL) construction. That created a cataclysm which facilitated&#13;
the grounding of the SSHE in primary and upper primary schools. By virtue of its design,&#13;
effective mobilisation strategies and, of course, the leadership provided by the DSC, Mirzapur&#13;
division, the programme took over the reigns of village panchayats.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                47&#13;
&amp;#12;From Dreams to Reality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
From here commenced the race for excelling and outsmarting each other among the pradhans,&#13;
in giving expression to their thrusts within the frame of reference of the SSHE programme.&#13;
The announcement of an International Learning Exchange (ILE) programme brought real&#13;
impetus; it was, in fact, motivated. The Divisional Coordinator maintained constant â&#128;&#152;vigilâ&#128;&#153; on&#13;
the progress. On the pretext of a forthcoming visit, for instance, the Coordinator and his team&#13;
together led the pradhan to the understanding of the need of developing a dining shed in the&#13;
school premises, and extended handholding support in designing and execution.&#13;
&#13;
Dining Shed in Nuan&#13;
&#13;
The quest for doing something innovative, something distinguishing has constantly been getting&#13;
momentum under the shadow of the ILE visit. The Nuan pradhan was particularly interested&#13;
about the whole thing.&#13;
&#13;
It was, thus, a series of discussions and consultations among the stakeholders, that finally resulted&#13;
in the coinage of the â&#128;&#152;ideaâ&#128;&#153; and its manifestation in the form of a dining shed. Funds totalling&#13;
nearly Rs 1,27,000 for the purpose were leveraged from the State Finance Commission grant by&#13;
the village panchayat. The shed was completed in October 2008.&#13;
&#13;
The 900 sq ft shed can seat 150 children. Its construction is concrete with tile dressing, and the&#13;
roof is made of fibre sheet.&#13;
&#13;
This dining shed in Nuan is no exception to the work being done. The water and sanitation&#13;
infrastructure developed under the SSHE programme in other villages (such as Niamatpur&#13;
Khurd, Lakhanpur, Khanjadipur, Arangi Sarpati, Tilaimanar etc) is also praiseworthy.&#13;
&#13;
Implications&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Socially, the mobilisation strategy which resulted in the development of WATSAN&#13;
   infrastructure in the village primary school through the involvement of the panchayat has&#13;
   proved itself as an effective tool of undermining factional strife and giving the PRI a new self-&#13;
   image, a sense of purpose â&#128;&#147; something like public accountability.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The dining shed has redefined the scope of the MDM. It has demonstrated its worth in&#13;
   maintaining the required sanitation standards. The effort is seen as empowering, as a source of&#13;
   pride and respectability.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Specialised handwashing facilities also supplement the sanitation requirements of the MDM,&#13;
   towards its accomplishment as a complete package.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The dining shed cannot be seen as complementary. There is growing awareness among stakeholders&#13;
   and experts that the shed should be made an inevitable fixture of the MDM scheme.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Now the MDM shed innovation â&#128;&#147; replicated in other blocks of Mirzapur district â&#128;&#147;is&#13;
   spreading in neighbouring districts such as Allahabad, Sonbhadra, Jaunpur and so on. Many&#13;
   other districts are interested in such an MDM shed.&#13;

Changing the Face of Rural Hygiene: Case Study of&#13;

West Garo Hills is one of the largest districts of          of the people. A review conducted by the DWSC in&#13;
Meghalaya, covering an area of about 3,714 sq km and        2009 revealed some weaknesses in the implementation&#13;

etc. The Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) was launched          prescribed.&#13;
in West Garo Hills in 2004 and is implemented through       â&#128;¢	 Focus on individuals rather than community â&#128;&#147; out of&#13;

Journey to Zero Open Defecation&#13;
Location: West Godavari District, Andhra Pradesh&#13;
&#13;
West Godavari is one of the main coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh, with 2,164 habitations in&#13;
the district. Most of the people in the district are poor, living below poverty line without basic&#13;
needs like sanitation facilities.&#13;
&#13;
The District Water Sanitation Mission (DWSM) was registered under the Societies Act, in 2003.&#13;
The chairman of the zilla parishad (ZP) is the chairman of the Mission. An executive committee&#13;
under the chairmanship of the district collector functions as the executive arm of the Mission.&#13;
In the initial stages of the implementation of TSC, the focus was on the hardware component&#13;
of sanitation. However, the thinking process changed after the then sarpanch of Juvvalapalem&#13;
village of Kalla Mandal received the first â&#128;&#152;Nirmal Gram Puraskarâ&#128;&#153; (NGP) award for a village in&#13;
2006. Inspired by this achievement, DWSM decided to make it big. The goal was to achieve first&#13;
position in the state.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
56&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                           Compendium of Best Practices in Rural Sanitation in India&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Governmental Organisationâ&#128;&#147;Non-governmental Organisation&#13;
Partnership&#13;
&#13;
The DWSM had mainly departmental staff, and though there are policy directions for&#13;
strengthening the DWSM with professionals, it was not practical for a small town like Eluru, the&#13;
district headquarters. To resolve this issue, initially a team of five district resource persons was&#13;
constituted to take the agenda forward. Even after a great deal of hard work, the Mission could&#13;
reach only 100 villages in the district. The agenda required a larger team. The small team of staff&#13;
within the DSWM was not adequate for realising the goal. The DWSM then decided to establish&#13;
an innovative institutional design based on partnership models.&#13;
&#13;
The DSWM benefited from the partnerships with Paschima Samakhya, a network of 100 local&#13;
non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This network is coordinated by an NGOâ&#128;&#147;Social&#13;
Service Centre. The DWSM overcame its initial apprehensions related to the role of and&#13;
partnership with NGOs through a series of meetings and discussions. It was important to orient&#13;
the chief functionaries of the NGOs on the needs and goals of the DWSM. After consistent&#13;
efforts, the partnership between NGOs and the DWSM started yielding good results.&#13;
&#13;
The district annual action plans for Information, Education and Communications (IEC) was&#13;
prepared to provide direction. This plan was approved by the District Collector in a single&#13;
approval and there was no need to take day-to-day approvals. The villages were categorised into&#13;
â&#128;&#152;focusâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;preparatoryâ&#128;&#153; villages. The IEC inputs and strategies were fine-tuned to the needs of&#13;
these two categories. Top priority has been given to convergence mode right from district level to&#13;
village level. Several workshops were organised. The participants have been involved in chalking&#13;
out the action plan for the year and preparation of calendar for events to follow throughout&#13;
the district. Group discussions have been encouraged; ideas expressed by all the participant are&#13;
collated in a pool.&#13;
&#13;
Community-Led Total Sanitation Campaign (CLTSC) â&#128;&#147; A Decisive Shift in&#13;
the Strategy and Approach&#13;
&#13;
The need and importance of training and capacity building inputs were well recognised in the&#13;
programme. The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) came forward to support the DWSM&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                 57&#13;
&amp;#12;From Dreams to Reality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
with capacity building support using various participatory tools. These inputs helped the team&#13;
to gain new levels of confidence and developed conviction among the team members about the&#13;
agenda and goal. Thirty-two resource persons participated in the training programme. Some of&#13;
them were District Literacy Mission and part time workers. Eight members from this pool were&#13;
placed at the Mandal level as district resource persons; this number was later increased to 34&#13;
and they were designated Nodal Coordinators and Mandal Coordinators for school sanitation&#13;
and hygiene education. This strategy helped in reaching out to large number of villages and&#13;
developing a Mandal-level pool of resource persons. The Mandal Coordinators identified village&#13;
sanitation motivators from each village and trained them on the processes and goals of CLTSC.&#13;
Now the district has 640 village sanitation motivators, covering all gram panchayats (GP) in the&#13;
district. The pools of district resource persons consist of a variety of persons â&#128;&#147; Accredited Social&#13;
Health Activist (ASHA) workers; GP secretaries; village youths; anganwadi teachers, etc. These&#13;
members work on the agenda of sanitation and support the Mission. The interesting point is that&#13;
these members work on voluntary basis and the Mission does not pay any fee to them.&#13;
&#13;
A visit to Haryana state was organised during September 2008 for ZPTC members, selected&#13;
MPPs and MPDOs with the partnership of the WSP. They learned the various strategies&#13;
adopted by the Total Sanitation Campaign in Haryana and were impressed by the method of&#13;
implementation of sanitation programmes in the villages.&#13;
&#13;
The First â&#128;&#152;First Positionâ&#128;&#153; in the State Set the Trend&#13;
&#13;
In 2007, 28 villages in the West Godavari district got the NGP and, for the first time, the district&#13;
stood in the first place in the state in terms of the number of NGPs. This gave tremendous&#13;
confidence to the district teams. During this period, the Government of Andhra Pradesh also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
58&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                            Compendium of Best Practices in Rural Sanitation in India&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
introduced â&#128;&#152;Shubram Awardsâ&#128;&#153; for clean villages. During the awards function, the Chief Minister&#13;
challenged the ZP chairman not to be satisfied with 28 awards and motivated him to get 200 awards&#13;
next year. This challenge triggered a serious attention to the agenda of total sanitation in the district.&#13;
Successive district collectors further supported and improved the strategies and support systems. The&#13;
district administration is now pursuing a convergence mode of all departments and implementing&#13;
total sanitation with community participation to achieve zero open defecation status to the district.&#13;
The vision is broadened and common vision is established. The entire administration is involved&#13;
in the agenda. The ZP actively involves all the officials and elected representatives in the sanitation&#13;
programme. Mandal Praja Parishads and their staff, GP and various departments became an integral&#13;
part of this agenda. Since the political support is visible, media attention also happened, and the&#13;
total sanitation agenda got visibility. During 2008, West Godavari District received 195 NGPs and&#13;
again stood first in the state. In 2009, the district again stood first in the state with 86 NGPs. Out of&#13;
the 888 GPs, 472 GPs have either previously won or applied for NGP in this year. This is the highest&#13;
among the districts of the state. The goal has now become bigger and the DWSM is determined to&#13;
make the entire district open defecation free (ODF).&#13;
&#13;
Ten Commandments Fixed by the District Administration&#13;
&#13;
The DWSM has set 10 Commandments to follow in the villages to achieve open defecation&#13;
free status:&#13;
&#13;
1.	 Access to individual sanitary latrines for all.&#13;
2.	 No open defecation.&#13;
3.	 All schools with toilet facilities.&#13;

Best Practices in Rural Sanitation&#13;
Location: Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka&#13;
&#13;
The Dakshina Kannada zilla panchayat (DKZP) has been working to encourage and promote&#13;
innovations and inventions in the effective implementation of the Total Sanitation Campaign&#13;
(TSC) components in the district. Several activities, such as mass construction of toilets,&#13;
involvement of rural youth and people representatives, anganwadi workers, health workers,&#13;
self-help groups (SHGs), officials, school teachers and children have become unique models in&#13;
themselves.&#13;
&#13;
In Dakshina Kannada district, the TSC was launched on October 2, 2005, by the district&#13;
minister along with elected representatives of the gram panchayat (GP) and district officials.&#13;
Implementation of the TSC requires large scale social mobilisation. GPs, under the guidance&#13;
of the district authority, played a pivotal role in the success of the TSC in the district. The GPs&#13;
carried out the social mobilisation for the construction of toilets and maintenance of a clean&#13;
environment by way of safe disposal of waste. Panchayats and non-governmental organisations&#13;
(NGOs) made the implementation of the campaign a priority.&#13;
&#13;
Achievements&#13;
&#13;
The efforts and involvement of rural Dakshina Kannadigans was rewarded by the Nirmal Gram&#13;
Puraskar (NGP) award: 49 GPs in 2007, 131 GPs in 2008 and 23 GPs in 2009 have received&#13;
NGP awards, besides receiving three block-level NGP awards. Dakshina Kannada district, was&#13;
the first and the only district to represent the state at the block-level NPG award.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#152;Shramadhanâ&#128;&#153; Mode and Media Support&#13;
&#13;
Eradicating open defecation and sensitising the rural population on healthy living habits are&#13;
the main objective of the TSC. Ira GP, in Bantwal taluk of Dakshina Kannada district, has&#13;
successfully worked out a model for achieving these objectives. The campaign was kicked off&#13;
in Ira GP on October 2, 2005; Mr Chandrashekar Pathur, the secretary of the GP, called the&#13;

secretaries of Bantwal taluk for â&#128;&#152;shramadhanâ&#128;&#153;.1 On November 11, 2005 about 26 self-motivated&#13;
GP secretaries conducted â&#128;&#152;shramadhanâ&#128;&#153; in Mundadi Aadivasi Colony â&#128;&#147; they dug pits for&#13;
two houses that were in the hard laterite land area. After this gesture gained media visibility,&#13;
many officials and peopleâ&#128;&#153;s representatives elsewhere in the district were motivated to perform&#13;
â&#128;&#152;shramadhanâ&#128;&#153;. In Golthamajal GP, 110 toilets were built in one day! As the manual labour&#13;
was going on, the people of Scheduled Caste colonies and backward areas were explained the&#13;
importance of toilet use, maintenance, usage of soap and handwashing.&#13;
&#13;
More than 25 â&#128;&#152;shramadhanâ&#128;&#153; camps were successfully conducted by the GP. Soon, local&#13;
community-based organisations joined hands in the initiative.&#13;
&#13;
Supply of Materials&#13;
&#13;
Zilla panchayat (ZP) member A.C. Bhandary took the responsibility of supply of material such&#13;
as slanted and baby pans that were not available locally. Donors were identified and motivated to&#13;
supply sanitation materials to needy villagers.&#13;
&#13;
Information, Education and Communication (IEC) Campaigns&#13;
&#13;
Children are given education on sanitation and personal hygiene continuously. Teachers were&#13;
trained by ZP members. School Betterment Committee members ensure the cleanliness of&#13;
the toilets.&#13;
&#13;
Elocution, essay writing, debate, slogan writing and other competitions on the topic of TSC&#13;
have been held for students of all levels. Nursery rhymes and dances on TSC, for instance, were&#13;
exhibited by anganwadi kids. Pamphlets on TSC were distributed with the help of self-help&#13;
groups. Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s active involvement in the sanitation programme was boosted by conducting&#13;
ward-wise competitions. Yuvaka/Yuvathi Mandals, Sthree Shakthi, other self-help groups and&#13;
National Social Service units of various colleges and elected members of the panchayats helped in&#13;
spreading information about the campaign. School children, for example, visited nearby houses&#13;
regularly with the aim of spreading awareness about good sanitary habits.&#13;
&#13;
Educational Visits&#13;
&#13;
Teams of peopleâ&#128;&#153;s representatives, NGOs, officials and development agencies from different&#13;
districts, states, and also from different countries have visited the GP to study the Ira model of&#13;
total sanitation. This has inspired the villages to maintain the success they have achieved.&#13;
&#13;
Many other people were involved in the campaign. The NGO Janashikshana Trust has provided&#13;
pivotal support to the campaign. The SKDRDP conducted the best SHG competitions (Nirmal&#13;
Okkuta Award) to boost the movement. Nagarika Seva trust, Guruvayanakere, conducted&#13;
a mass IEC campaign. The women of the district, especially, made the movement a top&#13;
priority irrespective of all the social hurdles. A strong communal fraternity emerged as the task&#13;
progressed. This large-scale mass movement was strengthened with large-scale material donations.&#13;
The district minister, Members of Legislative Assembly, Members of Parliament, and panchayat&#13;
members pitched in with help.&#13;

â&#128;&#152;Swachatha Neethiâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
&#13;
A sanitation policy, that is, a â&#128;&#152;swachatha neethiâ&#128;&#153;, which was worked out and approved by GP&#13;
members and secretary, was circulated to every household. It became a model for all GPs in the&#13;
district. Officials volunteered their time to help spread the message. Mr Dharanendra Kumar,&#13;
a former vice president of the ZP, for instance, worked in eight GPs in his constituency â&#128;&#147; he&#13;
conducted a door-to-door campaign, and motivated people to construct individual toilets, and&#13;
also grow gardens. Due to such efforts, Hosangady gained popularity and landmarks&#13;
in sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Questionnaires were prepared to get the feedback of the target groups. District- and taluk-level&#13;
officials, and district support unit officials, made spot visits to the target GPs and places where&#13;
work was being done.&#13;
&#13;
Third party inspections have been conducted in almost every panchayat. NGOs from different&#13;
parts of the state were involved in the process. The president and other elected authorities of&#13;
the panchayat, government and school officials, and field workers attend a taluk-level meeting&#13;
every month. Personal overviews by the CEO and the DKZP boost the morale of employees and&#13;
volunteers. Ward-wise committees maintain follow-up programmes, visiting the houses under the&#13;
TSC frequently. Ward â&#128;&#152;swachathaâ&#128;&#153; committees have been strengthened for the sustainability of&#13;
the programme. The end of open defecation has been made a reality.&#13;
&#13;
Plastic-free Ira and Hosangady Gram Panchayats&#13;
&#13;
The ZP administration has also embarked on a drive for the proper disposal of solid waste,&#13;
especially, the effective management of plastic waste. Sensitising people about the menace of&#13;
plastic in the environment was a challenge in the Ira GP of Bantwal taluk and Hosangady GP&#13;
in Belthangady taluk. To make plastic-free villages a reality, several interactions with various&#13;
stakeholders were held. Community members led from the front to make their village plastic&#13;
free. It was decided to undertake the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
Mass awareness about the evils of plastic usage. In orientation programmes â&#128;&#147; organised by the&#13;
GPs for self-help group members, peopleâ&#128;&#153;s representatives, local youth, teachers, health workers,&#13;
NGOs and GP members â&#128;&#147; resource persons spoke on the negative impacts of plastics on Nature&#13;
and on the health of the people, and stressed the urgent need for its proper management. Several&#13;
rallies were organised, inspiring slogans were written at key places, and door-to-door campaigns&#13;
were held.&#13;
&#13;
Creation of a â&#128;&#152;plastic hillâ&#128;&#153;. The mass awareness programme resulted in a huge collection of&#13;
various types of plastics from households. These were cleaned, dried and deposited in schools&#13;
and anganwadi centres. From here the plastics were collected on the 15th of every month and&#13;
stored in a â&#128;&#152;plastic hillsâ&#128;&#153; on the outskirts of the villages. A plastic waste collector from Mangalore&#13;
city was identified to collect the plastic waste (at Rs 1 per kg). This collected plastic was then&#13;
transported to Dharwad for recycling.&#13;
&#13;
Promotion of cloth bags. Having found the way for recycling of plastic waste, the next&#13;
challenge was the promotion of cloth bags in the rural set up. Local NGOs and SHGs were&#13;
trained on how to stitch cloth bags and were motivated to produce the bags at minimum cost.&#13;
With the supply of cloth by the GPs, the SHG members and other women came forward to&#13;
supply cloth bags free of cost. These cloth bags were supplied to households and shops.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Supply of dustbins. Red- and green-coloured dustbins were supplied by the GPs to everyone in&#13;
the shopping area of the village for segregating organic and inorganic wastes.&#13;
&#13;
All these efforts resulted in making Ira and Hosangady GPs plastic-free zones. Several visitors&#13;
from various countries, for example, Nigeria, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, have&#13;
applauded these initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
This year, the DKZP has taken on the implementation of simple, scientific and economically&#13;
viable technologies in all the GPs of the district. Workshops have been conducted at the GP and&#13;
taluk panchayat levels. The effort is to put the NGP award amount to proper use.&#13;
&#13;
The ZP administration has also taken up water source sustainability, testing of sources,&#13;
chlorination, and metering in the mission mode even as far as rural drinking water supply in the&#13;
west coast, Dakshina Kannada, district of Karnataka.&#13;

Total Sanitation Campaign on Mission Mode&#13;
Location: Shimoga District, Karnataka&#13;
&#13;
Shimoga, a Karnataka district, has achieved total sanitation within a short span of time with a mission mode through&#13;
excellent interdepartmental coordination. Though the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) was sanctioned earlier, the&#13;
programme was formally launched on October 2, 2005, in the district as part of the state-wide launch. By 2009 end,&#13;
230 gram panchayats (GP) out of 260 had achieved total sanitation and received the Nirmal Gram Puraskar (NGP)&#13;
from the Government of India. The remaining 30 GPs have applied for NGP in 2010. This is a good practice in rural&#13;
sanitation in the state as well as in the country.&#13;
&#13;
The strategy adopted by the district was totally demand-driven, community-led and people-centred. A major factor&#13;
in the success was the active participation of, and a big push from, the officials and elected representatives at all levels&#13;
under the leadership of the Chief Executive Officer, zilla panchayat (ZP). In addition to human excreta disposal,&#13;
management of liquid and solid waste, as well as personal and community hygiene were also addressed under the&#13;
programme.&#13;
&#13;
Approach and Strategy&#13;
&#13;
The strategy was built on the principles of the TSC guidelines, with a focus on involving Panchayati Raj Institutions&#13;
and the community at all stages.&#13;
&#13;
Goal&#13;
&#13;
The target was to achieve an open defecation free (ODF) district covering 260 GPs. The aim was two-fold: ensure the&#13;
construction of 40,151 household toilets for â&#128;&#152;above poverty lineâ&#128;&#153; households and 99,428 toilets for â&#128;&#152;below poverty lineâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
households, 951 school toilets and 960 anganwadi toilets; and to ensure that all infrastructure was used 100 per cent.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key Elements of the Strategy&#13;
&#13;
Some key elements of the strategy are:&#13;
&#13;
Phasing: Initially the district worked with selected 25 GPs where GP leadership was very strong and focused on&#13;
achieving ODF status. Twenty-three out of these achieved total sanitation and received NGP in the first year&#13;
(2006â&#128;&#147;07). With this, the district administration and field-level staff also gained confidence&#13;
&#13;
Demonstration effect: All the 23 GPs that received NGP in the first year were showcased in the district to motivate&#13;
other GPs. The GP secretaries and the president of the NGP GPs were enlisted as resource persons to work in the&#13;
neighboring GPs for motivation and guidance.&#13;
&#13;
Involvement of More Stakeholders&#13;
&#13;
One of the most important steps taken by the district administration was to involve other line departments such as&#13;
Health, Education, Child and Mother Welfare and Social Welfare in addition to non-governmental organisations&#13;
(NGOs), self help groups, anganwadi workers, children, parents, teachers and headmasters of the local schools, with&#13;
the support of the School Development Management Committees.&#13;
&#13;
Role of the Media&#13;
&#13;
The press and media played an important role in affecting a psychological change in the mindset of the rural people&#13;
with regard to the implementation of the TSC. Many media exposure visits were organised to the successful villages&#13;
and GPs to disseminate success stories in the electronic and print media.&#13;
&#13;
Involvement of Religious and Informal Leaders&#13;
&#13;
Religious and informal leaders played an important role in spreading the message of the importance of sanitation&#13;
through visits to villages and â&#128;&#152;Meet the Mediaâ&#128;&#153; programmes.&#13;
&#13;
Supply Chain Management&#13;
&#13;
Sanitary materialsâ&#128;&#153; productions and sanitary marts were established locally based on requirement. Financial&#13;
institutions, such as lead banks, were roped into the programme to extend financial assistance or loans through&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                               65&#13;
&amp;#12;From Dreams to Reality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
self help groups. The Rotary Organisation also joined hands in the implementation of the TSC in the district.&#13;
They provided â&#128;&#152;Baby Pansâ&#128;&#153; to all anganwadi centres in the district. Many leaders contributed in kind, for instance,&#13;
providing tractors or labour to procure local materials for the construction of toilets. The GPs were authorised to&#13;
purchase the bricks, pans and other materials at competitive rates fixed by the district-level committee.&#13;
&#13;
Recognition&#13;
&#13;
The GPâ&#128;&#153;s secretaries, presidents or any other individual who made a substantial contribution for sanitation promotion&#13;
were felicitated in public functions, which triggered government officials at the field level to play a proactive role in&#13;
the TSC.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
Various approaches were adopted to monitor the success of the programme, for example, organising media visits to&#13;
villages, creating monitoring committees at the village level, involving school children in tacking open defecation in&#13;
the villages, etc.&#13;
&#13;
Lessons Learnt&#13;
&#13;
Some of the interesting lessons learnt from the field are:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 In some places the lack of space did not prove to be a constraint to dig up the pits. Some families utilised their&#13;
   living spaces, inside the house, for this purpose. The issue of space constraint was proved to be psychological.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 When there were no funds available under the TSC, the GPs diverted local funds allocated for other works,&#13;
   to ensure the easy flow of money for the programme. This was reimbursed subsequently when the funds were&#13;
   released.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Some of the GP presidents contributed their honorarium/sitting fee to the TSC till the village become ODF,&#13;
   while some others undertook dharnas in front of the households reluctant to build a toilet.&#13;
&#13;
Health Impact&#13;
&#13;
The successful implementation of the TSC in the district seems to have made a remarkable positive impact on the&#13;
general health condition of the rural people. The incidence of many water-borne diseases has come down drastically.&#13;
While as many as 4,643 cases of water-borne diseases (such as cholera, gastroenteritis, jaundice, typhoid, amoebic&#13;
dysentery) were reported in 2005â&#128;&#147;06, this number gradually came down to 2,427 in 2007â&#128;&#147;08, 1,215 in 2008â&#128;&#147;09&#13;
and 595 in 2009â&#128;&#147;10 â&#128;&#147; according to the Health Report of the Primary Health Centres of all the 230 GPs. This&#13;
reduction is attributed to the positive impact of the TSC.&#13;

Community Led, Community Built,&#13;
Community Owned&#13;
Location: East Garo Hills District, Meghalaya&#13;
&#13;
The District Water and Sanitation Committee (DWSC) of East Garo Hills district was&#13;
constituted in 2007. As in many other parts of the country, different strategies were deployed&#13;
to implement the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) in letter and spirit. However, the biggest&#13;
weakness was that TSC implementation never assumed a â&#128;&#152;campaign modeâ&#128;&#153; â&#128;&#147;it was seen as one of&#13;
the many centrally sponsored programmes. Against this background, the Community-Led Total&#13;
Sanitation (CLTS) approach was incorporated into the implementation strategy from June 2009&#13;
and, within one year, there have been remarkable successes in the field â&#128;&#147; finally transforming&#13;
TSC into a truly community-led campaign.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                             67&#13;
&amp;#12;From Dreams to Reality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Approach and Strategy&#13;
&#13;
A typical village in the district has an average of 50 households. On the basis of toilet usage&#13;
practices, households can be classified into three broad categories â&#128;&#147; those who practice open&#13;
defecation (OD); those which have unsafe toilets (an opened-up pipe serving as a drop hole&#13;
which is directly connected to a pit without a water seal/P-trap); and those with safe toilets. The&#13;
CLTS approach looks at the village or community, and not an individual household, as a unit&#13;
of action. A group of well trained and motivated facilitators visit a village and, in the first visit,&#13;
try to understand the overall sanitation scenario. The village community is then triggered into&#13;
understanding the importance of sanitation by using innovative triggering tools which clearly&#13;
establish the link between health, water and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Once the community members understand this link, they take decisions to remedy the&#13;
situation. In many villages, OD stopped within a week after triggering and toilet construction&#13;
was taken up by the community. The facilitators step in at this stage to educate the community&#13;
on low-cost toilet construction strategies; form a Village Water and Sanitation Committee&#13;
(VWSC) comprising natural leaders; conduct mason training; and assist in purchase of&#13;
materials through the Rural Sanitary Marts (RSM). Then the community collects locally&#13;
available materials, purchases other materials from the RSM, and starts construction in a&#13;
mission mode according to a time frame for completion, which is also decided by&#13;
the community.&#13;
&#13;
After all individual household latrines (IHHLs) have been constructed, the VWSC also takes the&#13;
responsibility for the construction of school toilets. Some VWSCs have formulated local rules â&#128;&#147;&#13;
any individual who practices OD or does not use the toilets constructed is fined. The instances of&#13;
non-usage of constructed toilets are almost zero since toilets are constructed by the community&#13;
after fully understanding the importance of toilets and the methods of safe disposal of excreta.&#13;
The VWSCs are given multiple options of technology for the design of the toilet and they make&#13;
an informed choice. No one technology â&#128;&#147; single pit, double pit, septic tank, simple pit toilet, etc&#13;
â&#128;&#147; is imposed on the VWSCs.&#13;
&#13;
Today, following this approach, 134 of the 900 villages of East Garo Hills have achieved 100&#13;
per cent sanitation. The district aims to become a Nirmal district within the next one year.&#13;

CLTS Story of Asiragre Village&#13;
&#13;
Asiragre was the first village to achieve 100 per cent sanitation following the CLTS approach.&#13;
The village has 51 households. Before the intervention, only six households had safe toilets;&#13;
42 had unsafe toilets; and members of three households were defecating in the open. When&#13;
the facilitator team made its first visit to the village, most of the villagers felt that since 94 per&#13;
cent of the households in the village had toilets (42 unsafe and six safe toilets), sanitation was&#13;
not an issue in their village. The challenge for the facilitator team was to make the community&#13;
understand that their existing toilets did not provide for the safe disposal of excreta and that they&#13;
were as good as non existent.&#13;
&#13;
The concept of a â&#128;&#152;toiletâ&#128;&#153; as the sub-structure with a pan, a water seal and a properly sealed pit&#13;
allowing for the safe disposal of excreta was brought home to the community using innovative&#13;
triggering/training tools developed by the facilitators. Once the community realised the gravity&#13;
of the situation, a VWSC was formed. Within a week, the entire village including men, women,&#13;
youth and children did social work and collected all the local materials â&#128;&#147; stone, bamboo,&#13;
sand, etc, and approached the DWSC for further assistance to construct new, safe toilets. The&#13;
DWSC released the money under TSC to all the below poverty line (BPL) households of the&#13;
village according to the norms. However, the community realised that there were some non-&#13;
BPL households which needed a new, safe toilet but did not have enough money for their&#13;
construction. At this stage, the VWSC made a resolution to use the money sanctioned by&#13;
the DWSC for BPL households as a village sanitation fund and to procure materials for all&#13;
households which needed safe toilets. The entire community contributed their labour; two&#13;
youth who were trained as master masons ensured that all households constructed safe toilets.&#13;
The master masons were paid wages amounting to the one-day National Rural Employment&#13;
Guarantee Scheme wage of all the households.&#13;
&#13;
Today the village has 100 per cent IHHLs.&#13;
Every villager knows and understands not&#13;
just the importance of toilets but also the&#13;
concept of a safe toilet. Since the toilets&#13;
were built by the people themselves, there&#13;
is no doubt about the continuous usage&#13;
and sustainability of the results achieved.&#13;
The president of the Asiragre VWSC, a&#13;
champion of CLTS, was also trained as a&#13;
master mason. He is now spreading the&#13;
CLTS story and safe sanitation practices in&#13;
the other villages of the district.&#13;

Waste to Wealth: An Experiment in Schools&#13;
Location: Tirur Block (Malappuram District), Kerala&#13;
&#13;
Tirur Block in Malappuram district of Kerala has adopted an innovative approach to convert waste in the schools&#13;
into wealth â&#128;&#147; through establishing a bio-gas plant in the school. Waste management is a major problem in the&#13;
schools: given that 85 per cent of the things dumped as waste are actually resources in the wrong place, the necessity&#13;
of correct practices for waste management is imperative.&#13;
&#13;
To sensitise the younger generation of this fact, the Tirur block panchayat (BP) constructed a bio-gas plant (8 m3&#13;
digester able to digest 75 kg bio-waste) in Government VHSS, BP Angadi, in Talakkad gram panchayat (GP). With&#13;
around 2300 students on the rolls, the remains of the mid-day meal and the lunch brought by children is turned into&#13;
bio-gas. A nearby hotel run by â&#128;&#152;Kudubashreeâ&#128;&#153; can also use this for its waste disposal. This in turn meets part of the fuel&#13;
needs for cooking the mid-day meal. Slurry is used as manure for the school garden. Seventy-five per cent of the project&#13;
cost of Rs 1.2 lakh was met from the waste management fund of the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) and the rest&#13;
from the yearly plan of the block panchayat.&#13;
&#13;
The waste from the school kitchen and food remains thrown away by the children used to make the surroundings&#13;
dirty and a perfect breeding ground for diseases. As part of the â&#128;&#152;Malinya Muktha Keralamâ&#128;&#153; campaign, of the&#13;
Government of Kerala had formulated detailed guidelines for setting up waste management plants. The Tirur BP,&#13;
under the guidance of the District Coordinator of the TSC, formulated a plan for setting up a bio-gas plant for&#13;
transforming this waste into a resource, that is, fuel for the mid-day meal and slurry/manure for the school garden.&#13;
&#13;
This unit is meant to be a display unit to show children how waste can be managed scientifically and turned into a&#13;
useful resource. The plan for this unit was evolved in the meeting of the working group of BP held for the preparation&#13;
of an annual action plan. This was vetted by the district-level Technical Advisory Group on Drinking Water and&#13;
Sanitation. Discussions were held with representatives of the school parent-teacher association (PTA), and their support&#13;
ensured. A government-approved agency with a good track record in this field was selected for implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability is a major factor in the case of such plants; operation and maintenance, thus, was properly planned. Under&#13;
the supervision of the PTA, health club/green club members formed maintenance committees which maintains and&#13;
operates the plant without complaint. The plant has been operating successfully till date, with the help of the school&#13;
authorities, especially with the help of some dedicated teachers.&#13;
&#13;
As the initial project was recognised as a success, Tirurâ&#128;&#153;s BP undertook the construction of four more bio-gas plants&#13;
in the yearly plan of 2009â&#128;&#147;10 (in GUPS Purathur; Padinjarakkara GUPS, Purathur GP; GUPS Chamravattom,&#13;
Triprangod GP; and GMUPS Kottathara, Talakkad GP, with student strengths of 800 on an average). Vettom GP&#13;
under Tirur block constructed one plant in GMUPS Paravanna using Nirmal Gram Puraskar (NGP) funds. All are&#13;
functioning properly. Purathur GP has initiated action for the construction of two plants in GHS Purathur and&#13;
GMLPS Muttannur with NGP funds. The BP has approved plans for constructing one at the block headquarters,&#13;
where a canteen is functioning. In case of schools situated in market places, vegetable, fish or chicken merchants use&#13;
this facility to get rid of their waste and the schools get more fuel for their needs.&#13;

Building Capacities and Conviction to&#13;
Scale up Sanitation&#13;
Location: Kurukshetra District, Haryana&#13;
In 2003-04, Haryana had the highest per capita income level in India at current prices, while being plagued by one&#13;
of the highest expenditures on health. As per the 2001 Census, in rural Haryana, 52 per cent of the households had&#13;
televisions, 76 per cent had radios but only 29 per cent had toilets in their houses. This clearly indicated that non-&#13;
availability of toilets was not due to economic reasons but due to lack of awareness about the benefits of accessing&#13;
toilets within the household. The lack of awareness about sanitation and better hygiene practices also resulted in&#13;
unnecessary expenditure on health and loss of income because of productive days wasted due to sickness. Under&#13;
the Total Sanitation Campaign, Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS)1 was first proposed to be put in use by&#13;
organising training programmes for trainers with the help of experts from outside the state. This provided key inputs&#13;
in the conceptualisation and implementation of the strategy.2&#13;
&#13;
Capacity Building to Facilitate Behaviour Change in Sanitation Practices&#13;
&#13;
The catalyst of the CLTS approach in initiating, progressing and upholding the communitiesâ&#128;&#153; behaviour change are the&#13;
trainers. They continuously inform, energise and motivate the state, district, block and village level functionaries so that&#13;
the ignited community finds an informed, committed and skilled implementation support to achieve the ultimate goal&#13;
of being and living in an open defecation free environment. The maximum impact in Haryana was seen with the first&#13;
five-day Training of Trainersâ&#128;&#153; (TOT) workshop conducted in Bhiwani district in July 2006. Between this and 2009 the&#13;
state has been the fastest in adopting sanitary habits and practices and its measurement in terms of the Nirmal Gram&#13;
Puraskar (NGP)-awarded villages. CLTS has, during this period, built the capacities of 950 participants in every district,&#13;
leading to efficient and effective up scaling and creating a revolution with records broken and targets met.&#13;
&#13;
To build capacity, a five-day district level workshop â&#128;&#147; consisting of class room, hands-on field-based and simulation&#13;
exercises in the actual community â&#128;&#147; was conducted. The district and block team then moved to the villages and&#13;
â&#128;&#152;triggeredâ&#128;&#153; the community for achieving open defecation free (ODF) outcomes. In the process the capacities of&#13;
the â&#128;&#152;Nigrani Samitisâ&#128;&#153; (vigilance committee of natural leaders), at the village level, on ways to monitor community&#13;
members from going out to defecate, was also demonstrated. Thus the capacity building initiative is not restricted&#13;
to TOT workshops but seamlessly extends to the actual implementation of the CLTS approach in the field. For&#13;
example, Sirsa has made it to the Limca Book of Records, in making all 313 gram panchayats ODF, within a span of&#13;
90 days, with the leadership of the Assistant District Collector (ADC). In Kurukshetra the race was led by the ADC.&#13;
&#13;
Ensuring Sustainability of the Changed Practice&#13;
&#13;
The entire state of Haryana is climbing the ladder of total sanitation, with the scaling up of the CLTS approach.&#13;
The key lies in creating an adequate number, and building capacity, of master trainers at the district levels,&#13;
motivators at block level and â&#128;&#152;Nigrani Samitisâ&#128;&#153;, at the village level. The capacity building aspect in Haryana has been&#13;
complemented with the following factors to ensure its sustainability:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
  CLTS or Community Led Total Sanitation is an approach which facilitates communities to collectively analyse the status of sanitation, its&#13;
impact on their well-being, and thereby collectively act to change the status and become open defecation free.&#13;

&amp;#12;From Dreams to Reality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 A clear mission towards making the entire state free from open defecation since 2006 with continuous&#13;
   monitoring, policies, institutional arrangements, roles and responsibilities, etc.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Senior level administrators at state, district and block levels have demonstrated high levels of motivation.&#13;
   Numerous champions of sanitation have emerged in the state at all levels.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 A state-wide availability, accessibility and affordability of necessary material with regard to the supply chain needs&#13;
   of the communities, and establishment of a pool of readily available trained masons at every district level, to&#13;
   support this supply chain system. The capacity of the masons at districts has been built by involving them as a&#13;
   part of the CLTS ToT workshops.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Haryana has designed vigilant monitoring systems to measure progress at the gram panchayat, block, district and&#13;
   state levels. Community-based monitoring and monitoring by block, district and state teams, forms an integral part&#13;
   of the state sanitation mission. At the community level a participatory monitoring map is used as a tool to monitor&#13;
   individual/ household behaviour change. At the block, district and state levels the use of tools on community visits&#13;
   are walk of pride and giving preference to becoming ODF rather than focussing on the number of toilets constructed&#13;
   â&#128;&#147; which have proved to be extremely effective.&#13;
&#13;
Initiatives for Scaling Up&#13;
&#13;
This process has been replicated across the state. Starting with one district in 2006, this has now been replicated and&#13;
adopted across all 21 districts of Haryana. The state had zero villages under NGP in 2006; this became 60 in 2007,&#13;
798 in 2008, and 131 in 2009. In 2010 nearly 1,350 villages have applied for the NGPs.&#13;
&#13;
Main Achievements&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 A pool of master trainers created across the state to â&#128;&#152;triggerâ&#128;&#153; the villages.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Trained local resources are now functioning as the state-level team for scaling up CLTS.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Sanitation, which was early a low-priority agenda in Haryana, has emerged as a high-priority issue at the policy&#13;
   level, brought on by conviction among key government functionaries.&#13;
&#13;
Key Learning&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Strong demand from the state/districts is required, along with a commitment to scale up the initiative.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Careful selection of trainers who would be dedicated and available full-time for a minimum period of six months&#13;
   is necessary to ensure scaling up of the approach.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Apart from knowledge and skill development, the training should be designed to develop right attitude and build&#13;
   conviction towards the approach amongst participants.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Action planning has to be done for three months during the workshop so that there is clarity among participants&#13;
   about how to scale up&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Institutional support to implement the action plan is an absolute necessity.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Follow-up workshops after three months are crucial for sharing experiences and filling in knowledge gaps.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Strengthening the monitoring and evaluation system is important for strengthening the momentum achieved post&#13;
   the TOT workshop.&#13;
&#13;
The success of this approach can probably be best gauged by a news item which appeared in a news website in March&#13;
2009: â&#128;&#156;The war against insanitation is being fought by women in Haryana by placing a simple condition before their&#13;
daughters get married â&#128;&#147; her new household should have a toilet.â&#128;?&#13;

            India - From dreams to reality : Compendium
            of best practices in rural sanitation in India
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A decade after the Total Sanitation
            Campaign was launched, India has seen significant success in
            terms of the sanitation coverage, creating open defecation
            communities/GPs, and solid and liquid waste management.
            Thousands of success stories have emerged across the
            country; however, there are still many challenges ahead. As
            part of advocacy and capacity building through knowledge
            sharing, the Government of India, with assistance from Water
            and Sanitation Program, has brought out this document by
            compiling various best practices in achieving total
            sanitation at different levels. The main objectives of the
            assignment are (a) to identify and document the best
            practices in implementing rural sanitation programs at a
            district/block/GP level by creating and sustaining open
            defecation free (ODF) status; and (b) to draw lessons for
            replication throughout the country by disseminating the best
            practices to achieve sustainable total sanitation. This
            compendium contains the case studies of best practices in
            achieving total sanitation at different levels, that is,
            GP/block/districts. These case studies are about the
            achievements and the experiences of different situations,
            institutional models, community mobilization approaches,
            supply chain management, capacity building, convergence of
            various programs, school sanitation, innovative approaches
            etc, in different states and the regions. The report consist
            of two main sections: Village-level Case Studies, and
            State/District-level Case Studies.
