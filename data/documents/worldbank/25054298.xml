Montene2ro Additional Financing EU/IPA Agriculture and Rural Development Institution&#13;
Building Single-Donor&#13;
Trust Fund Description&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of the Administration Agreement for the Trust&#13;
Fund between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
I.     Background information&#13;
1.    Following the Decision of the European Council in December 2010 that gave Montenegro the&#13;
status of a Candidate Country, Montenegro became eligible for the support under the Rural Development&#13;
Component of the European Union Instrument of Pre-accession Assistance (IPA). However, as the&#13;
conditions for conferral of management power to the Montenegrin operating structure were not met, it&#13;
was decided to reallocate the 2012/2013 IPA funds from the Rural Development Component to the&#13;
Transition Assistance and Institution Building Component.&#13;
2.     Consequently, the adoption of the IPA Rural Development (IPARD) Programme for Montenegro&#13;
submitted to the European Commission on 27th of April 2012, was suspended in order to focus efforts on&#13;
the preparation of an Agriculture and Rural Development Programme for the period 2014-2020.&#13;
3.    In parallel, selected measures for rural development will be implemented by the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) with the financial support of the European Union in&#13;
partnership with the World Bank, in order to allow for a smooth preparation of the Montenegrin operating&#13;
structure in charge of the management of future EU rural development funds. This support is the purpose&#13;
of this Project.&#13;
4.     The Commission and the World Bank Group collaborate closely in Montenegro. Since the early&#13;
stages of the design of the Montenegro Institutional Development Agricultural Strengthening (MIDAS)&#13;
Project, the World Bank Group has closely coordinated with the Commission to ensure capturing all the&#13;
possible synergies between the IPA 2008, IPA 2011 Twinning Projects and other activities funded by the&#13;
Commission, and the MIDAS Project. The MIDAS supported five grants program consecutive rounds,&#13;
with a step-wise-approach, starting with the principles of the Instrument for Pre-Accession, Rural&#13;
Development Component and later on adopting progressively IPARD rules. In parallel, MARD is&#13;
preparing its national accreditation package for the management of future EU funds for rural&#13;
development.&#13;
5.     Based on the above, an Administration Agreement between the EU and the World Bank Group&#13;
was signed on July 10, 2014, and subsequently a Grant of Euro 3,385,308 was extended to Montenegro&#13;
from the World Bank acting as an administrator of grant funds provided by the EU to support the&#13;
Montenegro EU/IPA Agriculture and Rural Development Institution Building Project. This Project is&#13;
supporting one or more additional rounds of the grants program, aiming to further introduce IPARD core&#13;
measures and rules, while continuing to strengthen the capacity of all involved institutions. The grant&#13;
scheme funded under this Project is benefitting from the lessons learned and progress made in the&#13;
implementation of MIDAS grants. Support is being provided also to strengthen the capacities of the&#13;
MARD's Sector for Rural Development (future Managing Authority) and Sector for Payment (future&#13;
Paying Agency), which will make the scheme one step closer to IPARD. The project builds on the lessons&#13;
being learned under MIDAS to further improve delivery of government assistance and access to financing&#13;
in a manner consistent with the pre-accession assistance requirements.&#13;
-4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿6.     As indicated in the Financing Agreement entered into by the government of Montenegro and the&#13;
EU represented by the European Commission, dated December 19, 2013 and January 31, 2014 and its&#13;
subsequent amendments, concerning the National Programme for Montenegro 2012 - 2013 Part 2 for the&#13;
year 2013 under the IPA Transition Assistance, EUR 5,285,467 were allocated the EU for strengthening&#13;
Montenegrin agriculture through IPARD like measures. The Commission hereby represents that&#13;
Montenegro has committed to co-finance the Project pursuant to the above-mentioned Financing&#13;
Agreement. The total amount of the Montenegrin contribution to this Project is expected to be&#13;
EUR 1,613,495 of which EUR 1,300,000 will be used for co-financing the implementation of the grant&#13;
scheme under Component 1 and EUR 313,495 will be used to support co-financing of the implementation&#13;
of Component 2.&#13;
II.    Objectives&#13;
The objectives of the Trust Fund are to (i) increase the experience of Montenegrin authorities in&#13;
administering rural development grants in accordance with the core rules of the European Union&#13;
Instrument of Pre-accession Assistance for Rural Development, and (ii) support upgrading towards EU&#13;
standards of agriculture holdings and agro-processing industry.&#13;

external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an&#13;
