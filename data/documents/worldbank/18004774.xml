&#13;
BECKER: Good morning--good afternoon. Today is April 5th, 2005, and Iâ&#128;&#153;m William Becker&#13;
with the [World] Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Oral History Program, and Iâ&#128;&#153;m here to interview--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Iâ&#128;&#153;m Nick [Nicholas] Stern. Iâ&#128;&#153;m currently Head of the Government Economic Service&#13;
in the UK [United Kingdom], former Chief Economist and Senior Vice President at the World&#13;
Bank from July 2000 to October 2003.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Very good. Itâ&#128;&#153;s nice to meet you. May I begin with some of the fairly obvious&#13;
questions of these interviews, and that is when and where were you born?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I was born in London, the 22nd of April 1946. So I am a real Londoner.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Real Londoner, okay. What influenced you to study mathematics at Cambridge&#13;
University?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, I was fascinated with mathematics itself and reasonably good at it. But I think&#13;
from the early days in Cambridge I knew that I didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to be a mathematician by trade, and I&#13;
wanted to apply those kinds of analytical skills that you get from mathematics to problems facing&#13;
the world. And Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been traveling pretty extensively since my mid teens. And, for example,&#13;
prior to going to university I spent a fair bit of time traveling around the United States, but also&#13;
in Mexico. And during my university life I traveled through the old Soviet Union into Iran and&#13;
back through Turkey. I drove with my younger brother.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Richard?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: No. Richardâ&#128;&#153;s my older brother.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, Iâ&#128;&#153;m sorry, okay.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I drove with my younger brother. I went to see Richard right after graduating in&#13;
mathematics, who was working--my older brother, who was working in Ethiopia for the, for the&#13;
UN [United Nations]. I worked on a kibbutz in Israel for a while. So between Mexico, Ethiopia,&#13;
and Iran I saw a fair bit of developing countries in the period when I was studying mathematics.&#13;
And I had been very active in politics as a teenager in the UK, UK politics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So a combination of political activism as a student and indeed as a school boy, and the direct&#13;
exposure to some of the problems of developing countries. By the time I was halfway through&#13;
my mathematics career in university, Cambridge, I was pretty clear that I wanted to do&#13;
economics, that I wanted to try to change the world. I think I was already aware that the world&#13;
was quite an intractable place, but I did know that I wanted to try to make a difference.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. And so you selected to--you selected Oxford to do a doctorate--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yeah. I did a fourth year. Normally British undergraduate degrees are three years,&#13;
and my mathematics degree was indeed three years, but I did a fourth year, as it were, converting&#13;
to economics at Cambridge, and then I did my doctorate at Oxford.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Did you select Oxford because there were some development economists there that&#13;
particularly interested you or that you knew about?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I went to Oxford largely because my supervisor, who was then in his early 30s, a chap&#13;
called James Mirrlees got a chair at Oxford, and I was already working with him and he asked&#13;
me to come with him, and I jumped at the chance. And about 20 years later he got the Nobel&#13;
Prize for the kind of work he was doing at that time. I knew I was working with somebody good.&#13;
History revealed just how good somebody I was working with turned out to be. So it was really&#13;
Jim Mirrlees who took me to Oxford.&#13;
&#13;
But when I did get there I started to work quite closely with a number of very distinguished&#13;
people in the development area, particularly Ian Little, who with Jim Mirrlees, wrote a&#13;
tremendously powerful book on cost benefit analysis and planning. Itâ&#128;&#153;s called Project Appraisal&#13;
and Planning for Developing Countries. That was a very influential book and I started working&#13;
with Ian on some of the applications. So before I finished my Ph.D., and indeed it turned out to&#13;
be part of my Ph.D., I went off to Kenya to look at smallholder tea plots. So it was the hills of&#13;
Kenya which was my first strong exposure to analytics of development as opposed to some of&#13;
the traveling I had been doing before, which was more sort of observation.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see. Now, what was your doctoral thesis?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It was on growth and location. It was actually quite mathematical about the theory of&#13;
optimal growth as applied to investment in developing countries, and theories of location, i.e.,&#13;
where the economic activity should take place.&#13;
&#13;
But I was already getting involved in the applied story and I did have a chapter on tea in the&#13;
thesis.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: When you became an academic which--did you become an academic once you got&#13;
your degree or--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I actually got my first teaching job before I got my doctorate. A few months before&#13;
my doctorate--I finished the doctorate while I was already teaching at Oxford University and at&#13;
St. Catherineâ&#128;&#153;s College at Oxford University.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Did you teach development economics?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yeah. I taught about mathematical economics and development.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And then you left Oxford to take a position?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: University of Warwick. That was--I started teaching at Oxford in â&#128;&#153;69 and â&#128;&#153;70, and then&#13;
I got a chair in Warwick and I started there in â&#128;&#153;78. And then I moved from Warwick to the LSE&#13;
[London School of Economics] in â&#128;&#153;86. LSE is probably my intellectual home and where I guess&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;ll eventually end up if they still want me.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, while you were an academic, you began to spend time in--is it Palanpur?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yeah. The tea in Kenya was â&#128;&#153;69, and then I went to India in 1974 to work on&#13;
agricultural change and the way in which economic development and agricultural change interact&#13;
and how markets in rural communities work, and in particular how rural people, agriculturalists&#13;
and others, take their economic decisions. Particular focus then on wheat, because that was the&#13;
heady days of the Green Revolution in India, and lots of discussion about the way in which&#13;
adoption of new technologies took place, what their effects were, how they influenced and were&#13;
influenced by markets. So that was a particular focus of the story.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How did that come about?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Iâ&#128;&#153;d always had the British romantic attraction to India. It's in all our books in history,&#13;
stories and so on. But also, if you think back to the '60s, we all saw India as a great challenge at&#13;
that time. There were hundreds of millions of people, a lot of pessimism, and you had to ask&#13;
yourself how India would change. And then suddenly you got the Green Revolution story, it&#13;
looks as if something is happening in agriculture, it's very important to understand what that was.&#13;
So India was important to the Brits for historical reasons.&#13;
&#13;
But it was also the huge development challenge that many of us saw. And, of course, there's the&#13;
language issue. It's easier to work in a country where at least English is used some of the time in&#13;
some of the places. So it was a combination of those things. The particular precipitation was&#13;
some very good Indian friends, T.N. Srinivasan from Yale, where he--he's at Yale now but he&#13;
was then at the Indian Statistical Institute in Delhi and T.N. arranged the practical details.&#13;
Manmohan Singh and Amartya Sen were friends from that time too. So good Indian friends who&#13;
were encouraging me as well, and T.N. Srinivasan, who facilitated the actual story. I met T.N.&#13;
when I was on leave at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] in 1972.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see. And so you spent--somewhere I read the growing season--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: The growing seasons in North India are called Rabi and Kharif. Rabi is the--R-a-b-i--&#13;
is the winter season, which goes roughly speaking from October to April. And Kharif is slightly&#13;
shorter, summer season. So we were there from around October to April for most of the time,&#13;
which is right through the Rabi season. But then weâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been going back to Palanpur as often&#13;
as I can for much of the period after '74, at least up to the mid '90s, it was every year.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Now, how has that experience influenced your thinking about poverty and&#13;
development?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Those two experiences, I think, in Kenya in '69 and in India '74, â&#128;&#152;75 and going back to&#13;
India constantly and Palanpur constantly, had a very profound influence. I saw in Kenya, for&#13;
example, the way in which a public/private partnership could really work to make development&#13;
happen. You had mostly women on smallholder plots embarking on a new crop, and doing it in&#13;
a way which was vegetatively propagated, sort of newish techniques at that time, which they&#13;
were learning. They were taking a big risk on part of their land on a crop which doesn't really&#13;
start to pay off for at least five years, you had to wait for the bushes to grow. And so you needed&#13;
the private entrepreneurship, willingness to invest, for the African farmers, and you needed&#13;
technological innovation, with new product, tea and vegetative propagation. You needed the&#13;
road to get the tea to the factories, and those roads were largely public sector roads, mostly&#13;
tarmacs, because tea grows well when it's wet and high, and dirt roads don't work so well when&#13;
it's wet and slopy. So you needed the roads. And you need the tea factories, and the tea--you&#13;
can't make good tea in the factory--you can't make bad tea leaf into good tea in the pot, but you&#13;
can certainly make good leaf into bad tea by lousy factory processing. So it was very important&#13;
to have processing that was up to the quality of the surroundings and the tea that was being&#13;
made, which was very high quality, and the land is good for tea. The climate's good for tea.&#13;
&#13;
These were private sector factories doing most of the marketing. So you had a government&#13;
organizing payment systems, credit and so on. A very intricate package actually of public and&#13;
private partnerships, private being from the very small tea grower to the larger tea factory, and&#13;
then you had infrastructures for the roads and you had extension services and credit, so the&#13;
government was also key. So it was a very complex public/private partnership. We didn't use&#13;
the language public/private partnership then. That was in the '60s.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah, right.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: But it is as sophisticated a story as you get now, where we've been using this kind of&#13;
language very much and it really works.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Was the Bank or the UN involved in these programs?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: The UK Commonwealth Development Corporation was involved, and I think the&#13;
Bank/IFC [International Finance Corporation] was involved as well. So it was supported. This&#13;
was about five or six years after independence, and when African governments were less&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
problematic than they became in the â&#128;&#153;70s and â&#128;&#153;80s. So this whole thing is, was, a wonderful&#13;
example and very, very modern, actually, even though it was designed in the â&#128;&#153;60s really. And&#13;
that created a profound impression on me, you know, what state and private sector could do&#13;
when they work together, and the entrepreneurship of smallholders. Again, I saw the&#13;
entrepreneurship--&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And women too.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Particularly of women in this case.&#13;
&#13;
And then the entrepreneurship again of smallholders in India, you know, drilling their own wells,&#13;
ten centimeter bore holes, which you sort of get together, somehow raise the capital for, and then&#13;
use your own sweat to dig. And you get the entrepreneurship around somebody managing to buy&#13;
a pumping set which you move around. You donâ&#128;&#153;t leave that outside, of course, but a diesel&#13;
pumping set that you put on top of the hole. Prior to that theyâ&#128;&#153;d been investing a lot in Persian&#13;
wheels, different kind of chain-bucket system with chains, the chain and bucket is driven around&#13;
by ox.&#13;
&#13;
So these people were investing, particularly in irrigation, in their own land, and they were giving&#13;
these new varieties a try. And these were very, very poor people, as they have been in Kenya,&#13;
and making really entrepreneurial investments changed their lives. I became convinced right&#13;
from the start in my 20s working on development that entrepreneurship was everywhere. And a&#13;
lot of the story of development was about facilitating entrepreneurship by poor people, and there&#13;
were lots you could do to help it along and lots you could do to stultify it.&#13;
&#13;
I then, much later, became Chief Economist of the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction&#13;
and Development] in London and saw the way in which entrepreneurship could flower even in&#13;
the sort of places of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union where it had been suppressed.&#13;
&#13;
And then I lived and worked in China in the late 1980s and saw how the Chinese people were&#13;
already responding in an entrepreneurial way. So that entrepreneurial spirit of ordinary people&#13;
from India, from Africa, rural Africa, and rural India, to China and the former Soviet Union&#13;
struck me right through my career, but the seeds were sown really for me--&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In Kenya.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: --in Kenya and India.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And the same--I was going to ask--the same or similar conclusions from your&#13;
experience in India?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Oh, absolutely. I mean the Indian entrepreneurship from the guys switching over to&#13;
high-yielding varieties of wheat and investing in their own land was really very striking. Now, it&#13;
didn't always work terribly well. There was a fair amount of shambles involved, people didn't do&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the full work, so they didnâ&#128;&#153;t follow the full advice, but they were making big investments for&#13;
them. And they saw an opportunity, they looked around them, they were aware, and theyâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
ready to take the risks.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Did you begin to use these insights in your academic writing in, say, the later&#13;
â&#128;&#153;70s and into the â&#128;&#153;80s?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, I wrote the book on the Kenyan story, which did go beyond the narrow cost-&#13;
benefit remit--it was a small book, not with wide publication, but it was a book that did go&#13;
beyond the narrow cost/benefit, and I started to try to ask, well, how do these things happen?&#13;
Whatâ&#128;&#153;s involved in making them happen? Similarly in--I wrote a book with Christopher Bliss.&#13;
We worked together on the Palanpur story, which came out in the early '80s about the whole&#13;
Palanpur experience. So we tried to draw some of those lessons of the way in which people took&#13;
decisions.&#13;
&#13;
I think as time went by I came to lay greater stress on the entrepreneurial institutional story than I&#13;
did at the time. But I think we did that we recognized it pretty clearly at the time. But probably&#13;
writing the book again, I would give a less technical slant to it and a stronger institution&#13;
behavioral slant.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You've mentioned the EBRD and I wanted to ask you, you made the transition in&#13;
1994 from academic life to the public sphere when you became the Chief Economist and Special&#13;
Counsel to the President of the EBRD. That's correct?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How did that appointment come about?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: There's a funny story. Depends how far back you want to go, but John Flemming was&#13;
the first Chief Economist of the EBRD and a good friend. In academic life you know most of the&#13;
people and the potential appointees in these kind of jobs. John decided in 1992, after he had&#13;
been there quite a short time that he would take up the headship at Wadham College in Oxford,&#13;
which he did do. He was living in Oxford, it was a natural thing for him to do. And he let me&#13;
know that he was doing that and he said I was one of the names he was going to recommend to&#13;
Jacques Attali, who was the then President, the first President of EBRD. I knew they were&#13;
looking around for other people. In particular I knew they were thinking of Michael Bruno, and&#13;
Michael was a friend for more than 20 years. I knew that Attali was talking to Bruno as well,&#13;
and eventually Attali decided to offer it to Bruno. And that was fine.&#13;
&#13;
But Bruno then, Michael Bruno, went on talking to Attali about the job, and before he took up&#13;
the job he became more and more worried about what kind of job he had accepted. He was also&#13;
being wooed by the World Bank at that time, and I had also been considered at that time for the&#13;
World Bank. This was '92, '93, and Michael eventually pulled out and said, "Look, you know, I&#13;
can't trust the promises that are being made to me about the nature of this job.â&#128;? But, â&#128;&#156;I would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Nicholas Stern&#13;
                               April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
prefer to be here rather than in Washington," because his family was going to stay in Israel. He&#13;
eventually decided to pull out of that. And not long after he was offered the job, which he&#13;
accepted, of Chief Economist at the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
And I stayed very close to Michael. We were good friends whilst all this lot was going on. And&#13;
Attali, after Michael told him he didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to come after all, so he sort of resigned before&#13;
taking on the job, Attali called me and said, "Would you like the job?" All that time he was still&#13;
talking to Michael, trying to persuade him to change his mind, so there was a fair bit of&#13;
deviousness that went on. But I was talking to Michael all the way through this.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So you knew what was happening.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: We were good friends, and we stayed good friends right until Michael died. But for&#13;
me it was a quite small risk. I mean, LSE is four subway stops from EBRD, and I got leave from&#13;
LSE. So I wasnâ&#128;&#153;t taking a big risk. But then Attali finally appointed me in June of â&#128;&#153;93, and about&#13;
a week later he was forced out of office. Happily, there was no connection between my&#13;
appointment and him being forced out of office.&#13;
&#13;
So I ended up--and it was a great privilege for me to spend more than four years working with&#13;
Jacques de Larosiere because he was brought in. And he was an absolute dream to work for and&#13;
weâ&#128;&#153;ve stayed good friends, kind of uncle figure for me. And there was a small group of us,&#13;
perhaps four, four or five people under his leadership who turned round the EBRD. So it was&#13;
quite an experience for me.&#13;
&#13;
I was thrown into an institution in turmoil and I was asked by Jacques de Larosiere actually&#13;
before formally I took up the job, to work on a strategy for the EBRD. And this idea just took&#13;
two or three months with a small group team, four or five people, and we put together--we talked&#13;
a lot to the board, stakeholders, the clients, and we put together a strategy for the EBRD which&#13;
was essentially implemented by the Bank and Jacques de Larosiere. It was a very simple&#13;
strategy saying, you know, go further east, invest more in equity, do more private sector and&#13;
focus more on financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
And I became convinced then that the strategy for these international institutions was of great&#13;
importance, and that if you could keep it simple, then people would know what it was, and&#13;
people knew what we had said. They knew we were saying go further east, less concentration in&#13;
Central Europe, do more in the private sector, do more in finance and more equity. And they--&#13;
most people in the Bank knew those things and they knew that these were the ideas. They rather&#13;
liked the ideas. And it happened.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: When you developed this strategy with this team, how did you go about that? I&#13;
mean did you--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, we talked a lot to the shareholders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I was going to ask you, yeah, okay.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Talked a lot to the shareholders for the Board. We talked to clients in many--you&#13;
know, both governments and private sector clients. We talked to staff. You know, staff at that&#13;
time, they were people who had been drawn into a new venture and it was still a young bank, it&#13;
was only two or three years old. And they had been there long enough to think through the&#13;
problems but not so long that they were jaundiced or set in their ways. So the staff there were&#13;
very helpful, productive, on all this as well.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: As an academic Iâ&#128;&#153;m always interested in how institutions develop their ideas. I&#13;
mean academics develop their ideas in a particular way, and in an institution, it always seems to&#13;
me, itâ&#128;&#153;s a team or a group effort.&#13;
&#13;
What was the magnitude of the--or whatâ&#128;&#153;s the size of the EBRDâ&#128;&#153;s budget, letâ&#128;&#153;s say, compared to&#13;
the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s budget in this period of time when you were there?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: The EBRD was lending at that time something around one-and-a-half, two billion&#13;
euros a year. It had around 1,000 people. And it had an administrative budget of--it was around&#13;
100,000 per person, so an administrative budget of the order of, if I remember correctly, 1,000&#13;
people times about 100,000 pounds, which would be on the order of 100 million pounds a year,&#13;
very roughly speaking. So 100 or a 100-and-some million pounds a year budget, and a euro&#13;
portfolio of around one-and-a-half to a billion per annum, the flow. For some reason we did&#13;
administrative expenses in pounds and flows in euros.&#13;
&#13;
I think itâ&#128;&#153;s still about 1,000 people, but I think their flow is up to three billion or more now,&#13;
euros.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Did you have much administrative responsibility in the job?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I didnâ&#128;&#153;t have a huge staff. I had a very good team, very high-quality team of 16 or 17&#13;
people, economists, which I built up, which is a fraction of 1,000 people. It was not tiny, given&#13;
that itâ&#128;&#153;s very much a business, private sector-oriented bank, but they are very good, and right&#13;
from the beginning we were very clear that we wanted to be part of the decision making story,&#13;
that we wanted to bring our analytical skills to help form a strategy and to ask the question&#13;
whether the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s projects were really promoting the transition, because the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s projects&#13;
were put together largely by deal makers. Itâ&#128;&#153;s an investment bank, and they were good. But they&#13;
were after a deal and constructing the deal, and it was our job to try to get a portfolio of deals and&#13;
structure the individual deals in a way that made an impact on the transition, because the purpose&#13;
of the EBRD was to promote the transition from a command to a market economy.&#13;
&#13;
So that was fascinating to work with people who were essentially business people and to try to&#13;
shape the portfolio activities and the individual activities so that they had what we called&#13;
transition impact. Now, from the World Bank it would be development. So we created that&#13;
really. We created the analytical structures and the atmosphere so that the bankers after a bit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Nicholas Stern&#13;
                                April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
started to internalize what we were saying, and they would argue that their projects were very&#13;
good for the transition, and they did it in an increasingly sophisticated way, building on the kinds&#13;
of approaches that we put together.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, was EBRD, what part of its business was focused on the former Soviet Union&#13;
and what on Central Europe?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It had 26 countriesâ&#128;&#153; operations then, I think, but they were essentially, as you said, the&#13;
Central European story, and then the former Soviet Union. I think it was roughly 50/50 if I&#13;
remember.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now your experience--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: This in terms of number of countries.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Countries, right.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Of course population was dominated by Russia.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How did your experience at the European bank, how did that influence your&#13;
thinking about development and poverty?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It really focused me on something which I hadn't articulated before and that was the&#13;
investment climate. We developed at that time through, for example, the transition reports,&#13;
which we did a transition report each year on the progress of the transition. So we actually had&#13;
measures for how far the transition was going in terms of private sector initiative, in terms of the&#13;
quality of corporate governance, in terms of economic policy, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
I think we were probably the first in the field in measuring the investment climate and the&#13;
process of transitioning, because that was our mandate. It became an industry later on with&#13;
governance and investment climate surveys and so on, but we were trying to sort of feel our way&#13;
there.&#13;
&#13;
So I became convinced of the importance of the investment climate and the possibility of&#13;
articulating it in an analytical way at the EBRD. So I brought some of those insights, I hope, to&#13;
the World Bank, where as you may know, I was very strong on investment climateâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, that's my next set of questions--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: --in the World Bank. But I was six years there so I learned a lot about international&#13;
institutions, I learned a lot about working with boards, I worked very closely with the board right&#13;
from the moment I started on the strategy story, because that was very much a board orientation.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And you obviously learned a lot about how investment bankers operate, too.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Nicholas Stern&#13;
                               April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I did. I did. And there is a much stronger emphasis on the finance side of the story in&#13;
the EBRD than there is at the World Bank. So I was very lucky to have that opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, why did you decide in--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I learned about leadership from Jacques de Larosiere.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And leadership, okay. What is his background, by the way? Iâ&#128;&#153;m sorry to say--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Jacques de Larosiere was head of the French Treasury, a classic ENARC (graduate of&#13;
ENA) [Ecole nationale dâ&#128;&#153;administration]. And then he went to be the head of the IMF, and you&#13;
know, lived, for example, through the 1982 crisis as head of the IMF. Then he went to the Bank&#13;
of France, was Governor of the Bank of France. And then from there he went to be head of&#13;
EBRD, an incredible portfolio of public appointments.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, speaking of public appointments, you decide to leave the Bank in 1999.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I thought I'd go back to academic life. So I took it when they made me an offer of a&#13;
very nice chair at the LSE, called a school chair, like a university chair in the United States. And&#13;
I also did some part-time consultancy, so actually a combination of things. I took the chair only&#13;
half time, but I intended to become a proper academic again. But within a few months the offer&#13;
at the World Bank came along. That's when Joe [Joseph E.] Stiglitz left.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How did that come about? Did you know [James D.] Wolfensohn?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I knew Wolfensohn a bit.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: A bit.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Because as Chief Economist of the EBRD, one of my duties was to look after&#13;
relationships between the regional banks and the World Bank, and we used to meet as&#13;
development banks, every six months, so I was charged with some of the organization for that,&#13;
so I got to know Wolfensohn during that time. But I knew him only slightly. We liked each&#13;
other, but we didn't know each other particularly well, but I did know him.&#13;
&#13;
I knew Joe Stiglitz very well. I met Joe in 1969 in Kenya, and we were close friends from '69,&#13;
and still are. And when Joe decided to go, I was one of the names that obviously was being&#13;
trawled, and I had been considered to be Chief Economist at the World Bank on a number of&#13;
occasions before that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: And there was one occasion in particular when it seemed quite likely I would be&#13;
offered the job. This was when eventually Larry [Lawrence H.] Summers was offered the job.&#13;
And if Michael Bruno hadnâ&#128;&#153;t gone to the World Bank and instead gone to EBRD, then I might&#13;
have gone to World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Might have gone either way, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: So there were occasions in the past obviously, two quite serious occasions, where my&#13;
name had been considered, so it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t a surprise to be considered, I mean, twice being&#13;
considered before. And Joe Stiglitz and Amartya Sen were key characters along with Jeff&#13;
[Jeffrey] Goldstein, who was on the committee.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Goldstein?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Jeff Goldstein. Jeff Goldstein left the Bank about a year ago.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, right.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: And heâ&#128;&#153;s an investment banker.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s another Goldstein at the International Economic--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Is it Morris Goldstein?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: There is a Goldstein at--I thought it was Jeff, but anyway.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: No. This Jeff Goldstein is an investment banker. He came in as Managing Director of&#13;
the World Bank with Jim Wolfensohn.&#13;
&#13;
So thereâ&#128;&#153;s this little committee of three, two of whom I knew extremely well, Amartya Sen and&#13;
Joe Stiglitz, and Jeff Goldstein I didnâ&#128;&#153;t know. So they asked me to come and talk to them, which&#13;
I did do, and I was offered a job. So Joe was chair of that group and he--but it was the three of&#13;
them together who recommended to Jim that he appoint me.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: We scheduled Stiglitz more than once to do these interviews, and heâ&#128;&#153;s a very&#13;
difficult man to pin down.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I know. Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure you'll get there.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I hope. The advantage, from my point of view, during these--I bone up on these by&#13;
reading a lot of material about the people and a lot of what they've written. So I've read of what&#13;
you've written, I've read a lot of what Stiglitz has written. Now I want to talk to Stiglitz a bit, but&#13;
he goes missing all the time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Nicholas Stern&#13;
                               April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: We were together in China two weeks ago. We gave a talk on China and the world&#13;
economy together, double header. Heâ&#128;&#153;s a very good friend.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: May I ask just one thing about Stiglitz and all of this? One of the jobs that prepares&#13;
me is that I read all the newspapers, and there was a lot of speculation that Stiglitz was forced&#13;
out. I mean did you get that sense, that he and Wolfensohn had some kind of a--not a falling out&#13;
but Wolfensohn lost confidence in Stiglitz?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I think it was more complicated than that. Joe is very much his own person, and&#13;
doesnâ&#128;&#153;t live with constraints, doesnâ&#128;&#153;t take the easy way, that's part of the charm, but also part of&#13;
the problem. And Joe would say what he thought. And he'd say what he thought at that time and&#13;
itâ&#128;&#148;heâ&#128;&#153;d articulated that. So, for exampleâ&#128;&#148;I mean, he would comment on China's exchange rate&#13;
in public, and, you know, that's the kind of thing you have to be very careful about as Chief&#13;
Economist of the World Bank. He was increasingly unhappy with the severity of IMF programs,&#13;
and he felt that they slashed back far more than was appropriate to the circumstances, and he felt&#13;
that strongly in, say, Ethiopia. He felt that strongly about the East Asia crisis.&#13;
&#13;
So partly he would just say what he thought about big matters of economic policy, the Chinese&#13;
exchange rate. It causes--you can actually start messing up markets from that position. And&#13;
partly he was unhappy and articulated it with the way in which the IMF was going. So there&#13;
were those factors.&#13;
&#13;
But I think Jim Wolfensohn--and you should talk to him about it directly--I think Jim also&#13;
welcomed Joe's frankness and openness in the sense the Chief Economist can go a bit further&#13;
than the President at the Bank, and they worked very closely together, I think, on the&#13;
Comprehensive Development Framework.&#13;
&#13;
So it was quite a complicated relationship, with Jim appreciating Joe's distinction and frankness,&#13;
and whilst at the same time sometimes being brought into hot water through it.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I think particular problems for Jim in Joe's time, especially towards the end, were&#13;
relationships with the IMF and the US Treasury. And Joe did fall out very strongly with the&#13;
IMF, and he did fall out with Larry Summers.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: And I think both those things were actually quite serious relationship problems for&#13;
Jim. So, as I say, itâ&#128;&#153;s not quite as simple as loss of confidence. There were strands in these&#13;
things, and I think Jim saw the positives and the difficulties, and it's difficult to know exactly the&#13;
elements in who decided what, when.&#13;
&#13;
Joe doesn't stay places forever. Joe--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Nicholas Stern&#13;
                               April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: No, he moves around.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Joe moves around. You know, Joe himself may have felt this is time to--&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I guess heâ&#128;&#153;s at Columbia now, and--when we first started talking to him, I think we&#13;
were talking to him at--he went back to Stanford, and--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Again, Joe had been in that job I think about four years, which is quite a long time for&#13;
Joe.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Kind of long for him, yes.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: So I think it--I would be very careful about being too simple.&#13;
&#13;
And there was one final factor which affected me directly about Joe, was the World&#13;
Development Report 2000.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I have quite a few questions about that.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: So that was allegedly a bone of contention, particularly with Larry Summers, I think&#13;
exaggeratedly, actually.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Again, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve looked over the press, and it does seem to be that the treatment is a bit&#13;
hot, and--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Larry said--and I believe him--that he had never read it, that heâ&#128;&#153;s never read the draft&#13;
which he was reported to be infuriated by. There was a draft in January of 2000, which actually&#13;
as it happens I commented on at the meetings of the American Economic Association in January&#13;
of 2005 as an academic. I had gone back to LSE, Iâ&#128;&#153;d left EBRD, so I was a natural person to ask&#13;
to comment, because I had been working for international institutions, I was now back at the&#13;
LSE. And it became more and more contentious, and then Ravi Kanbur quit.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Quit, right. And that became a very big--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: And that became a big issue. So when I arrived--he quite just before--I think he quit--&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Three weeks before you arrived--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: He quit after I had been appointed, just before I--&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You arrived on July 1st --&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Nicholas Stern&#13;
                             April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yeah, but I was coming three or four days a week from March, so as soon as I was&#13;
appointed â&#128;&#147;not three or four days a week, three or four days a month. After, I think, March,&#13;
April, May, June, I was there three or four days a month, just starting to get going, so I did start&#13;
to get involved, and Ravi's position, you know, was uncomfortable. He looked very unhappy. I&#13;
mean, he looked physically down, and eventually he quit.&#13;
&#13;
Now, Amartya Sen and I, Mike [Michael] Walton tried very hard to get him to change his mind.&#13;
We even had a session in Trinity College, Cambridge, where Amartya Sen was the Master, to try&#13;
to get Ravi to change his mind, and, well, we didn't succeed.&#13;
&#13;
So my first task, even before I was formally appointed, was to--&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Was to deal with the--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Try to rescue it, yes. I think it was quite a good report, as it turned out.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Actually, I felt so too, but--I have a lot to ask you about the report. Let me just back&#13;
up for one second or two here.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: But much of that was before I joined.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, right.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: In those four months when I was appointed and was coming three or four days a&#13;
month.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, right. And the work had already been done.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It was like three or four days.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Days, right, a month.&#13;
&#13;
When Jim Wolfensohn offered you the job, did he lay out goals for you as the Chief Economist?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: No.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Obviously you knew what the job entailed.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I knew quite a lot about the job because when you work in development you know a&#13;
lot about the Bank, and of course Iâ&#128;&#153;d been interacting with the Bank for six years as Chief&#13;
Economist at the EBRD, so I knew quite a lot about the Bank, and I was very close to Joe, and&#13;
had been very close to Michael Bruno and Stan [Stanley] Fischer, a good friend of Larry&#13;
Summers actually right through. I didn't know Anne Krueger so well. I knew her, of course, but&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
each of the previous Chief Economists had been a good friend, not just a friend, each of them,&#13;
Stan, Larry, Michael and Joe, so I used to talk to them quite a bit anyway.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, coming into an institution where you really know a lot about the institution&#13;
and you know the people who had the job before. What kind of an agenda did you set for&#13;
yourself?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I wanted to get growth very clearly, growth and trade very clearly back on the agenda.&#13;
And I wanted to--it seemed to me extraordinary that they had slipped away from the center of the&#13;
agenda, but I think they probably had. That was, for example, embodied in the WDR [World&#13;
Development Report] of 2000 on poverty, and one of the things that I did which didnâ&#128;&#153;t change&#13;
the content but I think it was important symbolically and in terms of a sense of direction, if you&#13;
remember, was to reverse the order of sections of that report. And the report had been written as&#13;
empowerment, opportunity, security as the key topics, in that order, and I just reversed the order&#13;
and made it opportunity, empowerment and security. Some people thought that this was&#13;
somehow devaluing the report or taking away its main thrust. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t think so because the&#13;
concepts were all there and all strong.&#13;
&#13;
But it made quite a difference to the way in which Larry Summers, for example--it made quite a&#13;
difference to the way in which people saw, including Larry--I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to make it especially&#13;
about Larry. It was more than Larry. It made a difference in the way in which some people saw&#13;
the story, and putting opportunity first fitted with the kind of entrepreneurial experience that I&#13;
had right back to â&#128;&#153;69 in Kenya, so I was going back more than 20 years in terms of my own&#13;
experience. So I think that made quite a big difference to the report in the acceptability and the&#13;
understanding of the report without losing the empowerment story, which I think is hugely&#13;
important.&#13;
&#13;
The problem was that by putting empowerment first, people thought you were abandoning the&#13;
growth story, whereas if you bring empowerment to the growth story itâ&#128;&#153;s much easier to bring&#13;
people with you. So in terms of exposition and persuasion itâ&#128;&#153;s much easier to do it that way&#13;
around. So that was kind of parentheses in my answer to the question about what my agenda&#13;
was, because in a sense I was already manifesting it even before I had come on board with the&#13;
way in which we re-jigged the WDR.&#13;
&#13;
So I wanted to get growth and trade very strongly on the agenda, and I think many people felt,&#13;
probably with some justification, although not total, that in the enthusiasm and emphasis for&#13;
poverty reduction, which I share totally as an objective, the growth story has been marginalized&#13;
which obviously is a mistake, and I think people exaggerated to the extent to which that&#13;
happened, but I think there was an extent to which it happened and I wanted to turn that around.&#13;
&#13;
So growth and trade. And within that story I wanted to make the institutional environment for&#13;
entrepreneurial activity a key part of the growth story, which is still relatively new to economists.&#13;
It was very institutional, behavioral, and some of them thought it wooly. So I wanted to show&#13;
that you can be actually as rigorous and clear in this area as you were in other areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Nicholas Stern&#13;
                               April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: There was around the same time that you came in I think--wasnâ&#128;&#153;t there a change at&#13;
the International Finance Corporation? Is that when Peter--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Peter Woicke, he was already there.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: He was already there, okay.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: But he was newish, he was newish, but he was already there.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Did you work with him because--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: There was some kind of a bank-wide group, was there, or to work on private sector&#13;
or--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, the--I mean the IFC was--obviously invests in the private sector and the Bank&#13;
invests in the public sector. But this notion of the public sector creating the environment for&#13;
private sector investment clearly bridges those areas. So I did actually change perspectives in a&#13;
way that Peter was very supportive to, and so we got on well from that point of view.&#13;
&#13;
There were other things that came more strongly onto the agenda and thatâ&#128;&#153;s the empowerment&#13;
story. I was always sympathetic to it, but I became more enthusiastic about it as time went by.&#13;
My book on development has just been published by MIT Press, so itâ&#128;&#153;s coming out in about two&#13;
weeks time. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve already got a hard copy. Itâ&#128;&#153;s called Growth and Empowerment. And I wrote,&#13;
started writing that in 2002. I was awarded a prize by Munich University, which is a quite&#13;
prestigious thing when you go and give three lectures, and then they turn those lectures into a&#13;
book published by MIT Press--not they do--you do. So it took quite a long time to turn those&#13;
lectures into the book, but itâ&#128;&#153;s just been published. I finished it actually and finally delivered it to&#13;
the press just over a year ago, so it was finally done after I left, but basically the work was done&#13;
before I left.&#13;
&#13;
I collaborated with two guys who were in my unit, Jean-Jacques Dethier and F. Halsey Rogers.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Let me ask another question about the position itself. This is a very large&#13;
administrative position, isnâ&#128;&#153;t it? I mean, how many people are in the Chief Economistâ&#128;&#153;s Office?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: 250, 300, something like that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Was that an issue for you? I mean, you managed a staff of 17 you said and--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yes. I was on the Executive Committee of the EBRD, running the whole thing. So I&#13;
was used to taking decisions affecting in the whole Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Nicholas Stern&#13;
                                April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What I was getting at is that--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Plus a Governor of the LSE. I ran LSEâ&#128;&#153;s biggest research center. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been managing&#13;
groups pretty much my whole life really.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Again, as an academic and someone whoâ&#128;&#153;s done some administration, and concluded&#13;
I would rather study it than do it, the question is how much time--obviously the job is important&#13;
intellectually, but what Iâ&#128;&#153;m trying to get to, more or less for the record, is how much time did you&#13;
have to spend on administrative matters as part of the routine working of the office?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Quite a lot. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know if I can really give you a time budget, but my guess is that it&#13;
may have been a third of my time. But what I really saw as my main task was to bring the&#13;
economic analysis to the center of Bank decision making so that people would look to what the&#13;
research group could provide, and see us as part of the whole strategy in the decision making&#13;
process of the Bank. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what I had been used to at EBRD, and I saw that as something&#13;
special that intellectually-oriented social scientists could offer to the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Because, you know, I could have stayed if I wanted to just write books Iâ&#128;&#153;d have stayed at LSE,&#13;
and what weâ&#128;&#153;re trying to do is to shape policy and action in a very important development&#13;
institution. Now partly you do that by writing your books in a way, and your articles, within the&#13;
institution that focused on what the institution was doing, you give ideas. But partly you do that&#13;
by getting directly involved in the formulation of strategy and in the decision making on country&#13;
strategies and projects and programs, and thatâ&#128;&#153;s what I saw as a big priority and which probably&#13;
Joe had not seen as a big priority.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That was one of the reasons I asked this, if you draw some kind of a contrast, I&#13;
guess, going back to Anne Krueger. She became very much involved, as I understand it--I never&#13;
interviewed her--both within the Bank and outside of the Bank in promoting the ideas that she&#13;
was trying to develop within the Bank. And my sense of people who looked at this is that&#13;
Stiglitz did not, although Stiglitz was a high-powered intellectual, that he wasnâ&#128;&#153;t making his&#13;
cases totally within the Bank and perhaps outside the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Joe had a pretty high profile outside.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: He traveled a lot, and he was always giving talks on the road, interviews on the road. I&#13;
think Joe didnâ&#128;&#153;t devote so much time to making things happen within the Bank, and I had had six&#13;
years of experience doing that at the EBRD, so it just came rather naturally to me as an obvious,&#13;
the crucial part of my remit or what I should define as my own remit.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay, good.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I wrote a job description for Jim a few months after getting there. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure how&#13;
much he focused on it, but it essentially described what I was doing.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And he approved, so--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yeah, he was fine.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You got to the Bank in the midst of a series of crises, with Kanbur quitting, and I&#13;
want to just mention very briefly this row that developed over your appointment with the Staff&#13;
Association.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yeah. It was quite a row.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What happened there, and more importantly, what was your reaction to it? It must&#13;
have been, obviously, quite a surprise.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, I knew all about the issue because my ability to be a consultant to the Bank was&#13;
very heavily circumscribed by the consanguinity rules that they had. Long ago, in the â&#128;&#153;70s, I did&#13;
some consultancy at the Bank and that could only be sanctioned by some special internal&#13;
mechanism, which would scrutinize and clear, show that there was no connection.&#13;
&#13;
But later, in the â&#128;&#153;80s, people became still more sensitive and there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t even any mechanism&#13;
for scrutinizing and clearing.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t done.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: So I knew all about the story, that I was selected by a committee of people for whom I&#13;
had great respect, the best, Stiglitz and Sen, the best academics in development in the business.&#13;
And Jeff Goldstein was there, you know, from the administration side, so the process that&#13;
selected me was entirely comprehensible, but I had been considered very seriously in the past&#13;
also, so I assumed that it was possible. I was not an expert on the constitution of the Bank, and it&#13;
was indeed possible, because Jim gotâ&#128;&#148;as I had found out later--Jim got the advice from his&#13;
general counsel that this is a rule that he can override in the best interest of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
And he was advised by a committee of experts that he had set up that I was the best candidate,&#13;
and he therefore decided to overrule it. I know that the three people on the committee&#13;
individually, each of them, thought it would be absurd to exclude me on what looked like an&#13;
arbitrary happenstance, the happenstance being my brother happened to be there. They had that&#13;
view as individuals that the formal position was very clear, that Jim was allowed to override the&#13;
rule, and told the Board that that's what he was doing.&#13;
&#13;
So the whole thing was very transparent, transparent in the process of selection, which I knew&#13;
something about because of the interview. And it was transparent, as I learned--though I wasn't&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
there--in terms of the advice that Jim got and what he told the board. So I felt perfectly&#13;
comfortable with the selection process.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, the row--oh, Iâ&#128;&#153;m sorry.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Then of course the Staff Association, who had difficulties of a number of kinds with&#13;
Jim with various reforms that were taking place including in pensions and so on, they chose to&#13;
make that an issue of principle with Jim. And it was very difficult for my brother Richard and&#13;
myself. We are very close, I mean, and brothers should be. So there was never a problem&#13;
between us because we knew and trusted each other and we knew that we had been brought up&#13;
with high ethical standards which we believed weâ&#128;&#153;d acquired and practiced in our own lives. So&#13;
we didnâ&#128;&#153;t actually have any problems with the decision or how it came about. We had no reason&#13;
to be embarrassed in any way.&#13;
&#13;
So we decided--we talked a lot about it, obviously, on the phone and in person. Our view was&#13;
that there was only one thing we could do, which was just ride it through, because we had no&#13;
conception of having done anything that was--Richard had done nothing, and all I had done was&#13;
be interviewed. So what could we possibly have done to have been reprehensible in any way.&#13;
Quite the opposite. So we decided that there was nothing we could do, that we'd just ride it out,&#13;
which is what we did do. It wasn't pleasant.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. I would imagine it wasn't pleasant. One question that I have--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: And Jim, to his credit, toughed it out. I was very grateful to him for doing that. But&#13;
he didn't know--he knew he had a bit of a problem. He didn't know, I'm sure, about the extent&#13;
the problem turned out to be.&#13;
&#13;
But it went away. It wasn't terribly long. And by the time I got there, this appointment was&#13;
March I think or February, February the appointment was announced. By the time I got there in&#13;
July I didn't feel anything personally.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That was really what I was also getting at, is did--was there any legacy of this or&#13;
lingering--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Really not.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: --that complicated your job. That's basically what I was getting at.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Not at all. By the time I had arrived, I in large measure had saved the WDR. People&#13;
knew about me. Most people knew about me anyway. I mean, I was somebody of some&#13;
substance. And I had great support in my own department.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That was one of the other questions I--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Actually, by the time I got there in July, it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t an issue, at least not for me&#13;
personally, so I felt very comfortable. It was just two difficult months of barrages of criticism of&#13;
Jim, there was never any criticism of me.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve read through all of this and it focused--the newsletters that I read of the&#13;
Bank's newsletter always seemed to be focused on the issue and I never found anything that&#13;
questioned your qualifications or anything, just the issue of roles.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: And nobody rang me up and said, you know, "You bastard. You shouldn't be here."&#13;
Nobody, nobody.&#13;
&#13;
And my first week I went and joined the Staff Association. It was quite funny actually. It was in&#13;
the first week and I just wandered in on my own, with no assistance, I just went in. And I said I&#13;
had just arrived at the Bank and I want to join the Staff Association. And I asked to speak to the&#13;
Chair, I hadnâ&#128;&#153;t made an appointment--I just wandered in--and actually she was quite a nice lady.&#13;
What was her name?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: George.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Morallina George. By that time, of course, I was well aware of what her name was.&#13;
So I said, "If I could just say hello to Morallina George." So they said, "Well, what's your&#13;
name?" So I said, "It's Nick Stern." "Just one moment." And scurried off, and Morallina said,&#13;
"Welcome to the Staff Association and thank you for joining," and I got my--here's my gym bag.&#13;
See that blue bag?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That's your Staff Association bag.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yeah, I got that and in my first weekâ&#128;&#148;so it was fine. By the time I got there, I really,&#13;
really didn't feel any problem.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: My only--my interest really in this is not to rehash the story, but in everything I've&#13;
read about it, no one ever said what effect it really had on you in the Bank. [Unclear] aside from&#13;
the unpleasantness of being publicly part of a kind of a major campaign [unclear].&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It was unpleasant before I got there. I can't say that I enjoyed it, quite obviously,&#13;
because I didn't like it.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: But, as I said, in reflecting on what either Richard or I could do, the answer was&#13;
absolutely nothing, so that's exactly what we did.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: We've interviewed your brother. I've interviewed your brother.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Nicholas Stern&#13;
                               April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, you can see why weâ&#128;&#153;re so close. He's a great bloke.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. He really is. I enjoyed the interviews enormously. Now, he left the Bank to-&#13;
-he's working with--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: He left the Bank in around January after I got there, after about 6 months.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: One question I wanted to ask before moving on to developing strategies within the&#13;
Bank. There had been an awful lot of criticism of the--more of the IMF I guess than the Bank--&#13;
about the kind of data that was collected before the Asian financial crisis. I know that Stiglitz&#13;
was interested in that. Was that still an issue when you took up the post?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Not that one. For me data have always been a big issue, and the quality of&#13;
information, and I collected primary data myself. As an historian youâ&#128;&#153;ll appreciate the&#13;
implications of that. And I was very keen on primary data, and people knowing their dataâ&#128;&#148;and&#13;
one thing I did, and you might want to talk to Shaida Baidee, who's head of the data side in the&#13;
vice presidency I was running. She's very good. And I felt very much that one of the things the&#13;
Bank could and should do was to invest more in data because comparative data is something&#13;
where the Bank has a very strong comparative advantage, and it's also very difficult, very&#13;
difficult.&#13;
&#13;
And I thought that this was a big investment that the Bank should be makingâ&#128;&#148;sorry, the Bank&#13;
should be making a bigger investment on that side. And this came from long experience of&#13;
collecting primary data, working as a development economist myself. But it also came with a&#13;
big emphasis on a number of shareholders, particularly the United States, on results. So it was a&#13;
good moment for investing in data--&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Were you able to--&#13;
&#13;
STERN: One of the things I did was to really boost the data budget. My first year I went to the&#13;
research budget, and we really increased the research budget very strongly, which had been&#13;
squeezed, and you know, really that was one of the things that Joe didn't concentrate on and it&#13;
just got squeezed. So I really increased the research in the budget in the first year. That was a&#13;
very important part of that story. But after that I was really focused on the data side, to increase&#13;
the data story, investment in data, and we did do that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: When you say--so it's not only data collection in your part of the Bank but just more&#13;
broadly within the Bank? Could the Bank itself do a better job of that?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It was both. In my area it was really, you know, getting the basic data sets in place.&#13;
But in the Bank as a whole, it was really trying to get people to put together data sets on&#13;
programs and projects, which would allow explicit learning, which would allow you to measure&#13;
the results from your own activities better. You have to get baseline data, obviously, to be able&#13;
to do that. And you had to push people to show what their lessons were.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                               April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So my argument was that the Bank is small relative to the development issue, that, for example,&#13;
the Bank was lending about $15 billion a year, whereas investment in developing countries was&#13;
about a hundred times that, one and a half trillion. It would--similar things would be true, you&#13;
know, the Bank would be lending one or two billion for education, whereas education spending&#13;
in developing countries would be more than a hundred times that.&#13;
&#13;
I had a kind of one percent rule that most places you look, the Bank does around one percent. On&#13;
average, more in Africa, a high percentage, less in India and China, relative to that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. Well, they generate their own capital.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yeah. But the Bank was around one percent of the story. So we had to see ourselves&#13;
as an ideas bank, not simply in terms of research ideas, but in terms of ideas about what works&#13;
and what doesnâ&#128;&#153;t work. I was very much with Jim, and weâ&#128;&#153;d been hatching this for a while, on&#13;
the whole idea of scaling up. So the idea that it was our job to identify and demonstrate things&#13;
that worked, and then try to get those scaled up. But we couldn't do scaling up ourselves. We&#13;
couldn't build all the bridges or dams or wherever it is you're talking about.&#13;
&#13;
But what we could do is to show what could work and then be convincing about that, understand&#13;
why it worked, so that you could take those ideas forward. So evidence is very important there,&#13;
not just in the project, but getting the evidence to show there's a lesson here which other people&#13;
can apply.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What about the Bank's--did you work with the people, the Bank's self-evaluation&#13;
unit?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: OED [Operations Evaluation Department]?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yes, a little bit. Greg Ingram, actually, I had a good personal relationship as a&#13;
researcher over many, many years. I did talk to Greg quite a lot. But my feeling was that the&#13;
Operations Evaluation Department was a different kind of animal, that they were essentially&#13;
looking at accountability way after the event, and they were looking at lessons learned way after&#13;
the event.&#13;
&#13;
And what we needed more was learning on projects as you go, because, you know, you're going&#13;
to have to translate lessons into ideas quickly in a year, two, three years before you can know the&#13;
full results of the project. So you've got to get used to a different kind of learning. It's difficult,&#13;
occasionally a bit more iffy, but the pace, the movement was such that you couldn't wait until the&#13;
project was finished and then go on to an evaluation. We were about learning and not so much&#13;
about accountability. Well, it's an important issue, but OED did that more.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. Well, a major criticism of OED always is that it takes too long to come up&#13;
with the conclusions that it comes up with.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Greg was always sympathetic to that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Are we okay with time?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I think weâ&#128;&#153;re probably not.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to go over whatâ&#128;&#153;s been scheduled.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Good morning. Today is April 16th, and Iâ&#128;&#153;m here with Nicholas Stern in&#13;
Washington to continue the conversation that we began in London about 10 days ago.&#13;
&#13;
Itâ&#128;&#153;s good to see you again. Good morning.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Good morning.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: At the end of our last interview we were discussing how even before you officially&#13;
took up your duties you took a strong hand in rearranging the presentation of the 2000 World&#13;
Development Report [WDR]. To begin, how did you change the emphasis in the draft of what&#13;
turned out to be a controversial report?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Actually, it turned out to be less controversial than weâ&#128;&#153;d anticipated. But the&#13;
production process was controversial. The production process had been very consultative, so&#13;
very early drafts were put on the web. There were mountains of commentaries on them. So the&#13;
writing team had put themselves under enormous pressure, sort of writing in a goldfish bowl,&#13;
with everybody putting in their own ideas in a very detailed way on very early drafts, and on a&#13;
scale where I think it was quite difficult for them to cope with.&#13;
&#13;
It was also a report that was receiving a lot of pressure from different governments. It was&#13;
getting lots of comments, thousands of them from NGOs [non-governmental organizations] and&#13;
interested parties, but also commentaries from governments. And there was a concern, I think,&#13;
particularly with the US government that the structure that it had which was essentially starting&#13;
with the ideas of empowerment and then going on to opportunity and security, that that structure&#13;
would turn the audience naturally, and indeed the argument naturally away from the importance&#13;
of growth in combating poverty.&#13;
&#13;
And I think the US felt that that would be a very poor outcome for the World Bank in the sense&#13;
that it would divert attention to what it saw as a political concept of empowerment and away&#13;
from economic growth, and it felt, I think, that the Bank had already gone too far in that&#13;
direction, so there was a background.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I had--when I arrived in March, from March, April, May, June, I was due to be there four or five&#13;
days a month--I canâ&#128;&#153;t remember exactly when it was that Ravi Kanbur resigned as theâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I think it was in June.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: --director, but I was becoming involved before he resigned, and my own view was that&#13;
the basic trio of empowerment, opportunity and security was actually quite a good way to look at&#13;
poverty, and a way which came through in poor people's assessment of their own poverty, came&#13;
through very strongly. There was a good sort of, rather extensive survey, I think it was 60,000&#13;
people in 60 countries called "Voices of the Poor," edited by Deepa Narayan. And those ideas&#13;
came through quite strongly when one tried to crystallize what one was hearing.&#13;
&#13;
So the basic trio of ideas I thought was good, but I shared some of the reservations of those who&#13;
felt that the World Bank had left growth too much on the sidelines. There was always a little&#13;
nodding in that direction, if one argued that growth was important for poverty reduction. But&#13;
then it was left--after nodding, it was left peripheral. So I thought there was actually quite an&#13;
easy way through this one, which would retain the integrity of the trio of ideas, but would just&#13;
readjust the emphasis, and that was to switch opportunity, empowerment. So I suggested, really&#13;
insisted, that we should switch opportunity, empowerment and security, and that is exactly what&#13;
we did do, and it worked, I think, in terms of a good report, quite well.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the pressures on Ravi were quite difficult to analyze. He felt that he'd very deliberately&#13;
gone out and tried to be consultative, that he felt he had got quite a lot of positive feedback on&#13;
the way he was doing it, although obviously there was I think several thousand comments. I&#13;
don't remember how many there were now. You know, you get very different strands. But he&#13;
felt that basically there was some support out there, that he was being hailed as someone who&#13;
was taking the Bank away from--correctly taking the Bank away from -- all this growth stuff.&#13;
&#13;
So he felt quite exposed, given the way he'd opened it all up to consultation, and the pressures on&#13;
him started to build up. He didn't look very well. He looked thin, with bags under his eyes, and&#13;
his wife was, Maggie was very closely involved, not only in the welfare of Ravi, but also in the&#13;
substance and the detail of the various arguments. So I think there was some pressure building&#13;
up in that direction too. Again, all of this was understandable, and nothing there was wrong or&#13;
improper in any way, but the pressures are building up on him. And at some point, this was back&#13;
in June, he resigned.&#13;
&#13;
We thought he might, because obviously it was going through his mind. And then at some time,&#13;
must have been in June, Mike [Michael] Walton, who had been involved and had done WDRs&#13;
before, was a great friend of all of us, is a great friend of all of us, and Amartya Sen and myself--&#13;
I think Tony Atkinson might have been there as well--we all met up in Trinity College,&#13;
Cambridge, where Amartya Sen was adviser, where Amartya Sen was master, and Amartya had&#13;
been an adviser to the WDR, and we were all good personal friends as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Nicholas Stern&#13;
                               April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So we tried to spend a day, I think it was--I canâ&#128;&#153;t remember exactly how long--in Trinity. We&#13;
asked spouses to come along, so it was very deliberately a relaxed event, amongst friends, as&#13;
well as an event of substance on the WDR.&#13;
&#13;
And we talked it all through with Ravi. He had been a student of mine, as a graduate student, so&#13;
we all knew each other well and liked each other, and still do, but we didnâ&#128;&#153;t resolve it, and Ravi&#13;
decided to stay with his decision to resign.&#13;
&#13;
And then a very nice Latin American lady, whose name is slipping my mind at the moment--as a&#13;
matter of fact, who she was, she was the deputy. Nora, Nora--it was Nora [Lustig], but it will&#13;
come back in a moment.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: She had been everybodyâ&#128;&#153;s deputy, and she stepped up, well and strongly into the new&#13;
situation. And we basically, just by flipping that order, handled the whole thing in a way that&#13;
worked, because you got opportunity, empowerment, security, opportunity, a much broader&#13;
concept than growth, but encapsulates the growth story.&#13;
&#13;
And I--you know, with the team pulling together very well. Nobody else left. It was just Ravi&#13;
who resigned. And Mike Walton stayed involved. He wasnâ&#128;&#153;t full time or anything, but he put a&#13;
lot of time into the advisory role. Amartya Sen stayed close, and I stayed very close, and I took&#13;
more time on it, I think, than a Chief Economist would normally.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, I think I know the answer to this, but did you see this report as a blueprint for&#13;
your approach to development, or were there elements that were left out, and if so, what?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It was a set of ideas, which was not a blueprint, my own approach, but close in spirit,&#13;
close enough I felt very comfortable with it. So that when I started to make my own ideas more&#13;
concrete over the following year or so, I felt there was a natural flow and consistency, and it&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#153;t a hard wrench away from something that had been set in the opposite direction. It was&#13;
something that flowed quite naturally.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, did you have--Iâ&#128;&#153;m just not sure how much influence the Chief Economist has&#13;
in setting the topics for the WDR, because the next one was on Building Institutions for Markets.&#13;
Was that your idea basically?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: No. The Chief Economist does have almost complete control over the ideas, but&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#153;s a production lag. So Building Institutions for Markets was Joe Stiglitzâ&#128;&#153;s launch. So when&#13;
I came that team was already working.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: And already existed. So unless I was going to cancel something, which was well&#13;
under way, and so it would be very disruptive and make it very difficult in the time available to&#13;
produce a report, so you basically have to go along with that. So the reports that people do have-&#13;
-you start as a Chief Economist if youâ&#128;&#153;ve got a three- or four-year cycle with one or one-and-a-&#13;
half reports that youâ&#128;&#153;ve inherited. So I inherited Attacking Poverty and Building Institutions for&#13;
Markets.&#13;
&#13;
But I also--in this case it was somewhat unusual--inherited something more. I inherited the&#13;
sustainable development [Sustainable Development in a Dynamic World] one as well, because&#13;
that was--that subject was very heavily constrained by the approach of the August/September&#13;
2002 meeting. World Summit on Sustainable Development was in South Africa in&#13;
August/September 2002. So it was a very powerful case for making sustainable development the&#13;
keynote topic for that WDR, and let us get it out a little earlier so that it could influence that&#13;
meeting.&#13;
&#13;
So in a sense I started with the poverty one, where I was very closely involved. I inherited two, I&#13;
inherited two, one of which was already under way and one which had a very powerful reason&#13;
for being in existence, which I accepted. And so I got--the intellectual direction of those two&#13;
was with me. So I had to get very closely involved in subjects which I was quite enthusiastic&#13;
about, but would not have been my natural choice, andâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Even the institutions? I mean your interest and your approach has looked at the&#13;
institutionalâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It is, but I would have probably set it more broadly than just institutions for market.&#13;
But I think it worked out fine, and I was very comfortable, and I was quite closely involved.&#13;
&#13;
The ones I did choose in a completely unconstrained way for myself were Making Services&#13;
Work for Poor People and A Better Investment Climate for Everyone.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: So I ended up, even though I was there for three-and-a-half years, I ended up actually&#13;
doing five WDRs, the first one, which was the poverty one, which I was very intensely involved&#13;
with, although I came at a late stage. The other, the next two I sort of inherited but took all the&#13;
way, nearly all the way through. The first one was Building Institutions for Markets, was&#13;
already in the cooker, but in the early days. And then these last two. One of them was published&#13;
just as I left, and then the other one, you know, was inherited by Francois Bourguignon, just the&#13;
same way I had inherited things.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, right. Is the--the one on institutions in particular, was that controversial&#13;
within the Bank? Stiglitz was controversial in the Bank, I would think, especially with his rather&#13;
public criticism of the so-called Washington Consensus.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So I mean did you have to deal with that kind of resistance?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: No. Building Institutions for Markets was not particularly controversial. In fact it&#13;
was--to the extent that it had any controversy, which was not huge, it was actually rather un-&#13;
Stiglitzian, because the Building Institutions for Markets, some people chastised the Bank for&#13;
being too market oriented and not focused enough on poverty by having something with that&#13;
title.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: So in a sense had Joeâ&#128;&#153;s career at the Bank lasted right through the publication of that,&#13;
he would have possibly come in for criticism from those who thought he was their champion.&#13;
But it would have been wrong in my view, and that criticism is not particularly heavy, and--so it&#13;
was not a wildly uncontroversial thing, and it had the misfortune to be published on September&#13;
the 11th, 2001.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I didn't know that.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: And it was quite extraordinary actually. The leader in The Washington Post (might&#13;
have been the Financial Times) the next day, the first leader--and you can check this, but my&#13;
memory is that the first leader on September 12th was on, of course, the terrible events with the&#13;
aircraft crashes, and the second leader was on the World Development Report. I just found that a&#13;
sort of strange juxtaposition.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That was probably the early editions. The later editions probably moved it back a&#13;
little bit in the paper, butâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
STERN: But it was a leader. You know, obviously, I don't know if there was any particular&#13;
news coverage, but it was leader, that is, the comment page.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. Oh, I see, okay.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I didn't mean the front page. We call it in the UK the leader. The leader is the--if you&#13;
look at the FT, the leader is usually on the page which is not the--you've got the back page, but&#13;
behind the back page, then you go in one, and it's on the left-hand side in the FT. That's what we&#13;
call the leader. It's that commentaryâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. It's the editorial page usually.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Editorial page. So it was the second item on the editorial page.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see, I see.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: The first item of courseâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Was what happened.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Being the crashes. It meant that its profile was much more limited than perhaps it&#13;
might otherwise have been.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. In this third report, that again, was in train as you arrived, the one on&#13;
sustainable development.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It hadn't actually started, but the notion that that was the right subject was fairly firmly&#13;
there.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In working on that, did you have to work with NGOs? It seemed to me that that's an&#13;
issue that the NGOs were quite interested in.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yeah, there was a lot of consultation. It hadn't begun, so I chose Zmarak Shalizi as the&#13;
editor of that, whereas I had not chosen Roumeen Islam, the previous editor, because that team&#13;
was already in existence, already working before I got there. But I was there, of course before&#13;
the beginning of the sustainable development. And it actually was very consultative. They did&#13;
talk a lot to different NGOs, but I think it was--which meant it was heavier work because you&#13;
had to do more interacting relative to writing, and you couldn't reduce the writing, so you just did&#13;
more. So it was very heavy work. But I think it--I don't recall it being hugely difficult.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. In the years that you were at the Bank, there was, as there continues to be, a&#13;
great deal of criticism and enmity towards the Bank. Were you surprised by that?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Not really, because, you know, I had been close to the Bank, as most people in&#13;
development economics are, so there was nothing there that was at all surprising. I was struck&#13;
by the intensity of Prague, at the Annual Meetings in Prague, where there was quite a bit of&#13;
destruction. But even so, you know, we continued and got on with the job, and--I don't think I&#13;
missed any appointments or anything, and it wasn't that disruptive. So it was striking rather than&#13;
surprising. But it probably, in retrospect, peaked in Prague. I've forgotten when the Annual&#13;
Meetings in Prague were. I think it was the September of 2000.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: September 2000, and in retrospect, it probably peaked there, because the Annual&#13;
Meetings were always the target. You had September the 11th, 2001, which resulted in the&#13;
moving and postponement and the whittling down of the Annual Meetings, which took place in&#13;
the end in Canada, in November, on a very small scale. So I think in retrospect, Prague was the&#13;
peak, and nothing much happened, because there wasn't much of a target the following year, and&#13;
September the 11th had happened. And by the time you wound through to the next year, which&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
was September 2002 back in Washington, I remember it being very modest. There were a few&#13;
things, but not much.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, it became clear there were other evils in the world, in quotes.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: So in retrospect I think Prague was the peak of that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I wanted to turn to your own thinking about development and the imprint that you&#13;
put on the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s thinking about development, with your emphasis on the investment climate and&#13;
empowering the poor.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Empowering and investing in poor people.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, okay.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I tried to--I mean you could include investing in poor people within empowerment, but&#13;
I thought--which I didnâ&#128;&#153;t always use the language--but I thought it helped actually to be explicit.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. These ideas had started to develop before you became to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You said that, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yeah. The investment climate story developed very much in the European Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development, where they were quite explicitly central in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s charter,&#13;
or articles of association, or whatever it was called, which was all about Article I, I seem to&#13;
rememberâ&#128;&#148;I can't rehearse the exact language after all these years, but it was the purpose of the&#13;
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was to foster the development of the&#13;
market economy, entrepreneurship and so on.&#13;
&#13;
So you quite explicitly have to ask yourself a fairly fundamental question about what a market&#13;
economy meant, because you were trying to help foster the transition from a command economy&#13;
to a market economy. Where was it you were trying to go? What was involved in building it?&#13;
So at EBRD those questions are absolutely dead center, unavoidable, and that's where we started&#13;
to build up ideas of what the investment climate meant, and the series of transition reports, which&#13;
I started at the EBRD, so I could take on those questions in an explicit contextual, quantitative&#13;
way.&#13;
&#13;
And I had been involved, of course, in development way, way before involvement in--&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: --the transition story. And it was pretty clear to me from the beginning that these ideas&#13;
were fundamental in development more generally and not just the transition story.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, how current were those, or common were those ideas among development&#13;
economists and practitioners?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: They were present, but I think itâ&#128;&#153;s fair to say they were not prominent. And the World&#13;
Bank, again, because they were involved in the whole transition story, were using those ideas,&#13;
but not prominently. I think itâ&#128;&#153;s fair to say it was because I had been thinking about it for a long&#13;
time before I came, those six years as Chief Economist of the EBRD.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Then I really sort of launched them and made them more structured and central.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, how does the Chief Economist get his or his officeâ&#128;&#153;s views of development or&#13;
these ideas diffused within the Bank, within the community of development specialists, and&#13;
among practitioners in developing countries?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Speeches that get circulated and published is one way. Talking to your own troops,&#13;
because they spread out, is another way. Talking to the Board is another way. Giving seminars&#13;
at academic institutions. I used to try not to give seminars in the United States, on the grounds&#13;
that it's the Chief Economist of the World Bank. The United States used to get too much&#13;
attention anyway. You've got all your friends, particularly in the East Coast universities, so I&#13;
tried to resist the temptation to speak to them and tried to give my talks, as far as I could, in&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
And that way you got out not only to the economists in developing countries, but you got out to&#13;
the economists in the field in the World Bank which I think is an important way of diffusing&#13;
ideas.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How important to this process is the ABCDE [Annual Bank Conference on&#13;
Development Economics]?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Modestly in my view. By the time I got there I thought it was getting a bit sclerotic. I&#13;
think itâ&#128;&#153;d been going a dozen years or so, can't remember, ten, eleven, a dozen years before I&#13;
came, and it was always in Washington. The one thing that I institutedâ&#128;&#148;and we had the first of&#13;
these, thereâ&#128;&#153;s always a gestation period--is that we had one of these in Bangalore, in India, in I&#13;
think March or April of 2000. So that was the first ABCDE outside Washington.&#13;
&#13;
And the idea, which has been continued by Francois Bourguignon, my successor, was to have&#13;
one in Washington and the next one in the field, so we had one I think in January or February&#13;
this year in Senegal. So that idea of one year in Washington, one year out, has continued, and I&#13;
think it does actually take--when I take it to a different continent each time, so I think that's a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Nicholas Stern&#13;
                               April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
way of sort of taking ideas out and lighting up a bit, because if you have the ABCDE in Africa or&#13;
India or Latin America, then naturally you pick up the ideas that are particularly relevant to that&#13;
continent, an easy way. So that was the main change I had in the ABCDE.&#13;
&#13;
I did have one difficulty, which was tough for me in one of the ABCDEs, this one in&#13;
Washington. I canâ&#128;&#153;t remember which year it was. Probably 2002, where we invited Alan&#13;
Krueger of Princeton University to talk on--he was doing some work on who terrorists were, and&#13;
whether to try to examine this idea of the relationship between terrorism and poverty. And he&#13;
had quite a lot of data. He was arguing that terrorists weren't actually poor people, or necessarily&#13;
operating for causes which were clearly identifiable as causes related to poverty, as opposed to&#13;
causes related to some critical grievance, which wasn't immediately poverty, however you might&#13;
try to argue there was an ultimate link.&#13;
&#13;
And he used a lot of data on Arab and Muslim terrorists, and it caused a real furor in the--among&#13;
some of the Arab and Muslim members of the board of the Bank. And he, I felt, had done, you&#13;
know, a reasonable study and was opening up a question which was important. He was probably&#13;
a bit incautious in some of his language, but I wouldn't put it more strongly than that, but in a&#13;
way where those reading it from a particular position felt that he hadn't recognized terrorists as&#13;
freedom fighters in some environments. He was looking at data, I think related to what the&#13;
population recognized the terrorists as doing and how they interpreted what terrorists were doing,&#13;
which again they felt risked branding populations. He was obviously going to a difficult political&#13;
area.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: It's still controversial.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Itâ&#128;&#153;s still controversial. My own feeling was that, whilst he's been a bit incautious in&#13;
his language, this didn't amount to anything outrageous. It did amount to probably political&#13;
insensitivity, but some members of the Board demanded that this paper be taken off the agenda.&#13;
&#13;
I was in a very difficult position, because I worked for the Bank. I'm not running an academic&#13;
conference. But this was an academic with great respectability, very decent man and a fine&#13;
academic, who had tried to investigate a subject which seemed to me to be a legitimate subject of&#13;
investigation. But we ran--and it was a period of very, very high tension, and the upshot was it&#13;
was incendiary, so we ended up having to ask him to take it off the--to not present the paper.&#13;
&#13;
My idea was to come back and have a discussion on this kind of thing with his paper and other&#13;
papers in calmer times in a less public way. Alan, quite understandably, was very annoyed about&#13;
this. I would have been in his shoes. And the upshot was that that reconvening on the issue&#13;
never really took place, although I did try to make it happen, but Alan wasn't interested any&#13;
more. He'd had enough of that and I could understand it.&#13;
&#13;
So that was probably the most difficult event associated with ABCDE, but we dealt with it, and&#13;
there was a little bit of publicity in the newspapers, but not very much.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Just moving back a bit, I meant to ask you, in terms of diffusing oneâ&#128;&#153;s ideas,&#13;
obviously, one of the key constituents that one has to deal with is the President. Was [James D.]&#13;
Wolfensohn on the same page? I mean, he had the same views, or did you have to convince&#13;
him?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: You do have to work very closely with the President. I did work very closely with Jim&#13;
Wolfensohn, but heâ&#128;&#153;s a very unusual character, and he feels very much that the ideas that matter&#13;
are his ideas, and he has good ideas.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: So it was very important to stay close to him and share things with him, which I did&#13;
do, and I thought we had a very good working relationship. I regard him now as a friend, and I&#13;
think itâ&#128;&#153;s mutual. So we did establish, I think, quite a close bond, but with Jim, you know, Jim so&#13;
much comes from inside him, you have to actually try to influence the way Jim thinks in a quiet&#13;
way. You canâ&#128;&#153;t just go in and whack down something on the table and say, "Jim, these are my&#13;
ideas. What do you think?" You have to talk it through and establish a close relationship, which&#13;
we did do. And I think we--I was very happy with the way that developed.&#13;
&#13;
But you have to, as it were, take Jim's ideas and try to blend in some of your own thoughts and&#13;
work through some of Jim's speeches. I used to collaborate quite closely with Jim on his Annual&#13;
Meeting speeches. So, it was that kind of interaction developing over time. The monthly&#13;
meeting called the Corporate Day, which is on a Friday once a month, which Jim instituted,&#13;
where all the Vice Presidents get together, that's quite a good place to share ideas. So over time I&#13;
always tried to go to that, and over time, shared my ideas with the other Vice Presidents, and on&#13;
the whole they reacted very positively.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In our interview a few weeks ago, you said that one of your goals at the Bank was to&#13;
get economic analysis to be at the center of the Bank's decision-making process. How did you&#13;
go about doing that?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I was quite active with the Board, so I tried to help shape what the board would&#13;
expect, and we had these annual meetings with the Board which were residential--stayed&#13;
overnight once a year, where it was a good place to share ideas with the Board, and I used to give&#13;
presentations to the board on various reports, WDRs of course, particularly, and other things as&#13;
well.&#13;
&#13;
So one way of shaping what people offer to the board is to shape what the board expects. And&#13;
I've worked with boards of course for six years at the EBRD, so I had experience with that. So I&#13;
found working with the board fairly natural and a good way to shape what people presenting to&#13;
the board actually present. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s this Corporate Day idea as well. So the vice presidents&#13;
controlling what went to the board and the board with their own expectations, and I interacted&#13;
there on both sides of that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But also I traveled a lot and tried to speak to World Bank people on the ground when I traveled.&#13;
I always have--whenever I traveled I tried to have meetings with the whole resident office. Iâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
just share ideas and impressions, so it was a combination of things.&#13;
&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;d try to keep close personal relations with the regional vice presidents, theyâ&#128;&#153;re very influential&#13;
in the Bank, in some cases by traveling with them. For example, David de Ferranti I traveled a&#13;
fair bit in Latin America with, but also the other regional vice presidents, I always talked to them&#13;
before I went on the road, to share ideas with them.&#13;
&#13;
So it was a matter of looking at the institutional structures like the Corporate Days and the board,&#13;
but also the personal relationships. I did spend a fair bit of time trying to build those&#13;
relationships.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: This is perhaps an unfair question. How successful do you think you were in this&#13;
effort?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It is difficult for me to assess that, but I felt that by the time I left the Bank, the two-&#13;
pillar approach, investing--investment climate, the growth, employment and investment--and the&#13;
empowering, investing in people, were actually seen as what the Bank was doing. If you saw the&#13;
documents that went to the board, virtually all of them of any strategic substance for a country&#13;
would have these ideas very centrally. So I was actually quite happy with the way all this has&#13;
been taken up in the Bank, and largely has stayed there.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Is this an emphasis of your successor?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Francois, a little less so. I mean Francois has two areas heâ&#128;&#153;s particularly interested in&#13;
where heâ&#128;&#153;s worked for years, and very productively worked for years. One is equality and&#13;
equity, and the other is the way in which you use data to draw lessons from about the effects of&#13;
projects. And both those things are very important, and those were areas where Francois is&#13;
focusing, and they're very good and important, heâ&#128;&#153;s done great work.&#13;
&#13;
But my own feeling is that probably those are not areas which of their essence are likely to&#13;
improve the operational and strategic growth of the World Bank in quite the same way, because&#13;
of the kind of subject they are, has nothing to do with the quality, or Francoisâ&#128;&#153;s personality or&#13;
anything, it has to do with the kind of subject they are, and I deliberately wanted to try to shape&#13;
what the Bank was doing, and the strategy of the whole Bank, and the way it looked at&#13;
development, because I felt that these ideas really mattered.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In the time that you were Chief Economist, you obviously did a lot of traveling and&#13;
a lot of speaking. Is there anything else that you want on the record about what you did or what&#13;
was important to you as Chief Economist?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Getting trade very firmly on the Bank's agenda I felt was of crucial importance, and I&#13;
felt that somehow it had slipped away from center stage. There were two things I tried to get&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Nicholas Stern&#13;
                               April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
back strongly on the agenda, growth and trade. And at the same time I tried to develop the&#13;
empowerment story and to make it something natural and concrete, and viewed less skeptically.&#13;
&#13;
So growth, trade and empowerment, I think, were the three areas where I really set out to change&#13;
the way in which the Bank saw them. And I did speak out strongly on trade, and you know, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
got some scars as a result. I criticized rich countriesâ&#128;&#153; policies on trade and protectionism quite&#13;
heavily.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. I want to actually ask you something about that a little later, although we&#13;
don't have that much more time, so it will be soon.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: About 15 minutes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I'll be asking you within 15 minutes that question.&#13;
&#13;
But your name appears on a report that deals with gender as well. Was that something that&#13;
became a really large issue for you?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It did become a large issue for me. I wouldn't claim originality for it in the same way&#13;
that it was deliberately my choice to raise growth, trade and empowerment right up the agenda at&#13;
the Bank. I felt that gender in the Bank was too low, but there were a lot of people there who&#13;
knew more about the issue than I did, who were trying, rightly, I thought, to bring it up the&#13;
agenda, and I supported that with enthusiasm.&#13;
&#13;
But then I was helping other people with a good cause, it seemed to me. And I was particularly&#13;
encouraged by the book Engendering Development by Elizabeth M. King and another chap who&#13;
was very good. I forgot his name now [Andrew D. Mason]. But that book, PRR [Policy&#13;
Research Report], called Policy Research Report on Engendering Development [Engendering&#13;
Development Through Gender Equality in Rights, Resources and Voice], I thought was&#13;
excellent.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You wrote an introduction for that.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yeah. There were real ideas in there about how bringing women much more closely&#13;
into decision making, how that improved the outcomes of practically everything, whether it was&#13;
credit repayment, credit use, governance, farming, practically everything really, certainly&#13;
education and health, that if you brought women closer to the center stage as decision makers,&#13;
that everything works much better. If you simply saw the gender issue in terms of the most&#13;
effective way to do development, you'd have a very powerful argument, notwithstanding the&#13;
deep and important issues of justice and equity, which of course are of fundamental importance&#13;
in their own right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But even if you put--you should not--but even if you put those to one side, youâ&#128;&#153;d still have this&#13;
very powerful case for expanding gender opportunities and involvement, simply on productivity&#13;
grounds. I felt that it was a really first class book that made that case very powerfully, and in a&#13;
way that we were only sort of aware of before, but after reading the book, you knew very&#13;
stronglyâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, right.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: So I was quite activist in that. I enjoyed it and felt it was important. I worked quite&#13;
closely with Elaine Wolfensohn too, who was championing the gender issues at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: The issues have been around, obviously, for a long time.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Absolutely.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: The United Nations, I guess, back in the '80s began the talk about that if not earlier.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Sure. So I hoped I was a real and active--I hoped I was a really active friend who took&#13;
the agenda forward, and Elaine was always very enthusiastic about me as a gender-sensitive&#13;
Chief Economist, which I took as a compliment, and I was very happy about this. But I felt I&#13;
was supporting others who were leading the charge, energetically and cheerfully.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Why did you decide to leave the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It was in large measure going home. We're a very close family. We've got three&#13;
children, and they're all in London, in their 20s. And that was the overwhelming reason, by far&#13;
the strongest reason. There were supporting reasons.&#13;
&#13;
One of them was that Washington had become a less easy place to be after September the 11th,&#13;
and with the particular outlook of the Republican administration, which set different&#13;
atmospherics in the city and the relationship between the Bank and the administration, and so on.&#13;
So it was less comfortable for me. That's very much the minor one.&#13;
&#13;
More important than that, I mean the family issue is the overwhelming one, but more important&#13;
than that one about the feelings about Washington and the atmospherics, was the opportunity in&#13;
the UK It was a unique opportunity to come in at the highest level of the British Civil Service,&#13;
as head of the Government Economic Service, and be close to political decision-making in my&#13;
own country, which comes along, you know, only once, possibly, in a lifetime as the right kind&#13;
of opportunity that fits you, and it came along.&#13;
&#13;
So it was also the opportunity that was unique. So the two big reasons were family and&#13;
opportunity, and the smaller reason was the atmospherics in Washington at the time. But the pull&#13;
in terms of staying was the job. I enjoyed the job enormously, and it was going well, and I was&#13;
&#13;

                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
enjoying myself, and having an effect. So had I not been a Londoner, and an opportunity come&#13;
up in London, I probably would have been quite happy to stay for another couple of years.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, if you had remained at the Bank, what would you have worked on?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I probably would have tried to take the entire--dug more deeply in the empowerment&#13;
story, and Iâ&#128;&#153;d like to have taken the gender story further forward than the way in which--perhaps&#13;
I would go beyond being an enthusiastic supporter, and be something of a leader. But that was&#13;
of course related to the empowerment issue very closely. So I think I would have liked to have&#13;
done more on that.&#13;
&#13;
I would have liked to have got much more involved, still more involved in Africa, and Africa&#13;
was very important to me in that work. I was building up a network of contacts in Africa, and I&#13;
would have liked to have gone still further.&#13;
&#13;
On the more analytical side, I think empowerment and gender, and on the regional side I think Iâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
like to have done much more in Africa, and thirdly, I felt that the Bank was not doing very well&#13;
on rural development, and I would like to have tried to think through how to do it better. I think&#13;
those three things, empowerment including gender, Africa and rural development probably were&#13;
areas where Iâ&#128;&#153;d like to focus more attention.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: One question. I wanted to ask a little bit about obviously the Bank, aside from&#13;
development advice, you know, whatâ&#128;&#153;s the future of the Bank, and obviously sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
is clearly where the Bank has a lot of interest and a lot to offer. But what about China and India?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, the crisis of world poverty now is Africa. And thereâ&#128;&#153;s deep poverty in South&#13;
Asia and many other parts of the world. But somehow you feel that people are starting to get to&#13;
grips with it in a way thatâ&#128;&#153;s working. We all would like to see it go faster and reach more parts,&#13;
but I think the most difficult crisis of world poverty is in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, China is now at an incredibly formative stage, not just for China, but for the&#13;
world. And I have very good experiences in China, and good understandings, friendships and&#13;
contacts, and I have a very longstanding interest. And I thought I was trusted in China. And I&#13;
would have loved to have been part of that continuing story that Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s taking its place in the&#13;
world. I hope I was part of that story, itâ&#128;&#153;s very important to me, and I'd like to have stayed with&#13;
it, so that is another, as it were, as a set of issues that is very important.&#13;
&#13;
And these are definitional years for the world in relation to China. And I think that the big&#13;
picture, the big picture challenge, is what kind of role China is going to take in the world. It&#13;
hasn't been grappled with anywhere near explicitly enough. The Chinese are thinking it through,&#13;
and they're thinking it through in an open, positive way.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Theyâ&#128;&#153;re active in Africa for one thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Nicholas Stern&#13;
                               April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Absolutely, absolutely, and I think we should go out and collaborate with China in&#13;
defining that new role in a very constructive way, as opposed to being defensive and wondering&#13;
whatâ&#128;&#153;s going to happen to it and how do we control it? I think itâ&#128;&#153;s completely the wrong&#13;
approach. The collaborative approach, getting together with China, the Chinese would&#13;
appreciate that enormously, and theyâ&#128;&#153;re quite good at that themselves. So, here we are, in many&#13;
ways China is behaving in a more deep and mature way than those who are trying to watch and&#13;
engage with China. So I think I could have been a big part of that, and Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been keeping up my&#13;
relationships with China in my new job, althoughâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: And finally, of course, India's always been my first love, I mean from just an&#13;
emotional point of view, and I've been going to India constantly since 1974, '75. It's such a&#13;
colorful, engaging, and deeply cultural place with some of the severest problems for poverty and&#13;
development, but some cheerfulness about the chances of getting somewhere. So I would have&#13;
gone to India and China twice a year if I had stayed. They're just such important places. With&#13;
my experiences, I could get things done, and I would have enjoyed it enormously.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I just have a few more questions. I know your time constraints today. But just for&#13;
the record, I would say that people interested in the question about what the major industrial&#13;
countries should do about their subsidies in agriculture should read some of your statements on&#13;
it.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: The answer to that question is get rid of them.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, right, but I thought you had some very good ideas about how to sell this to the&#13;
industrial countries.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I think--I mean I have done frontal assaults, and I described them, I think, as critically&#13;
antiquated, economically illiterate, violently destructive, and ethically indefensible. And I think&#13;
we can substantiate each word in that phrase.&#13;
&#13;
But I think that direct confrontational attack isn't always the best way to get change, although to&#13;
embarrass people, I think, is part of the story. Rural development in rich countries is a perfectly&#13;
legitimate and indeed laudable objective. What's wrong is going about it by subsidizing&#13;
agricultural production. But you have a laudable objective, something which is perfectly okay to&#13;
spend resources on if that's what the political will of the rich countries asks you to do, but it is&#13;
the job of those of us who analyze to draw attention to policies which may have reasonable goals&#13;
being pursued in destructive and misguided ways.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Finally, I wanted to ask your thoughts about a couple things. Now that&#13;
Wolfensohn is leaving in June, has a new assignment just announced in the newspapers, what do&#13;
you think his legacy will be at the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Nicholas Stern&#13;
                              April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Let me just say that--of course, looking at it generally, that that assignment itself&#13;
indicates something about the legacy.&#13;
&#13;
Jim Wolfensohn stuck his neck out to support the development of the Palestinian Authority, and&#13;
he did it with total personal commitment, at risk to himself, physical and reputational, and I take&#13;
my hat off in admiration for what he did. I visited the West Bank/Gaza myself, and saw just how&#13;
tough it was, and spoke at length about it to various audiences.&#13;
&#13;
And there was very strong appreciation for the role of the World Bank. Where the World Bank&#13;
is often an object of easy criticism and uninformed criticism by those who see themselves on the&#13;
radical side of arguments, you would not find that in Palestine. There was an appreciation of the&#13;
way in which the Bank has done its best in very difficult circumstances to try to build, to begin&#13;
building an administration that might work and might deliver something. It was hard and it was&#13;
corrupt--itâ&#128;&#153;s a corrupt story we know, but it is a very important area where the Bank took on a&#13;
difficult world problem courageously, and Jim personally was very much involved in that&#13;
initiative.&#13;
&#13;
But I think if you look at Jimâ&#128;&#153;s legacy, he would have shifted the direction of the Bank in some&#13;
very important ways. He opened the Bank to interaction more. He put centrally the idea of the&#13;
Bank being a supporter of its clients, which is actually standard investment banking that you&#13;
support your clients. But somehow the perceptions and methods of behavior in the World Bank,&#13;
and sometimes itâ&#128;&#153;s still there, is that youâ&#128;&#153;re going to tell people what to do. And Jim tried to&#13;
change that. The language of â&#128;&#156;the country in the driverâ&#128;&#153;s seatâ&#128;? is maybe somewhat inelegant,&#13;
and â&#128;&#156;country ownershipâ&#128;? also inelegant.&#13;
&#13;
But it's the idea that you're trying to help people in directions which is for them to choose. That&#13;
doesn't mean you help them regardless of what they choose. You couldn't do that. But you do&#13;
try to help them along, and that, I think, has changed in perception and ways of behavior,&#13;
mindset, that was very important.&#13;
&#13;
He, for example, mentioned the word "corruption" for the first time, and in so doing brought&#13;
governance to the center of the stage where it must be. He raised the issue of debt, which was&#13;
one of the great unmentionables, it was like heresy to mention debt, but he did it, and started to&#13;
move.&#13;
&#13;
So I think in terms of the attitudes of the Bank and how it behaved, how it tried to support its&#13;
countries over particular issues, and include transparency there, but over particular issues like&#13;
governance and debt and so on Jim had a very strong influence. He had a very strong influence&#13;
in focusing the Bank on poverty. So I think the legacy is strong in terms of what the Bank sees&#13;
itself as doing and what the Bank does.&#13;
&#13;
And in terms of the political stage, I think the Bank could easily have become marginalized and&#13;
irrelevant, but he stopped that, and he made the Bank a real and central force. I think the legacy&#13;
is very big.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Nicholas Stern&#13;
                               April 5 and 16, 2005 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And finally, do you know Paul Wolfowitz, and do you have any thoughts about his&#13;
selection as President of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I met him once for two or three minutes at Jimâ&#128;&#153;s house, and I actually met him&#13;
yesterday. He came to a seminar I and one or two others were giving on the Hill. Unannounced,&#13;
he came and stayed for about an hour. And we talked a bit beforehand.&#13;
&#13;
Heâ&#128;&#153;s a very thoughtful person, a good listener obviously, very interested in Africa, which is why&#13;
he came to the presentation of the report of the Commission for Africa.&#13;
&#13;
So I think that as someone committed to development, draws on his experience in Indonesia, a&#13;
rather reflective man, as well as of course a man whoâ&#128;&#153;s been very much in the action of&#13;
government. I think there's a lot of potential there, so I would start by being optimistic.&#13;
&#13;
On the method of selection, I am actually in favor for all serious jobs in international institutions&#13;
to be selected by a competition, regardless of nationality, to all jobs, whether it be the head of the&#13;
IMF or the World Bank, or more senior appointments in those institutions, or in the UN, or&#13;
wherever.&#13;
&#13;
And actually if you want to read page 380 of the report of the Commission for Africa, it says that&#13;
quite explicitly, and that's--well, it was my pen that wrote it, but it's the 17 Commissioners who&#13;
signed up to it, including the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and Michel Camdessus, the former&#13;
head of the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
So I don't criticize this particular appointment, not to this selection individually. I would&#13;
criticize the whole system which runs across too many international institutions. It should be&#13;
open competition regardless of nationality.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, thank you very much.&#13;
