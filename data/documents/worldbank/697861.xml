MODERNIZATION OF THE STATE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
SECTION A: PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Background&#13;
1. The centralized and control-oriented public management framework that exists in&#13;
Ecuador today provides neither the managerial capacity nor the managerial incentives&#13;
required for effective and efficient management. That this is the case in Ecuador today is&#13;
apparent from the widespread lack of confidence in and disillusionment with the public&#13;
sector's capacity to deliver basic public services. This centralized and control-oriented public&#13;
management framework makes it extremely difficult to effectively and efficiently manage&#13;
those public resources to achieve the fundamental aims of the Government because effective&#13;
management requires both the capacity to tailor managerial decisions to the constantly&#13;
changing conditions faced by any given executing unit (i.e., competent managers endowed&#13;
with adequate autonomy to materially affect the performance of their units) and an&#13;
appropriately designed incentive framework that ensures that managers will use such&#13;
discretion and autonomy to serve the ends of the Government, rather than the narrower aims&#13;
of either their particular organizational unit or themselves personally.&#13;
2. This pattern is not unique to Ecuador. It can be found throughout most of Latin&#13;
America. Furthermore, the creation of such a centralized and control-oriented public&#13;
management framework represents a not entirely irrational response to a very real problem;&#13;
namely, the risk of misuse or abuse of authority by public servants who are not always&#13;
models of moral uprightness or technical or managerial competence. Unfortunately, such a&#13;
response to this risk of the misuse of public resources brings with it a number of debilitating&#13;
drawbacks. Perhaps the two most important of these drawbacks are: (i) such a framework&#13;
makes it extremely difficult to effectively and efficiently manage within the public sector;&#13;
while (ii) this very difficulty induces public agencies, their managers and even politicians to&#13;
seek out all manner of ad hoc devices for circumventing the bottlenecks to effective&#13;
management created by this centralized and control-oriented management framework, thereby&#13;
both reducing the transparency of the overall system while simultaneously undermining its&#13;
capacity to prevent the mismanagement and abuse of authority it was designed to preclude in&#13;
the first place.&#13;
3. That this centralized and control-oriented public management framework has led to the&#13;
proliferation of all manner of devices for circumventing and subverting those centrally&#13;
imposed controls is reflected in numerous symptoms of a public sector gone awry, including:&#13;
a consistent pattern of public employment growth; a proliferation of organizational units&#13;
created outside the normal budgetary and personnel control apparatus; a proliferation of off-&#13;
budget items and earmarked revenues; a proliferation of labor regimes within the public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                          Technical Annex&#13;
sector and a weakened public sector human resource management capacity; a proliferation of&#13;
salary supplements; inability of the Government to recruit and retain middle level&#13;
management, professional and technical personnel.&#13;
4. Public employment growth. Public employment in Ecuador has grown inexorably over&#13;
the last decade and one-half, regardless of whether it is measured in absolute terms or&#13;
relative to population (see Table 1 and Figure 1). The only significant reversal of this trend&#13;
occurred in 1993, when the Government took initial steps toward its Modernization of the&#13;
State program (see below). Total public employment exclusive of uniformed military&#13;
personnel climbed from 193,000 in 1979 to almost 370,000 in 1992, and finally dipped to&#13;
just under 342,000 in 1993. As a share of population, public employment rose from roughly&#13;
2.5% at the beginning of the 1980s to 3.35% by 1992, and finally dipped to 3.02% in 1993.&#13;
Were the Government to set itself the goal of reducing public employment to its early-1980s&#13;
levels relative to population, it would need to eliminate another roughly 50,000 positions by&#13;
the end of 1995, assuming population growth continues at its recent rate of roughly 2.4% per&#13;
annum.&#13;
5. This inexorable growth in public employment could hardly be attributed to a smoothly&#13;
functioning centralized control-oriented framework aimed at keeping public employment in&#13;
check. It represents, instead, evidence that despite the numerous aspects of that framework&#13;
aimed at controlling things such as public employment growth, the final result is just the&#13;
reverse. The turnaround in 1993 raises the question whether the Government has finally&#13;
figured out how to stem the tide of employment growth or whether this downtick is simply&#13;
an aberration.&#13;
6. Proliferation of public agencies partially or wholly exempt from core financial and&#13;
personnel management controls. As of 1992 the Offices of the Presidency and the Vice&#13;
Presidency plus the 14 Ministries counted 46 ascribed entities, 11 autonomous institutions, 20&#13;
autonomous enterprises and 5 decentralized entities under their purview. Each of these 82&#13;
entities represents an exemption from the core control-oriented framework operative within&#13;
the public sector. This plethora of exempt or partially exempt entities has resulted from&#13;
attempts over the years to create more flexible, independent public entities capable of&#13;
managing resources more effectively than is feasible within the core control-oriented&#13;
framework. This proliferation, then, represents a clear indictment of that framework. If that&#13;
framework did not represent a significant impediment to effective management, the incentive&#13;
to create such exempt or semi-exempt entities would be considerably weaker; and only a&#13;
fraction of these 82 entities would probably exist. Significantly, when the Government&#13;
enacted the Modernization of the State Law at the end of 1993, and its subsequent regulation,&#13;
which aimed at correcting many of the flaws in the existing public management framework,&#13;
it created just such an exempt autonomous entity to shepherd that modernization process --&#13;
the National Council for Modernization of the State (CONAM); yet another piece of evidence&#13;
that the existing central control-oriented framework is widely recognized as part of the&#13;
problem rather than part of the solution to improving the performance of the public sector in&#13;
Ecuador.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3                           Technical Annex&#13;
7. Proliferation of off-budget items and earmarked revenues. The Government's budget&#13;
formulation, execution and monitoring process is plagued with a proliferation of off-budget&#13;
items and earmarked revenues. These devices for circumventing the centralized and control-&#13;
driven budget process have proliferated specifically to avoid those centralized controls. They&#13;
represent yet another indictment of the ineffectiveness of that centralized framework: firstly,&#13;
it undermines managerial capacity, thereby engendering efforts to circumvent its constraints;&#13;
and secondly, each successful circumvention of those controls further erodes the capacity of&#13;
that system to either control expenditures or hold public managers accountable for the&#13;
resources they employ and the results they obtain with those resources.&#13;
8. The most obvious and glaring absence of full accounting in the budget is for the&#13;
resources allocated to the National Defense. Although the budgetary allocation to the&#13;
Ministry of Defense covers all projected direct compensation and a few additional&#13;
expenditures, it lacks the bulk of the purchases of materiel, since those are undertaken with&#13;
off-budget earmarked funds primarily from petroleum revenues. The military also controls&#13;
several public companies such as FLOPEC and TRANSNAVE, and is able to administer&#13;
funds arising from these companies with some leeway. With regard to the allocations to the&#13;
different ministries, the current budget system only allocates the direct costs of the programs&#13;
actually administered by the ministries along with the budgetary transfers to the numerous&#13;
entities ascribed to the ministries: entities that actually operate programs within the purview&#13;
of the ministries. Similarly, the allocations for external debt servicing only includes those&#13;
institutions that are fully incorporated into the budget and any explicit budgetary allocations&#13;
for the debt servicing of those entities not included in the budget.&#13;
9. The proposed budget also fails to fully reflect salary costs. By law, the budget is&#13;
presented to Congress in the last week of September of the previous year, and only includes&#13;
the known scheduled increases in public salaries. Since most of the negotiations for salaries&#13;
take place at the beginning of the fiscal year, the proposed budget usually severely&#13;
underestimates the final expenditures for wages and salaries. Not only does the budget&#13;
provide only a limited picture of public sector expenditure, but public and official debate is&#13;
quite limited. The budget evaluation also lacks the systematic input of affected groups.&#13;
10. The existence of numerous and significant expenditures that are not reflected in the&#13;
budget and accounting records of the Government is, like the proliferation of exempt and&#13;
semi-exempt entities, a reflection of continuous organizational and political end-runs around&#13;
the centralized control-oriented management framework in order to protect particular&#13;
programs or units and to permit them greater autonomy over their allocation of those&#13;

financial resources that escape the normal budget process scrutiny. In short, the weak&#13;
expenditure setting and execution capacities of the Government reflect the continual and&#13;
inexorable forces seeking means of circumventing the managerially debilitating impacts of the&#13;
centralized control-oriented financial management framework. The passage of the Budget&#13;
Law of 1992 is only the most recent reflection of the same widespread disaffection with the&#13;
incomplete and ineffective expenditure setting and execution capacity that has resulted from&#13;
these continual, and often successful, attempts to evade the constraints of the centralized&#13;
control-oriented financial management framework.&#13;
11. Proliferation of public sector labor regimes and weakened human resource&#13;
management capacity. Only about 16% of the total public sector labor force is actually&#13;
subject to the Ley de Servicio Civil y Carrera Administrativa. The remainder is subject to&#13;
various sector-specific public sector labor regimes (68%) (e.g., teachers, national police,&#13;
customs administration personnel, universities and poly-technical schools, or other public&#13;
agency labor regimes); is governed by any of a large number of collective contracts (15%);&#13;
or are hired under individual personal services contracts or are outside the normal labor&#13;
regimes (1 %) (see Table 2). This proliferation of labor regimes is another manifestation of&#13;
the failure of the centralized input-control-oriented management framework. The extreme&#13;
rigidity of the framework established by the Ley de Servicio Civil y Carrera Administrativa&#13;
and its centralized administration, the uncompetitive salaries allowed under that regime, the&#13;
bureaucratic red tape engendered by that regime in various types of personnel actions (e.g.,&#13;
in hiring, transferring, promoting and dismissing employees; in adjusting annual salaries,&#13;
etc.) have led not only individual public managers, but the legislature itself to design a&#13;
plethora of parallel labor regimes ostensibly better tailored to the unique circumstances of&#13;
specific sectors (e.g., education, police, armed forces, etc.). It also contributed to the&#13;
incorporation of Article 125 in the Constitution of 1975, which allowed public sector workers&#13;
to form unions and negotiate collective contracts with their employers. Public employees&#13;
have taken advantage of this latter provision to do just that; i.e., they have used yet one&#13;
more device for circumventing a dysfunctional, centralized, input-control-oriented human&#13;
resource management regime.&#13;
12. In short, the proliferation of public sector labor regimes, including the increasing&#13;
incidence of public employees governed by collective contracts under the private sector labor&#13;
law, constitute yet one more indictment of a malfunctioning management framework. This&#13;
proliferation not only illustrates widespread disillusionment with that centralized management&#13;
framework. At the same time, this proliferation undermines the Government's capacity to&#13;
meet even the basic aim of its centralized, input-control-oriented civil service framework --&#13;
namely, preventing misuse and abuse of authority over publicly managed resources -- since&#13;
each of the multitude of labor regimes exempt from the basic civil service framework tend to&#13;
be created with an eye to protecting the interests of the parties most directly affected by those&#13;
exempt labor regimes -- be it teachers, police, members of the individual public sector labor&#13;
unions, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7                           Technical Annex&#13;
13. Difficulty in recruiting and retaining middle level management, professional and&#13;
technical personnel. Centrally fixed public sector salaries are low relative to those available&#13;
in the domestic private sector. More importantly, this discrepancy is more pronounced&#13;
among positions requiring higher level skills, such as managerial and higher level&#13;
professional positions. Table 3 reveals that within a sample of Central Government offices&#13;
and Ministries that encompasses many of the core Central Government functions, Directors&#13;
and Directors General receive on average only between about 6% and 29% of the&#13;
compensation their private sector counterparts receive; professionals receive between about&#13;
25% and 55% of their private sector counterparts; technical personnel receive between about&#13;
40% and 63% of the remuneration available for comparable positions in the private sector;&#13;
while low-skilled service workers tend to receive between about 50% and 100% of their&#13;
private sector counterparts. These comparisons are based on averages within career tracks in&#13;
each of these public agencies relative to specific private sector position types. As such, they&#13;
do not provide as clean a comparison as one would like. Nevertheless, their general pattern&#13;
is unmistakable: the higher the skill level, the less well remunerated are Central Government&#13;
employees relative to their private sector counterparts.&#13;
14. Under these conditions, it is not surprising to find that the Central Government has&#13;
considerable difficulty attracting and retaining highly skilled employees. Nor is it surprising&#13;
to find the previously mentioned widespread practices of hiring many high skill employees&#13;
under contractual arrangements that circumvent the civil service salary structure. While such&#13;
maneuvers solve the immediate problem faced by the executing unit, they ultimately&#13;
undermine the capacity of those units to function effectively; both because such practices&#13;
often undermine morale of the career civil servants and because excessive reliance on such&#13;
spot market contractual arrangements for key managerial functions can undermine the&#13;
institutional memory and shared institutional priorities and behavioral norms required for&#13;
effective management.&#13;
15. Proliferation of salary supplements. This pattern of not only lower wages in the public&#13;
sector, but progressively lower remuneration as the skill requirements increase is no secret&#13;
among higher level officials. Besides being widely recognized as a major contributor to the&#13;
difficulty of recruiting and retaining highly skilled managers and professionals, it has also&#13;
generated a plethora of salary supplements -- each aimed at some particular class of public&#13;
employees -- intended to counter the uncompetitive public sector salaries permitted under the&#13;
general salary scale. Whether that proliferation actually succeeds in bringing the pattern of&#13;
public sector salaries more into line with the private sector competition is difficult to&#13;
ascertain, since the budget data upon which the comparisons in Table 3 are based unreliably&#13;
measure total remuneration due to the budgeting of an unspecified component of salary&#13;
supplements in the "transfers" budget category.&#13;

11                          Technical Annex&#13;
16. Over the years, base salaries have been augmented by adding 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th&#13;
month salaries to each civil servant's base salary, in an ad hoc attempt to top up public&#13;
sector salaries that were inexorably falling behind their private sector counterparts. But this&#13;
device has proved less than fully capable of keeping public sector salaries at any reasonable&#13;
fraction of private sector comparators. As a consequence, a plenitude of additional salary&#13;
supplements have come into existence, not only for career civil servants but also for public&#13;
workers governed by other labor regimes, such as collective contracts. No fewer than 32&#13;
such supplements currently exist in one or more of these labor regimes (see ?).&#13;
17. These salary supplements pose at least two serious problems. First, some of them&#13;
intended to reflect job demands -- such as level of responsibility, experience requirements,&#13;
education requirements, training requirements, etc. -- create perverse incentives. Salary&#13;
supplements for training received, for instance, create strong incentives for public employees&#13;
to seek training in order to qualify for the salary supplement, regardless of whether that&#13;
training improves their on-thejob performance. Since the budgetary system automatically&#13;
increases a budget executing unit's budget to cover these training-linked salary supplements,&#13;
line managers have no incentive to discourage their employees from obtaining useless&#13;
training. Furthermore, those managers are likely to view this device as a means of&#13;
enhancing their employees' salaries at no cost to their unit.&#13;
18. Second, many of these salary supplements are tied to factors that have nothing to do with&#13;
job demands and represent little more than a string of ad hoc attempts to enhance salaries of&#13;
particular, easily mobilized subsets of employees without overhauling the basic salary&#13;
structure by providing targeted salary supplements based on various personal or family&#13;
circumstances (e.g., birth of a child, death, housing assistance, domestic calamity, housing&#13;
calamity, family allowance, etc.).&#13;
19. In sum, the highly centralized, input-control oriented public management system that has&#13;
evolved in Ecuador fails in its primary aim; to control and limit the use of publicly held&#13;
financial and human resources. Public employment, for instance, grew inexorably over the&#13;
last decade and one-half. More importantly, it actually generates the seeds of its own&#13;
malfunctioning. The highly centralized budget system has generated a proliferation of&#13;
devices for circumventing the normal budgetary process, including earmarked revenues and&#13;
off-budget activities. Similarly, the centralized financial control system, including but not&#13;
limited to both the extremely cumbersome procurement process and the reliance on pre-&#13;
control, have led to the proliferation of autonomous entities exempt from many of those&#13;
controls. The highly centralized personnel management system has also generated a plethora&#13;
of labor regimes, salary supplements and other devices for circumventing the controls built&#13;
into that system.&#13;
20. Even more importantly, however, that system undermines good management and&#13;
generates poor management of public resources. For all of these reasons, the Government of&#13;
Ecuador is now undertaking to create a public management framework that will ensure fiscal&#13;
control without undermining public management capacity; a framework that will reward&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                         Technical Annex&#13;
public managers for effectively and efficiently providing the public services for which they&#13;
are responsible; a framework that will withdraw resources from unproductive activities.&#13;
21. Management Reform Efforts The Public Budgets Law mandated program budgeting,&#13;
which is an important step forward. Highlights of this Law include:&#13;
(a) increased coverage of the obligation to submit budget proformas to the MFCP, to&#13;
include the entire central administration;&#13;
(b) introduction of program budgeting;&#13;
(c) reduction of earmarking, introduction of requirements for justification of earmarked&#13;
funds;&#13;
(d) utilization of the banking system for public sector payments;&#13;
(e) requirement for public sector cash management, with annual cash programs initially&#13;
prepared by executing agencies and authorized by SP and ST;&#13;
(f) replacement of individual expenditure authorization by SP and ST with monthly&#13;
credit line replenishments based on the pre-approved cash programs;&#13;
(g) requirement for investment planning, giving SGP responsibility for investment&#13;
project approval;&#13;
(h) provision for multi-year investment programs.&#13;
22. But despite its intellectual appeal, program budgeting has a sorry implementation history.&#13;
The typical pattern is for agencies to develop both a line item budget and a performance&#13;
budget -- the latter to satisfy reporting requirements, while the former really guides both&#13;
management decision-making and the legislature's budget allocation process. For program&#13;
budgets to alter resource allocation decisions, the incentive structure facing management must&#13;
also change in a way that makes both management and the political authorities condition their&#13;
resource allocation decisions on program outcomes, rather than on programs as budget&#13;
aggregations (i.e., organizational units or bureaucracies). In the latter case, budgetary&#13;
decisions typically take the form of adding a modest increment to each program's&#13;
(organizational unit's) previous budget period's allocation; while managers of programs&#13;
operate under the same input-control oriented public management framework as they did&#13;
under a line-item budgetary process. The result is no behavioral change other than the&#13;
generation of a second budget presentation. Consequently, for the program budget mandated&#13;
by the Ley de Presupuesto to yield any tangible improvements, it must be accompanied by&#13;
changes in the incentive structure faced by public managers and political decision-makers.&#13;

23. Fortunately, the Modernization of the State Law (LMOS) provides a mechanism for&#13;
accomplishing this; namely, the public agency restructuring process mandated in that law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                          Technical Annex&#13;
For that restructuring process to materially affect the service delivery performance of&#13;
particular public agencies, it must build incentives around the outputs of the programs for&#13;
which the Budget Law mandates budget formulation, execution, reporting and control. This&#13;
cannot be accomplished by central fiat. It requires that incentives be built into the&#13;
management framework faced by public agencies and their managers, and that those&#13;
incentives be fundamental enough and large enough to elicit management's commitment to&#13;
effectively and efficiently produce the outputs for which their agencies are responsible. The&#13;
Modernization of the State Technical Assistance Project is designed specifically to address&#13;
this challenge. It builds on the framework established by the Government in these two&#13;
milestone laws -- the Public Budgets Law and the Modernization of the State Law.&#13;
24. Besides securing the approval of important legislation, since assuming office in August&#13;
1992, the Government has taken a number of administrative measures to modernize its&#13;
economy and reform its public sector. The public sector payroll has been reduced by 21,000&#13;
employees representing more than 5 percent of public employment, and the Government has&#13;
begun to contract with the private sector for the delivery of important services. The&#13;
Government has also begun a program of public sector divestiture and deregulation of the&#13;
economy, with the sale of public sector assets and shares owned in small enterprises and with&#13;
the elimination of a large number of obsolete regulations. The Government has advanced the&#13;
development of procedures for implementation of the Budget Law, and has developed a&#13;
strategy to establish an incentive program for the restructuring of public sector agencies,&#13;
whereby those agencies that meet certain goals of employment reduction and sales of assets&#13;
can apply a portion of the savings to improve the existing depressed salary scale. At least&#13;
five public entities, or units thereof, have already been restructured according to preliminary&#13;
guidelines developed by SENDA.&#13;
25. Future Priorities. The reforms in the public sector aim to restructure ministries and&#13;
agencies according to a process of redefinition of objectives and goals and to modernize their&#13;
management. A key tool for effecting those changes and establishing better priorities in&#13;
public sector will be the implementation of the Budget Law.&#13;
26. This will entail the need for all public sector institutions to present their budget for&#13;
review and certification by the Ministry of Finance, before approval. The presentation of the&#13;
Budget will have to be accompanied by a catalog of their activities, programs, objectives,&#13;
measurable goals, the number of civil servants and positions available, and their debts.&#13;
During the presentation of the 1996 Budget, the Government will introduce the multi-annual&#13;
budgeting plan as called for under the law.&#13;
27. The law also requires, and the Executive will ensure, that all investment projects by&#13;
public sector entities be included in the annual investment plans and reviewed by the&#13;
Secretariat of Planning (SGP) before its inclusion in the budget. For this purpose, SGP will&#13;
have to strengthen its capacity to analyze investment projects and to issue rulings on the&#13;
project's compliance with sound investment criteria. The Government is preparing an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15                         Technical Annex&#13;
implementation plan outlining the criteria for such reviews and the measures that will be&#13;
taken to guarantee the capacity of SGP to attend to its mandate.&#13;
28. An important change in budgetary execution will be the elimination before January 1995&#13;
of existing drawing authorizations (cupos de giros) for each expenditure by MFCP. A new&#13;
system of authorizations will be extended according to cash flow programming that is&#13;
consistent with each agency's budget. The transfer of funds will be done automatically with&#13;
the introduction of a budget payments system through the private banking network. This&#13;
new form of payments will replace the existing central control with a decentralized system of&#13;
budgetary management, thereby greatly increasing efficiency and establishing accountability.&#13;
The Executive is coordinating closely with the Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE) in the&#13;
introduction of the new payments system to ensure it contributes to the appropriate&#13;
management of monetary and macroeconomic policies.&#13;
29. The Budget Law made a substantial contribution to sound fiscal management by limiting&#13;
the practice of earmarking of revenues. To ensure that future legislation does not weaken or&#13;
erode the progress achieved so far, the Executive is committed to prevent the introduction of&#13;
any earmarking provisions not consistent with its policy of cost recovery and revenue&#13;
strengthening. Furthermore, the Government will embark on a review of existing&#13;
earmarking programs to determine those that will be gradually phased out.&#13;
30. To rationalize the current system of transfers, the Government will introduce safeguards&#13;
that any investment project financed with transfers outside the original program (through&#13;
extra-budgetary transfers) complies with the same prerequisites of any other investment&#13;
project included in the budget. Furthermore, the Government intends to establish new&#13;
criteria, consistent with the existing revenue sharing program, for the system of transfers that&#13;
will be incorporated in a new legal framework for decentralization that will be sent to&#13;
Congress in 1995. This law will also set the guidelines for a program of decentralization of&#13;
responsibilities and activities within the public sector.&#13;
31. Implementation of the budgetary reform will require the introduction of a new system of&#13;
public debt management and control in both the MFCP and the BCE as well as the need to&#13;
strengthen the counterpart units within MFCP in general and the SP, in particular. The new&#13;
debt information system will be installed before January 1995, when the Government expects&#13;
to have achieved substantial progress in the restructuring the central budget agencies to give&#13;
then the institutional capacity to operate the new budget process.&#13;
32. Another component of the modernization program is to make effective use of the&#13;
Modernization of the State LAW (LMOS) to effect a reduction in public sector employment&#13;
and to accelerate the program of public sector restructuring. The law introduced an incentive&#13;
program of indemnization for those civil servants who decide to leave the public sector&#13;
before the end of 1996. The Government expects that an additional 5.5 percent of public&#13;
employees will take advantage of the program. The present value of the indemnization costs&#13;
for these additional departures is projected to reach approximately US$195 million, which is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                          Technical Annex&#13;
expected to be financed through bonds, which will be retired via proceeds from divestment of&#13;
assets plus a fraction of the salary savings achieved through those employment reductions.&#13;
33. Effective use of the indemnization program will be accomplished through the&#13;
restructuring program for public sector agencies. This program, managed by SENDA,&#13;
requires that each agency or ministry present a restructuring plan to increase efficiency and&#13;
improve services (within the goals and objectives identified in the budget process) along with&#13;
a plan for reduction of personnel and sale of assets, if any. Once this restructuring plan is&#13;
approved by CONAM and SENDA, the agency will be able to retain a percentage of its&#13;
current savings to upgrade the salary scale of its employees, will receive support for the&#13;
implementation of the plan, will be given the financial and technical support to improve its&#13;
information and management system, and will be given greater financial and administrative&#13;
autonomy. The Government is committed to having a significant number of key agencies&#13;
complete their restructuring program by June 1995, and the rest by early 1996.&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
34.    Lessons from general Bank experience: Poor institutional capacity is one of the&#13;
most important hurdles to the implementation of investment projects in developing countries.&#13;
Unfortunately, Bank experience with institutional development TA projects has proved&#13;
disappointing for a variety of reasons. The proposed project would be designed to address&#13;
these constraints: supply-driven TA, lack of commitment on the part of target institutions;&#13;
insufficient preparation and short implementation times, based on over-optimistic estimates;&#13;
TA fund-based, as opposed to project-focused implementation approach; Bank-driven,&#13;
extremely ambitious scope; weak monitoring, lacking measurable outputs; and excessive&#13;
reliance on expatriate consultants.&#13;
35.    Successful TA projects, on the other hand, exhibit some characteristics which the&#13;
proposed project would strive to replicate: avoiding the danger of institutional proliferation&#13;
by utilizing and strengthening existing institutions rather than creating new ones, and&#13;
dismantling unnecessary ones; introducing standard or routinized management and&#13;
administrative procedures; and establishing a process approach to project methodology with&#13;
well-defined, measurable results to facilitate project management and monitoring.&#13;
36.    In the LAC region, TA projects follow patterns that confirm the global experience,&#13;
with the added complexity of multiple components, implementing agencies and donors.&#13;
Another lesson from past experience, the need for in-depth analytic and sector work to&#13;
precede public sector reform TA projects, has been met in this case, as a major Public&#13;
Expenditure Review, which analyzed the fundamental issues facing Ecuador's public sector,&#13;
including its budgetary and civil service arrangements, preceded project preparation.&#13;
37. Lessons from previous Bank proiects in Ecuador: In Ecuador, the weakness of the&#13;
public sector managerial and administrative capacity is reflected in the active loan portfolio,&#13;
which, as of March 1994, numbered 14 approved projects (totalling US$723.9 million in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17                          Technical Annex&#13;
commitments), of which 11 have explicit institution-building components. Recognizing the&#13;
persistent weakness of the Ecuadoran public sector, institution building is a major objective&#13;
of the Bank's lending strategy: of the 7 projects in the proposed FY94-96 lending program&#13;
(totalling US$ 243.6 million), 5 are for technical assistance.&#13;
38. A pervasive issue in Ecuador is political fragmentation, coupled with the mandatory&#13;
change in administration every four years, which suggests the need for short-term, tangible&#13;
results to accompany to longer-term objectives. The Public Financial Management and&#13;
Control component of the proposed project would address this need. Additional issues to&#13;
consider include the requirement for focused identification of project components; the&#13;
frequent turnover of managers; the critical requisite for an active, well-connected project&#13;
leader; the requirements for strong coordination among implementing agencies and among&#13;
donors (especially the 1DB); the need for close project supervision; and the possibility of&#13;
diminishing official commitment as the electoral process approaches. Project design would&#13;
also safeguard against Project Coordination Units eventually substituting for real and&#13;
sustainable institution-building actions by ensuring that training and technology transfer take&#13;
place during project implementation and are institutionalized.&#13;
Institutional Framework&#13;
39. The main institutions involved in the design and implementation of the Government's&#13;
public sector reform and modernization efforts are the following:&#13;
40. The Council for Modernization of the State (CONAM) was created by Decree No.&#13;
143 (Official Register No. 42, October 7, 1992) as a dependency of the Office of the&#13;
President, initially to assist with the privatization of parastatals. The President of CONAM&#13;
is appointed by the President of the Republic. CONAM's broader function as embodied in&#13;
the LMOS is to establish the legal, economic, financial, technical, social, political and&#13;
human resource base to fulfill the MOS initiative. In this regard it is to help develop the&#13;
mechanisms necessary to obtain and channel private national and international financial&#13;
resources to implement privatization initiatives. It also is required to complete the evaluation&#13;
studies necessary, with the cooperation of SENDA and other Government agencies, and&#13;
define an action plan for each measure undertaken in the Government's modernization&#13;
process.&#13;
41. The Executive Director of CONAM is given the responsibility for its day-to-day&#13;
operations, including assisting the Council in the study, design, and implementation of the&#13;
MOS programs, as well as proposing ways to obtain and channel resources to carry out these&#13;
programs. CONAM's Executive Director is also responsible for proposing an annual&#13;
program of activities and designating and contracting for services to fulfill CONAM's&#13;
mandate.&#13;
42. The entities and organisms in the public sector are obligated to provide CONAM with&#13;
the necessary studies, reports, statistical data, financial status, and general administrative and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                          Technical Annex&#13;
economic information, technical support, and any other request solicited to assure compliance&#13;
with MOS objectives in accordance with the law.&#13;
43. The Project Working Group (PWG) will be lodged in CONAM and will be responsible&#13;
for overseeing day-to-day project implementation by the respective executing agencies and&#13;
for making policy recommendations for CONAM's approval. Project administration will be&#13;
handled by a project Administrative Unit, lodged within CONAM, and headed by the&#13;
Administrative Coordinator for the project. All policy decisions with respect to the execution&#13;
of the project would be made by the Executive Director of CONAM, a cabinet-level&#13;
appointee by the President.&#13;
44. Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFCP), within the context of the new Budget&#13;
Law (Title I, Article 3) is responsible for establishing the policies, norms, technical&#13;
specifications, as well as actions and for executing, coordinating, evaluating, and determining&#13;
the balance of public sector budgets (with the exception of the Social Security Institute). As&#13;
part of the reform effort, MFCP directs the fiscal policy and coordinates the national system&#13;
of public budgets with the SGP to assure compliance with the Budget Law.&#13;
45. Entities and organisms of government by law must observe the budgetary process&#13;
according to the general lines of action, directives, and strategies of economic and social&#13;
policy, as well as the short and medium-term national development plans and programs of&#13;
the Government. Moreover, the MFCP now must establish budgetary classifications that will&#13;
provide the framework for budgetary management (Title II, Article 10(c)). These&#13;
classifications are obligatory for budgeting throughout the public sector.&#13;
46. National Secretariat for Administrative Development (SENDA) was created by Ley&#13;
16 in February 1989 (subsequently published in the Official Registry March 7, 1989). The&#13;
regulatory framework for the internal functions of SENDA appeared in the form of a&#13;
Ministerial Accord No. 056 of July 26, 1990, published in the Official Register August 9,&#13;
1990. Its purpose is to: (a) delineate administrative policies and formulate and execute&#13;
programs, evaluate the efficiency of operations in the public administration and fulfill the&#13;
purposes and objectives programmed; (b) monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of public&#13;
sector institutions to carry out their responsibilities; (c) investigate complaints and claims&#13;
about the service in the management of public funds; advise the public sector institutions on&#13;
their reorganization and administrative structure and in the adoption of technical&#13;
administrative procedures appropriate to improve their public services. SENDA also&#13;
provides assistance in the restructuring of public sector entities and their dependencies.&#13;
47. National Planning Secretariat (SGP) sets general economic and social policies and&#13;
develop corresponding development plans. The actions, duties, responsibilities, and&#13;
attributions of SGP are oriented to meet the institutional objectives and purposes, which&#13;
requires the establishment of an adequate technical and administrative framework. According&#13;
to Decree No. 249A, l993, sets general economic and social policies. Development and&#13;
reform plans are submitted for approval by the President of the Republic. SGP also proposes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19                          Technical Annex&#13;
the modalities and sources of funds for the financing of national, regional, and provincial&#13;
development plans. SGP also recommends government budgetary priorities as well as for&#13;
other entities and organisms in the public sector, and determines the general policies for&#13;
external assistance relative to the national development plans. SGP coordinates the execution&#13;
and evaluation of the development plans with sector organisms, business, labor and social&#13;
organizations, and the National Social Security Council. Finally, SGP is responsible for&#13;
countering the proliferation of parallel programs and for assessing the progress toward the&#13;
effective regionalization of the country in terms of the results of agreed national planning and&#13;
development policies.&#13;
48. Comptroller General of the State (CGE) is the government agency responsible for the&#13;
systems of accounting and auditing for public resources, which functions are described in the&#13;
Ley Organica de Administraci6n Financiera y Control (LOAFYC) in article 303 and its 26&#13;
articles, relative to its responsibility to set public sector standards by to emitting policies,&#13;
norms, manuals, and other regulations that permit the design, installation, and functioning of&#13;
accounting and auditing systems, with reference to articles 6, 7, and 13 of LOAFYC. Within&#13;
the context of the MOS initiative, and specifically its purposes of installing an integrated&#13;
financial management system, the framework is given in articles 128 of the Political&#13;
Constitution, Article 2 of the Budget Law, and Article 383 of the LOAFYC. In accordance&#13;
with Article 59 of the Constitution of the State, the Comptroller General of the State, head of&#13;
CGE, is appointed by Congress, based on a candidate proposed by the President of the&#13;
republic. Article 116 of the Constitution indicates that the Controller General's appointment&#13;
will be for four years.&#13;
49. LOAFYC provides CGE with an ample mandate, involving the following principal&#13;
functions and responsibilities: (a) perform financial and operational audits of entities and&#13;
agencies subject to its control, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards; (b)&#13;
review and evaluate the quality of audits performed by the internal audit units (throughout the&#13;
public sector); (c) qualify, select and appoint private firms to perform independent audits of&#13;
entities and agencies subject to its control, and supervise their work; (d) control or overview&#13;
public civil works projects, employing necessary techniques to accomplish the control of all&#13;
phases involved; (e) perform special examinations over tax revenues and/or non-tax revenues&#13;
of public entities and agencies, with a view to issuing recommendations to improve&#13;
procedures relating to the issuance of public debt titles and the collection of revenues; (f)&#13;
issue and update policies, procedures, standards, manuals and instructions, with respect to&#13;
government auditing and government accounting, including the consolidations of financial&#13;
information; (g) prescribe the form and content of financial reports to be presented to MFCP,&#13;
to CGE and to Junta de Planificaci6n; (h) provide technical assistance to public entities and&#13;
agencies with regard to the implementation of systems and procedures; (i) norm, coordinate&#13;
and provide technical training to public service personnel; (j) manage the government&#13;
accounting systems and control of the state resources systems; (k) others as the law requires.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20                          Technical Annex&#13;
Project Description.&#13;
Component I: Public Financial Management and Control&#13;
50. The Public Financial Management and Control component of the project would have the&#13;
general objective of streamlining and modernizing the processes of planning, budgeting,&#13;
budget execution, accounting and control of the Ecuadoran public sector, in accord with the&#13;
mandate of the Public Budgets Law. Activities within this component fall into seven broad&#13;
categories: (i) budget and treasury system; (ii) public credit/debt management system; (iii)&#13;
accounting system; (iv) auditing of public resources; (v) public contracting; (vi) payroll and&#13;
personnel systems; and (vii) integration of the information systems covered by the other&#13;
subcomponents.&#13;
51. Subcomponent 1: Public Budget and Treasury System This sub-component includes&#13;
five distinct sets of activities designed to:&#13;
(a) strengthen the medium-term budgetary system, enabling the projection of medium-&#13;
term income and expenditures and the linking of the budget process with medium-&#13;
term investments in the context of a multi-year budget;&#13;
(b) strengthen the budget formulation process by introducing an integrated budget&#13;
structure for Public Sector Entities, featuring quantified program objectives,&#13;
financial projections of revenues and expenditures in a cash budget, and limited use&#13;
of earmarked funds;&#13;
(c) strengthen budget execution through implementation of a system to manage and&#13;
supervise budget execution, for the support of program management and&#13;
accountability, including the corresponding normative manuals and accounting&#13;
procedures that allow payments to be made through the banking system;&#13;
(d) strengthen program control and evaluation, through implementing a system covering&#13;
all financial transactions and investments of selected Public Sector Entities; and&#13;
(e) developing the capacity to manage and supervise modernization funds to support&#13;
investments in social development.&#13;
52. Medium-term budgetary process activities are intended to tie the budget formulation and&#13;
execution process to the planning process in order to ensure that the budget allocations are in&#13;
fact responsive to the policies of the Government, and its execution is consistent with the&#13;
established program goals. In addition it will extend the planning horizon beyond one year&#13;
into the medium term (four years), allowing for the formulation and evaluation of multi-year&#13;
investment plans. It will also involve a delineation of responsibilities for the planning process&#13;
among the SGP, the SP and the executing agencies. It will include the establishment of&#13;
norms, procedures and methodologies for: (i) the formulation of medium-term&#13;
macroeconomic, sectoral and budgetary policies; (iii) the evaluation of the consistency of&#13;
investment plans with public policy; (iv) the formulation of the annual investment plan; (v)&#13;
the processing of multi-year investment projects. In addition, it will provide for quality&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21                          Technical Annex&#13;
evaluations of program budget execution in cooperation with SGP. Specific activities for this&#13;
sub-component are:&#13;
(a) identifying areas of responsibility for the planning process and its inputs to the&#13;
budgeting process; establishing information flows among the institutions responsible&#13;
for the function: the executing agencies, the SGP and the SP;&#13;
(b) establishing norms, procedures and methodologies for the coordination, formulation&#13;
and evaluation of medium-term multi-year macro-economic, sectoral and budgetary&#13;
policies based on the Government's agenda;&#13;
(c) establishing norms, procedures and methodologies for the formulation of the annual&#13;
investment program, based on medium-term policies and for the formulation and&#13;
financial management of multi-year investment projects;&#13;
(d) preparing a draft Public Investments Law.&#13;
53. Budget Formulation and Cash Programming (SP/ST) activities are intended to create the&#13;
capacity to formulate program budgets and to program cash income and expenditure on a&#13;
yearly basis, at the MFCP and at all administrative levels of the central government entities,&#13;
with a view to strengthening the entities' planning capabilities and increasing their&#13;
accountability for investment projects in the long run. The 1994 central government budget&#13;
has been prepared based on the new guidelines, although most of the effort involved various&#13;
units at MFCP, and much work remains to be done, especially at the decentralized entities.&#13;
Procedures, manuals and training courses to assist staff in the transition to the new system&#13;
are under preparation. Even though it is the Government's policy to reduce the usage of&#13;
earmarked funds throughout the economy, a number of instances exist where this practice&#13;
remains and the new Budget Law regulates their reporting. A yearly study of the extent of&#13;
earmarking will be conducted and strict enforcement of the Law's reporting requirements will&#13;
be put in place. Specific activities of this sub-component would include:&#13;
(a) development of a uniform coding structure, a methodology for projections,&#13;
simulations and budget formulation for use in the public sector planning, budgeting&#13;
and accounting processes, by all institutions, centralized and decentralized;&#13;
(b) establishment of a yearly analysis of earmarked income and expenditure in the public&#13;
sector entities, and development of the norms and procedures for their budgeting and&#13;
expenditure;&#13;
(c) development of the norms and procedures for the preparation of the annual cash&#13;
program by the public sector entities and for their evaluation and consolidation at the&#13;
SP;&#13;
(d) development of the norms and procedures for establishing yearly deficit/surplus&#13;
agreements with public sector enterprises;&#13;
(e) development of the norms, procedures and methodologies for central budget&#13;
evaluation by the SP and strengthen its ability to adjust the budget submissions of&#13;
the entities to macroeconomic targets and to the Government's policies;&#13;
(f) development of budget formulation and evaluation capacity at the entity level,&#13;
establish training programs and produce manuals and guidelines for their staff, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22                          Technical Annex&#13;
conduct periodic reviews of their practices during the first three years of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
54. Budget Execution (ST) activities are meant to reform the process of budget execution to&#13;
shift responsibility for payment approval away from the ST to the entities, automating as far&#13;
as possible the payments process and ensuring the availability of funds for accrued payments,&#13;
by: (i) developing the entities' capacity for cash management and placing responsibility for&#13;
approval of individual payments with them; (ii) establishing credit lines for each entity at the&#13;
BCE, to be replenished monthly by the ST on the basis of the budget and the annual cash&#13;
program (iii) using the private banking system for public sector payments and (iv) improving&#13;
the ST's capacity to project income and payments by establishing information flows with the&#13;
Subsecretarfa de Rentas for tax income and the SCP for debt service payments. Specific&#13;
activities under this subcomponent would include:&#13;
(a) establishing norms and procedures for cash projection and treasury management and&#13;
the necessary changes to insure information flows at the BCE, the SR, the SCP and&#13;
the ST;&#13;
(b) establishing norms and procedures for using the private banking system to effect&#13;
public sector payments;&#13;
(c) implementing the new treasury procedures by disseminating them to all entities of&#13;
the public sector and conducting reviews of the application of the new procedures&#13;
after their adoption by the entities;&#13;
(d) implementing the processing of public sector payments via the private banking&#13;
system;&#13;
55. Program Control and Evaluation activities will establish requirements and indicators for&#13;
control and evaluation within the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, the Secretariat&#13;
General of Planning, the Central Bank of Ecuador and the National Secretariat for&#13;
Administrative Development. It will establish methodologies and guidelines for budget&#13;
controls in the areas of budget authorization, budget execution through the banking network,&#13;
budget commitments, budget payments, budget modifications as well as the investment&#13;
budget. Budget evaluation will be strengthened in macroeconomic policy, budget&#13;
programming, the Annual Investment Program, sectoral budgets and regional budgets.&#13;
56. An important element of this subcomponent will be to reorganize all areas of the MFCP,&#13;
to adapt their structures to their new functions in the radically changed financial management&#13;
environment. The SP has completed this process; the ST has initiated it; the SCP is yet at an&#13;
early planning stage. Specific activities would include completing the reorganization of the&#13;
ST and planning and executing the reorganization of the SCP.&#13;
57. Modernization Funds activities will develop the management framework, structures and&#13;
guidelines required to exercise appropriate fiduciary responsibility in the management of&#13;
special funds generated by the modernization process and dedicated to enhancing productive&#13;
investments in social infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23                          Technical Annex&#13;
58. Subcomponent 2: Debt Management/Public Credit System This subcomponent is&#13;
meant to (i) improve planning for public debt contracting and its relation to the budget&#13;
planning and cash management functions; (ii) improve the procedures for debt servicing and&#13;
establish the related information flows between the SCP, the ST and the BCE that are&#13;
required in order to manage the treasury function; (iii) train a selected cadre of staff of the&#13;
SCP and BCE in financial matters relating to contract evaluation, derivative instruments&#13;
(options, swaps, futures), asset/liability management, financial (currency and interest rate)&#13;
and commodity risk hedging. Specific activities would include:&#13;
(a) analyzing the legal framework for debt management to identify potential&#13;
shortcomings in the planning, negotiating and contracting of public debt, especially&#13;
as relates to Government debt guarantees;&#13;
(b) defining and regulating the roles of the MFCP areas (SCP, ST, SP) and of the BCE&#13;
that participate in debt management, and establishing the required information flows;&#13;
(c) specifying the information system required to support debt management taking into&#13;
account the needs of all the agencies involved;&#13;
(d) acquiring and installing, if possible, on a turnkey basis, a debt management&#13;
information system that will allow all agencies involved to have complete, timely&#13;
information on loans, commitments, guarantees, disbursements, payment schedules&#13;
and debt service;&#13;
(e) designing financial training courses based on the needs of the agencies involved and&#13;
on their available staff resources; selecting or recruiting the required human&#13;
resources; delivering the training courses.&#13;
59. Subcomponent 3: Government Accounting This subcomponent is meant to improve&#13;
the accounting process, by decentralizing it to the central government entities, and by&#13;
improving the timeliness of the accounting cycle. Specific activities would include:&#13;
(a) improving the definition of the roles of the individual entities, the ST and the CGE&#13;
in the accounting process, including the establishment of tight timetables for the&#13;
delivery of information;&#13;
(b) participating in the specification of accounting requirements for the SIGEF, to be&#13;
incorporated in the financial management and administrative information systems,&#13;
rather than as separate application systems;&#13;
(c) ensuring adherence to standards of general acceptance resulting in information of&#13;
quality and timeliness required for decision making.&#13;
60. Subcomponent 4: Audit of Public Resources The CGE is undergoing a modernization&#13;
process, intended to shift its operating policy in three major aspects: (i) modifying its ex-&#13;
ante, sanctioning role and assuming an ex-post, fraud-preventing, efficiency-seeking, and&#13;
normative stance; and (ii) changing from an operational auditor role to that of a supervisor of&#13;
contracts for audits performed by private sector firms; and (iii) assuming its role as overseer&#13;
of the internal audit units that the Budget Law creates in all public sector agencies. This&#13;
subcomponent is meant to assist the CGE in these initiatives, while focusing on: (i) the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                          Technical Annex&#13;
implementation of the audit and control provisions of the new Budget Law. Specific actions&#13;
would include:&#13;
(a) establishing norms, procedures, methodologies and manuals for all types of controls&#13;
mandated by the Budget Law: ex-ante, concurrent, ex-post, random, operating,&#13;
informatics; and for the contracting of private sector audits. The function of&#13;
controlling the State resources should encompass "normatividad" and control ex-post&#13;
and should exclude case-by-case control ex-ante, in any of its forms;&#13;
(b) participating in the specification of audit and control requirements for the SIGEF, to&#13;
be incorporated in the financial management and administrative information systems,&#13;
rather than as separate application systems;&#13;
(c) reorganizing the CGE to conform to its policy changes and to its new role in the&#13;
financial management environment created by the new Budget Law, specifically in&#13;
the regulation and supervision of the internal audit units that the Law provides for in&#13;
all public sector agencies. The main purpose of this reorganization would be to&#13;
achieve decentralization and to create a high level cluster of four principal functional&#13;
departments, reporting directly to Controller General;&#13;
61. Subcomponent 5: Public Sector Contracting This sub-component will include&#13;
activities to modernize the legal framework and operating practices for public sector&#13;
contracting. This will be accomplished by drafting a new public sector procurement law and&#13;
its regulation, to cover the procurement of all public sector acquisitions of goods and&#13;
services, local and international; assisting in the design of the administrative processes and&#13;
information systems to support the procurement function, and the design of training programs&#13;
for staff handling procurement processes throughout the public sector. The provisions of the&#13;
new procurement law would be expected to include international bidding standards covering&#13;
assurances, among others, that foreign bidders would not be required to have their financial&#13;
solvency, guarantees, registration, and other conditions for bidding, be recertified by local&#13;
institutions in addition to already existing certification from acceptable foreign institutions&#13;
(e.g.: banks, government agencies).&#13;
62. Subcomponent 6: Payroll and Personnel Subsystem This sub-component is intended&#13;
to integrate the management of human resources throughout the public sector with the rest of&#13;
financial management in an integrated and distributed manner by:&#13;
(a) establishing a human resources management subsystem, integrated with the SIGEF&#13;
to maintain a centralized database of public sector employees at SENDA, that will&#13;
support the functions of personnel management at SENDA and at each Ministry, and&#13;
which will be accessible on-line from all the participating agencies and from the&#13;
MFCP;&#13;
(b) establishing a payroll subsystem, and the corresponding regulations, integrated with&#13;
the SIGEF that will ensure that no public sector employee, regardless of status&#13;
(servicio civil, c6digo de trabajo, contratos eventuales, et al.), will be in the payroll&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25                         Technical Annex&#13;
unless his or her designation has prior SENDA approval and is included in the&#13;
appropriate budget category ("partida presupuestaria").&#13;
(c) redesigning affected operational procedures and practices for the adoption of the&#13;
human resources and personnel sub-systems of the SIGEF; training of users at the&#13;
various institutions; implementing the sub-systems; and specifying desired&#13;
performance standards for the monitoring of the human resource and payroll&#13;
management functions.&#13;
63. Subcomponent 7: Integration of Information Systems The purpose of this sub-&#13;
component is to ensure that the information systems required to support financial and&#13;
administrative functions throughout the Ecuadoran public sector, which would comprise the&#13;
SIGEF, would be of high quality, compatible, and could be interconnected, and would&#13;
coordinate their acquisition across the numerous institutions involved in order to benefit from&#13;
economies of scale. Specific activities under this component would include:&#13;
(a) specifying, acquiring and implementing a prototype system to serve the dual purpose&#13;
of (i) facilitating the specification of the SIGEF and (ii) providing bare-bones&#13;
informatics support to the new financial management environment during the time --&#13;
estimated at one year-- between the effectiveness of the Budget Law and the full&#13;
implementation of the SIGEF;&#13;
(b) carrying out an informatics plan;&#13;
(c) functional specification of the application systems to support the financial&#13;
management and administrative functions, incorporating the requirements of the&#13;
control and audit functions throughout all applications;&#13;
(d) management of the acquisitions process for the SIGEF hardware, system software,&#13;
application software and site management;&#13;
(e) management of the SIGEF adaptation, installation and user training processes;&#13;
(f) transition of SIGEF management to permanent organizational arrangements.&#13;
64. The process of specifying and acquiring the SIGEF will be managed by&#13;
the Informatics Commission, comprising representatives from the systems areas of the&#13;
agencies involved, and chaired by the Informatics Coordinator in CONAM. The first&#13;
activity of the Informatics Commission will be the formulation of the Informatics Plan, which&#13;
will specify:&#13;
(a) the organizational framework for the SIGEF, including the option of out-sourcing&#13;
the operation (site management) of the systems to private sector contractors;&#13;
(b) the SIGEF system-wide specifications, defined in terms of standard performance&#13;
measures, including service level requirements, response times, transaction traffic&#13;
and peak work loads, storage requirements, user interfaces, maintenance&#13;
requirements, documentation, archiving, security, version control, backup and&#13;
recovery procedures;&#13;
(c) the appropriate technology environment to support it, including the hardware&#13;
(servers, work stations, media) and system software (OS, NOS, database engine and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26                           Technical Annex&#13;
other system tools) architecture; and the telecommunications (LAN, WAN)&#13;
infr-astructure; and the required warranties;&#13;
(d) the functional specification of the application systems to support the financial&#13;
miana(cement and administrative functions, incorporating the requirements of the&#13;
conitrol and audit functions throughout all applications, and based on the norms and&#13;
regulations emilanatinig from the Budget Law, which will be designed by the relevant&#13;
institutions' specialists and consultants, within their respective components;&#13;
(e) the office automation (word processing, spreadsheet, database) and user services (e-&#13;
mail, groupware, news services) requirements;&#13;
(f) the technical requirements for systems management, specifically: configuration&#13;

be appointed no later than 12/94. Bidding documents will be prepared by the PWG,&#13;
consistent with Bank g uidelines. The bidding process, the selection of contractors, vendors&#13;
and consultants and adaptation of systems will be executed according to the schedule defined&#13;
in the Informatics Plan.&#13;

UNCTAD, should be completed by 5/95; installation and completion dates, as well as costs&#13;
for the debt management system implementation should be set forth in this study. Further&#13;
details of this portion of the program are in the Project Files.&#13;
67. A det.iled description of the informatics aspects of SIGEF may be found in the Project&#13;
Files.&#13;
Component II: Public Sector Modernization&#13;
68. Objectives: The objectives of this component are (i) to enhance the quantity and quality&#13;
of specific public services provided through central government agencies, excluding the&#13;
autonomous institutes and public enterprises, without increasing public expenditures and (ii)&#13;
to create an institutional framework that creates incentives that promise not only to sustain&#13;
these improvements but also to continuously expand and augment them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27                          Technical Annex&#13;
69. Strategv: The public sector modernization strategy is built around two basic principles:&#13;
imposition of timely and reliable controls coupled with the creation of strong incentives for&#13;
public agencies and their managers and employees to produce needed public services&#13;
effectively and efficiently. Financial controls are to be provided within the financial&#13;
management component of the project; while the public sector modernization component --&#13;
and in particular, the restructuring strategy encompassed within this component -- creates the&#13;
incentive framework necessary to complement those strengthened and streamlined financial&#13;
controls. Timely and effective controls are essential both to prevent abuse of authority -- be&#13;
it over financial or human resources -- and to establish one of the preconditions for an&#13;
incentives-based public management framework; namely, binding resource constraints. A&#13;
coherent and integrated incentive framework is essential because the managers and other&#13;
employees of public agencies, being human beings, respond to incentives. Moreover, the&#13;
performance of those agencies is fundamentally determined by their managers and&#13;
employees. The challenge is to get the incentives facing those managers and employees&#13;
properly designed.&#13;
70. Consistent with these principles, the approach detailed below creates incentives for&#13;
individual central government agencies to restructure in order to improve their capacity to&#13;
deliver clearly specified services to their clients, lodging responsibility for taking the&#13;
initiative to do so with those line agencies. A detailed statement of precisely this incentives-&#13;
based restructuring strategy may be found in Attachment 1. This strategy resists the&#13;
temptation to have a central agency, such as CONAM or SENDA, restructure those line&#13;
agencies itself; because it recognizes that if the restructuring process is to yield significant&#13;
and sustained service provision improvements, it must be driven by the initiative of the&#13;
affected agencies and their employees. Nonetheless, CONAM and SENDA will play a&#13;
crucial role in this process, as they establish and enforce the incentive framework within&#13;
which all restructurings will be undertaken.&#13;
71. The public sector modernization component includes three subcomponents: (i)&#13;
strengthening of the investment planning and evaluation capacities of the Secretaria General&#13;
de Planificaci6n (SGP); (ii) restructuring and strengthening central government agencies to&#13;
improve their management capacities and performance; and (iii) coordination of all training&#13;
included in the entire project.&#13;
72. Subcomponent 1: Strengthening of the Planning Framework (SGP). As a&#13;
complement to the Public Financial Management and Control component's activities to&#13;
strengthen the relationship between budgeting and planning functions, the Public Sector&#13;
Modernization component includes a subcomponent to strengthen the analytic and&#13;
institutional capacities of SGP to carry out its investment planning function. Thus, while the&#13;
previous component will clarify and strengthen the framework within which the investment&#13;
planning function feeds into the budget function, this component will strengthen SGP's&#13;
technical capacities. This will be accomplished via a twinning arrangement in which SGP&#13;
will avail itself of the experience and expertise of Chile's Ministry of Planning&#13;
(MIDEPLAN).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                         Technical Annex&#13;
73. Subcomponent 2: Restructuring and Management Strengthening This subcomponent&#13;
consists in three clusters of activities: (a) developing a national decentralization plan; (b)&#13;
undertaking a public employee census; and (c) restructuring public entities.&#13;
74. A national decentralization plan will be developed through the hiring of consultants to&#13;
advise the Government and assist in the drafting of new decentralization policies and required&#13;
legal instruments. This work will build on the decentralization policy identified at an earlier&#13;
stage in the project under Component 3.&#13;
75. A quadrennial comprehensive public employment census will be undertaken to&#13;
complement the central government personnel monitoring capacities being strengthened under&#13;
the Public Financial Management and Control Component of this project.&#13;
76. Restructuring of public entities will be accomplished via six interrelated sets of activities:&#13;
(i) strengthening SENDA's capacity to oversee and guide the restructuring process as&#13;
described above; (ii) designing the overall strategy for restructuring and management&#13;
strengthening along the lines described below; (iii) establishing the restructuring norms to&#13;
govern the negotiation of Institutional Restructuring Agreements along the lines described&#13;
below; (iv) updating the legal framework so that it is consistent with the enhanced&#13;
restructuring and management strengthening strategy described below; (v) implementing&#13;
public entity restructurings by (a) providing technical assistance to public entities to enable&#13;
them to prepare detailed restructuring proposals, and (b) providing financing and technical&#13;
assistance to public entities to enable them to execute those restructuring agreements that&#13;
have been approved by CONAM, in coordination with SENDA; and (vi) monitoring and&#13;
evaluating the restructuring process. A detailed explanation of this restructuring strategy&#13;
may be found in Attachment 1. In addition, Table 4 provides a summary of the anticipated&#13;
implementation costs per restructuring entity for prototype public entities (small, medium and&#13;
large).&#13;

29                          Technical Annex&#13;
77. Subcomponent 3: Coordination of Public Sector Training To meet the requirements&#13;
of the Modernization of the State initiative in Ecuador a training framework appropriate to&#13;
the proposed technical assistance has been developed targeted to key offices in the central&#13;
government. A comprehensive training plan would be implemented under the Modernization&#13;
of the State Technical Assistance project as follows: Component I, Public Financial&#13;
Management and Control, will focus on all aspects of budgetary preparation, planning, public&#13;
investment and credit, treasury and accounting, audit of public resources, and public&#13;
contracting. Component II, Public Sector Modernization, involves training personnel within&#13;
SGP in modern planning methodologies, monitoring and evaluation techniques, and&#13;
strengthening the coordination of public sector training. Under the concept of training the&#13;
trainers, all governmental personnel receiving training under the project would in turn&#13;
transfer their newly acquired knowledge to their respective departments and divisions in the&#13;
central government for replication in existing training programs.&#13;
78. The training prepared will require effective coordination by SENDA with the objective&#13;
of avoiding duplication and promoting the institutionalization of training activities within the&#13;
respective training units involved in the project.&#13;
79. Public Financial Management and Control Component: The Budget System. (a)&#13;
Objective: Training under the project is intended to increase the analytical capacity to&#13;
interpret the budgetary process; develop the capacity to formulate budgetary policies; provide&#13;
the framework for developing implementation strategies to apply the new Budget Law. (b)&#13;
Capacity Gap. Staff within the Budgeting Office lack the necessary information and skills to&#13;
carry out the new Budget Law. Moreover, there has been a dramatic attrition of staff that&#13;
contributes to the need for a timely and efficient development of the capacity to fulfill the&#13;
key role envisaged under the new Budget Law for the Secretariat of the Budget and the&#13;
respective offices. (c) Training and Phasing: Training would be provided in pedagogical&#13;
techniques to transmit the necessary knowledge envisaged for the curriculum. Students would&#13;
be selected according to level of responsibility for overseeing expenditure flows, compiling&#13;
information, operational personnel, advisors, and other professional staff.&#13;
80. Public Financial Management and Control Component: Control. Objective: To strengthen&#13;
the ability of CGE to carry out its accounting and auditing responsibilities within the&#13;
framework of the new Budget Law and the MOS initiative. Capacity Gap: There is a need&#13;
to strengthen concurrent, posterior, and management control, as well as to implement the&#13;
intended move away from all prior control activities by the CGE. There are also&#13;
fundamental changes contemplated in government auditing and public sector contracting that&#13;
will require intensive training, as reflected in the new Public Contracting Law. Training and&#13;
Phasing: The Training School within Contraloria will be strengthened to provide required&#13;
updating of auditing and accounting skills as well as to provide instruction on the&#13;
implications of legal changes that affect the way Contraloria carries out its mandate within&#13;
the MOS program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30                          Technical Annex&#13;
81. Public Financial Management and Control Component: Informatics Subcomponent:&#13;
Objective. To set up a bridging system to implement the Budget Law and to facilitate other&#13;
aspects of the MOS program. Capacity Gap. Currently, there is no information network for&#13;
providing the necessary flow of budgetary and planning information required for the timely&#13;
and effective implementation of national economic policies and programs. Training and&#13;
Phasing: The informatics training program is scheduled for the five project years. It will be&#13;
implemented in stages and focus on training users in financial systems applications. It is&#13;
included for all components under the project.&#13;
82. Public Sector Modernization Component - Strengthening of the Planning Framework.&#13;
Objective. To strengthen the capacity of the Planning Office (SGP) in technical, strategic and&#13;
management planning to support the objectives of the Modernization of the State relative to&#13;
the implementation of the Ley de Presupuestos. Capacity Gap. The critical mass of experts&#13;
in SGP has been cut in half as a consequence of attrition and poorly handled downsizing.&#13;
Currently, there is a lack of capacity to provide an adequate national planning framework in&#13;
terms of macro programming, evaluating and scheduling of public investments, and&#13;
evaluation of planning proposal. Training and Phasing: The target population for this&#13;
training would be managers and professionals in SGP responsible for all aspects of national&#13;
planning as well as technical personnel, including: (a) general sectoral specialists; (b)&#13;
planners; and (c) technical specialists in the planning and investment group. Initially,&#13;
training would take the form of a twinning arrangement with MIDEPLAN of Chile. Trainers&#13;
would then be trained to implement the knowledge gained from this experience. SGP staff in&#13;
Quito and selected municipalities would be the beneficiaries. Candidates would be selected&#13;
based on their area of specialization and formal preparation for their assignments. Sectoral&#13;
specialist training would be carried out by external consultants in the areas of educational&#13;
infrastructure, health, physical infrastructure, public works engineers, etc.&#13;
83. Public Sector Modernization Component - Restructuring and Management Strengthening.&#13;
Objective: To strengthen SENDA in its efforts to carry out its public sector rationalization&#13;
responsibilities and to coordinate public sector training, especially that directed toward the&#13;
objective of the Modernization of the State. Capacity Gap: Currently there is a lack of&#13;
norms for SENDA to carry out its mandate under the MOS initiative for the reorganization&#13;
and decentralization of the public sector. Moreover, there is an absence of standard&#13;
administrative operating procedures, which falls within SENDA's responsibility.&#13;
Additionally, there is a need to promulgate information about SENDA's legal mandate under&#13;
MOS. Many training courses are conducted throughout the public sector without coordination&#13;
between entities and agencies and with ensuing duplication and no way to gauge their&#13;
effectiveness. SENDA confronts numerous constraints that will need to be addressed before it&#13;
can fulfill its role as coordinator of public sector training. Moreover, facilities and&#13;
equipment are generally inadequate to carry out training effectively in most public agencies.&#13;
Training and Pha.ving. Training would take place over five years.&#13;
84. Coordination of the Reform Program Component - Project Coordinating Unit: Objective:&#13;
To strengthen the coordinating unit within CONAM to facilitate project implementation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31                          Technical Annex&#13;
supervision. Capacity Gap. The liaison between the project unit in CONAM has been&#13;
considerably improved by the appointment of an executive director and president of the&#13;
Commission. However, the link between the technical coordinators and their respective&#13;
agencies' training activities can be improved by providing technical support. Training and&#13;
Phasing: Training would occur in the first year of the project.&#13;
Component III: Coordination of the Reform Program&#13;
85. Objectives: The specific objectives of this component would be to ensure sustainability,&#13;
efficiency and transparency in the carrying out of the public sector reform activities&#13;
supported by the project. These objectives would be achieved through five subcomponents:&#13;
(i) definition of the role of the state; (ii) decentralization policy; (iii) dissemination; (iv)&#13;
project accounts and audit; and (v) project management.&#13;
86. Subcomponent 1: Definition of the Role of the State The Government's&#13;
modernization efforts entail a profound reorientation for the role of the state from one based&#13;
on large scale intervention in the markets to a model that relies on the private sector as the&#13;
main actor in the pursuit of social and economic development, to be achieved through&#13;
privatization of public enterprises and deregulation. But this also requires a redefinition of&#13;
the residual role of the state in society and to make the state more effective and efficient in&#13;
performing that subsidiary role. To address these concerns, the project would include&#13;
resources to support the following activities:&#13;
(a) an analysis of relevant pieces of legislation on Modernization of the State and any&#13;
other existing legislation related to macro-institutional policy to determine their&#13;
internal congruence and consistency with modem public management needs and, the&#13;
consequent formulation of a draft macro-institutional policy consistent with the&#13;
desired new role of the state that emerges from that analysis, and the stated&#13;
objectives of the Government's program;&#13;
(b) a development of a system of popular consultation on the measures and objectives of&#13;
the draft macro-institutional policy reflecting revised role of the state, including a&#13;
forum witlh the participation of prominent citizens reflecting diverse segments of&#13;
Ecuadoran society, such as the Foro de la Ciudadania, as well as gathering other&#13;
ideas and suggestions on the subject; and&#13;
(c) the reformulation of the draft macro-institutional policy on the basis of these&#13;
comments and suggestions for formal sanction of the new role and nature of the state&#13;
sought and the policy and institutional reforms and legislative measures to be&#13;
followed to attain it.&#13;
87. Subcomponent 2: Decentralization Policy One of the three main pillars of the MOS&#13;
initiative is the decentralization of the public sector. At present, local government in&#13;
Ecuador, besides being inadequately financed and staffed to meet the needs of the populations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                          Technical Annex&#13;
they are to serve, is fragmented with layer upon layer of levels of organizational&#13;
responsibility. Despite the abundance of agencies at the central and local levels, financial&#13;
resources allotted to the local level are inadequate and local participation in decision-making&#13;
in their allocation is very limited. Furthermore, in the last forty years many new&#13;
municipalities and provinces have been created. As a result of the prevailing fragmentation,&#13;
it is estimated that 77.5 per cent of the municipalities do not meet the minimum population&#13;
requirement established in the Municipal Law. In summary, the resulting situation is one of&#13;
inadequate institutional capability at the local level, fragmentation of efforts, functional&#13;
superposition and lack of inter-sectoral coordination.&#13;
88. The proposed loan would support CONAM in formulating a decentralization policy to&#13;
address these issues through the provision of technical assistance for the following activities:&#13;
(a) an analysis of the various existing legislative decentralization proposals and any&#13;
relevant studies on decentralization and regionalization, including consultations with&#13;
provincial and municipal authorities to elicit their views on current problems related&#13;
to decentralization and suggestions for their solutions leading to the formulation of a&#13;
draft decentralization policy consistent with the desired new role of the state;&#13;
(b) a workshop including national and international experts in decentralization to discuss&#13;
the draft policy in light of lessons from the experience of other countries that have&#13;
undertaken decentralization efforts;&#13;
(c) a revision of the draft decentralization policy on the basis of these comments and&#13;
suggestions for final sanction by the Government.&#13;
89. Subcomponent 3: Dissemination The Government relies on public support for the&#13;
success of its reform efforts. To gain such support, it is important that the public at large&#13;
understand ex-ante the objectives and expected benefits to be gained from the carrying out of&#13;
its modernization program. The project includes a dissemination and public relations&#13;
program aimed at explaining in detail the specific administrative and legislative initiatives to&#13;
be supported by the proposed loan.&#13;
90. Subcomponent 4: Project Accounts and Audit Although the project would include&#13;
support for strengthening and redefining the role of the CGE, consistent with CGE's new&#13;
role, it is expected that the project accounts would be audited by private external auditors on&#13;
an annual basis. The proposed loan would finance the cost of hiring these external auditors&#13;
during project execution.&#13;
91. Subcomponent 5: Project Management Overall project management and coordination&#13;
would be the responsibility of CONAM, based on its mandate under the MOS Law. A&#13;
Project Working Group, comprising one agency coordinator from each of the agencies&#13;
responsible for implementation of specific activities--MFCP, SENDA, SGP, CGE and BCE&#13;
would be chaired by the Technical Coordinator for the Project in CONAM and would be&#13;
responsible for coordinating day-to-day project implementation and monitoring. Each&#13;
Agencv Coordinator would be appointed by the head of the respective agency. Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33                         Technical Annex&#13;
administration would be carried out by a small group headed by the Administrative&#13;
Coordinator in CONAM. Policy decisions would be made by the Executive Director of&#13;
CONAM, who is appointed by the President.&#13;
92. The Coordination of the Reform Program Component of the proposed loan would&#13;
finance:&#13;
(a) project management and coordination, covering the remuneration the Technical&#13;
Coordinator and the members of the Working Group, including the Administrative&#13;
and Informatics Coordinators;&#13;
(b) administrative support for the project, covering clerical, secretarial and other&#13;
operating expenses of the project office;&#13;
(c) equipment for project management, including office equipment, computers and&#13;
software required by the project's administrative unit in CONAM and by the Agency&#13;
Coordinators in their respective agencies;&#13;
SECTION B: PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Organization and Implementation.&#13;
93. Overall responsibility for project coordination and execution rests with CONAM, and&#13;
will be undertaken primarily by the Project Working Group. Because of the variety of&#13;
entities benefiting from the project, responsibility for executing each subcomponent will rest&#13;
with a specific core executing agency. In addition, within subcomponents, subsets of&#13;
activities may require actions by other entities. Final responsibility for seeing that those&#13;
activities are properly executed will rest with the core executing agency responsible for the&#13;
subcomponent, who will coordinate the activities of any subsidiary entities involved in&#13;
execution of that subcomponent. The following "Project Implementation Responsibilities"&#13;
table identifies the assignment of primary responsibility to core executing agencies by&#13;
subcomponent of the project. That table also identifies the additional entities whose activities&#13;
within each subcomponent will be coordinated by the core executing agency responsible for&#13;
that subcomponent.&#13;
94. A Project Administrative Manual in the Project Files provides guidelines for all&#13;
administrative aspects of project implementation.&#13;
95. Regular reporting of project performance would be essential to assure timely&#13;
implementation. Given the extent of proposed institutional changes, the scope of inter-related&#13;
project activities, and the number of ministries and agencies involved in the implementation&#13;
and execution of the Project, active monitoring would be crucial and is planned.&#13;

98. All project implementation agencies would submit quarterly (status as of end of March,&#13;
June, September and December) progress reports to the Project Administrative Unit in&#13;
CONAM in accordance to a standardized format acceptable to the Bank. The Project&#13;
Administrative Unit would consolidate these reports and forward a consolidated report to the&#13;
Bank a month after the end of the quarter. The December 31 version of the Report, to be&#13;
submitted at the end of January, would include a proposed Annual Operating Plan for the&#13;
following calendar year, to be discussed with the Supervision mission to be scheduled around&#13;
end-January or early February.&#13;
99. Mid-term Review. A project Mid-term Review is tentatively scheduled for November&#13;
30, 1996 to provide a major review of the progress made and to allow a forum to identify&#13;
and discuss any required adjustments and revisions to the Project.&#13;
Procurement.&#13;
100.   Procurement actions will be undertaken in accord with the norms specified in the&#13;
Memorandum of the President (Report No. P-6452-EC).&#13;
Disbursements, Accounts and Audits.&#13;
101.   Disbursements, maintenance of project accounts and project audits will be&#13;
undertaken in accord with the norms specified in the Memorandum of the President (Report&#13;
No. P-6452-EC), the Project Administrative Manual and the Project Plan of Accounts.&#13;
Supervision Plan.&#13;
102.   Given the institutional complexity of this project, its interrelated nature, and the&#13;
need to ensure compliance with time schedules for each individual sub-component, and the&#13;
large number of small consultant contracts and training events, project supervision will&#13;
require the allocation of significant resources, especially in its early years of implementation.&#13;
The acquisition of the integrated information system, also concentrated in the first year of&#13;
project execution, will also require intensive supervision to ensure a smooth procurement&#13;
process. The high supervision inputs presented below provide high allocations during the&#13;
initial years to ensure a smooth and efficient start to project execution, and also in FY97 to&#13;
ensure a smooth adjustment due to the political transition period expected in Ecuador.&#13;

103.   IBRD Supervision Input. Bank staff or consultant supervision inputs are expected to&#13;
range from 36 staff weeks per year for the first two years of project execution to 22 staff&#13;
weeks per year during the latter years, as per the following tasks:&#13;
(a) General Portfolio Management Operations: Review of routine procurement and&#13;
consultant contracting documents, progress reports, correspondence, restructuring&#13;
agreements, participation agreements, etc. and the internal requirements to process&#13;
these requests are expected to require about 12 staff weeks during the initial two&#13;
years of project execution, declining to about 6 staff weeks during the latter years.&#13;
(b) Informatics System Procurement: Review of the informatics plan, procurement&#13;
documentation for acquisition of the informatics system, and subsequent monitoring&#13;
of system installation etc. is expected to require about 6 staff weeks in the first year&#13;
of project execution, declining to about 2 staff weeks thereafter.&#13;
(c) Mid-Term Review: The Mid-Term Review, scheduled for FY1997 would require 8&#13;
weeks (including time for preparation, implementation and follow-up to the review&#13;
by a project team).&#13;
(d) Supervision Missions. Approximately two supervision missions would be necessary&#13;
annually. Each mission would be on average for a period of two weeks, and would&#13;
be comprised of the task manager and about three or four other specialists (possibly&#13;
consultants). Supervision missions, including time for preparation and follow-up,&#13;
are expected to require about 20 staff weeks during the first year of the project,&#13;
declining to about 14 staff weeks thereafter. A proposed schedule for supervision&#13;
missions is provided below.&#13;

Executive Summary&#13;
Institutional Restructuring Guidelines&#13;
1.    Objective (Meta)&#13;
The objective of the restructuring process is to reduce the costs and enhance the&#13;
performance of public entities within the Central Government of Ecuador by rewarding individual&#13;
public entities that reduce unnecessary personnel on a selective basis with enhanced salaries,&#13;
greater direct control over the execution of their budget decisions, and strengthened capacity to&#13;
plan and manage their own resources, in exchange for their providing greater financial and service&#13;
delivery accountability, reducing personnel costs by discharging unnecessary personnel, divesting&#13;
unproductive assets and undertaking steps to ensure that these changes are sustained beyond the&#13;
life of the restructuring process.&#13;
The process is designed to ensure both fiscal savings to the Government and enhanced&#13;
management capacities within public entities that successfully pass through the restructuring&#13;
process. This process encompasses the following specific objectives:&#13;
1. Administrative Objective&#13;
* By the end of the current Government, the 14 Central Government's Ministries, and&#13;
some of the administratively dependent agencies, will have restructured under this&#13;
program and, by achieving this, their personnel will be governed by the revised salary&#13;
scale.&#13;
2. Human Resources Objectives&#13;
*  Achieve a net reduction in Central Government employment by August of 1996 of&#13;
approximately 20,000 public servants, of those currently working, representing an&#13;
overall reduction since August of 1992 of 14%.&#13;
*  Dedicate up to a maximum of 80% of the salary savings achieved through employment&#13;
reductions within any given restructured entity to enhancement of the salaries of the&#13;
remaining employees within that entity.&#13;
3. Financing Objectives&#13;
*  Achieve a fiscal dividend for the Treasury of at least 20% of the cost savings achieved&#13;
through personnel reductions&#13;
*  Each public entity undertaking a sanctioned restructuring will self-finance a portion of&#13;
the severance payment liabilities incurred by its employment reductions, which&#13;
percentage will be negotiated between that entity and the Ministry of Finance as part&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
of the Institutional Restructuring Agreement (Convenio de Reestructuraci6n&#13;
Institucional (CRI)) required by that process. These public entities will accomplish&#13;
this self-financing through the divestment of assets and through cost-savings achieved&#13;
through the employment reductions they attain.&#13;
* Each public entity undertaking a sanctioned restructuring will self-finance the salary&#13;
enhancements for its post-restructuring employees from the personnel cost-savings&#13;
achieved through its employment reductions. The magnitude of the salary&#13;
enhancement costs plus the self-financing of severance payment liabilities from&#13;
personnel cost-savings shall not exceed 80% of the personnel cost-savings achieved&#13;
through the individual public entity's employment reductions. These percentages will&#13;
be defined, in each case, jointly by the entity and CONAM previous to the signing the&#13;
CRI.&#13;
I.    Strategy&#13;
The restructuring process will include two basic elements:&#13;
A.    Planning and Execution of Convenio de Reestructuraci6n Institucional (CRI)&#13;
1.    Process to access to a CRI&#13;
Step 1: Preparation of a the restructuring proposal&#13;
* The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFCP) budget allocation unit will determine the&#13;
proceeds that will be assigned to finance the Institutional Restructuring Program, with the&#13;
indication of the amount to which periodically may be available to and will be used in the&#13;
benefit of the entities identified by CONAM. For this purpose an agreement will be signed by&#13;
WCP and CONAM.&#13;
* Public entity develops a detailed proposal for its participation in a Convenio de&#13;
Reestructuraci6n Institucional (CRI), on the basis of the Institutional Restructuring guidelines&#13;
preestablished by SENDA. This proposal must include a Restructuring Financial Plan (REP).&#13;
The proposal is reviewed by SENDA and if it meets the requisites, it is approved by CONAM.&#13;
* CONAM signs the CRI with the entity.&#13;
*  The Sistema Integrado de Gestion Financiera (SIGEF) shall maintain through its subsystem of&#13;
budgetary execution the information related to the budgetary assignments done. The&#13;
Modernization Computerized Monitoring System, through the information that it receives&#13;
from the entities will register the grade of advance or delay within the process.&#13;
Step 2: Implementation of a CRI&#13;
* Public entity implements its CRI once approved.&#13;
* Implementation of the administrative aspects of the CRI is monitored and technical assistance&#13;
is provided to the restructuring entity by SENDA, in accord with the RSG.&#13;
* MFCP reviews reclassification and its attendant salary changes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
* Once reclassification is approved by MFCP, new salary scale is applied to reclassified&#13;
positions.&#13;
2.a.   Reclassification&#13;
*  For a proposed reclassification to be approved by the Government, it must both be consistent&#13;
with the post-restructuring employment requirements identified in the CRI and provide the&#13;
Government with a sustainable fiscal dividend equal to no less than 20% of the savings&#13;
achieved through employment reductions.&#13;
*  The remaining cost savings achieved through employment reductions shall qualify the&#13;
restructured entity for salary enhancement for its post-restructuring employees and for self-&#13;
financing of the severance payment liabilities incurred through the employment reduction&#13;
instruments.&#13;
2.b.   Valuation and sale of unproductive assets&#13;
*  Each public entity undergoing a restructuring, shall identify their unproductive assets and&#13;
obtain fair market value appraisals. Should such an entity hire or contract a specialized firm to&#13;
obtain the appraisals, this hiring/contracting will be the responsibility of that entity.&#13;
*  The sale process of the unproductive assets will be subject to the general dispositions of the&#13;
Modernization of the State Law and its General Regulations for the sale of unproductive&#13;
assets.&#13;
*  The proceeds from the divestment of assets, independently from when it occurs, will be&#13;
credited by the entity in the Account of the T4reasury of the Government of the Republic of&#13;
Ecuador, in all the correspondent cases of Central Government.&#13;
B.    Financing of Restructurings and Their Impacts&#13;
It is estimated that the severance payment liabilities that will be incurred through the&#13;
voluntary retirement of 20,000 additional public employees during the restructuring process&#13;
mandated by the Modernization of the State Law will total approximately US$195.5 million in&#13;
present value terms. This estimate illustrates the need to establish a strategy and detailed&#13;
financing plan for the restructuring process to ensure that adequate financing will exist to liquidate&#13;
these liabilities. The magnitude of this anticipated liability underscores, in addition, the&#13;
impossibility of financing these costs without recourse to fiscal instruments, such as bonds or&#13;
loans, that create multiyear budgetary obligations. This is one of the key objectives of the&#13;
Restructuring Financing Plan within the CRI proposed in this document. In short, the agreements&#13;
reached in these Financing Plans will create budgetary obligations, not only for the years in which&#13;
severance payment liabilities are incurred, but also over the entire time period required to finance&#13;
those liabilities, which period will be specified in the Financing Plan.&#13;
The body of this document presents a simulation model developed to facilitate the&#13;
preparation of Restructuring Financing Plans for individual public entities proposing to restructure&#13;
under a CRI. This document presents and explains the results of applying this simulation model&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
with data reflecting the overall personnel reductions and salary increments which the Central&#13;
Govermnent expects to attain through the Restructuring Program through August of 1996.&#13;
This simulation model, consistent with the strategy proposed in this document, anticipates&#13;
self-financing on the part of the individual public entities undergoing restructuring of&#13;
approximately 55% of the severance payment liabilities, as well as of salary enhancements of&#13;
approximately 75% of the personnel expenditure savings expected to be achieved through&#13;
employment reductions. These simulations project a fiscal dividend to the Treasury from this&#13;
restructuring process with a net present value of approximately US$81.4 million, less roughly&#13;
US$25.0 million in costs anticipated to implement the Modernization of the State program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Institutional Restructuring Guidelines&#13;
1.    Modernization of the State Policy&#13;
Since the beginning of the Duran-Ballen Administration, in August of 1992, its policy has&#13;
aimed at macroeconomic stability and reorganization and enhanced efficiency of the public sector.&#13;
These improvements have been viewed as prerequisites for sustained economic growth and a&#13;
more equitable distribution of resources, especially for the most disadvantaged elements of the&#13;
population.&#13;
These objectives are incorporated in a process of modernization of the State, which seeks&#13;
a thoroughgoing transformation of the organization, interrelation and function of the Public&#13;
Administration. The strategy to achieve these ends includes a dramatic change relative to the&#13;
policies in force during the 1970's and 1980's. The new strategy is based on the promotion of&#13;
and interaction with the private sector in a competitive environment, jointly with State actions to&#13;
facilitate development and to promote private sector activities.&#13;
This transformation is expected to result from an appropriate redefinition of the size and&#13;
role of the State, with the objective of achieving a smaller but stronger public administration,&#13;
capable and governable, sustained on the pillars of efficiency, rationality and administrative&#13;
decentralization, in order to achieve effective management, as well as timely allocation and&#13;
efficient utilization of public resources.&#13;
Since the beginning of the Administration of President Sixto Duran-Ballen, the&#13;
Government has undertaken a number of steps to establish a solid basis upon which to achieve a&#13;
fundamental reorganization of Ecuador's public administration. Among the more important of&#13;
these achievements are the following:&#13;
* Definition of the legal framework for the modernization of the State, through&#13;
enactment of the Modernization of the State, Privatization and Provision of Public&#13;
Services Law (LMOS: R.O. N° 349 of 31 December 1993), its General Regulation&#13;
(R.O. N° 411 of 31 March 1994), and the Public Budgets Law (Law N° 18,&#13;
Supplement of the R.O. N° 76, of 30 November 1992).&#13;
* Rationalization of the structure of four Central Government entities, each of which has&#13;
been incorporated in the new salary scale.&#13;
* Issuance of preliminary policy guidelines for the reclassification of salaries and their&#13;
grades within the salary scale, which require as preconditions for access to those&#13;
enhanced salaries: reductions in personnel in the qualifying public entities; that salary&#13;
increases so occasioned result in personnel cost increases that are less than the&#13;
personnel cost savings achieved by personnel reductions; enhancements in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
administrative efficiency; and the divestment of unproductive assets equal in value to&#13;
at least three times the personnel cost increases due to salary enhancement.&#13;
* A reduction of 3 1,000 public employees between August 9, 1992 and September&#13;
1994, which represents an 8.5% reduction relative to the August 1992 level of&#13;
365,000 public employees.&#13;
* Emission of a Ministerial Accord by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit on&#13;
January 13, 1994, which various grades and basic salaries in the Public Employees&#13;
Salary Scale, foliowed by a Resolution of the Secretaria Nacional de Desarrollo&#13;
Administrativo (SENDA) of January 27 of that same year, which eliminated a number&#13;
of categories of positions from the Occupational Index incorporated in the Public&#13;
Employees Basic Salary Scale. These changes have significantly improved the salary&#13;
scale, although more improvements are still needed, as is a more systematic set of&#13;
norms to govern such changes.&#13;
* The Government has developed a preliminary draft of the Institutional Restructuring&#13;
Agreement (Convenio de Reestrucuraci6n Institucional (CRI)).&#13;
Legal Framework                           . Modernization of the State Law and Regulation&#13;
. Public Budgets Law&#13;

11.    Fundamental Objectives&#13;
The basic objectives of the restructuring process are to reduce the costs and enhance the&#13;
performance of public entities within the Central Government of Ecuador by rewarding individual&#13;
public entities on a selective basis with enhanced salaries, greater direct control over the execution&#13;
of their budget decisions, and strengthened capacity to plan and manage their own resources, in&#13;
exchange for their providing greater financial and service delivery accountability, reducing&#13;
personnel costs by discharging unnecessary personnel, divesting unproductive assets and&#13;
undertaking steps to ensure that these changes are sustained beyond the life of the restructuring&#13;
process.&#13;
The process is designed to ensure both fiscal savings to the Government and enhanced&#13;
management capacities within public entities that successfully pass through the restructuring&#13;
process. This process encompasses the following specific objectives:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
A.   Administrative Objective&#13;
The principal objective of the administrative rationalization is to optimize the utilization of&#13;
human, financial, material and technological resources in order to effectively and in a timely&#13;
manner meet the demands for the public services provided by the Central Government:&#13;
* By the end of the current Government, the 14 Central Government's Ministries, and&#13;
some of the administratively dependent agencies, will have restructured under this&#13;
program and, by achieving this, their personnel will be governed by the revised salary&#13;
scale.&#13;
B.    Human Resources Objectives&#13;
* Achieve a net reduction in Central Government employment by August of 1996 of&#13;
approximately 20,000 public servants, of those currently working, representing an&#13;
overall reduction since August of 1992 of 14%.&#13;
* Dedicate up to a maximum of 80% of the salary savings achieved through employment&#13;
reductions within any given restructured entity to enhancement of the salaries of the&#13;
remaining employees within that entity.&#13;
C.    Financing Objectives&#13;
To ensure both that restructuring entities face adequate incentives to restructure and that&#13;
the restructuring process will be fiscally viable, the Restructuring Program requires that each&#13;
public entity undertaking to restructure must self-finance a significant portion of the costs&#13;
incurred through that process and provide a fiscal dividend to the Treasury. Costs to be&#13;
financed include severance payments and subsequent salary enhancements. These shall be&#13;
self-financed through divestment of assets and personnel expenditure reductions achieved&#13;
through employment reductions. To this end, the following specific financing objectives are&#13;
set:&#13;
* Achieve a fiscal dividend for the Treasury of at least 20% of the cost savings achieved&#13;
through personnel reductions&#13;
* Each public entity undertaking a sanctioned restructuring will self-finance a portion of&#13;
the severance payment liabilities incurred by its employment reductions, which&#13;
percentage will be negotiated between that entity and the Ministry of Finance as part&#13;
of the Institutional Restructuring Agreement (Convenio de Reestructuraci6n&#13;
Institucional (CRI)) required by that process. These public entities will accomplish&#13;
this self-financing through the divestment of assets and through cost-savings achieved&#13;
through the employment reductions they attain.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
* Each public entity undertaking a sanctioned restructuring will self-finance the salary&#13;
enhancements for its post-restructuring employees from the personnel cost-savings&#13;
achieved through its employment reductions. The magnitude of the salary&#13;
enhancement costs plus the self-financing of severance payment liabilities from&#13;
personnel cost-savings shall not exceed 80% of the personnel cost-savings achieved&#13;
through the individual public entity's employment reductions. These percentages will&#13;
be defined, in each case, jointly by the entity and CONAM previous to the signing the&#13;
CRI.&#13;
These percentages will be defined, in each case, jointly between the entity and CONAM,&#13;
prior to signing the CRI.&#13;
111.   Strategy&#13;
A.    Context&#13;
The administrative restructuring process will be administered by the Secretaria Nacional de&#13;
Desarrollo Administrativo (SENDA). All activities within this Restructuring Program will be in accord&#13;
with the policies and guidelines established by the Consejo Nacional de Modernizaci6n del Estado&#13;
(CONAM), consistent with the strategies and actions for decentralization developed by the Secretaria&#13;
General de Planificaci6n (SGP), in accord with financing requirements established for the Restructuring&#13;
Program and established by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFCP), and consistent with the&#13;
public financial controls established by the Contraloria General del Estado (CGE). Accordingly, the&#13;
restructuring process will be an integrated process that is consistent with all core Central Government&#13;
financial and management policies and practices.&#13;
B.    Implementation Strategy&#13;
To implement this process, a Committee for Development and Technology will be designated&#13;
for each restructuring entity. This Committee will be comprised by a top level official, designated by&#13;
the head of the restructuring entity, the entity's Director of Planning, Director of Human Resources&#13;
and one other official whose functions are related to the reorganization of the entity.&#13;
In order to undertake an administrative restructuring, a public entity must prepare and execute&#13;
an Institutional Restructuring Agreement (Convenio de Reestructuraci6n Institucional (CRI)), subject&#13;
to the approval of CONAM, SENDA and the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit.&#13;
The restructuring process will include two basic elements: planning and execution of&#13;
individual Institutional Restructuring Agreements (Convenio de Reestructuraci6n Institucional --&#13;
or CRI) and financing of each public entity's restructuring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
RELACIONES FUNCIONALES PARA&#13;
LA REESTRUCTURACION&#13;
1 ~&#13;
1.    Planning and Execution of Convenio de Reestructuraci6n Institucional (CRI)&#13;
Planning and execution of the CRIs will involve two steps:&#13;
Step 1: Preparation of a the restructuring proposal&#13;
T the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFCP) budget allocation unit will determine the&#13;
proceeds that will be assigned to finance the Institutional Restructuring Program, with the&#13;
indication of the amount to which periodically may be available to and will be used in the&#13;
benefit of the entities identified by CONAM. For this purpose an agreement will be signed by&#13;
MFCP and CONAM.&#13;
*  Public entity develops a detailed proposal for its participation in a Convenio de&#13;
Reestructuraci6n Institucional (CRI), on the basis of the Institutional Restructuring guidelines&#13;
preestablished by SENDA. This proposal must include a Restructuring Financial Plan (RFP).&#13;
The proposal is reviewed by SENDA and if it meets the requisites, it is approved by CONAM.&#13;
*  CONAM signs the CRI with the entity.&#13;
*  The Sistema Integrado de Gesti6n Financiera (SIGEF) shall maintain through its subsystem of&#13;
budgetary execution the information related to the budgetary assignments done. The&#13;
Modernization Computerized Monitoring System, through the information that it receives&#13;
from the entities will register the grade of advance or delay within the process.&#13;
Step 2: Implementation of a CRI&#13;
* Public entity implements its CRI once approved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
*  CONAM informs MFCP of the signing of a CRI and requires the allocation of the resources&#13;
necessary for execution of the CRI, which must include the Restructuring Financing Plan,&#13;
including its respective Amortization Program.&#13;
*  Implementation of the administrative aspects of the CRI is monitored and technical assistance&#13;
is provided to the restructuring entity by SENDA, in accord with the Institutional&#13;
Restructuring Guidelines.&#13;
*  Monitoring of implementation of each restructuring is accomplished via a SIGEF subsystem&#13;
for Monitoring of the Modernization Process.&#13;
c  NICP transfers the resources required for each CRI to a Special Account opened for the&#13;
purpose within the Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE), which will be drawn upon only through&#13;
payment orders, to which must be attached a copy of the CRI. BCE transfers resources of the&#13;
Special Account to the Current Account of the institution being restructured. Only then will&#13;
the restructuring entity disburse the severance payments incurred.&#13;
*  Once SENDA approves a CRI, it issues the recommendations necessary for approval of the&#13;
reclassification proposal for the entity to MFCP, including an analysis of the fiscal impacts of&#13;
the proposed reclassification.&#13;
*  Once reclassification is approved by MCP, new salary scale is applied to reclassified&#13;
positions.&#13;
2.    Norms&#13;
Execution of these steps will be governed by the following norms:&#13;
a)    Budget Agreement between CONAM and MFCP&#13;
The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit will determine the budgetary resources to be&#13;
assigned to finance the institutional restructuring program, indicating the quantities that will&#13;
periodically be made available for the benefit of entities undertaking to restructure with the&#13;
approval of CONAM. CONAM and MFCP will sign an agreement to effect this arrangement.&#13;
b)    Convenio de Reestructuraci6n Institucional&#13;
Each CRI will be based on a detailed analysis of the objectives, production processes,&#13;
required activities, and resource requirements of the public entity planning to restructure. That&#13;
analysis will be undertaken by said entity, with financial and technical assistance from SENDA,&#13;
which is expected to be financed under the Modernization of the State Technical Assistance&#13;
(MOSTA) project currently being prepared by the Government with the World Bank. That&#13;
detailed analysis will identify:&#13;
* Objectives of the entity, both fundamental and detailed.&#13;
* Activities and procedures required to meet these objectives, by objective.&#13;
*  Organizational structure best adapted to undertaking those activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
* Resources required to undertake those activities -- both physical and human resources.&#13;
* Positions to be eliminated and positions to be created in order to meet the newly identified&#13;
human resource requirements.&#13;
* Financing strategy for achieving the required employment reductions under existing laws,&#13;
including projection and financing (including timing) of salary savings and severance payments&#13;
anticipated and their net present value.&#13;
* Inventory and valuation of assets, and identification of those assets considered to be&#13;
unproductive and to be divested as part of the restructuring process, including a projection of&#13;
the expected proceeds from those divestments by quarter.&#13;
* Fiscal dividends to be achieved by the restructuring.&#13;
* Means by which the performance of the entity in achieving its objectives can be assessed,&#13;
including the mechanisms by which the information required for this assessment will be&#13;
monitored, summarized and made available to the Government.&#13;
Satisfactory execution of a CRI will require:&#13;
* Compliance with the Ley de Presupuestos (cite its full title)&#13;
* Implementation of SIGEF in all executing units and compliance with SIGEF performance&#13;
standards satisfactory to CONAM.&#13;
* Implementation of IRM module of SIGEF and compliance with IRM reporting standards&#13;
satisfactory to CONAM.&#13;
* Implementation of the Sistema Integrado de Administraci6n de Personal (SIAP) and&#13;
compliance with SIAP performance standards satisfactory to SENDA.&#13;
*  Satisfaction of all targets set in the CRI, including but not limited to (a) employment&#13;
reductions, (b) net personnel expenditure reductions, (c) unproductive asset divestments and&#13;
(d) fiscal dividends.&#13;
3 Implementation of the performance monitoring mechanisms specified in the CRI and delivery&#13;
to CONAM of performance monitoring information that is, in the judgment of CONAM,&#13;
satisfactory to permit assessment of the performance of said entity.&#13;
c)    Reclassification&#13;
For a proposed reclassification to be approved by the Government, it must both be&#13;
consistent with the post-restructuring employment requirements identified in the CRI and provide&#13;
the Government with a sustainable fiscal dividend equal to no less than the amount agreed to in&#13;
the CRI. The remaining cost savings achieved through employment reductions shall qualify the&#13;
restructured entity for salary enhancement for its post-restructuring employees. For the purposes&#13;
of calculating both personnel cost savings achieved through employment reductions and salary&#13;
enhancements, all forms of personnel compensation must be included -- including, but not limited&#13;
to, base salaries, benefits, and all forms of salary supplements. The section below on "Financing&#13;
restructurings and their impacts" clarifies the mechanism by which these fiscal dividends and&#13;
salary enhancements will be monitored and enforced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
d)    Valuation and sale of unproductive assets&#13;
Each public entity undergoing a restructuring, shall identify their unproductive assets and&#13;
obtain fair market value appraisals. Should such an entity hire or contract a specialized firm to&#13;
obtain the appraisals, this hiring/contracting will be the responsibility of that entity.&#13;
The sale process of the unproductive assets will be subject to the general dispositions of&#13;
the Modernization of the State Law and its General Regulations for the sale of unproductive&#13;
assets.&#13;
The proceeds from the divestment of assets, independently from when it occurs, will be&#13;
credited by the entity in the Unified Account of the Treasury of the Government of the Republic&#13;
of Ecuador, in all the correspondent cases of Central Government.&#13;
Severance payment liabilities of any given restructuring entity in excess of its capacity to&#13;
finance those by divestment of assets shall be financed from that entity's personnel cost savings&#13;
achieved through employment reductions. Accounting for these financial flows will be&#13;
accomplished through the financing mechanism described below.&#13;
C.    Financing Restructurings and Their Impacts&#13;
It is estimated that the severance payment liabilities that will be incurred through the&#13;
voluntary retirement of 20,000 additional public employees during the restructuring process&#13;
mandated by the Modernization of the State Law will total approximately US$195.5 million in&#13;
present value terms. This estimate illustrates the need to establish a strategy and detailed&#13;
financing plan for the restructuring process to ensure that adequate financing will exist to liquidate&#13;
these liabilities. The magnitude of this anticipated liability underscores, in addition, the&#13;
impossibility of financing these costs without recourse to fiscal instruments, such as bonds or&#13;
loans, that create multiyear budgetary obligations. This is one of the key objectives of the&#13;
Restructuring Financing Plan within the CRI proposed in this document. In short, the agreements&#13;
reached in these Financing Plans will create budgetary obligations, not only for the years in which&#13;
severance payment liabilities are incurred, but also over the entire time period required to finance&#13;
those liabilities, which period will be specified in the Financing Plan.&#13;
This section explains and presents the results of a model developed to simulate and&#13;
project the financing of the employment reductions and salary enhancements the Government&#13;
anticipates achieving through the proposed Public Entity Restructuring Program until August of&#13;
1996. That model reflects the following costs and benefits:&#13;
Costs&#13;
* Voluntary departure severance payments (indemnizaciones)&#13;
* Salary enhancements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Benefits&#13;
* Salary savings&#13;
Administrative costs of undertaking the Public Entity Restructuring program, including&#13;
implementation of its co-requisite Sistema Integrado de Gesti6n Financiera (SIGEF), are not included&#13;
in these projections. Those administrative implementation costs are projected to reach approximately&#13;
US$25.0 million; a magnitude that does not alter the qualitative conclusions of the projected Net&#13;
Present Value of the proposed Public Entity Restructuring program.&#13;
This simulation model, consistent with the strategy proposed in this document, anticipates self-&#13;
financing on the part of the individual public entities undergoing restructuring of approxirnately 55% of&#13;
the severance payment liabilities, as well as of salary enhancements that will cover 75% of the&#13;
persomel expenditure savings expected to be achieved through employment reductions. These&#13;
simulations project a fiscal dividend to the Treasure from this restructuring process with a net present&#13;
value of approximately US$81.4 million, less roughly US$25.0 million in costs anticipated to be needed&#13;
to implement the Modernization of the State Program. Net of those implementation costs, the net&#13;
present value to the Treasury is US$56.4 million. The improved salary savings, coupled with the&#13;
improved management capacities to be achieved through:&#13;
* implementation of the new Ley de Presupuestos, including implementation of both the Sistema&#13;
Integrado de Gestion Financiera (SIGEF) and its affiliated Sistema de Pagos de Red Bancaria&#13;
(PRG), and&#13;
* management improvements to be effected through the restructuring process mandated by the&#13;
Ley de Modernizaci6n and to be implemented through this Public Entity Restructuring&#13;
Strategy,&#13;
promise to significantly enhance the quality of public services and the cost-effectiveness with&#13;
which those services are provided in Ecuador.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
1.    Assumptions&#13;
A number of assumptions were required to make these benefit and cost projections. The&#13;
parameter assumptions employed, as well as the means by which their values will be determined&#13;
for each public entity entering into a Convenio de Reestructuraci6n Institucional (CRI), may be&#13;
found in Attachment 1. These assumptions may be grouped into three broad categories:&#13;
1. Parameters established by the Public Entity Restructuring Strategy (PERS)&#13;
2. Parameters determined through the development and approval of each restructuring&#13;
entity's Convenio de Reestructuraci6n Institucional (CRI)&#13;
3. Exogenously determined parameters&#13;
Parameters to be established by the PERS include:&#13;
*  Percentage of salary savings to be devoted to self-financing of the restructuring&#13;
entity's indemnizaciones and salary enhancements (80% is suggested), and its&#13;
complement, the percentage of salary savings to be devoted to the Government's fiscal&#13;
dividend (20%)&#13;
3  Amortization period for restructuring entity's self-financing its share of severance&#13;
payment costs (4 years is suggested)&#13;
Parameters to be determined through the preparation and approval of each restructuring entity's&#13;
CRI include:&#13;
3 Value of assets to be divested&#13;
3 Personnel reductions&#13;
- Salary enhancement target percentage (i.e., percentage of salary savings targeted for&#13;
enhancing salaries of post-restructuring employees of the restructuring entity) (60% is&#13;
assumed in these simulations)&#13;
Employment reductions expected to be achieved in these simulations reflect targets that&#13;
SENDA authorities have suggested are likely to be reasonable, both for the Government as a&#13;
whole and for the individual Ministries identified in the attached "Cronograma de Acci6n."&#13;
These figures will be revised as each pubic entity formulates its own restructuring proposal under&#13;
the approved guidelines that will govern the restructuring process.&#13;
Exogenous parameters include:&#13;
*  Discount rate (a real discount rate of 15% is assumed in these simulations)&#13;
*  Average salary of departing employees (US$6,561 is assumed, consistent with the&#13;
magnitude of severance payments made during the first months of 1994, as reported&#13;
by the Banco Central de Ecuador (BCE))&#13;
*  Average antiguedad of departing employees (1 I years is assumed)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
*  Average age of departing employees when they first became employed within the&#13;
public sector (30 years is assumed)&#13;
*  Average age at which departing employees would have separated from public sector&#13;
employment in the absence of the Restructuring Program (55 years is assumed)&#13;
*  Minimum salary at time employee departures create severance payment liabilities (the&#13;
current legal minimum salary of 70,000 sucres is assumed)&#13;
*  Exchange rate (2222 sucres per US$ is assumed)&#13;
2.    Projected Implications of the Restructuring Process&#13;
Given these assumptions, the simulation model determines a number of variables, the most&#13;
significant of which are:&#13;
*  Total cost of expected indemnizaciones (Present Value (PV) US$195.5 million for the&#13;
20,000 additional employees expected to depart between September 1994 and&#13;
December 1995; PV US$568.4 million for the full 51,000 employees expected to have&#13;
departed between January 1993 and December 1995)&#13;
*  Severance payment cost per departing employee (US$12,028, which equals the&#13;
average severance payment provided during the first months of 1994, according to&#13;
data provided by BCE)&#13;
*  Value of severance payments expected to be self-financed by restructuring entities&#13;
(PV US$124.1 million of the US$195.5 million of additional indemnizaciones expected&#13;
to be incurred), part of which will be achieved via the sale of assets and the balance by&#13;
annual charges against the entity's salary savings&#13;
*  Fraction of severance payments to be self-financed (55%)&#13;
*  Annual magnitude of self-financing of severance payments from salary savings over&#13;
the four-year amortization period envisioned (ranging between zero and US$55.8&#13;
million)&#13;
*  Annual magnitude of self-financing of salary enhancements by restructuring entities&#13;
(ranging between US$39.4 million and US$78.7 million)&#13;
*  Net present value of the fiscal dividend expected to accrue to the Treasury as a&#13;
consequence of the restructuring process (US$81.4 million less US$25.0 million for&#13;
non-severance payment costs of implementation of the Modernization of the State&#13;
program)&#13;
3.    Key Aspects of the Model&#13;
The model reported herein and summarized in Attachment 1 has the following important&#13;
features, in addition to the assumptions already enumerated above:&#13;
1. The following actions are all assumed to occur during the first four years of the&#13;
restructuring process&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
* all employee departures, and hence the date at which all severance payment liabilities&#13;
are expected to be incurred;&#13;
* all asset divestments&#13;
2. Salary savings from employment reductions are assumed to persist for as many years as&#13;
departed employees could have been expected to have remained employed within the&#13;
public sector in the absence of the Restructuring Program.&#13;
3. All projected future costs and benefits (e.g., salary savings) are fixed in real terms.&#13;
4. The discount rate reflects expected real interest rates in Ecuador (i.e., exclusive of&#13;
inflation), consistent with the projection of future benefits and costs in constant real terms.&#13;
5. Severance payment liabilities are calculated in accord with the formula specified in the Ley&#13;
de Modernizaci6n del Estado, and thereby reflect the anticipated salary levels and&#13;
antiguedad of employees expected to depart under the Restructuring Program.&#13;
6. The fiscal dividend for the Treasury is summarized in net present value terms in order to&#13;
properly combine benefits and costs that occur at different points in time.&#13;
While the simulations reported in Attachment 1 reflect expectations regarding the overall&#13;
Central Government-wide restructuring program, the model can readily be calibrated for specific&#13;
public entities. Due to an absence of data on expected divestments, it was necessary to make an&#13;
arbitrary assumption about those magnitudes when calibrating the model reported in Attachment&#13;
1. It was assumed that divestments would equal 45% of the annual salary reductions achieved&#13;
through reductions in force. This is a modest assumption, which means that the estimated net&#13;
present values reported in this Attachment probably err on the side of understating those net&#13;
benefits.&#13;
IV. Conclusions&#13;
The Public Entity Restructuring Program is designed to provide strong incentives to public&#13;
entities to:&#13;
*  identify precisely what objectives they should design their organization, its activities&#13;
and resources to achieve;&#13;
*  identify and discharge those workers whose functions are no longer required to attain&#13;
the entity's key objectives or whose productivity is inadequate to justify their&#13;
continued employment;&#13;
*  identify and divest those assets that are either unproductive or which impose budgetary&#13;
opportunity costs that could be more effectively incurred for other uses, such as the&#13;
financing of severance payment;&#13;
*  implement the financial management systems mandated by the Ley de Presupuestos;&#13;
*  restructure and reorganize the work flow of their entity so as to most efficiently&#13;
achieve its specific objectives;&#13;
*  provide timely and reliable information on their entity's performance in achieving its&#13;
stated objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
This strategy is also designed to provide a sustainable fiscal dividend to the Treasury of not&#13;
less than a fixed percentage of the personnel expenditure savings achieved through employment&#13;
reductions -- 20% has been suggested in the initial proposal. The fiscal dividend parameter, which&#13;
will be determined by the Government when it finalizes the restructuring strategy, reflects a&#13;
tradeoff that must be made between creating strong incentives for individual public entities to&#13;
undertake productive restructurings and providing the Treasury with a fiscal dividend. More&#13;
specifically, salary savings from retrenchment provide an opportunity to advance two important&#13;
goals of the Government: (i) improve the performance of public entities in delivering specific&#13;
services by allowing them to offer more competitive salaries in order to attract more highly&#13;
qualified employees; and (ii) reap a fiscal dividend, which can be used to ease the pressure on the&#13;
national Treasury. The draft proposal recommends that a high percentage of these savings --&#13;
around 80% -- be dedicated to salary enhancement and financing of required severance payments,&#13;
both because this provides a greater incentive for public entities to identify and phase out those&#13;
workers whose functions are redundant or unnecessary or who are not contributing significantly&#13;
to producing the products for which that entity is responsible, and because, the greater is the&#13;
reduction in personnel, the greater will be the total salary savings, and hence, the fiscal dividend&#13;
available to the Treasury.&#13;
