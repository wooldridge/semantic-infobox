The Little Data Book on Climate Change 2011 is based on the World Develop-&#13;
ment Indicators database. Defining, gathering, and disseminating international&#13;
statistics is a collective effort of many people and organizations. The&#13;
indicators presented in these resources are results of decades of work at&#13;
many levels, from the field workers who administer censuses and household&#13;
surveys to the committees and working parties of the national and interna-&#13;
tional statistical agencies that develop the nomenclature, classifications,&#13;
and standards fundamental to the international statistical system. Non-&#13;
governmental organizations have also made important contributions. We&#13;
are indebted to many external partners as detailed in World Development&#13;
Indicators 2011 who have provided substantial help, guidance, and data.&#13;
&#13;
The Little Data Book on Climate Change 2011 is the result of close collabora-&#13;
tion between the staff of the Development Data Group of the Development&#13;
Economics Vice Presidency (DECDG), the Environment Department of the&#13;
Sustainable Development Vice Presidency (ENV), and the Global Facility for&#13;
Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). Timothy Herzog coordinated the&#13;
production of the book with substantial contributions from Philippe Ambrosi,&#13;
Ana Bucher, and Fernanda Zermoglio from ENV, Milen Dyoulgerov and Ian&#13;
Noble from GFDRR, and William Prince from DECDG. Additional support was&#13;
provided by Azita Amjadi, Federico Escaler, Mahyar Eshragh-Tabary, Neil&#13;
Fantom, Tariq Khokhar, Alison Kwong, and Sup Lee, from DECDG; Sameer&#13;
Akbar, Jane Ebinger, Fernando Loayza, Elisabeth Mealey, Kiran Pandey, Kanta&#13;
Kumari Rigaud, and Sari Soderstrom from ENV; Daniel Hoornweg and Marcus&#13;
Lee from Financial Solutions Group; Roshin Joseph, and Ayaz Parvez from&#13;
GFDRR; Richard Damania from the Latin America and the Caribbean Region&#13;
(LAC); and Gabriela Elizondo Azuela from the Sustainable Energy Department&#13;
(SEGEN). The bookâ&#128;&#153;s design is done by Jomo Tariku and is based on an&#13;
original design by Communications Development Incorporated. Staff from&#13;
External Affairs consisting of Stephen McGroarty, Dina Towbin, and Nora&#13;
Ridolfi oversaw publication and distribution of the book. The book was&#13;
prepared under supervision of Shaida Badiee, director of the Development&#13;
Data Group; Mary Barton-Dock, director of Environment; and Andrew Steer,&#13;
Special Envoy for Climate Change.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                      Foreword&#13;
When President Robert Zoellick launched the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Open Data&#13;
Initiative in April 2010, he said its purpose was to â&#128;&#156;open the treasure&#13;
chest of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s data and knowledge to every village, to everyone&#13;
everywhere.â&#128;? This small book and the much bigger open database behind&#13;
it are part of this same goal.&#13;
&#13;
Solving the problem of climate change requires that our behavior changes.&#13;
Whether this happens depends on our understanding, which, in turn, depends&#13;
upon our knowledge of facts and their implications. Access to freely available&#13;
climate and climate-related data is essential to catalyze the changes in&#13;
policies, investments, and technologies that will be needed if we are to&#13;
move toward a climate-smart future.&#13;
&#13;
The Little Data Book on Climate Change includes a diverse set of indi-&#13;
cators selected from the global economic and scientific communities. These&#13;
indicators recognize the intrinsic relationship between climate change and&#13;
development and attempt to synthesize important aspects of current and&#13;
projected climate conditions, exposure to climate impacts, resilience,&#13;
greenhouse gas emissions, and the current state of efforts to take action.&#13;
While these indicators are from standard sources and represent professional&#13;
consensus, many are subject to considerable uncertainties, and the usual&#13;
care must be taken in their interpretation.&#13;
&#13;
The Little Data Book on Climate Change draws upon several online resources,&#13;
including the Open Data website,1 the Climate Change Knowledge Portal,2&#13;
and the Open Data for Resilience initiative.3 These resources from the World&#13;
Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)&#13;
provide free and open access to data and information relevant to climate&#13;
risk, climate change, and development at the international, national and&#13;
subnational levels. These resources contain many more indicators than&#13;
are available in the limited space of this book and include interactive tools,&#13;
visualizations on the use and interpretation of the data. In addition, there&#13;
are other tools that will help users and programmers access World Bank&#13;
data and develop applications.&#13;
&#13;
We invite you to visit the online companions to the Little Data Book on Climate&#13;
Change. In the coming months, we will continue to add to the datasets. We&#13;
welcome suggestions on how we can improve these resources for everyone.&#13;

The indicators in the Little Data Book on Climate Change are organized into&#13;
the following categories, each of which relates to climate change, development,&#13;
and the intrinsic relationship between the two. For additional information,&#13;
refer to the definitions of each indicator in the Glossary.&#13;
&#13;
     Climate includes data on current and projected future average climate&#13;
     conditions, particularly precipitation and temperature.&#13;
&#13;
     Exposure to Impacts includes data that suggest the degree to which a&#13;
     country or region may be exposed to changes in the prevailing climate&#13;
     and natural environment, with potential impacts on human health, food&#13;
     security, water supply, and physical infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
     Resilience includes data on the capacity of human systems to cope with&#13;
     the impacts of climate change, such as economic capacity, institutional&#13;
     capacity, and extent of public infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
     GHG Emissions and Energy Use includes data on the emissions of&#13;
     greenhouse gases (GHG), energy use, including measures of energy&#13;
     efficiency and carbon intensity of economy.&#13;
&#13;
     National-Level Actions includes data that summarize actions being&#13;
     taken to address and respond to climate change at the national and&#13;
     international levels. Additional information is included in the â&#128;&#156;Summary&#13;
     of National Actionsâ&#128;? tables in the appendices.&#13;
&#13;
     Carbon Markets includes data that summarize project activities under&#13;
     Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism, two of the&#13;
     flexibility mechanisms set forth under the Kyoto Protocol.&#13;
&#13;
The data in this book are for the most recent year available. Regional&#13;
aggregates include data for low- and middle-income economies only. No&#13;
aggregate is calculated if missing data exceed specific thresholds by&#13;
indicator. See Statistical methods in World Development Indicators 2011&#13;
for more information.&#13;
&#13;
Symbols used:&#13;
&#13;
     0 or 0.0     indicates zero or small enough that the number rounds to&#13;
                  zero at the displayed number of decimal places.&#13;
&#13;
            ..    indicates that data are not available.&#13;
&#13;
n/a or blank      indicates not applicable, or for an aggregate, not analytically&#13;
                  meaningful.&#13;
&#13;
            $     indicates current U.S. dollars.&#13;
&#13;
Data are shown for economies with populations greater than 30,000 or for&#13;
smaller economies if they are members of the World Bank. This publication&#13;
also includes three additional economies: Cook Islands, Nauru, and Niue.&#13;
The word country (used interchangeably with economy) does not imply&#13;
political independence or official recognition by the World Bank but refers&#13;
to any economy for which the authorities report separate social or economic&#13;
statistics.&#13;
&#13;
The cutoff date for data was October 21, 2011.&#13;

&amp;#12;Income &amp; other group tables&#13;
For operational and analytical purposes, the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s main criterion&#13;
for classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Each&#13;
economy in The Little Data Book on Climate Change is classified as low&#13;
income, middle income, or high income. Low- and middle-income economies&#13;
are sometimes referred to as developing economies. The use of the term is&#13;
convenient; it is not intended to imply that all economies in the group are&#13;
experiencing similar development or that other economies have reached a&#13;
preferred or final stage of development. Classification by income does not&#13;
necessarily reflect development status.&#13;
&#13;
Note: Classifications are fixed during the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal year (ending on&#13;
June 30). Thus, countries remain in the categories in which they are classified&#13;
irrespective of any revisions to their per capita income data.&#13;
&#13;
Low-income economies are those with a 2010 GNI per capita of $1,005&#13;
or less.&#13;
&#13;
Middle-income economies are those with a 2010 GNI per capita of more&#13;
than $1,006 but less than $12,276. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-&#13;
income economies are separated at a 2010 GNI per capita of $3,975.&#13;
&#13;
High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $12,276 or more.&#13;

236              2011    The Little Data Book on Climate Change&#13;
&amp;#12;Renewable energy in 2010&#13;
2010 saw a new record for global investment in renewable power and fuels1&#13;
of $211 billion. This reflects a 32 percent increase in investments compared&#13;
to 2009 and nearly seven-fold increase compared to 2004. Investment levels&#13;
were boosted particularly by wind farm development in China and small-scale&#13;
solar photovoltaic installations on rooftops in Europe.&#13;
&#13;
Asset finance for utility-scale generation and biofuel projects reached $128&#13;
billion in 2010 rising from 19 percent in 2009. Over the same period, invest-&#13;
ment in small distributed capacity soared 91 percent to $60 billion. Though&#13;
renewable power capacity remains a small fraction of total world power&#13;
capacity at around 8 percent (excluding large hydropower), its share in overall&#13;
new power capacity additions is gradually increasing and has risen from&#13;
about 10 percent to 34 percent between 2004 and 2010. Investment in&#13;
renewable energy (excluding large hydropower) is also progressively catching&#13;
up with investment in fossil fuelâ&#128;&#147;based generation capacity. Investment in&#13;
small-scale renewable heat (e.g., biomass heating, ground- and air- source&#13;
heating, and solar water heating) is also gaining traction. In 2010, invest-&#13;
ment in solar water heating alone was estimated at $10 billion.2&#13;
&#13;
Other segments of the value chain also grew over the period 2009â&#128;&#147;10:&#13;
venture capital for young firms rose 59 percent to $2.4 billion; equity-raising&#13;
on the public markets by quoted renewable energy companies grew 23Â per-&#13;
cent to $15.4 billion; and government-funded research and development&#13;
increased by 121 percent to $5.3 billion as more â&#128;&#156;green stimulusâ&#128;? funds&#13;
arrived in the sector. Only two areas of investment declined over this period.&#13;
Corporate research, development, and deployment dropped 12 percent to&#13;
$3.3 billion as companies retrenched in the face of economic difficulties.&#13;
Expansion capital provided by private equity funds for renewable energy&#13;
companies also decreased by 1 percent to $3.1 billion.&#13;
&#13;
For the first time, developing countries overtook industrialized countries in&#13;
financial new investment (i.e., total investment minus small-scale projects&#13;
and government and corporate research and development [R&amp;D]). Financial&#13;
new investment exceeded $72 billion in developing countries and just over&#13;
$70 billion in developed countries. This compares to a ratio of nearly four-&#13;
to-one for equivalent investment in favor of developed countries in 2004.&#13;
Importantly, developing countries are starting to host the development of&#13;
a range of new renewable energy technologies for specific, local applica-&#13;
tions from rice-husk power generation to solar telecommunications towers.&#13;
&#13;
China attracted the most investment in renewable energy for the second&#13;
year in a row. In 2010, financial new investment rose 28 percent to almost&#13;
$49 billion, representing more than a third of global financial new invest-&#13;
ment. Expenditure in the United States, ranked second, jumped 58 percent&#13;
in 2010 to just over $25 billion. Developed economies remain well ahead in&#13;
&#13;
1   This includes all biomass, geothermal, and wind generation project of more than&#13;
    1Â  megawatt (MW), all hydro projects of 0.5 to 50.0 MW, all solar projects of more&#13;
    than 0.3 MW, all marine energy projects, and all biofuel projects with a capacity of&#13;
    1Â million liters or more per year.&#13;
2   Small-scale renewable heat is not included in the overall renewable energy because&#13;
    it delivers energy services but does not generate power.&#13;

investment for small-scale projects and R&amp;D, which are not included in the&#13;
financial new investment measure. Germany had the highest investment in&#13;
small-scale projects in 2010 at $34.3 billion (60 percent of the world total).&#13;
&#13;
Wind remains the leading technology, with solar now a close second. Finan-&#13;
cial new investment in wind energy and investment in small distributed wind&#13;
capacity reached $95 billion in 2010 (up 30 percent from 2009). The majority&#13;
of this investment was asset finance ($90 billion). Financial new invest-&#13;
ment in solar energy and small distributed solar capacity rose 52Â percent&#13;
in 2010 compared to 2009 to reach $86 billion. Small distributed capacity&#13;
represented 70 percent of this investment.&#13;

Renewable energy targets&#13;
&#13;
This table summarizes various renewable energy targets announced by coun-&#13;
tries. Targets vary significantly with respect to sector coverage, baseline&#13;
year, methodology, and form, and thus are generally not comparable.&#13;
&#13;
Renewable targets include both voluntary and mandatory targets. Renewable&#13;
energy targets in italics are expressed as percentages of primary energy;&#13;
other targets are expressed in terms of final energy. Primary energy typically&#13;
covers direct use at the supply level before transformation or distribution,&#13;
while final energy covers energy supplied to consumers.&#13;

Annex-I emissions reduction target is the Annex-I (A1) countryâ&#128;&#153;s target for&#13;
reducing economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 to the UNFCCC&#13;
under the Copenhagen Accord. Targets are relative to 1990 emissions unless&#13;
otherwise specified. Multiple targets indicate that countries have signaled a&#13;
willingness to accept deeper targets, contingent on commitments by other&#13;
parties or other conditions. (EU) indicates that the target submitted by&#13;
the European Union and its member States applies to this country. â&#128;&#156;n/aâ&#128;?&#13;
indicates that the country is not an Annex-1 party to the UNFCCC. (UNFCCC&#13;

&#13;
Access to electricity is the percentage of population with access to electric-&#13;
ity. Electrification data are collected from industry, national surveys, and&#13;
international sources. (International Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook&#13;
2010; data are for 2008/2009)&#13;
&#13;
Access to improved sanitation is the percentage of population with ade-&#13;
quate access to excreta disposal facilities (private or shared, but not pub-&#13;
lic) that can effectively prevent human, animal, and insect contact with&#13;
excreta. Improved facilities range from simple but protected pit latrines to&#13;
flush toilets with a sewerage connection. To be effective, facilities must be&#13;
correctly constructed and properly maintained. (World Health Organization;&#13;
data are for 2008)&#13;
&#13;
Access to improved water source is the percentage of the population&#13;
with reasonable access to an adequate amount of water from an improved&#13;
source, such as piped water into a dwelling, plot, or yard; public tap or&#13;
standpipe; tube-well or borehole; protected dug well or spring; or rainwater&#13;
collection. Unimproved sources include an unprotected dug well or spring,&#13;
cart with small tank or drum, bottled water, and tanker trucks. Reasonable&#13;
access to an adequate amount means the availability of at least 20 liters a&#13;
person a day from a source within 1 kilometer of the dwelling. (World Health&#13;
Organization; data are for 2008)&#13;
&#13;
Agricultural land is arable land, land under permanent crops, and permanent&#13;
pastures. Arable land includes land defined by the Food and Agriculture&#13;
Organization of the United Nations as land under temporary crops (double-&#13;
cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for&#13;
pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow.&#13;
Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded. Land under&#13;
permanent crops is land cultivated with crops that occupy the land for long&#13;
periods and need not be replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa, cof-&#13;
fee, and rubber. This category includes land under flowering shrubs, fruit&#13;
trees, nut trees, and vines but excludes land under trees grown for wood&#13;
or timber. Permanent pasture is land used for five or more years for forage,&#13;
including natural and cultivated crops. (Food and Agriculture Organization)&#13;
&#13;
Agricultural land under irrigation is the area purposely provided with water,&#13;
including land irrigated by controlled flooding. (Food and Agriculture Organiza-&#13;
tion; data are for 2009)&#13;

Annual freshwater withdrawals are total water withdrawals, excluding evapo-&#13;
ration losses from storage basins and including water from desalination&#13;
plants in countries where they are a significant source. Withdrawals can&#13;
exceed 100 percent of internal renewable resources because river flows&#13;
from other countries are not included, because extraction from nonrenewable&#13;
aquifers or desalination plants is considerable, or because there is signifi-&#13;
cant water reuse. (Food and Agriculture Organization and World Resources&#13;
Institute; data are for various years; for details, see World Development&#13;
Indicators 2011, Primary data documentation)&#13;

Average annual precipitation is the sum of the rainfall and the assumed&#13;
water equivalent of the snowfall for the year in the country, averaged over&#13;
the years 1961â&#128;&#147;1990. Values are based on gridded climatologies from the&#13;
Climatic Research Unit (Mitchell et al., 2003).&#13;
&#13;
Average daily min/max temperature are the minimum and maximum daily&#13;
temperatures in the country, averaged for the years 1961â&#128;&#147;90, based on&#13;

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are emissions from the burning of fossil&#13;
fuels and the manufacture of cement and include carbon dioxide produced&#13;
during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels and gas flaring. (Carbon&#13;
Dioxide Information Analysis Center; latest data are for 2008)&#13;
&#13;
Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per capita are carbon dioxide emissions&#13;
divided by midyear population. (Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center,&#13;
World Bank, and United Nations; data are for 2008)&#13;
&#13;
Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per units of GDP are carbon dioxide emis-&#13;
sions in kilograms per $1,000 of GDP in 2005 purchasing power parity (PPP)&#13;
terms. PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars&#13;
using PPP rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over&#13;

Cereal yield is measured in kilograms per hectare of harvested land and&#13;
includes wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum, buckwheat,&#13;
and mixed grains. Production data on cereals refer to crops harvested for&#13;
dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food,&#13;
feed, or silage, and those used for grazing, are excluded. The FAO allocates&#13;
production data to the calendar year in which the bulk of the harvest took&#13;
place. But most of a crop harvested near the end of a year will be used in&#13;
the following year. (Food and Agriculture Organization; data are for 2009)&#13;

Disaster risk reduction progress score is an average of self-assessment&#13;
scores, ranging from 1 to 5, submitted by countries under Priority 1 of the&#13;
Hyogo Framework National Progress Reports. The Hyogo Framework is a&#13;
global blueprint for disaster risk reduction efforts that was adopted by 168&#13;
countries in 2005. Assessments of â&#128;&#156;Priority 1â&#128;? include four indicators that&#13;
reflect the degree to which countries have prioritized disaster risk reduction&#13;
and the strengthening of relevant institutions (UNISDR, 2009â&#128;&#147;11 Progress&#13;

&#13;
Droughts, floods, and extreme temperatures is the annual average per-&#13;
centage of the population that is affected by natural disasters classified&#13;
as either droughts, floods, or extreme temperature events. A drought is an&#13;
extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a regionâ&#128;&#153;s water&#13;
supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought&#13;
can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower&#13;
plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant&#13;
rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir, or coastal region. Extreme&#13;
temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be&#13;
both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion&#13;
of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost, it can cause damage to&#13;
agriculture, infrastructure, and property. A heat wave is a prolonged period&#13;
of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal&#13;
climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of&#13;
people injured, left homeless, or requiring immediate assistance during a&#13;
period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include&#13;
displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected&#13;
is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by&#13;
the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated. (EM-DAT:&#13;

&#13;
GHG net emissions/removals by LUCF refers to changes in atmospheric&#13;
levels of all greenhouse gases attributable to forest and land-use change&#13;
activities, including but not limited to (1) emissions and removals of CO2&#13;
from decreases or increases in biomass stocks due to forest management,&#13;
logging, fuelwood collection, and so forth; (2) conversion of existing forests&#13;
and natural grasslands to other land uses; (3) removal of CO2 from the&#13;
abandonment of formerly managed lands (e.g. croplands and pastures); and&#13;
(4) emissions and removals of CO2 in soil associated with land-use change&#13;
and management. For Annex-I countries under the UNFCCC, these data are&#13;
drawn from the annual GHG inventories submitted to the UNFCCC by each&#13;
country; for non-Annex-I countries, data are drawn from the most recently&#13;

GNI per capita is the gross national income, converted to U.S. dollars using&#13;
the World Bank Atlas method, divided by the midyear population. GNI is the&#13;
sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less&#13;
subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary&#13;
income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad.&#13;
GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars&#13;
at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an&#13;
alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge&#13;
by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in interna-&#13;
tional transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a&#13;
special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies&#13;
a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the&#13;
two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between&#13;
the country and the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The little data book on climate change
            includes a diverse set of indicators selected from the
            global economic and scientific communities. These indicators
            recognize the intrinsic relationship between climate change
            and development and attempt to synthesize important aspects
            of current and projected climate conditions, exposure to
            climate impacts, resilience, greenhouse gas emissions, and
            the current state of efforts to take action. The little data
            book on climate change draws upon several online resources,
            including the open data website, the climate change
            knowledge portal, and the open data for resilience
            initiative. These resources from the World Bank and the
            Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)
            provide free and open access to data and information
            relevant to climate risk, climate change, and development at
            the international, national and subnational levels. These
            resources contain many more indicators than are available in
            the limited space of this book and include interactive
            tools, visualizations on the use and interpretation of the
            data. In addition, there are other tools that will help
            users and programmers access World Bank data and develop applications.
