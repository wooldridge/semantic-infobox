The Little Data Book on External Debt was prepared by the Financial Data&#13;
Team of the Development Data Group of the Development Economics&#13;
Vice Presidency, led by Ibrahim Levent. The team consisted of Laila Adair,&#13;
Tayani Vincent Banda, Nanasamudd Chhim, Nevin Fahmy, Shelley Fu, Nino&#13;
Kostava, Gloria Moreno, Yasue Sakuramoto, and Alagiri Venkatesan. The&#13;
team was assisted by Awatif H. Abuzeid and Rosario Alipio. Many others&#13;
inside the World Bank provided helpful input, and the country economists&#13;
reviewed the data. The work was carried out under the management of&#13;
Shaida Badiee.&#13;
&#13;
Production of the volume was managed by Richard Fix, with assistance&#13;
from Azita Amjadi, Buyant Erdene Khaltarkhuu, Beatriz Prieto-Oramas, and&#13;
William Prince of the Development Data Group. Meta de Coquereaumount,&#13;
Christopher Trott, and Elaine Wilson of Communications Development&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                    Foreword&#13;
The Little Data Book on External Debt, a pocket edition of Global Development&#13;
Finance 2008, Volume II, Summary and Country Tables, contains statistical&#13;
tables on the external debt of the 134 countries that report public and&#13;
publicly guaranteed debt under the Debtor Reporting System. It also&#13;
includes tables of selected debt and resource flow statistics for individual&#13;
reporting countries as well as summary tables for regional and income&#13;
groups. It is the culmination of a year-long process that requires extensive&#13;
cooperation from people and organizations around the globe--national&#13;
central banks, ministries of finance, major multilateral organizations, and&#13;
many departments of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The Little Data Book on External Debt provides a quick reference for users&#13;
of the Global Development Finance 2008 book, CD-ROM, GDF Online, and&#13;
the electronic subscription database. The general cutoff date for data is&#13;
December 2007.&#13;
&#13;
The Little Data Book on External Debt covers external debt stocks and flows,&#13;
major economic aggregates, key debt ratios, and the currency composition&#13;
of long-term debt for all countries reporting through the Debtor Reporting&#13;
System. Terms used in tables are defined in the Glossary.&#13;
&#13;
The economic aggregates presented in the tables are prepared for the&#13;
convenience of users. Although debt ratios can provide useful information&#13;
about developments in debt-servicing capacity, drawing valid conclusions&#13;
from them requires careful economic evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
The macroeconomic information is from standard sources, but much of it is&#13;
subject to considerable margins of error, and the usual care must be taken&#13;
in interpreting the indicators. This is particularly the case for the most&#13;
recent year, for which figures are preliminary and subject to revision.&#13;

Unless otherwise indicated, all data are in millions of U.S. dollars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The following symbols are used throughout the tables:&#13;
&#13;
 0.0      indicates that data exist, but are negligible or a true zero&#13;
&#13;
     ..   indicates that data are not available&#13;
&#13;
     --   indicates that data have not been calculated&#13;
&#13;
     $    indicates current U.S. dollars&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Converting to a common currency&#13;
&#13;
 Debt data are normally reported to the World Bank in the currency&#13;
 of repayment. To produce summary tables, these data have to be&#13;
 converted to a common currency (usually U.S. dollars). Because flow&#13;
 data are converted at average annual exchange rates and stock data&#13;
 at year-end exchange rates, year to year changes in debt outstanding&#13;
 and disbursed are sometimes not equal to net flows (disbursements&#13;
 less principal repayments). Similarly, changes in debt outstanding,&#13;
 including undisbursed debt, differ from commitments less repayments.&#13;
 Discrepancies are particularly large when exchange rates have moved&#13;
 sharply during the year; cancellations and reschedulings of other&#13;
 liabilities into long-term public debt also contribute to the differences.&#13;

indicates that the country was fully current in its reporting under the&#13;
Debtor Reporting System and that World Bank staff are satisfied that the&#13;
reported data give an adequate and fair representation of the country's&#13;
total external debt. Preliminary data are based on reported or collected&#13;
information but, because of incompleteness or other reasons, include an&#13;
element of staff estimation. Estimated data indicate that countries are not&#13;
current in their reporting and that a significant element of staff estimation&#13;
has been necessary in producing the data tables.&#13;

&amp;#12;                  Income group tables&#13;
For operational and analytical purposes the World Bank's main criterion&#13;
for classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Every&#13;
economy in The Little Book on External Debt is classified as low income&#13;
or middle income. Low- and middle-income economies are sometimes&#13;
referred to as developing economies. The use of the term is convenient; it&#13;
is not intended to imply that all economies in the group are experiencing&#13;
similar development or that other economies have reached a preferred or&#13;
final stage of development. Classification by income does not necessarily&#13;
reflect development status.&#13;
&#13;
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $905 or less&#13;
in 2006.&#13;
&#13;
Middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than&#13;
$905 but less than $11,116. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-&#13;
income countries are separated at a GNI per capita of $3,595.&#13;

Bonds include publicly issued or privately placed bonds with an original&#13;
maturity of more than one year.&#13;
&#13;
Currency composition of public and publicly guaranteed debt provides infor-&#13;
mation on the currency composition of loans outstanding and disbursed&#13;
based on the repayment currency of individual loans. For major multilateral&#13;
creditors currency composition is based on the reporting currency, which&#13;
is mostly U.S. dollars and unit of account. The major currencies in which&#13;
the external debt of low- and middle-income countries is contracted are&#13;
separately identified, as is debt denominated in special drawing rights and&#13;
debt repayable in multiple currencies.&#13;
&#13;
Debt forgiveness grants are both debts cancelled by agreement between&#13;
debtor and creditor and reductions in the net present value of non­official&#13;
development assistance debt from concessional rescheduling or refinanc-&#13;
ing. Data are on a disbursement basis and cover flows from all bilateral&#13;
and multilateral donors.&#13;
&#13;
Debt per capita is total external debt divided by midyear population.&#13;
&#13;
Debt ratios are ratios of debt and debt service to some selected economic&#13;
aggregates.&#13;
&#13;
Debt service to exports, also called the debt service ratio, is the ratio of&#13;
total debt service paid to exports of goods and services (including workers'&#13;
remittances).&#13;
&#13;
Debt to exports is the ratio of total external debt to exports of goods and&#13;
services (including workers' remittances).&#13;
&#13;
Debt to GNI is the ratio of total external debt to gross national income.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements are drawings on loan commitments by the borrower during&#13;
the year specified.&#13;
&#13;
Exports of goods, services, and income are the total value of goods and&#13;
services exported and receipts of compensation of employees and invest-&#13;
ment income. Workers' remittances, a transfer and not an income entry&#13;
in the balance of payments, are treated as compensation of employees in&#13;
Global Development Finance because they are often difficult to distinguish&#13;
from compensation of nonresident workers and migrants.&#13;
&#13;
Foreign direct investment (FDI, net) is an investment made to acquire&#13;
a lasting management interest (usually 10 percent of voting stock) in an&#13;
enterprise operating in a country other than that of the investor (defined by&#13;
residency), with the investor's purpose being an effective voice in manag-&#13;
ing the enterprise. It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings,&#13;
other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of&#13;

&amp;#12;Glossary&#13;
Grants (excluding technical cooperation) are legally binding commitments&#13;
that obligate a specific value of funds available for disbursement without a&#13;
repayment requirement. See technical cooperation grants.&#13;
&#13;
Gross national income (GNI) is the sum of value added by all resident pro-&#13;
ducers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation&#13;
of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees&#13;
and property income) from abroad. Yearly average exchange rates are used&#13;
to convert GNI from local currency to U.S. dollars.&#13;
&#13;
International Development Association (IDA) grants are net disburse-&#13;
ments of grants from IDA.&#13;
&#13;
IMF charges are the amount of interest paid under all International&#13;
Monetary Fund (IMF) facilities except the poverty reduction and growth&#13;
facility and the enhanced structural adjustment facility. Charges are paid&#13;
at the IMF's market-related interest rate, which is based on the special&#13;
drawing rights (of the IMF) interest rate.&#13;
&#13;
IMF purchases are total drawings on the general resources account of the&#13;
International Monetary Fund during the year specified, excluding drawings&#13;
in the reserve tranche.&#13;
&#13;
IMF repurchases are total repayments of outstanding drawings from the&#13;
general resources account of the International Monetary Fund during the&#13;
year specified, excluding repayments due in the reserve tranche.&#13;
&#13;
Interest arrears on long-term debt are interest payments due but not paid,&#13;
shown on a cumulative basis.&#13;
&#13;
Interest payments are the amount of interest paid in foreign currency,&#13;
goods, or services in the year specified.&#13;
&#13;
Long-term external debt is debt with an original or extended maturity&#13;
of more than one year, owed to nonresidents, and repayable in foreign&#13;
currency, goods, or services. Long-term debt has three components: pub-&#13;
lic debt, publicly guaranteed debt, and private nonguaranteed external&#13;
debt.&#13;
&#13;
Net flows of long-term debt (excluding IMF) received by the borrower dur-&#13;
ing the year are disbursements minus principal repayments.&#13;
&#13;
Net flows on debt are disbursements on long-term debt and International&#13;
Monetary Fund (IMF) purchases minus principal repayments on long-term&#13;
debt and IMF repurchases. Net flows also include the change in stock of&#13;
short-term debt (excluding interest arrears for long-term debt). Thus if the&#13;
change in stock is positive, a disbursement is assumed to have taken&#13;
place; if negative, a repayment is assumed to have taken place.&#13;

&amp;#12;Net transfers are net long-term resource flows minus interest payments on&#13;
long-term loans and foreign direct investment profits.&#13;
&#13;
Official creditors include multilateral and bilateral debt.&#13;
&#13;
Other net resource flows include net flows as well as nondebt flows from&#13;
various international organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Population is the midyear estimate of all residents regardless of legal&#13;
status or citizenship, except for refugees not permanently settled in the&#13;
country of asylum, who are generally considered part of the population of&#13;
their country of origin.&#13;
&#13;
Portfolio equity flows are the sum of country funds, depository receipts&#13;
(U.S. or global), and direct purchases of shares by foreign investors.&#13;
&#13;
Present value of debt outstanding is the discounted value of scheduled&#13;
debt service payments on debt. It is based on the annual debt service&#13;
(principal plus interest) discounted by the Commercial Interest Reference&#13;
Rates of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,&#13;
according to the currency of payment of the loan. If the interest rate on&#13;
debt is above the discount rate, the present value of debt will be greater&#13;
than the nominal value. For the 42 countries in the Heavily Indebted Poor&#13;
Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative present value comes from HIPC documents&#13;
and is based on public and publicly guaranteed debt, including International&#13;
Monetary Fund credit.&#13;
&#13;
Present value of debt to exports is the ratio of the present value of total&#13;
external debt to exports of goods and services. It is calculated as the ratio&#13;
of the present value of debt for 2006 to the three-year (2004­06) average&#13;
of exports and might include World Bank staff estimates.&#13;
&#13;
Present value of debt to GNI is the ratio of the present value of total exter-&#13;
nal debt to gross national income (GNI). It is calculated as the ratio of the&#13;
present value of debt for 2006 to the three-year (2004­06) average of GNI&#13;
and might include World Bank staff estimates.&#13;
&#13;
Principal repayments are the amounts of principal (amortization) paid in&#13;
foreign currency, goods, or services.&#13;
&#13;
Private creditors include bondholders, commercial banks, and other trade-&#13;
related lenders.&#13;
&#13;
Private nonguaranteed external debt is an external obligation of a private&#13;
debtor that is not guaranteed for repayment by a public entity.&#13;
&#13;
Profit remittances on FDI are payments of foreign direct investment&#13;
income (debit side), which consist of income on equity (dividends, branch&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Public and publicly guaranteed debt is an external obligation of a public&#13;
debtor, including the national government, a political subdivision (or an&#13;
agency of either), and autonomous public bodies or an external obligation&#13;
of a private debtor that is guaranteed for repayment by a public entity.&#13;
&#13;
Reserves to total external debt is the ratio of international reserves to&#13;
total external debt.&#13;
&#13;
Share of public sector debt in total is public sector debt as a percentage&#13;
of total external debt.&#13;
&#13;
Short-term external debt has an original maturity of one year or less.&#13;
Available data permit no distinction between public and private nonguar-&#13;
anteed short-term debt.&#13;
&#13;
Technical cooperation grants are free-standing technical cooperation&#13;
grants for financing the transfer of technical and managerial skills or&#13;
technology for building general national capacity without reference to any&#13;
specific investment projects, and investment-related technical coopera-&#13;
tion grants for strengthening the capacity to execute specific investment&#13;
projects.&#13;
&#13;
Total debt service paid is debt service payments on total long-term&#13;
debt (public and publicly guaranteed and private nonguaranteed), use of&#13;
International Monetary Fund credit, and interest on short-term debt.&#13;
&#13;
Total external debt consists of public and publicly guaranteed long-term&#13;
debt, private nonguaranteed long-term debt, the use of International&#13;
Monetary Fund (IMF) credit, and short-term debt. Interest in arrears on&#13;
long-term debt and the use of IMF credit are added to short-term debt and&#13;
are shown as separate lines.&#13;
&#13;
Use of International Monetary Fund (IMF) credit covers repurchase obli-&#13;
gations to the IMF for all uses of IMF resources (excluding those resulting&#13;
from drawings in the reserve tranche) shown for the end of the year and&#13;
purchases outstanding under credit tranches, including enlarged access&#13;
resources and all special facilities, trust fund loans, the poverty reduction&#13;
and growth facility, and the structural adjustment facility.&#13;
&#13;
Workers' remittances and compensation of employees include current&#13;
transfers by migrant workers and wages and salaries earned by nonresi-&#13;
dent workers. In addition, migrants' transfers, a part of capital transfers,&#13;
are treated as worker remittances in Global Development Finance.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The little data book on external debt, a
            pocket edition of Global Development Finance (GDF) 2008,
            volume two, summary and country tables, contains statistical
            tables on the external debt of the 134 countries that report
            public and publicly guaranteed debt under the debtor
            reporting system. It also includes tables of selected debt
            and resource flow statistics for individual reporting
            countries as well as summary tables for regional and income
            groups. It is the culmination of a year-long process that
            requires extensive cooperation from people and organizations
            around the globe national central banks, ministries of
            finance, major multilateral organizations, and many
            departments of the World Bank. The little data book on
            external debt provides a quick reference for users of the
            GDF 2008 book, CD-ROM, GDF Online, and the electronic
            subscription database. The general cutoff date for data is
            December 2007. The economic aggregates presented in the
            tables are prepared for the convenience of users. Although
            debt ratios can provide useful information about
            developments in debt-servicing capacity, drawing valid
            conclusions from them requires careful economic evaluation.
