Trust Fund Description for the Global Food Safety Partnership Multi-Donor Trust Fund (TF071937)&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all administration agreements for the Trust&#13;

1. Objectives&#13;
The objective of the Trust Fund is to support the Global Food Safety Partnership (GFSP), which aims to&#13;
bring together concerned global stakeholders to collaborate on capacity building activities for improved food&#13;
safety systems, with the goal of enhancing agri-food value chains and improving public health outcomes.&#13;
The GFSP intends to support the Bank's and stakeholders' vision for improved food safety as a global public&#13;
good, and to contribute to food security, accelerated economic growth, facilitated trade and reduced rural&#13;
poverty. The outcomes of the GFSP are envisaged to be achieved through the delivery of a five-year work&#13;
plan of demand-driven food safety capacity building and advisory services for countries, supported by&#13;
stakeholders, and funded mainly by contributions to the Trust Fund. This five-year work plan is developed&#13;
by the Bank in consultation with stakeholders and may be amended from time to time by the Bank (the&#13;
"Five-Year Work Plan"). The Five-Year Work Plan will serve as the main operational document of the&#13;

ï»¿ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions for the Global Food Safety Partnership Multi-Donor Trust Fund (TF071937)&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements between the&#13;
Bank and the respective Donors for their respective Contributions (collectively, "Contributions") to the Trust&#13;
Fund.&#13;
1.    Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1   The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   The Contributions shall be administered in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and&#13;
procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time, including its procurement, financial&#13;
management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption&#13;
and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the&#13;
Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of&#13;
the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any&#13;
obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and&#13;
executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be kept&#13;
separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be commingled&#13;
with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the&#13;
funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the&#13;
Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions,&#13;
the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on&#13;
the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of&#13;
exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any&#13;
additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as&#13;

&#13;
ï»¿2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their disbursement&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust funds&#13;
administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to the Trust Fund to be&#13;
used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank may deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment, an&#13;
amount equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2   In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program management and&#13;
Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an&#13;
administrative fee and (ii) included under the activities described in Component 4 (Program Management&#13;
and Administration) of Paragraph 2 of Annex 1 to the Administration Agreements and in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis up to a&#13;
maximum of twelve percent (12%) of the total Contributions under all Administration Agreements.&#13;

and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration&#13;
Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to&#13;
request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by&#13;
amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable&#13;
to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration&#13;
Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;

such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange for such&#13;
8&#13;

months following the End Disbursement Date. The Donor and the Bank shall agree on the scope and&#13;
conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant information within the limits of&#13;
the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the&#13;
Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a&#13;
financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.     Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by June&#13;
30, 2018 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank shall only disburse funds deposited in the Trust Fund&#13;
for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donors) after such date to the extent&#13;

and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration Agreement, including any Grant&#13;
Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank shall return to the&#13;
relevant Donor or Donors in the Holding Currency in the manner specified by each such Donor in its&#13;
respective Administration Agreement the pro rata share(s) of any such uncommitted balance of the Trust&#13;
Fund, in accordance with any additional terms that may be agreed between the Bank and each such Donor.&#13;
7.     Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;
7.1    The Bank shall disclose the Administration Agreements and related information on this Trust Fund&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering into Administration&#13;
Agreements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective Administration Agreements and such&#13;
related information.&#13;
7.2    The Donors and the Bank shall use their best efforts to amicably settle any dispute, controversy, or&#13;
