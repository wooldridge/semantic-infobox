INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In fiscal year 2006, the number of ICSID pending cases reached an all-time high of 118.&#13;
The total number of conciliation and arbitration proceedings registered with the Centre&#13;
since its inception rose to 210 with the addition of 26 new arbitration cases instituted in&#13;
the course of the fiscal year.The Secretariat continued its efforts to mitigate the impact of&#13;
the significant caseload involving large and complex disputes by promoting more efficient&#13;
ways of case management.During the year,ICSID's membership grew to 143 Contracting&#13;
States following the ratification of the ICSID Convention by Syria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A process of extensive consultations with ICSID Member States on further improvements&#13;
of the procedural framework for ICSID arbitration was concluded in the fiscal year with&#13;
the adoption of new amendments to the ICSID regulations and rules. During these&#13;
consultations ICSID Member States confirmed their support for the ICSID dispute&#13;
settlement mechanisms and made a number of recommendations for improvements&#13;
which were reflected in the amended rules. Designed to allow for a more efficient and&#13;
transparent process, the amended rules provide for preliminary procedures concerning&#13;
provisional measures, expedited procedures for dismissal of unmeritorious claims, access&#13;
of non-disputing parties to proceedings, publication of awards, and additional disclosure&#13;
requirements for arbitrators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Secretariat continued to promote greater awareness of the ICSID dispute settlement&#13;
process during the year.An important component of the ICSID knowledge dissemination&#13;
efforts is the ICSID Review--Foreign Investment Law Journal, which was launched in 1986.&#13;
For 20 years ICSID has been working with authors making the journal a reputable&#13;
source of knowledge on international investment arbitration. Two issues of the journal&#13;
were published in the fiscal year in addition to the regular updates of the Centre's&#13;
collections of Investment Laws of the World and Investment Treaties and the two issues of&#13;
ICSID's newsletter, News from ICSID.The Centre's website continued to be an important&#13;
source of current information on ICSID and its activities.The Secretariat also organized&#13;
and co-sponsored conferences on international arbitration. Staff of the Centre participated&#13;
as speakers and panelists in some 34 conferences around the world.The Deputy Secretary-&#13;
General delivered a course on current issues in international arbitration under the ICSID&#13;
Convention at the Hague Academy of International Law.&#13;

                                                                                         38040&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Co-operation with other arbitration institutions and international organizations remains&#13;
an important part of ICSID's institutional activities. In the past fiscal year, ICSID signed a&#13;
co-operation agreement with the German Institution of Arbitration (DIS).The agreement&#13;
calls for the holding of ICSID proceedings, if so requested by the parties concerned,&#13;
at the Frankfurt International Arbitration Center of DIS and the Frankfurt Chamber&#13;
of Commerce and Industry. Moreover, in December 2005, ICSID co-hosted with the&#13;
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United&#13;
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) a high level symposium on&#13;
investor-State dispute settlement. Further, the Acting Lead Counsel co-chaired the 2006&#13;
Annual Workshop of the Institute for Transnational Arbitration. ICSID also continued&#13;
during the year its collaboration with the International Council for CommercialArbitration&#13;
and the International Federation of Commercial Arbitration Institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Significant changes in the leadership of the Centre took place in the course of the fiscal&#13;
year. In September 2005, Antonio R. Parra retired from the post of Deputy Secretary-&#13;
General of the Centre. In January 2006, Roberto Dañino resigned as ICSID's Secretary-&#13;
General. Since then, Scott B.White has served as Acting Secretary-General and Margrete&#13;
Stevens has served as Acting Lead Counsel.At the closure of the fiscal year PaulWolfowitz,&#13;
Chairman of ICSID'sAdministrative Council,indicated his intent to nominate for election&#13;
as new Secretary-General Ana Palacio, the incoming Senior Vice President and General&#13;
Counsel of theWorld Bank Group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Details on the developments in the Centre's activities in fiscal year 2006 are set forth below.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
DISPUTES BEFORE THE CENTRE&#13;
The number of ICSID proceedings continued to rise during the year, resulting in a new&#13;
record of 118 cases administered by the Centre in the course of a single fiscal year. By the&#13;
end of FY 2006, the total number of cases registered with the Centre since its inception&#13;
reached 210.These include 26 new arbitration proceedings registered during the fiscal year.&#13;
Three of the new cases are conducted under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, and&#13;
the remaining 23 are ICSID Convention arbitration proceedings.Twenty-one of the new&#13;
proceedings were based on bilateral and/or multilateral investment treaties. Of these, the&#13;
jurisdiction of ICSID is being asserted under the North American Free Trade Agreement&#13;
(NAFTA) in two cases and under the Energy CharterTreaty in three cases.The remaining&#13;
five new proceedings were based on ICSID arbitration provisions contained in investment&#13;
contracts. The Centre also registered two applications for the institution of annulment&#13;
proceedings and an application for the rectification of an award.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Fifteen ICSID cases were concluded in the course of FY 2006, of which 10 were original&#13;
arbitration proceedings.The majority of these proceedings were discontinued following&#13;
settlement at the request of one or both of the parties involved. Seven orders taking note&#13;
of the discontinuance of ICSID arbitration proceedings were issued, three of which were&#13;
based on the request of both parties and four on the request of one party.Three original&#13;
arbitration proceedings were concluded with awards, all of which rejected the respective&#13;
claims on the merits. In addition, an ICSID conciliation proceeding was concluded and a&#13;
report of the conciliation commission was issued.Following the parties'failure to reach an&#13;
agreement in the conciliation proceeding,a request for institution of an ICSID arbitration&#13;
proceeding was filed. Four proceedings in which parties sought post-award remedies were&#13;
also concluded in the fiscal year.These included an ad hoc committee decision concerning&#13;
an application for the annulment of an award,a decision of an arbitral tribunal on a request&#13;
for interpretation of an award,and a decision of another arbitral tribunal on an application&#13;
for rectification of an award.A further annulment proceeding was discontinued by an order&#13;
of an ICSID ad hoc committee following settlement by the parties concerned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 0 6                                                            5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                        38040&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ICSID tribunals issued a number of decisions with procedural ramifications other than&#13;
the conclusion of proceedings.These included ten decisions upholding jurisdiction; eight&#13;
orders granting requests for a temporary suspension of proceedings; two decisions for the&#13;
discontinuance of proceedings with regard to one of multiple claimants; a decision for the&#13;
discontinuance of a proceeding in respect to a particular claim; a decision on stay of the&#13;
proceeding for lack of payment of requested advances; and a large number of procedural&#13;
orders for the conduct of the proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A particular development in the caseload of the Centre during the fiscal year was the rising&#13;
number of cases brought against States in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Such cases&#13;
represented 52 percent of all arbitration proceedings registered in FY 2006. According&#13;
to the geographical location of respondent States, the largest number of pending cases&#13;
during the year involved countries in the LatinAmerica and Caribbean region and Eastern&#13;
Europe and Central Asia. Such cases represented 74 percent of the total 118 ICSID cases&#13;
administered in the fiscal year.A small portion of the pending caseload involved countries&#13;
in South and East Asia.The remaining cases were almost evenly divided among countries&#13;
in the Middle East and North Africa region and in Sub-Saharan Africa. Almost half of&#13;
the current cases relate to projects in the energy and in the public utilities sectors and the&#13;
remainder involves investments in a variety of other economic sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Altogether, 60 different sessions and hearings were held in the cases pending before the&#13;
Centre during the fiscal year.The majority of these were held at the seat of the Centre&#13;
in Washington, D.C., but a number of sessions and hearings took place at other venues in&#13;
Europe,the Middle East and LatinAmerica.Several organizational meetings and first sessions&#13;
were held via video or telephone conferencing.Twenty-five ICSID arbitral tribunals, two&#13;
ad hoc committees and one conciliation commission were constituted or reconstituted in&#13;
the pending cases. Sixty-one individuals from 21 countries were appointed to serve as&#13;
ICSID arbitrators,conciliators or ad hoc committee members.The parties or party-selected&#13;
arbitrators nominated 85 percent of the total 82 appointments made in the cases pending&#13;
during the year.The remaining 15 percent of the appointments were made by ICSID.One&#13;
third of the appointees were nationals of developing countries.Women were appointed in&#13;
three of the cases.The proceedings before the ICSID commissions, tribunals and ad hoc&#13;
committees during the year were conducted in one of the three official languages of ICSID&#13;
(English, French and Spanish) in half, or 59, of the cases. In the other half, two of these&#13;
languages were used in different combinations as procedural languages of the proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

6                                                                                      I C S I D&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                         38040&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During the fiscal year,ICSID continued to provide administrative support for 10 arbitration&#13;
proceedings conducted under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on&#13;
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).Two of these proceedings were concluded with&#13;
awards in the course of the fiscal year. One of the pending proceedings encompasses three&#13;
separate disputes,instituted against the same State,being heard by the same tribunal following&#13;
the first consolidation order ever issued under the consolidation provisions of the Investment&#13;
Chapter of the NAFTA.The services provided by the Centre in the pending UNCITRAL&#13;
proceedings range from limited assistance with the organization of hearings and holding of&#13;
the account established in the case to full Secretariat services in the administration of the&#13;
cases concerned.Also during the fiscal year,the Secretary-General of ICSID,in his capacity&#13;
as appointing authority of arbitrators in UNCITRAL proceedings, decided on a challenge&#13;
of an arbitrator in an UNCITRAL case.ICSID also handled the administration of an expert&#13;
determination proceeding under the provisions of the IndusWatersTreaty 1960.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Annex 2 provides details on the procedural developments in each of the ICSID Convention&#13;
and the Additional Facility Rules proceedings pending before the Centre in FY 2006.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PANELS OF CONCILIATORS AND OF ARBITRATORS&#13;
Pursuant to the ICSID Convention,the Centre maintains a Panel of Conciliators and a Panel&#13;
ofArbitrators.UnderArticle 13 of the Convention,each Contracting State may designate up&#13;
to four persons to each Panel who will serve for a renewable period of six years. Up to 10&#13;
persons may be designated to each Panel by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Panels provide a source from which parties may choose to select conciliators or arbitrators&#13;
for ICSID proceedings.In addition,when the Chairman of the ICSIDAdministrative Council&#13;
is called upon to appoint conciliators,arbitrators or ad hoc committee members underArticles&#13;
30,38 or 52 of the ICSID Convention,his appointees must be drawn from the Panels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During FY 2006, 13 Contracting States made designations to the ICSID Panels. These&#13;
included Azerbaijan,Chile,Colombia,Egypt,France,Guyana,Lebanon,Malawi,Mongolia,&#13;
Norway, Singapore, Slovak Republic and Switzerland.With these designations, there are&#13;
now 509 persons listed on the ICSID Panels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Details on the new designations made in the course of fiscal year 2006 are provided&#13;
in Annex 3. A complete list of all Panel members is posted on the ICSID website at&#13;

publishes materials on international and domestic law relating to foreign investment and&#13;
investment dispute settlement.Two new issues were published in the course of the year.&#13;
They featured articles on a number of current topics in the field such as the boundaries&#13;
of indirect expropriation; most-favored-nation treatment in investment arbitration; the&#13;
substance of nationality requirements in investment treaty arbitration; and certain global&#13;
implications of the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act. Texts of several recent decisions and&#13;
awards rendered in ICSID proceedings were also published with introductory notes&#13;
by ICSID counsel. The Model International Agreement on Investment for Sustainable&#13;
Development, drafted by the Institute for International Sustainable Development, was also&#13;
reproduced in one of these issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition, the Centre continued to maintain its multi-volume collections of Investment&#13;
Laws of the World and Investment Treaties. Three new releases for the Investment Treaties&#13;
collection were published during the year.These releases contained the texts of 60 bilateral&#13;
investment treaties concluded by 57 countries.The collection now comprises 1,080 such&#13;
treaties entered into by some 165 countries in the period 1959­2005.The Investment Laws&#13;
of theWorld collection presently features investment legislation and contact information for&#13;
the national investment agencies of 132 countries from all major regions of the world.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Two new issues of the Centre's newsletter, News from ICSID, were published in the course&#13;
of the year.The first of these issues reported on the 40th anniversary of the signing of the&#13;
ICSID Convention and on the appointment of PaulWolfowitz as the new Chairman of the&#13;
ICSIDAdministrative Council.The second issue featured an article on the role ofAlternative&#13;
Dispute Resolution (ADR) in investor-State dispute settlement. Further, the issue reported&#13;
on the new amendments to the ICSID Rules and Regulations, and on a high level&#13;
symposium which ICSID co-hosted with the OECD and UNCTAD in December 2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During FY 2006,the Centre published a new edition of the ICSID Rules and Regulations&#13;
and the ICSID Additional Facility Rules to reflect the amendments which took effect&#13;
on April 10, 2006. The ICSID four-volume publication entitled History of the ICSID&#13;
Convention was also reprinted in the period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Secretariat continued to maintain the Centre's website during the year,which provides&#13;
details on procedural developments in ICSID proceedings and on the Centre's institutional&#13;

Since 1983,ICSID has co-sponsored,with theAmericanArbitrationAssociation (AAA) and&#13;
the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC),&#13;
a series of annual colloquia on international arbitration.The 22nd in this series was hosted&#13;
by the AAA in NewYork City on November 18, 2005.The five sessions addressed current&#13;
institutional developments; international mediation, dispute resolution boards, fact-finding&#13;
and otherADR mechanisms in the field of international dispute resolution;impartiality and&#13;
independence in arbitration; and public policy issues in international arbitration involving&#13;
investment treaties. The interactive luncheon session focused on emerging and critical&#13;
issues in international arbitration.&#13;

FINANCE&#13;
The administrative expenditures were, again, covered by the World Bank pursuant to the&#13;
Memorandum ofAdministrativeArrangements concluded between the Bank and ICSID in&#13;
February 1967, and by fee income and income from the sale of publications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It is therefore not necessary to assess any excess expenditures on Contracting States pursuant&#13;
to Article 17 of the Convention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Expenditures relating to pending arbitration proceedings are borne by the parties in&#13;
accordance with ICSID's Administrative and Financial Regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Financial Statements of ICSID for FY 2006 are set forth in Annex 6.&#13;

&#13;
NOTE 1 ­ ORGANIZATION&#13;
The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre) was&#13;
established on October 14, 1966 to provide facilities for the conciliation and arbitration of&#13;
investment disputes between States and nationals of other States.The Centre provides such&#13;
facilitiesforcasesbroughtundertheICSIDConvention,theICSIDAdditionalFacilityRules,&#13;
or where parties involved so request, under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations&#13;
Commission on InternationalTrade Law.On February 13,1967,the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the Centre entered into Administrative&#13;
Arrangements which were effective as of the date of the establishment of the Centre.The&#13;
Memorandum of Administrative Arrangements (the Memorandum) provides that, except&#13;
to the extent that the Centre may charge the parties to proceedings,for fees and expenses of&#13;
members of Conciliation Commissions,ArbitralTribunals or ad hoc Committees,the Bank&#13;
shall provide facilities and services to the Centre,as described in Notes 2 and 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 ­ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES&#13;
Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation:The financial statements&#13;
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the&#13;
United States ofAmerica (US GAAP) and with International Financial Reporting Standards&#13;
(IFRS). Such financial statements are presented in accordance with Statement of Financial&#13;
Accounting Standard No. 117,"Financial Statements of Not-For-Profit-Organizations" (SFAS&#13;
No. 117). SFAS No. 117 requires that net assets are classified in accordance with donor&#13;
restrictions; however, there are no net assets as of June 30, 2006 and 2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Use of Estimates:The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP&#13;
and IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported&#13;
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date&#13;
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during&#13;
the reporting period.Actual results could differ from these estimates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Share in Pooled Cash and Investments: Amounts paid to the Centre, but not yet&#13;
disbursed, are managed by the Bank, which maintains a single investment portfolio (the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
50                                                                                        I C S I D&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                                       38040&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Pool) for all of the trust funds administered by the Bank, the International Development&#13;
Association,the International Finance Corporation,the Multilateral Investment Guarantee&#13;
Agency (the "World Bank Group"), and the funds of the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank maintains the Pool assets separate and apart from the funds of the World Bank&#13;
Group.Under the Pool's investment strategy adopted in January 2005,a significant portion&#13;
of the Pool is invested in liquid instruments such as money market deposits, U.S.Treasury&#13;
securities and other high-grade bonds.The pooled investments are reported at fair value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank maintains the investments on a pooled accounting basis. Share in Pooled Cash&#13;
and Investments represents the Centre's pro-rata share of the Pool's fair value at the end&#13;
of the reporting period.The fair value is based on market quotations, where available. If&#13;
quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of&#13;
comparable instruments.The corresponding proportionate realized and unrealized gains/&#13;
losses and interest income are accrued in the period in which they occur.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Value of Services Provided by the Bank and In-kind Contributions: In accordance&#13;
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 116, "Accounting for Contributions&#13;
Received and Contributions Made",the value of services provided by the Bank is determined&#13;
by the estimated fair value of these services and is recorded by the Centre as in-kind&#13;
contributions and also as expenses of the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Bank provides support services and facilities to the Centre including the following:&#13;
     (1) the services of staff members and consultants; and&#13;
     (2) other administrative services and facilities, such as travel, communications, office&#13;
          accommodations, furniture, equipment, supplies and printing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Revenue Recognition from Arbitration Proceedings: The Centre's direct expenses&#13;
attributabletoarbitrationproceedingsarebornebythepartiesinaccordancewiththeCentre's&#13;
Administrative and Financial Regulations (Regulations).These direct expenses include the&#13;
fees and travel expenses of arbitrators and the costs associated with engaging meeting rooms&#13;
and supporting services for conducting proceedings. In accordance with these Regulations,&#13;
the ICSID Secretary-General calls on the parties to make advance deposits with the Centre&#13;
from time to time to defray these anticipated expenses.Accordingly, the Centre recognizes&#13;
revenues from these exchange transactions during the period of and to the extent expenses&#13;
are incurred related to arbitration proceedings.The Centre also recognizes revenue for the&#13;
nonrefundable fees when collected from the parties to the arbitration proceedings.&#13;

Investment of Undisbursed Advances from Parties and Refund of Surplus to&#13;
the Parties: The investment income accrues to the parties and can be used for expenses&#13;
related to arbitration proceedings.After the completion of an arbitration proceeding, if it&#13;
is determined that there is an excess of advances and investment income over expenditures&#13;
for the proceedings, the surplus shall be refunded to the parties in proportion to the&#13;
amounts advanced by each party to the Centre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Accounting and Reporting Developments -- InternationalAccounting Standards&#13;
Board (IASB) Improvements Project: In December 2003,as a part of its improvements&#13;
project, the IASB issued fifteen revised standards to eliminate redundancies and conflicts&#13;
between existing standards.These revised standards are to be applied for annual periods&#13;
beginning on or after January 1, 2005.The revision did not have a material impact on the&#13;
Centre's financial reporting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other IASB Amendments: In December 2003, the IASB released revised IAS 32,&#13;
Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition&#13;
and Measurement. These standards replace IAS 32 (revised 2000), and supersede IAS 39&#13;
(revised 2000), and had to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1,&#13;
2005.The amendments did not have a material impact on the Centre's financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition to IAS 39 (Revised), further amendments were subsequently made to IAS&#13;
39, relating to (i) Transition and Initial Recognition of Financial Assets and Financial&#13;
Liabilities, (ii) Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of Forecast Intragroup Transactions, (iii) Fair&#13;
Value Hedge Accounting for a Portfolio Hedge of Interest rate Risk and (iv) the Fair&#13;
Value Option.The Centre is still evaluating the Fair Value Option amendment which is&#13;
applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1,2006,with specific transition&#13;
rules for existing IFRS preparers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The IASB issued IFRS 7, Financial Instrument: Disclosures, on 18 August 2005, with&#13;
complementary Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements ­ Capital&#13;
Disclosures.The Centre is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard which is&#13;
applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2007.&#13;

&#13;
New FASB Pronouncements: In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standard Board&#13;
(FASB) issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.This statement is&#13;
effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning&#13;
after December 15, 2005 and may have an impact on the Centre's financial reporting.As&#13;
this standard requires that, in the absence of specific transitional provisions applying to&#13;
a change in accounting policy (including adoption of a new standard), any such change&#13;
should be applied retroactively,it will affect ICSID's application and presentation of future&#13;
accounting changes in its financial reporting in future fiscal years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 3 ­ FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT&#13;
The Pool is actively managed and invested in accordance with the investment strategy&#13;
established for all trust funds administered by the World Bank Group.The objectives of&#13;
the investment strategy are foremost to maintain adequate liquidity to meet foreseeable&#13;
cash flow needs and preserve capital and then to maximize investment returns. The&#13;
Centre is exposed to market, credit, and liquidity risks. The risk management policies&#13;
employed to manage these risks are discussed below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Market risk ­ The risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of&#13;
changes in market prices or changes in interest rates.The Pool is actively managed so that&#13;
the probability of incurring negative returns over a three-year cycle is no more than 1%.&#13;
The asset allocation of the Pool is managed so as to optimize the Pool's total returns within&#13;
the specified risk tolerance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Credit risk ­ The risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an&#13;
obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.The Bank invests the pooled&#13;
assets in liquid instruments such as money market deposits, government and agency&#13;
obligations.The Bank is limited to investments with minimum credit ratings as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  n Money market deposits: issued or guaranteed by financial institutions whose senior&#13;
     debt securities are rated at least A-.&#13;
  n Government and agency obligations: issued or unconditionally guaranteed by&#13;
     government agencies rated at least AA- if denominated in a currency other than the&#13;
     home currency of the issuer, otherwise no rating is required. Obligations issued by an&#13;
     agency or instrumentality of a government, a multilateral organization or any other&#13;
     official entity require a minimum credit rating of AA-.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 6 (CONTINUED)&#13;
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Liquidity risk ­ The risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in raising liquid funds to&#13;
meet its commitments. ICSID regulations require parties to disputes to make advance&#13;
deposits with the Centre to meet anticipated expenses of arbitration proceedings. The&#13;
Bank maintains a significant portion of the Pool in short-term money market deposits to&#13;
meet disbursement requirements of trust funds.&#13;

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To:     International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We have audited the accompanying statements of financial position of the International Centre&#13;
for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre) as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related&#13;
statements of activities and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the&#13;
responsibility of the management of the Centre. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these&#13;
financial statements based on our audits.&#13;
&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United&#13;
States of America and International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan&#13;
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are&#13;
free of material misstatement. The Centre is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,&#13;
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. An audit includes consideration of internal&#13;
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the&#13;
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Centres&#13;
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also&#13;
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial&#13;
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,&#13;
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide&#13;
a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position&#13;
of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, and&#13;
the change in its net assets and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting&#13;
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and with International Financial&#13;
Reporting Standards.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This is the Annual Report on the
            operation of the International Centre for Settlement of
            Investment Disputes (ICSID) required by Article 6(1)(g) of
            the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
            between States and Nationals of Other States. This Annual
            Report covers the fiscal year July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006.
            In fiscal year 2006, the number of ICSID pending cases
            reached an all-time high of 118. The total number of
            conciliation and arbitration proceedings registered with the
            Centre since its inception rose to 210 with the addition of
            26 new arbitration cases instituted in the course of the
            fiscal year. The Secretariat continued its efforts to
            mitigate the impact of the significant caseload involving
            large and complex disputes by promoting more efficient ways
            of case management. During the year, ICSID's membership
            grew to 143 Contracting States following the ratification of
            the ICSID Convention by Syria.
