Preface&#13;
The primary aim of this study is to draw out knowledge, experience, and lessons from the best practice of the&#13;
Lodhran Pilot Project (LPP), and document this learning in a user-friendly format to promote easy replication and scaling&#13;
up. The findings of the study have been compiled into a toolkit to provide step-wise guidelines to practitioners,&#13;
politicians, technocrats, communities, social mobilizers, and local governments.&#13;
&#13;
In Pakistanâ&#128;&#148;as in most developing countries where resources are scarce, hygiene awareness low, and knowhow&#13;
limitedâ&#128;&#148;sanitation remains a relatively neglected sector. Sanitation is a concern for every household in society that&#13;
requires a partnership solution between communities and the local governments to be sustainable. This is particularly&#13;
so in peri-urban areas which are large enough to require sanitary networks and collective management but small&#13;
enough that urban complexities have not diminished the effectiveness of community partnerships.&#13;
&#13;
Traditionally, in Pakistan, sanitation projects have remained supply driven and infrastructure focused. As a result, even&#13;
after an investment of billions of rupees, access to safe sanitary facilities and its ultimate health impacts are limited.&#13;
Government spending has increased from 0.11 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2001â&#128;&#147;02 to 0.19 percent&#13;
in 2006â&#128;&#147;07. This is inadequate in a country where the cost of treating only diarrhea and typhoid is estimated to be&#13;
1.81 percent of GDP (World Bank), with a strong positive correlation with sanitation. In Pakistan, 60 percent of total&#13;
child mortality cases are caused by water- and sanitation-related diseases (USAID); 50 million people still practice open&#13;
defecation (Joint Monitoring Programme 2008) mostly in rural and peri-urban areas. Merely building toilets is not&#13;
enough to become open defecation free; the key is to raise awareness and change communitiesâ&#128;&#153; behavior. The&#13;
Lodhran Pilot Project is a successful model where raising awareness, motivating people, promoting collective&#13;
outcomes, and changing behavior are essential building blocks of a well-functioning, community-owned and managed,&#13;
sanitary system.&#13;
&#13;
Marked rural-urban variations occur in sanitation. For instance, in 2006, while 94 percent of the urban population had&#13;
improved or shared access to sanitation, only 45 percent of the rural population had such access. In Pakistan, the&#13;
culture of the masses is still largely rural despite strong urbanization. Many latrines are not sanitarily safe in rural areas,&#13;
mostly due to a lack of proper disposal mechanismsâ&#128;&#148;negatively impacting larger community efforts. The LPP model&#13;
seems a possible answerâ&#128;&#148;being a low-cost, component sharing, community-managed, â&#128;&#152;cradle to graveâ&#128;&#153; approach.&#13;
The LPP component sharing approach can also be a plausible model to address service provision of water and&#13;
sanitation in slums such that service providers could provide bulk services as â&#128;&#152;external componentâ&#128;&#153; and slum dwellers&#13;
could lay piping networks as â&#128;&#152;internal componentâ&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#148;thus easily separating services from tenure issues.&#13;
&#13;
This toolkit has been designed to be a handy guide for a diverse group that would be interested in replication or scale&#13;
up. It provides strategic insights into political realities and social triggers to motivate communities at large for thinking,&#13;
planning, and adapting collectively. In addition to technical implementation details and ideas on a socially enabling&#13;
framework, the toolkit also identifies critical elements for cultivating community leadership, and essential factors for&#13;
harmonizing community ownership and entrepreneurship.&#13;
&#13;
With a bleak sanitation outlook in Pakistan, the challenge of addressing sanitation is more of a hygiene and behavior&#13;
issue than that of infrastructure and investment. It lies more in the domain of individuals, households, and communities&#13;
rather than of donors and governments. The LPP approach revolves around this and hence stands out as an adoptable&#13;
and sustainable framework for peri-urban areas, slums, and rural settings.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Executive Summary&#13;
The Lodhran Pilot Project (LPP) was initiated in 1999. The first LPP interventions involved the construction of&#13;
low-cost sewerage networks in towns in southern Punjab. Now in its 10th year of operations, the project has&#13;
successfully demonstratedâ&#128;&#148;through on-ground implementationâ&#128;&#148;a low-cost, community-owned rural sanitation&#13;
model based on a participatory approach (component sharing). The LPP has till now adapted its approach for use&#13;
in small, rural communities in the districts of Lodhran, Rahim Yar Khan, Kasur, and Bahawalpur.&#13;
&#13;
The LPP has based its participatory low-cost sanitation model on the component sharing approach developed&#13;
earlier by the Orangi Pilot Project. In this model, the sanitation project is divided into (a) internal components:&#13;
community responsibility (sanitary latrine, household connection, and lane sewer); and (b) external components:&#13;
external agency (government, NGO, and so on) responsibility (main sewers and treatment or disposal works).&#13;
Rather than sharing the costs of the total system, the responsibility for components of service provision is clearly&#13;
allocated between the stakeholders involved. This creates a sense of ownership as community contributions are&#13;
substantial, often approaching 50 percent of the total scheme cost.&#13;
&#13;
The LPP found space for expanding its work within the political context of the new local government system after&#13;
2001, when the responsibility for local sanitation and hygiene service delivery was vested with the tehsil municipal&#13;
administrations (TMAs). Human and financial resources remained obstacles to deliver fully.&#13;
&#13;
Social mobilization was used as both an approach and a tool that enabled people to organize for collective action&#13;
by pooling resources and building solidarity, which was required to resolve common problems and work towards&#13;
community advancement. Village Sanitation Committees became a viable platform for facilitating citizen&#13;
participation together with the social mobilizer, attached with each field unit of the organization.&#13;
&#13;
The LPP team innovated with the technical design of its sanitation model to reduce costs, and attain higher&#13;
working efficiency to achieve better environmental results such as wastewater reuse.&#13;
&#13;
The rapid expansion of the project in southern Punjab has been due to the dynamism of the model under varying&#13;
political, socioeconomic, and physical landscapes. The project has now gained added significance since the&#13;
recently notified national and provincial sanitation policies, wider exchanges via SACOSAN, and the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
drive to meet its global commitments, such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).&#13;
&#13;
The success of the LPP has attracted more donors and its model has impacted even governmentsâ&#128;&#153; policy as the&#13;
provisions made in the recently promulgated national and provincial sanitation policies demonstrate.&#13;

&amp;#12;     BOX 2: Rationale for a Toolkit: Spreading the Success&#13;
&#13;
     The toolkit charts a storyline of the Lodhran Pilot Project (LPP) that is woven around the roles and actions of the three main&#13;
     project proponents:&#13;
     G   The Lodhran Pilot Project;&#13;
                                                                                                    â&#128;&#156;The LPP established itself on&#13;
     G   The community; and                                                                         a sound footing as it&#13;
     G   The government, that is, TMAs.                                                             emerged from within the&#13;
     The project model has been interpreted and explained in terms of its political,                community, having good&#13;
     administrative, technical, socioeconomic, and environmental content and resulting              political support. Its model&#13;
     implications. The LPP storyline toolkit has been broken down into sections that deal           was owned by the local&#13;
     with important project-related matter:                                                         government with some of the&#13;
                                                                                                    original LPP staff also being&#13;
     G   The LPP model;&#13;
                                                                                                    deputed to LPP from the&#13;
     G   Role of the community;                                                                     local government.â&#128;?&#13;
     G   Role of social mobilizers;                                                                 Perween Rahman, Director,&#13;
     G   Technical details or innovations;                                                          the Orangi Pilot Projectâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
                                                                                                    Research Training Institute&#13;
     G   Tools for monitoring and evaluation; and&#13;
     G   Skills transfer, capacity building, and so on.&#13;
     Some elements critical to the success of the project also find detailed attention. These include:&#13;
     G   Technical details that include pioneering technical innovations.&#13;
     G   Financial, administrative, and project documentation tools and mechanisms put in place to ensure effective monitoring&#13;
         and evaluation, and financial transparency.&#13;
     G   The agents of change that have emerged to mobilize communities have been identified and profiled to stress the&#13;
         importance of community-based social mobilization and the importance of communities taking ownership of the project&#13;
         to ensure long term sustainability of actions.&#13;
     Other than the project proponents, the toolkit is also useful for prospective donors, as a handy Guidebook, as they assess&#13;
     the merits or demerits and strengths or weaknesses of projects that require external support and funding in the relevant&#13;
     sphere of work.&#13;
     As the main objective behind the preparation of this toolkit is facilitation in the projectâ&#128;&#153;s upscaling and replication, the&#13;
     document does not cover within its scope a wide-ranging and in-depth assessment or evaluation of the project. Instead, it&#13;
     focuses on the model itself and highlights its adaptability and social dynamism. A model that is static or unbending does&#13;
     not lend itself to replication in scenarios that differ in certain respects to its own. The LPP has to therefore be recognized as&#13;
     a model capable of not only adapting to but also assimilating change. The toolkit talks about changeâ&#128;&#148;in behaviors,&#13;
     attitudes, and knowledge skills. Successful organizational initiatives create the need for changeâ&#128;&#148;a challenge for the leaders&#13;
     of an initiative is to provide people with the tools to embrace it. The toolkit is designed to help project leaders carry out&#13;
     initiatives that require changes in the way people work or in the culture in which they work. Within these parameters,&#13;
     however, the tools are adaptable to a wide range of endeavors.&#13;
     The toolkit therefore aims to find that delicate balance, while journeying through the LPP experience, which marks the&#13;
     boundary line between success and failure, as well as between feasibility and nonfeasibility, in implementing the LPP model.&#13;

&amp;#12;      Box 8: Linking and Networking&#13;
&#13;
      The Lodhran Pilot Project (LPP) model has proven its adaptability to change by networking and successfully linking up its&#13;
      work with other organizations and variable project needs. Some such examples are highlighted here:&#13;
      Finding Synergy with the CCB Model&#13;
      The LPP has been providing support to the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s devolution program ever since the promulgation of the LGO&#13;
      2001. After having witnessed an LPP project and having been impressed by its methodology and approach, the tehsil&#13;
      nazim of Kasur invited the LPP team to visit Kasur TMA and explore the possibility of linking up with a Citizen Community&#13;
      Boardâ&#128;&#153;s (CCBâ&#128;&#153;s) work in the tehsil. Subsequently, an agreement was signed between the LPP and Kasur TMA for&#13;
      execution of the sanitation scheme through the CCB based on the low-cost sanitation model of the LPP. The LPP&#13;
      provided technical support and, in consultation with the CCB, framed a comprehensive village improvement plan. Based&#13;
      on the recommendations of this plan, the scheme prepared by the CCB was approved by the Kasur tehsil council and&#13;
      work began, merging the management and financing system of the CCB with the low-cost, community-owned&#13;
      methodology of the LPP.&#13;
      The LPP office in Khanpur launched 12 sanitation schemes through engaging CCBs. The component of community&#13;
      mobilization, technical assistance, and designing was handled by the LPP, whereas the development grant was released&#13;
      by the TMAs/union councils.&#13;
      Using the District Government Grant through the LPP Model&#13;
      To resolve the sanitation issue in Khanpur tehsil, the district government of Rahim Yar Khan released a grant of Rs. 40&#13;
      million to Khanpur TMA with the understanding that the entire grant would be utilized to resolve sanitation issues in&#13;
      Khanpur by implementing technical methodologies of the LPP. In this way, while the internal components of the project&#13;
      were then financed by the community, the external components were funded by the government.&#13;

                       accidents, and so on. This demand-responsive                operational aspects of improved sanitation.&#13;
                       approach is much more likely to produce more&#13;
                       sustainable sanitation systems.&#13;
&#13;
 Community             The demand may exist but involving the communities in       The LPP experience has shown that, to ensure&#13;
 involvement           the effort for change is not an easy task. In motivating    long term sustainability of actions taken, it is&#13;
                       the communities to get involved, respected and              absolutely essential that from the communities,&#13;
                       influential community figures can persuade                  the local catalyst, or what can be termed as the&#13;
                       communities to trust and accept offers of cooperation       agent of change, emerges to lead and manage&#13;
                       from outside the community. These figures may be            the project with facilitation from the LPP.&#13;

&#13;
 Community             Once the community is motivated, the important step         In the LPP model, the Village Sanitation&#13;
 empowerment           of empowering them comes next. For this patience,           Committee (VSC) is the vehicle for organizing&#13;
                       consistency, and transparency are crucial. NGOs and         and empowering the communities. The&#13;
                       community-based groups can assume this role.                formation of the VSC indicates, according to the&#13;
                                                                                   LPP philosophy, that the sociological barrier&#13;

&#13;
 Community action      No one knows a community better than the people             The VSC again provides the forum for&#13;
                       who live there. Once their local knowledge has been         consultation, debate, training and capacity&#13;
                       blended with training and education on problem              building, decisionmaking, implementation, and&#13;
                       solving, they can become the best partners in the           monitoring. The LPP social engineer assists in&#13;
                       project implementation and monitoring process. This         breaking the technical and economic&#13;
                       ensures that the project initiatives are more durable,      barriers by providing feasible, applicable, and&#13;
                       more efficient, and better maintained.                      affordable technical designs and cost estimates.&#13;

  The LPP model has found success within a particular political and social contextâ&#128;&#148;a local government system that actively&#13;
  promoted private sector/community participation and communities facing more or less similar political, social, and financial&#13;
  challenges. However, for someone wishing to replicate the LPP approach and methodologies elsewhere in differing sociopolitical&#13;
  settings, it is important to identify some model and golden rules essential for social mobilization and transformation with reference&#13;
  to the LPP model, yet finding universal application. Discussed here are some key ingredients that would have to be fulfilled&#13;
  irrespective of the sociopolitical environment within which the venture is being attempted.&#13;

         longer time to mobilize but,&#13;
         once convinced, they prove the&#13;
         best partners.&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Only full involvement and&#13;
         ownership of the community&#13;
         can lead to sustainability of&#13;

&amp;#12;      My conclusion is that our people are willing&#13;
&#13;
      to be mobilized and it is in their interest. If&#13;
&#13;
      they do not do the development work they&#13;
&#13;
      suffer. To save both their health and&#13;
&#13;
      property, they have to make only a small&#13;
&#13;
      investment, which they do willingly.&#13;

            The Lodhran pilot project implementation
            toolkit : a participatory model for low-cost sanitation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The primary aim of this study is to draw
            out knowledge, experience, and lessons from the best
            practice of the Lodhran Pilot Project (LPP), and document
            this learning in a user-friendly format to promote easy
            replication and scaling. The findings of the study have been
            compiled into a toolkit to provide step-wise guidelines to
            practitioners, politicians, technocrats, communities, social
            mobilizers, and local governments. This toolkit has been
            designed to be a handy guide for a diverse group that would
            be interested in replication or scale up. It provides
            strategic insights into political realities and social
            triggers to motivate communities at large for thinking,
            planning, and adapting collectively. In addition to
            technical implementation details and ideas on a socially
            enabling framework, the toolkit also identifies critical
            elements for cultivating community leadership, and essential
            factors for harmonizing community ownership and
            entrepreneurship. There are four tools presented: The
            participatory development model, social mobilization,
            innovating and experimenting, and building capacity.
