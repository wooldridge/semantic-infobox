LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Country Overview and Macroeconomic Background&#13;
1.1   Peace was restored to El Salvador in 1989, and the 1992 Peace Accords formally&#13;
ended the 12-year civil war. The effort to consolidate the peace centers on the National&#13;
Reconstruction Plan (NRP) and the Peace Accords. The NRP is designed to lay the&#13;
foundation for national unity while creating the conditions for economic and social&#13;
recovery in the 115 municipalities most affected by the conflict. The plan's first&#13;
completed phase was designed to meet urgent needs in health, education, environment,&#13;
and democratic initiatives. The ongoing second five-year phase includes investments in&#13;
education and training, social services for low-income groups, infrastructure and&#13;
environmental management, and actions to strengthen democratic institutions, in&#13;
particular the judiciary and civilian police force. The Peace Accords also mandated&#13;
specific programs to support the economic and social reintegration of the demobilized&#13;
sectors and of the population most affected by the conflict, including land transfers.&#13;
1.2   El Salvador's economic performance since  1989 has been impressive.&#13;
Stabilization and adjustment programs and trade liberalization led to an estimated real&#13;
GDP growth of 7 percent for 1995. Inflation has been declining annually, and it is&#13;
estimated at 7.5 percent for 1995, down from 8.9 percent in 1994, 12 percent in 1993&#13;
and 20 percent in 1992. Other macroeconomic indicators are in line with LMF standby&#13;
targets. The 1995 current account deficit (excluding official grants) is projected at 2.8&#13;
percent of GDP, down from 3.7 percent of GDP in 1994. This downtum reflects a&#13;
slightly larger merchandise trade deficit (15.7 percent of GDP in 1995), which was more&#13;
than offset by private remittances (US$ 1.0 billion, equivalent to about 11 percent of&#13;
GDP in 1995). Overall fiscal performance for 1994 was significantly better than&#13;
programmed. The nonfinancial public sector deficit (excluding grants) is estimated at 2&#13;
percent of GDP for 1994. Successive administrations have reformed the public sector to&#13;
increase efficiency and foster private-sector growth.&#13;
1.3   Although El Salvador has skillfully managed the transition to democracy and&#13;
significantly improved its macroeconomic framework, it has much more to do to address&#13;
the largest potential obstacle to continued peace and economic growth: poverty. Poverty&#13;
reduction requires economic growth, particularly in agriculture. A prerequisite for&#13;
agricultural inv- tment is secure land tenure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
B. Agriculture, Rural Poverty, and Natural Resources&#13;
1.4   Agriculture is the most important sector in the economy. It generates 50 percent&#13;
of exports, one third of employment, and in 1994 it contributed about 9 percent of GDP.&#13;
The sector reacted strongly to economic adjustment, contributing to tl 'recovery with a&#13;
growth rate of 3.1 percent in 1991-94. This growth, however, only represented a&#13;
recovery to pre-1980 performance, and it has since declined owing to drought and (until&#13;
1994) falling coffee prices. Investment is badly needed to improve production methods&#13;
and diversify production so the sector can continue to grow. An Agriculture Sector&#13;
Strategy report is scheduled for joint execution with the Government and a Salvadoran&#13;
NGO. The report is to provide a wel: articulated diagnosis of the causes of the relatively&#13;
poor performance of agriculture and to develop a strategy to increase the sector's global&#13;
competitiveness, while simultaneously addressing the related issues of rural poverty and&#13;
environmental degradation.&#13;
1.5   Rural Poverty. Because 70 percent of the rural population rely on agriculture for&#13;
their livelihoods, increasing agricultural productivity is vital to generate employment and&#13;
raise rural incomes. The Poverty Assessment (Report 12315-ES, June 1994) found that&#13;
poverty is largely a rural phenomenon. While 48 percent of the population are classed as&#13;
poor and the urban/rural split is about even, the majority of poor (61 percent) and&#13;
extremely poor (67 percent) live in rural areas, largely due to skewed land ownership and&#13;
lack of employment opportunities. Eighty-seven percent of farms have fewer than 3&#13;
hectares and account for only 25 percent of the area under agricultural production. The 3&#13;
percent of farms larger than 30 hectares account for 44 percent of farmed area. This&#13;
inequality of land distribution means that much of the rural population requires off-farm&#13;
employment. However, seasonal jobs in coffee, cotton picking, and sugarcane cutting&#13;
have shrunk because of low coffee prices worldwide (until 1994), the abandonment of&#13;
cotton production due to declining competitiveness, and collectivization of sugar&#13;
plantations and other large holdings.&#13;
1.6   Natural Resources. Poverty and insecure land tenure have led to low investment&#13;
in agriculture, inadequate land management, and severe environmental degradation. The&#13;
Natural Resources Management Study (Report 12355-ES, January 1994) showed that&#13;
soil erosion, mainly from farming on slopes without mitigative measures, affects 75&#13;
percent of the country. Deforestation, topography, climate, and soils also contribute to&#13;
soil erosion. Improving land tenure would provide greater security for farmers who want&#13;
to invest in improved land management techniques or permanent crops.&#13;
C. Land Reform&#13;
1.7   The Government of El Salvador (GOES) recognized in the late 1970s that land&#13;
was a serious issue, but it sought to address the issue solely by redistribution, rather than&#13;
taking a more comprehensive view that would include improved incentives as well as&#13;
tenure security, land management, and raising agricultural productivity. About 275,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
hectares were distributed (about 14 percent of the country's area), but the reform&#13;
program paralyzed land markets, deterred investment, distorted incentives, and did little&#13;
to improve tenure security because many transfers could not be completed due to&#13;
incomplete land records.&#13;
1.8    The 1970s reform was to be implemented in three phases. Phase I expropriated&#13;
farms larger than 500 hectares to collectively owned cooperatives. Landowners were&#13;
compensated by agrarian reform bonds. The cooperatives were given 30 years to repay&#13;
the government at a rate of 6 percent a year with a four-year grace period. Phase II was&#13;
intended to expropriate farms in the range of 100-500 hectares, but it was virtually&#13;
annulled by the 1983 Constitution, which mandated a maximum holding size of 245&#13;
hectares and allowed excess holdings to be sold over two years. This phase was also&#13;
interrupted by the civil war. Phase III issued titles' to people who rented land or had&#13;
other informal contracts with landowners; 90 percent of beneficiaries received plots&#13;
smaller than 2 hectares, and landowners were again compensated with bonds. The&#13;
beneficiaries had the same repayment terms as the cooperatives. Phases I and Im&#13;
distributed 275,000 hectares to 533,000 beneficiary families.&#13;
D. The New Agrarian Policy&#13;
1.9    Recognizing the need to improve agricultural policy, combat poverty, and&#13;
increase employment and incomes through better land use and secure tenure, GOES&#13;
formulated a new agrarian policy in 1994. The Bank helped organize a land policy&#13;
options seminar in February 1994 so that the new policy could take into account the&#13;
views and needs of those involved in the agricultural sector. A wide range of&#13;
stakeholders participated, including representatives of political parties, small and large&#13;
agricultural producers, agricultural workers, universities, and nongovernmental&#13;
organizations. After the seminar, a Salvadoran agrarian policy working group drafted an&#13;
agrarian policy focusing on market-based incentives and poverty alleviation. This policy&#13;
was approved by the highest government authorities as the policy context for the&#13;
proposed project. Another seminar, in which the Bank also participated in May 1994,&#13;
discussed international experience in land registry2 and cadastral3 systems. A further&#13;
seminar, on alternative conflict resolution methods, was jointly delivered in March 1995&#13;
by the Ministry of Justice and the Bank.&#13;
1. "Title" is an instrnment, such as a deed, that is evidence of a right.&#13;
2 . A "land registry" is the official record book that carries the entry of ownership rights, or title, and&#13;
encumbrances on these rights.&#13;
3. "Cadastral" is of or related to a cadastre, an official register of the quantity, value, and ownership&#13;
of real estate used in apportioning taxes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4-&#13;
1.10 The new agrarian policy aims to (a) finalize, as quickly and efficiently as possible,&#13;
the land transfers agreed on in the Peace Accordse and complete the parcelizations&#13;
requested by agrarian reform cooperatives; (b) ensure security of tenure to promote&#13;
investment and enable transfer of land; (c) streamline state agrarian reform institutions;&#13;
(d) consolidate and restructure agrarian debt; (e) create a free market for land to&#13;
facilitate access and create employment opportunities for the rural poor; and (f) design&#13;
and install an efficient rural finance system.&#13;
(a)   Finalizing Land Transfers. The two ongoing land transfer programs have&#13;
suffered delays. The Peace Accord land transfers were speeded up in May&#13;
1994, and legislation approved in September 1994 enabled the distribution&#13;
of land coupons to beneficiaries in lieu of direct government adjudication.&#13;
Distribution was stalled, however, by a lack of clear rights to holdings. In&#13;
November 1994 the Land and Mortgage Registry (Registro de la&#13;
PropiedadRaiz e Hipotecas-RPRH), the Social Land Registry (Registro&#13;
Social de Inmuebkes-RSI) and the Liberty and Progress Institute&#13;
(Instituto Libertad y Progreso-ILP) were assigned to help accelerate&#13;
titling and registration, and in January 1995 the Bank approved a Project&#13;
Preparation Facility (PPF P-264-ES) for US$2 million to support this&#13;
process by financing land titling, registry, and cadastral activities.&#13;
(b)   Ensuring Tenure Security. The proposed project is designed to implement&#13;
the new agrarian policy's tenure security plank. It would consolidate and&#13;
modernize land registry and the cadastre, drawing on a pilot land registry&#13;
and cadastre subproject financed under the 1993 Agricultural Sector&#13;
Reform and Investment Program (PRISA) project (Loan 3576-ES) in the&#13;
Department of Sonsonate. The pilot involves the following:&#13;
(i)    Land registry activities covering over 100,000 hectares-including&#13;
aerial photography, field updating of the land registry and cadastre&#13;
(regularization), including mechanisms for alternative dispute&#13;
resolution in cases of conflicting land claims and establishment of&#13;
a consolidated legal and cadastral registry office in Sonsonate and&#13;
data stations in several municipalities. These activities have been&#13;
completed in two municipalities (about 5,800 hectares). The&#13;
findings from these municipalities were used to design the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
(ii)    A study of legal and institutional requirements to combine national&#13;
land registry and cadastre information in single records within the&#13;
newly created National Registry Center (CNR) under the Ministry&#13;
of Justice and keep the records updated after regularization.&#13;
4. The 1992 Peace Accords committed the government to distribute 166,000 hectares to 47,500&#13;
excombatants and squatters by December 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(c)   Streamlining State Agrarian Reform Institutions. The government is&#13;
consolidating its three agrarian reform agencies into the Land Bank,&#13;
which is implementing the Peace Accord land transfers.&#13;
(d)   Consolidating and Restructuring Agrarian Debt. A proposal has been&#13;
drafted to consolidate and restructure agrarian debt by transferring it to&#13;
the tax-collection sector of the Treasury and linking it to property rather&#13;
than debtors. Collection would be similar to that of taxes, and incentives&#13;
would be given to speed the resolution of debt, including discounts for&#13;
those who pay on time.&#13;
(e)   Creating a Free Market for Land. GOES has approved changes that&#13;
would allow agrarian reform beneficiaries to sell or rent their land to&#13;
anyone; existing law limits such transfers to agrarian reform beneficiaries&#13;
or landless peasants. This limitation has reduced land demand to a low-&#13;
income market, leading to lower prices and illegal transactions.&#13;
(f)   Designing and Installing an Efficient Rural Finance System. The Bank's&#13;
September 1993 Second Structural Adjustment Loan (3646-ES) and an&#13;
IDB grant of US$3 million are supporting mral finance reforms. In June&#13;
1994 the government submitted to the Bank and IDB an action plan that&#13;
is now being implemented.&#13;
1.11  In April 1991 the Legislature enacted a law allowing Phase I agrarian reform&#13;
beneficiaries to opt for individual land tenure rights (rather than ownership by the&#13;
cooperative), base on findings that yields on lands affected under Phase III-which&#13;
required individual ownership---.re substantially higher than under Phase I cooperative&#13;
ownership. In 1995 the Presides. .pproved measures allowing cooperatives to sell part&#13;
of their land to repay their agrarian debt (see para. 1. O(e)). The proposed project would&#13;
assist agrarian reform and Peace Accord property owners in voluntarily parceling their&#13;
holdings under optional property regimes.&#13;
E. Land Registry and Cadastral Institutions&#13;
1.12  Three institutions have been involved in land mapping, cadastre, and&#13;
registration-the National Geographic Institute (Instituto Geogrdfico Nacional: IGN),&#13;
the RPRH and its subsidiary the RSI. The proposed project would support the&#13;
government in consolidating, reforming, and streamlining these agencies to create a&#13;
single land registry under the new National Registry Center (Centro Nacional de&#13;
Registros: CNR). Property legal records need to be updated and unified to the cadastre&#13;
to ensure reliable registration of property titles. For a detailed institutional analysis, see&#13;
Annex A.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
1.13 The government created CNR in December 1994 by executive decree, merging&#13;
RPRH, RSI, and IGN for the purpose of institutionalizing RSI's success. Prior to&#13;
negotiations, the Legislature approved Decree No. 462 on October 5, 1995,&#13;
consolidating the functions of RPRH, RSI, and IGN and bringing the functions and the&#13;
responsibility for land registry, regularization, and cadastre under one institution, the&#13;
CNR. The legislative decree also dictates that the CNR must establish tariffs&#13;
guaranteeing self-financing and bars fee waivers. The Legislature must approve tariff&#13;
changes.&#13;
1.14 The cadastre lies with IGN, which is also in charge of national cartography. The&#13;
cadastre is the physical parcel registry, but it was last (and only partially) updated in the&#13;
late 1970s.  IGN has 11 departmental offices.  There has been little functional&#13;
relationship between the cadastre and the registry, and one of the objectives of the&#13;
project would be to overcome problems resulting from this lack of coordination.&#13;
1.15 RPRH's system is essentially a nineteenth century Napoleonic Civil Code system,&#13;
a deed registry that is grantee-based rather than land-based (folio personal rather than&#13;
folio reaI).' The RPRH is a public registry with 10 departmental offices. RPRH&#13;
procedures are not transparent, providing registrars ample discretion to reject or delay&#13;
registration applications. All RPRH operations are manual because the institution lacks&#13;
the resources to acquire modern equipment and the procedures to respond to increasing&#13;
demand for diversified services, including land distribution programs, new settlements,&#13;
and urban sprawl. In spite of surplus revenues, low salaries levels and other internal&#13;
problems have driven many of RPRH's qualified staff away, and the quality of its service&#13;
is low and unreliable.&#13;
1.16 RPRH has become so unsuited to modern circumstances that the government&#13;
itself was obliged to bypass it by creating (in 1991) RSI under RPRH to register titles in&#13;
squatter settlements. RSI uses an automated folio real system. RSI's purview was&#13;
expanded in 1994 to the plots distributed under the Peace Accords, and the anpliaci6n&#13;
or transactions requiring boundary changes, e.g. housing developments and parcel&#13;
fragmentations, raising the demand for RSI services some 40 percent, particularly from&#13;
institutions financing housing developments.&#13;
F. Constraints in Land Registry and Cadastral Services&#13;
1.17  El Salvador's land registry and cadastral system suffers from out-of-date land&#13;
records, an inappropriate legal and institutional framework, and low managerial capacity.&#13;
1.18  Land records are updated by RPRH and RSI, and cadastral records by IGN. The&#13;
institutional arrangement between RPRH and IGN for providing and verifying cadastral&#13;
information is dysfunctional. Only about 40 percent of El Salvador's properties are&#13;
S. Except San Salvador, which uses thefolio real system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
registered, and of those, less than a third have cadastral references (see para. 1.23). Many&#13;
properties with valid registrations cannot be located. Property owners with title&#13;
certificates that are not registered cannot use their titles as security for mortgages or&#13;
other collateral. Some properties are registered by municipalities, but this practice does&#13;
not guarantee their legal rights before third parties.&#13;
1.19 RPRH's legal and institutional inadequacy became a critical issue, given the need&#13;
to formalize rights in squatter settlements resulting from war and urban in-migration. Its&#13;
procedures for inscription are cumbersome, and it has no standardized deed format&#13;
requirements. Procedures were also hampered because RPRH had to verify payment of&#13;
wealth and estate taxes. Registration is not obligatory, and despite the legal security it&#13;
provides, substantial transaction costs were stacked against registering land. The&#13;
abolition of the wealth and estate taxes has eliminated some of these barriers, although&#13;
the Land Registry must still collect evidence of payment of the less onerous municipal&#13;
taxes and personal transit fee (Vialidad 'C'). A draft law is before the legislature to&#13;
abolish these requirements.&#13;
1.20  RSI-the registry pilot for CNR's future land registry operations-is more agile&#13;
than RPRH, and it is allowed to retain its fee revenues to buy equipment and hire higher-&#13;
paid staff. After four years of operation, RSI's number of inscriptions is up to 40 percent&#13;
that of RPRH (even recording cadastral data, unlike RPRH), with a third of the staff and&#13;
only three locations. Its records are folios reales, automated and can be computer&#13;
searched by owner name or parcel location. In addition to automation, RSI has two other&#13;
innovative features: massive registration, because it was designed to address the needs of&#13;
squatter settlements, and a requirement to present plat drawings to complete the land&#13;
record. RSI can also control its work flow, because it is permitted to set priorities among&#13;
potential clients and does not have a backlog, which reduces document losses. This&#13;
feature will be retained under the proposed project; registration priority will be assigned&#13;
before accepting registration requests and supporting documentation helping also&#13;
minimize documents losses.&#13;
G. Lessons from Past Operations&#13;
1.21   For more than two decades the Bank has been involved in land reform and land&#13;
tenure issues under its poverty-oriented rural development strategy. In 1975 the Bank&#13;
published a land reform paper. Evaluation of projects in Thailand and Kenya6 and recent&#13;
experience suggest that land reform programs are most cost-effective and contribute to&#13;
equity objectives when they are areawide and combined with agile conflict-resolution&#13;
mechanisms. The projects showed that land titling is an important step in increasing rural&#13;
productivity in areas where (a) population densities are high; (b) freehold tenure is a&#13;
reality; (c) traditional systems of land allocation and dispute adjudication have broken&#13;
down; and (d) formal credit systems are willing and able to lend to small farmers against&#13;

Challenges." This paper was prepared for the World Bank Agricultural Sector Symposium, 1994.,&#13;

the security of land titles. Except for the credit link-which is being addressed under the&#13;
SAL II Project (see para. 1.10(f)) and the Agricultural Sector Strategy Study (see para.&#13;
1.4)-these conditions accurately describe the situation in El Salvador. There is&#13;
significant synergy between titling and credit, and titling land can lead to productivity&#13;
increases from better access to formal credit.&#13;
1.22 A review of World Bank experience with rural titling projects throughout the&#13;
world reported that, except for the Thailand Land Titling I and II projects (Loans 2440-&#13;
TH and 3254-TH, respectively), the 12 operations surveyed performed poorly.7 The&#13;
main problems were: lack of political support; conflicting bureaucratic priorities; lack of&#13;
institutional capacity or support; and complex multiple objectives of which titling was&#13;
only an adjunct. By contrast, the Thailand projects were relatively successful due to: full&#13;
political and institutional support; Government commitment to adequate resources; single&#13;
titling objective; and relatively favorable land policy environment. The mutual&#13;
cooperation between the Land Agency and the World Bank must also be considered a&#13;
factor of the success so far. The proposed project is also characterized by full political,&#13;
institutional and financial support, single land regularization objective, a favorable&#13;
agrarian policy environment, as well as successful pilot experience, as described below.&#13;
1.23  The proposed project draws lessons from the beginning of implementation of the&#13;
pilot project under PRISA (Loan 3576-ES) which covered 5,800 hectares in the&#13;
Sonsonate Department municipalities of Santa Catarina Mazahaut and Santo Domingo&#13;
Guzman. This first phase showed that the registration program was highly popular, and&#13;
enhanced when adequate local publicity was given before visits by field teams. It also&#13;
demonstrated the effectiveness of the mapper/notary field verification teams, but showed&#13;
up institutional weaknesses that led to slow data entry, underscoring the need to&#13;
streamline and computerize the CNR. It also provided the first set of hard data on the&#13;
magnitude of the problem and target group. Based on data from these municipalities,&#13;
GOES estimates that, at most, about 40 percent of properties nationwide are registered,&#13;
and less than a third have cadastral references; of the unregistered parcels, most were&#13;
small (76 percent of the urban were below 500 m2 and 91 percent of the rural were below&#13;
3 hectares). This data confirmed the poverty reduction potential of the proposed project.&#13;
(see Annex CI). Furthermore, the pilot experience in cost minimization yielded much&#13;
lower costs per hectare for the proposed project than recent similar experiences in East&#13;
Asia (see Annex E5).&#13;
1.24  Finally, .he project also draws from the experiences of the Peace Accord&#13;
mandated land transfers, financed mainly by USAID and the European Union. These&#13;
transfers were delayed due to deficiencies in the legislation and in registry records. Once&#13;
the CNR was included in the land transfer effort -financed by a US$ 2.0 million Project&#13;
Preparation Facility (PPF-264-ES), two transitory decrees allowed streamlined&#13;
procedures for adverse possession and other preventive annotations that allowed&#13;
registration.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Origins of the Project&#13;
2.1   The proposed project is based on the agrarian policy dialogue and the first phase&#13;
of its 1994 pilot subproject under PRISA. As emerged from the agrarian policy dialogue,&#13;
the Government of El Salvador (GOES) realized that land administration problems were&#13;
among the largest challenges facing the country, as made evident by delays in Peace&#13;
Accord mandated land transfers (see para. 1.10). Moreover, the GOES realized that land&#13;
tenure insecurity was one of the brakes preventing investment and modernization of the&#13;
agricultural sector as well as better management of the natural resource base. The&#13;
critical role of legally secure land ownership in El Salvador's peace consolidation and&#13;
environmental management was set out in the Country Assistan,ce Strategy (CAS, Report&#13;
P-6108-ES). The review invoked the need to establish a comprehensive land titling and&#13;
registration program to provide the foundations for a modem land market. The 1994&#13;
Poverty Assessment (Report 12315-ES) pointed out the need to increase the poor's&#13;
access to assets through strengthening the agencies responsible for land financing, titling,&#13;
and registration. The pilot project under PRISA provided a catalytic experience&#13;
convincing the GOES that modernization of the land registry and cadastre could be done&#13;
within reasonable cost parameters (see para. 1.23). To backstop these findings, under&#13;
PPF 264-ES, the project supported land regularization and registration of Peace Accords&#13;
land transfers.&#13;
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.2   The proposed project is fully consistent with the the Bank's Group's CAS&#13;
discussed by the Board on September 14, 1993, including support for land transfers&#13;
mandated by the Peace Accords. This project would modernize the public land registry&#13;
and cadastral services under a streamlined agency with full financial sustainability;&#13;
alleviate poverty by addressing the needs of smallholders without land security so they&#13;
can sell and rent at full price and use land registered titles as collateral; enable private&#13;
sector growth by allowing investments on land obtaining secure tenure; and strengthen&#13;
natural resource and environmental management by providing the security needed for&#13;
longer-horizon investment decisions. The Bank has been supporting the Government in&#13;
three key areas leading to the proposed project: agrarian policy formulation, Peace&#13;
Accords land transfers and the pilot project under PRISA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
C. Project Objectives&#13;
2.3    The proposed project's major objectives are to regularize' land registration for El&#13;
Salvador's estimated 1.6 million parcels9 of rural and urban land and to create an&#13;
efficient, streamlined, and financially self-sustaining nationwide cadastral mechanism for&#13;
mapping and land registration-the new National Registry Center. Land registration&#13;
would provide land owners-particularly the vast majority of smallholders who lack clear&#13;
tenure-with the security that will enable them to sell or rent at fair market prices, and&#13;
pass on their holdings as inheritances. Improving tenure security would also increase&#13;
smallholder access to credit, raising incentives to invest and to manage land properly.&#13;
D. Project Description&#13;
2.4    The El Salvador Land Administration project would finance a six-year, US$70&#13;
million program (including US$14.0 million in physical and price contingencies) to (a)&#13;
consolidate, strengthen, and decentralize the CNR so that it can keep records updated;&#13;
(b) acquire land data to regularize the national land registry and cadastre; and (c) carry&#13;
out project administration. The project would cover all 14 departments of El Salvador.&#13;
The project design draws lessons from pilot project now being carried out based on field&#13;
work in Sonsonate Department under the PRISA project (Loan 3576-ES) (For a detailed&#13;
description of the pilot program, see Annex C).&#13;
Institutional Strengthening and Decentralization&#13;
2.5    This component (US$10.6 million) would include two subcomponents (for a&#13;
detailed description of the component, see Annex B).&#13;
(a)   Institutional Strengthening   (US$6. 1. million).  This subcomponent&#13;
would finance civil works rehabilitation, vehicles, equipment, furniture&#13;
and recurrent costs on a declining basis to consolidate and strengthen the&#13;
CNR, by merging RPRH/RSI, and IGN headquarters offices into a single&#13;
CNR headquarters. Prior to negotiations, the Legislature has approved a&#13;
satisfactory law to effect the institutional merge into CNR (Decree No.&#13;
462, dated October 5, 1995), and the Government has submitted a&#13;
satisfactory time-bound action plan (see Annex B1). Among the functions&#13;
to be strengthened during the CNR consolidation plan are the defining of&#13;
accounting norms and procedures, staffing and skills mix, management&#13;
information systems (see para. 4.17), fee and revenue-sources&#13;
diversification and marketing (see Annex B6), and training. On January&#13;
25, 1996 the Legislature approved changes in the Cadastre Law to make&#13;
s Land regularization makes ownership rights public knowledge by perfecting registration procedures&#13;
and making all records public.&#13;
9  It is estimated that there are 1.8 million parcels in El Salvador. This 1.6 million estimate excludes&#13;
the estimated 200,000 parcels in Sonsonate, which are being regularized under PRISA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
registration obligatory. In addition the Government has scheduled to&#13;
disseminate guidelines spelling out obligations of notaries and registars&#13;
with respect to standardizing documentation for registration after&#13;
regularization by mid- 1996.&#13;
The subcomponent would also provide training and technical assistance to&#13;
install staff from these agencies into their new functions and backstop&#13;
CNR's new activities. The consolidation of the CNR requires upgrading&#13;
its staff to respond rapidly to the transition to new functions and work&#13;
methods. The project would support training to adapt RPRH/RSI and&#13;
IGN staff skills to the new integrated legal and cadastral records and to&#13;
the computerized management of land information. A training plan is&#13;
included in Annex B2. The subcomponent would also provide technical&#13;
assistance to establish a national automated land information system&#13;
(LIS) by expanding the one being established under the pilot program.&#13;
The LIS is an automated database being designed under the PRISA&#13;
project to identify owners, parcels, and their descriptions, rights, and&#13;
encumbrances. The entries will be geographically referenced using&#13;
information obtained in the photogrammetric process. Each parcel will&#13;
have a unique identifier and records. The system would keep track of all&#13;
supporting documentation required to establish, change, or extinguish real&#13;
rights. The CNR land registry would receive the verified files obtained&#13;
under the land data acquisition component for registration.&#13;
(b)   Institutional Decentralization (US$4.5 million). This component would&#13;
finance civil works, rehabilitation, vehicles, equipment, furniture and&#13;
recurrent costs on a declining basis to decentralize CNR's legal and&#13;
cadastral services in regional offices. The implementation phase following&#13;
the consolidation would decentralize CNR functions to one central office&#13;
and three regional offices. The headquarters/Central Region office will be&#13;
in San Salvador and the regional offices in Sonsonate for the Western&#13;
Region, San Vicente for the Northern Region and San Miguel for the&#13;
Eastern region (depending on the availability of reliable telephone trunk&#13;
lines or radio communications). Out of these four offices land registry and&#13;
cadastre operations will be further decentralized to 52 municipal offices.&#13;
To compensate for reducing the number of field offices from 10 RPRH&#13;
offices and 11 IGN offices into 4 CNR regional offices, the proposed&#13;
location plan would provide the following:&#13;
(i)    An electronic network linking the 52 groups of five to six&#13;
municipalities, connecting all 262 municipalities in El Salvador.&#13;
The users would have access to the most common and simple&#13;
services ( i.e., land records consultation and certification-read-&#13;
only services-reception windows for service requests and, for&#13;
the larger municipalities, document submission).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
(ii)    One-stop windows at each of the four regional offices offering a&#13;
complete menu of services, including verification and recordation&#13;
of instruments elaborated by private notaries and topographers.&#13;
Cadastral staff in the regional offices would revise parcel&#13;
delimitations to reflect boundary changes.   The proposed&#13;
functions of the national, regional, and municipal offices are&#13;
described in Annex B.&#13;
Land-Data Acquisition&#13;
2.6   The land-data acquisition component (US$48.7 million) would carry out the&#13;
barrido, that is, establish new land information for cadastral purposes, verify and&#13;
regularize land rights on identified parcels, consolidate the data for input in the LIS (see&#13;
para. 2.5(a)), and establish mechanisms to resolve conflicts. The component would be&#13;
divided into three subcomponents: (a) mapping; (b) land records regularization, and (c)&#13;
alternate dispute resolution mechanisms (for a detailed description of the component, see&#13;
Annex D):&#13;
(a)   Mapping (US$15.1 million). This subcomponent would finance works&#13;
and technical assistance to assist the government in conducting mapping&#13;
activities to establish a parcel-based database describing every parcel's&#13;
legal rights, geographic location, and boundary lines. These activities&#13;
would include aerial photography at scales of 1/20,000 for rural areas and&#13;
1/4,000 for urban areas, using a global positioning system (GPS). The&#13;
photogrammetric, digital information would be used to produce base&#13;
maps for field verification at scales of 1/5,000 for rural areas, 1/2,000 for&#13;
periurban areas, and 1/1,000 for urban areas. Areas not clearly captured in&#13;
the aerial photography would be subjected to topographic complementary&#13;
surveys to complete basic maps. The subcomponent would finance&#13;
technical assistance to train IGN photogrammetry staff on numeric&#13;
restitution and using GPS equipment (also see TORs in Annex DI).&#13;
(b)   Land Records Regularization (US$35.4 million including the $2 million&#13;
PPF). While base maps are being produced, this subcomponent would&#13;
finance  information  campaigns,   training, local consultants, and&#13;
incremental recurrent costs to carry out the steps described below, as well&#13;
as the completion of the Sonsonate pilot program. '0 The updating of this&#13;
information after regularization would be ensured by legislative changes&#13;
that make registration by notaries compulsory and universal. (see&#13;
Paragraph 2.5 (a)). During negotiations, the GOES has agreed to&#13;
maintain a legal registry and cadastral framework satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
(see para. 5.2(a)).&#13;
'° These are not cost overruns; the financing available for the pilot in PRISA (US$5.6 million) was&#13;
substantially below the required to complete the pilot (US$8.5 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
*  Research and input every registry book to establish parcel-based files&#13;
to start the conversion from folio personal to folio real. This work&#13;
consists of identifying current records with their annotations;&#13;
identifying cadastral references, if they exist; and establishing a data&#13;
base with parcel-based files (see TORs in Annex D3).&#13;
*  Carry  out national and  local publicity  campaigns, with  the&#13;
participation of mayors, to announce the upcoming arrival of field&#13;
teams and their purpose.&#13;
*  Field verify geographic boundaries and legal rights with existing&#13;
records in newly-established file, seeking confirmation with neighbors.&#13;
Under the US$2 million PPF this task was carried out prior to titling&#13;
Peace Accord land transfers. Under the proposed project, this effort&#13;
would be carried out by local consultants and IGN staff who would&#13;
visit every parcel with the updated area-based map and parcel-based&#13;
files on every parcel identified in the aerial photo. As in the pilot phase&#13;
in Sonsonate, each field verification team would be composed of a&#13;
trained photoidentifier and a fourth-year law student; they would each&#13;
verify boundaries and the type and accuracy of property&#13;
documentation (certificates of adverse possession, private and public&#13;
deeds, titles or other instruments) together with the parcel holder (see&#13;
TORs in Annex D2).&#13;
Hire notaries in each municipality to supervise legal aspects of field&#13;
verification (e.g., note discrepancies in the legal or physical&#13;
descriptions of properties and create documents when needed). The&#13;
project would provide notaries training in dispute resolution&#13;
techniques (see (c) below, and Annex C, paras. 20-22).&#13;
*  Desk-verify legal and physical information in parcel-based files, assign&#13;
it a unique cadastral number, and submit for final registration in the&#13;
CNR's automated land registry (LIS). This activity would provide the&#13;
building blocks of the new national legal cadastral map. Parcel-based&#13;
files that present discrepancies between the documentation and legal&#13;
inscription or physical description would be provisionally registered.&#13;
Title holders would be advised of the assignation of the parcel number&#13;
after the effort is completed.&#13;
*  Train staff and local consultants to carry out the field and&#13;
regulariza;on activities (photoidentifiers, law students, notaries, and&#13;
land registrars).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
(c)   Alternate Dispute Resolution Mechanisms (USso.1 million). This&#13;
particular subcomponent would finance technical assistance, an&#13;
information campaign and training field notaries and other staff in&#13;
alternate (nonjudicial, judicial and administrative) dispute resolution&#13;
mechanisms. Rights to some parcels are expected to be unclear or&#13;
contested. These properties would be subject to, at the request of&#13;
concerned parties, a mediation process. If agreement is reached under&#13;
mediation or other means, the notary could formalize the parties'&#13;
agreement,1' or request confirmation by local judges or justices of the&#13;
peace.&#13;
2.7   Because the component is national in scope, the government would submit to the&#13;
Bank evidence of agreement by neighbor country (on both area and activity) prior to&#13;
initiating any project activity in corresponding border area.(see para 5.2 (e)).&#13;
Project Administration&#13;
2.8   This third component (US$8.7 million) would finance the project's management,&#13;
including vehicles and equipment, technical assistance and training, and incremental&#13;
recurrent costs. The project would finance the operation and expansion of the executing&#13;
unit (Unidad Ejecutora-UE), which was created to manage the pilot program under&#13;
PRISA. It has proven extremely effective, but it will need strengthening to take on the&#13;
proposed project (see Annex E4). The UE would be in charge of managing information&#13;
campaigns and communications. In each region, the UE will contract out work to firms&#13;
and will supervise the firms and their implementation of the project. A monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system for the project established under PRISA will be expanded for this&#13;
project (see para. 4.18). The UE would be responsible also for auditing requirements and&#13;
hiring external auditors (for a detailed description of the component, see Annex E).&#13;
2.9   Because of the national project's complexity, the UE would include a Quality&#13;
Control Team at least with two main consultants in charge of technical implementation&#13;
and training (see TORs in Annex El) before June 30, 1996 (see para. 5.2(d)). The&#13;
complexity arises from the need to integrate and unify technical and legal procedures and&#13;
manage dovetailed operations in different locations and time frames. The team would&#13;
supervise fieldwork of contract firms and be in charge of following up the&#13;
implementation of project activities by the consultant teams. The Quality Control Team&#13;
would report to the head of the UE.&#13;
2.10  Most of the technical assistance and training to be provided under the project is&#13;
related to skills not available in the government in sufficient depth or quantity.&#13;
Intemational technical assistance (i.e., photogrammetry, land information systems) is to&#13;
be used mainly for developing system design and training local users. Local technical&#13;
11. Under the law of voluntary jurisdiction (see Annex H).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
assistance refers to skills in ample supply in the private sector (topographers, notaries) to&#13;
handle outsourced volume services that will not increase the size of the public sector.&#13;
E. Program Objectives Categories&#13;
2.11   The project would indirectly support the private-sector development objective by&#13;
enhancing property rights and by financing outsourced activities. It is expected that the&#13;
land security provided by regularized titles and well-defined boundaries will increase&#13;
incentives for investment and land management. The project is included in the Bank's&#13;
program of targeted interventions against poverty because a significant majority of its&#13;
beneficiaries would be among El Salvador's rural poor (see para. 1.23 and Annex C1).&#13;
F. Sustainability&#13;
2.12  Participatory processes have and will continue to support project preparation and&#13;
implementation and have been designed for financial self-sustainability. Three seminars&#13;
(Land Policy Options, Registry and Cadastre Experiences and Alternative Conflict&#13;
Resolution Mechanisms) were held during preparation with a wide range of Government&#13;
and nongovernment participants. Prior to the pilot project field work, broad information&#13;
campaigns and consultations with elected Mayors were conducted. Such consultations&#13;
will continue throughout project implementation and are expected to sustain government&#13;
commitment. Moreover, the project is designed to make the new National Registry&#13;
Center financially self-sustaining. The Legislature has approved CNR autonomy including&#13;
self-financing by its ability to allow CNR to retain the revenues it collects and bar any fee&#13;
waiver. A cash-flow study carried out for the project shows that the fees to be collected&#13;
by CNR will be sufficient to defray its costs, including those for servicing the Bank loan&#13;
(see Annex B5). The study also shows anticipated revenue and expense streams under&#13;
that study's base case, beginning with its 1994 experimental phase under PRISA. On the&#13;
demand side, initial parcel-based land regularization, while compulsory, will be free; CNR&#13;
fees-which are now set at levels which allow for self-sustainability-are expected to&#13;
increase under universal registration of land transfers, as coverage increases.&#13;
G.   Environmental Issues&#13;
2.13  The project has been rated 'C" because it would not have negative environmental&#13;
effects and is expected to contribute to better land management. In the Bank's Natural&#13;
Resources Management Study (Report No. 12355-ES), soil erosion was identified as one&#13;
of El Salvador's main environmental problems (see para. 1.6). By improving land&#13;
security for owners and renters, the project should improve farmer incentives to apply&#13;
soil conservation techniques and invest in perennial crops and other attached investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
H.    Participation Approach&#13;
2.14   Participatory processes have and will continue to support project preparation and&#13;
implementation.   Three  seminars  (Land  Policy  Options, Registry  and  Cadastre&#13;
Experiences and Alternative Conflict Resolution Mechanisms) were held during&#13;
preparation with a wide range of Government and nongovermnent participants. Prior to&#13;
the pilot project field work, broad information campaigns and consultations with elected&#13;
Mayors were  conducted.   Such  consultations  will continue  throughout project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
3. PROJECT COST, FINANCING PLAN AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Project Cost&#13;
3.1    Total project cost is estimated at US$70 million. Project base cost is US$56&#13;
million (see Table 1 below). Physical contingencies are calculated on the basis of 10&#13;
percent for works, information campaigns, and operating costs, and 5 percent for&#13;
equipment and vehicles. Price contingencies are estimated as 8 percent for local costs (as&#13;
estimated by government) and 2.2 percent for foreign costs.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
B. Financing Plan&#13;
3.2   Total project cost is US$70 million. The proposed loan would provide US$50&#13;
million, including refinancing of the US$2 million PPF-264-ES, and the Government&#13;
would be responsible to provide the balance of US$20 million (see Table 2). Of the total&#13;
project cost, US$60.8 million would involve investment and US$9.2 million incremental&#13;
recurrent costs over six years. The proposed loan would fund US$4.2 million (about 46&#13;
percent) of incremental recurrent costs (salaries, operation, and maintenance costs) on a&#13;
declining basis: 100 percent up to the category withdrawals of US$2.0 million (estimated&#13;
by the end of 1999); thereafter, 75 percent up to the category of withdrawals of(US$ 3.0&#13;
million (estimated by the end of 2000); and 50 percent thereafter. The proposed loan&#13;
would finance about 67 percent of total local costs, a level warranted by El Salvador's&#13;
transition to peace, its financing commitments under the Peace Accords, and the&#13;
substantial share of project costs while implementing a program of fiscal austerity. To&#13;
ensure the maintenance of momentum achieved during project preparation, the PPF, and&#13;
pilot activities under PRISA, retroactive financing up to US$5 million (10 percent of&#13;
Bank loan) is recommended for eligible expenditures incurred after July 1995.&#13;

C. Financial Analysis&#13;
3.3   As part of the financial analysis of the land administration project, a cash-flow&#13;
analysis was prepared of the institutions involved in the project, whose budgets have now&#13;
been merged into the CNR's. During preparation, four scenarios were analyzed. The&#13;
scenarios varied in the assumptions governing the income-generating capacity of the&#13;
CNR, as well as the number of years required to complete the project. In all four&#13;
scenarios, net financing (including annual quotas for loan repayment) proved positive&#13;
throughout the period of analysis. This finding suggested that, even based on&#13;
conservative assumptions, the CNR should have sufficient liquidity to finance its&#13;
operations throughout the six years of the proposed Land Administration Project.&#13;
Additionally, the CNR should prove to be financially sustainable once the project ends in&#13;
the year 2002 (see Annex B5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
3.4   The key to the financial strength of the project lies in the revenue-generating&#13;
capacity of the CNR through its registry activities. Even prior to project start-up (i.e.,. in&#13;
1995), the annual revenues from combined RPRH, RSI, and IGN activities equaled an&#13;
estimated s55.3 million (US$6.3 million). Upon project completion (2002), annual CNR&#13;
revenues total 4l19.5 million in nominal terms, or US$8 million in constant 1995 dollars.&#13;
This 26 percent increase in the revenue-generating capacity of registry and cadastral&#13;
activities is generated by the registry services provided to new properties that will be&#13;
registered as a result of the process of the ampliaci6n (see para. 1.16), which occurs&#13;
regardless of and independently from the proposed project. However, the project will&#13;
provide the institutional development support allowing CNR to respond to this demand.&#13;
The additional revenue that is directly attributable to the project, measured by the&#13;
incremental revenue generated directly by the activities associated with the national land&#13;
regularization plan totals US$12.2 million between 1996-2003 and at least US$2.6&#13;
million each year thereafter.&#13;
Cost Minimization Analysis&#13;
3.5   No economic analysis of this project was carried out as a meaningful cost-benefit&#13;
analysis cannot be expected for this type of project. Instead, a cost minimization analysis&#13;
considered several aspects to ensure that the objectives of the project are achieved in the&#13;
most economic manner. The resulting cost of $40/ha for institutional development and&#13;
land regularization of the whole country compares very favorably with similar&#13;
experiences in the rest of the world. The key aspects considered focused on registry&#13;
investigation and analysis, and field verification (half of total project costs) (see Annex&#13;
E5).&#13;
4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENT AND&#13;
REPORTING&#13;
A. Implementing Agency&#13;
4.1   The project implementing agency would be the CNR. The CNR is decentralized&#13;
agency under the Ministry of Justice with administrative and financial autonomy. The&#13;
CNR's governing body is its Board, headed by the Minister of Justice and composed of&#13;
the Executive Director of the CNR, the Vice Ministers of Planning, Housing and Public&#13;
Works, and the Project Coordinator. The Board is expected to be expanded to include&#13;
the Vice Ministers of Economy and Finance. The CNR currently implements both the&#13;
barido and the Sonsonate records integration of the pilot project through its Executing&#13;
Unit (UE-Unidad Ejecutora). This set up, which has been successful during the pilot,&#13;
would continue under the proposed project; the CNR Directorate would implement the&#13;
institutional strengthening and decentralization component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
4.2   The UE is composed of an international manager who reports to the CNR&#13;
Executing Director through a National Coordinator appointed by the CNR Board. This&#13;
coordinator ensures day to day relations with the Government and private professional&#13;
associations. For current organization of EU, see Annex E4. Under the project, the UE&#13;
would be strengthened with a Quality Control team (see para. 2.9 and Annex El). The&#13;
Quality Control Team, composed at least two experts, will follow-up on the technical&#13;
quality of the works, and on coordination with the institutional component. The two&#13;
experts will assist in monitoring compliance of contractors with technical specifications&#13;
and timely completing of works. In addition the UE will be in charge of training of local&#13;
consultant staff to ensure staff in sufficient quantity and with proper training are brought&#13;
in for the timely completion of the activities. Hiring of the Quality Control Team would&#13;
take place on June 30, 1996 (see para.5.2 (d)).&#13;
4.3   The UE would carryout the public information functions of the project, namely&#13;
public dissemination campaigns, contact with the mayors, and coordination with other&#13;
agencies.&#13;
4.4    The UE would also supervise consultants. It is currently supervising a Dutch-&#13;
based international consortium  headed by KADASTRE.   KADASTRE  is the&#13;
international arm of the Dutch Legal Cadastre, a world leader in innovating and&#13;
regularizing land records. The consortium is carrying out all technical aspects of the&#13;
PRISA-financed pilot project, including aerial photography, mapping, land regularization&#13;
field and registry work, as well as providing technical assistance for the institutional and&#13;
legal framework requirement of the CNR, including setting up the land information&#13;
system and making recommendations on institutional organizational issues.&#13;
4.5   In the national program, and based on the larger volume of works, the contracts&#13;
would be organized differently than the pilot. For instance, in the pilot program the&#13;
international firm entered into local contracts for the legal work. This was justified given&#13;
the lack of managerial experience to implement similar complex and dovetailed activities&#13;
in El Salvador. In the national program, however, the aerophotogrammetry and mapping&#13;
would be tendered separately to international firms, which would work under the&#13;
supervision of the UE. Local consultants would take on surveying and amalgamation of&#13;
the parcel-based records. Updating the LIS (see para. 2.6(b)) would be handled by&#13;
international consultants, following on the development of the computer-based registry&#13;
procedures and establishing the LIS under the pilot project. The verification of integrated&#13;
cadastral and legal data would be carried out by CNR registrars. All international firms&#13;
would work under the UE, whose quality control team will be responsible for supervising&#13;
the collection of basic information, technical standards, reporting requirements and&#13;
coordination with other contractors.&#13;
4.6   The UE would also carry out project administration, procurement, disbursements,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) audits and other reporting. The CNR's UE would&#13;
continue to carry out project administration, procurement and disbursement procedures.&#13;
To streamline financial flows, the GOES would agree during negotiations to make&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
available to the project, from CNR revenues or otherwise, funds required according to a&#13;
yearly budgeting process. As a condition of effectiveness, the government will open a&#13;
counterpart funds local currency account (see para. 5.3(a)). The UE would implement&#13;
an agreed Management Information System (MIS) for performance, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation (see para. 4.18). The UE will also carry out regular audits (see para. 4.16),&#13;
and submit information to the Bank as required to carry out effective supervision. The&#13;
Bank has identified key junctures where technical supervision would be appropriate (see&#13;
Annex E2) and will schedule supervision missions with these milestones.&#13;
B. Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.7   The UE will schedule and coordinate with the CNR the legal steps required to&#13;
formalize regularization data. Under the proposed legislative framework, prior to starting&#13;
work on an area, the site would be classed as "cadastral area" by executive decree. On&#13;
completion of regularization (formally entering the data into the LIS), the area would be&#13;
classed as "cadastred area" by the same means, thereby making the new records official&#13;
and start enforcing the registration obligations. For the proposed project, the legal&#13;
framework for land registry and cadastre is being revised to streamline these procedures&#13;
(see para. 1.19).&#13;
4.8   Coverage will be sequenced, beginning with the Central and Western regions&#13;
(Phase 1), and then moving to the Northern and Eastern regions (Phase 2). This area&#13;
sequencing will balance the workload of the 115 field verification teams by combining the&#13;
smallest region (Western) with the largest (Central, which includes the San Salvador&#13;
metropolitan area).&#13;
4.9   During Phase 1, technical assistance will need to be more intense to anchor the&#13;
learning process, and because it includes the more difficult departments, such as&#13;
Chalatenango, which has Peace Accord tasks and only a partial cadastre. This phase will&#13;
also include San Salvador, because it is both strategically important to the program's&#13;
credibility to advance rapidly in a high-profile metropolitan area and also has the highest&#13;
revenue-generating potential due to its larger number of parcels and the velocity of their&#13;
turnover. The revenue generated in the first phase would be available to defray&#13;
counterpart costs of the project (see para. 2.12) for the second phase. A preliminary&#13;
timing of program activities is included in Annex B2.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
4.10  A procurement assessment, conducted by the Bank in 1992, concluded that there&#13;
are no major conflicts between local procurement procedures and Bank policies and&#13;
guidelines. In 1992 the government amended the procurement law to lift restrictions on&#13;
the participation of foreign companies in civil works. The CNR will carry out all&#13;
procurement under the proposed operation following the January 1995 Guidelines:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, with technical assistance from UNDP&#13;
under a cost-sharing agreement satisfactory to the Bank and similar to the one being&#13;
successfully implemented for the PRISA project. Under that cost-sharing agreement,&#13;
UNDP assists the government in procuring goods, works, and services financed by the&#13;
project-using standardized procurement documents satisfactory to the Bank. As a&#13;
condition of effectiveness the government would present evidence of having entered into&#13;
a similar mechanism for the proposed project (see para. 5.3 (b); for procurement plan,&#13;
see Annex E3).&#13;
4.11  Works and Service Contracts. The project would finance civil works and&#13;
service contracts. For small civil works to rehabilitate the San Salvador CNR offices and&#13;
the other regional and municipal offices, national competitive bidding (NCB) would be&#13;
used to the extent possible for procurement. However, since these works are widely&#13;
scattered, most minor works, estimated to cost less than US$350,000 per contract and&#13;
up to an aggregate amount of US$2 million, are expected to be procured under lump&#13;
sum fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of three quotations. For service&#13;
contracts, international competitive bidding (ICB) would be used, primarily for mapping&#13;
(aerial photography, stereo plotting preparation, and aerotriangulation) and restitution,&#13;
including complementary topographic surveys (about US$14.0 million), in packages&#13;
valued above US$1 million. Below this amount, service contracts would be awarded&#13;
through NCB, up to an aggregate amount of $1.0 million. For the information&#13;
campaign, direct contracting will be used for the with newspapers and radio stations, at&#13;
prices not higher than prevailing rates for comparable services, as well as for small&#13;
contracts for the distribution of leaflets and local announcements, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of $3.5 million.&#13;
4.12 Goods. Vehicle purchases would be packaged into contracts valued at more than&#13;
US$250,000 and procured through Limited International Bidding (LIB) from suppliers&#13;
with service and maintenance facilities in El Salvador and neighboring countries. Other&#13;
goods, including computers, office equipment and furniture, would be procured through&#13;
ICB. Packages of similar equipment valued between US$50,000 and $250,000, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$250,000, would be procured through national competitive&#13;
bidding (NCB). Miscellaneous equipment items valued under US$50,000, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$600,000, would be procured using national and international&#13;
shopping procedures.&#13;
4.13  Consultant Services. All consultant services will be procured according to the&#13;
guidelines, Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency (August, 1981). For prior review limits, see Table 4.&#13;
4.14 Review Requirements. Prior review by the Bank would be required for (a) all&#13;
contracts awarded through ICB and LIB, (b) the first two contracts for goods, works&#13;
and service contracts (if any) awarded under NCB, and (c) all contracts for consulting&#13;
services, with the exceptions noted in Table 3 below. All other contracts would be&#13;
subject to ex-post review by the Bank during supervision. These arrangements would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
ensure prior review by the Bank of about 85 percent of the value of all Bank-financed&#13;
contracts. All procurement documentation would be kept by the UE for periodic&#13;
supervision by Bank staff. Table 3 summarizes procurement arrangements by category&#13;
and Table 4 highlights the thresholds for each procurement method and for prior review.&#13;

D. Disbursement&#13;
4.15   Disbursements would occur over the project's six-year life. The loan closing date&#13;
would be six years after effectiveness, estimated to occur in June 1996. The borrower,&#13;
GOES, would establish a Special Account for the project in a commercial bank. under&#13;
conditions satisfactory to the Bank, in US currency, with an authorized allocation of US&#13;
$2.0 million and an initial deposit of US$0.5 million, equal to about four months of&#13;
estimated disbursements under the loan not covered under costs sharing agreement with&#13;
UNDP (see para. 4.10). Disbursement requests to the Bank would be made by the CNR&#13;
and processed by the UE. Disbursements against contracts for goods under US$250,000,&#13;
civil and mapping works under US$350,000, consultants firms under US$100,000 and&#13;
individuals  under  US$50,000;  information  campaign  and  incremental  recurrent&#13;
expenditures would be made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs).&#13;
Disbursements against all civil works, works and goods contracts above the set limits,&#13;
would be made against full documentation submitted to the Bank. As indicated in the&#13;
disbursement schedule (see Annex F), disbursement would be at the rate of 80 percent&#13;
for works, service contracts and information campaign, 60 percent for local consultant&#13;
services, 100 percent for intemational consultant services and training, 100 percent for&#13;
foreign costs for equipment and fumiture and 87 percent for local goods purchased&#13;
locally-in all cases excluding taxes and for eligible expenses only. The projected eight&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
year schedule of Bank disbursements (see Annex F) reflects the historical El Salvador&#13;
disbursement profile (for all sectors), which spans eight years; the profile was adjusted to&#13;
reflect the best estimate of expected Bank disbursements. To ensure a smooth transition&#13;
from activities programmed under the proposed project and the ongoing PRISA-funded&#13;
pilot project, retroactive financing of up to US$5.0 million is recommended for&#13;
expenditures incurred after July 1, 1995.&#13;
E. Accounts and Auditing&#13;
4.16    The CNR would maintain separate central project accounts, including&#13;
consolidation of accounts from regional offices. Each of its four regional offices would&#13;
also maintain separate project accounts for project expenditures incurred by them. All&#13;
accounts would adequately reflect project expenditures made in accordance with sound&#13;
accounting practices. Financial documents (procurement, disbursement requests, budgets&#13;
audit reports) would be reviewed by the UE before submission to the Bank. A certified&#13;
copy of the project audit by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and in&#13;
accordance with the Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects&#13;
Financed by the World Bank (March, 1982), would be submitted to the Bank not more&#13;
than six months after the completion of each financial year. The audit report would&#13;
include a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements against certified Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs) and the Special Account. SOEs would be made available to the&#13;
Bank and reviewed by supervision missions. The implementing agency has a clear&#13;
understanding of the scope and format of project financial reports required by the Bank,&#13;
which they have been complying satisfactorily under the PRISA project.&#13;
F. Project Reporting, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.17 Reporting, monitoring and evaluation would be the responsibility of CNR. The&#13;
project would be managed by the UE under the CNR (see para. 4.1). Project&#13;
management would be backstopped by a management information system (MIS),&#13;
described below to carry out the project M&amp;E to enable the CNR timely follow-up of&#13;
implementation.&#13;
4.18 The main vehicle for M&amp;E would be quarterly reports prepared by the EU for the&#13;
CNR Board and Bank supervision. M&amp;E indicators are part of the MIS system. The&#13;
UE would complete the MIS design, which would include periodic reports on impact,&#13;
and quarterly reports on financial, implementation, and legal indicators of project&#13;
progress (based on indicators in Annexes G1-4). The main features of this system are the&#13;
monitoring of activities in reference to the objectives of the project, namely land security&#13;
and institutional development. These impact indicators refer to the improvements in land&#13;
security as measured by the number of regularized parcels and credit granted to newly&#13;
registered parcels. The financial indicators would monitor the financial health of the CNR&#13;
as well as the counterpart funds availability for the project as per yearly budgeting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
process (see para. 4.6). Progress would be monitored through the implementation&#13;
indicators would monitor progress on updating legal and cadastral information; number&#13;
of parcels regularized; the legal evolution of the CNR; training; and technical assistance.&#13;
Legal indicators would monitor compliance with legal covenants. Formats were agreed&#13;
during negotiations (see para. 5.2(b)) First quarterly report would be due July 1996.&#13;
Terms of reference for establishing baselines are in Annex G5.&#13;
G. Supervision by the Bank&#13;
4.19  Intense supervision would be required during the first phase because of the&#13;
breadth of the proposed project and the difficulty involved in a massive deployment of&#13;
field teams. A supervision plan has been prepared, identifying key junctures where&#13;
supervision would be appropriate (see Annex E2). Major tools for supervision would be:&#13;
(a) quarterly reports with M&amp;E information generated by the MIS (see para. 4.18 and&#13;
Annex G), including impact, financial, implementation, and legal indicators; (b) periodic&#13;
independent studi.i and (c) a midterm review.&#13;
(a)   Periodic Independent Studies. During negotiations, assurances are to be&#13;
obtained that the Government would carry out periodic independent&#13;
studies to review aspects of implementation and modernization. The first&#13;
such study would be a review of tariffs to reconfirm self-financing and&#13;
indicator baseline survey (see TORs in Annex B6 and G5). Other such&#13;
studies would be on the effectiveness of the new CNR, project impact&#13;
surveys, evaluation of administrative decentralization on role of&#13;
municipalities, prospective property valuation system, property rights and&#13;
farm productivity and others to be agreed with the Bank.&#13;
(b)   Midterm Review. During negotiations, assurances are to be obtained that&#13;
the government would hold a midterm review no later than November 30,&#13;
1998. In addition to the points normally covered in annual reviews, the&#13;
review would analyze the need to restructure or redesign any aspect of&#13;
the project and the financial health of the CNR. It would also look at the&#13;
need to modify the following year's work plan, if necessary, to achieve&#13;
project objectives more efficiently.&#13;
H. Expected Benefits and Risks&#13;
4.20  Project Benefits. The project would enhance land security-and value-and&#13;
contribute to better land use and enhanced collateral. Secure property rights achieved&#13;
through a process of field adjudication and non judicial conflict resolution are an&#13;
important contributor to peace and a significant step toward creating a fluid land market.&#13;
Also, because land is a store of value, land holders not currently regularized (mostly&#13;
rural and poor) who obtain registered titles under the project will be able to save in land&#13;
and convey to others their interest in land assets at the full market value. Finally, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
establishment of a consolidated and self-financing CNR consolidating land registry and&#13;
cadastre functions, able to maintain records updated, is the condition for project&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
4.21   An economic analysis of this project was not carried out because a meaningful&#13;
cost/benefit analysis cannot be expected from this type of project. A description of major&#13;
technical choices involved in the design of the land data acquisition component (half of&#13;
the project costs) is in Annex E5 (see also para. 3.5).&#13;
4.22   Risks. The main risk lies in the difficulty of strengthening the CNR to modernize&#13;
the tasks of constituent agencies, RPRH/RSI and IGN. The difficulty stems from two&#13;
aspects, financial resources and human resources. Financial resources are expected to be&#13;
sufficient because historically, fees generated by RPRH have generated revenues for the&#13;
Treasury and new CNR financial autonomy allows it retain all of its revenues. In&#13;
addition, land regularization and universal registration effectively double its clientbase.&#13;
Technical staff are not sufficient but CNR will upgrade it by retrenching unnecessary&#13;
(mainly support or outdated) staff and hiring more technically qualified staff at higher&#13;
salaries with the salary savings. Legislative Decree No. 471 allowing civil service&#13;
retrenchment with enhanced indemnizations was approved on October 12, 1995, and&#13;
CNR shed 350 positions in December 1995. Administrative unrest is not expected after&#13;
these separations are completed. Some of the retrenched staff will be contracted by the&#13;
project for specific, temporary tasks.&#13;
4.23   A secondary risk is that the magnitude of the demand for field teams (115)&#13;
required under the project exceeds the available local capacity. An intensive training&#13;
program has been designed to train staff and contractors and the government has agreed&#13;
to hire the Quality Control Team before June 30, 1996. (see para. 5.2 (d)).&#13;
4.24   Civil unrest is not a risk.  Aided by a growing economy and substantial&#13;
remittances, the peace process has been relatively successful. Crime-related insecurity&#13;
remains, however, and being addressed by the recently installed civil police.&#13;

EL SALVADOR&#13;
LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE NATIONAL REGISTRY CENTER&#13;
1.    This annex describes the current institutional setup of the National Registry Center&#13;
(CNR), including its history, current status, size, functions, and organization. Annex B&#13;
describes the activities envisaged under the project to strengthen and decentralize the CNR.&#13;
Current Institutional Setup&#13;
2.    National Registry Center. The Government of El Salvador (GOES) created CNR by&#13;
Executive Decree no. 62 of December 7, 1994. More recently, CNR was established as an&#13;
autonomous agency by Legislative Decree No. 462, approved October 5, 1995. With this act,&#13;
GOES was able to combine the lines of authority and take the first step to streamline procedures&#13;
and establish a consolidated land registry and cadastral system. This consolidation builds on the&#13;
success of the Social Land Registry (RSI) in rationalizing and automating procedures for the&#13;
registration of land in marginal areas, mainly in San Salvador. By integrating the functions of RSI&#13;
with those of the Land and Mortgage Registry (RPRH) and the National Geographic Institute&#13;
(IGN), the GOES laid the foundation for creating an efficient, streamlined and financially self-&#13;
sustaining national cadastre and land-registration mechanism&#13;
3.    CNR is overseen by a Board composed of the Minister of Justice (chair); the vice&#13;
ministers of the Housing and Urban Development, Planing and Public Works; and the head of&#13;
the National Family Secretariat (currently the First Lady of the Republic and a notary by training).&#13;
Directly under the council, and reporting to it, is an executive director. The director of registries&#13;
(land and commerce) and the executive director of the IGN report to the executive director of the&#13;
CNR. (See Annexes Al, A2 and A3.)&#13;
4.    Land and Mortgage Registry. The Registro de la Propriedad Real e Hipotecas&#13;
(RPRH)-4and and mortgage registry system-draws on the principles of the nineteenth century&#13;
Napoleonic Civil Code prevalent in most countries in Latin America. The Napoleonic deed&#13;
registry is grantee-based rather than land-based (folio personal rather than folio reat.' RPRH&#13;
has ten departmental offices. The RPRH operates as a public registry. Consequently, the public&#13;
can access all inforrnation in the registry.&#13;
1.   Except San Salvador, which uses thefolio real system&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex A&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
5.    The present land registration system is bureaucratic and leads to delays. Notaries are not&#13;
obliged to register, procedures for insciption are discretionary with no standardized deed fornat&#13;
requiements and supporting document reqirements cumbersome. Therefore, the San Salvador&#13;
registry-the main one in the country-has a backlog of 8 to 10 years, mainly in problem&#13;
documents (staled registrations) requiring supplementary documentation, court orders, and the&#13;
like. Registration is not obligatory, and despite the legal security it provides, the incentives were&#13;
stacked against registering land. Hence, RPRH cannot cope efficiently with increasing&#13;
demand for diversified services, including land distribution programs, new settlements, and&#13;
urban sprawl. A current review of registry and cadastral legislation aims at establishing new&#13;
rules to expedite processing of problem cases.&#13;
6.    RPRfIs procedures for inscription are discretionary, lack transparency and are&#13;
inefficient. This system gives registrars excessive autonomy in decisions to reject or delay&#13;
certain registration applications. The registrar can stop the process because of a superficial&#13;
mistake or oversight (i.e.,spelling/typing error, lack of second surname). Because RPRH&#13;
also lacks the resources to acquire modern office technology and computer software, all&#13;
registration operations are manual.&#13;
7.    Supporting documentation required for registration often does not relate to the&#13;
transaction taking place, often stalling the process for extraneous reasons. In the past,&#13;
procedures were also hampered because RPRH had to verify payment of wealth and estate taxes.&#13;
The abolition of the wealth and estate taxes has emminated these barriers, but the land registry&#13;
must still collect evidence of payment of the less onerous municipal taxes and personal transit&#13;
roads fee (vialidad clase  'C');2 these certificates can be lost, and when they are, the&#13;
process is stopped until new copies can be obtained. The Ministry of Finance does not allow&#13;
repayment if taxes have already been paid, and copies of old records take a very long time to&#13;
obtain (due to backlogs at the Corte de Cuentas (Controllers), there are cases of eight-year&#13;
waits).&#13;
2 Draft legislation is now before the Legislature to abolish these requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex A&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
8.    Other bottlenecks stemming from the current registration system are the low level of&#13;
registry services (not enough registrars), a document presentation system that does not&#13;
guarantee priority (first to register is recognized as having legitimate right, but priority can&#13;
be abused or ignored)-therefore preventive annotations on the registry volumes are not&#13;
sufficient to guarantee rightful ownership security. Also, because some deeds are ancient,&#13;
the literal description of the property in the deeds does not coincide with described&#13;
boundaries and the property's actual area and location. Furthermore, the neighbors may&#13;
have changed and there is no recollection of true area or boundaries. This operation is&#13;
aggravated by the lack of a single national identification document, although lately GOES&#13;
has expanding the use of the taxpayer number or NIT (numero de identificaci6n tributaria).&#13;
9.    Examples of current problems in the legal procedures are the following:&#13;
*  Properties without prior registration, because no cadastre exists in the area, or&#13;
without updated information.&#13;
*  Broken successive tract because an inheritance was not registered, thus the&#13;
grandchildren cannot register their right inherited from the registered&#13;
grandparent.&#13;
*  Deeds not registered, even if legitimattely established because notaries are not&#13;
now obliged to present deeds to the registry.&#13;
*  Adverse possession laws: require 30 years of occupancy before a title of adverse&#13;
possession (titulo supletorio) can be granted.&#13;
*  De facto collective property (Proindivisos de facto) successively parceled and&#13;
not registered.&#13;
*  Leases with purchase options. Such an agreement is not a 'teal" right, and it&#13;
cannot be registered at the present time. But this practice is a common means of&#13;
purchasing property for small urban developments, in the absence of access to a&#13;
long-term mortgage market. An estimated 350,000 families currently in this&#13;
situation are at risk of developer fraud.&#13;
10.   RPRH's legal and institutional inadequacy became a critical issue, given the need to&#13;
fonnalize rights in squatter settlements that resulted from civil war and urban in-migration. For&#13;
instance, there is no back-up documentation. Only the San Salvador registry established a&#13;
microfiche backup, located in the same building as the original documents; If a fire or an act of&#13;
God occurs, both copies could be destroyed. During the civil war, the FMLN destroyed land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex A&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
records in some conflict areas. This inforrnation would be restored under the proposed project.&#13;
The proposed project includes decentralized back-up systems for the four offices.&#13;
11.    Staffing. RPHR has about 300 staft of which too many are support staff and not&#13;
enough are technical and managerial staff The consolidation of the CNR requires support&#13;
training to adapt RPRH/RSI and IGN staff skills to the new integrated legal and cadastral records&#13;
and to the computerized management of land information. More registrars skilled on automated&#13;
procedures will be required to move on to the successful RSI system (see para. 12).&#13;
12.    The Social Land Registry. Because RPRH was not able to handle large-scale land&#13;
registration, such as the kind needed in marginal areas, GOES decided in 1991 to bypass RPRH&#13;
and create RSI. After four years in operation RSI already shows promising results, and it is more&#13;
agile and efficient than RPRH. On average it takes RSI three days to clear and register a title and&#13;
integrate title registration with cadastre information-it is computerizing all cadastre data in its&#13;
areas of operation-and its computerized title inscriptions permit easy searches and data retrieval.&#13;
Because of its innovative procedures, RSI's inscription volume is already 40 percent that of&#13;
RPRH, even though it also records cadastre data, has only a third of RPRH's staff and operates in&#13;
only two locations.&#13;
13.    The original establishment of the RSI was supported by AID in 1986, with the technical&#13;
assistance of the Peruvian Instituto Libertady Democracia (ILD). The ILD pioneered the 'tocial&#13;
registry' concept to register marginal lands in Lima, Peru, and to circumvent legal bottlenecks&#13;
that had precluded titling before it created the Registro Predial, managed by ILD, an NGO. The&#13;
RSI is a similar concept, with the Instituto Libertady Progreso (ILP) performing a similar role&#13;
as the Peruvian ILD. The contentious issues related to the Registro Predal have been the&#13;
potential for moral hazard created by (a) the 'Witness verification" of adverse possession claims,&#13;
(b) the parallel nature of the Registro Predial, because it had no links with the traditional registry,&#13;
and (c) the lack of properly georeferenced cadastral information that the Registro Predial&#13;
attaches to itsfolio reales (because this information is not available). The RSI has remedied these&#13;
issues by restricting its regularization to preventive annotations when the claims are not frilly&#13;
supported (instead of fill registration) and by subordinating the RSI to the traditional registry as a&#13;
branch for specified clients (social interest properties so designated by ILP), including cadastral&#13;
data to its parcel records, the latter will be properly georeferenced when cadastral information is&#13;
updated under the proposed project. The RSI assesses that, although the ILD concepts were&#13;
useful, less than 5 percent of the original ILD design is left. The proposed project also addresses&#13;
issues not included in the Registro Predial model (i.e., conflict resolution mechanisms, service&#13;
and revenue diversification).&#13;
14.   RSI will provide some key institutional elements for CNR's future land registry&#13;
operations. RSI operates as an autonomous agency under RPRH. It has a defined mandate, to&#13;
register titles in squatter settlements and handle large-scale title registrations for, inter alia,&#13;

FONAVIPO, the social housing fund. RSI's purview has recently been expanded to register plots&#13;
distributed under the Peace Accords and the ampliaci6n, i.e., all transactions requiring boundary&#13;
changes are registered by RSL, housing developments and parcel fragmentation. Recent addition&#13;
to RSI's portfolio raised demand for RSI services some 40 percent, particularly from institutions&#13;
financing housing developments. Another key element to RSI's success is that it is allowed to&#13;
retain its fee revenues to buy equipment and hire higher-paid staff without outside ex arde&#13;
clearance. RSI has a 'bne-stop window'receiving both legal and cadastral information. Because&#13;
RSI can also control its work flow and set priorities among potential clients, it does not have a&#13;
backlog. This substantially reduces document losses. These operating procedures will be&#13;
incorporated under the proposed project; registration priority will be assigned before accepting&#13;
registration requests and supporting documentation will be scanned.&#13;
15.   The National Geographic Institute (IGN). The cadastre lies with IGN, which is also in&#13;
charge of national cartography. IGN operates under the terms of the national cadastre law. One&#13;
of its roles is to complement land registries with cadastral dates to ensure the accuracy of land&#13;
records.&#13;
16.   IGN's budget has been insufficient to finance its operation. More than 90 percent of the&#13;
budget is slated for salaries. Available equipment is outdated and/or out of order, including an&#13;
airplane in disrepair and with no global positioning system (GPS) mounted on it. Only one or two&#13;
cadastral teams will be needed in the new CNR configuration, where all cadastral updating work&#13;
will be the responsibility of the land owners. CNR cadastral teams will only issue guidelines on&#13;
how the work will need to be presenter to ensure trouble-free inclusion in to the new folio real&#13;
system and its automated land information system (LIS).&#13;
17.   Because current legislation relating to land registries establishes no technical-legal&#13;
corrllements between those registries and cadastral data, updating the latter has suffered from&#13;
exccssive delays. Consequently, there has been a breakdown in the functional relationship&#13;
between the cadastre and the registry, these problems have often resulted in confusion as&#13;
cadastral data are not always available to support land registration procedures. Only about 40&#13;
percent of El Salvador's properties are registered, and of those tracts, less than a third have&#13;
cadastral references. NMany properties with valid registrations cannot be located. Cadastral&#13;
information sent by the land and social registries to IGN are not systematically updated.&#13;
During the appraisal mission (July 1995), an IGN official categorized as 'yesterday's" the&#13;
cadastral backlog dating back to 1992. A key activity of the project will be to overcome&#13;
problems resulting from this lack of coordination.&#13;
Other Institutions Involved in Registration and Cadastral Procedures&#13;
18.   Complementing the functions of the various public-sector agencies described above are&#13;
notaries, topographers, and municipal offices. Notaries are private-sector specialized lawyers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

whose role is to intermediate and provide legally binding effect to all acts and transacdons&#13;
affecting real property, such as sales, mortgages, leases, conveyance by inheritance. There is no&#13;
'hotaries monopoly"( i.e., there is free entry for all lawyers into the notary profession by passing&#13;
an exam). Notanes' fees are regulated, but because of the abundance of notaries, these fees are&#13;
ceilings and rarely attained. A major flaw of the present system is that notaries have no legal&#13;
obligation to register titles or any of the transactions affecting properties. This weakness has&#13;
added to the conusion of the present system. Only registration at the land or social registries&#13;
makes the registration information public, with universal access, and provides good faith to the&#13;
transactions.&#13;
19.    Topography is an unchartered profession in El Salvador. There is no guild, no quality&#13;
control, no licensing. Most technicians worldng as topographers are civil engineers (or related&#13;
profession) or are technicians graduated from technical schools, notably the IDB-supported&#13;
Instituto Tecnolgico Centoamerino (ITCA).&#13;
20.    Municipal offices can grant title to municipal lands, but these titles, if not registered into&#13;
the land registry, arc inot legally binding before third parties.&#13;

EL SALVADOR&#13;
LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING AND DECENTRALIZATION COMPONENT&#13;
1.    This annex describes the activities and implementation process of the institutional&#13;
decentralization and strengthening component of the proposed project. This component&#13;
will finance the establishment of the institutional framework, structure and procedures for&#13;
the introduction of an integrated, nationwide mapping and land registration system.' The&#13;
objective is to achieve institutional capacity to maintain records up to date after&#13;
regularization takes place.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.    El Salvador's land registry and cadastral system's legal and institutional&#13;
inadequacy is creating serious problems at a time when the Government of El Salvador&#13;
(GOES) is trying to formalize property rights. Of particular concern for the project are&#13;
squatter settlements (usually the result of the civil war and migration from poor rural&#13;
areas) and land transfers as part of the Peace Accords.&#13;
3.    To move from the present, archaic, and inefficient system to one that is both&#13;
efficient and financially self-sustaining, it will be necessary to consolidate, restructure, and&#13;
streamline the agencies that implement the current system-RPRH, RSI, and IGN. The&#13;
end result will be an integrated "universal register," managed by the National Registry&#13;
Center (Centro Nacional de Regis&amp;ros-CNR; see Annex A). CNR's legal status is that of&#13;
an autonomous agency under the purview of the Ministry of Justice. To achieve maximum&#13;
efficiency in land-registration and cadastral procedures, CNR's activities will be&#13;
decentralized to regional and municipal levels. Establishing the new registry system will&#13;
also involve other agencies (such as the commerce registry, which falls under the purview&#13;
of the CNR but not under the proposed project).2&#13;
Actions Required for Institutional Consolidation&#13;
4.    With help from the Bank and a team of international consultants-KADASTER&#13;
BV-CNR has prepared a detailed institutional development plan. It describes the actions&#13;
1. The history and organization of El Salvador's current land-registration and cadastre system are&#13;
described in Annex A.&#13;
2. The Bank-proposed Competitiveness Enhancement Technical Assistance Project (Loan 3946-ES) is&#13;
supporting institutional development activities for the commerce registry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
(and stages) that will be required for CNR to evolve into a single institution, including the&#13;
merger of RPRH, RSI, and IGN. The development plan includes&#13;
(a)   a plan of action to be carried out to achieve the consolidation of RPRH,&#13;
RSI, and IGN into CNR (see below) and Annex BI;&#13;
(b)   a timetable for implementation (see Annex B2); and&#13;
(c)   a training plan (see Annex B3).&#13;
Institutional Aspects and Regional Decentralization&#13;
5.    The main functions of CNR are defined in Executive Decree No. 62 dated&#13;
December 7, 1994 and ratified by Legislative Decree No. 462, approved on October 5,&#13;
1995. Approved legislation states CNR's administrative and financial autonomy, role and&#13;
detailed functions and technical aspects and identifies the services and products to be&#13;
provided as well as the functions of each of its component. Approval of this decree is a&#13;
condition of negotiations. To carry out this consolidation and other aspects of the project,&#13;
CNR is working in close cooperation with KADASTER's consultants who will be in El&#13;
Salvador for as long as two years under the PRISA- (Loan 3576-ES) financed pilot&#13;
project.&#13;
6.    After the existing agencies have been restructured under a single umbrella (CNR),&#13;
the next step is to select staff for CNR's new role and functions. Legislative Decree No.&#13;
471, approved on October 12, 1995, provides authority and resources for public agencies&#13;
to retrench redundant staff. The following phase of implementation (January 1996-June&#13;
1996) will be the transition phase after retrenchment, when training or remaining staff and&#13;
new hires will start (see Annex B3, Training Plan).&#13;
7.    The final phase of implementation will start in late 1996 and involve decentralizing&#13;
CNR's functions into one central office and three regional offices, respectively: San&#13;
Salvador's metropolitan area and Santa Ana/Sonsonate, San Vicente, and San Miguel. As&#13;
soon as each of the four new offices has introduced the unified, computerized land registry&#13;
and cadastre system, operations will be further decentralized to 52 municipal offices.&#13;
8.    The functions of each municipal office will be dual. First, each will be equipped&#13;
with "read only" data retrieval systems to service local clients by informing them of the&#13;
status of registration and cadastration. Second, each municipal office will act as a&#13;
collecting point of data on new transactions affecting properties within their respective&#13;
catchment areas. Each office will transmit this information to their regional office for&#13;
processing.&#13;
9.    The reason CNR's functions will be decentralized only after completing the&#13;
consolidation of existing agencies is twofold. First, full consolidation under CNR will&#13;
integrate working procedures and establish a central management structure. Without this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
framework, it will not be possible to introduce the new system of folio real registration on&#13;
a phased basis. The new integrated computerized registry and cadastre systems will be&#13;
brought on line sequentially in the four regions after data from aerial photography and on-&#13;
site verifications have been reconciled and digitalized. This phasing procedure, in turn, will&#13;
make the institutional development process easier to implement because each regional&#13;
office will be able to learn from the experience of others.&#13;
10.   The project execution unit for the pilot project in Sonsonate will work with the&#13;
executive committee of CNR to develop organizational charts, work-flow charts, and job&#13;
descriptions for the new CNR system. This task will include defining the respective&#13;
responsibilities of the management council (Consejo de Direcci6n-CD) and executive&#13;
director (Director Ejecutivo-DE). The following functions are anticipated:&#13;
*  Acting under the authority of the Minister of Justice, the CD will determine&#13;
CNR's general orientation, business policies, operating procedures, and budget.&#13;
The CD will also appoint CNR's senior managers.&#13;
- Acting under the authority of the CD, the DE will be responsible for&#13;
subcontracting of services, determining personnel policies and internal&#13;
regulations, and representing CNR at its official functions. DE will also set&#13;
CNR's annual business plans and be responsible for delegations of authority to&#13;
CNR's component bodies. Acting under the DE are the director of registries&#13;
(land and commerce) and the executive director of the IGN.&#13;
Operational Aspects of Functional Decentralization&#13;
11.   Under the decentralization, functions under the new structure would be as follows:&#13;
(a)   Central Level Functions. A first tier, the central-level functions to be&#13;
provided by CNR will be managerial and administrative. These tasks will&#13;
include, among other things, the general orientation, planning,&#13;
programming and budgeting, financial management and accounting, human&#13;
resource management, relations with other organizations, and follow-up of&#13;
operations.&#13;
(b)   Technical Functions.These duties to be provided at the central level by&#13;
CNR will include&#13;
*  maintaining relationships with related professions;&#13;
*  elaborating technical instructions and legal, topographic, and system&#13;
norms;&#13;
*  elaborating terms of reference for contractors (firms) and receiving and&#13;
controlling the quality of their works and services;&#13;
*  elaborating model documents for procedures for document updating,&#13;
certifications, and topographic surveys;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
*  carrying  out technical works of national interest: technology&#13;
development, geodesic surveys, general topography;&#13;
*  improving legal procedures, technical and systems works;&#13;
*  training; and&#13;
*  safeguarding the national land registry and cadastre documentation.&#13;
(c)   Regional Level Functions. A key regional responsibility will be to update&#13;
the national land registry and cadastre. Also, CNR's regional offices will&#13;
ensure personnel management of human resources and other resources of&#13;
the regional center. Regional offices will also provide technical support by&#13;
*  issuing cadastral extracts for preparing deeds and other documents,&#13;
including modifications of real rights;&#13;
*  issuing legal information for the preparation of deeds and other&#13;
documents; issuing summaries of registry information;&#13;
v  accepting documents, including registration and modification of real&#13;
rights; maintaining legal control of documentation and cadastral&#13;
surveys;&#13;
*  employing automated updating of the national land registry and&#13;
cadastre; and&#13;
*  carrying out requested technical works (e.g., topographic surveys).&#13;
(d)   Municipal Level Functions. The responsibilities of the municipalities in the&#13;
new organizational setup will be twofold. They will consist first, in&#13;
informing the registry of any real right transactions and second, in&#13;
providing information to users on the land registry and cadastre&#13;
information. This will be provided either visually or by issuing a summary&#13;
or a copy of records. Records provided by municipalities will be&#13;
standardized nationwide and will, in each case, be adapted to the needs of&#13;
the party requesting the information. By definition, notaries and registrars&#13;
will primarily carry out their functions at the municipal level, in&#13;
coordination with regional offices. In each case, the latter will verify&#13;
documents issued by these professionals. Other traditional municipal&#13;
functions-statistics, marriage licenses, birth and marriage certificates-&#13;
will remain unchanged.&#13;
Operating Procedures and Manuals&#13;
12.   CNR is in the process of elaborating operating procedures for the central and&#13;
regional levels, as well as for operations at the municipal levels. These procedures will&#13;
include definitions and guidelines to be set out. The procedures will cover such areas as&#13;
(a) accounting plan, contracting, budget and controls; (b) territorial organization and&#13;
functions as per para. 11.); (c) relations with municipal officers and reporting guidelines&#13;
for such officers to CNR's regional offices; and (d) relations with other public sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
agencies, the private sector, NGOs, professional associations, and academic institutions. Ir.&#13;
this context, CNR has already established formal contacts with universities and local&#13;
lawyer and notary associations to inform them of the new structure taking shape in land&#13;
registration and cadastre services.&#13;
Personnel Management, Planning, and Training&#13;
13.   CNR has prepared a complete inventory of the physical assets (plant, equipment,&#13;
and databases) of each agency to be absorbed. It is also mapping future requirements for&#13;
personnel and skills against current staff. Working with the international team of cadastre&#13;
consultants and the project coordinating unit, CNR is preparing a list of physical&#13;
requirements (office space, vehicles, computer hardware and software, GPS). In both&#13;
cases, CNR is taking both a short-term and medium-term (six-year) horizon.&#13;
14.   Personnel policies will include modalities for hiring, training and contracting out.&#13;
15.   For training, CNR's organizational chart provides for an in-house training center.&#13;
Establishment of the training center is under way. The center will train its own instructors&#13;
in new computer and GPS techniques that will be the basis for CNR's future work.&#13;
Thereafter, the training center will prepare training curricula and courses for the CNR's&#13;
key required skills. The objective of all training programs will be to (a) prepare existing&#13;
staff for the changeover; (b) familiarize staff with new technologies and reporting&#13;
guidelines; and (c) ensure that managerial and technical competence will be adapted to the&#13;
planning and implementation of the proposed project. Where necessary, training will be&#13;
outsourced to universities or technical training centers. The Pilot project-provided&#13;
training has already trained six key management and technical staff at the offices of&#13;
KADASTER in Holland (see Training Plan in Annex B3). The national project will&#13;
expand training to cover needs of regional and municipal offices.&#13;
External Relations and Relations with Notaries&#13;
16.   All contacts with outside agencies and associations will be governed by rules of&#13;
confidentiality. Operating procedures will also determine the documents and information&#13;
to be provided by notaries in registration procedures, as well as formats and guidelines for&#13;
submissions and authentications of all relevant documents for land transactions in&#13;
regularized areas.&#13;
17.   Timely and open relations with notaries will be essential to the success of the&#13;
proposed reform of land registration. Notaries are a key element in that system. They are&#13;
private agents who prepare basic land-titling and other property-related documents, and&#13;
only they can authenticate the legal validity of documents submitted to CNR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
Settlement of Disputes&#13;
18.   A massive, nationwide reform of the land registration and cadastre system will&#13;
inevitably raise legal disputes over title, boundaries, and other aspects. To that effect,&#13;
CNR will carry out an information campaign and training on dispute settlement and&#13;
mediation procedures. In all instances the priority will be for mediation, rather than&#13;
resorting to courts of law.&#13;
Readiness of the Institutional Development Component&#13;
19.   Though no serious problems are expected in implementing this component, in the&#13;
initial phase, there could be some resistance from certain vested interests. The reasons for&#13;
such resistance are discussed in this section.&#13;
20.   Implementing this component will require consolidating the activities of three&#13;
existing agencies; one of them, IGN was, up to December 19194, part of another ministry,&#13;
the Ministry of Public Works. Experience with civil-service reform in other countries&#13;
shows that restructuring ministries and shifting operating agencies between ministries can&#13;
present logistical and labor problems, affect staff morale, and result in slower or poorer&#13;
quality output. A second source of resistance may come from RSI itself, as its employees&#13;
may fear that they will loose some of their autonomy, privileges, and pride of place by&#13;
being absorbed into a larger system.&#13;
21.   The initial consolidation phase will raise the delicate question of retrenching&#13;
redundant staff, which is underway.&#13;
22.   The second phase of decentralization involves regrouping the existing office of&#13;
IGN (11) and RPRH (10) and RSI (3) under four regional offices. The change will&#13;
inevitably involve relocating staff (which can be disruptive for families and may meet with&#13;
housing shortages in certain localities. This possibility could create labor unrest and will, in&#13;
any case, meet with opposition from trade unions.&#13;
23.   More generally, regrouping and blending staff from various preexisting units, as&#13;
weli as the rapid introduction of new computerized recording techniques and systems, will&#13;
raise the problems of further redundant functions, skill obsolescence, and skill&#13;
requirements. These problems would be mitigated by intensive training (see Annex B3)&#13;
and the flexibility to extend contracts to groups of qualified retrenched staff for fieldwork.&#13;
24.   Squatters and slum dwellers may misinterpret sight visits from field teams from the&#13;
Ministry of Justice-to verify cadastral information-and deny access to their property.&#13;
The experience proved the opposite during the experimental phase, where people&#13;
voluntarily presented their documents to the field staff and submitted to mediation&#13;
procedures before the project notary and if necessary, to the local Justice of the Peace,&#13;
free of charge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
25.   A final source of resistance may come from notaries who, until now, have not been&#13;
obliged under law to register titles. One the one hand, legislation approved by the National&#13;
Assembly on January 25, 1996 will oblige them to do so, thus imposing greater quality&#13;
control and responsibility on them. The commission hired to review the legislation is&#13;
composed of El Salvador's most respected notaries in registration issues, and their stamp&#13;
of approval is expected to smooth acceptance of changes. On the other hand, the process&#13;
will be streamlined and notaries' work will be facilitated after regularization.&#13;
26.   It is unlikely that any of the problems listed above would have a significant or&#13;
lasting impact on the project's implementation. First, a detailed action plan and timetable&#13;
(see Annex B I and B2) already exist. Second, the new integrated system should be able to&#13;
prove itself through efficiency gains, greater reliability (no risk of loss of documents, easy&#13;
data retrieval and updating) and, hopefully, greater access to formal credit for smallholders&#13;
whose titles have been regularized and registered.&#13;
27.   One way of reducing initial opposition to the new system will be to mount a&#13;
national advertising campaign to show the success of the Sonsonate pilot project and the&#13;
early phases of this component. This has been contemplated in project design.&#13;

LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
TRAINING PLAN&#13;
1.    The creation of CNR leads to an sole function for cadastral registry, replacing&#13;
three separate institutions. This requires provision of general information to all personnel&#13;
and also bringing those with new positions up to the required professional level. The&#13;
training project must include these different objectives. The training will be related to&#13;
different competency levels and at different stages of the project. It will be performed&#13;
essentially by the country's own resources. Some training will be provided abroad for&#13;
highly specialized equipment and methods. Specialized training will be into or&#13;
specialization in information technology. Individuals external from CNR (notaries,&#13;
lawyers) who will work for the project will receive also special training.&#13;
2.    The preparation of programs, search for instructors and conducting and evaluation&#13;
the training require recruitment of a specialized training coordinator by early 1996.&#13;
3.    The national project must start the training program as of the second half of 1996. The&#13;
purpose of this program is to:&#13;
(a)   prepare the staff for the technical changes; and&#13;
(b)   enable performance of the project activities in accordance with a schedule that&#13;
is compatible with the programming of the project, which will require rapid&#13;
mobilization of necessary resources.&#13;
4.    The following training plan comprises six items, for CNR  staff and private&#13;
professionals. The table at the end of this section summarizes estimated training costs for this&#13;
items.&#13;
Institutional Information and General Familiarization&#13;
5.    Objective. The autonomy and consolidation of the CNR  is designed to establish&#13;
one single function that will take the place of those performed to date by three separate&#13;
institutions. The establishment of this new center entails introduction of new working&#13;
methods and adoption of a new attitude.  This new  situation means that general&#13;
information must be made available to all CNR personnel on the functions of the&#13;
establishment, the purpose of the activities it will be carrying out and the role of each of&#13;
them in the new system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B3&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
6.    A seminar will have to be prepared on this subject, based on the knowledge and&#13;
message of the creators of the CNR and of the cadastral registry modernization project&#13;
and targeting the management of staff and those performing new activities. This new&#13;
seminar will take place in early 1996.&#13;
7.    An audiovisual presentation will also have to be prepared, intended for all&#13;
personnel taking into account the number of persons working in the different institutions-&#13;
even if this number were to be reduced, it would appear that this seminar would have to be&#13;
run several times (with a total of about 1,300 attendants). This audiovisual presentation&#13;
would also be suitable for showing to the public who use the center at the regional and&#13;
municipal offices.&#13;
Data Processing&#13;
8.    This training will be defined by the pilot project information technology study&#13;
according to the modification of procedures that will result and the training that the&#13;
equipment suppliers will include and that which may be received from other sources.&#13;
Training would start in early 1996 and:&#13;
(a)   basic program (Windows, database use programs) for 50 new staff or as&#13;
refresher training in different phases of the project; and&#13;
(b)   specialized programs covering languages and the UNIX system, designed&#13;
for the future data processing chiefs of the regional centers (4 + 2 in&#13;
security and for the central structure of the CNR).&#13;
New Specialized Equipment&#13;
9.    This will be for the specialized personnel need to use the following need&#13;
equipment:&#13;
(a)   restitution equipment;&#13;
(b)   GPS; and&#13;
(c)   electronic theodolites.&#13;
Currently, IGN staff is not familiar with those capabilities, which will be installed for&#13;
supervision of contract staff carrying out regularization (early 1996) and for carrying out&#13;
updating activities (starting in 1997).&#13;
10.   For point (a), four engineers will be needed with special training by the&#13;
manufacturers for the numerical stereo restitution functions and for operating the&#13;
orthoimage production system; two of these will require additional training in&#13;
aerotriangulation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B3&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
11.   For (b), the training will require the services of a foreign specialist who will have&#13;
to spend two weeks in El Salvador.&#13;
12.   For (c), the operators will have to be trained in the Central American&#13;
Technological Institute (ITCA) for one week.&#13;
13.   In addition, IGN topographic teams will be trained in stereo preparation methods.&#13;
It can be considered that the firm entrusted with work of this nature under the bidding for&#13;
the national project, will integrate this equipment with its own and will provide training, in&#13;
the form exchange, for all who can use the equipment already referred to.&#13;
Field Teams&#13;
14.   The IGN  has begun already training for the photoidentifiers and law students (in&#13;
preparation for the field phase of the pilot project). This training is being done in the&#13;
University of El Salvador's School of Agronomy. It consists of a week in work for the&#13;
photoidentifier and one week of applied law for identifying the property rights. This&#13;
training covers both the photoidentifiers and the law students hired for this work. The&#13;
duration of the training (15 days) is sufficient for personnel with some photoidentification&#13;
experience, but longer training will be needed for less qualified personnel.&#13;
15.   The training will have to be programmed in two phases, even if the photoidentifiers&#13;
have experience in dealing with legal problem (which are included in the second phase for&#13;
the training), since the law students have no experience as photoidentifiers. The staffing&#13;
numbers are based on the needs identified for the national plan's two implementation&#13;
phases.&#13;
Notaries, Proofreaders, Registrars and Surveyors&#13;
16.   Two types of public notaries have to be distinguished:&#13;
(a)   the notaries, proofreaders and  registrars involved in the work of the&#13;
national project; and&#13;
(b)   the notaries forming the corps of professionals who perform, on a private&#13;
basis, the preparation of the deeds, and also the surveyors who will be&#13;
required to identify the boundaries resulting from future physical changes in&#13;
a given property.&#13;
17.   For (a), the first purpose of the training will be to inform the notaries, proofreaders&#13;
and registrars regarding the new  legislative and regulatory provisions that set the&#13;
obligations, powers and responsibilities required by the new registry system. Another&#13;
purpose will be to train the notaries in the necessary mediation and conciliation techniques,&#13;
in view of their central role in this field, after the first selection of disputed cases identified&#13;
by the field teams. On the basis of 115 field teams and one notary for roughly four teams,&#13;
it will be necessary to train 30 notaries for the first phase of the national project and 30&#13;
more for the second (assuming that these specialists will not be transferred around). It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B3&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
should be noted that basic training is based on the assumption of training 30 notaries and&#13;
47 registrars for the first phase and then 30 notaries and 30 registrars for the second&#13;
phase. The number of proofreaders will be based on a ratio of four per registrar.&#13;
18.   For (b), it must be observed that more generally and outside of the project itself,&#13;
the two main groups of private professionals, notaries and surveyors, will tend to have&#13;
received training in data updating and standardization, with a view to obtaining a specific&#13;
registry approval. In view of the number of professionals involved, the organization work&#13;
will require considerable logistic capability and will benefit from project management&#13;
experience. In any event, the training will have to be funded by those concerned in order&#13;
to be up to date with the development of cadastral registry procedures. The CNR training&#13;
school is being established to provide this training with the bilateral assistance from Spain.&#13;
General Training Management&#13;
19.   The setting up of programs, the general organization of the courses and seminars,&#13;
the search for instructors, and the evaluation of the instruction given will require a&#13;
permanent staff person for the training needed for each of the phases. This person, who&#13;
will be responsible for the administration of the training plan and its development will&#13;
work with the UE Training Coordinator.&#13;

LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
CNR Financial Sustainability&#13;
Financial Analysis&#13;
1.    As part of the financial analysis of the land administration project, a cash-flow&#13;
analysis was prepared of the institutions involved in the project. During preparation, four&#13;
scenarios were analyzed. The scenarios varied in the assumptions governing the income-&#13;
generating capacity of the CNR, as well as the number of years required to complete the&#13;
project. In all four scenarios, net financing (including annual quotas for loan repayment)&#13;
proved positive throughout the period of analysis. This finding suggested that, even based&#13;
on conservative assumptions, the CNR should have sufficient liquidity to finance its&#13;
operations throughout the six years of the proposed land administration project.&#13;
Additionally, the CNR should prove to be financially sustainable once the project ends in&#13;
the year 2002 (see also Annex B5).&#13;
2.    The most conservative of the four scenarios analyzed in the study combined a low&#13;
income-generating assumption together with a project time horizon of six years. This&#13;
conservative scenario was selected as the base-case scenario for an analysis predicated&#13;
upon the final project cost estimates. If the cash-flow proves positive and the project&#13;
financially sustainable under conservative conditions, then under the more moderate&#13;
circumstances likely to prevail, no serious financial obstacles should be encountered. The&#13;
remainder of this section discusses the findings based on the revised project cost estimates.&#13;
Financial Synopsis&#13;
3.    The revised total cost of the land administration project is US$70 million (o612.7&#13;
million), with US$50 million (*37.9 million) provided by World Bank financing and&#13;
US$20 million (oI74.8 million) from counterpart finding. According to the base-case&#13;
scenario (see Annex B5, Table 1), the projected net income after financing is positive in all&#13;
project years (1996-2002). It should be noted that this result supposes an additional&#13;
contribution (besides counterpart finds) from GOES in the project's first two years (1996&#13;
and 1997), when some 38 percent of the project's investment purchases are expected to be&#13;
made.&#13;
Extracted from Roger Davis Pipe, Andlisis Financiero del Flujo de Caja, May 15, 1995. The study&#13;
examined a base case and three alternative scnarios--lower demand for ttlingfcadastal services,&#13;
slower project execton, and lower demand + slower execution. Each of the four shows positive net&#13;
cash flows over the life of the project; the flows are positive in all but one year of the first three cases,&#13;
and all but two years of the worst-case scenario.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B5&#13;
Page 2 of 11&#13;
4.    In years 4 and 6 of the project (1999 and 2001), the net income after financing is&#13;
greater than the counterpart contribution in the following year. Similarly, net income after&#13;
financing in year 5 is almost equal to the counterpart contribution in year 6 (net income is&#13;
¢42.1 million in 2000 compared with a counterpart contribution of ¢43.5 million in 2001).&#13;
This comparison implies that, in years 5 through 7,2 the counterpart contribution may be&#13;
generated entirely, or in large measure, from the activities of the CNR; additional financing&#13;
from the national budget would not be required.&#13;
5.    Additional financing from the national budget will, however, be required beginning&#13;
in 2003 to meet loan repayment obligations. In that year, projected net income before&#13;
financing is o34.3 million in nominal terms (US$2.3 million in 1995 dollars). The annual&#13;
loan repayment (principal plus interest) will amount to 044.5 million in nominal terms&#13;
(US$3 million in real terms).3 Thus, an additional o8.7 million (nominal), or US$0.6&#13;
million (real) will be required by GOES in 2003 to supplement CNR revenues. In&#13;
subsequent years, the GOES contribution toward loan repayment will be around ¢10.2&#13;
million (US$0.7 million).4 In other words, the CNR will be able to contribute 035 million&#13;
toward annual repayment quotas, or more than 75 percent of annual requirements. In&#13;
addition, cumulative net income after financing generated by the CNR throughout the&#13;
period from 1996 to 2003 totals o143.8 million, which can also be applied toward loan&#13;
amortization.&#13;
6.    The key to the financial strength of the project lies in the revenue-generating&#13;
capacity of the CNR through its registry activities. Even prior to project start-up (i.e,. in&#13;
1995), the annual revenues from combined RPRH, RSI, and IGN activities equaled an&#13;
estimated ¢55.3 million (US$6.3 million). Upon project completion (2003), annual CNR&#13;
revenues total ¢19.5 million in nominal terms, or US$8 million in constant 1995 dollars.&#13;
This 26 percent increase in the revenue-generating capacity of registry and cadastral&#13;
activities is not entirely due to the project, however. Part of the increased revenue stems&#13;
from the registry services provided to new properties that will be registered as a result of&#13;
the process of the ampliaci6n which occurs regardless of and independently from the&#13;
proposed project. The additional revenue that is directly attributable to the project,&#13;
measured by the incremental revenue generated directly by the activities associated with&#13;
the plan totals US$12.2 million between 1996-2003 and at least US$2.6 million each year&#13;
thereafter.&#13;
2 Although the land administration plan is a six-year project, it takes place over seven calendar years,&#13;
beginning in mid-1996 and running through mid-2002.&#13;
Principal and interest payments were calculated using blended quotas, assuming a 7 percent annual&#13;
rate of interest with a 17 year repayment period.&#13;
4  A final loan dibrsement of US$3.9 million is made in 2003; CNR net income before the GOES&#13;
contribution will thus be US$6.3 million plus US$3.9 million in the year 2004, assuming that income&#13;
and expenses remain constant.&#13;

Financial Sustainability&#13;
7.    CNR proves financially sustainable under the conservative assumptions of the base&#13;
case.5 Broadly defined, financial sustainability is the ability to finance fixed and variable&#13;
costs, as well as to finance the amortization of investment loans. A narrower definition&#13;
might exclude the loan amortization criterion. In considering the financial sustainability of&#13;
the CNR, both definitions are relevant. In the short run, the CNR should prove financially&#13;
sustainable according to the narrow definition. That is, the revenues generated from the&#13;
CNR registry and cadastral activities will be sufficient (in tandem with extemal financing)&#13;
to support the center's operating costs. Moreover, the income-generating capacity of the&#13;
CNR should be sufficient to contribute significantly each year to the loan amortization. In&#13;
the long-run, the CNR should also be self-sufficient, according to the broad definition of&#13;
the term.&#13;
8.    As mentioned above, cumulative income generated by plan-related activities from&#13;
1996 through 2003 totals 4182 million. In 2003, estimated annual revenues directly&#13;
attributable to the proposed project (i.e, from the national land regularization activities or&#13;
barrido and new services) total around ¢41 million. Assuming these annual revenues are&#13;
maintained, the CNR should be able to amortize the entire loan in 17 years.&#13;
9.    Another way to gauge the financial sustainability of the CNR is to compare&#13;
projected annual operating costs upon project completion with projected annual revenues.&#13;
Annual revenues must be equal to or greater than operating costs if the entity is to prove&#13;
financially sustainable in the long run. The annual operating costs of the CNR in 2003 are&#13;
estimated to be US$5.7 million in current (1995) dollars, including registry, cadastre, and&#13;
administration costs. Projected annual CNR revenue for the same year is US$8 million&#13;
(current dollars). This surplus of $2.3 million dollars will contribute to the loan's&#13;
amortization and ensure the long-run sustainability of the CNR.&#13;
10.   Incremental recurrent costs during the life of the project are calculated to equal&#13;
US$8.9 million (see Annex F). These costs may be divided into two categories: (a)&#13;
recurrent costs that occur exclusively during the life of the project; and (b) recurrent costs&#13;
that continue after project completion. For the purpose of gauging the long-term financial&#13;
sustainability of the project, the recurrent costs that continue after project completion are&#13;
of particular interest. It is important to ascertain whether annual revenues will finance&#13;
recurrent costs.&#13;
11.   Recurrent costs that will continue after project completion include those associated&#13;
with the institutional strengthening and decentralization component (US$2 million), and&#13;
the portion of the land record regularization component corresponding to vehicle&#13;
operation and maintenance (US$1.6 million). The remainder of recurrent costs associated&#13;
with the land record regularization component (US$5.4 million), the recurrent costs of the&#13;
5  These assumptions do not take into account Legislative Decree No. 471, approved on October 12,&#13;
1995, allowing staff retrenchment with indemnization defrayed by the Treasury.&#13;

project management unit (US$1.7 million), and those of the Project Preparation Facility&#13;
(US$0.2 million) will not continue after project completion. Thus, of the total recurrent&#13;
costs incurred during the project, only US$3.5 million will be required on an annual basis&#13;
upon project completion in 2002. Note, however, that this projection only represents the&#13;
incremental recurrent costs attributable directly to the project. Additional operating costs&#13;
will be incurred by the CNR. As mentioned, total CNR annual costs are projected to be&#13;
US$5.7 million in 2002.&#13;
12.   The CNR should prove self-financing through the increased revenues generated&#13;
from:&#13;
* broader user base as a result of having all parcels regularized, barrido nacional,&#13;
*  new services, and&#13;
*  higher volume of the processing capacity (currently there is a significant&#13;
backlog of unprocessed files for want of institutional capacity to process&#13;
applications in a timely fashion).&#13;
Timeliness of Financial Flows&#13;
13.   The annual cash flow analysis discussed above does not reveal the timeliness of the&#13;
financial flows. A quarterly cashflow analysis indicates that the cumulative net income&#13;
after financing is positive in all quarters. Table 2 shows that (a) this criterion is satisfied;&#13;
and (b) the timeliness of the financial flows ensures adequate liquidity in all quarters.&#13;
Quarterly cash flow information provides a better basis for discerning whether the inflows&#13;
are appropriately timed to outflows to ensure positive liquidity at all moments. For the&#13;
land administration project, the initial years are the most problematic. Most of the&#13;
procurement of goods occurs during the first three years of the project, whereas the&#13;
incremental income-generating capacity of the CNR is lagged by several years. But this lag&#13;
does not seem to present a financing problem on an annual basis. To determine whether&#13;
the distribution of outflows and inflows was appropriate on a more disaggregated level, a&#13;
quarterly cash flow breakdown was created for the initial six months of the project, when&#13;
many of the larger purchases of vehicles, computers, and equipment are expected to be&#13;
made. If no cashflow problems are detected during this critical period (assuming a one&#13;
semester lag in Bank disbursements), then the timeliness of the financial flows wiDl be&#13;
considered adequate. To avoid this cash crunch, the CNR will request direct payment to&#13;
suppliers.&#13;
14.   Table 2 provides the results of the quarterly cash flow analysis for 1996. Revenue&#13;
estimates are derived from Table 1. It is assumed that revenue is evenly distributed&#13;
between quarters. The expenses reported for the CNR are the combined expenses of the&#13;
RPHP, RSI, and IGN-again, distributed evenly between quarters. The expenses shown&#13;
under the Land Administration Project are the programmed expenses during the first six&#13;
months of the project. In the financing section of the Table, it is assumed that the Bank's&#13;
first disbursement does not take place until 1997. In practice, it may be possible for a first&#13;
disbursement to be made in the final quarter of 1996, if the procurement work is well&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B5&#13;
Page 5 of 11&#13;
advanced by the project management unit before the project begins in earnest. The analysis&#13;
assumes zero disbursement in 1996 to explore the cashflow repercussions. Financing from&#13;
GOES is assumed to equal s64 million for both counterpart contribution and the normal&#13;
allocation from the ordinary budget to defray all three constituent agencies' staff cost.&#13;
This has proven conservative given 1995 legislative public sector staff retrenchment.&#13;
15.   Those items in Table 2 marked with an asterisk would be procured through a&#13;
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) cost-sharing agreement. For this&#13;
reason, they do not appear in the column totals; from the project's perspective, the&#13;
procurement of these items does not represent a cash outflow. Instead, UNDP will&#13;
purchase the items with its own funds, and then be reimbursed directly by the World Bank&#13;
upon submission of the disbursement requests. This arrangement is key to the financial&#13;
liquidity of the project in its start-up phase. Without the assistance of UNDP, additional&#13;
funding would be required by GOES from its ordinary budget during the project's first&#13;
year.&#13;
Methodology and Assumptions&#13;
16.   A complete description of the methodologies and assumptions used to derive the&#13;
cashflow projection is detailed in the Analisis Financiero. Following is a summary of the&#13;
methodology used to derive the revenue estimates. Since the revenue from registry&#13;
services will provide most of the income to the CNR6, the discussion focuses on the&#13;
methodology used to estimate the registry revenues. Annual registry revenues are&#13;
calculated by multiplying the estimated demand for registration services by the fee for each&#13;
service. The methodology used to derive the demand estimates is discussed first, followed&#13;
by an explanation of the fee calculations.&#13;
17.   Demand for registration services befall on: RPRH and the RSI. In turn, demand for&#13;
RSI services comes from two sources: (a) demand resulting from the ampliaci6n process&#13;
(by which properties registered under folio personal are transferred to folio real); (b)&#13;
demand resulting from the barrido, National Land Regularization component.&#13;
6. In 1994, combined registry and cadastral income was i59.3 million; of this amount, registry income&#13;
(RPRH and RSI) was o58.5 million.&#13;

Demand from the Ampliacidn&#13;
18.   The starting point in calculating the total number of requests presented each year&#13;
due to the ampliaci6n is to estimate the total number of properties in El Salvador for the&#13;
period of analysis. To calculate the total number of properties, the initial or base number&#13;
of properties and the annual growth rate in new properties must be known. Unfortunately,&#13;
the base number of properties in El Salvador is unknown. However, the 1992 household&#13;
census reported 1.2 million houses, including urban and rural areas. The question is: how&#13;
many rural properties without housing and commercial properties exist? For the cashflow&#13;
projections reported in the Andlisis Financiero, two scenarios were hypothesized: the first&#13;
assumed a total property base of 1.8 million, while the second assumed a base of 1.4&#13;
million properties. The base-case scenario summarized above is based on this lower&#13;
assumption.&#13;
19.   Similarly, two scenarios were assumed for the annual growth rate of new&#13;
properties. The first scenario assumed an annual increase of 60,000 properties, while the&#13;
second assumed an increase of 30,000. The first estimate of 60,000 units is based on the&#13;
current rate of property creation. Using the methodology described above (whereby 40&#13;
percent of total requests are estimated to correspond to real estate transactions, and 50&#13;
percent of these transactions are estimated to correspond to new lotification), the&#13;
estimated number of new properties in 1994 can be calculated as follows:&#13;
NEW PROPERTIES = 268,000 * 0.4 * 0.5 = 53,600&#13;
There are two reason why new property creation in 1995 and beyond may be somewhat&#13;
higher than 53,600 units. On the one hand, the Plan Nacional is expected to stimulate&#13;
investment in property development. On the other hand, a strong demand for new housing&#13;
is likely to result over the next decade due to the existing demographics (a high proportion&#13;
of the Salvadorian population is under age 24). For these two reasons, an annual increase&#13;
of 60,000 new properties is not unrealistic. Thus, the alternate scenario of 30,000 new&#13;
properties should prove to be a very conservative estimate. This lower assumption was&#13;
used for the base-case scenario.&#13;
20.   Number of Properties. The scenario for the base-case cash flow conservatively&#13;
assumes a low initial base of 1.4 million properties together with the low annual growth&#13;
estimate of 30,000 new properties. If the CNR proves financial sustainable under this low-&#13;
demand assumption, then there is good reason to suppose that the goal of financial&#13;
sustainability can be achieved.&#13;
21.   Registry Service Demand Index. With the number of properties projected, the&#13;
next step in calculating the demand for registry services is to derive a demand index based&#13;
on historical data. The demand index is defined as the percentage of registry requests&#13;
generated per hundred properties. The index is calculated by dividing total requests by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B5&#13;
Page 9 of 11&#13;
total properties. Assuming the initial base of 1.4 million properties, and given the&#13;
estimated total number of requests in 1995, the demand index for 1995 is 19. The cash-&#13;
flow projections reported in the previous Andlisis Financiero assume that the demand&#13;
index remains constant throughout the period of analysis. In point of fact, there are two&#13;
reasons why the index might actually increase: on the one hand, because of the increased&#13;
efficiency of the modernized registry; and on the other hand, due to new services that will&#13;
be offered through the modernized registry. However, to ensure conservative revenue&#13;
estimates, the demand index is held constant.&#13;
22.   Estimated Demand from Ampliaci6n. Using these three elements-base number&#13;
of properties, annual property growth, and the demand index-the estimated number of&#13;
requests from the process of the ampliacion was calculated (i.e., the requests that will&#13;
result from the normal process of growth in the demand for services of the modernized&#13;
registry, regardless of the project.&#13;
Demand Due to the Bamdo&#13;
23.   In addition to the demand for registry services due to the ampliaci6n process,&#13;
demand for services will also be created due to the barrido nacional. To estimate the&#13;
demand created by the barrido, calculate the number of properties that will be&#13;
incorporated into the modernized registry as a result of the barrido. This number, in turn,&#13;
is equal to the number of properties covered by the barrido in a given year, minus the&#13;
number of those properties that are already registered in the RSI.&#13;
24.   Number of Properties. The annual universe of the barrido was calculated by&#13;
estimating the number of properties in each departamento (based on the 1992 household&#13;
census, the proportional weight of each departamento in that census, and the estimated&#13;
total property base of 1.4 million in the conservative scenario).&#13;
25.   The number of requests already registered in the RSI in a given year is estimated as&#13;
the total number of properties registered in the RSI in a given time period multiplied by&#13;
the estimated proportion of those properties that fall within the targeted area of the&#13;
barrido in a given year. In turn, the estimated number of properties registered in the RSI&#13;
in a given time period is equal to the initial number of properties in the RSI (currently&#13;
there are 77,800 properties registered in the RSI) plus the number of properties that enter&#13;
the RSI through the process of the ampliaci6n. It was assumed that (a) 90 percent of the&#13;
initial RSI registries and 59 percent of new RSI registries fall in the central and western&#13;
zones (1 and 2)7; and (b) these existing RSI properties are equally distributed throughout&#13;
the two zones. It was also assumed that one-third of the total existing and new RSI&#13;
7. The majority of properties that are at present registered in the RSI are in the departamentos that make&#13;
up the central and western zones; hence the assignation of 90 percent. The distribution of properties&#13;
that enter the RSI through the process of the ampliaci6n is based on the weighted percentage of&#13;
requests presented in 1994 by the departamentos that make up each of the two phases of the barrido.&#13;
The departamentos in phase 1 (comprising zones 1 and 2) were responsible for 59 percent of the total&#13;
requests in 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B5&#13;
Page 10 of 11&#13;
properties will fall within the programmed barrido territory in a given year. For the&#13;
northern and eastem zones (3 and 4), it was assumed that (a) the proportions of initial and&#13;
new RSI registries were 10 percent (existing ) and 41 percent (new); and (b) one half of&#13;
these existing registries will fall within the barrido territory of each zone in each of the&#13;
two years that the barrido is expected to take.&#13;
26.   In each year of the project a certain geographic area will be covered. Subtracting&#13;
the number of requests already existing in the RSI in this area from the total number of&#13;
properties in that area will reveal the number of properties that will enter the RSI each&#13;
year as a result of the barrido. These properties will in turn generate demand for RSI&#13;
services in subsequent years. The cashflow projections assume that the demand index for&#13;
services is equal to 15. That is, the number of requests generated by the barrido is&#13;
assumed to be 15 percent of the cumulative total of properties that entered into the RSI&#13;
registry as a result of the barrido. Thus, for example, the number of requests generated by&#13;
the barrido in year 3 is equal to 15 percent of the properties entered into the RSI registry&#13;
in years I plus 2.&#13;
27.   To recapitulate, the total number of requests presented to the RSI in a given year&#13;
is equal to the sum of requests derived from the ampliaci6n plus those derived from the&#13;
barrido. The above paragraphs described the methodology used to derive the estimated&#13;
number of requests-in other words, the estimated demand for registry services. This&#13;
estimated demand provides one element of the information needed to calculate the revenue&#13;
generated from registry services. The other element required is the price of those services,&#13;
or the tariffs associated with each registry service.&#13;
Tariffs&#13;
28.   Each service has a specific fee associated with it. However, in order to simplify the&#13;
calculation of revenues, an average tariff was derived by dividing the total revenue&#13;
received from registration services by the total number of service requests. For the cash-&#13;
flow projections, the 1993 revenues of the RPRH were used.8 In that year, revenues for&#13;
registry services totaled o41.6 million, and there were 219,000 requests, resulting in an&#13;
average tariff of j?1 90. This average tariff of 4190 was used as the basis for calculating the&#13;
projected revenues from registry services. An annual inflation rate on tariff revenues was&#13;
assumed to be half of the local cost inflation rate (4 percent tariff inflation versus 8 percent&#13;
cost inflation). Total revenues from registry services were then calculated by multiplying&#13;
the projected number of requests by the average tariff.&#13;
8. The year 1994 was considered to be an anomaly because a disproportionate number of large&#13;
properties were recorded. The average tariff of the requests was therefore higher than it was in 1993,&#13;
and since the observed and expected tendency is toward smaller lotification, it was felt that 1993 was&#13;
a more representative year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex BS&#13;

Need for Maintaining the Average Tariff&#13;
29.   The revenue-generating capacity of the CNR depends on both the demand for&#13;
services (number of requests) and the tariffs charged for each service. Since very&#13;
conservative assumptions were used to estimate the number of requests for registry&#13;
services, it is reasonable to believe that these projections are achievable. However, for the&#13;
projected CNR revenue to be achieved, the average tariff level assumed in the cashflow&#13;
analysis would have to maintained or surpassed. If the demand for registry services proves&#13;
to be higher than the base-case scenario, then the projected revenues could be achieved&#13;
with an average tariff level lower than the one used in the analysis. But assuming that the&#13;
base-case demand scenario is accurate, then the tariff structure for registry services will be&#13;
a key factor in CNR's financial sustainabilty.&#13;
30.   One possible means of ensuring adequate revenue is to include in the loan&#13;
covenant a specific conditionality concerning the maintenance of average tariff levels. This&#13;
method, however, is not recommended, because it would prove awkward to implement,&#13;
given the wide range of services provided. In addition, because the proportional mix of&#13;
services varies from year to year, it would be impossible to predict the average tariff in any&#13;
given year. In any event, there is some evidence that the tendency is for the average tariff&#13;
to rise, rather than fall. To the extent that tariffs are based on property values, the average&#13;
tariff is likely (at least) to keep pace with inflation, since in the long run the rate of&#13;
increase in property prices outpaces the general rate of inflation. Offsetting this possibility,&#13;
however, is the tendency toward smaller property divisions in urban areas, which could&#13;
have a downward tendency on the average tariff. On the other hand, subdivided properties&#13;
generally have a higher market value than the initial property, so-while the impact of&#13;
subdivision on the average tariff may be negative-the impact on overall revenue&#13;
generation should be positive&#13;
31.   Another way of ensuring sustainable cash flow for CNR would be to include a&#13;
legal covenant requiring that the GOES provide annual supplementary financing (i.e.,&#13;
above and beyond counterpart contributions) as required, based on an annual review of&#13;
budgetary projections. Such a requirement would encourage GOES to adopt a tariff&#13;
regime that helps ensure CNR's financial fluidity. This requirement, however, would&#13;
dupublicate the legal requirement established in Legislative Decree No. 462 establishing&#13;
the CNR that it have tariffs that ensure its self-financing and barring fee waivers.&#13;

EL SALVADOR&#13;
LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
SUMMARY TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TARIFF AD Hoc REVIEW&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    El Salvador's Land Administration Plan has established an administratively and&#13;
financially autonomous National Registry Center (NRC) responsible for all registry and&#13;
cadastre activities throughout the country. As a part of this process, the tariff structure for the&#13;
registry and cadastral services needs to be reviewed from time to time. The purpose of this&#13;
review is two-fold:&#13;
* to ensure the financial viability of the NRC by identifying a progressive tariff&#13;
structure that will provide universal access to services, while ensuring financial&#13;
sustainability,&#13;
*  to simplify the existing tariff structure if warrented.&#13;
2.     Traditionally, the institutions which provide registry and cadastre services have not&#13;
functioned on a financially autonomous basis. As a result, the tariff structure for services is not&#13;
predicated upon the criterion of overall cost recovery. . Recently, it has been approved that the&#13;
CNR have financial autonomy, which provides an excellent opportunity to review its tariff&#13;
structure. And while a progressive tariff structure will likely include the cross-subsidization of&#13;
certain services, or graduated tariffs based on the economic capacity of clients, it is essential&#13;
that the tariff structure as a whole follow a financial logic that will permit the CNR's long-term&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
3.     The existing tariffs structure for registry services consists of a myriad of different&#13;
tariffs, leading to confusion in their application and high administrative costs. Simplification of&#13;
this structure should be reviewed.&#13;
Objective&#13;
4.     The objective of the study is review how to systematize and simplify the tariff structure,&#13;
in order to ensure both the accessibility of the cadastral and registry services and the financial&#13;
viability of the National Registry Center.&#13;
Activities&#13;
5.     Develop an overall tariff strategy for cadaster and registry services based on the&#13;
concepts of financial sustainability and universal coverage. Identify the profile of the targeted&#13;
client base and determine tariff thresholds for the various services, identifying which services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B6&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
should be subsidized by surpluses generated by other registry services, and which should be&#13;
subject to a progressive structure based on graduated tariffs.&#13;
6.    Identify all the registry and cadastral services, including existing services as well as any&#13;
new services resulting from the modernization of the registry. Calculate the costs associated&#13;
with each service. Review the present administrative process concerning the provision of&#13;
services. Where appropriate, recommend organizational arrangements that will simplifying&#13;
their administration and ensure the provision of services on a least-cost basis.&#13;
7.     Compare current tariffs with the real costs of each service and recommend a new tariff&#13;
structure that will balance the accessibility criterion (according to which tariffs are set in&#13;
accordance with the users' ability to pay) along with the criterion of financial sustainability.&#13;
Explore ways to simpify the tariff structure, identifying criteria for grouping tariffs into related&#13;
"families", and developing recommendations for a streamlined structure. Group tariffs by class&#13;
(i.e. cost recovery; subsidized, fixed-rate, variable-rate, or progressive). Estimate the demand&#13;
for new registry and cadaster services that the will be provided. Identify a tariff strategy for&#13;
these new services, encompassing governmental and municipal users of registry information.&#13;
8.     Prepare a seven-year cashflow analysis for the institutions involved in the registry and&#13;
cadaster services, using the World Bank's SAR financial projections and other relevant data as&#13;
a basis. Undertake sensitivity analysis to explore the irnplications of different assumptions&#13;
regarding costs and revenues. The purpose of the analysis is to validate the recommended tariff&#13;
structure, and provide evidence of its ability to ensure the NCR's financial sustainability.&#13;
9.     Define the role that municipalities will play within the context of decentralized land&#13;
registry services. Explore the advantages and disadvantages of altematives for distributing&#13;
revenues to municipalities that will encourage their active participation. Based on this analysis&#13;
and consultation with stakeholders, recommend the most appropriate revenue-sharing&#13;
mechanism.&#13;
Expected Product&#13;
10.    The study will include recommendations on a new  registry and cadastral tariff&#13;
structure; a complete list of recommended tariffs together with an explanation and a financial&#13;
and/or social justification, cash-flow projections will include a sensitivity analysis; as well as a&#13;
description of problems and advantages of the recommended structure, including summary&#13;
tables and statistical annexes.&#13;
11.   The final product will be presented at a meeting with the CNR Board.&#13;

LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
The Pilot Project Experience&#13;
Pilot Project Activities&#13;
1.    The pilot project's activities financed by PRISA (Loan 3576-ES) are the following:&#13;
(a)   Works, equipment, consultant services and training, salaries and operating&#13;
costs to carry out land registry and cadastral activities covering all 16&#13;
municipalities (122,600 hectares) in Sonsonate Department. This mission&#13;
includes aerial photography, office and field updating of the land registry&#13;
and cadastral records, and establishment of a parcel-based land registry and&#13;
cadastre system. As part of project preparation, an experimental phase was&#13;
carried out. It included land regularization field surveys in two&#13;
municipalities (about 5,800 hectares) using 1980 cadastral maps (i.e.,&#13;
without the aerial photography). The findings from this experimental phase&#13;
were used to design the pilot and national projects (see paras. 16-27).&#13;
(b)   Equipment, consultant services, and training to establish a consolidated&#13;
office of legal and cadastral registry in Sonsonate and data stations in&#13;
several municipalities.&#13;
(c)   Consultant services to carry out a study of legal and institutional&#13;
requirements of the new National Registry (CNR), including mechanisms&#13;
for alternative dispute resolution to resolve registration and cadastral&#13;
conflicts.&#13;
(b)   Consultant services, salaries, operating costs for the project implementation&#13;
unit (LIE), which is responsible for project supervision, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation and administration.&#13;
Detailed Project Description&#13;
2.    As indicated above, the pilot project consists of three subcomponents. They are&#13;
described in this section.&#13;
3.    Land Registry and Cadastral Activities. This subcomponent includes the land&#13;
data acquisition activities. These activities include all steps to capture information from the&#13;
Sonsonate land registry's 1,800 land-record volumes, digitalize the IGN-maintained&#13;
cadastre and link the grantee-based records (folios personales) to the individual parcel-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
based registry records (folios reales), and establish new cadastral maps from aerial photos.&#13;
See Flowchart 1 on page 8. The product of this subcomponent are the field-verified folios&#13;
reales (i.e., parcel-based files for each parcel identified in the aerial photography) ready to&#13;
be integrated into an automated land information system (LIS).&#13;
4.    Establishment of a Consolidated Legal and Cadastral Registry Office. This&#13;
subcomponent includes the institutional development activities to transform the Sonsonate&#13;
registry and the IGN office into a consolidated cadastral registry ( i.e., constituted of&#13;
parcel-based unified alphanumeric and graphic records). These activities range from (a)&#13;
training registry staff in the capture of thefoliospersonales in digital form and replacing&#13;
the traditional folio personal system by installing an automated RSI unit (thus&#13;
extinguishing the traditional RPRH system) to (b) receiving the field-verified folios reales&#13;
into the LIS for the completed verified area. The product of this subcomponent is an&#13;
operating RSI unit handling the LIS unified (alphanumeric) legal and graphic (cadastral)&#13;
folios reales. Once the LIS is installed and the records are uploaded, the project finances&#13;
the training of computer operators and the installation of municipal computer stations&#13;
linked by modem to the LIS. These stations will have 'read-only" capabilities and will be&#13;
able to provide certifications of information in the LIS and receive service requests for the&#13;
regional office.&#13;
5.    Study of CNR's Legal and Institutional Requirements. This subcomponent&#13;
includes the hiring of consultants to carry out the detailed work to consolidate the&#13;
operation of the CNR. Because the CNR is the agglomeration of the National Registry&#13;
(land and commerce), including the RSI and IGN, its operations need to be streamlined.&#13;
As such, its legal mandate remains the same as that of its original institutions and therefore&#13;
needs no new laws or regulations to operate. However, under a single authority, it can&#13;
streamline its operations and avoid duplications (i.e., at present, there are cadastral offices&#13;
in the registry and in the IGN as well). The study will identify ways to make CNR more&#13;
efficient and recommend further legal and institutional changes.&#13;
6.    Project Executing Unit. This subcomponent includes financing for equipment,&#13;
consultants, staff, and operating costs to manage the project. The activities of this&#13;
subcomponent include the management, supervision, quality control, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, procurement, accounting and disbursement, as well as coordination with other&#13;
executing units within CNR (directorate of CNR, RSI, RPRH) or other agencies (UNDP,&#13;
Ministry of Justice, MIPLAN, ILP).&#13;
Project Implementation, Procurement, and Disbursement&#13;
7.    The executing unit (UE) will manage project implementation, procurement and&#13;
disbursements.&#13;
8.    Project Implementation Unit. The UE was created to manage this pilot project.&#13;
The unit is currently composed of a project manager and nine technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
administrative staff, as well as four support staff. (see organizational chart 1 in Annex E4).&#13;
This unit will be bolstered by a team of three resident consultants from an international&#13;
firm (KADASTER) hired to carry out the bulk of the subproject, under terms of reference&#13;
and international competitive procedures satisfactory to the Bank. The team will&#13;
temporarily be supported with short-term international staff with specific technical&#13;
specialties, as required.&#13;
9.    Based on the lessons learned from the experience (see para. 15)., the project UE&#13;
will prepare terms of reference for the works to be done in-house and the work to be&#13;
contracted out to private firms. Flow chart 1 presents the steps involved. The work to be&#13;
done in-house includes (a) establishing a database with all Sonsonate land registry&#13;
information (a first step to constituting parcel-based records); (b) strengthening CNR staff&#13;
(i.e., training, equipment) to receive the folios reales; (c) establishing the municipal data&#13;
stations after the LIS is operational; and (d) preparing project management,&#13;
administration, and supervision of work functions to be continued-at a larger scale-in&#13;
the national project. The works contracted to an international firm include (a) establishing&#13;
the updated cadastral maps based on aerial photography; (b) processing the field&#13;
regularization steps to convert the database information from the Sonsonate registry to&#13;
folios reales; (c) designing and establishing an automated LIS; (d) building the institutional&#13;
capacity (i.e., training, technical assistance) to receive the folios reales and integrate them&#13;
in the LIS; and (e) carrying out the study of legal and institutional requirements noted in&#13;
para. 5. This process requires intense management and close coordination due to&#13;
dovetailed activities.&#13;
10.   The firm is responsible for the work of local subcontractors, including quality&#13;
control of all tasks.&#13;
11.   Implementation Schedule. A timetable for project implementation was agreed&#13;
with the firm. The pilot project started in October 1994, and it is slated to finish in March&#13;
1997. Timetable 1 in Annex C2 summarizes the steps and time required to complete the&#13;
pilot project.&#13;
12.   Procurement. Procurement will be conducted in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
Because UE is part of a decentralized agency of the Ministry of Justice, it must operate&#13;
under archaic GOES procurement procedures. In order to accelerate project&#13;
implementation, CNR has requested UNDP support for procurement and hiring of&#13;
consultants under a cost-sharing agreement. UNDP has been supporting the Bank-&#13;
supported PRISA project from the beginning, favorably contributing to its execution of 32&#13;
disbursements. Again, under the UNDP agreement, UNDP prefinances the project's&#13;
disbursements.&#13;
13.   Accounts and Auditing. The project keeps separate accounts and a separate&#13;
special account from the other PRISA components under the Ministry of Agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
14.   Project Management and Information System. The project is preparing a&#13;
management and information system (MIS) to monitor progress of implementation and&#13;
identify problems. In addition, as part of the PRISA implementation and impact indicators,&#13;
the project will establish indicators and baselines before the end of 1995. The proposed&#13;
land administration project will have the same MIS and indicators as this pilot (see Annex&#13;
G).&#13;
Lessons of Experience from the Experimental Phase of Pilot Project in Sonsonate&#13;
Department&#13;
15.  Implementing the experimental phase and planning the pilot phase taught the&#13;
project executing unit several important lessons that are being applied in the planning and&#13;
programming of the pilot phase and national project. The 1994 experimental phase-from&#13;
October 1994 to March 1995-covered 5,800 hectares in two municipalities in Sonsonate&#13;
Department: Santa Catarina Mazahaut and Santo Domingo Guzman. The rest of the pilot&#13;
project-from March 1995 to March 1997-covers Sonsonate's remaining 94,000&#13;
hectares. The lessons were particularly useful in the definition of tasks to be completed by&#13;
the UE and the international firm or its subcontractors.&#13;
Lessons Learned for Design of National Project&#13;
16.   The experimental phase served as a learning experience to (a) better define the&#13;
activities required for planning, programming, budgeting, and contracting the finalization&#13;
of land regularization activities for the remainder of the department; (b) identify the legal&#13;
and institutional requirements for incorporating the resulting parcel-based information into&#13;
a unified legal and cadastral land registry in Sonsonate; and (c) identify ways to avoid&#13;
pitfalls in the pilot and national projects.&#13;
17.  Implementation of the experimental phase has led to changes in almost every facet&#13;
of program implementation, from records examination and compilation in municipal&#13;
registries to the organization of fieldwork and dispute resolution.&#13;
18.   The first step in moving from a land registration system tied to a grantee-based&#13;
folio personal record of properties to a parcel-based folio real system requires a massive&#13;
search through land registration volumes (some dating back to the 1880s). Each parcel&#13;
must be tracked through its successive owners (inscriptions on the volumes are&#13;
sequential). The original plan was to hire outside personnel to photocopy the record of&#13;
each parcel as it moved through the 200 registry volumes (for the two municipalities in the&#13;
experimental phase-the pilot phase includes 1,800 volumes). Next, the plan was to&#13;
arrange the copies by municipality and parcel. These steps proved extremely time&#13;
consuming, and the executing unit began experimenting with taking advantage of the&#13;
"know-how" of registrar assistants (confrontadores) by training them to use computers&#13;
and enter registration data directly into a database programmed to carry out the sorting&#13;
function. The database is shared in a computer network; this system allows not only the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
use of confrontadores to enter data in the database it also allows the keeping of books in&#13;
the registry for simultaneous consultation by the public. These changes greatly speeded&#13;
record conversion, while providing the registrars skills that will greatly increase their&#13;
employment prospects as the entire land registration system is modernized; the 17&#13;
registrars who participated in the experimental phase have been hired as trainers for the&#13;
pilot phase. Once the required information in these volumes has been transcribed, the&#13;
traditional registry expires and the automated procedures of the "social registry" take over.&#13;
The staff for this unit of the RSI is constituted by the on-the-job trained staff that prepared&#13;
the records-the confrontadores-and staff from the RSI.&#13;
19.   Cadastral fieldwork underwent a similar evolution. Promotion campaigns proved&#13;
effective in preparing municipalities and outlying agricultural areas for visits by mapping&#13;
teams. But the original plan of inserting seven-person teams of mappers and law students&#13;
into a 50 square kilometer area for four weeks did not work well. Progress was slow&#13;
because plot owners were often off-property when the teams visited. The procedure was&#13;
altered to schedule each area for two visits of 14 days each. During the first visit, and after&#13;
the information campaign, the teams stayed in the municipal center so landowners could&#13;
come to them to show their land property documentation; this strategy gave the teams a&#13;
picture of the properties that faced mapping or legal problems. It also allowed the teams&#13;
to draw up an efficient program and schedule used by additional cadastral and legal teams&#13;
two months later during a follow-up, 14-day visit.&#13;
20.   Informal dispute adjudication, one of the project's other key functions, also&#13;
benefited from being centralized in municipalities. At the beginning of the experimental&#13;
phase notary teams were sent into the countryside. This effort caused many problems&#13;
because claimants often lacked necessary papers, or the parties to disputes were not all&#13;
available. The system was revised to include newspaper announcements that gave the&#13;
details of each dispute and the days that the notaries would be available in municipal&#13;
centers to attempt to mediate them.&#13;
21.   The notary offices in the municipalities have also undertaken promotional work by&#13;
offering guidance and advice to landholders who lack the proper papers to register their&#13;
properties (i.e., on procedures to obtain adverse possession certification and formalizing&#13;
successions).&#13;
22.   The experimental phase also led to some organization simplification expected to&#13;
benefit the project's later phases. When it began, the project executing unit took on almost&#13;
all coordinating responsibility, hiring consultants to carry out cadastral mapping, as well as&#13;
law students and notaries to handle the legal aspects of land regularization. The unit soon&#13;
found the burden of organizing and coordinating schedules too great, and the system was&#13;
changed to make the mapping engineers the leaders of self-contained teams that included&#13;
the notaries and law students.&#13;
23.   Another lesson was the timing required for completion of procurement procedures.&#13;
International competitive bidding (ICB) took about six months, and national competitive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
bidding (NCB) about four months. Because the Ministry of Justice's budget lacked an&#13;
investment category, the budgetary resources could not be expended; thus implementation&#13;
prefinanced by the UNDP facilitated payments for the purchase and hiring of consultants.&#13;
Achievements vs. Expectations, So Far&#13;
24.   The pilot project is programmed to be completed in March 1997. The&#13;
achievements so far key on operational, technical, and administrative aspects. The&#13;
operational aspects include lessons learned from the following activities: (a) planning and&#13;
carrying out the information campaign preceding fieldwork for the two municipalities in&#13;
the experimental phase; (b) training and hiring field staff; (c) carrying out the field&#13;
regularization surveys; (d) collecting and analyzing primary data on the actual field&#13;
situation; (e) communicating with beneficiaries on their perception of benefits and costs of&#13;
the program; (f) defining terms of reference and carrying out an actual competition for&#13;
selection of the international firm, including the selection, negotiation, and contracting&#13;
process; and (g) carrying out the internal budgeting and processing to obtain the PRISA&#13;
loan (Loan 3576-ES) amendment approved by the Bank and the Legislature, with the&#13;
budget allocated and the procurement and disbursement staff and procedures in place.&#13;
25.   Although the achievements were many, so were the disappointments. After the&#13;
experimental phase' s fieldwork, all verified parcel-based files were sent to the UE and&#13;
IGN for calculation of the parcel area and updating of the legal and cadastral records. The&#13;
IGN was not able to update the cadastre and it was found that deeds were also registered&#13;
at the Santa Ana office. Consequently, the land market in the two municipalities followed&#13;
its usual course, and since there was no graphic section of the record to guide the&#13;
substitution of the traditional registry to the RSI system for the two municipalities, the&#13;
verified parcel-based records were not integrated into the RSI database. Thus the records&#13;
are being updated but cannot be entered into the registry. This experience pointed out the&#13;
need to install the RSI unit at the levantamiento phase and the impossibility to regularize&#13;
only partial areas reporting to more than one registry office.&#13;
26    Costs. The experimental phase of the pilot project provided tested estimates of&#13;
the cost of fieldwork, team productivity, and skill mix required. The negotiation of the&#13;
contract for the pilot phase provided cost estimates of the photogrammetry, equipment,&#13;
and other inputs. The costs derived from the contract negotiation with the main firm were&#13;
used for the cost estimates of the national program.&#13;
27.   Data Acquired by the Experimental Phase. Only by actually carrying out the&#13;
work can a fact-based assessment of the magnitude of the problem be made. The&#13;
experimental phase in two Sonsonate municipalities-Santa Catarina Mazahuat and Santo&#13;
Domingo Guzman-provided some of the data, which is in Annex C 1.&#13;

LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
LAND DATA ACQUISITION COMPONENT&#13;
1.    This Annex describes the objectives, activities, and management of the land data&#13;
acquisition component. The design of this component imbeds the lessons learned of the&#13;
pilot project for the land administration project, financed under the Agricultural Sector&#13;
Reform and Investment Loan (3576-ES), described in Annex C.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
2.    The objectives of the component is to regularize land registration for El Salvador's&#13;
rural and urban land. The newly established parcel-based land records will become the&#13;
only official land registry in El Salvador. These records will be installed in the land&#13;
information system and registration methodologies being established under the pilot&#13;
described in Annex C.&#13;
National Program&#13;
3.    Component activities would be national, except for Sonsonate. The table below&#13;
indicates areas to be covered.&#13;

Technical Aspects&#13;
4.    This section provides the bases for the technical recommendations included in&#13;
project design, including draft terms of reference. The sections are (a) activities&#13;
programming; (b) mapping; and (c) land registry system and automated land information&#13;
system (LIS).&#13;
5.    Activities Programming.  Project activities are divided into three aspects:&#13;
barrido, ampliaci6n, and institutional strengthening. The barrido is the land&#13;
regularization; ampliacion is the coverage of all boundary changes by the RSI; and&#13;
institutional development is the CNR evolution necessary to integrate the barrido into the&#13;
LIS and keep it up to date. The land data acquisition component deals with the barrido,&#13;
the institutional strengthening and decentralization component with the ampliaci6n and&#13;
CNR strengthening, and the project administration component with the management of the&#13;
entire process.&#13;
6.    The barrido would take place in two large phases, covering two zones every&#13;
phase. The two zones in the first phase are the Central (San Salvador, La Libertad,&#13;
Cuscatlan) and Western (Ahuachapan, Chalatenango, Santa Ana, and Sonsonate). The two&#13;
zones in the second phase are the Northern (San Miguel, Cabarias, and San Vicente) and&#13;
Eastern (Morazan, La Union, Usulutan). The phasing was decided on the bases of&#13;
required number of field verification teams, so that the same number (115) was required&#13;
for each phase. Requirement was based on number of orthoimages and percentage of&#13;
urban area in each region, difficulty of the fieldwork (with urban and noncadastred&#13;
northern border areas considered most difficult), and road network facilities for logistic&#13;
purposes (i.e., team drop-off and pickup, lodging proximity).&#13;
7.    The amplfaci6n is not directly supported by the project. It is a self-financed&#13;
activity of the RSI. It creates in parallel, and in areas not yet covered by the barrido,&#13;
updated land records with legal and physical information for small perimeters that involved&#13;
boundary changes. These small perimeters need not be revisited during the barrido. The&#13;
small-scale handling by RSI of these boundary changes and fragmentations in an integrated&#13;
legal/cadastral manner creates experience in the institution to prepare it for the massive&#13;
verification/registration process of files established under the barrido.&#13;
8.    Institutional strengthening has started under the pilot phase financed under PRISA.&#13;
The international firm hired to conduct the technical activities of the pilot phase will also&#13;
design the automated land information system (LIS) required by the Salvadoran&#13;
registration process. The firm will also conduct the institutional study to consolidate the&#13;
CNR. These tasks are programmed to be completed prior to entering the massive&#13;
Sonsonate barrido data into the LIS in late 1996 or early 1997.&#13;
9.    Mapping. This task is the framework of the land register, which allows the&#13;
localization of the parcel rights. The task is complex and will require close supervision by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
project management. Moreover, the terms of reference in Annex DI can be improved in&#13;
light of the experience in the pilot Sonsonate phase financed under PRISA (Loan 3576-&#13;
ES). The CNR is aware that it is critical to realize the aerophotogrammetry as soon as&#13;
possible, at best no later than the 1996 rainy season (May to November).&#13;
10.   By mid-1995, IGN has published official and detailed technical specifications for&#13;
all the topographic and cartographic works. The layout of the maps will be the same as&#13;
those already produced by IGN. As per IGN estimates, aerial photographs will need to be&#13;
produced at scale 1:20000 (19200 kn2) for 1:5000 in rural areas and 1:2000 maps-&#13;
production (orthoimages)-and at scale 1:4000 (400 km2) for 1:1000 maps production in&#13;
urban areas. The flight will carry a global positioning system (GPS) on board because it is&#13;
fundamental for at least the small scale (1:20000); it is particularly needed to avoid&#13;
systematic placement of control points to determine field coordinates. The&#13;
aerotriangulation phase is the best way to evaluate the ground control quality and&#13;
therefore the success of the tasks cited in the next four paragraphs.&#13;
11.   For rural areas, orthoimage production would be used to produce raster images,&#13;
but the final production will be made within vector format. IGN will be able to participate&#13;
in this production mainly for the maps at scale 1:2000.&#13;
12.   For urban areas, the stereoplotting production would be used to produce contour&#13;
images. IGN would be able to participate in this production. The difficulty will be to adopt&#13;
a realistic density of details to assure the best identification of the properties and buildings.&#13;
13.   Next, the process to integrate topographic complementary survey data into the&#13;
digital data has to be put in place. Particular attention, control, and coordination must be&#13;
assigned to this task in respect to the time schedule and the quality of the result.&#13;
14.   For map production, IGN needs to develop a typology of expected maps with&#13;
codes for volumes that reflect the de facto situation in objects on parcels on cadastral&#13;
maps, including physical volumes representable in the aerial photography. Altimetry is not&#13;
needed for cadastral purposes. No additional training is needed for this task.&#13;
15.   Mapping Equipment. The project would procure mapping equipment to conform&#13;
a single mapping production unit at IGN. This unit would be sufficient for land records&#13;
maintenance works required after the barrido. This equipment will allow IGN to&#13;
participate efficiently in the project without creating excess capacity for the future (see&#13;
Table 3).&#13;
16.   The recommended equipment consists of (a) stereoscopes and small topographic&#13;
equipment for field identification teams; (b) theodolites and GPS for topographic surveyor&#13;
teams (topographic complementary survey and ground control); (c) a modem laboratory&#13;
to develop the b/w photographs from photogrammetric data; and (d) restitution&#13;
equipment, including one basic system to make orthoimages (raster rectified images for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

rural area) and to introduce the complementary survey results and one analytical&#13;
stereoplotter to produce contour images for urban areas and DTM (digital terrain model).&#13;

17.   The number of the vehicles (50) is calculated and optimized for 115 field&#13;
photoidentification teams and 10 topographic complementary survey teams.&#13;
18.   Land Registry System. The Government is implementing an action plan to&#13;
consolidate the CNR (see Annex BI). An important element is the design of the land&#13;
registry system, and the coding of this system into the automated land information system&#13;
(LIS). This registry system must reflect the documentation flow required by Salvadoran&#13;
legislation and custom. The system must be designed and in place to process the parcel-&#13;
based files that will be generated by the Sonsonate barrido.&#13;
Automated Land Information System&#13;
19.   As explained above, the land information system (LIS) must be designed and&#13;
implemented to receive the files from the Sonsonate barrido under the pilot project. Under&#13;
the proposed national project, the government will adjust the LIS to a national system&#13;
installed in a network constituted by a central office in San Salvador and 3 regional offices,&#13;
with reading access to 52 municipal consultation stations. This network requires a study of&#13;
the appropriate data transfer technology, including cost, security, and training&#13;
considerations.&#13;
20.   Consequently, the national project will be dedicated to the effective generalization&#13;
of procedures as validated through the pilot project. This generalization will also be&#13;
validated at the moment the national project starts up.&#13;
21.   The pilot project ought to&#13;
(a)   define information technology procedures that would assure recording in a&#13;
single file by lot of all topographical and legal information concerning the&#13;
particular lot and would assure their actualization and extraction; and&#13;
(b)   train personnel in the new procedures.&#13;
22.   As defined in the pilot project, the procedures should permit the management of all&#13;
the data for the entire national project. The structure for the information technology will&#13;
represent an unique national configuration; it should permit:&#13;
(a)   file reading&#13;
*     from the information identifying the owner, and&#13;
*     from the topographic data (lot); and&#13;
(b)   use of public terminals to transfer, but not modify, information between&#13;

23.   Combination of Information. After the fieldwork, including the complementary&#13;
survey, the mapping system will contain all the numerical topographical data with the&#13;
boundaries. This digitalized system will be given to the confrontador.&#13;
24.   The confronfador, under this system,&#13;
(a)   attributes a new cadastral number to each lot;&#13;
(b)   opens a corresponding folio real;&#13;
(c)   inscribes the rights concerning the lot, as well as the origin of these rights;&#13;
and&#13;
(d)   creates new digitalized information by combining all the topographical and&#13;
legal information (this step constitutes the provisionalfolio real).&#13;
25.   If necessary, the registrador would modify the provisional folio real or make it&#13;
definitive by validation.&#13;

LAND ADMMIISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
SUMMARY TERM OF REFERENCE FOR MAPPING&#13;
1.    Prior to all phases of project execution described below, the consultant will&#13;
provide a Quality Control Plan. The results will comply with the National Geographic&#13;
Institute norms.&#13;
Aerial Photography&#13;
2.    Standard quality rules for photography shall apply along with recommendations&#13;
that take into account the characteristics of the works to be undertaken in El Salvador.&#13;
Photography will be programmed according to favorable meteorological periods. Flight&#13;
and photography permits should be obtained with the least delay and taking into account&#13;
also any other formalities, including those of bordering countries.&#13;
3.    Two photography takings have been determined in order to minimize field costs,&#13;
obtain maximum profit from the availability of the plane and to permit the most flexibility&#13;
for the works that foliow.&#13;
4.    Scale: 1/20,000 with a 150mm focus and a signal compensation margin. This scale&#13;
will be maintained to cover the entire territory with the exception of the area&#13;
photographed in the Pilot Project. This scale will permit also the restitution in 1/5,000 and&#13;
1/2,000 scales for those complex zones requiring it.&#13;
5.    Photography of urban areas will not be required since they will be affected by a&#13;
1/4,000 coverage. It provides no significant savings and may create '#aps." Small scale&#13;
coverage over the urban centers (for example, San Salvador) can be used for restitution&#13;
for ordering. It would be best suited for defining zones to be included in larger scale.&#13;
6.    Particular care should be taken to define flight plans, taking into account reliefs so&#13;
as not to create major differences in scales and to ensure stereoscopy. In order to&#13;
maximize the trajectory and the number of photographs, flights will be oriented, a priori,&#13;
from East to West. Black and white photographs will be developed, unless an option for&#13;
color photography is included in the contract bid. Color orthoimages must be anticipated.&#13;
Photographs will be realized with an onboard GPS. The consultant will develop the aerial&#13;
photographs in cases offorce majeure to ensure immediate quality control.&#13;
7.   It is estimated that the number of photographs taken will be: of 20,000km2/S.2km2&#13;
by pair, equaling 3,846 pairs. For a safety margin, an additional 20% will be added for a&#13;
total of 4,600 pairs.&#13;
8.   The scale will be 1/4,000 with a focus of 150mm or 300mm for the more&#13;
important locations that require it (building heights, street widths). This scale will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex Dl&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
applied to cover the more important urban zones that will be restituted at a scale of&#13;
1/1,000. Flight plans will depend on the locations and the reliefs founds. Delimitation&#13;
using SPOT images could offer a degree of certainty. These photographs would be black&#13;
and white for later restitution. The onboard GPS will be used and the labwork will be&#13;
undertaken in El Salvador.&#13;
9.    Developed Photographs. The consultant will develop the aerial photographs in El&#13;
Salvador according to specifications and given standards. No enlargements are required&#13;
currently, however, the option for scanning will be available so as to provide quality paper&#13;
prints with the scales required to complete field research. Aerial photography flights shall&#13;
use existing maps of El Salvador (1:50,000 and 1:15,0000). All developed photographs&#13;
shall be deposited with the IGN. El Salvador shall be the sole proprietor of the&#13;
photographs.&#13;
Stereopreparation and Aerial Triangulation&#13;
10.   Stereopreparation of the photographs scaled 1/20,000 will be done using the GPS&#13;
method. Predemarcation is not mandatory since it may delay aerial photography. Precision&#13;
should be compatible with the final products. Each point will be determined with a&#13;
precision of 5 cm in order to guarantee the 1/2,000 scale. The estimated number of points&#13;
is 250. The flight plans will permit a better approximation. The existing geodesic network&#13;
must be analyzed for eventual use of actual points and its integration into the GPS&#13;
network.&#13;
11.   Stereopreparation of the photographs scaled 1/4,000 will be done also using the&#13;
GPS with a precision of 2 cm. Predemarcation is highly recommended. The number of&#13;
points will depend on the flights, with determinations at the ends of each band.&#13;
12.   The results will be in the coordinate system for El Salvador (Lambert, Clarke&#13;
ellipsoidal 1880) that will used in the restitution tasks. At the least, the consultant should&#13;
provide these coordinates in the UTM and WGS systems.&#13;
13.   Leveling will use the current network after a quality analysis of the points&#13;
according to the conventional methods used.&#13;
14.   The preceding tasks will be undertaken in close collaboration with IGN. AU the&#13;
GPS points should be tumuli and will be included in the demarcation fiches according to&#13;
IGN standards. All the observations and calculations will be presented to the CNR. El&#13;
Salvador shall be the sole proprietor.&#13;
15.   Aerial triangulation shall be done in homogenous blocks and according to the&#13;
programming of the restitution works. The results will demonstrate the compensation&#13;
residues that should be compatible with specific data sought in the final documents. This&#13;
control will permit validating the stereopreparation operations. As mentioned earlier, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex Dl&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
results will be provided in the different systems and El Salvador shall be the sole&#13;
proprietor.&#13;
Restitution&#13;
16.   The actual cadastre record shall be maintained according to the entire topographic&#13;
plates. A coding system compatible with the general computing of the national plan should&#13;
be adopted in agreement with the CNR.&#13;
17.   Rural Areas. The scale for rural areas is 1/5,000. For the majority, the scale of&#13;
1/5,000 will be adopted and photographic production will be through orthoimaging (or&#13;
numeric orthophotoplans). Aerial photographs should be scan with a resolution of 25mm&#13;
that would permit having a resolution compatible with scales from 1/5,000 to 1/20,000.&#13;
With these characteristics, isolated details should be identified from 5 to 6 cm off the&#13;
ground. The contrast of the pixels will provide better definition of linear details (streets,&#13;
fencing). In this phase of production, the consultant will provide a first edition scaled to&#13;
1/5,000 for photoidentification. This provisional hard copy could be avoided if good&#13;
coordination permits photoidentification immediately after the production of orthoimages.&#13;
Rectifying orthoimages will be done by individual pixel after the orthoimages are traced in&#13;
the coordinate references for the given projection of the aerial triangulation points. In&#13;
order to achieve this rectification, it will be necessary to know the field numeric model&#13;
with precision compatible with data for curves at an equidistant level of 5 meters. The&#13;
consultant may use existing maps for a large part of the territory. It would be convenient,&#13;
however, verifying the quality of this information beforehand. If there are any doubts, it&#13;
would be convenient to re-form a numeric model by automatic correlation from the new&#13;
aerial coverage. A mosaic of the images will be done automatically.&#13;

digitized entry would be placed inactive if all is completed, otherwise the remainder must&#13;
be actualized. When the area of the property is not included in the recorded document in&#13;
the registry, the analyst must calculate the area of the property according to the&#13;
determined formula. When it is not possible to determine area because of the description&#13;
given of the property, area may not be assigned.&#13;
22.   The enumerated tasks must be realized also during the transition period from the&#13;
old to the new registry.&#13;
23.   Quality control. From  the entries made the supervising registrars and the&#13;
Executing Unit will select randomly records that will be compared with the entries in the&#13;
registry books. If the digitized book contains wrong or missing information, or other error&#13;
or omission that could effect the digitization process, the book will be rejected. The&#13;
contractors will review and correct immediately at their own cost.&#13;
24.   Inputs to be provided by Executing Unit. The Executing unit will provide: (a)&#13;
training for the registry personnel; (b) network computers; (c) data base with the requisite&#13;
information for data entry; and (d) access to the registry offices during the contract period,&#13;
including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.&#13;

Project Administration Component&#13;
1.    This Annex provides details of the project administration component, including&#13;
management of the project activities, projet supervision plan, the procurement plan, and the&#13;
terms of reference for the quality control team.&#13;
Activities to be Financed&#13;
2.    The project administration component (US$7.0 million) would finance the&#13;
project's management, including vehicles and equipment, technical assistance and training,&#13;
and incremental recurrent costs. The project would finance the executing unit (Unidad&#13;
Ejecutora-UE), which was created to manage the pilot program under PRISA. The UE&#13;
is within the CNR, which is managed by a council headed by the Minister of Justice. The UE&#13;
has proven to be extremely effective, but it will need strengthening to take on the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
3.    The UE  would be in charge of managing information campaigns and&#13;
communications, auditing, and project reportingm, including monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
implementation. A monitoring and evaluation system for the project was established under&#13;
PRISA by the end of 1995.&#13;
4.   Because of the national project's complexity, the UE would include a Quality&#13;
Control Team with two main consultants in charge of technical implementation. The&#13;
complexity arises from the need to integrate and unify technical and legal procedures, as&#13;
well as manage dove-tailed operations in different locations and time frames. The quality&#13;
control team would report to the head of the UE and be in charge of following up the&#13;
implementation of project activities by the consultant teams.&#13;
5.    Most of the technical assistance and training to be provided under the project is&#13;
related to skills not available in the government in sufficient depth or quantity.&#13;
International technical assistance (i.e., photogrammetry, land information systems) is to be&#13;
used mainly for developing system design and training local users. Local technical&#13;
assistance refers to skills in ample supply in the private sector (topographers, notaries) to&#13;
carry out outsourced volume services that will not increase the size of the public sector.&#13;
Technical assistance will also backstop ad hoc studies to review project impact and CNR&#13;
effectiveness. Funds would also be available for studies agreed with the Bank, translating&#13;
the SAR and other project documents, for project evaluations and auditing, as well as&#13;
preparing other documentation relevant to the project.&#13;
&#13;

Activities to be Managed&#13;
6.    Activities to be managed:&#13;
(a)    Once the Sonsonate pilot phase is finished and the basic data is obtained, it&#13;
will be necessary to formulate modifications in the legal framework that&#13;
will be the basis for modernization throughtout the country. This&#13;
framework will be analyzed in terms of the applicable norms that may be&#13;
found in the pilot phase and the recommendations from the experts&#13;
redesigning the registry system software (LIS).&#13;
(b)    Subsequently, it will be necessary to contract firm for aerial photography&#13;
for the entire country in accordance with the procedures and scales&#13;
determined through the Sonsonate Pilot Project. These firms will enlarge&#13;
and restore the aerial photographs and eventually, the country will be&#13;
provided with the restoration equipment necessary for maintaining the&#13;
registry system nationwide.&#13;
(c)   Once the aerial photographs are enlarged, local firms will photoidentify&#13;
lots. These firms will also conduct the corresponding searches for the rights&#13;
that the titleholders may possess. They will be also responsible for hiring&#13;
notaries for alternative conflict resolution and will report to the Justices of&#13;
the Peace or other judges those conflicts that cannot be resolved&#13;
administratively. Two teams would work simultaneously in order to&#13;
complete these activities in the a reasonable amount of time. According&#13;
the estimates, the firms shouls have at least 112 photoidentifiers at work&#13;
through both phases of the project. An equal number of students will work&#13;
along with them as well as 15 notaries at each base operation city.&#13;
(d)   Each one of the firms will coordinate its activities with a legal firm that will&#13;
undertake the registry studies according to the specific Department in&#13;
which modernization is taking place.&#13;
(e)   Finally, the legal, graphic and field analyses will be placed in a single&#13;
document to as to fulfill the transfers from the old to the new registry&#13;
system.&#13;
(f)    When the preceeding have been accomplished, the old registry offices and&#13;
the National Geographic Institute offices will become either regional or&#13;
municipal offices in those Departments. There will be four departmental&#13;
offices for the new Registry and Cadastre System. Subsequently, there will&#13;
be 52 presentation and consulting tables.&#13;

Phasing of the regularization activities&#13;
7.    The first phase groups two zones (see map in Annex Al). The first zone consists&#13;
of the La Libertad, San Salvador and Cuscatlan Departments. The Registry Office (First&#13;
Section of the Center located in San Salvador) furnished registry services for the&#13;
Departments of San Salvador and Cuscatlan. The Departments of San Salvador and La&#13;
Libertad contain the highest urban populations for which they are known as 'Greater San&#13;
Salvador." This would define with greater precision those aspects related to municipal&#13;
limits. The execution of this phase will begin in mid-1996 and completed in at the&#13;
beginning of the year 2000.&#13;
8.    The first phase also includes the Western Zone, consisting of the Santa Ana,&#13;
Chalatenango, Ahuachapan and Sonsonate Departments. The first two are undergoing&#13;
delimitation with Honduras. The execution of the first phase for these departments will&#13;
begin in mid-1996 and be completed at the end of 1999.&#13;
9.    The second phase also consists of two zones. The first zone comprises the San&#13;
Miguel, Morazan and La Uni6n Departments. The Registry Office (First Western Section&#13;
located in San Miguel City) provides registry services for all three departments, which will&#13;
facilitate recompiling primary registry data. Two of the Departments are undergoing also&#13;
delimitation with Honduras. The execution of this phase will begin in early 1998 and be&#13;
completed in early 2001.&#13;
10.   The second phase also includes the Eastern Zone. It consists of the La Paz,&#13;
Usulutan, Cabafias and San Vicente Departments. The Registry Office (Second Section&#13;
located in San Vicente City) provides services to the latter two. The execution of this&#13;
phase will begin in mid- 1999 and be completed at the end of the year 2000.&#13;

SUMMARY TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR QUALITY CONTROL TEAM&#13;
1    Under the guidance of the executing unit (UE), the quality control team will&#13;
supervise the execution of the regularization (establishing the folio real, conducting&#13;
fieldwork, and integrating the records into the LIS). The team is needed because of the&#13;
complexity of integrating and unifying technical and legal procedures and managing&#13;
dovetailed operations in different locations and time frames. All these tasks will be&#13;
implemented by consultant teams. The quality control team would report to the head of&#13;

Procurement Plan&#13;
I .    According to the time schedule of the project, the preparation of the tenders has to&#13;
begin at the end of 1995, at least seven months before the start of the proposed land&#13;
administration project (estimated to begin in June 1996). Based on this timetable, the&#13;
procurement plan includes the following key tenders:&#13;
(a)   Mapping for El Salvador, including aerial photography, ground control,&#13;
aerotriangulation, restitution (scales are 1:1000, 1:2000, 1:5000), and&#13;
topographic complementary survey. The first phase is the writing of the&#13;
mapping tenders documents. (see Annex DI).&#13;
(b)   Legal research (levantamiento) operations, field photoidentification, and&#13;
merging for the first phase covering he West Zone (Santa Ana,&#13;
Chalatenengo, Ahuachapan) and the Central Zone (San Salvador, la&#13;
Libertad, Cuscatlan). The tender for the second phase-the Northem-&#13;
Central Zone (Usulutan, la Paz, San Vincente, Cabanas) and the East Zone&#13;
(San Miguel, La Union, Morazan)-will be launched seven months before&#13;
the starting of the second phase on October 1, 1998 (International&#13;
Competition Bidding-ICB) (see Annexes D2 and D3).&#13;
(c)   Extension and adjustment of the land information system (LIS) software. If&#13;
this step is necessary, it could be launched as soon as the design made&#13;
during the pilot phase is ready and accepted. To ensure the best integration,&#13;
the tender could include the hardwaie (ICB).&#13;
(d)   Technical equipment. Separate tenders or one or two tenders f-ir different&#13;
equipment types will be necessary. Because there is not a sole supplier for&#13;
all of the required equipment, a single tender would be inorG *.sqpensive but&#13;
easier to handle administratively (ICB). The equipment needed ir.cludes&#13;
(i)   total stations, small topographic equipment, including stereoscopes;&#13;
(ii)    GPS and accessories and computer for calculations;&#13;
(iii)   analytical stereoplotter with power supply unit;&#13;
(iv)    orthoimages production equipment with power supply unit; and&#13;
(v)   laboratory equipment for aerial photographs with power supply&#13;
unit.&#13;

SUMMARY OF DESIGN ALTERNATmES CONSIDERED&#13;
Design Issues&#13;
I.    Topographic Surveys, Aerial Photography and GPS.  The topographic&#13;
alternative was the first considered given the lack mastery of other technologies in the&#13;
country, but discarded because it was too expensive and cumbersome.  GPS-only&#13;
technology is very exact but very expensive and labor intensive (about 10 minutes per&#13;
point). Also, GPS accuracy is random because of some satellites' jamming, so it requires&#13;
considerable adjustments.  The chosen technology combines all three technologies&#13;
complimentarily: GPS capability, mounted on the plane and aerial photography to create&#13;
digital maps and topographic surveys to complement as needed to cloud or other cover.&#13;
2.    Why Orthophotomaps only in the Rural Areas? Orthophotomaps are images&#13;
from digitalized data. They are accurate on a plane but do not capture images well in the&#13;
presence of heights (for example, tall buildings). For this reason the digital data needs&#13;
stereoplotting to produce urban cadastral maps (to capture information hidden by shadows&#13;
created by high buildings).&#13;
Cost Minimization Alternatives: Some Design Elements from the Pilot's&#13;
Experimental Phase&#13;
3.    Registry Investigation and Analysis. The initial pilot project design included&#13;
photocopying all the registry books so that the work to establish initial folio reales could&#13;
be contracted out. Given the expense and the lack of notaries familiar with folio reales to&#13;
establish the new folio reales database, it was decided to hire Registry staff to input the&#13;
data directly. Registry staff are more familiar with folio reales because some goverment&#13;
programs (that is, San Salvador Registry, FINATA) use them. This allowed the registry&#13;
volumes to be kept in the Registry to ensure their continued availability to the public as&#13;
well as on-the-job training for data input clerks in the new automated system. This&#13;
solution increased staff ownership, saved the expense of photocopying and accelerated&#13;
implementation by about four months (contracting and training a different team).&#13;
4.    Field Verification Teams. Initially, teams were to be composed of an IGN&#13;
photoidentifier with a notary. But notaries were not willing to participate in the field work&#13;
for the salary offered. Therefore it was decided to place one notary per municipality for&#13;
document formulation and use fourth year Law students to review the property documents&#13;
in the field. This allowed to focus the role of notaries in non-judicial dispute resolution&#13;
(mainly mediation) and establishing documents, and reduced the cost of the field document&#13;
review.&#13;

EL SALVADOR&#13;
LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT REPORTING, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION&#13;
1.    To  support the Government's management of implementation  and  the&#13;
establishment of a monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system to enable this, the project&#13;
finances necessary personnel, equipment, and training under the project administration&#13;
component to: (a) generate and disseminate information as a management tool and to&#13;
streamline administrative procedures; (b) track indicators to guide adjustments during&#13;
implementation; and (c) evaluate success relative to defined objectives and criteria.&#13;
Indicators are listed in Annexes GI-G4. A project implementation timetable for the&#13;
national project by year has already been prepared by the government (Annex B2),&#13;
Because the importance for project administration, the project supervision milestone for&#13;
critical activities is outlined in Annex E2. The Procurement Plan is in Annex E3. The&#13;
Disbursement Schedule is in Annex F, page 10.&#13;
2.    Monitoring and Evaluation. This phase of the project would be the responsibility&#13;
of the CNR and will be carried out by the Executing Unit (UJE), supported by a Quality&#13;
Control Team that consists of three principal consultants. This team would report directly&#13;
to the head of the UE and be in charge of quality control, so the system would provide&#13;
project management with monitoring and evaluating data for activities carried out by the&#13;
local consultant teams. The UE would complete the design of the management&#13;
information system (MS) to generate, among others, the draft indicators in Annexes GI&#13;
to G4 and based on terms of reference in G5 (see also SAR, para. 4.18.). The MIS would&#13;
enable the UE to track implementation (inputs and outputs), impact and legal indicators.&#13;
3.    Reporting. Quarterly reports based on project implementation planning would be&#13;
prepared by the UE. The quarterly reports would provide evaluations of implementation&#13;
progress and impact. This information would enable the UE to adjust activities, if&#13;
necessary, in agreement with the Bank. These reports would be summarize and submitted&#13;
to the Bank 30 days before the annual reviews. Each review would take place about&#13;
September 30 of each year. Bank supervision would review implementation progress and&#13;
proposed budget and work plans for the following year.&#13;
4.    Each quarterly report would be composed of completed tables on:&#13;
(a)   implementation indicators:&#13;
(i)     inputs&#13;
a. financial    i.    revenues and expenses&#13;
ii.   budget execution (standard format)&#13;
uii.  loan disbursements (standard format)&#13;
b. and physical;&#13;
(ii)   outputs (physical);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
(b)   impact indicators; and&#13;
(c)   status of legal covenants.&#13;
5.    Project supervision input would be based on the MIS's M&amp;E   indicators&#13;
established under the project. These indicators would be agreed upon during negotiations.&#13;
6.    Independent Studies.   Project management will carry out periodic and&#13;
independent studies to both monitor implementation and impact and visit an specific&#13;
aspect of the project. These studies include the studies to establish the baseline field&#13;
survey for the establishment of the impact indicators (see TORs in Annex G5) and the&#13;
periodic client evaluations and surveys to report on these. The studies also include&#13;
independent studies to review tariffs (see TORs in Annex B6), evaluation of effectiveness&#13;
of administrative decentralization and role of municipalities, prospective property&#13;
valuation system, property rights and farm productivity and others to be agreed with the&#13;
Bank.&#13;

LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE IMACT INDICATORS BASELINE FIELD SURVEY&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Land Administration Project seeks to increase land tenure security in El&#13;
Salvador to improve the access to credit of previously untitled land owners. By improving&#13;
access to credit, the land regularization is expected to increase investment, which-in&#13;
turn-is expected to increase farm income by increasing productivity and creating a wider&#13;
range of production opportunities. Similarly, strengthened land tenure and access to credit&#13;
are expected to impact positively on land management.&#13;
2.    To obtain quantifiable data for measuring the impact of the proposed project on&#13;
credit, investment, and land management, a baseline field survey is required prior to&#13;
project implementation. The baseline for Sonsonate will provide valuable input for&#13;
comparison purposes for other departments.&#13;
Objective&#13;
3.    The objective of the field survey is to collect primary data of the situation of&#13;
intended project beneficiaries prior to project implementation. This data will serve as a&#13;
point of comparison with follow-up surveys to be taken at Mid-Term and completion of&#13;
the proposed project. This comparison will permit a quantification of the plan's impact on&#13;
farm income, investment decisions, and land management techniques.&#13;
4.    Specific information required from the survey includes the following:&#13;
* Access to credit, increased number of mortgages given to newly regularized&#13;
properties&#13;
* Investment: type of investment, including for income diversification, land&#13;
improvements and management.&#13;
5.    Baseline information is to be collected from a selected sample of farms in the&#13;
Sonsonate Department. The sample will be divided into three size categories: micro (less&#13;
than 3 hectares), small (3-10 hectares), and medium to large (more than 10 hectares). Half&#13;
of the sample will be made up of farms with land title and half will be without land title.&#13;
Sonsonate will be used as the area of study because in that department, by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G5&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
project's completion year (2002), sufficient time will have elapsed for the modernization&#13;
process to produce measurable results.&#13;
Activities&#13;
6.    Assembling a Field Survey Team. The survey team will consist of a field&#13;
supervisor/coordinator and four field surveyors. Team members should be from the&#13;
Sonsonate area, and they should have an agricultural background and a strong knowledge&#13;
of crop and livestock production parameters. Surveyors should be very personable and&#13;
should be able to work independently. Women surveyors are strongly recommended.&#13;
7.    Training a Survey Team in Field Survey Techniques. The survey team will&#13;
probably require specific training (2-3 days) in field survey techniques. Team members&#13;
must understand how to properly solicit information without distorting the respondents'&#13;
answers. Also, they must learn the inviolate nature of the information that is collected (no&#13;
changes should be made to the recorded answers). The quality of the survey process is&#13;
enhanced when the surveyors understand how the information they are collecting will be&#13;
used; this process should be carefully explained to them.&#13;
8.    Finalizing a Field Survey. Review and prepare a version of the field survey&#13;
questionnaire for testing purposes. Undertake field testing of questionnaire with at least 20&#13;
questionnaires (four per surveyor and the coordinator). Finalize the field survey based on&#13;
the results of the testing.&#13;
9.    Preparing the Data Entry Module. Prepare the data collection module in a way&#13;
that reflects as closely as possible the visual presentation of the field survey (this practice&#13;
facilitates data entry and reduces entry error).&#13;
10.   Selecting a Sample and Planning the Survey Route.&#13;
(a)   Select the communities within Sonsonate for surveying. As a start, we&#13;
proposed Santo Domingo Guzman and Santa Catarina Mazahuat because&#13;
field work has already been carried out there.&#13;
(b)   Select sample. From regularized properties, stratification required is 50 of&#13;
each urban &gt;500 m, urban &lt;500 m, rural &gt; 3 ha and rural &lt; 3 ha.&#13;
Information from registry sources and local extentionists will help identify&#13;
initial lists of target farms or contacts in target communities.&#13;
(c)   Plan the survey route.&#13;
11.   Undertaking the Survey. Conduct the survey based on the route plan. The goal&#13;
should be an average of five questionnaires per surveyor per day. The field coordinator is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G5&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
responsible for ensuring the integrity of data collected, including periodic revision during&#13;
the day, and a compiete review of all questionnaires at the end of the day. Prior to each&#13;
day's survey activities, the coordinator will review problems and questions that the survey&#13;
team may have about the previous day's activities. The coordinator will also discuss and&#13;
correct methodological discrepancies and/or deviations that may develop.&#13;
12.   Entering Data and Cleansing and Preparing Summary Tables. Data will be&#13;
entered into the data collection module. This transfer should be done at least once a week.&#13;
Data entry will be performed by members of the field survey team. This practice will&#13;
maintain continuity between data collection and data entry and will help ensure the&#13;
integrity of the data collected.&#13;
13.   Data cleansing will be performed by using the SPSS data cleansing routine. Data&#13;
cleansing will also be carried out through the preparation and analysis of summary tables.&#13;
Expected Product&#13;
14.   A total of 200 field surveys will be collected from Sonsonate, from farms with the&#13;
following characteristics:&#13;
PROPERTY SIZE          UNTITLED&#13;
urban &gt; 500m                50&#13;
urban c 500 m               50&#13;
rural &gt; 3 ha                50&#13;
rural&lt;3ha                    50&#13;
Note: Original surveys and a diskette with data file will be provided.&#13;
Duration&#13;
15.   Time frame for the survey is six weeks, including three weeks of fieldwork.&#13;
Dependency&#13;
16.   The major responsibility for carrying out the survey will be in the hands of the&#13;
executing unit.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Land Administration Project has the
            following objectives: 1) to regularize land registration for
            El Salvador's estimated 1.6 million parcels of rural
            and urban land; and 2) to create an efficient, streamlined,
            and financially self-sustaining nationwide cadastral
            mechanism for mapping and land registration - the new
            National Registry Center. Land registration will provide
            land owners - particularly the vast majority of smallholders
            who lack clear tenure - with the security that will enable
            them to sell or rent at fair market prices, and pass on
            their holdings as inheritances. Improving tenure security
            will also increase smallholder access to credit, raising
            incentives to invest and to manage land properly. The
            project has two major components: 1) institutional
            strengthening and decentralization; and 2) land data
            acquisition, which includes three subcomponents: (a)
            mapping; (b) land records regularization; and (c) alternate
            dispute resolution mechanisms.
