Abdala and      Recent power outages in Argentina are largely the result of transmission problems that could be&#13;
Andres          solved by more investment. Private concessionaires now operate the main and regional&#13;
Chambouleyron&#13;
                networks, but they are under no obligation to expand capacity. In a decentralized electricity&#13;
&#13;
                market such as Argentina's the key to a successful transmission investment policy is&#13;
&#13;
                coordination among the parties involved. Without coordination, an investment project in one&#13;
&#13;
                site might affect or even disrupt power flow in another. But user coalitions are difficult to set up&#13;
&#13;
                because of high transaction costs (mainly informational) and, in the Argentine system, because&#13;
&#13;
                investment mechanisms do not provide a clear allocation of property rights to private investors.&#13;
&#13;
                Investment decisionmaking for capacity expansion is centralized, but prolonged congestion&#13;
&#13;
                indicates that the process is not working efficiently. Argentina is searching for a decentralized&#13;
&#13;
                solution. This Note outlines the options for its high-voltage network and proposes a solution for&#13;

clear advantages: it is highly decentralized, min-&#13;

    between generation and demand sites, controlling load patterns,&#13;
    supplying emergency and security responses, coordinating main-&#13;
    tenance, and managing operating reserves. All these should be&#13;
    seen as services provided by the transmission company. The main&#13;
    difficulty, for both the firm and the regulator, lies in pricing these&#13;
    services, as costing them out is arduous.&#13;

            Transmission investment in competitive
            power systems : decentralizing decisions in Argentina
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Recent power outages in Argentina are
            largely the result of transmission problems that could be
            solved by more investment. Private concessionaires now
            operate the main and regional networks, but they are under
            no obligation to expand capacity. In a decentralized
            electricity market such as Argentina's the key to a
            successful transmission investment policy is coordination
            among the parties involved. Without coordination, an
            investment project in one site might affect or even disrupt
            power flow in another. But user coalitions are difficult to
            set up because of high transaction costs and in the
            Argentine system, because investment mechanisms do not
            provide a clear allocation of property rights to private
            investors. Investment decision making for capacity expansion
            is centralized, but prolonged congestion indicates that the
            process is not working efficiently. Argentina is searching
            for a decentralized solution. This note outlines the options
            for its high-voltage network and proposes a solution for the
            regional grids.
