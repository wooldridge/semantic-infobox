            Entrepreneurship is important for the
            continued dynamism of modern economies and for job creation.
            Policymakers need to know how new firms get started and what
            financial and institutional factors promote entrepreneurial
            activity. A new cross-country, time-series data set shows a
            strong correlation between entrepreneurship and the quality
            of the legal and regulatory environment, ease of access to
            finance, and prevalence of informality. This finding tells
            policymakers what they can do to promote entrepreneurship.
