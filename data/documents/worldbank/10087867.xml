1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The Domestic Private Sector Participation (DPSP) Initiative is a DFID-funded program that is being&#13;
  implemented by the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) to unlock the potential of domestic private&#13;
  providers and finance in the delivery of water and sanitation services to the poor. It is intended to&#13;
  implement the program globally, through the WSP regional programs.&#13;
&#13;
   This workshop report summarizes the proceedings and outputs of a Global Practitioners' Workshop&#13;
   for the DPSP Initiative held in Nairobi June 20-21, 2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Objectives of the Global Practitioners' Workshop&#13;
&#13;
   The objective of the Global Practitioners' Workshop was to provide a platform for experts to:&#13;
· Review existing knowledge and experience&#13;
· Define gaps and identify key issues on which the DPSP Initiative should focus&#13;
· Help identify collaborators, partners and clients to take the work forward&#13;
· Influence the scope and content of project activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Structure of Workshop&#13;
&#13;
   The two-day workshop was structured into plenary sessions and breakout streams. Roving reporters&#13;
   were selected to exchange information and provide ongoing feedback between the streams.&#13;

2. OVERVIEW OF THE DPSP INITIATIVE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  By Janelle Plummer&#13;
&#13;
  The objective of the DPSP Initiative is to support activities that work towards increasing sustained&#13;
  access to improved water and sanitation services for poor people. The purpose is to support client&#13;
  countries and multi-lateral initiatives to leverage greater financial and technical inputs from the&#13;
  domestic private sector. The focus will be on finding ways to unlock the potential of the water market&#13;
  and to mobilize market-based finance within the sector. Based on analysis of the hurdles, there are&#13;
  two primary areas of action required to unlock the market:&#13;
· Developing the capacity of the supply and demand of the market&#13;
· Promoting an effective enabling environment for domestic private operators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The objective of the DPSP Initiative is to focus on a range of domestic opportunities and constraints&#13;
  within this framework:&#13;
· Enhancing the policy and regulatory environment&#13;
· Unlocking access to domestic finance&#13;
· Enhancing the capacity of oversight and regulatory institutions&#13;
· Developing appropriate monitoring mechanisms&#13;
· Providing capacity building to small and medium private providers through the development of&#13;
   supporting programs&#13;
· Building public awareness of the potential roles of the domestic private sector&#13;
· Facilitating relationships between small-scale private operators and utilities, municipalities and&#13;
  communities&#13;
· Promoting accountability that will enable a more effective and competitive local private sector which is&#13;
  willing and able to provide services to poor people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The DPSP Initiative is designed to enable WSP, with its government and non-government partners, to&#13;
   provide strategic assistance to partner countries and unlock the potential of the domestic private&#13;
   sector. This, in turn, should facilitate a significant global and cross-regional learning program in DPSP&#13;
   and, simultaneously, enhance coordination among donor, multilateral, non-governmental organization&#13;
   (NGO) and CSO programs in the development of DPSP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Proposed Project Scope and Content&#13;
   Participants agreed on working definitions for DPSP:&#13;
· Private includes profit-making organizations and individuals, in both the formal and informal sectors,&#13;
  that conduct operations on a commercial basis. The definition also covers providers such as&#13;
  cooperatives and NGOs that are regarded as commercial in the sense that they look to recover their&#13;
  costs but do not necessarily aim to generate a commercial rate of return&#13;
· Domestic includes organizations and individuals that function within the scope of a national, provincial&#13;
   or local capacity&#13;
· Water and sanitation includes water supply and sanitation services (networked or non-networked),&#13;
  and hygiene promotion. The framework is potentially inclusive of all habitats, whether urban or rural&#13;
  areas, and including small towns and settlements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Figure 1 illustrates the project content. The structure covers two primary themes:&#13;
· To create an enabling environment that is supportive of local private sector activity&#13;
· To enhance the marketplace through building capacity of the supply and demand sides.&#13;

The Process to Date&#13;
The initial project overview provided a description of the project planning process to date (shown in&#13;
Figure 2). Efforts have to date concentrated on how and which countries the DPSP objectives can be&#13;
integrated with WSP country work plans. A set of outline proposals has been developed and&#13;
analyzed in terms of the overall objectives and deliverables of the DFID proposal. At the same time&#13;
the thematic areas have been articulated in greater detail, and will be further developed through the&#13;
outcomes of the Global Practitioners' workshop.&#13;

3. WORKSHOP STREAMS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   STREAM 1 ­ Local Private Sector Providers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   State of Play&#13;
   The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for water and sanitation aim to reduce by half the&#13;
   number of households without access to adequate water supply and sanitation services. While&#13;
   approaches to support utilities and municipalities for developing water and sanitation networks and&#13;
   services in formal settlements are well known, informal settlements continue to pose a challenge. If&#13;
   utilities cannot provide the investment required to address the needs of informal settlements to reach&#13;
   the MDG, they will continue to get water and sanitation services through informal Domestic Private&#13;
   Service Providers operating in a policy constrained environment. A few case studies illustrate this:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   a) A case study on DPSP in sanitation points out that cesspool emptying operators in large African&#13;
         cities play a central role even when municipalities are reluctant and exit the market. Households&#13;
         rely on these private operators (trucks in this case) to remove sludge from the on-site sanitation&#13;
         facilities. There is good reason to believe that public investment should be dedicated to building&#13;
         adequate dumping sites (which remain the major bottleneck for this segment of the sanitation&#13;
         market) in the immediate future. Municipalities could address issues such as allocation of public&#13;
         land for disposal, tariff-setting mechanisms, regulation and law enforcement, and the DPSP&#13;
         Initiative could play an increasing role in mobilizing finances and service provision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   b) A case study in Maputo reveals that DPSP providers are expanding into areas where the utilities&#13;
         supply water at low pressures and ground water is available. About 200 systems managed by&#13;
         100 small scale providers serve about 200,000 people in the peri-urban areas through 280 stand-&#13;
         pipes and 5,500 domestic connections. It has been observed that whenever the water supply from&#13;
         a formal company is insufficient and groundwater is available, local private water suppliers are in&#13;
         a position to develop the service and invest in complete water systems, including small networks&#13;
         linked to boreholes and storage tanks. However, there is no legal framework or official recognition&#13;
         of the work by small scale providers. They also lack access to formal sector finances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   c) Groundwater is available in many cities. This has enabled, DPSP investment, for example, in&#13;
         Sanaa in Yemen, Asuncion in Paraguay, Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, Port-au-Prince in Haiti,&#13;
         Jakarta in Indonesia, Burao in Somaliland, Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Kathmandu in Nepal.&#13;
         Some cases where the DPSP have not invested can be explained by the lack of groundwater (for&#13;
         example in Bamako, Ouagadougou, Niamey, Nouakchott) or adequate bulk water provided by the&#13;
         main utility (such as in Abidjan).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   d) In Santa Cruz, Bolivia, Aguas del Este S.A. is the first domestic private provider. Some key&#13;
         challenges faced in service delivery are: gaps in the legal framework, service provision in low&#13;
         density settlements, lack of soft loans and constraints posed by social and political risks.&#13;
         Customers are charged different tariffs based on income bracket, but scaling-up within the current&#13;
         policy framework remains an obstacle.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   e) Private water operators in small towns in Uganda manage water supply systems under contracts&#13;
         with town water authorities. The services of the water providers have been expanding since 2001&#13;
         but constraints in the contractual arrangement (three year contracts only) and inability to invest&#13;
         directly in expanding the system are limiting the operations of these private providers as efficient&#13;
         business entities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                       Workshop Report DPSP Initiative Nairobi June 20-21, 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Constraints&#13;
The challenge is to help DPSPs to move from informal, illegal, low standard service provision to&#13;
recognized and regularized water and sanitation service providers. While the DPSPs have&#13;
demonstrated all necessary skills to scale-up and provide good quality water and suitable sanitation&#13;
services, they are unlikely to invest because their businesses are vulnerable to risks from&#13;
expropriation, insecure land tenure, and access to finance. Some of the key constraints that limit&#13;
DPSP contribution in improving service provision to the poor are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Associations or cartels: Hostile environments and dispersed operations of a large number of&#13;
   DPSPs make associations a necessity. This poses the risk of the emergence of cartels, which are&#13;
   known to obstruct regulation, create barriers to entry, limit competition, and exploit consumers.&#13;
   There is a need to improve transparency in associations by introducing mechanisms for boosting&#13;
   consumer voice mechanisms, such as report cards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Formal versus informal: Why do DPSPs prefer to operate in the informal sector and what&#13;
   incentives would encourage DPSPs to establish formal enterprises and integrate investments with&#13;
   formal urban service providers? Costs associated with entry into the formal sector can discourage&#13;
   the transition. In addition, if DPSP providers become formal, the change does not directly&#13;
   translate into better access to funds, recognition by the utility or enhanced stability in their&#13;
   business.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Financial constraints: An issue was raised whether, DPSP can finance infrastructure in illegal&#13;
   settlements in the long-term. Also why do formal banks stay out of this growing business and&#13;
   how can public money be injected into water and sanitation systems managed by DPSP&#13;
   providers? Lack of public finance to support the provision of public facilities such as dumping sites&#13;
   and septic tanks also poses a challenge. Additionally there is a need to explore the role of the&#13;
   private sector in investment to enhance treatment capacity, supply network and sanitation&#13;
   facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Responses&#13;
Potential solutions to ease institutional, financial and other constraints in the provision of water and&#13;
sanitation services through DPSP are illustrated through the following successful experiences:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Policy framework and contracts that worked&#13;
   a.    A large municipality in Vietnam created a very simple legal environment to encourage private&#13;
        sector participation in water supply. An example is Ho Chi Minh City which has highlighted&#13;
        the need for local private investment in a growing city and demonstrates the capacity and&#13;
        willingness of DPSP to invest. The case identifies the advantages and limits of legal&#13;
        arrangements such as simple licenses that can develop into lease contracts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   b. A national policy in Uganda that sets rules for DPSPs to run systems in small towns through&#13;
        management contracts demonstrates the potential as well as the limitations of this approach.&#13;
        At present this arrangement covers 41 out of 59 small towns, with few house connections (2&#13;
        household connections per 100 inhabitants), and incomplete operation and management cost&#13;
        recovery. Although there is a comprehensive regulatory framework, designed especially for&#13;
        the management of small towns, excessive control, unrealistically low tariffs and large public&#13;
        investment has curtailed the capacity of the private sector to innovate, invest and develop the&#13;
        services. As a next step, the aggregation of small towns may constitute the basis for&#13;
        sustaining sound businesses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    c. In Mauritania, a sound national policy framework has opened the door for the local private&#13;
        sector to develop systems. This has resulted in increased coverage (20 house connections&#13;
        per 100 inhabitants), full operation and maintenance, cost recovery and improvement in the&#13;
        level of service. The DPSPs' have succeeded in extending coverage and making money in&#13;
        what were known as unprofitable small towns. In this case the lack of regulation in the past&#13;
        has not hampered DPSP engagement. Other success factors include strong social&#13;
        interaction with communities and provision of a few alternate job opportunities in small towns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    d. In Somaliland, DPSP has demonstrated capacity to restore power and water services in a&#13;
        post-war environment. The main clauses in the contract between the municipalities and local&#13;
        water providers create incentives to increase the coverage, clarify the tariff setting&#13;
        mechanism, and encourage pro-poor arrangements. The informal arrangements between&#13;
        various clans to share ownership of the water company have been unique to Somaliland,&#13;
        raising concerns about limiting competition under monopoly concessions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    DPSP providers collaborate with large utilities for bulk supply:&#13;
    a. In Kenya, practical actions have been taken to formalize independent water kiosk operators&#13;
        serving poor households in a large urban settlement in Nairobi. The establishment of an&#13;
        association has enabled a large group of water operators to work together to improve their&#13;
        credibility, start a process of regulating their own services and begin developing the process&#13;
        of productive dialogue with the utility. In other East African cities (Kampala and Dar es&#13;
        Salaam), innovative arrangements for bulk supply between the utility and DPSP have resulted&#13;
        in improved services to informal settlements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    b. In Haiti, bulk water supply by the utility through DPSP (NGOs, community-based&#13;
        organizations and small scale private providers) at the edge of an informal settlement is being&#13;
        bulk metered. In addition the utility is providing technical support to the DPSP providers for&#13;
        works within the informal settlements. The utility has set a bulk water price lower than `the&#13;
        social tariff', but higher than mean cost of production, thus serving the consumers in poor&#13;
        settlements with water at a low price but without incurring losses. There is still room to&#13;
        improve the level of regulation within the informal settlements where the tariff is poorly&#13;
        regulated and there is lack of financial transparency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Developing partnership between private sector, civil society and government.&#13;
    The challenge of developing partnership begins with how champions who support Public Private&#13;
    Partnerships (PPP) within the utility, local government or the professional association of DPSP&#13;
    are identified and how their positions are consolidated within their institutions. It also raises&#13;
    questions around effectiveness of formal contracts and whether they are necessary for&#13;
    partnerships. Finally the question that is central to enhancing accountability towards the end&#13;
    consumer rests on how civil society (voters in general and consumers in particular) consolidate&#13;
    and legitimatize their participation and influence regulatory mechanisms. Successful examples of&#13;
    how accountability has been introduced through tools such as consumer report cards were&#13;
    discussed in Stream Two on consumer voice and client power.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Action areas&#13;
The following action areas were identified as the key focus areas for expanding improved service&#13;
delivery by unlocking the potential of the DPSP.&#13;
    Scaling up with bulk supply: Bulk supply is a viable option although there are a few pre-&#13;
    conditions such as the availability of, and demand for utility water plus economic viability. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                    Workshop Report DPSP Initiative Nairobi June 20-21, 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
requires recognition by the utility that DPSP can rapidly reduce water losses and increase&#13;
revenue collection. Once bulk supply is established there is a need to develop mechanisms for&#13;
distribution that are often facilitated by associations as in the case of Kibera in Nairobi, Port-au-&#13;
Prince or Maputo. Other options include the use of local consultancy firms that specialize in&#13;
working within informal settlements as in the case of South Africa, where consumer awareness&#13;
and management is a central issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The role of DPSP is to develop sub-networks with in-house capacity to manage new yard tap and&#13;
household connections, meters, billing and to share other operational and management risks&#13;
(with the utility) when supplying consumers within informal settlements. Although development of&#13;
sub-networks linked to bulk supply is a viable option, there is a need to determine the optimal size&#13;
of such networks, detailed network designs, management arrangements and communication&#13;
strategies to enhance demand for improved services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In some cases, local private firms may also play a central role in buying bulk water from the utility&#13;
at negotiated rates for supply in large informal settlements. Through umbrella contracts, a local&#13;
private firm could develop services to low income settlements making access to finance easier.&#13;
This may take the form of a management contract to a local provider with options for&#13;
diversification (to distribute risk and reduce cost) in the provision of a range of services such as&#13;
phones, sanitation services and supply of electricity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bulk supply linked to sub-networks developed and managed by DPSP requires the utility to have&#13;
strategies in place that address network intensification and rationalization of water connections in&#13;
informal settlements. The strategies also need to include creation of social connections for yard&#13;
taps and kiosks (targeted subsidies to the poorest neighborhoods) and establishment of pro-poor&#13;
units and life line tariffs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Simple contracts enhance efficiency of DPSP. Existing contracts depend on the local&#13;
institutional approach and policy framework. In Uganda the contract is too complex and the&#13;
management contract is used as a service contract, while in Maputo there is no contract. In&#13;
Bolivia the arrangement encourages the DPSP providers to build, operate and own, while in&#13;
Mauritania the contract is weak at the beginning yet successful in attracting substantial investment&#13;
from DPSP. Despite weak public institutions DPSP have entered into concessions in Somaliland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Similarly for small towns there are a wide range of contractual arrangements. The most common&#13;
types involve the DPSP providers managing existing systems and, at times, investing in service&#13;
expansion. The lease contract arrangement offers flexibility. Another important factor for&#13;
consideration is clustering to introduce economies of scale as in Niger. Negotiation is a key&#13;
element to successful contracts. Once performance-based contracts between the local&#13;
authority/utility and the DPSP providers are negotiated and signed, the government should play&#13;
the role of a watchdog that monitors performance, even if measurement is not easy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In informal settlements where contracts for bulk supply between the utility and DPSP are&#13;
established, agreement on quality and quantity at the distribution point should be specified. This is&#13;
because it is often difficult to regulate beyond the bulk supply point such as water tankers in&#13;
Ghana. It is essential to avoid monopoly on distribution as competition is the best regulator. In&#13;
addition public awareness is handy because the consumer is able to play a role in regulating the&#13;
price if the bulk supply price is advertised.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                          Workshop Report DPSP Initiative Nairobi June 20-21, 2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Specifying quantity and quality parameters are helpful when a private system is financed with&#13;
    private funds in a concession contract. It is possible to improve quality through the formation of&#13;
    an association that establishes rules for self regulation. In addition, DPSP should be regulated by&#13;
    the same body as the formal utility. The issue of tariff fixing still remains unclear but&#13;
    benchmarking may provide more insight.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Regulating water markets in informal settlements. Existing complaint mechanisms need to be&#13;
    enhanced for both the utility and DPSP providers. This includes establishing channels for&#13;
    information flow to customers and allowing them to benchmark and make informed choices.&#13;
    There is also a need to address unequal access to resources (subsidies and finance) between&#13;
    utilities and DPSPs. In competitive environments, regulation should focus on water and service&#13;
    quality rather than price.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Making DPSP bankable: Some essential elements for making DPSP bankable are the legal&#13;
    status of the operator, credibility through a proven track record of accountability, viability of&#13;
    projects, sufficient cash reserves, the use of contracts or concessions as a guarantee, and&#13;
    references from other organizations like the municipality or ministry. It may be possible to explore&#13;
    the Grameen Bank system to address this challenge. Yet another aspect is on innovative&#13;
    collaterals. The question is whether contracts (essentially the customer base) can be an asset&#13;
    pledged as collateral for loans. At this stage, the implications for the operator remain unclear. If&#13;
    the contract is considered as an asset, the lending agency may proceed with a risk assessment.&#13;
    For long term contracts, a guarantee from the municipality would be helpful. In addition the&#13;
    contract may be linked to insurance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In conclusion, unlocking the potential of DPSP will require innovation in policy frameworks that&#13;
encourage scaling-up with bulk supply, development of simple contracts that enhance the efficiency of&#13;
DPSP, and regulation of water markets in informal settlements though incentives.&#13;

STREAM 2 ­ Sanitation Marketing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
State of Play&#13;
This session discussed current endeavors in sanitation marketing in Vietnam, Senegal, Burkina Faso,&#13;
Niger and South Asia, particularly Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Case Study 1&#13;
    Sanitation marketing in rural Vietnam: Jamie Frais, International Development Enterprises (IDE)&#13;
    IDE identified two coastal rural areas in Vietnam with similar environmental and socio-economic&#13;
    profiles, one to serve as control and the other as the experimental group. After situational and&#13;
    market assessments, IDE engaged in capacity building of local small-scale providers to supply&#13;
    sanitation to the community. A social marketing campaign was carried out to stimulate local&#13;
    demand for sanitation. As a result, access to sanitation rose from 16 to 35 percent within a year&#13;
    since the project's conception.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Case Study 2&#13;
    Urban sanitation marketing in West Africa - Burkina Faso, Niger and Senegal: Ousseynou Diop (WSP- AF)&#13;
    These three countries have adopted a strategy of social marketing and hygiene promotion to&#13;
    improve sanitation. The results have been varied but raise common issues around both demand&#13;
    and supply-side and subsidy issues. There is a need to understand the drivers for demand when&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       11&#13;

&#13;
    implementing sanitation programs, as well as to support SSIPs through capacity building and an&#13;
    enabling environment and finally, to have government cooperation and consensus on subsidy&#13;
    policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Case Study 3&#13;
    Total sanitation in South Asia: Shafiul Azam Ahmed (WSP-SA)&#13;
    With the support of positive changes in the policy environment of South Asia, the program of total&#13;
    sanitation was initiated in Bangladesh. A key aspect of the total sanitation program is the attempt&#13;
    to create behavioral changes within whole communities, rather than individual households. As a&#13;
    program it started by promoting the concept of total sanitation rather than products and services.&#13;
    After defining the concept, development models were created and demonstrated among targeted&#13;
    villages. This gained the acceptance of the community and created demand. The next step was&#13;
    to brand the approach as total sanitation and begin brand advertising. A nationwide brand&#13;
    marketing campaign is being developed to sell the concept of sanitation to the whole of&#13;
    Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Constraints&#13;
A number of key constraints were identified: demand-side, supply-side and enabling environment.&#13;
Promoting demand for sanitation is fundamental to its success. Research is required to segment the&#13;
demand and supply into reliable and affordable services and products to meet different customer&#13;
needs. Also, there is a need to build capacity among local players in market research. Another&#13;
constraint on demand is to ensure that the SSIPs have the capacity and resources to innovate and&#13;
meet the various demands. A final challenge is to develop ways of making demand sustainable over&#13;
time, once the initial program of stimulating the demand has been completed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
With regard to the supply-side, a lack of innovation among sanitation providers prevents them from&#13;
developing the sanitation market. The supply-side often lacks the competence to provide quality&#13;
sanitation and/or provide the type of sanitation demanded. Also, making sanitation completely private&#13;
may lead to suppliers charging high retail prices. Another constraint is the difficulty in linking different&#13;
role players including manufacturers, retailers, builders and pit exhausters to ensure a coherent&#13;
sanitation chain. There is also a need to demonstrate market opportunities and demand to the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The lack of an enabling environment poses constraints on sanitation. Without a nationwide policy,&#13;
successful projects cannot be scaled-up. An enabling environment for sanitation marketing is needed&#13;
as a precursor to building the capacity of supply and promotion of demand. Currently sanitation, as&#13;
opposed to water, is often overlooked and delegated as a low priority. Many feel that sanitation is a&#13;
household rather than a political issue. Finally, the subsidy issue is critical and requires consensus&#13;
among all stakeholders to avoid introducing market distortions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Responses&#13;
Cross-sector and country collaboration and information sharing can reduce the time and costs of&#13;
demand assessment and market research. Rapid market research requires limited funding and can&#13;
help develop sanitation marketing strategies and proposals that can be further refined following the&#13;
availability of additional resources. Where possible, market research should be included in the&#13;
sanitation marketing project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
On the supply side, the presence of intermediaries is required to assist the private sector with product&#13;
development and innovation. Skills development and accreditation for suppliers will improve their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ability to service demand. Access to credit, financial incentives and cooperation with sanitation&#13;
retailers can help keep the costs of supply down and encourage SSIPs to unlock the potential of the&#13;
market and accelerate sanitation services and product delivery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Improvement in creating an enabling environment requires a champion, political will and incentives.&#13;
Advocacy is needed to raise and mainstream the sanitation profile into financial instruments such as&#13;
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) PRSC, MTEF, and HIPC. The marketing approach does&#13;
not mean that governments should abdicate responsibility for sanitation and leave it to the private&#13;
sector. Governments should support the enabling environment, and effectively use public resources&#13;
for sanitation promotion, product development, market research, demand promotion, and waste&#13;
disposal. The use of mass organizations that can work together with national and local governments&#13;
can create a driving force for change. Selecting organizations and political partners that are&#13;
interested in implementing sanitation reforms through programs that look at behavioral change,&#13;
demand and supply building, rather than construction of infrastructure, create a better reform&#13;
environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key Action Areas&#13;
While some interesting experiences are being implemented, the sanitation marketing approach is still&#13;
nascent and there is a need for learning-by-doing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. The first action area identified is to enhance knowledge by facilitating an applied sanitation&#13;
     marketing and structured learning process. This could include the development of the SanMark&#13;
     branded network to exchange knowledge and experiences. But, as the concept is new, there is a&#13;
     need to put in place a peer review mechanism to ensure the quality and the applicability of the&#13;
     knowledge gained. This activity area should produce learning materials, best practices and&#13;
     learning events.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Sanitation marketing requires commitment and involvement of different stakeholders from&#13;
     different sectors. Therefore, a second activity area is to foster political will by facilitating the&#13;
     SanMark dialogue. This dialogue should include practitioners and politicians to showcase and&#13;
     exchange SanMark experiences, and develop political appetite, and consensus on approach&#13;
     including subsidy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Finally, sanitation marketing is about improving access to basic services. A third activity area is to&#13;
     leverage resources to support the implementation of SanMark programs. Supporting the on-&#13;
     going programs and developing policy for innovative new programs are needed to scale-up&#13;
     success stories. This will include learning-by-doing, mainstreaming SanMark in the MDG&#13;
     roadmap and PRSP/PRSC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The three activity areas are inter-linked as the SanMark Dialogue and the SanMark Implementation&#13;
Program will provide inputs to the SanMark Applied and Structured Learning Program. The SanMark&#13;
Dialogue will take place in countries and regions with sanitation coordination structures such as&#13;
Uganda, Burkina Faso and South Asia. The SanMark Implementation Support Program will be&#13;
undertaken in countries where a minimum consensus on sanitation approach is obtained such as&#13;
Vietnam and Tanzania.&#13;

STREAM 3 ­ Mobilizing Resources from the Private Finance Market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
State of Play&#13;
The Camdessus Report ­ Financing Water for All, 2000 ­ points out that the water sector faces two&#13;
critical financing challenges while expanding services to reach the MDGs on water and sanitation:&#13;
     · The need to close the financing shortfall between available public (including donor) resources&#13;
          and investments for new capital works and rehabilitation (i.e. leveraging additional domestic&#13;
          resources)&#13;
     · The need to ensure that resources are used efficiently, are well targeted, and result in&#13;
          sustainable service provision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Cost-recovery policies are implemented in the water sector in response to the financing challenges,&#13;
especially where public finance is limited and governments impose strict ceilings on sector&#13;
expenditure. There is a need to explore the possibility of leveraging non-public and market-based&#13;
resources from the private domestic financial market. In some countries, domestic financial&#13;
institutions are starting to develop business lines in the infrastructure sector on a commercial basis,&#13;
but water and sanitation are generally not pursued as a line of business. However, some finance&#13;
institutions have expressed interest in exploring the water sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Given the emerging institutional arrangements within the sector, two distinct market segments were&#13;
identified for mobilizing commercial resources, which also correspond to possible market segments&#13;
within financial markets:&#13;
     · Medium to large water utilities (mostly in urban centers and small towns). There is a&#13;
          possibility of funding through intermediation from domestic financing intermediaries (such&#13;
          as banks, specialized development finance institutions) as well as through direct market&#13;
          access (through bonds for debt, or equity).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     · Small water (and sanitation) services providers (comprising both community managed&#13;
          and small private local providers). These are largely funded through small loans from&#13;
          domestic private micro-finance institutions and/or commercial banks seeking opportunities&#13;
          of `micro-finance' ­ with a focus on developing a business line in small water projects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Constraints and responses&#13;
The experience of market finance in the water sector in developing countries is limited and several&#13;
constraints need to be overcome for the water sector to effectively tap the domestic financial market.&#13;
The finance stream acknowledged that the possibility of market borrowing had to be tackled within the&#13;
constraints of the overall country macro-environment beyond the water and financial sector. These&#13;
included political risk, degree of decentralization and autonomy, enforcement of contractual law and&#13;
the speed of the judiciary process. Some of the constraints and responses identified and discussed&#13;
were:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a. Medium to large water utilities&#13;
     Experience in mobilizing resources from domestic financial markets is wide ranging ­ varying&#13;
     from the USA and South Africa where most utilities access market funds, to many other countries&#13;
     where only one or two utilities have mobilized such funds. This has often been with considerable&#13;
     initial donor support, such as in Senegal or in India where direct market access through bonds&#13;
     has been attempted, but not necessarily linked to utility reforms. The South African and USA&#13;
     experience also differ as the first is moving towards the use of intermediaries whereas the latter is&#13;
     through a mix of municipal bonds and intermediaries such as state bond banks. There is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

considerable worldwide experience in specialized financial intermediaries ranging from a variety&#13;
of USA state bond banks, FINDETER in Columbia, infrastructure financing institutions such as&#13;
INCA in South Africa to the recently set up joint IFC-World Bank Municipal Fund. In the&#13;
Philippines, specialized sector level policy and institutional options are being explored with&#13;
support from the World Bank to facilitate access to domestic resources for small water utilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Some of the specific constraints and responses identified and discussed with regard to medium to&#13;
large water utilities were:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· Sequencing of reform and investment need to be examined case by case. Reform and&#13;
    capacity building are as important as finance in the expansion of services. Often it is argued&#13;
    that reform and capacity building is necessary before financial resources are sought to&#13;
    expand services. There are many instances where investment have proceeded ahead of&#13;
    reform or have in fact become a palliative to much needed structural changes. In some cases&#13;
    reform efforts have faltered for lack of early visible improvements in services due to lack of&#13;
    funding. There is broad acceptance that in situations of lagging coverage and depleted assets&#13;
    reform has to be accompanied by adequate funding to produce early results, to restore&#13;
    production capacity and to expand the customer basis. This being said the proper sequencing&#13;
    of reform and investment remains a critical issue akin to the chicken-and-egg dilemma to be&#13;
    addressed in each specific context. However, examples do exist of where market-based&#13;
    financing is brought in as a means to underpin reform. Private financiers, for instance,&#13;
    contributed to the financing of urban water reform in Senegal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· Tailoring of interventions to local context is critical. Each situation should be regarded as&#13;
    unique. For example, when market-based resources were sought in the South African water&#13;
    sector, it became apparent that experiences abroad could not be replicated (from Mexico for&#13;
    example), but had to be adapted to the local context and constraints. For this to work, it is&#13;
    important to allow and encourage financial ingenuity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· Everyone is creditworthy - it is just a matter of degree. Utilities are often not perceived to be&#13;
    creditworthy, especially if credit rating tools that are developed for more mature and specific&#13;
    market (such as Standard and Poors ­ S&amp;P) are applied. For instance, non-creditworthy&#13;
    borrowers (by S&amp;P) in South Africa are able to access credit in the market place. It is&#13;
    therefore important to develop local knowledge and information that will inform domestic&#13;
    lenders. Local credit rating and information sharing networks, such as the Water Utility&#13;
    Partnership (WUP) are therefore useful tools. But it is important to understand the client base&#13;
    as well as the information needs. Establishing track records and time series data for&#13;
    individual utilities were recognized as more relevant than comparative data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· Municipality or utility ­ who should borrow? Constraints and responses might be different&#13;
    depending on whether the borrower is a municipality or a commercial or private utility.&#13;
    Municipalities are perceived to be more complex in terms of sources of finance (and less&#13;
    transparent), whereas commercial utilities have to rely mainly on user fees. Utilities can also&#13;
    be liquidated, but not municipalities. It was recognized that further work would need to tackle&#13;
    specific constraints and responses related to the different borrowers to encourage greater&#13;
    inflows of private capital into the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· Capacity of borrowers (and of lenders) needs to be built. There is a lack of bankable projects&#13;
    in the water sector. A greater number are needed to turn the sector around to attract financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       inflows. For this, reform and institutional development is needed. Citizen voice and&#13;
       transactions support were some relevant approaches discussed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   · Why go to the marketplace if subsidized credits are cheaper? Donor or government grants&#13;
       and/or subsidized credits are often cheaper for borrowers and hamper the development of&#13;
       market-based financing. Often however, they come with conditions and high transaction&#13;
       costs. This still leaves room for the private sector as the INCA ­ a financial intermediary ­&#13;
       experience in South Africa demonstrates. INCA is able to lend to utilities at higher rates,&#13;
       because they can respond to demand and keep transaction costs low. It is however important&#13;
       that donor and government grants are designed to attract not discourage private money..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Finance for small water (and sanitation) service providers&#13;
As a result of reform, small water service providers are increasingly becoming important in the&#13;
expansion of services. Three experiences of where market borrowing has been introduced in the&#13;
water sector were discussed - Bangladesh, Kenya and Senegal. Some of the specific constraints and&#13;
responses identified and discussed with regard to small providers were:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   · Adverse policy environment to market-borrowing. Though cost-recovery principles are&#13;
       introduced in the sector, they are often not implemented, and this makes market borrowing&#13;
       difficult. This often stems from supply-side planning that does not take demand into account in&#13;
       the development of water projects. Free funding or grants also shut out private money. Some&#13;
       of the actions that were discussed to address these issues were financial management&#13;
       training and informing citizens by exposing them to best practice. The issue of better targeting&#13;
       of grant assistance to crowd in market finance was also covered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   · Lack of knowledge. A key constraint for market-based financing is that banks do not&#13;
       understand water (and sanitation) and water providers do not understand banks. To&#13;
       overcome this problem on the bank side, it is important for banks to reach out to potential&#13;
       clients and develop a loan culture. One starting point is to encourage the creation of bank&#13;
       accounts and savings. On the other side, the water sector needs to demonstrate bankability&#13;
       by demonstrating to the financial sector that there is money in water (revenues from sale),&#13;
       and develop trust and mechanisms that ensure that fees will be collected and so that banks&#13;
       can access their money.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   · Inappropriate financial structures. Some of the financial constraints, especially with regard to&#13;
       the financing of small providers and microfinance, are the lack of long-term finance, high&#13;
       costs to the borrowers, and lack of collateral at project level and difficulties in securing&#13;
       revenue streams. To address this, it is important to work with the local financial sector to&#13;
       design appropriate financial instruments. For instance, the microfinance sector in Senegal has&#13;
       worked with commercial banks to extend credit tenor, and offer savings packages to lock in&#13;
       savings for longer periods. In some instances, however, it might be difficult to extend tenures&#13;
       due to local financial conditions and associated high debt servicing cost, and assistance from&#13;
       guarantee/ tenure extension agencies need to be sought.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   · Weak business environment. Weak demand-side capacity, especially in management and&#13;
       operations, continues to plague the sector. The legal framework for asset ownership and&#13;
       licensing is also ineffectual in the sector. Capacity building of borrowers, financiers and&#13;
       support organizations is therefore needed together with developing appropriate legal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    16&#13;

&#13;
         frameworks. Monitoring, reporting and assessments tools are required in addition to aligning&#13;
         the demand and supply structures to overall reform processes and decentralization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Action Areas&#13;
WSP and a number of other actors in the sector are developing ways to address some of these&#13;
issues. As part of the DPSP Initiative, WSP is now planning to take some of these forward, working&#13;
with partner agencies in support of a few focus countries' efforts. A tentative workplan has been&#13;
developed for the early stages of the DPSP Initiative. A few specific activities have been identified to&#13;
maintain progress in developing approaches for each market segment as a part of WSP's country and&#13;
regional activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Water utilities segment. The proposed activities for the first year include:&#13;
         o A scoping study in Africa to develop a better understanding of the possibility and support&#13;
             measures necessary for mobilization of market based resources by urban water service&#13;
             providers using both demand (utility profiles and WS sector policy framework) and supply-&#13;
             side (banks and other specialized financial institutions, and financial sector assessments)&#13;
             assessments. This will be backed by assessment or benchmarking of utility and&#13;
             municipalities in collaboration with Water Utility Partnership (WUP)&#13;
         o Support to the Government of Philippines to assess various sector specific proposals,&#13;
             jointly with the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Small providers segment. To date, there is limited experience. Under DPSP, the proposal is to&#13;
    build on WSP's work in Kenya and Bangladesh. In Kenya, WSP-AF has been working with Public&#13;
    Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) funding to assist a leading domestic micro-finance&#13;
    institution to develop business lines for small water projects in rural and per-urban areas.&#13;
    Demand side issues are being addressed through business development services and policy&#13;
    issues are being tackled by working with the relevant public sector institutions. In Bangladesh,&#13;
    WSP supports the Bank-funded Bangladesh Water Supply Program Project (BWSSP) to provide&#13;
    capacity building to project partners. This includes local governments to enable them to address&#13;
    challenges in planning, financial management, project management and monitoring, and to NGOs&#13;
    and sponsors in preparing for, implementing and managing piped water schemes in rural areas.&#13;
    Under the BWSSP a significant proportion of project investment is to be mobilized from the micro-&#13;
    finance sector. The proposed activities include:&#13;
         o Continuation of policy and transactions support to the country initiatives in Kenya and&#13;
             Bangladesh&#13;
         o Use of these experiences to develop similar support in at least one country in Africa. This&#13;
             will most likely be Senegal where initial enquiries suggest good potential and interest from&#13;
             the government and market players&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Inputs and Potential Partnerships. Partnerships were recognized as critical to moving forward.&#13;
    Partnerships are important in:&#13;
         o Shaping and refining the tentative list of activities&#13;
         o Developing strong linkages between WSP's work program and other opportunities and&#13;
             clients&#13;
         o Developing a long-term vision for the finance work program under the DPSP Initiative.&#13;

STREAM 4 ­ Consumer Voice&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
State of play&#13;
This consumer stream session focused on consumer engagement, arguably the weakest pillar of the&#13;
reform of urban water and sanitation. The session reviewed the paradigm of inter-relationships&#13;
between providers, policy makers and consumers in service provision, and discussed various case&#13;
studies to draw lessons on how WSP and its partners could shape on going work to boost consumers'&#13;
capacities to demand accountability and performance from service providers and policy makers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Case Studies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Case study 1: Citizen action and Voice in Bolivia in the late 1990's&#13;
    The context is Bolivia in 1997 and 1999 in "Aguas del Illimani" (Suez) and Cochabamba,&#13;
    respectively. Consumer action was triggered by slow expansion of services to the poor, high&#13;
    connection costs and tariffs, lack of investment targets, poor handling of clients and lack of&#13;
    accountability to the users. The consumer action involved information campaigns by local groups&#13;
    and collective protest. The impact was an acknowledgement at policy level of how services were&#13;
    affecting the poor, a re-examination of contracts entered into, and a decision to consider its&#13;
    termination by 2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Consumer unrest in the city of Cochabamba was sparked by the raising of water tariffs by&#13;
    between 100 and 400 percent, and the promulgation of a new law for water and sanitation&#13;
    services that was perceived by consumers as unjustifiable and favoring the private sector.&#13;
    Consumer action consisted of mass social movements, demonstrations, and protests which&#13;
    culminated in the emotive `Water War' where lives were lost. The result was policy reform that&#13;
    saw the responsibility for service delivery returned to the municipal utility in the year 2000. The&#13;
    resultant political changes at the highest level demonstrated, on the one hand, the price of&#13;
    neglecting to engage between policy makers, provider and citizens and, on the other, the power&#13;
    of self determination latent in consumer voice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Case Study 2: Pakistan: Action by Government to Support Consumer Engagement&#13;
    The context is a client-focused government initiated program in Pakistan where two towns,&#13;
    Karachi and Jaranwala, responded to the implementation challenge. The issue was perennial&#13;
    inefficiency in service delivery by non-responsive utilities. Government action in Karachi within the&#13;
    context of the program was to establish a public complaint center with an online facility which&#13;
    could lodge and track complaints. Monitoring Committees were set-up and public hearings on the&#13;
    budget were encouraged. Citizen Community Boards whose role was to participate in community&#13;
    development were implemented and supported. Transparency International was co-opted to&#13;
    improve the efficiency of the system and to control corruption. The impact was an improvement of&#13;
    services and an increase of customer satisfaction as evidenced by a survey that placed&#13;
    satisfaction levels at 65 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Government action in Jaranwala involved encouraging public participation in budget sessions&#13;
    through the local cable network and institutionalizing of the CRC in service delivery. Public private&#13;
    partnership was formalized by outsourcing the role of monitoring of service delivery, and&#13;
    regulation and tariff collection. It further adopted and replicated a component-based sanitation&#13;
    model in collaboration with a local NGO. The resultant impact was improved client satisfaction&#13;
    with a rating of 72 percent.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Case study 3: Joint Consumer and Government Action in Senegal&#13;
    The context was the city of Dakar in Senegal which faced consumer discontent over water tariffs.&#13;
    Consumer and government action created a stakeholder partnership between the Municipality of&#13;
    Dakar, the local authorities and citizen groups. These groups jointly engaged in the development&#13;
    of indicators for a survey on local profiles, compilation of best practice, commissioning of citizen&#13;
    satisfactory surveys, campaigns and engagement with the media. This culminated in participatory&#13;
    planning with real communication and joint assessment of progress. The impact in the short term&#13;
    was a reduction in the price of water through an adjusted tariff. At the level of process, positive&#13;
    energy was released and transparent decision making tools provided the opportunity for reflection&#13;
    and policy dialogue across the policy-consumer divide.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Case study 4: Lessons on Strengthening Consumer Voice from Pilot Project in Africa&#13;
    The context was Chad, Kenya, Senegal and Zambia where selected consumer organizations&#13;
    obtained institutional support from WSP and Consumers International to strengthen consumer&#13;
    voice in the water sector. Consumer action consisted of country reviews, national stakeholder&#13;
    meetings, capacity building and training on sector issues, and country level action plans. Action at&#13;
    country level was varied and ranged from demonstrations on pricing, petitions, rallies, and&#13;
    engagement with the media to representation on regulatory boards and service delivery projects.&#13;
    Impacts were lessons on consumer voice engagement in the sector. For consumer voice to be&#13;
    effective, it was realized that the capacity, legitimacy, representation and tools for consumer&#13;
    engagement would need to be addressed. This led to the formulation of a subsequent project of&#13;
    WSP to introduce the Citizen Report Card (CRC) which will be implemented in other African&#13;
    cities. The overall objective of this project will be to motivate utilities to improve service delivery to&#13;
    the poor. The specific objective will be to build the capacity of Civil Society Organizations to&#13;
    undertake CRCs on an ongoing basis to perform a benchmarking role.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Case study 5: The Citizen Report Card as a Tool for Strengthening Consumer Voice&#13;
    Citizen Report Cards entail a random sample survey of the users of different public services&#13;
    (utilities), and the aggregation of the users' experiences as a basis for rating the services. CRCs&#13;
    also help to convert individual problems facing the various programs into common sector issues.&#13;
    They serve to identify the key constraints that citizens (especially the poor and the underserved)&#13;
    face in accessing public services, benchmark the quality and adequacy of these services as well&#13;
    as the effectiveness of staff providing services. In addition, they facilitate prioritization of reforms&#13;
    and corrective action by drawing attention to the problems highlighted. CRCs also encourage&#13;
    cross fertilization of ideas and approaches by identifying good practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Group Conclusions and Proposed Action&#13;
The first three country cases demonstrated the immense potential of the power held by consumer&#13;
voice to put pressure on authorities and, in this way, contribute towards tailoring of policy on service&#13;
delivery in favor of the poor. Provider-consumer engagement, which is the short route of&#13;
accountability, needs to be cultivated through a proactive acknowledgement of consumers as clients.&#13;
The cases demonstrated that the highest levels of tension between consumers and policy makers&#13;
occurred when the need for dialogue at this level was not taken seriously. In general, policy makers&#13;
need to ensure space for reflection and policy dialogue as well as provide mechanisms for redress&#13;
through formal consultation and outlets such as customer clinics. Consumers face challenges of&#13;
capacity, minimal understanding on how to work collectively and how to deal with representation, and&#13;
the absence of robust tools. These experiences are captured in the boxes below.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The case studies set the stage for brainstorming on the issues affecting strong consumer voice which&#13;
were clustered under the following topics:&#13;
    a) Weak citizen representation and a lack of legitimacy&#13;
    b) Poor consumer information, education and empowerment&#13;
    c) Lack of formal provision for citizen engagement and lack of engagement of citizens groups in&#13;
        reform&#13;
    d) Low receptivity of service providers to engage with citizens&#13;
    e) Politicization of consumer issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The following proposals were put forward for consumer engagement:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Knowledge development in consumer voice. Learning and exchange should take place at global,&#13;
regional and sub-regional levels. This could be facilitated by exchange visits, desk studies,&#13;
documentation and dissemination of best practice on consumer voice from other&#13;
sectors/organizations which have achieved legitimacy and impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Consumer legitimacy was analyzed as being negatively affected by;&#13;
    · Weak representation where consumer bodies have not tackled how to handle diverse needs&#13;
        and interests&#13;
    · Capacity to organize, mobilize and manage engagement processes&#13;
    · Low credibility where they have not established a track record to speak on issues in the&#13;
        sector&#13;
    · `Invisibility' which is a problem of profile and track record if policy makers and service&#13;
        providers are unable to identify a group to relate with the cause.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The session proposed actions to deal with consumer legitimacy by supporting the process of&#13;
organization, representation, development of formal mandates and terms of reference (ToRs). At the&#13;
same time, efforts to build capacity of lead institutions undertaking this work would be explored in&#13;
South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Another strategy proposed was the formation of alliances for capacity and visibility, across citizen&#13;
groups, with international consumer and citizen organizations, and research institutions (in South Asia&#13;
and Africa). It was also proposed that opportunities for developing capacity in process management&#13;
could be explored to strengthen consumer legitimacy.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Consumer education, information and empowerment should be encouraged to strengthen the&#13;
  legitimacy and mandate of consumer groups. Consumer education relates to skills such as&#13;
  influencing, negotiating and engaging collectively, and understanding how to make use of resources.&#13;
  Consumer information provides data, facts and insight on the goods or services, and to what extent&#13;
  the situation is affecting consumers. Consumers need to have information on their rights but also their&#13;
  responsibilities. Empowerment is the process by which consumers are equipped to engage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Education should be approached from both the supply and demand side. From the supply side, work&#13;
  could be done to encourage and show appreciation to the regulator/policy maker when engaging with&#13;
  citizens in a variety of ways including encouraging clinics, help desks or by providing information on&#13;
  consumer charters and performance contracts. At the same time they should build on learning by&#13;
  assembling best practice and facilitating cross fertilization of experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The group endorsed the use of the Report Card tool as holding potential in Latin America, Africa and&#13;
  South Asia to provide information. Through a multi-stakeholder process the CRC could improve&#13;
 dialogue and provide space for reflection and learning. A legitimate organ would then improve&#13;
 understanding on processes of engagement as both provider and consumer would interact as&#13;
 demonstrated in the Senegal and Pakistan cases. This would also promote understanding of the role&#13;
 of citizen representation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Receptivity of service providers and formalizing consumer engagement. This area was viewed&#13;
  as a capacity and exposure issue, and the group proposed that successful case studies as seen in&#13;
  Senegal and Ukraine be developed and disseminated as advocacy materials. Building on work done&#13;
  by others could encourage service providers to engage with consumer and citizen organizations. The&#13;
  uptake of the Report Card tool findings by utilities as it is piloted by WSP could provide useful lessons&#13;
  in this regard. It was also proposed that consumer theme facilitate meetings/workshops in several&#13;
  towns (Africa, South Asia) for cross fertilization of experiences.&#13;

5 Final Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Final plenary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The objective of the final plenary was to exchange information with all participants and provide&#13;
  feedback on the different thematic areas. Since the workshop covered a wide range of issues, a short&#13;
  session was dedicated to providing an overview of the linkages, commonalities and differences&#13;
  identified in the four streams. A key objective of this final session was to provide participants with an&#13;
  understanding of the process and the way forward. The final overview also provided an opportunity to&#13;
  summarize findings from each stream. Some overlapping issues identified from the themes include:&#13;
       -   The importance of an effective enabling environment&#13;
       -   Blending of public and private finance&#13;
       -   The need to bridge the gap between financiers and service providers&#13;
       -   Legitimacy, formalization and recognition (among service providers and consumers)&#13;
       -   The need for greater learning from other sectors (such as energy or transport)&#13;
       -   Understanding priorities for scaling up&#13;
       -   Linkages between the streams, particularly through strengthening consumers' capacities to&#13;
           develop mechanisms for accountability&#13;
       -   Need for performance monitoring, financing, transaction design and contracting&#13;
       -   Capacity development for financiers, consumers/citizens, regulators&#13;
  These issues are illustrated in Figure 4.&#13;

            The Domestic Private Sector
            Participation (DPSP) initiative is a Department for
            International Development (DFID) funded program that is
            being implemented by the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP)
            to unlock the potential of domestic private providers and
            finance in the delivery of water and sanitation services to
            the poor. It is intended to implement the program globally,
            through the WSP regional programs. This workshop report
            summarizes the proceedings and outputs of a global
            practitioners' workshop for the DPSP initiative held in
            Nairobi June 20-21, 2005.
