                                                I.COUNTRYBACKGROUND&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
  1.         Since the GovernmentofVietnam declaredthe presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza&#13;
(HPAI)', an estimated44 million poultry have either died of the disease or have beenculled2. The&#13;
disease has spreadto most countries in SoutheastAsia, and Vietnam is one oftwo countries inthe region&#13;
 inwhich humanfatalities from the diseaseoccurredas the result ofthe direct transmissionofthe virus&#13;
from poultry to humans. The H5N1 HPAI epidemic inVietnam has caused at least 15 humandeaths and&#13;
a much larger number of suspected infections. As yet, however, the disease has not developedthe&#13;
capacityto spreadbetweenhumans. After the first confirmed cases, occurring on 25 December 2003, the&#13;
outbreak spread rapidly throughout the country, overwhelmingthe capacity of the veterinary servicesand&#13;
disease surveillancesystemsto containthe epidemic. Lackingthe necessary fine-tuned field monitoring&#13;
systems and diagnostic capacity to deal with the outbreakby means of selective, strategic containment,&#13;
the Governmentadopteda policy ofdepopulatinglargeareas under which both infected andnon-infected&#13;
poultry were culled. All poultry movement was halted, live-poultry markets were closed, and stringent&#13;
disinfection and other biosecurity measures were introduced. A new outbreakwas reportedon May 4 in&#13;
the Ho Chi Minharea. Since early March, these measures have beenrelaxedon a province-by-province&#13;
basiswhenever it is observedthat 30 days have elapsedsince the last outbreak.&#13;
&#13;
2.           Aside from the significant public health implications, total poultry losses from the outbreak&#13;
 amount to nearly one-sixthof the national poultry inventory. These losses are creatingserious economic&#13;
hardship, not only for commercialandrural poultry owners but also for the poultry service trade. With&#13;
the withdrawal ofpoultry meatfrom the market, the prices ofother meats have risenby as muchas thirty&#13;
percent, well beyondthe reach of lower-income consumers. While the epidemic appears to have been&#13;
brought under control, there remains a strongpossibility that with the resumptionof poultry trade andthe&#13;
re-stocking of depopulatedfarms, new flare-ups will occur. Since these flare-ups may well coincide with&#13;
the seasonofhumaninfluenzathe riskofgenetic exchange betweenthe two types ofvirus, whilst&#13;
 concurrently infecting a commonhost, remains a remote possibility with potentially serious public health&#13;
 outcomesshould humanto humantransmissionresult.&#13;
&#13;
3.           The proposedemergency recoveryproject would, supportthe National Action Plan for the&#13;
control of HPAI. Inparticular, it would assist the government instrengtheningits disease surveillance&#13;
systemto identify new HPAIoutbreaks inatimely manner, rehabilitate affected poultry farmers and&#13;
strengthenthe diagnostic and field surveillancemechanismsto better guardagainstfuture outbreaks(see&#13;
Appendix 1 for project designsummary and log-frame). Monitoringand surveillanceto confirm the&#13;
absence of HPAI in de-stockedareas prior to restocking is of utmost priority and needsto be undertaken&#13;
 immediately, well before scheduled project implementation. Similarly, all breedingfarms must be&#13;
certified free of infection before releasingchicks on the market. Funds from other ongoing projects(such&#13;
as FAO/TCP) shouldbe utilized to support these immediateneeds.&#13;

4.      The government's veterinary, diagnostic and surveillance services were overwhelmedby the&#13;
recent HPAIoutbreak, which has highlightedthe needto strengthen the National Action Plan, implement&#13;
equitable mechanisms for compensating affected farmers, institute a rapid-response surveillance system&#13;
to identify and control animal disease outbreaks, establish a rapid reporting system, expand public&#13;
awareness and information relatedto the human healthhazards of zoonotic disease, and develop&#13;
strategies for reorganizingthe poultry sector as a means for dealing with future outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;
DamageAssessment&#13;
&#13;
5.      Interms ofeconomic losses, the total cost ofdepopulating poultry from infected areas, along&#13;
with the disinfection of farms and bird disposal is estimated to beVND600 billion (US$40 million). In&#13;
addition, losses of a similar magnitude resultedfrom upstream and downstream impacts on commercial&#13;
and ruralpoultry holders and poultry traders, feed mills, sale of day-old chicks by breedingfarms and&#13;
lost production by broiler and layer farms. Containing the epidemic is estimated to have cost the&#13;
government VND600 billion. The estimated total damage assessment thus amounts to VND1,800 billion&#13;
(US$l20 million), equivalent to 0.3% o f GNP. Incomparison, the estimated project investment cost only&#13;
of US$6.2 million suggests a highly favorable economic rate of return for project interventions.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Responseto Avian InfluenzaEmergency&#13;
&#13;
6.      The government reactedforcefully to containthe HPAIepidemic, once its scope and ferocity&#13;
became apparent. It established a multi-ministerial AI SteeringCommittee (AISC) chairedby the&#13;
Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, and comprising representatives of the Ministries of&#13;
Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), Health, Finance, Planning and Investmentand others. A&#13;
National Action Plan for the Control o f HPAIwas drafted to provide guidelines for containing the&#13;
epidemic, to be implementedby the AI Working Group, comprisingthe various technical animal&#13;
husbandry and animal health institutes, the two northern (Hanoi) and southern (Ho Chi MinhCity)&#13;
regional veterinary diagnostic laboratories, and the provincial, commune and village level veterinary&#13;
services (SDAH). At the commune and village levels, Commune AI Control Committees, comprising&#13;
commune leaders, law and order personnel, and animal healthworkers, sampled affected farms and&#13;
supervisedthe control of animal movement, cullingand disposal.&#13;
&#13;
7.      As a resulto fthe wholesale culling o f diseasedand unaffectedbirds, albeit at serious cost to the&#13;
poultry sub-sector, the government has beenremarkably successful incontaining the HPAIoutbreak.&#13;
However, the epidemic has highlightedseveral weaknesses inthe animal health services system.&#13;
Diagnostic laboratories were overwhelmed and the six Regional Veterinary Centers (RVCs) provedto be&#13;
rather ineffective. The lack o f epidemiological resources prevented strategic culling and control&#13;
measures, with the result that culling was likely to have been higher than required. Operatingbudgets&#13;
provedto be inadequateto bear the additional cost o f physical and human resources to deal with the&#13;
outbreak, a compensation policy for affected poultry holders was lacking and under funded, and the&#13;
communications linkages betweenthe central government and its 64 provinces were very weak.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    - 2 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8.       The response ofthe international community to the epidemic has beensubstantial. WHO, OIE&#13;
andF A 0 each sent teams and expertsto assist the government incontainingthe outbreak, andseveral&#13;
bilateral assistance agencies andNGOs donated protective clothing, disinfectants and other goods and&#13;
services. It is estimatedthat, by end-February2004, some 160person-monthsof expert input had been&#13;
provided inorder to deal with the outbreak. As the HPAIepidemic spreadacross SoutheastAsia, FAO,&#13;
OIE, and WHO calledtwo regional emergency meetingsto discusscontrol strategies, share information,&#13;
andforge linkages betweenthe affectedandnon-affectedcountries inthe region. FA0 approved&#13;
regional and country-focusedTCPs to providetechnical assistancewith disease diagnosis and&#13;
epidemiological surveillance. Vietnam is presentlyhostingan emergency assistance TCP team&#13;
(TCPNIEI3003(E)) to assist MARD/DAH with disease containment strategiesand strengtheningof the&#13;
diagnostic system. This TCP project would meshwith the designof the proposedAIERP, which would&#13;
provide interventionsto follow the TCP emergency effort now underway.&#13;
&#13;
ResponseGap and the responseby IDA&#13;
&#13;
9.       The World BankADA respondedto a request by the Governmentto preparean emergency&#13;
recoveryproject and a World Bank/FAO CooperativeProgrampreparationteam visited Vietnam from&#13;
March 3 to 26,2004 to work with MARDIICD to identify and preparethe proposedproject. The Team&#13;
collaboratedclosely with a mission from Agence Franqaise de De`veloppement(AFD) that produceda&#13;
report onthe HPAI outbreak, its consequences and recovery strategies. The Team also liaised daily with&#13;
veterinary diagnostic and epidemiological consultants, inVietnam under the FAO/TCP to advise the&#13;
government on recoveryand preventivestrategies. Inview ofthe scope andtiming ofthe FAO/TCP&#13;
input, the project designwill buildon its immediate-terminputsby designingamedium-termproject with&#13;
a 2-year lifespan.&#13;
&#13;
LessonsLearned&#13;
&#13;
10.      Relevant lessons for the designofthe proposedproject (AIERP) canbe drawn from previous&#13;
IDA andFAO-supportedemergencyrecoveryprojectsoutside Vietnam. Most ofthese projectshave&#13;
focusedon the supply of planting materials (seeds and fruit trees) and other agricultural inputs. Lessons&#13;
learnedindicatethat project success depends entirelyon the speed ofthe inputssupplied. Inproduction&#13;
systems, particularly for smallholders, speedy, efficient andtransparent distribution of suitable key inputs&#13;
is clearly a major factor in limiting the impact of a crisis and hasteningrecovery. InEast Timor, IDA&#13;
supportedanAgricultural Rehabilitation Projectwhich involved the restorationof priority assets,&#13;
including poultry and ruminant livestock following the violence that precededthat country's&#13;
independence. The same lessons indicatedabove can be useful for AIERP implementation.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Although IDA has not supportedpreviousemergencyprojects inVietnam, it did supporttwo&#13;
emergency projects inneighboring Cambodia: the EmergencyRehabilitationProject (Cr. 2550) approved&#13;
in 1993, andthe EconomicRehabilitation Project(Cr. 2781) in 1995. A performanceaudit ofthese two&#13;
projectsdrew the following relevant lessons. Project design should: (a) be consistent and cohesive, (b)&#13;
include no policy reforms, and (c) be simple indesign andtake account of limited Borrower capacity.&#13;
Other important lessons from past emergency projects inthe region suggest that: (a) speedof appraisal&#13;
and implementationare crucial to project success, (b) procurement needsto be flexible and should begin&#13;
at an early stage, (c) mitigation measures should be includedto minimize repeatdisaster, and (d) project&#13;
design should remain simple for rapidexecution3.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
12.      The implementationof the EU-financed Vietnam: Strengthening Veterinary Services Project&#13;
(SVSP) was hampered by design complexity well beyondthe capacity of MARDcounterpart staff.&#13;
Attempts to address structural and policy issues underthe project failed because government was not&#13;
ready for the structural changes proposed. Lessons learned from the project completion review of SVSP&#13;
includedthe need for design simplicity, the needto realistically assess counterpart absorption capacity,&#13;
and for effective communications. All of the above factors will play a significant role inthe&#13;
implementation of AIEW.&#13;
&#13;
Rationalefor IDA involvement&#13;
&#13;
13.      Soon after the onset of the crisis, MARD requested World Bank assistanceto help limit the&#13;
spread of the AI outbreak and to consider an emergency recovery operation for Vietnam. MARD&#13;
considers that the Bank has an important role to play by helpingthe Government to coordinate donor&#13;
assistance.&#13;
&#13;
14.      The Government is very much inneedof expert technical advice on the strategy it should follow&#13;
to recover from the present crisis and for the future control of AI. The recent epidemic clearly revealed&#13;
the difficulties for veterinary and extension services to cope with an animal health epidemic ofthis&#13;
nature. Becauseo f its many years o f close collaboration with MARD, the Bank can communicate&#13;
effectively with the GoV bothon agricultural policy and technical matters. Onthe technical aspects, the&#13;
Bank has accumulated world-wide experience inthe animal health sector and draws on a strong pool o f&#13;
expertise within the SASKIThematic Group, and maintains strong ties to international organizations&#13;
such as FAO, OIE and WHO. The Bank has also beeninvolved in longer term matters concerning WTO&#13;
accession. The build up o f adequate capacity to meet SPS requirements are o f critical importance for&#13;
Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
15.      The proposed AIEW would provide support only for two years. However, it could also provide&#13;
a useful basis for possible longer-term support for development and restructuring of the livestock sector,&#13;
perhaps as a component o f a follow-up to the ongoing Agricultural DiversificationProject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Projectobjectives&#13;
&#13;
16.      The uroiect's overall goal is to addressthe short and medium-termactions to be undertaken by&#13;
the Government to strengthenits veterinary surveillanceand diagnostic infrastructure inorder to avoid,&#13;
or at least minimize, a recurrence o f AI that would further damage the poultry sub-sector.&#13;
&#13;
17.      The develoument objectives of the proposed project are threefold insupport o fthe National&#13;
Action Plan for the control of Avian Influenza Epidemic: (a) to strengthendisease surveillance and&#13;
diagnostic capacity inthe control o f HPAI; (b) to strengthen the poultry sector infrastructureto better&#13;
cope with serious diseaseoutbreaks; and (c) to safeguard human health by improving public awareness&#13;
and information. A project designsummary and log-frame are presentedinAppendix 1.&#13;
&#13;
18.      Long-term involvement. The above objectives should be viewed as the first phase o f a longer-&#13;
termprogramaimed at restructuringVietnam's poultry sub-sector and strengtheningthe veterinary&#13;
services systemto deal with other potentially destructive infectious disease outbreaks. The proposed&#13;
project would therefore serve as a pioneeringeffort to evaluate the methodologies most suitable for&#13;
emergency preparedness and longer-term intervention.&#13;

                               ComponentB Poultry subsector rehabilitation&#13;
                                              -&#13;
&#13;
25.     The Component is designedto support the rehabilitation of the poultry subsector which was&#13;
severely affectedby the avian influenza epidemic by providing new Grand-Parent(GP) poultry breeding&#13;
stocks andupgradingthe biosecurity of government-ownedGP poultry breedingfarms. A number of&#13;
strategic studies will be also conductedto assistpoultry sector development. Activities under this&#13;
componentwould be carried out by the Department of Agriculture (DA). The componentcomprises&#13;
three subcomponents presentedbelow (see detaileddescription inAppendix 4).&#13;
&#13;
26.      Subcomponent B.1-Breedingstock supplv. Underthis subcomponent a total of 15,000 GP&#13;
poultry and ducks would be imported inPY1and PY2 to augmentthe GP stock of twelve (12) poultry&#13;
breedingfarms under MARD.4This stock would be specifically suitable for village rearing.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Replacement day-old chicks would be suppliedfrom this stockvia multiplier farms to village poultry&#13;
holders. The procurementof breedingstock will be conditional onthe completion of satisfactory&#13;
biosecurity measures(see subcomponent B.2 below) on those GP farms inwhich the newly arrived GP&#13;
stock would be housed.&#13;
&#13;
27.      SubcomponentB.2 -Upgradingbiosecuritv of GP farms. The subcomponentwould support&#13;
biosecurity upgradingofthe above-mentioned 12GP poultry farms under MARD, to reinforce their&#13;
defenses against future infectious disease outbreaks. Biosecurity upgradingwould encompass the&#13;
installation of quarantinefacilities, perimeter security fencing, improved water and waste disposal&#13;
systems, personneldisinfection entry units andupgradedlaboratory facilities. Following a preparationof&#13;
engineeringbiosecurity and constructiondesigns of all 12GP farms by national consultants, an&#13;
internationally recruitedpoultry farm biosecurity specialist would be contractedto review andevaluate&#13;
designs, and evaluate biosecurity measures basedon which project-supportedbiosecurity upgrading&#13;
would take place. The biosecurity evaluationunder this subcomponentwould be financedby the FA0&#13;
TCP.&#13;
&#13;
28.     SubcomponentB.3 - Strategic studies. The subcomponentwould finance two strategy studies on&#13;
compensationpolicy, poultry sector restructuring, and a survey ofpoultry losses resulting from the A I&#13;
epidemic. The compensationpolicy study would provide a framework for an equitable national&#13;
compensationpolicy by which to provide restitutionto producersfollowing serious animal disease&#13;
outbreaks. The poultry sector restructuringstudy would provide guidelines to better preparethe poultry&#13;
sector to withstand serious disease outbreaks. The poultry losses survey would identify the causes of&#13;
poultry culled, either for disease or preventivereasons, inthe ten project provinces. This subcomponent&#13;
would be entirely financedunder the FA0 TCP.&#13;
&#13;
                             Component C-Public awarenessand information&#13;
&#13;

33.       This component covers project management and will be managedby the AIERPFCU. This unit&#13;
will be placedwithin the existing PCU of the IDA-fundedAgricultural Diversification Project, now&#13;
under implementation. The PCU will report directly to the Agricultural Project ManagementBoard&#13;
(APMB) under MARD, which oversees project implementationof all MARD-associatedprojects funded&#13;
by international organizations. The component would finance incrementalPCU investment and&#13;
operatingcosts suchas office rental, travel, office equipment, and humanresourcesupport.&#13;

ProjectCost and Financing&#13;
&#13;
34.       Pro-iectcost. The total cost of the proposedAIERP is estimatedto be US$6.20 million'&#13;
equivalent, with a foreign exchange componentof US$4.20 million equivalent (about 70 percent), and&#13;
taxes and duties estimatedat US$0.50 million for taxes (about 8 percent) which will be financed by&#13;
Governmentcounterpartfunds.&#13;
&#13;
35.       Project financing. The total financing required is US$6.2million, of which IDA would finance&#13;
US$5 million equivalent and FA0 would finance US$0.55 million equivalent, mainly for technical&#13;
assistance andtraining. Inaddition, MARD is exploring the possibility of co-financing under the on-&#13;
going DanidaAgricultural Sector Programme Support for atotal amount of approximately US$0.45&#13;
million which would reduce the need for IDA credit accordingly. The Governmentwould finance the&#13;
balance.&#13;

  The total estimatedcost is US$8.0 million ifaUSS1.8 million JSDF Grant is included. Inthe eventthat the JSDF Grant does&#13;
  not materialize,GoV has agreedto borrow additionalUS$400,000 under the IDA Credit to finance animaldisease surveillance&#13;
  andpublic awarenesscampaignsactivities at the communitylevel, which are critical for the success of the project.&#13;
&#13;

                                                               - 7 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  36.      ComplementaryFinancing. Inaddition, on May 14,2004, the Bank applied for a JSDF Grant, in&#13;
  the amount of approximatelyUS$1.8million, to supportsmallholder recoveryfrom Avian influenzaand&#13;
  vigilance against further outbreaks. The JSDF Grant would complementthe AIERP at the local&#13;
  (communeand village) level. A final decisionfrom the GovernmentofJapanwill be made only in late&#13;
  July, following project negotiations. Inorder to meet the possiblefinancing shortfall, the Government&#13;
  has agreed to borrow from IDA an additional US$0.40million (which increases the total to&#13;
  US$5 million) to finance animal disease surveillance and public awareness campaignsat the community&#13;
  level, which are regardedas critical for the project as a whole. Inthe event that the JSDF Grant is&#13;
  approved, this amount would be cancelledor reallocatedto other activities as mutually agreed.&#13;
&#13;
  37.      One of the main objective of the JSDF Grant is to support selected smallholder farmers who&#13;
  suffered heavy losses from the avian influenza epidemic and were not compensated with the provision of&#13;
  replacementpoultry. This SmallholderPoultry RestockingComponentinvolves the utilization of grant&#13;
  funds, to be usedas seed money to restock householdsin some of the 10 project provinces and, if&#13;
  warranted, in some non-project provinces. Eachbeneficiary would receive, in-kind packages of young&#13;
  poultry or ducklings of a size commensurate with local needs and conditions. The Vietnam Women's&#13;
  Union(VWU) and DARDwould select the beneficiaries on the basis of livelihood lost during the AI&#13;
  outbreak without havingreceivedother forms of compensation. VWU and DARD would also provide&#13;
  poultry management training. The procurementof poultry would be managedby DA and implemented&#13;
  by NIAHand GeneralLivestock Company. Poultry would be purchasedfrom AI-free suppliers, certified&#13;
. by DAH. Poultry would be distributed with support from the Vietnam Women's Union (VWU) which&#13;
  has considerableprior experience inthe distribution of poultry in6 ofthe 10project provinces. The&#13;
  component is divided into two set of activities: US$l,OOO,OOO for the grant programand funds for the&#13;
  identification ofbeneficiaries,training andtechnical support and monitoring ofthe grant program.&#13;

           IV. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTSAND PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  ProjectOrganizationandManagement&#13;
&#13;
  38.      Oversight, Coordination and Monitoring of Project Activities. The existing National Steering&#13;
  Committee (NSC) for Avian Influenza Control, chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural&#13;
  Development,will provide generalpolicies and guidelines to project implementation,review annual&#13;
  work plans, and ensure coordination and linkageswith relevant agencies. The NSC is composed of&#13;
  humanhealth andveterinary agencies taskedwith overseeingnationalAI control and eradication&#13;
  operations. Inaddition, Donor coordination is critical for emergencyoperations and would bethe&#13;
  responsibility of the International Support Group (ISG) SecretariatinMARD.&#13;
&#13;
  39.      The National Project Coordination Unit(PCU) ofthe on-going IDA-fundedAgricultural&#13;
  Diversifcation Project will be responsible, under the overall guidance ofthe NSC, for day-to-day&#13;
  implementation, supervision, and project monitoring. The PCUwill be strengthenedby the recruitment&#13;
  of additional staff responsible for overall administration, procurement, and financial management of the&#13;
  project. It is agreed that at leastone senior officer from eachDAH, DA, andNAEC will be secondedto&#13;
  the PCUto guideproject implementation. These officers could be appointedas Project Coordinators in&#13;
  charge of the respectivecomponentfor which their line agency is responsible. The PCU, under the&#13;
  direction of the NSC, will be responsible for coordinating with DAH, DA, NCAE and other institutions&#13;
  to guide andmonitor project implementation at the provincial and local levels. Detailed implementation&#13;
  arrangements at the central and provincial levels are presented inAppendix 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Accounting, Financial Reportingand Audit Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
40.     Financial Management Assessment. An assessment o f the PCU's financial management capacity&#13;
has been carried out. It has been agreed that the PCU will operate the project's financial management&#13;
system to facilitate the project's implementationstart-up as it is familiar with the Bank's policies and&#13;
procedures on financial management. A US Dollar Special Account will be opened at a commercial bank&#13;
acceptable to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
41.     The project will produce a quarterly financial managementreport (FMR). Inaddition, financial&#13;
reports between the PCU and PPIUs will be reconciled prior to the preparation of the FMR. Project&#13;
accounts will be audited by a recognized independentauditor. The IDA share of eligible expenditures&#13;
incurred by the PPrUs will be pre-financed by the government and reimbursed from special account upon&#13;
submission o f approved expenditure documentation. In addition, a project financial management manual&#13;
acceptable to IDA will be prepared and adopted by the project prior to effectiveness. Fulldetails o f&#13;
financial management arrangements are found inAppendix 9.&#13;
&#13;
RetroactiveFinancing&#13;
&#13;
42.     Retroactive financing of up to US$0.3 million may be made for eligible expenditures incurred&#13;
after May 15,2004 and prior to the day o f effectiveness. This provision would allow the project to&#13;
strengthensurveillance activities at atime when the riskof resurgenceofthe disease is high. The&#13;
Borrower is aware o f the conditions for retroactive financing and o f the risks associatedwith any&#13;
payments made inexpectation of retroactive financing, provisional agreementwhich does not commit the&#13;
Bank to making a loan for the operation or to financing such payments.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement&#13;
&#13;
43.     Procurement Capacitv Assessment. An assessment o f the procurement capacity of the AIERP&#13;
PCUwas conducted as part o f the appraisal mission and the capacity was found to be adequate. The&#13;
PCU is fully functional and staffed with procurement staff having adequateprocurement experience&#13;
gained over the last five years of implementation o f the Agricultural DiversificationProject.&#13;
Procurement risks and corrective measures have beenidentified and are presented inAppendix 8.&#13;
&#13;
44.     Procurement Methods and Procurement Plan. The emergency nature of the project requires the&#13;
use o f methods that would allow procurement to be conducted inthe shortest possible time while still&#13;
ensuringareasonable degree ofcompetition andtransparency. Giventhe smallvalue andnature of&#13;
procurement packages, the proposed methods include shopping, procurement from specialized UN&#13;
agencies, direct contracting, individual consultants, least cost and consultant's qualification in&#13;
accordance with the provisions o f the Bank Procurement Guidelines and Consultant Guidelines,April&#13;
2004. A procurement plan was developed by MARDduringthe appraisal and has been finalized and&#13;
agreed upon duringthe Negotiations (see Appendix 8).&#13;
&#13;
Environmentaland SocialAspects&#13;
&#13;
45.     The project i s designed to assist with recovery o f the poultry subsector in an environmentally and&#13;
socially sustainable manner. For an emergency credit operation such as this, with insufficient time for&#13;
preparingdetailed studies incorporatingenvironmental and social safeguards, mainstreaming social and&#13;
environmentalaspects inproject design itself is the preferred approach. The project would have a&#13;
positive impact on environmental health, reducingthe risks to laboratory staff by improvingthe safety o f&#13;
handling and testing AI sampling at four provincial and two national laboratories that are currently&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

engaged insuchwork. The project's assistance to MARDto develop a strategy for managingfuture A I&#13;
outbreaksprovides an opportunity to ensure environmentaland social sustainability, intwo areas: (a)&#13;
mainstreamingenvironmentalsafeguards into protocolsandprocedures for the culling and disposalof&#13;
animals during an outbreak, inparticular by adoptingOIE (World Organizationfor Animal Health)&#13;
standards inthese areas; and (b) development ofGoV's policy on compensationfor poultry farmers&#13;
affectedby future outbreaks. For each ofthese activities (upgrading laboratory safety and efficiency and&#13;
developingthe strategy for future A I outbreaks), the project would enable the adoption and use of OIE&#13;
standards. The project includes technical assistance deliveredby FA0 for achievingthese standards. A&#13;
more detaileddescriptionof environmentaland social aspects is presentedinAppendix 10.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ProjectBenefits&#13;
&#13;
46.     The recent A I epidemic has beena financial disaster for Vietnam's commercial poultry industry&#13;
andhas also affectedthe livelihood ofmillions of smallholder poultry-keepers. Of atotal of around 12&#13;
million farming householdsit is estimatedthat over 70% keep poultry, constituting an especially&#13;
important source of householdcash income, especially for women. Moreover, many households inurban&#13;
andperi-urban'areasraise 15-20backyardpoultry which provides 7% of cash income for the poorest&#13;
quintileof households6.&#13;
&#13;
47.     The main benefitsto the national economy would be the restorationof productive assets and&#13;
economic activities, mainly inrural areas, through: (a) the rehabilitation ofthe poultry subsector which&#13;
was severely affectedby the epidemic; (b) the strengtheningof Vietnam's animal disease surveillance&#13;
system, both public and private, and diagnostic capacity, to identify at the earliest time new PA1&#13;
outbreaks; and (c) the provision of information on infectious animal disease outbreaks and advice on&#13;
animal healthand safety to extension staff, poultry producers andthe generalpublic.&#13;
&#13;
48.     Project beneficiarieswill include those poultry farmers andtraders who lost their poultry or&#13;
ducks as the result of the AI epidemic, and otherswho are protectedagainst such losses infuture. Other&#13;
direct benefits include upgradingnational diagnostic capacity by supportingnational and four regional&#13;
veterinary diagnostic laboratories with equipmentand training, stocking 12Grand-Parent (GP) poultry&#13;
breedingfarms with replacement GP poultry stock, providing increasedbio-security, and institutional&#13;
strengtheningofMARDthrough the conduct of strategic studies and surveys.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectRisks&#13;
&#13;
49.     Project risksinthe implementation of short-termemergency recovery operations often tend to be&#13;
substantial, and should be dealt with thoughtfully to mitigate as much as possible. The following&#13;
potential risks exist inthe implementation ofAIERP:&#13;

        the agencies responsiblehavehadtime to prepare an adequateemergency responseplan, which&#13;
        would overtake the timetablefor startingthe proposedproject. The ongoingFAO/TCP, now&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             A. PROJECTDESIGNCONSIDERATIONS&#13;
&#13;
1.       As an emergency recoveryproject, the proposedAIERP must respondto three criteria. Itmust&#13;
be (a) simple and flexible indesign, (b) ableto disbursequickly, and(d) avoid addressingprevailing&#13;
institutional matters.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Design simplicity is an issue inaveterinary services systemwhich requires strengtheningon&#13;
many fronts, and which is constrainedby gaps incentral-provincial government coordination. Specific&#13;
task implementationassigned to each of the project line agencies, without forging unnecessary,&#13;
complicated linkages, may avoid this constraintinthe short run, but will not suffice over the longer term.&#13;
 The limitedcommunications betweencentralandprovincial entities poses a specialproblem for rapid&#13;
upstreamanddownstreamfield surveillance information flows. Byworking through the four Regional&#13;
Veterinary Centers (RVCs) that will be upgradedfor field surveillance, which inturn report to their&#13;
northern (NVDC/Hanoi) and southern(HCMC) laboratories,the constraint of coordinating with the 10&#13;
project provinceswill be avoided.&#13;
&#13;
3.       DesignFlexibility is best achievedthrough an open-ended project design, under which blocks of&#13;
the project credit/grantwould be assigned, under anagreedtimeframe, to groupsof activities andrelated&#13;
procurement. The project would, ineffect, be designedas its lifespan progresses, with clearances&#13;
obtained for (unforeseen) activities as they arose. The ProcurementPlanplays an important role inthe&#13;
open-endedapproach. This design would also lend itselfto addressingthe eventuality that renewed&#13;
outbreakstook place inunforeseenplaces during project implementation, so that standbyproject funds&#13;
could be releasedquickly to quellsuch outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;
4.       RapidProcurementandDisbursement is of paramountimportanceina successful emergency&#13;
project intervention, and often posesthe greatest constraint. Thereforethe entire incrementalPCU&#13;
structure for the proposedproject would be appointed'andinplace before effectiveness, to beginwork on&#13;
the necessaryprocurementschedules. Inparticular, anexperiencedprocurementofficer, to be funded&#13;
under FAO/TCP, has beenhiredto assist the PCUto preparedetailed procurementplans for 2004 and&#13;
2005, finalizing procurementguidelines to be includedinthe PIM, and completing key bidding&#13;
documents.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Avoiding;existing;institutional constraints is perhaps the most challenging issue to deal with,&#13;
especially where such constraints may play a significant role insuccessful implementation. The rather&#13;
rigid, centralizedcommandstructure of MARD can make rapid implementationdifficult, unless&#13;
disbursementproceduresare streamlined. Suchan arrangement is crucial for the rapid implementationof&#13;
the project, under which US$6.2 million hasto be disbursedover two years, with at least 75%&#13;
disbursementby the end of December 2005.&#13;

&#13;
1.         Poultrv Subsector Structure. Poultryrepresentsthe secondmost importantsource of meat inthe&#13;
Vietnamese diet. Poultryproductioninvolvesthree co-existingproductionsystems: free-range&#13;
scavenger, semi-intensive and industrial. Approximately 70% ofthe totalpoultry populationis kept by&#13;
smallholder householdsthat produceabout 60% ofthe total broilerchicken, under free-range scavenger&#13;
or semi-intensive management. Typically, each smallholder owns 10-20free-range chickens or ducks&#13;
andsells a birdoccasionallyto meet cash or domestic needs. Insemi-intensive productionsystems, a&#13;
specialized grower typically raises 50-1,000 birds in simple housingand/or enclosures, provides partially&#13;
compoundedfeed and, insome cases, vaccinationagainst the mainpoultrydiseases. Finally, industrial&#13;
productioninvolvesflocks o ftens o fthousandsof fowl raisedunder total confinementconditionsand&#13;
providedwith fully compoundedfeeds, vaccinationandveterinarysupervision.&#13;
&#13;
2.         Upuntilthe 1980~~industrialpoultry enterprises inVietnamwere state-owned. Since the&#13;
                                  all&#13;
late-1980s severalprivate smallto medium-sizedjoint ventures, oftenwith foreignparticipation,have&#13;
beenestablished, with smallfarmers to produceeggs andbroilersfor the domestic market'. The&#13;
appearanceof foreigninvestors with advancedtechnology andmarketingskills ledto a decrease in&#13;
market share ofthe state-ownedcompanies from an estimated36% in 1995to 15% in 19992. Production&#13;
has increasedby an averageof 5% annuallyover the last decadebut is facingdifficulty inkeepingup&#13;
with the growthindemand. Long-termmarketpricetrends inVietnamthus show poultrymeat becoming&#13;
more expensive thanpork. Domesticdemandgrowthremains so dynamic that there is little prospect of&#13;
Vietnambecominganet exporter ofpoultryproducts duringthe next decade.                      .&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
3.       HighlyPathogenic Avian Influenza(HPAI). The severe form of avian influenza, termedhighly&#13;
pathogenic (HPAI), is one of the two most destructive diseases o f poultry and other domestic and wild&#13;
fowl, with flock mortality o f upto 100% inthe case of the H5N1 subtype. Additional, adverse economic&#13;
impacts result from trading restrictionsand embargoes placed on infected areas and the public health&#13;
implications. HPAIis recognized as a World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) List-AReportable&#13;
Disease. Followingthe regional SARS human health scare prior to the HPAIepidemic, the AI outbreaks&#13;
caused at least 23 human deaths and a much larger number o f suspectedinfections, and raised fears&#13;
among the general public of Vietnam and the region. H5N1 avian influenza virus currently has only a&#13;
limitedability to infect humans but their continued circulation increasesthe possibility they might&#13;
combine with human influenza virus strains and acquire the potentialto trigger an extremely virulent&#13;
human influenza pandemic. This has helpedto focus international concern on the regional epidemic.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Preliminarv Damage Estimates. Giventhe very rapid spread o fthe epidemic throughout&#13;
Vietnam, which caught the country's animal health services off-guard, the full extent of damage,&#13;
although difficult to gauge accurately, has been a major setback to the poultry industryand has affected&#13;
the livelihood oftens ofthousands ofsmallholders. Inadditionto public health concerns, control and&#13;
eradication o f HPAIis o f major socio-economic importance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              C. ECONOMIC IMPACT&#13;
&#13;
5.       One method o f assessingthe cost o f the recent avian influenza epidemic is by consideringthe&#13;
estimated contribution of the livestock and the poultry sub-sectors to the national product (GDP).&#13;
According to Vietnam's preliminary national accounts, the estimated value-added by poultry-raising in&#13;
2002 was VND3,700 billion (US$232 milli~n)~constant 1994 prices, equivalent to 1.2 percent o f&#13;
                                                          in&#13;
GDP. This means that ifpoultry productionfell to zero for a period o fthree months, the direct loss o f&#13;
income would have amounted to around VND1,600 billion (US$107 milli~n)~.                         The massive culling&#13;
program requiredto eradicate the disease has resultedin losseswell beyondthose producers actually&#13;
affected by the disease. A preliminary assessment inthe three provinces o f Vinh Phuc, HaThai and Thai&#13;
Binhindicates that ofthe total pre-outbreak poultry populationof25 millionbirds, 22% were culled of&#13;
which 80% were healthy birds and 20% were either diseased or had died o f AI. Apparently, many&#13;
farmers voluntarily killedtheir birds upon hearingthe news that the disease could be fatal to humans.&#13;
The OIErequirement that all birdsbe destroyed within a 3 kmradius o fthe infectedsource further&#13;
contributed to the massive overkill.&#13;
&#13;
6.       An alternative methodto assessthe cost ofthe epidemic is to estimate the direct loss inpoultry&#13;
production and sales5,the loss o f income by feed suppliersand poultry traders, and the real cost to the&#13;
government of controlling the epidemic. An estimated 44 million birds are reportedto have been culled.&#13;
 Ifthe averagefarm gatepriceofachickenbeforeAIwas VND20,000, the grossvalue ofpoultry lost in&#13;
the crisis would amount to some VND800 billion. According to some observed, losses o f income in&#13;
relatedupstream (e.g. feed and drugsupply) and downstream (Le. wholesale and retail distribution)&#13;
activities could have been as highas VND600 billion; almost as highas those sustained by poultry&#13;
farmers themselves. Containing the AI epidemic is roughly estimated to have cost the Government about&#13;
&#13;
  Equivalentto 17% of the total value of livestockproduction, which was about 6% of GDP.&#13;
  Since the crisis was short-livedthere were only limited substitutioneffects on agriculturalproductione.g. from poultry into pig&#13;
  productionor other on-farmactivities.&#13;
  Includingloss o fsales during the 3-monthmoratoriumon restocking.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
VND400 billion for the hireoftemporary laborfor cullingandclean-upcrews, overtime for policeand&#13;
other officials inthe provinces, andhire oftransportationandpurchase of importedmaterials. Thus the&#13;
totaleconomic cost ofthe January-MarchAI outbreak is very tentatively estimated, usingthis approach,&#13;
to be aroundVND1,SOO billion (US$l20million), or 0.3% of GDP. This is close to the estimate reached&#13;
by the macro-economicmethod, but somewhat lower than some earlier estimates7,madewhen the&#13;
epidemic was still raging, whichpositedpossible SARS-type effects onthe tourist industry. Such&#13;
secondary effects seemto havebeenavoided: obviously,they wouldhave madethe economic cost much&#13;
higher.&#13;
&#13;
7.        The distributionofthis cost throughout the populationis nottotally clear, since data are lacking&#13;
on the incidence ofthe HPAIepidemic amongdifferenttypes o f poultry producer. There are some&#13;
indicationsthat the semi-intensive smallholder poultryunits(keeping 50 to 1,000 birds) were hardesthit&#13;
by the disease. However the cullingcampaignsandmarketshut-downshit all producers, including&#13;
smallholderowners offree-range scavenger chickens. Incomefrom sellingpoultryandeggs is more&#13;
significantamongthe poorest quintileofthe population, inwhich households derive an averageof 7.1%&#13;
o f total cash income from this source.' Poor consumers inparticularsuffereda loss as a result of the&#13;
absence of poultrymeat andeggs fromthe market andthe 30-40% temporary increase inprice of&#13;
substituteproducts duringthis period. Although at the time ofthe missionmarketprices for poultryand&#13;
other meats onthe mainretail markets appearedto bereturningto close to pre-AIlevels, the possibility&#13;
o f shortages and further pricespikes shouldnot be excluded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 D. CONCLUSION&#13;
&#13;
8.     The distributionalimpact also depends on the compensationpolicythat will eventuallybe&#13;
implementedby the Government. The planis that all owners ofpoultrydestroyedby AI or culledwill&#13;
receivea compensationof VND5,OOO per adultbirdor VND2,000 per immaturebirdg.Insome cases&#13;
several provinces have electedto top-up this amount by another VND10,OOO. For poultryfarmers, the&#13;
amount o f compensationactuallyreceiveddependson where they live andwhen they actually receive&#13;
payment. It appears that insuch matters considerable flexibility of interpretationis leftto the provinces.&#13;
It is importantfor future controlof HPAIthat the Government's compensationscheme be implemented&#13;
fairly andpromptly.&#13;
&#13;
9.     Inconclusion, as longas the recentepidemic does notrecur, the overalleconomic impactmayhave&#13;
cost VietnambetweenVND1,500 and 1,800 billion (US$lOO-120 million), or an estimated 0.3% of GDP.&#13;
Evenat this highcost, the economic impactwas less serious than first estimated becausethe epidemic&#13;
was containedmore quicklythan many observersthought possible anddid not requireculling of entire&#13;
poultry flocks, except ina few limitedareas. However, it appears that loss of incomemay havebeen&#13;
absolutelyandrelativelymore serious for the specializedproducers, especially semi-intensivebackyard&#13;
producers.&#13;

                                           A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
1.       Since the Governmentof Vietnam first declaredthe presence of highly pathogenicavian&#13;
influenza (HPAI), an estimated44 million poultry have either died of the disease or have been culled for&#13;
reasons of disease control or economics. Lacking the necessary fine-tuned emergency disease response&#13;
plans, surveillance systems, diagnostic capacity and data analysis capability to deal with the outbreak by&#13;
means of selective, strategic containment,the Governmentadopteda policy of depopulatinglarge areas&#13;
inwhich both infectedandnon-infectedpoultry were culled. All poultry movementwas halted, live-&#13;
poultry marketswere closedand stringent disinfection andother biosecurity measures were introduced.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Since,early March2004, these control measures have been relaxedon a province-by-province&#13;
basis whenever it is observedthat 30 days have elapsed since the last outbreak. It is unlikely, however,&#13;
despite the presentdisappearance of the disease, that the virus has beentotally eliminated from the&#13;
country. It is inthis period of renewedactivity, andparticularly when restockingof infected areas is&#13;
allowed to start that the veterinary and other supportingforces of Government must be particularly alert&#13;
to any re-emergence of the infection. To permit early warning of, to limit, andto be able to quickly&#13;
contain any resurgence of HPAIthe Governmentis refining its National Action Planand has issued&#13;
preliminary guidelines (see below). For this plan to be effective it must rapidly strengthen its diagnostic&#13;
and surveillance capacities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     B. NATIONAL ACTION PLAN&#13;
&#13;
3.      The National Action Plan (NAP), preparedand promulgatedby the Departmentof Animal Health&#13;
(DAH) andsignedinto Decree by the Government, forms the framework on which the national AI&#13;
control strategy is basedand was promulgatedofficially on 18 March 2004. The NAP guidelines&#13;
outlined below describe indetail the actions to be taken during the recovery period, before restockingis&#13;
to commence.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The NAP, inaddition to the existing regulationsfor dealingwith outbreaksof AI as set out in&#13;
BNN/TY of 5* February 2004, will assist inthe timely and economic recovery of the poultry sub-sector&#13;
to normal healthand function. These guidelineswere issued for the attention of all divisions ofthe&#13;
DAH, the Sub-departments ofAnimal Health (SDAH) ineach Province, District andCommune, andall&#13;
poultry producersand local administrations. The project will assist the Governmentinrefining the NAP&#13;
and indevelopinga comprehensiveNational EmergencyContingencyPlan for HPAI.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Insummary, the currentNAP providesguidanceon "Inspection andHygiene Conditions to be&#13;
Applied inthe RecoveryPeriod": (a) ininfected areas, includingthe use of sentinel flocks infarms&#13;
originally holdingmore than 500 birds; and (b) inbreedingfarms supplying day-old chicks or eggs for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   -19-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
hatchingwill be subject to routine serum samplingof their flocks.&#13;
&#13;
6.       The Regional Veterinary Centers (RVC) are responsiblefor the collection of samples from the&#13;
state-ownedfarms andjoint-venture farms, while the Provincial sub-DepartmentsofAnimal Health will&#13;
be responsiblefor collecting the samples from all private farms and holdings involved, and delivering&#13;
them, inproper andtimely manner, to their RVC for testing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          C. SUPPORTPROPOSEDUNDER THE PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
7.       The AIERP would support five areas of activity:&#13;
&#13;
    b    Strengthendisease surveillance from commune to central level, to encourage rapid detectionof&#13;
         any new cases that may occur and assist ina swift responseto contain any new outbreaks;&#13;
&#13;
    b    Upgradethe diagnostic capacity at the NVDC national diagnostic laboratory inHanoi and four&#13;
         RVCs (Can Tho, Ho Chi MinhCity, DaNangandVinh), to enhance the capability o fthe&#13;
         veterinary service to accuratelydiagnose HPAI;&#13;
&#13;
    b    Establisha Virus Reference Laboratory (VRL) underNIVRto conduct researchandtyping of A I&#13;
         and other pathogenicviruses, to establishvirus prevalencepatterns andpathogenicityandto&#13;
         assist MARD inthe designand implementationof adequate control and eradicationstrategies;&#13;
&#13;
    b    Conduct two strategic studies onthe preparationof aNational EmergencyContingency Planfor&#13;
         HPAI, including an updateofthe National Action Planto control AIEpidemic, anda self-&#13;
         evaluationofVeterinary Services; and&#13;
&#13;
    b    Develop EmergencyOutbreak ContainmentPlanfor three provinces, under which disinfectants,&#13;
         transport, manpower and other necessary resources can be made available rapidly to reachan&#13;
         infected are and institute containment.&#13;
&#13;
SubcomponentA.l- StrengtheningAnimalDiseaseSurveillance&#13;
&#13;
8.       The subcomponentwill supportthe following activities.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Improving information flow. DAHintends to develop an areanetwork to facilitate the monthly&#13;
transmissionof disease report data from the Provinces, using the modified TAD info-reportingsystem&#13;
createdfor DAHunder the SVSV project for routine and emergencydisease reporting. The AIERP&#13;
would supportthe costs of the requisite computerizationofthe Provincial Offices, preparationof&#13;
manualsandtraining o f staff.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Detection, reporting and follow-up of suspect cases. By far the most frequent interaction with&#13;
farmers i s provided by commune level animal healthworkers, who have beenmobilized during the&#13;
epidemic as communeAIteams. They are essentially private practitioners although some receive&#13;
monthly allowancesfrom the governmentand participate inpreparationofmonthly disease reports. The&#13;
quality of disease surveillanceprovided by these workers is very variable, and it can be difficult for them&#13;
to raise an alert when a notifiable disease is suspected. The proposedproject activity will support efforts&#13;
to improve their effectiveness:&#13;
&#13;
         Communitv-basedSurveillanceNetworks. At the community level, an early warning system will&#13;
         be establishedto support a robustemergencyreporting and feedback system againstnotifiable&#13;
         diseases. A critical objective ofthis sub-component will be to improve the commitment of all&#13;
         participantsto the "epidemiological surveillancenetworks". Veterinarianswithout Borders&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    -20-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        (VSF) andthe National InstituteofAnimal Husbandry(NIAH)have establishedandtested since&#13;
        June 2002 two pilot epidemio-surveillance networksat the district level intwo provinces. Both&#13;
        schemes focus on skills development, but neither scheme hasyet addressedthe issue of rapid&#13;
        emergencyreporting for notifiable diseasesandthis element will needto be built inunder the&#13;
        presentproject. The project will supporttraining for animalhealthworkers, andthe treatment of&#13;
         infected animals andreporting procedures. Farmerswill receivehands-ontraining indetection&#13;
        ofclinical signs. The project will provide basic bio-security equipmentsuch as sprayers,&#13;
        protective equipment, inplaces where this has not already beensuppliedunder other emergency&#13;
        response programs.&#13;
&#13;
    0   Public Veterinaw SurveillanceNetworks. The proposedproject will also help strengthenthe&#13;
         linksbetweenDistrict Veterinary Stations,private veterinary andparaveterinarypractitioners,&#13;
        andproducer associations. Itwill support samplingand laboratory testing inthe event ofa&#13;
        suspected case. Inthe event of a suspected outbreak, rapid access will be provided to an&#13;
        emergency disease control fund by a procedurethat is consistent across provinces. The AIERP&#13;
        will also supportthe continuation of incrementaltravel costs, to enable structuredand&#13;
        conscientiousmonitoring at commune level. Itwill also be importantto seek a mechanismfor&#13;
        continuingto fund an increasedveterinary presence at the commune level, since this will be&#13;
        important to the success ofthe community level networks. The project will also finance a&#13;
        vehicle for DAHfield surveillanceand coordination, the preparationand distribution of&#13;
        operatingmanualsandthe training of field staff. Clearly, there is an important needfor training&#13;
         inthe various aspects of inspection, disease recognition, anddifferential diagnosis; and in&#13;
         swabbing, bleeding, handling, recording, storing andtransportingsamples for laboratory&#13;
        diagnosis. Training of Trainers' (TOT) courses could first be organizedwith staff ofthe&#13;
        RegionalVeterinary Centers (RVCs), these staffwould then go on to train -on a province by&#13;
        province basis -selected provincial and district staff, and possibly even some ofthe private&#13;
         sector veterinarians animal healthtechnicians operatingat commune level.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Routine SerologicalSurvevs andEpidemio-Surveillance. Activities to be supportedby the&#13;
proposedproject include:(a) sero surveillance, to assess whether disease freedom has been achievedand&#13;
preferably prior to restocking. The project will support collecting andtesting of samples and feedbackto&#13;
farmers; (b) sampling, of"survivors", through randomserological/cloacalsamplingdone on wild birds&#13;
and poultry surviving inand arounddepopulatedareas to confirm whether any active virus remains inthe&#13;
area, prior to them beingallowed to restock; (c) market inspections, inaddition to the routine inspection&#13;
of markets andthe check-pointinspectionscurrently active on the roads, some randomswabbingof&#13;
poultry -particularly of breeds usedinextensive production systems -will be done at the major&#13;
wholesalemarkets; and(c) monitoring,of farms. The 12MARD-operated GP poultry breedingfarms&#13;
would be monitored and regular field S&amp;Mwould be implementedinthe service areas surroundingthe&#13;
RVC laboratories indicated. The detail cost ofthe sub-component is presentedinTable 101 of Costab.&#13;
&#13;
SubcomponentA.2 -UpgradingDiagnostic Laboratory Capacity&#13;
&#13;
12.      Inorder to support the programofsero surveillanceoutlined above andto provide rapidand&#13;
accurateresponse to suspectedHPAIcases, the National Veterinary Diagnostic Center (NVDC) inHanoi&#13;
and four RVCs (Ho Chi MinhCity, DaNang, Can Tho andVinh) will be provided with essential&#13;
equipment and training that have not been provided by other sources. The detail cost of the sub-&#13;
component is presentedinTable 102of Costab.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Equipment. The proposedproject will finance the purchaseof equipments for NVDC and four&#13;
RVCs. A list has beenpreparedby FA0 specialists and will be refined prior to project effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   - 21 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14.      Training,and TechnicalAssistance. Staff of the project-supportedlaboratorieswill receive&#13;
trainingrefreshertraining inthe accurate andefficient conduct, calibration, andtroubleshootingof&#13;
various diagnostic HPAItests. Since there will be a very considerablevolume of important samplingand&#13;
testingto be done during the next three to six months, and since it is vital that these tests are up and&#13;
runningbeforethe second wave of A I outbreaksemerges during the restockingphase, DAHwill invite&#13;
the assistanceofexperiencedlaboratorytechnologiststo provide on-the-jobtraining andsupportto the&#13;
staff of the HanoiNVDC and the 4 project RVCs.&#13;
&#13;
Subcomponent A.3 Veterinary ReferenceLaboratoryfor HPAI research&#13;
                     -&#13;
&#13;
15.      The NIVRVeterinarv Reference Laboratory (VRL). The proposedproject will supportNIVRin&#13;
strengtheningHPAIresearchto include laboratorycapacity to performtyping ofthe Nantigen of the&#13;
Avian Influenza virus (it can already do Htyping) usingthe neuraminidasetest. Project funds will be&#13;
usedto equip the VRL andtrain VRL staff accordingly. ConstructionofVRL, will be carried out with&#13;
Governmentcounterpartfunds and is not included inthe project. However, the VRL would be&#13;
constructedat internationally acceptablestandards, to be monitored by project-supportedFA0 experts.&#13;
The sponsoringagency NIVRwill provide the Bank with assurances that construction at acceptable&#13;
standards will be undertaken. The Project will not finance facilities and equipmentto be usedfor live&#13;
animal pathogenicitytesting. The detail cost of the sub-componentis presentedinTable 103 of Costab.&#13;
&#13;
Subcomponent A.4 -Strategic Studies&#13;
&#13;
16.      Two strategic studies will be carried out under this subcomponent: (a) the preparationof a&#13;
National EmergencyContingencyPlan for HPAI, including an updateof the National Action Planto&#13;
control A I Epidemic; and (b) a self-evaluationofveterinary services, following OIE standards on quality&#13;
and evaluationofveterinary services. To meet internationalrequirements, veterinary services needto&#13;
develop and document appropriate proceduresand standards for the implementationand management of&#13;
animal healthmeasures and international veterinary certification activities. Detailedterms ofreference&#13;
are being preparedand will be included inthe PIM. These studies would be financedby the FAO/TCP.&#13;
The detail cost ofthe sub-component is presentedinTable 104ofCostab.&#13;
&#13;
SubcomponentA.5 -EmergencyOutbreakContainmentPlan&#13;
&#13;
17.      The preparationof an EmergencyOutbreakContainment Plan, comprising a rapid mobilization&#13;
planto respondquickly and effectively to recurring A I outbreaks inthree project or non-project&#13;
provinces duringthe project lifespan. The Plan, to be developedby DAHandDA, would contain&#13;
guidelines for the rapid activation ofphysical and humanresources to respondquickly to an outbreak.&#13;
Physicalresources, supportedby project funds, would comprise farm and burial disinfectants, sprayers&#13;
andprotective clothing. Humanresourceswould entail the identification of, and project-supported&#13;
contingency allowances for, of persons to be activated, incase of need. The detail cost ofthe sub-&#13;
component is presentedinTable 105 of Costab.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                        D. RISKASSESSMENT&#13;
&#13;
18.      The key risks involved in implementing this Componentare:&#13;
&#13;
    0    Delayedarrival ofthe requisite equipment and training, after the secondwave of disease will&#13;
         have once more overwhelmedDAHresources. However, the DAH'Splan to delay restockingfor&#13;
         three monthsgives some respite, andthe FA0 TCPs shouldalso have got some key initiatives&#13;
         underway by then;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    - 22 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   0 Lack of incentive for field staff to properly conductthe immediateand future surveillance&#13;
     programs proposed. The proposedsupport to operationalcosts inrespect of supplementationof&#13;
     travel allowances, should act as an attractiveincentiveto participate;&#13;
&#13;
   0 Time neededto establishand oDerationalisethe commune level surveillance networks. The&#13;
     increasedveterinary manpowerresources requiredto initiate this activity, as well as for the sero-&#13;
     surveillanceto be funded underthe AIERP, will allow a heightenedlevel of vigilance to continue&#13;
     while the capacity of animalhealthworkers and farmers is developed;&#13;
&#13;
   0 Reluctanceto announce suspectednew outbreaks. For various understandablereasons, there can&#13;
     be unwillingness to raise the alarm about HPAI, and delay inreporting allows the disease to&#13;
     spread. However, the appraisalmission was encouragedby the fact that a suspectedoutbreak&#13;
     during its stay inVietnam was reportedquite quickly inthe national press;&#13;
&#13;
   0 Inabilitv ofthe laboratoriesto coDe with the peakdemands for serologicaltests. As yet, the&#13;
     volume of blood samples to behandledhas not been quantified. However, once trained and&#13;
     familiar with the ELISA procedures, a laboratorytechnician shouldbe able to cope with 1,800&#13;
     samples a day, usingthe equipmentto be provided. With 4 RVCs andthe NVDC fully activated,&#13;
    this could equate to about 270,000 samples a month, which shouldbe sufficient capacity; and&#13;
&#13;
   0 RiskofReintroduction ofthe Disease. Other outbreakscould either arise from within the&#13;
     country or from outsidethe country, either by importation of poultry or from wild birds.&#13;
     Thereforethe surveillancesystemneeds to be attunedto detectinginternal sources ofvirus and&#13;
     preventingthe disease from spreadingout from a newly introducedsource.&#13;
&#13;
19.  Issues. The following issues will need to be addressedduring project implementation:&#13;
&#13;
   0 Institutional Issues. While an emergency operationdoes not intendto address long-term&#13;
     institutional aspects, there are significant structural issues that haveto be managed ifemergency&#13;
     responses to animal diseases are to be effectively implemented. Inparticular, there is a needto&#13;
     identify the institutional obstacles to effective emergencyresponse and, in the provinces where it&#13;
     will be undertaken, findways of modeling a workable solution. These questionswill be&#13;
     addressedwhen designingthe contingency emergency plan for HPAI. Most contingency plans&#13;
     are outcome oriented, and are characterizedby simplicity inmanagement and authoritiesrequired&#13;
     to deliver;&#13;
&#13;
   0 Sustainabilitv Issues. The sustainability issues are linked to a long-term national strategy for&#13;
     epidemic disease control inthe poultry sector which will be supportedby the proposedproject;&#13;
     and&#13;
&#13;
   0 Information Flows. Effective information flows are critical for the success ofthe project. Every&#13;
     effort shouldbe made to ensure that the upstreamand downstreamflows of diagnostic and field&#13;
     monitoring information are set up at the earliest possible moment. The SDAHs ineach province&#13;
     will be responsiblefor this mechanism, and each SDAH shouldclearly identify a person&#13;
     responsiblefor information flow. An Information Coordinator shouldbe appointed ineach&#13;
     SDAH, with counterpartsineach RVC, who communicatesclosely with those responsiblefor&#13;
     implementingthe awareness and information campaign.&#13;

&#13;
The Extentof NationalPoultryLosses&#13;
&#13;
1.      The governmentestimates that, accordingto the most recent information,atotal of44 million&#13;
poultry diedas a resultofthe AI or were culledinpreventative measuresimplementedduringthe&#13;
outbreak. Ofthis number, the semi-intensive/backyard poultry segment lostbetweenten andfifty&#13;
percent. This suggests that somewhere between4 and 19millionbirdshave beenaffectedinthe&#13;
smallholdersector alone. Assuming an averageholdingof fifty birdsper householdbeforeAI, between&#13;
80,000 and 380,000 smallholder householdsmay havebeenaffected nationally.&#13;
&#13;
2.      There are no reliabledata as to the breakdowno fthe number of poultrythat were lost from&#13;
parentbreedingstock inmultiplierfarms inthe privateand public sectors, or ofthe proportionof broilers&#13;
lost incomparisonwith layers. The projectwill support a poultry losses survey inthe tenproject&#13;
provincesto determinethe exact causes anddistributionofpoultrylosses from the epidemic.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Recovery inthe worst hit provinces is also likely to be delayedby uncertaintyover the&#13;
resurgenceof HPAI, so that the recovery itselfwill be patchy. Day old chick (DOC) producers insome&#13;
areas will not returnto productionquickly, so that the availablesupply ofDOC for growers wishingto&#13;
restock may remainlow for sometime. Growersmay also be reluctantto restock untiltheir risk is clear,&#13;
(a) the biosecurityandAImonitoringmeasuresfor large andsmallDOC producers are inplace, (b) DOC&#13;
suppliers are registeredto producedisease-freebirds incompliancewith AI controlprocedures, and (c)&#13;

provinces. TheNIAHowns andoperates five farms (with the Thuy Phuongpoultryresearchcentre the&#13;
largest), while MARD operates sevenfacilities heldby GeneralLivestockCompanies. The variety o f&#13;
breeds o fGP poultrystock heldonthese farms is supposedly adaptedto local village conditions. The&#13;

DOC the private breedingfarms supply. NIAHestimatesthe output of parent stockfrom the state-run&#13;
farms to be somewhere between 150,000 and 180,000 DOC per year andhavingthe potential of&#13;
multiplying to 16-20 million grower DOC annually. The GP breedingstock (yellow-featheredKabir,&#13;
Sasso and Color Redbro strains) needs replacingevery two years and the parent stock eachyear ifthis&#13;
breedingresources is to remainproductive and true to type. However, it has beenfour years since&#13;
Vietnam last imported new GP stock and the genetic quality of this stock has significantly deteriorated&#13;
and is below optimal quality.&#13;
&#13;
Private Sector Involvement in the Poultry Sector&#13;
&#13;
6.      The commercial sector is dominatedby a few foreign-ownedpoultry companies. These&#13;
enterprises raise their own parentstock and supply the industry inVietnam with broiler and layer DOC,&#13;
primarily under contract growing arrangements. Farmsproducing broilers predominate,but the smaller&#13;
broiler parent farms also producetable eggs as well as grower chicks, so that the distinction betweenegg&#13;
and broiler producersinthe commercial(and state) sector is blurred. MARDreportsthat layersrepresent&#13;
no more than one quarter of all poultry kept inthe state and commercialunits. The commercialsector is&#13;
estimatedto have half a millionparent stock intotal, down 150,000 birds lost or culled due to AI, but&#13;
with an annualoutput capacity of sixty million DOC remaining. State and private units may therefore&#13;
have a combinedannualDOC capacity of about 186 millionDOC from all sources (Table 1).&#13;

Government's Emergency Response&#13;
&#13;
8.      On 3 March2004, the Office ofthe Prime Minister issued a directive inwhich a number of&#13;
recovery initiatives were suggested. The documentassigned to MARD to take the leadrole inAI&#13;

&#13;
Assessmentof the Government's CompensationPolicy&#13;
&#13;
9.       The preparationmission's assessmentofthese recovery proposalssuggests that they may be&#13;
inadequateinterms of equity and inproviding poultry raiserswith areporting incentive inthe event of&#13;
future outbreaks. The compensationpayments may inmany instances betoo little too late:13&#13;
&#13;
    e    Fullcompensationvalue for birds culled or dead from HPAIhas takenplace inonly nine most&#13;
         seriously affected province^'^. There is noprovision for paying compensationto provinces other&#13;
         than those listed;&#13;
&#13;
    e    The remaining 55 provinces are thus requiredto compensate entirely from their provincial&#13;
         disaster relieffunds from which some wealthier provinces havealready paidsome compensation&#13;
         to farmers. The provincial disaster relief funds are generally small, however, and some were&#13;
         exhaustedin financing the culling, clean-upandpolicing of markets andpoultry movement.&#13;
         Some provinceshave borrowedadditional sums to completethe work15;and&#13;
&#13;
    e    Evenwith centralbudget support, provincial governmentswould find it difficult to ensure that&#13;
         smallholdersare compensatedequitably, becausebackyardpoultry raisers, the most vulnerable of&#13;
         small-holders, have lower industry andpolitical profiles than those inthe commercialsector and&#13;
         are likelyto be left untillast.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                           B. SUPPORT PROPOSEDUNDERTHE PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
10.      The proposedproject would support the rehabilitation ofthe poultry subsector through the&#13;
following three subcomponents. The detail cost ofthe sub-componentis presentedin Table 2 of Costab.&#13;
&#13;
Subcomponent B.1- BreedingStock Supply&#13;
&#13;
I1.      Day-old chicks of improved, adapted poultry and duck breeds will become availablefrom the&#13;
Parent offspring of newly importedGP stock financed under the project, and would enter small semi-&#13;
intensive, backyardunits. Restockingis premisedon the assumptionthat enoughnative poultry breeding&#13;
stock are locally available as a source of birds for this purpose.&#13;
&#13;
12.      Semi-intensive smallholders and backyardvillage poultry raiserswill needreplacement birds as&#13;
soon as restockingbegins. NIAH(5 farms) and MARD(7 facilities, heldby the GeneralLivestock&#13;
Companies), are the repository of severalbreeds of GP poultry stock specifically adapted for village&#13;
conditions - crossbreedingwith native chickens for dual purpose scavenge raising, and small-scale, semi-&#13;
intensiveproduction. This GP stock provides the many multiplier farms of the provincial administrations&#13;
with parent birds which inturn supply smallholdersthroughout Vietnam with grower chicks.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
13.      Replacingthe existingGP birds will reinvigoratethe quality of the grower stock output, making&#13;
this an importantinitiativefor the small-scalepoultry industryover the mediumand longer term. Subject&#13;
to farmcapacity, 15,000 GP DOCSandducklingswouldbe importedto replacethe current breedersover&#13;
two years. Four years of highquality replacements for the oldparent stockheldon the provincial&#13;
multiplier farms will thenbe possible. Grower availabilityfromnewly introducedGP stock will begin&#13;
eighteenmonthsafter importation. The leadtime betweenDOC introductionandthe releaseof&#13;
significantnumbers ofgrower stock may be as longas 28 months.&#13;
&#13;
Subcomponent B.2 -Upgrading the Biosecurity of GP Facilities&#13;
&#13;
14.      Provisionwould be madefor upgradingthe biosecurityat the 12GGP andGP breedingfarms&#13;
operatedby MARD andNIAH. The Projectwill finance for eachfarm: a personneldisinfectionunit, a&#13;
quarantine unit, a clean-water system, disinfectants,sprayers, protectiveclothing, fencingandother items&#13;
essential for ensuringaneffectivedisease containmentbarrier. Furthermore,vaccination for AI would be&#13;
consideredfor all stock ofthe 12GGP andGP farms, shouldthe governmentclear the way for such&#13;
vaccination. Nationalengineeringconsultants will preparebiosecurityassessmentandconstruction&#13;
designs for each ofthe 12farms. Priorto introducingthe biosecuritypackagesfor each breedingfarm, a&#13;
biosecurityspecialistwill reviewthe assessmentandthe constructiondesignfor each GP farms to make&#13;
recommendations for improvement. Bothconsultants will be project-supported, the biosecurityspecialist&#13;
will be financedby the FA0 TCP. As a conditionalityto protectingnewly importedGP breedingstock&#13;
from infectiousdisease, includingAI, all 12project farms musthavecompletedtheir upgradingina&#13;

&#13;
15.      Biosecuritymodels for smallandmediumsize poultryfarms will also be developed under the&#13;
project(Component C) and disseminatedthroughthe publicawarenessandextension programs.&#13;
&#13;
Subcomponent B.3 - Strategic Studies&#13;
&#13;
16.      This subcomponent involvestwo strategy studies on compensationpolicy, poultry sector&#13;
restructuring,anda survey of poultry losses resultingfromthe AI epidemic. The compensationpolicy&#13;
study wouldprovidea frameworkfor an equitable nationalcompensationpolicyby whichto provide&#13;
restitutionto producersfollowing serious animaldiseaseoutbreaks. The poultrysector restructuring&#13;
study wouldprovideguidelines to better preparethe poultry sector to withstandserious disease&#13;
outbreaks. The poultry losses survey would identifythe causes ofpoultry culled, either for disease or&#13;
preventivereasons, inthe 10projectprovinces. Detailedterms ofreferenceare beingpreparedandwill&#13;
be includedinthe PIM. These studies wouldbe financedby the FAO/TCP.&#13;

&#13;
                                          A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
1.      Responsibilities for nationwide extensionand awarenessto farmers by MARD-generatedpublic&#13;
information are centered intwo institutions: the National Agricultural ExtensionCenter (NAEC) andthe&#13;
Information Center for Agricultural and Rural Development(ICARD). Establishedby Governmental&#13;
Decree as recently as July 2003, NAEC was createdto serve as a public service delivery agency under&#13;
MARD. As such, NAEC is designatedthe service provider for ComponentC andresponsiblefor its&#13;
management and implementation. The Ministerof MARD issued, on September 2003, a decree to split&#13;
the previousDepartmentofAgricultural andForestryExtensioninto the National Agricultural Extension&#13;
Center andthe Departmentof Agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
2.      NAEC is specifically responsiblefor technologytransfer and information distribution to farmers.&#13;
To carry out these tasks it collects information on the needs and wishes of farmers nationwide. NAEC&#13;
operates at the provincial level throughthe Provincial ExtensionCenters, each with about 15 staff, at the&#13;
District level as District ExtensionCenters, each with 5 to 6 staff, andat the Communelevel as&#13;
Extension Staff, usually comprising one livestock andone crop extension officer.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Public sector Extensionservices inViet Namoperate at four levels:&#13;
&#13;
    0   the centralextension institutions basedinHanoi;&#13;
&#13;
    0   the provincial extensionnetwork;&#13;
&#13;
    0   the districtnetwork; and&#13;
&#13;
    0   the grassroots or commune-levelnetwork.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Inaddition to NAEC there are private serviceproviders, includingfarmers associations, NGOs&#13;
and private volunteers, as well as the commercialpoultry farm veterinarians. NAEC now has the overall&#13;
responsibility for the planning, budgetingandmonitoring of agricultural extension services for the entire&#13;
country. The Governmentplans to recruit about 5,000 extensionpersonnelby 2005, including&#13;
substantial increases inwomen and indigenous people.&#13;
&#13;
5.      The DAHat the national andthe SDAH at provincial level, incollaboration with the NAEC&#13;
extensionnetwork, are incharge oftransferring technical and administrative information relatedto&#13;
animal healthto livestock producersand for collecting andanalyzing disease surveillancedata.&#13;
Technical information is also provided through the DAHwebsite, andthe GreenLineat National Post&#13;
Office branches. However, most ofthe animal health service linkagesremaindisconnectedandthe flow&#13;
of information is mostly top down, seriously hamperingrapid information transfer from the field to the&#13;
executingagencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   -29-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.       The important role ofthe private sector inextension mustbe emphasized, especially inon-the-&#13;
job training. For example, the CP Livestock Co. in Ho Chi MinhCity employs 50 farm veterinarians&#13;
who provide technical services alongside product promotion. These veterinarians are well trained and, in&#13;
quantity and quality, outperform the provincial veterinary services inthat area. The impact ofNGO&#13;
activities such as VSF, GRET and others, is equally important, albeit of smaller scale. The role ofNAEC&#13;
has been limited duringthe recent AI epidemic, so as the collaboration with DAHto share technical and&#13;
strategic information to prepare awareness and public information campaign.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       B. RATIONALE FOR SUPPORTINGPUBLICAWARENESSAND INFORMATION&#13;
&#13;
7.       Efforts, albeit considered rather inadequate by NAEC, were made by the extension services to&#13;
address the AI crisis by employing information and awarenesstools and materials. An analysis o f the&#13;
awareness, communicationand information process duringthe three months duringand following the&#13;
outbreak has shownthe following deficiencies:&#13;
&#13;
         poor communication betweenDAHand the provincial sub-departments, within and betweenthe&#13;
         provincial veterinary services, between field services and the laboratories, and between DAHand&#13;
         the humanhealthsector;&#13;
&#13;
         a low level o f collaboration and information sharing among DAH,NAEC and extension services,&#13;
         both at the central and field level;&#13;
&#13;
         insufficient generation and timely delivew o f rapid and reliable information to the country, using&#13;
         relevant and simple technical messages;&#13;
         a lack o f dvnamic communication links betweennational and field levels;&#13;
         a lack o f a clear national strateq of awareness and information to the farmers giventhe high&#13;
         level of risk and the economic impact, inparticular for small holders and poor people;&#13;
         an insufficientlv clear institutional communication and public information strategy by MARD&#13;
         and DAHduringthe critical phase o f the AI crisis; and&#13;
         inadequate facilities and modern communication technologies at the provincial and district levels&#13;
         to serve as efficient transmission conduits to the grassroots level.&#13;
&#13;
         The returnof further AI outbreaks is a distinct possibility', and the knowledge and awarenessof&#13;
the diseaseby farmers andpoultry owners mustbe strengthened; so too musttheir knowledge about&#13;
immediate protection measuresto safeguard human health and to stop the propagation o f the disease. A&#13;
clear awarenessstrategy and a comprehensive delivery o f extension messages would have increased the&#13;
institutional visibility of the livestock sector and strengthenedthe credibility of the national DAHAI&#13;
containment policy duringthe post-emergency period.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Such a strategy would be an important investment, basedon the lessons learned by NAEC, DAH&#13;
and MARDand by the poultry sector duringthe AI epidemic. The awareness and communication policy&#13;
o fNAEC, and the capacity by DAHto contain infectious diseaseoutbreaks, must therefore be brought in&#13;
pace with the level of the livestock and poultry development in Vietnam. Awareness and communication&#13;
strategies, drivenby DAHand implemented(at different levels) by NAEC and the MARD information&#13;
sector will serve, over the short and medium-terms, to help strengthen bothDAHand NAEC and will&#13;
contribute to more coordinated efforts inepidemio-surveillanceo ftargeted diseases inVietnam.&#13;
&#13;
' An AI outbreak ina provinceo fthe MekongDeltawas confirmed inearly May, andwas quickly controlled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     -30-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10.     The quality and efficiency o fthe two-way flow of information andthe active participation o fall&#13;
the poultry sector stakeholders are two key-points for the effective monitoringo fthe disease situation&#13;
and preventiono f a possible returno fthe epidemic inVietnam.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Awareness and Public InformationCampaign have two specific objectives:&#13;
&#13;
    0   To increasethe productionand the dissemination of technicaland informativemessages&#13;
        targeting all the stakeholders and actors of the poultry subsector, with the aim to: (a) increasethe&#13;
        basic knowledge o f farmers, poultry holders and other stakeholders inbasic animal health&#13;
        information: clinical signs, disease recognition, prevention, control of animal movements and&#13;
        markets; (b) inform poultry holders at all levels of the procedures to follow inan emergency&#13;
        alert, covering comprehensive and adaptedguidelines; (c) inform and train farmers and poultry&#13;
        smallholders in basic biosecurity measures (culling and disposal process, use o f drugs, etc.); (d)&#13;
        inform concerned stakeholders about regulations, compensation mechanisms and restocking&#13;
        process; and (e) inform the rural and urban population (including consumers) about any risks to&#13;
        humanhealth.&#13;
&#13;
    0   To strengthenthe activitiesand capacityin communicationsof DAH at the national and&#13;
        provincial levels through: (a) the establishment of an Information and Communications Task&#13;
        Group under MARD, composed ofNAEC and DAHstaff, in charge of the design and&#13;
        management o f information and communicationstrategies inthe livestock sector inaccordance&#13;
        with prevailing OIE regulations; (b) training ofNAEC and DAHstaff ininformation and&#13;
        communication management at national level; (c) scaled-uDmoduction and distribution of&#13;
        relevant informationto the population, and to DAHand the livestock sector by NAEC, with the&#13;
        technical assistance o f ICARD; and (d) training NAEC staff and AHW inthe awareness and&#13;
        communication process, methodology, and production o f informationmaterials at the provincial&#13;
        level and provision o f communications assistanceto the disease surveillance network.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                         C. COMPONENT DESCRIPTIONAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
12.     The Component has three main aims: (a) to increasethe level o f awareness oftargeted groups, to&#13;
improve the two-way flow o f information in case of recurring outbreaks, and to provide these target&#13;
groups with the necessarytechnical information; (b) to provide poultry holders and animal field workers&#13;
with the technical information to successfully undertake the restocking process whilst insuringadequate&#13;
biosecurity; and (c) to target the poultry subsector with clear and comprehensive information about&#13;
governmental compensation and restocking mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
13.     The Component supports the strengthening of the awareness campaign currently beingcarried&#13;
out by the Government and by DAH, which would be implementedby NAEC, incollaboration with the&#13;
private sector agri-business poultry enterprises. The Component comprises three subcomponents.&#13;
&#13;
Subcomponent C.1- CapacityBuildingin Communicationand Public Information&#13;
&#13;

ExpectedResults and Outputs&#13;
&#13;
17.   For the short term (emergency situation):&#13;
&#13;
   0  farmers and poultry holders have beentrained and sufficiently informed to face a possible return&#13;
      o f AI;&#13;
&#13;
   0  the poultry sector receives comprehensive guidelines for efficient reportingincase of emergency,&#13;
      and for routine surveillance;&#13;
&#13;
   0  preventiontechniques and biosecurity measuresare well understood by the populationand by the&#13;
      professional poultry sector;&#13;
&#13;
   0  consumers have been informed and are aware of the risks to humanhealth; and&#13;
&#13;
   0  packages of technical information (communication materials, printedand multimedia supports,&#13;
      etc.) are available, and documents such as posters and leaflets are widely distributedacross the&#13;
      country, with priority to the ten (10) provinces under the project.&#13;
&#13;
18.   For the medium-term(preventive situation):&#13;
&#13;
   0  animal health services at national level have been strengthened ininformation and&#13;
      communication management, human resources have been trained and technical capacities&#13;
      increased. A Task Group has been set up and is operational;&#13;
&#13;
   0  a Communication Strategy has been designed, routine technical messages have beenprepared&#13;
      and target-groups identified;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 32 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        adequate information channels and communications tools have been identified (MARD websites,&#13;
        national radio-TV broadcasting networks, printedmaterials, etc.);&#13;
&#13;
        linkages and collaboration betweenDAHand NAEC have improved and are operational;&#13;
        collaboration in producing and exchanging information is more effective;&#13;
&#13;
        communication activities are considered important inday-to-day effectiveness, and inthe&#13;
        development of the epidemio-surveillance network;&#13;
&#13;
        NAEC trainers have beentrained inawarenessand communicationat the provincial level and the&#13;
        technical capacities of DAH infield communications (within Provincial Extension Centers) have&#13;
        been increasedas well as their equipment and facilities;&#13;
        A two-way information flow is operational between AH Services at national leveland veterinary&#13;
        staff inthe Provincial Extension Services;&#13;
&#13;
        AHW have received awareness material and relevant simple methodological guidelines; and&#13;
        Packages of technical information about the main animal diseases inVietnam (AI and/or OIE&#13;
        List A) have been collected and e-formatted on CD-ROM.&#13;
&#13;
Methodologyand Key Activities&#13;
&#13;
19.     The implementationofthe Component would be achieved by: (a) strengtheningnational&#13;
capacities in informatiodcommunication within the animal health sector, inclose collaboration with the&#13;
NAEC and the extension services at the provincial level; (b) promoting exchange and collaboration&#13;
between DAHand NAEC; and (c) setting up a task-group to formulate an informatiodcommunications&#13;
strategy with informative messages.&#13;
&#13;
20.     Two workshops would be held at the national level; the first workshop at the onset of project&#13;
implementation, and the second inProject Year 2, which would teach NAEC and the Provincial&#13;
Extension Centers staff how to carry out public information and awarenessassessment inorder to&#13;
determinethe efficiency o fthe Campaignand Strategy. ICARDwould be involved to produce animal&#13;
health and livestock sector economics data and information packages for partners and trade sector.&#13;
&#13;
21,     Operationalawareness and public information capacity and methodologies at the provincial level&#13;
would be strengthenedthrough the NAEC Extension Centers. Training sessions and workshops (inthe&#13;
ProvincialExtension Centers) would be organized for agricultural and veterinary staff insix selected&#13;
provinces, on how to prepare, locally, awareness and communication materials; and to strengthen the&#13;
collaboration between agricultural awareness services and veterinary services. This methodology would&#13;
encompass two processes:&#13;
        Information Production. A process would be established to design, produce and distribute&#13;
        awarenessand public information (multimedia) materials. This would increase the level of&#13;
        public awarenessand improve the visibility and the efficiency o f the NAP.&#13;
&#13;
        Information Dissemination. A rapid dissemination process for information sharing through&#13;
        radio/TV broadcasting networks (covering 95% o f the country), and through e-media, targeting&#13;
        traders, food producers, the media sector and specialized institutions. This process would aim to&#13;
        increase data availability on the economic importance of poultry and livestock production inthe&#13;
        country and should also make more visible the governmental action plan for AI and should&#13;
        clarify the compensation and restocking mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 33 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22.     The Component would finance multi-media equipment, transportation and printingequipment,&#13;
computers and training. The Component would operate at the central (byNAEC) at inselected&#13;
provincial levels through local extension centers. Inputswould include three local consultants to be&#13;
stationed at NAEC: (a) an EducatiodTraining specialist (approximately 4 months); (b) an information&#13;
extension specialist, with animal health people (approximately 2 months); and (c) ajournalist/editor&#13;
(approximately 1month).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         D. RISKASSESSMENT&#13;
&#13;
23.     Success o f the ST Immediate Awareness and Public Information Campaign for Avian Influenza&#13;
will dependon the following:&#13;
&#13;
  0     Government commitment to the importance of the information, education and communication&#13;
        process in an emergency situation as an integrated routine activity in the daily activities of DAH;&#13;
&#13;
  0     An efficient national Task Group to formulate an awareness and public information strategy and&#13;
        produce technical guidelines and information for the poultry subsector;&#13;
&#13;
  0     Technical commitment by DAHto produce reliable information and to collaborate withNAEC,&#13;
        provincial Extension Centers, ICARD, NGOs, and other entities;&#13;
&#13;
  0     Availability o f funds, at the national and provincial level, to produce and disseminate&#13;
        communication and awareness materials; and&#13;
&#13;
  0     Availability o f qualified human resourcesand facilities inNAEC and the provincial extension&#13;
        centers to produce awareness and educational materials.&#13;
&#13;
24.     Success inthe medium and long-term will depend on the capacity of the DAHto integrate&#13;
Informationand CommunicationManagement as a routine activity into the mandate of Veterinary&#13;
Services, and to consider the management o f information and communication as an investment rather&#13;
than an expense.&#13;
&#13;
25.     Crucial points for the implementationo fthe Awareness and Public Information Component&#13;
include:&#13;
&#13;
  0     The technical capacity and the willingness o fNAEC at the national levelto take pro-active&#13;
        leadership o f this Component. The emergency nature o f this project requires quick operational&#13;
        commitment to implementawareness activities to prevent a possible returnof AI and to ensure a&#13;
        successful, disease-free restocking process;&#13;
&#13;
  0     NAEC will have to undertake the necessary technical dialogue with DAHand veterinary services&#13;
        at the provincial level. The key to success i s the creation o f ajoint Task Group (NAECDAH&#13;
        and other relevant governmental agencies); and&#13;
&#13;
  0     Linkages needto be activatedwith ICARD for specific informatioddata; specific targeted groups&#13;
        and/or channels an efficient transmission belt. The quality o f national consultants and their&#13;
        commitment to work with NAEC and DAHare keysto success.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                             A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE&#13;
&#13;
1.      Proiect Coordination and Manaoement. The National SteeringCommittee for controlling and&#13;
monitoring Avian Influenza, chairedby MARD's Vice Minister, will provide generalpolicies and&#13;
guidelines to the PCUfor project implementation, review annual work plans, and ensure coordination&#13;
and linkageswith relevant agencies. At central level, the National Project Coordination Unit (PCU) of&#13;
the on-goingIDA-fundedAgricultural DiversiJicationProject will be responsiblefor day-to-dayproject&#13;
implementation, supervision, and project monitoring. The ADP will receivetechnical assistance from&#13;
international and national consultants, technicalguidancefrom the Departmentof Animal Health (DAH),&#13;
Departmentof Agriculture (DA), National Agricultural ExtensionCenter (NAEC), and other concerned&#13;
departments and institutions of MARD. The use ofthe existing PCU will help avoid the needto develop&#13;
a separate structure for this small project for only two years and offer opportunitiesto scale up learning&#13;
and experiencesto the existing national programs.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Central Level. The PCU will be strengthenedby the recruitmentof additional staff who will be&#13;
responsiblefor overall administration, reportpreparation,and procurementand financial management of&#13;
the project. To facilitate project implementationat least one senior officer from eachDAH, DA, and&#13;
NAEC will be seconded to the PCU to be appointedas Project Coordinators incharge of the respective&#13;
project componentsundertheir oversight. Inaddition, the PCU, under the direction of the PSC, will be&#13;
responsiblefor coordinating with DAH, DAYNCAE andwith other institutions, to guide andmonitor&#13;
implementationat provincial and local levels. More specifically, DAHwill assist the PCU inpreparing&#13;
its annualand quarterly work plans, work budgets, andtechnical guidelines for ComponentA. Similarly,&#13;
DA andNAEC will respectivelyassist the PCU inimplementation of ComponentB and Component C.&#13;
The PCU is responsiblefor consolidating the overall plans for submissionto MARDandIDA, and&#13;
providing guidelines andmonitoring project implementationat all levels.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Provincial Level. Project implementationat the provincial level would be the direct&#13;
responsibility of each ofthe ten project provinces and collaborating line institutions, such as National&#13;
InstituteofVeterinary Research(NIVR) andNational InstituteofAnimal Health (NIAH). A simple&#13;
Provincial Project Implementation Unit (PPIU) will be formed ineach project province to implement&#13;
project activities inthe province under supervisionand guidance of the central PCU. The PPIUwill be&#13;
headedby a DARD Deputy Director and will draw, on part time-basis, qualified staff from relevant sub-&#13;
departments or centers of DARD, such as Animal Health, Agriculture, Extension, and Vietnam Women's&#13;
Union(VWU).&#13;
&#13;
4.      Technical activities will be implementedthrough the veterinary and extension service networks&#13;
at the provincial, district and commune levels. Contractedanimal health and extension workers would be&#13;
recruitedat the commune level to provide support services to beneficiary households. The VWU and&#13;
other NGOs will be involved inconducting surveillancepublic awareness campaigns, training, extension,&#13;
and activities at community level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                    A. PROCUREMENT METHODSAND RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
&#13;
1.       Procurementfor the proposedproject would be carriedout in accordance with World Bank&#13;
"Guidelines: ProcurementUnder IBRDLoans and IDA Credits", April 2004; and "Guidelines: Selection&#13;
andEmployment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers", April 2004 and the provisions stipulatedin&#13;
the Legal Agreement. The generaldescriptionofvarious itemsunder different expenditure category are&#13;
describedbelow and summarizedinTable A. For each contract to be financedby the Credit, the&#13;
different procurementmethodsor consultantselectionmethods, estimatedcosts, prior review&#13;
requirements, andtime frame are given inthe GeneralProcurementPlaninthe Attachment andadetailed&#13;
ProcurementPlanto be provided by MARD prior to effectiveness. The ProcurementPlan will be&#13;
updatedat least annually or as requiredto reflect the actual project implementationneeds.&#13;
&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
&#13;
2.       Civil Works estimatedat an aggregate amount of US$450,000, for contractsestimatedto range&#13;
from US25,OOO to US$lOO,OOO per contract, include construction for upgradingbio-security of 12&#13;
poultry farms inthe project provinces. All the works will be procuredthrough shoppingprocurement&#13;
method.&#13;
&#13;
Goods&#13;
&#13;
3.       Goods estimatedat an aggregate amount of US$3,600,000 to be procuredunder the proposed&#13;
project include equipment and reagents for national and regional veterinary centers, chickvaccination,&#13;
breedingstock supplies and vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Shoppingprocurement(national and international) would cover most ofthe equipment and&#13;
vaccination requiredfor the project. The amount for each contract, estimatedto rangefrom US$50,000&#13;
to US$250,000 would be relatively higher than the commonthresholdfor shopping($50,000) normally&#13;
usedfor conventionalprojects. Under the project goods estimatedto cost less than US$250,000 per&#13;
contract may be procuredthrough shopping. This higher threshold isjustified due to the emergency&#13;
nature of the project. ICB or NCB would be too time consumingand thus the use of these methodsmight&#13;
adversely affect the timely procurementof equipment andvaccine for urgentrecoveryand preventive&#13;
operations.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Procurement from specializedUNAgencies. Procurementfrom UNspecializedagencies&#13;
(notably WHO and IAPSO) may be used. Suchprocurement would cover laboratory equipment,&#13;
reagents, disinfectants, andvehicles.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Direct contractingof some essentialbreedingstock supplies is the appropriate method since&#13;
certified disease-free breedingstock such Sasso Grant, Kabir GP, Cherry Valley Duck, etc. are&#13;
obtainable only from a particular source. There will be about 5 contracts estimatedto rangefrom&#13;
US$lOO,OOO to US$300,000 per contract.&#13;
&#13;

biosecurity designs for the GP breedingfarms and for the training ofproject staff, commune staff and&#13;
farmers on animal disease surveillance and epidemiology, and animalhusbandryandbiosecurity. Most&#13;
consulting serviceswould be provided by individual consultants. Audit services may be procured&#13;
through the least-cost selectionmethod. Any other consulting contractwith firms estimated to cost less&#13;
than US$lOO,OOO per contract may be procuredthrough the methodof selectionbasedon consultant's&#13;
qualifications.&#13;
&#13;

US$570,000 will be carried in accordance with agreed proceduresbasedon training programs with&#13;
detaileditemizedbudgetsapprovedby the Bank. The training programs shall provide the objectives,&#13;
criteria for selectionof participants, venue and/or instituteselected, period of activity and estimatedcost.&#13;
Expenditures incurredunder these activities will generally be claimedunder SOEs.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
10.      An assessmentof the capacity ofthe ProjectManagementUnit (PMU) of the AIERP was&#13;
conductedby the Bank procurement specialist inMay 2004.&#13;
&#13;

staffedwith procurementstaff having adequate procurementexperience gainedover the last five years in&#13;
the implementationofthe IDA-funded Agricultural Diversification Project(ADP).&#13;
&#13;
12.     The issues andrisksconcerningthe procurementcomponent for implementationof the proposed&#13;
project have been identifiedand are mainlyrelatedto: (a) MARD's potentially slow internal approval&#13;
process; and (b) potentially heavy workload due to the emergencynature of the proposedproject in.&#13;
addition to the remaining workload o fthe Agricultural Diversification Project.&#13;
&#13;
13.     The recommendedcorrective measures are: (a) MARD to provide a simplified review procedure&#13;
for internal approval; and (b) PMUto recruit a procurementofficer to work full time for the durationof&#13;
the project.&#13;
&#13;

1,       An assessmentofthe project's financial managementarrangementswas conducted inMay 2004&#13;
and it is concluded that with the completion of the Action Plan as tabled inthis Annex, that the Project&#13;
meets the minimumrequirements o fthe Bank's OP/BP10.02. The project will adopt traditional&#13;
disbursement methods and will produce quarterly financial monitoringreports.&#13;
&#13;
CountryIssues&#13;
&#13;
2.       IDA conducted a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) ofVietnam in2001,&#13;
which provides a diagnosis o f the country's financial management environment. The CFAA helps the&#13;
Government and IDA, among other things, to assess and manage the riskthat public funds mightbe used&#13;
for unintendedpurposes and identify the key risks, capacity gaps and constraints to progress inthis area.&#13;
An Action Planto addressthe key findingso fthe CFAA has beenagreedupon with the Government.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Among the key findings of the CFAA that are relevant to the financial management aspects o f&#13;
this Project are the following: (a) managementreports for effective decision-making arenot widely used;&#13;
(b) as the requirements ofpublic expenditure accounting are very comprehensive and detailed, and&#13;
compliance with the financial managementrequirements is challenging for all units, particularly at the&#13;
lower levels; and (c) as accounting staff focus on more easily accomplished requirements like mechanical&#13;
verification o f payments and receipts, the regular and efficient monitoring o f state budget information for&#13;
effective use o f public funds at times is not carried out ina timely manner.&#13;
&#13;
4.       The CFAA also reports that "the current budget arrangement inVietnam suffers from a lack o f&#13;
transparency inthe achievement o f objectives." The conclusion of the assessment is that there is a&#13;
certain degree of fiduciary risk inthe use of public resources, although overall the fiduciary risk for this&#13;
Project is manageable for on-budget items, consideringthe steps that are envisioned to be taken under the&#13;
financial management plan.&#13;

&#13;
5.       At the central level, the current PCUo fthe on-going Agricultural Diversification Project under&#13;
the Agricultural Projects Management Board (APMB) o fMARD will be responsible for day-to-day&#13;
implementation, supervision, and project monitoring. The PCU will receive technical assistance from&#13;
national consultants, technical guidance from the Departments o f Animal Health(DAH) and Agriculture          '&#13;
(DA), the National Agricultural ExtensionCenter (NAEC), and other concerned Departments and&#13;
institutions o f MARD for each o f the project components, as follows:&#13;

               DAH, DA, andNAEC.&#13;
&#13;
6.       At provincial level, a simple Provincial Project Implementation Unit (PPIU) will be formed in&#13;
each province to implementactivities inthe province under supervisionand guidance of the PCU. The&#13;
PPIUwill be headedby a DARD Deputy Director andwill draw qualified staff from relevant sub-&#13;
departmentsand centers of DARD, such as Animal Health, Agriculture, Extension, andVietnam&#13;
Women's Union.&#13;
&#13;
Descriptionand Assessmentof FinancialManagementand DisbursementArrangementsAdequacy&#13;
&#13;
7.      A SpecialAccount (SA) will be opened at a commercialbank acceptableto IDA to receiveIDA&#13;
credit's advance and will be managedby the PCU. The initial SA advance will be made at the request of&#13;
the Ministry ofFinance, with subsequent SA replenishmentsagainstWithdrawal Applications,&#13;
accompaniedby either statements of expenditure or summary sheets and other appropriate documents.&#13;
Direct paymentto contractorswill be made against Withdrawal Applications for individual payments&#13;
exceeding20% of the SA threshold. All Withdrawal Applications will be approvedby the Ministry of&#13;
Finance before disbursementtakes place.&#13;
&#13;
8.      Most ofthe Project's expenditureswill be incurred at the PCU. Expenditures incurredby the&#13;
PPIUcomprise field allowances, vehicle operatingcosts andtraining costs and will be pre-financedby&#13;
the Governmentandsubsequentlyreimbursedfrom the SA after beingapprovedby Project's line Deputy&#13;
Director. The estimatedamount of governmentpre-financing funds requiredfor PPIUs expenditure are&#13;
estimatedat VND 2 billion.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Project activities that have been reviewed and authorizedby the Project's line director will be&#13;
usedas the basisfor approval of expenditure. Original bills andvouchers of expenditure incurred at&#13;
PPIUs will be retainedat the respectivePPIUand filed inan orderly manner for quick and easy access.&#13;
Reconciliationof incomeand expendituresbetweenPPIU and PCUwill be performedon a quarterly&#13;
basis, before preparationofthe Financial MonitoringReport (FMR).&#13;
&#13;
10.     A full-time accountantwill be employedby the PCU and a part-time accountant will be attached&#13;
to each PPIU. EachPPIUwill producea quarterly report ina standardizedformat andPCUswill use&#13;
accountingsoftware capable o f analyzingexpendituresand reimbursementsto the PPIU by each&#13;
province. PPUIs are requiredto submit their quarterly report within 15 days after the end ofthe period&#13;
under review to enable the reconciliation o f income and expendituresbefore preparationand submission&#13;
of the FMR. The accounting systemat boththe PCU andPPIUsmustbe able to analyze income by&#13;
source of funding, and expendituresby source of funding, project component, and category of&#13;
expenditure.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
   11.     Annual budgets will be preparedjointly by the PCUand PPIUs, basedon approvedannual&#13;
   procurementand activities plans. Paymentto contractors/supplierswill be made upon approvalof project&#13;
   director/project line Deputy Director or PPIU director, as appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
   12.     Supervisionon financial managementwill be performedat least twice ayear and an annual audit&#13;
   will be performed at the PCU andPPIUsby independentauditors recognizedby the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
   13.     A project financial management manual, acceptable to IDA, will be tailored and adoptedby the&#13;
   project. A number of actions needto be takento meet IDA's minimum requirements for financial&#13;
   management and to support project implementation, as detailed inthe Action Plan, tabledbelow.&#13;
&#13;
   RiskAnalysis and MitigatingMeasures&#13;
&#13;
   14.     Project activities will be implementedacross ten (10) project provinces that have little or no&#13;
   experience with IDA fundedproject. The issue of capacity and performanceconsistency at the&#13;
   provincial level will be addressedwith training, supervisionand guidancefrom the PCU, which is&#13;
   experiencedwith IDA-funded projects. Inaddition, the financial management systemat the provincial&#13;
   levels will be set up inclose consultationand with the assistance from the PCU.&#13;
&#13;
   Strengths and Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
   15.     The APMB has beenworking with a number of World Bankfunded projects and its PCU is&#13;
   currently managingthe IDA-funded Agricultural Diversification Project. No major internal control issue&#13;
   are recordedinthis project's most recent Auditors' Report. It is expectedthat the PCU's familiarity with&#13;
   IDA's financial management anddisbursement policies andprocedureswill speedup project&#13;
   implementationwithout negatively affecting financial management standards.&#13;
&#13;
   16.     It is likelythat severalPPIUs have limitedor no experiencewith World Bank-fundedprojects.&#13;
`  However, given that ProjectIDA-funded activities at the PPIUs are confined to training and field&#13;
   allowancesand operatingcosts, the PPUIs should be able to manage the financial management aspects of&#13;
   their activities. Inaddition, training will beprovided to project accountantsfrom time to time andthe&#13;
   quarterly reconciliation ofproject income and expenditures will help to improve their skills, knowledge&#13;
   and experience.&#13;
&#13;
   AccountingPoliciesand Procedures&#13;
&#13;
   17.     The Project will use accountingpolicies andproceduresacceptableto IDA. For reporting&#13;
   purposes, International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) should be usedby the Project. The&#13;
   Project will rely as muchas possibleonthe current accountingand reporting systems and internal&#13;
   controls of the PCU for its current World Bank-fundedprojects, and modify them as necessaryto comply&#13;
   with the DevelopmentCredit Agreement andthe Bank's policies, guidelinesandprocedureson Financial&#13;
   Management.&#13;
&#13;
   Reportingand Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
   18.     The project will prepare its annual accountsunder IPSAS and submit its auditedaccounts to the&#13;
   Bankno later than 6monthsfrom the closing date ofthe financial yeadperiod. Inaddition to the annual&#13;
   accounts, the project will prepare quarterly Financial MonitoringReports (FMR) ina format agreedby&#13;
   IDA and submit these to the Bank no later than 45 days from the closing date ofthe reportingquarter.&#13;
   The format o fthe FMR is tailored to the monitoring purposes of IDA andto the project management and&#13;
   will be madeavailable to the auditors as required.&#13;

                                 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.       Environmental impact. The project's environmentaland social impact would be positive, intwo&#13;
areas: (a) by improving laboratory procedures currently inuse and by improvingthe country's security&#13;
against a recurrence of the AI epidemic, which would have positive environmentalhealth benefits; and&#13;
(b) by improving the policy framework for the managementofpotential future outbreaks, with respectto&#13;
the compensation to poultry farmers affectedby cullingmeasuresandwithrespect to the humaneculling&#13;
of chickens and environmentalstandards for their disposal. No resettlement would be carried out under&#13;
the project.&#13;
&#13;
EnvironmentalIssues&#13;
&#13;
2.       Laboraton, testing and environmental health. Testingfor AI i s currently carried out by the&#13;
National Veterinary Diagnostic Center (under the Ministryof Agriculture and RuralDevelopment) and&#13;
by the National Instituteo fVeterinary Research. These laboratories now carry out tests to determine the&#13;
presence o f the AI H5 subgroup. The H5 diagnosis is based on a standard enzyme-linkedimmuno-&#13;
absorbent assay (ELISA), a relatively simple procedure for which there is good capacity inthese&#13;
laboratories. Tests to determine the presence of the highly pathogenic form o f the virus (H5N1),the&#13;
specific AI subgroup that was responsible for the recent outbreak inVietnam, are currently carried out by&#13;
laboratories in Singapore and other locations outside o f Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
3.        The project would finance: (a) general improvements to the NVDC laboratory and four of its six&#13;
Regional Veterinary Centers (RVCs), and to the NNR labs inHanoi and Ho Chi MinhCity; (b) creation&#13;
of a Virus Reference Laboratory (VRC) at the NNR laboratory inHanoi and testingand storing samples&#13;
o f the strains of H5N1 for applied research and monitoring purposes. The project will not support any&#13;
investments related to pathogenicitytesting in live animal models; and (c) upgradingthe technical&#13;
capacity and safety equipment inthe labs.&#13;
&#13;
4.        The project would have apositive impact on laboratory worker safety, reducingopportunities for&#13;
transmission of AI to humans by providing more safe facilities and buildingcapacity for their use. The&#13;
project will improve and ensure safety by meeting international standards established by the OIE (World&#13;
Organizationfor Animal Health). The adoption of and adherenceto OIE standards will be assistedand&#13;
supervisedthrough technical assistance from FAO. The investments to establish a VRL is subject to two&#13;
conditionalities: (a) the preparationof an accident mitigation plan, and (b) the construction of the VRL&#13;
under acceptable biosafety standards, bothunderterms acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Environmental Management on Poultry Farms. The project would assistthe Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture and Rural Development to develop a strategy for managingfuture AI outbreaks. The strategy&#13;
would cover the necessary elements for detection o f pathogens and measuresto prevent the spread of the&#13;
disease and control and eradicate outbreaks. The project would have potentially positive environmental&#13;
impacts by adopting OIE standards intwo areas:&#13;
     (a) Enhancing biosecurity and health status of all GP poultry breedingfarms. The Awareness and&#13;
         Public Information Component C would train farm staff in basic hygiene principles and the&#13;
&#13;

                                                   - 5 9 -&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        proper use of disinfectants, increasinghumansafety by lesseningthe risk of exposure to avian&#13;
        influenza; and&#13;
    (b) Ensuringthat environmentalsafeguards are mainstreamedinto protocols andprocedures&#13;
        designedto control outbreaks. The issues ofenvironmental importancehere include (i)        storage&#13;
        anduse o f surfactantsusedto disinfect farms after an outbreak, and (ii)  handling and disposalof&#13;
        poultry that are identified for culling to control outbreaks, with regardto humaneeuthanizingof&#13;
        animals and disposal of carcasses that avoids contaminationof ground water.&#13;
&#13;
Social Issues&#13;
&#13;
6.      Socio-economic. On a national scale the A I epidemic has cost Vietnam 0.3% of GDP, equivalent&#13;
to severalhundredmillion U S dollars, and financially affected some 9 million households. The poultry&#13;
sub-sector comprises 17% of agricultural GDP. The project would provide country-wide field&#13;
surveillance that would play an important role inpreventingthe recurrence of AI, thereby safeguarding&#13;
the poultry farmers' investmentandfostering producer and consumer confidence. Although arecurrence&#13;
of A I can never be ruled out with absolute certainty, the chances of identifying new flare-ups at a very&#13;
early stage will be greatly improvedprovided the project activities are carriedout vigorously. Project&#13;
benefits to stakeholders, from restockingand increased protection against AI, are substantial, especially&#13;
for those without the financial means to restock.&#13;
&#13;
7.      The socio-economic impact of project interventionswill be very positive. With the emphasis on&#13;
smallholder poultry owners, many ofthem women who have suffered significant financial lossesfrom&#13;
destocking,, and an early warning and other preventionmeasures to assistthe poultry sector inguarding&#13;
against the recurrence of AI. Great care will be takento ensure that the restocking exercise does not&#13;
trigger new outbreaks. This will be done by stringent monitoring and testing ofreplacementstock&#13;
suppliersunder the SurveillanceComponent, and registeringthese enterprises as being disease-free.&#13;
&#13;
8.      Social Issues inthe Emergency Stratem.The project's assistance to MARD indevelopinga&#13;
strategyto manage future AI outbreaks would have a positive social impact by ensuringdevelopment of&#13;
GoV's policy on compensationfor poultry farmers affectedby future outbreaks.&#13;

            Vietnam - Avian Influenza Emergency
            Recovery Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The project's overall goal is to
            address the short and medium-term actions to be undertaken
            by the Government to strengthen its veterinary surveillance
            and diagnostic infrastructure in order to avoid, or at least
            minimize, a recurrence of Avian Influenza (AI) that would
            further damage the poultry sub-sector. The development
            objectives of the proposed project are threefold in support
            of the National Action Plan for the control of Avian
            Influenza Epidemic: (a) to strengthen disease surveillance
            and diagnostic capacity in the control of Highly Pathogenic
            Avian Influenza (HPAI); (b) to strengthen the poultry sector
            infrastructure to better cope with serious disease
            outbreaks; and (c) to safeguard human health by improving
            public awareness and information. The above objectives
            should be viewed as the first phase of a longer-term program
            aimed at restructuring Vietnam's poultry sub-sector and
            strengthening the veterinary services system to deal with
            other potentially destructive infectious disease outbreaks.
            The proposed project would therefore serve as a pioneering
            effort to evaluate the methodologies most suitable for
            emergency preparedness and longer-term intervention.
