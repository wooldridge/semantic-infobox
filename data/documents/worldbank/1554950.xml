SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES IN ZIMBABWE&#13;
The black majority government of Zimbabwe, coming to power after a long&#13;
struggle for independence, has announced its strong commitment to social&#13;
services to benefit the vast majority of the population. In education, two&#13;
ethnically separate systems will have to be effectively amalgamated, and more&#13;
basic educational programs for the tribal lands population will have to be&#13;
designed. This calls for a dramatic increase in the number of qualified&#13;
teachers, possible only through a crash training program. In health, there&#13;
has to be significant extension of services in tribal areas within the frame-&#13;
work of a primary health care system. In housing, low-cost shelter programs&#13;
in the urban areas should be closely linked with rural development strategies&#13;
to create new urban centers in tribal areas.&#13;
In moving in these directions, several sectoral issues have to be&#13;
addressed: What levels of public expenditure are adequate in these sectors?&#13;
how can more resources be mobilized? how can the organizational and personnel&#13;
constraints be handled? And how can the competing goals of high standards&#13;
and extensive coverage of services be resolved? This paper looks at these&#13;
issues and outlines the prospects. Specific plans and resource requirements&#13;
are also reviewed.&#13;

Introductory Note&#13;
The first World Bank economic mission visited Zimbabwe from August 24 to&#13;
September 11, 1980. Rashid Faruaee; a member of the mission, reviewed the&#13;
social sectors and basic needs services in Zimbabwe except education. Andre&#13;
Salmon reviewed the education sector. A shorter version of this report has&#13;
been included in the country economic report for Zimbabwe. The sectoral&#13;
details included in this separate report are intended for use by other opera-&#13;
tional denartments in the Bank, especially Urban Projects, East Africa Educa-&#13;
tion; and Population, Health, and Nutrition.&#13;

1. The Main Issues and Requirements&#13;
In April 1980 Zimbabwe drew the world's attention as it gained independence&#13;
from Britain and transferred political power to the black majority through&#13;
general elections. The new majority government inherited a socioeconomic&#13;
system marked by dualism and disparity. A small part of the economy, cov-&#13;
ering non-Africans, is a developed capitalistic system. But most of the&#13;
inhabitants, rural Africans, live a tribal existence on subsistence agri-&#13;
culture. Another comparatively small segment of the society, urban Africans&#13;
and African workers on non-African farms, links the first two. The rural-&#13;
urban disparity in living standiards is significant; but the most glaring&#13;
disparity is between urban Europeans and the rural population on tribal lands.&#13;
The new government's most important goal is to develop tribal areas to improve&#13;
the standard of living of the population there.&#13;
THE ECONOMY&#13;
Zimbabwe is rich in mineral resources, including gold, silver, asbestos,&#13;
nickel, copper, chrome, cobalt, and coal. Compared with its potential, the&#13;
mining industry is still small, accounting for only about 8 percent of the&#13;
gross domestic product (GDP) in 1979. Manufacturing is the most important&#13;
economic activity (25 percent of GDP in 1979). The two most important manu-&#13;
facturing branches are food stuffs and metals and metal products. But the&#13;
agricultural sector still dominates employment, taking the majority of the&#13;
Andre Salmon provided a background report on education for this paper. Robert&#13;
Myers, Arthur Hazlewood, iluw Jones, John Evans, Peter Hall, K.C. Zachariah,&#13;
Francois Orivel and Daniel Kaufmann gave valuable comments on an earlier&#13;
draft. Jeffrey Racki helped with some background material on housing and Mao&#13;
Sin helped in research.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
working-age population, though its share in GDP was only 12 percent in 1979. 1/&#13;
Major crops include maize, the staple food; subsistence crops; tobacco, the&#13;
most important cash crop; cotton; soybeans; coffee; and sugarcane.&#13;
Only 35 percent of the population is in the formal sector, which&#13;
produces more than 90 percent of GDP. Sixty-five percent of the population is&#13;
in the traditional subsistence sector, which produces only 10 percent of GDP.&#13;
Migrant labor constitutes the bridge between the sectors: 50 to 60 percent of&#13;
the peasant households wholly or partly depend on income derived from the&#13;
modern formal sector.&#13;
During 1965-75 the economy grew 7.5 percent a year. In 1976&#13;
the economy declined 1.4 percent, and in 1977 the negative growth rate&#13;
hit -7.4 percent. There was a slight improvement -- to -3.1 percent -- in&#13;
1978. In 1979 the negative economic trend was halted by recovery in the&#13;
mining and manufacturing sectors. In current prices the GDP of Zimbabwe is&#13;
estimated to have been Z$2,627 million in 1979, or about Z$360 (US$580) per&#13;
capita.&#13;
DEMOGRAPHY&#13;
The latest census in Zimbabwe was taken in 1969. Extrapolating the 1969&#13;
census, the Central Statistical Office estimates the population of Zimbabwe&#13;
at 7,487,000 in 1980. The same source shows that Africans constitute 95.5&#13;
percent of the population, Europeans 4 percent, and the rest 0.5 percent.&#13;
The Africans belong to one of two major tribal groups. Shona-speaking tribes&#13;
account for 77 percent of the population; Ndebele, 18 percent.&#13;
1.   Zimbabwe had a drought in 1979; in normal years, the share is about&#13;
18 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
More than four-fifths of the non-African population (Europeans,&#13;
Asians, and Coloreds), who constitute less than 5 percent of the total popu-&#13;
lation, live in urban areas; the remaining non-African population is engaged&#13;
in commercial farming, owning 50 percent of the agricultural land--the most&#13;
agriculturally productive land of the country. Eighty percent of the Africans&#13;
live in rural areas: most of them in the Tribal Trust Lands (tribal lands),&#13;
some in the African Purchase Lands (where Africans can own land); and some on&#13;
the large non-African farms. Urban growth from rural-urban migration has&#13;
been constrained by official policies regulating African migrants to cities.&#13;
Because of past policies, the urban African population is disproportionately&#13;
made up of working-age males. The rural population is left with an excess&#13;
of old people, women, and children.&#13;
As expected, the age curves of the African and European populations&#13;
differ significantly. The age curve of the European population is cylindrical&#13;
because of the high level of adult emigration. The pyramidal shape of the&#13;
African population is characteristic of underdeveloped countries: more than&#13;
half are under fifteen.&#13;
The Zimbabwean population is growing 3.5 percent a year. The crude&#13;
birth rate is about 47 (estimated for 1978), high even by African standards.&#13;
The death rate (estimated for the same year) is 13 -- low by African stan-&#13;
dards. Mortality conditions vary significantly between the African and non-&#13;
African populations. Available data indicate that the infant mortality rate&#13;
among Europeans was about 16 per 1,000 live births in 1978, compared with 120&#13;
to 220 for rural Africans in the same year. The urban African population had&#13;
an infant mortality rate of 30 per 1,000 live births in 1978, reflecting the&#13;
better environment, easier access to facilities and services, and generally&#13;
higher living standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-.4 -&#13;
The present government of Zimbabwe has expressed a strong commit-&#13;
ment to develop such social services as education, health, housing, water,&#13;
and sanitation. Two factors especially motivated this commitment. First,&#13;
schools, clinics, hospitals, and other infrastructure for services were&#13;
seriously damaged during the internal strife. Quick rehabilitation of these&#13;
facilities is the most immediate concern. The second factor is somewhat&#13;
deeper. The present leadership believes that developing services, especially&#13;
those relevant to human development, will significantly improve the level of&#13;
living of the rural population in tribal areas.&#13;
SOCIAL SERVICES: ISSUES AND REQUIREMENTS&#13;
The status of services and the goal of the government to improve the living&#13;
conditions of the population in tribal areas indicate the future directions&#13;
of these sectors. First, to meet the needs of the majority, the orientation&#13;
and functioning of the delivery systems will have to change to provide sub-&#13;
stantially more services to the rural poor. Second, because of intersectoral&#13;
linkages, many services will have to be developed in a multisectoral frame-&#13;
work. For example, health programs will have to be coordinated with programs&#13;
of sanitation and water supply, more adequate nutrition, and decent housing&#13;
for those without it. Third, because of the need for a multisectoral approach,&#13;
the development of social services will require more local government partici-&#13;
pation in the design and provision of services.&#13;
In addition to these general directions, several sector-specific&#13;
points can be noted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In education, the system is going through a transition: the two&#13;
ethnically separate systems were amalgamated into one in 1979, and the exam-&#13;
ination system has fundamentally changed since independence in April 1980.&#13;
Social pressure from Africans for access to education is strong. Primary&#13;
enrollment increased more than 50 percent in 1980. The government is reassess-&#13;
ing how to implement its basic objectives: universal basic education followed&#13;
by formal or nonformal junior secondary education or further education and&#13;
vocational training. No precise assessments of manpower needs, no comprehen-&#13;
sive surveys of training resources, and no manpower development plans have&#13;
been produced. But the outcomes of ongoing planning are expected to be known&#13;
in the second half of 1981, and it is expected that the plan will aim at sub-&#13;
stantially increasing access to education and training for those who have&#13;
had limited access. In addition, the education and manpower plans will have&#13;
to address the already evident mismatch of supply and demand in some skill&#13;
categories, a mismatch that will be aggravated by the likely exodus of the&#13;
white skilled workers.&#13;
In health, more emphasis is needed on primary health care. This&#13;
means a massive extension of basic health facilities in rural areas. At the&#13;
lowest level, the capability to deal with the most common health problems will&#13;
have to be developed. Primary health care centers will constitute the lowest&#13;
level of a properly designed. health-care pyramid. In addition, much more&#13;
emphasis will be needed on preventive measures, because these measures are --&#13;
with primary health care -- the most cost-effective forms of health provision.&#13;
According to official sources, 90 percent of the diseases in Zimbabwe are pre-&#13;
ventable. But in 1978-79 preventive services accounted for only 9 percent of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
the health budget, compared with 87 percent for treatment. In the future,&#13;
village health workers, in addition to diagnosing and treating common diseases,&#13;
will have to educate the community in hygiene, nutrition, and personal health&#13;
care. If health workers are from the community, they can enjoy the confidence&#13;
and acceptance of the people they serve. The central, general, and district&#13;
hospitals will serve more as referral hospitals.&#13;
In water and sanitation, the emphasis will have to be on community&#13;
participation. Use of safe water and better sanitation often require extra&#13;
efforts and changes of habits, which can come only through community educa-&#13;
tion and awareness. The development of low-cost technology for these ser-&#13;
vices in rural areas is essential: the system of piped-water supply and&#13;
water-borne sanitation developed in urban areas cannot be replicated in&#13;
low-density rural areas. But a promising start has been made--Blair Research&#13;
Institute in Salisbury has been experimenting with low-cost designs of deep&#13;
tubewells and pit latrines.&#13;
In housing, the general strategy must first address the problems of&#13;
low-income Africans living in tribal areas. Housing development cannot be&#13;
solely confined to urban areas. It will also have to consider a program for&#13;
coordinating rural development and the decentralization of urban growth. That&#13;
would introduce urban services, infrastructure, and jobs into these lagging&#13;
regions and provide alternatives to would-be migrants to the cities. The&#13;
benefits of new urban centers in tribal areas must, however, be weighed&#13;
against the costs of setting them up.&#13;
Principal Issues&#13;
The directions just outlined call for a transformation in the&#13;
economy -- and in the role of the public sector. Although Zimbabwe is better&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
off than most developing countries, this transformation raises several issues.&#13;
Progress will depend on how these issues are addressed.&#13;
Level of expenditure. How does the current expenditure on social&#13;
services in Zimbabwe compare with that of other countries with the same per&#13;
capita income? Should the goal to reduce disparities in coverage affect the&#13;
expenditure on social infrastructure and services?&#13;
Zimbabwe spends about 2 percent of its GNP on health, about the&#13;
average for all developing countries. The per capita public expenditure on&#13;
health is $8.00, which is low when compared with that in countries with similar&#13;
income. Zambia, for example, has a comparable per capita income but spends&#13;
$14.00 per capita in the public sector. In the relation of health expenditure&#13;
to per capita income, Zimbabwe is below the intercountry norm.&#13;
Extending subsidized health services to the low-income African&#13;
population in rural areas is one way of reducing disparities in coverage.    But&#13;
this implies a substantial increase in health expenditures, over and above&#13;
that already experienced.&#13;
Spending has been more than adequate to ensure supplies of water in&#13;
urban areas. But compared with other African countries, the expenditure on&#13;
rural water supply has been low. Investment has been adequate to develop good&#13;
sanitation in the urban areas, but sanitation in rural areas is almost non-&#13;
existent, a situation comparable to that in other African countries. To meet&#13;
the need for water supply in tribal areas will require a substantial expendi-&#13;
ture. Improving sanitation in rural areas will have to come mainly through a&#13;
primary care health system and community participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
In education, expenditure already is high, but the benefit is not&#13;
equitably distributed. Recurrent expenditure on education accounted for 13.3&#13;
percent of central government recurrent expenditure in 1979 (16 percent in&#13;
1980) and 4.6 percent of GNP. The last figure rises to 5.4 percent if private&#13;
contributions to education are included. This share in GNP is high for a&#13;
country with such a low enrollment ratio at the secondary level and indicates&#13;
higher-than-average recurrent unit costs. The unit cost for primary educa-&#13;
tion (Z$85) is in line with that of countries with similar income, but the&#13;
unit costs for secondary education (Z$560), teacher training (Z$1,850), and&#13;
university (Z$4,900) are similar to or higher than those of OECD countries.&#13;
Central government capital investment in education has averaged 8.5 percent of&#13;
government capital outlay over the last five years.&#13;
Extending facilities to reduce disparity in educational services&#13;
will increase the total education budget -- by a factor of 2.6 by 1985. 1/ In&#13;
1980 the government recurrent expenditure on education rose 30 percent in real&#13;
terms. The government capital outlay for education was also expected to&#13;
rise to 10.5 percent of government investment in the FY81 budget (from 8.5&#13;
percent) in response to increasing enrollment.&#13;
For housing, the sector never attained more than 16 percent of the&#13;
gross fixed capital formation. The figure for most economies of comparable&#13;
per capita income is 20 to 30 percent. Public expenditure on low-cost housing&#13;
in Zimbabwe nevertheless compares favorably with that of those other countries.&#13;
1/   This increase is inevitable unless a policy is pursued to recover full&#13;
cost from those who are willing and able to pay for services (see the&#13;
discussion in the next section).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
More expenditure on low-income housing will not reduce the disparity between&#13;
urban and tribal areas, but if pursued as part of overall and balanced devel-&#13;
opment, it can reduce the disparity between income groups in urban areas.&#13;
Budgetary burden and financing services. The budgetary burden of&#13;
the services has increased: for example, there has,been a 55 percent increase&#13;
in health expenditure between FY79 and FY80. The increase is caused by the&#13;
change in policy in September 1980 to make all health services free-for those&#13;
earning Z $150.00 a month or less -- and to take over the running of mission&#13;
health facilities. The pricing of services is such that there is a substan-&#13;
tial subsidy to rich patients arid private physicians (who can use government&#13;
hospital facilities at highly subsidized rates).&#13;
The government subsidizes nearly 90 percent of the health care. At&#13;
Andrew Fleming Hospital, the subsidy per patient unit in 1979 was Z$31.3.&#13;
Similar subsidies exist in other hospitals, although at a much lower amount&#13;
per patient unit. An examination of the revenue sources indicates that the&#13;
government derives a sizable part (nearly 26 percent in 1979) from rents and&#13;
the taxes on supernormal profits. This revenue is collected from corporate&#13;
income tax and royalties, which generally accrue from extracting exhaustible&#13;
resources. Although the subsidy in health care is theoretically for all, more&#13;
goes to the users of the services of Andrew Fleming Hospital, users who belong&#13;
to the higher income group. That means the rich are subsidized. A system of&#13;
full cost-recovery -- or even charging more than the cost from those who are&#13;
able and willing to pay -- must be developed to achieve equity and quality.&#13;
For water, there has been a subsidy insofar as the depreciation&#13;
of the water supply system has not been charged for. Full cost-pricing of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
urban water supply appears reasonable. For rural water supply, community&#13;
participation in design and implementation is desirable.&#13;
In education, the rise in expenditure has also been dramatic. During&#13;
1974-79, central government recurrent expenditure on education grew less than&#13;
5 percent a year in real terms--or half the 10 percent rate for all central&#13;
government recurrent expenditure. In 1980 recurrent educational expenditure&#13;
increased twice as fast as total recurrent expenditures--more than 30 percent&#13;
in real terms, assuming a 10 percent rate of inflation--and reached almost&#13;
Z$170 million. This dramatic rise is caused mainly by the increase in sal-&#13;
aries and grants to private education--respectively 84 percent and 8 percent&#13;
of the budget of the Ministry of Education and Culture. The salaries of all&#13;
teachers were unified at an average of Z$7,000 a year. That put the average&#13;
salary of teachers far above that elsewhere in relation to per capita GNP --&#13;
almost twenty times the per capita GNP in Zimbabwe, compared with the world&#13;
average at about twice the per capita GNP. Primary education became free and&#13;
primary enrollment exploded. Revenues (principally from fees) fell from 7&#13;
percent to 5 percent of recurrent expenditure. The issue in education is the&#13;
same as in health. If the expensive education that benefits only a small part&#13;
of the population is to be maintained for that by the rest of the population,&#13;
a full cost-recovery system has to be introduced. This would be in line with&#13;
systems elsewhere, where high-cost private schools with fees exist side-by-&#13;
side with free public schools for basic education.&#13;
In housing, the African middle-income group often benefits from the&#13;
houses built by the government, the local authorities, or the parastatal&#13;
body. The poorest Africans remain renters and essentially pay proportionately&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
more of their income for housing.    This could be corrected if demand pricing&#13;
of the standard housing units were introduced, because this would take away&#13;
profits from renting these units.    The demand pricing of the standard units&#13;
would generate profits which could then be used to subsidize low-cost housing&#13;
units, thus making it possible for even the poorest groups to afford these&#13;
units.&#13;
Organization and personnel. Even if there are more resources to&#13;
extend health services to tribal areas, there will be an organizational prob-&#13;
lem. The civil service employees and the health professionals have little&#13;
experience in the rural areas, and they are hesitant to proceed in an un-&#13;
familiar world. For example, about 90 percent of the expenditures have been&#13;
on curative facilities, with a clear urban bias. A change to a primary health&#13;
care system, using a large number of village health workers and emphasizing&#13;
prevention, calls for a change in orientation by the civil service and by&#13;
professionals. The current plan is to increase the number of village health&#13;
workers from a meager 199 to 300. At least 2,000 front-line workers are&#13;
needed to make the ratio of primary health workers to population reasonable. 1/&#13;
1.   In the primary health care system, these village workers have varied&#13;
responsibilities--diagnosing and treating common cases, referring other&#13;
cases, and educating the community about nutrition, hygiene, and personal&#13;
health care. One such primary worker serves 1,000 to 5,000 people in&#13;
countries or projects where primary health care is provided. For exam-&#13;
ple, in some states in India where primary health care has been intro-&#13;
duced, there is one worker per 1,000. Even if there were to be one&#13;
worker for 3,000 people, the number of workers required in Zimbabwe&#13;
would be 2,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Even if the orientation of the civil service and of professionals&#13;
changes, and more investments are planned for providing human development&#13;
services in rural areas, a serious issue remains. How is the government&#13;
structure to be extended to rural areas and how are the requisite personnel to&#13;
be obtained? The situation is aggravated by the exodus of some (and poten-&#13;
tially more) white professionals, who are badly needed to train and supervise&#13;
the cadre of rural workers. For example, the substantial extension of the&#13;
village health worker cadre will require doctors, medical assistants, and&#13;
community health nurses as trainers and supervisors in the field. The super-&#13;
vising cadres of the rural workers will also have to be substantially enlarged,&#13;
which in turn will mean specialists and professionals.&#13;
Increasing the welfare and income of the population in tribal areas&#13;
will be a multisectoral task. The present system of coordination is not very&#13;
effective. The Planning Ministry must be expanded to assume responsibility&#13;
for overall planning and coordination. For example, the most serious health&#13;
hazard in rural Zimbabwe is caused by the limited access to safe water. But&#13;
the coordination needed to establish a health and water-supply program is&#13;
minimal.&#13;
In education, coordination is inadequate between the private and&#13;
public agencies involved in education and training. So far, there is no&#13;
comprehensive operational plan to reorganize the system to provide equal&#13;
access to education and to reform the curricula. The Ministry of Education&#13;
and Culture is not adequately structured and staffed; it appears to be having&#13;
difficulty in adjusting to the management of massive enrollments. The main&#13;
challenge is how to cater to a poor segment of a population that is growing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
3.6 percent a year. This cannot be achieved by the formal system, and nonfor-&#13;
mal education still is insufficiently developed. The enrollment of 400,000&#13;
new primary students in 1980 has resulted in overcrowded schools and a dramatic&#13;
rise of the proportion of untrained and inadequately qualified teachers, who&#13;
now make up about 70 percent of the teaching staff.&#13;
Standards or coverage. The Asian and European populations have&#13;
access to high-quality services; the tribal population-has almost no access&#13;
to modern services. Other Africans--living in the urban centers, working&#13;
on the European farms, or farmiq3 in the African Purchase Lands--have varying&#13;
access to services. For the future, basic services will have to be extended&#13;
to areas where access is limited. That is obvious. The issue is whether&#13;
this extension will sacrifice quality.&#13;
In health, the fear that the rapid expansion of health care to&#13;
tribal areas will result in a loss of quality is partly unfounded. Some&#13;
services, such as public health measures, generally do not vary in quality.&#13;
That fear also is partly irrelevant, because the high quality of service&#13;
cannot meet the health needs of 95 percent of the population. A primary&#13;
health care system does not imply lower quality service.&#13;
The primary health care system is essentially a pyramid, and this&#13;
system can be built in Zimbabwe without sacrificing quality. But it is rea-&#13;
sonable to ask about what pace is realistic--the pace at which the health&#13;
care system can be modified, adjusted, and made into a pyramidal primary&#13;
health care system responsive to the health needs of the majority. With&#13;
more emphasis on expanding and strengthening the base of the pyramid, more&#13;
resources will go into primary care and preventive programs. This may leave&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
fewer resources for the curative structure to sustain itself at the same level&#13;
as before; this implies, as discussed previously, that alternative ways of&#13;
cost recovery should be explored.&#13;
For urban housing, the issue of standards against coverage is espe-&#13;
cially relevant. Four kinds of low-income houses are now built. For example,&#13;
the lowest grade--site and services--is meant to provide transitional shelter&#13;
with a provision for gradual upgrading; the next grade is called ultralow-cost&#13;
housing. The unit costs of the four types in order of quality are Z$1,032,&#13;
Z$1,597, Z$2,115, and Z$3,617. There obviously is a trade-off between the&#13;
number of units and the types to be built. It is important, however, to&#13;
realize that the lowest grade (site and services) is suitable only if built&#13;
in the city (near workplaces) where the allottees can live and gradually&#13;
construct the shelter. If these sites and services are at considerable dis-&#13;
tance from workplaces, as the low-cost townships in Zimbabwe are, they may&#13;
not be helpful. The pertinent consideration is the practice of demand-pricing&#13;
the better grade houses and subsidizing the lower grade with profits that are&#13;
likely to result from the sale of the better grade units.&#13;
In education, the main issue is the bottleneck at the secondary level&#13;
because of insufficient facilities and fees that African families generally&#13;
cannot afford. Only 23 percent of African primary graduates are admitted to&#13;
secondary schools. Moreover, the policy of high academic standards, univer-&#13;
sally applied, results in high rates of failures and dropouts by African&#13;
students. Of 1,000 seven-year olds, 800 enter grade 1, 500 complete their&#13;
primary education, 120 enter junior secondary education, 70 complete it, and&#13;
five complete their senior secondary education. Such access to secondary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
education is not peculiar to Zimbabwe; the situation is similar in Tanzania,&#13;
but because of a deliberate manpower policy. In Zimbabwe, the restriction is&#13;
largely discriminatory. For the future, the benefits and costs of widening&#13;
the access to secondary education need to be carefully assessed. Apparently,&#13;
manpower needs in Zimbabwe after independence underline the importance of&#13;
widening the access of the African population to secondary education, but it&#13;
may not be necessary to make universal the access to secondary schools.&#13;
Plans and Resources Required&#13;
Pending a new education plan, a short-term plan for FY80-81 includes&#13;
expanding or building about fifty primary schools, secondary schools, and&#13;
teacher training colleges; establishing an emergency training scheme--possibly&#13;
with help from UNICEF--for 8,000 untrained and 12,000 inadequately qualified&#13;
primary teachers; and introducing double-shifting to primary education.&#13;
On the basis of presenf: trends and government priorities, it is&#13;
estimated that primary enrollment: may grow 90,000 a year in the early 1980s.&#13;
A fourfold increase of present secondary enrollments is likely over the&#13;
decade. About 4,000 new teachers would be needed each year--almost three&#13;
times as many as the present highest possible output of the system--requir-&#13;
ing a more than doubling of the places available in 1981 in tribal areas and&#13;
quadrupling the programs of the lJniversity's Faculty of Education.   In addi-&#13;
tion, the government intends to eradicate illiteracy in the 1980s, for which&#13;
an estimated 4,000 instructors would be required to provide an estimated two&#13;
million illiterates with functional literacy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
By the end of the decade, about 6,600 extension specialists will be&#13;
needed to improve extension services for an estimated 1,200,000 farmers on&#13;
tribal lands and 13,000 on African Purchase Land and for the operations of&#13;
the modern agricultural sector. The government plans to double the capacity&#13;
of the agricultural institutes (to 720 places, for an annual output of 240&#13;
extension agents), and to expand the agricultural colleges (to 240 student&#13;
places, for an annual output of about 80 extension officers). Although agri-&#13;
cultural colleges are expected to cope with the estimated needs, the proposed&#13;
expansion of the agricultural institutes will be insufficient. Their output&#13;
will fall short by an estimated 260 extension agents a year; 800 additional&#13;
student places will be needed, preferably in two institutes.&#13;
The government has increased the vocational training budget for&#13;
FY80-81 by 48 percent in nominal terms and intends to establish a network&#13;
of vocational training centers for semiskilled training. The government&#13;
also plans to establish a technical college for commerce as a branch of the&#13;
Bulawayo Polytechnic; expand a third polytechnic for 200 engineering appren-&#13;
tices this year; provide training in management, business administration, and&#13;
secretarial skills; and establish institutes for administration.&#13;
The recent budget increase in health has not led to an expansion&#13;
of services.  Once the needed health care program is substantially extended,&#13;
the cost will rise dramatically. For example, there will be a need for a&#13;
tenfold increase in primary health workers. This goal will require enor-&#13;
mous resources--human and financial. As noted before, this may require a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
policy of full (social) cost-pricing for the high-quality urban health ser-&#13;
vices available to high-income households.&#13;
The five-year investment plan, essentially based on a plan prepared&#13;
by the earlier government, indicates a stipulated development expenditure of&#13;
Z$23.5 million (in 1980 prices), of which Z$14.3 million are earmarked for the&#13;
extension of the rural health program. This includes building 200 new rural&#13;
clinics, improving and constructing rural hospitals, and strengthening preven-&#13;
tive services. This tentative plan is likely to be revised to give even more&#13;
emphasis to meeting the health needs of the rural population. A preliminary&#13;
report from the Minister of Health suggests revisions and additions that will&#13;
probably require a rise in expenditure from Z$14.3 million to Z$40.1 million&#13;
(in 1980 prices)--an increase of nearly 300 percent.&#13;
The Ministry of Water Development estimates that the aims of the&#13;
UN Water Decade could be met by 1990 by providing everyone with potable water&#13;
in the rural areas at a cost of Z$500 million in 1980 prices. This estimate&#13;
is based on the ministry's approximate cost experience of 300-500 people&#13;
consuming 5,000-10,000 gals/day. To cover the rural population of 4 million&#13;
at Z$5,000/400 persons, the total approximate cost will be Z$500 million.&#13;
For housing, the stipulated expenditure to construct 167,000&#13;
housing units in the next five years is Z$773 million. This will involve&#13;
a substantial increase from the past construction program of the housing&#13;
department. Three types of houses are to be built--ultralow-cost houses of&#13;
one to two rooms, low-cost houses of one to two rooms, and standard houses of&#13;
two to three rooms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
The cost of the housing program in the next five years has been&#13;
based on several assumptions: that 60 percent of those needing houses can&#13;
afford ultralow-cost houses, that 25 percent will buy the next grade housing&#13;
unit, that 15 percent will buy the higher grade low-cost housing units, and&#13;
these last will be priced 20 percent higher than cost. The monthly payment&#13;
for the different categories of houses will vary from Z$19.65 to Z$45.06,&#13;
and the cost of the program in current prices will be Z$808.6 million. The&#13;
reconstruction budget stipulated for the housing sector is Z$11.2 million&#13;
(in 1980 prices).&#13;
The resource needs of these sectors for reconstruction and devel-&#13;
opment are thus substantial. In addition, the sectors need a systematic&#13;
evaluation of the issues just outlined and policies to address these issues&#13;
effectively. In one sense, the physical development of these sectors is only&#13;
as important as the development of 'right policies for a smooth transformation&#13;
to the new government's programs.&#13;
CONCLUSION&#13;
Social services in Zimbabwe compare favorably with those in other African&#13;
countries. But the disparity in coverage is more pronounced in Zimbabwe&#13;
than in most African countries because of past policies. The conditions&#13;
of most people in tribal areas are about the same as those of the rural&#13;
population in such countries as Kenya, Zambia, and Mozambique. Still, a&#13;
fairly developed social infrastructure (its benefits have gone to only a&#13;
few) provides an advantage to planners in Zimbabwe that most developing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
African countries did not enjoy at independence. The task of developing and&#13;
extending the social infrastructure and services in Zimbabwe, therefore, is&#13;
somewhat different from that of a typical African developing country.&#13;
In general, more resources are needed. Even where public expendi-&#13;
ture is high, more resources will have to be mobilized (through cost-recov-&#13;
ery) from programs that serve only a small section of the population: for&#13;
example, high-cost boarding schlools and private patients in Andrew Fleming&#13;
hospital.  If the government gradually reduces its support of these programs&#13;
and makes these special services self-financing, more resources will be avail-&#13;
able for the basic services needed to meet the needs of the majority of the&#13;
population.&#13;
Besides financing, two other important issues deserve attention.&#13;
First, the issue of quality versus coverage, whenever relevant, needs to be&#13;
resolved. For secondary education and primary health care, the issue is&#13;
irrelevant, because the access of the majority is negligible. Providing&#13;
access to them is the first order of business. What constitutes reasonable&#13;
quality in Zimbabwe, and what the operational definition of quality should&#13;
be, must be decided by the country's policymakers. The current high stan-&#13;
dards for entry to secondary education--they lead to only an 8 percent en-&#13;
rollment ratio--may not be relevant, for many postsecondary schools could&#13;
opt for midlevel technical training. Similarly, the qualification for be-&#13;
coming a primary health worker (ability to write and speak English) appears&#13;
to be irrelevant: the tasks they have to perform do not require these skills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
The other issue, of course, is how best to extend the delivery&#13;
system to rural areas. As noted, the existing organizations and personnel&#13;
have limited experience in tribal areas. Flexibility in the qualifications&#13;
of personnel to be recruited and in their training appears desirable. As&#13;
already noted for both health and teaching personnel, a conventional approach&#13;
to training in the transition period may be too slow to keep up with the need&#13;
for expansion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
2. Education and Training&#13;
A high primary enrollment ratio places Zimbabwe in the top third of African&#13;
countries. 1/ But the secondary-school enrollment ratio is low -- only 8&#13;
percent -- primarily because few Africans attend secondary school. 2/ There&#13;
are private and public (government) schools at both primary and secondary&#13;
levels. Some 83 percent of African primary students are enrolled in private&#13;
rural schools; the rest attend public schools. The public primary schools&#13;
have a lower dropout rate: 5 percent, compared with 45 percent in all primary&#13;
schools. The high dropout rates of private primary schools are partly due to&#13;
the higher pressure on students in those schools to join the labor market. In&#13;
addition, the quality of public schools is higher, as reflected in the higher&#13;
qualifications of the teaching staff. In these schools, almost all teachers&#13;
are fully qualified. In other schools, only one-fifth have adequate qualifi-&#13;
cations.&#13;
The difference in quality between private and public secondary&#13;
schools seems to be small. All teachers in the private secondary schools&#13;
are trained, and there is tight screening for entry to secondary schools.&#13;
Teachers are trained in seven Primary Teacher Training Colleges and one&#13;
Secondary Teacher Training College and, on a more limited scale, at the uni-&#13;
versity. The selection of trainees is stringent, and the level and quality&#13;
of training are high. Of the 2,726 teacher trainees in 1980, more than 90&#13;
percent were Africans and 55 percent were women.&#13;
1.   At independence, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, aad Zambia respectively had&#13;
primary school enrollment ratios of 53 percent, 25 percent, 48 percent,&#13;
and 54 percent, significantly lower than Zimbabwe.&#13;
2.   Both Kenya and Zambia have higher secondary enrollment ratios -- 19&#13;
percent and 16 percent respectively in 1980. Tanzania has a lower sec-&#13;
ondary-school enrollment ratio because of a deliberate policy to keep&#13;
the number of secondary-school graduates in line with manpower needs.&#13;

The Ministry of Education and Culture also provides nonformal courses&#13;
preparing for formal examinations to more than 18,000 students and community&#13;
development programs to an estimated 25,000 students. In addition, some 150&#13;
private centers, including those of the Adult Literacy Organization, enroll an&#13;
estimated 100,000 students annually in functional literacy, basic education,&#13;
and skill training programs.&#13;
Technical education is under the authority of the Ministry of Man-&#13;
power Planning -and Development. Training of skilled workers and technicians&#13;
is mainly provided through an apprenticeship system, supported by employers'&#13;
payroll taxes and workers' salary levies. The training programs include&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
include technical education in polyteclnic schools followed by practice on&#13;
the shop floor under the guidance of registered, highly skilled staff (jour-&#13;
neymen). In 1980, 2,440 students were enrolled in the two polytechnics.&#13;
The quality of the courses is high because the teachers have the requisite&#13;
qualifications and the curricula are job-oriented. Currently, about 4,800&#13;
former polytechnic students are going through practical training in seven&#13;
categories of industrial programs covering eighty trades. Of these appren-&#13;
tices, 24 percent are Africans. Although the proportion of Africans is still&#13;
modest, it represents substantial progress: only 575 African apprentices&#13;
were trained during 1961-76. The polytechnics also provide courses of their&#13;
own in commerce and secretarial skills (3,300 students), adult education (460&#13;
students), administration and management (760 part-time students), and super-&#13;
vision training to upgrade African skilled workers to foremen.&#13;
A number of small training centers have also been set up by private&#13;
firms and public agencies to meet their specific training needs. Higher tech-&#13;
nical education is provided by the university, which maintains close liaison&#13;
with the engineering profession. Administration and management training is&#13;
offered by the University, private institutes, the Zimbabwean Institute of&#13;
Management, and the Public Service Commission and Staff College of the Min-&#13;
istry of Public Service. The university is responsible for training medical&#13;
doctors and chemists, the Ministry of Health for training registered nurses,&#13;
village health workers, and medical, maternity, and health assistants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ADMINISTRATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM&#13;
Education is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Culture&#13;
(MOEC), which has four divisions: the Schools Education Division is respon-&#13;
sible for the development and assessment of curricula and teaching methods,&#13;
and for cultural affairs; the Education Administration and Services Division&#13;
manages staffing, planning, programming, evaluation, examinations, audiovisual&#13;
aids, and libraries; the Higher and Specialized Education Division focuses on&#13;
teacher training, student assistance, nonformal adult education, and community&#13;
development training; and the Administrative and Finance Division handles&#13;
legislation, personnel management, buildings and supplies, and budgeting and&#13;
finance.&#13;
The school and fee system. Although primary education is free (but&#13;
not compulsory), fees are charged for secondary education. According to the&#13;
1979 Education Act, secondary schools are classified as government schools,&#13;
independent community schools, and private schools (registered and unregis-&#13;
tered). Government schools are subdivided into groups with fees ranging from&#13;
US$180 to free tuition (in tribal areas). In community schools, fees may&#13;
amount to US$300, in exclusive urban private schools US$1,400 a year. The&#13;
government meets a major part of the recurrent costs of community schools&#13;
through grants. Most private schools are registered and aided by the gov-&#13;
ernment, which finances the aggregate of teachers' salaries and per capita&#13;
tuition and boarding grants.&#13;
Private education, encompassing 83 percent of primary and 49 per-&#13;
cent of secondary enrollments, accounts for an overwhelming share of the&#13;
education (table 2.1). Private education is managed by more than 600 agen-&#13;
cies, and 97 percent of the private schools are in rural areas. Only 467&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

the 6-to-12 age group, compounded by the return of about 900,000 displaced&#13;
persons, has resulted in an increase of more than 50 percent in primary en-&#13;
rollments -- from 820,000 in 1979 to 1,236,000 in 1980. This gives in an&#13;
enrollment ratio of 78 percent, which places Zimbabwe in the top third of&#13;
African countries in this respect. About 80 percent of seven-year olds are&#13;
admitted to Grade 1. Girls represent a high proportion of total enrollments&#13;
(47 percent). There are 28,162 primary teachers, resulting in an average&#13;
student-teacher ratio of 45:1. But about 8,000 teachers are untrained, and&#13;
about 12,000 are not fully qualified. The dropout rate reaches 45 percent&#13;
over the seven grades. The repetition rate is low because grade promotion&#13;
is automatic. The 36,000 non-African students represent less than 3 percent&#13;
of total enrollment. They are almost exclusively enrolled in the best govern-&#13;
ment and community schools, in which the student-teacher ratio averages 27:1&#13;
and the dropout rate is only 5 percent. Africans represent less than 13&#13;
percent and 8 percent of the respective enrollments of these schools. The&#13;
primary curriculum has recently been redesigned with practical objectives&#13;
better adapted to the local environment.&#13;
Secondary education. There were 74,300 secondary students enrolled&#13;
in 1980, representing a low enrollment ratio of 7.5 percent of the estimated&#13;
13-to-18 age group. The 54,000 African students (of whom 30,000 are in rural&#13;
areas) are enrolled in government schools and private schools. The 20,300&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
non-African students are mainly enrolled in the best government schools and&#13;
exclusive community schools in which Africans represent less than 10 percent&#13;
of enrollments. The quality of secondary education is good because of ade-&#13;
quate curricula and trained teachers. There are 3,737 teachers (of whom only&#13;
112 are untrained), resulting in a student:teacher ratio of 20:1. Even so,&#13;
the dropout rate reaches 45 percent over the junior secondary period among&#13;
African students, apparently because it is difficult to cope with school fees&#13;
and with high international educational standards. In addition, only 7 per-&#13;
cent of junior secondary graduates go on to senior secondary education; only&#13;
23 percent of primary leavers are admitted to secondary education. Academic&#13;
standards are high in secondary education, as is evident from the performance&#13;
of Zimbabwean secondary students in examinations externally administered. But&#13;
this also makes Zimbabwean secondary education expensive.&#13;
The enrollment ratio in primary schools in Zimbabwe is lower than&#13;
in other African countries. The present enrollment ratio in secondary schools&#13;
compares favorably with a few, but is lower than that in others (table 2.2).&#13;
The position of those countries at independence--some 15 to 17 years ago--was&#13;
not as good as that of Zimbabwe at independence.&#13;
Teacher training. In 1980, 2,049 primary and 677 secondary teacher&#13;
trainees were enrolled in seven Primary Teacher Training Colleges and one&#13;
Secondary Teacher Training College. Of these, 89 percent and 98 percent,&#13;
respectively, were Africans. The average annual output is about 700 primary&#13;
primary teachers and 200 secondary teachers. In addition, the Faculty of&#13;

Education at the university matriculated 75 graduate secondary teachers in&#13;
1979. The four public Primary Teacher Training Colleges (plus a fifth that&#13;
opened in January 1981) and the Secondary Teacher Training College are&#13;
associated with the Faculty of Education, which awards the Certificates of&#13;
Education.&#13;
Nonformal education. Nonformal institutions cater to an increasing&#13;
number of unschooled children and adults wanting the literacy and basic and&#13;
secondary education that they cannot gain through the formal system. In 1980&#13;
the Ministry of Education and Culture prepared about 14,500 students for the&#13;
London University (GCE)O and A levels and provided primary education to 3,800&#13;
displaced children through correspondence courses, study groups, and evening&#13;
courses. There are 147 study groups and 23 centers providing secondary educa-&#13;
tion, and 32 centers providing primary education. The Ministry also provides&#13;
community development training and in-service upgrading for local government&#13;
workers in five centers. And it sponsors four-year training courses preparing&#13;
local African council administrators for the Diploma in Local Government Admin-&#13;
istration at the National Training Center at Domboshawa. The annual student&#13;
turnover in the Ministry's programs is estimated at about 25,000. In addition,&#13;
more than 150 private centers provide literacy, basic education, and skill&#13;
training courses to an estimated 100,000 students annually, particularly in&#13;
rural areas. One of the most efficient is the Adult Literacy Organization,&#13;
which has produced an estimated 25,000 literate people and reached an annual&#13;
enrollment of about 12,000 (in 1980). The organization offers two-year part-&#13;
time courses linking literacy with agriculture, health, population education,&#13;
manual skills, homecraft, and community development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Agricultural education. Formal agricultural education and training&#13;
are the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture. Most graduates join&#13;
the extension and other specialized services of the Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
or those of the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement, and Rural Development. Four&#13;
public institutions offer agricuLtural education with an annual output of&#13;
200. These institutions provide high-standard training, given their highly&#13;
qualified teachers and practical curriculum. The number of applicants each&#13;
year is about ten times that of the available student places. A number of&#13;
private schools also provide somes agricultural training, but their standards&#13;
generally are lower than those of the Ministry of Agriculture's institutes.&#13;
Higher agricultural education is provided by the Faculty of Agricul-&#13;
ture at the University. Four-year Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degrees are&#13;
offered in agricultural production, soil science, crop science, animal science,&#13;
and agricultural economics.&#13;
Technical education and vocational training. The Ministry of Man-&#13;
power Planning and Development, through its Vocational Education and Training&#13;
Department, is responsible for technical schools with the assistance of the&#13;
Apprenticeship Training and Skil:Led Manpower Development Authority, an advisory&#13;
statutory body in charge of coordlinating all matters relating to skilled worker&#13;
and technician training (Apprenticeship); and the new Manpower Development and&#13;
Training Authority, an advisory and executive statutory body in charge of&#13;
planning, designing, evaluating, and stimulating technical education and voca-&#13;
tional training. The second authority coordinates its activities with the&#13;
government, employers, trade unions, and training institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Technical education and vocational training almost exclusively&#13;
consist of skilled worker (journeyman) and technician training. The high&#13;
standards of the City and Guilds of London Institute (CGLI) and the British&#13;
Chartered Institute of Secretaries (CIS) are applied to the national examina-&#13;
tions. Completion of Grades 10 to 12 is required for admission to appren-&#13;
ticeship. Apprenticeship and related activities are financially supported&#13;
through payroll taxes paid by employers and a levy on the personal salaries&#13;
of the workers concerned. All apprenticeship trainees are employed and&#13;
sponsored by their employers. The apprenticeship course is five years. For&#13;
skilled workers, it includes a one-year full-time "craft course," possibly&#13;
complemented by a second-year and even third-year part-time "advanced craft&#13;
course" in a government. polytechnic, followed by two to four years on the shop&#13;
floor. For technicians, the apprenticeship involves a three-to-four-year&#13;
course in a polytechnic, interrupted by in-plant practical sessions and&#13;
followed by one to two years' practice in industry.&#13;
The two polytechnics, one in Salisbury and one in Bulawayo, have a&#13;
total enrollment of 6,200, with 39 percent in industry, 53 percent in commerce,&#13;
5 percent in adult education, and 3 percent in maths and science programs for&#13;
middle and professional staff. A new polytechnic at Que Que expected to en-&#13;
roll 200 automotive, mechanical, and electrical engineering apprentices in&#13;
1981. In addition to polytechnic enrollments, 4,792 apprentices in 1980&#13;
received their on-the-job training in seven major categories of trades, in-&#13;
cluding aircraft maintenance, building, and engineering.&#13;
Higher technical education is offered by the Faculty of Engineer-&#13;
ing at the university -- in civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
electronic and power engineering. High-quality four-year B.Sc. degree&#13;
courses and postgraduate studies are available. In 1980 the twenty-nine&#13;
African students represented 44 percent of the enrollment in the Faculty of&#13;
Enginering. But this enrollment represented 5.5 percent of total university&#13;
enrollment, and the annual output. of the Faculty is still small with an aver-&#13;
age fifteen graduates.&#13;
The University. Established by royal charter in 1955, the University&#13;
of Zimbabwe has an excellent reputation. It applies the academic standards of&#13;
the University of London and, in medicine, the University of Birmingham. The&#13;
University is an autonomous institution financed through triennial grants from&#13;
the Treasury. In 1980 the total enrollment was 2,240 students in eight facul-&#13;
ties: 14 percent in arts, 14 percent in education, 17 percent in social stud-&#13;
ies, 23 percent in commerce and law, 9 percent in science, 13 percent in&#13;
medicine and pharmacy, 5.5 percent in engineering and 4.5 percent in agri-&#13;
culture. Of this enrollment, 63 percent were Africans and 22 percent were&#13;
women. The staffing included 318 established academic posts, of which 250&#13;
were filled. The average student-teacher ratio still was favorable at 9:1.&#13;
Tuition fees average US$400 a year (plus US$1,100 a year for board-&#13;
ing), and are high for African incomes. But in the last few years no quali-&#13;
fied student has been rejected by the university for lack of funds. About&#13;
70 percent of African full-time students and a number of African postgraduate&#13;
students are supported by financial grants from various sources. While this&#13;
support for qualified students from low-income family is desirable, there is&#13;
no justification for blanket support for all. Students from families with&#13;
higher incomes should pay the full cost, or even more, for university educa-&#13;
tion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
ISSUES&#13;
The coordination of formal and nonformal education and training -- the respon-&#13;
sibility of the five ministries, the University, and many private and public&#13;
agencies -- is inadequate. No long-term plan has emerged to implement the&#13;
government's general policy of abolishing ethnic and socieconomic discrimina-&#13;
tion and to give all groups access to good-quality education. No quantifica-&#13;
tion has been made of the long-term financial implications of the ongoing&#13;
reorganization of the educational system and curricular reform. In addition,&#13;
there is a severe shortage of African skilled middle-level staff and profes-&#13;
sionals in the administration of education.&#13;
The main challenge is to reconcile the time needed to reorganize and&#13;
reorient the present system and the extremely urgent necessity to provide the&#13;
majority in rural areas with education. There is an increasing dearth of edu-&#13;
cational opportunities relative to the demand, despite a 5.5 percent annual&#13;
increase in enrollments over the last decade. The merits of an additional&#13;
nonformal educational program, which could alleviate this pressure, are not&#13;
recognized, and this kind of education still is insufficiently developed.&#13;
Educational Financing&#13;
Public recurrent expenditure on education during 1974-79 grew less&#13;
than 5 percent a year in real terms, compared with about 10 percent for all&#13;
public recurrent expenditure. In 1980 that on education increased about 25&#13;
percent or twice as fast as all public recurrent expenditure. The public&#13;
recurrent expenditure on education and training was expected to have been&#13;
US$270 million in 1980, a 43 percent increase in nominal terms over the&#13;
previous year. Of this, the recurrent budget of the Ministry of Education&#13;
and Culture -- which has trebled in nominal terms over the last six years --&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
took about 90 percent. In the relationship between per capita income and&#13;
relative health expenditure in countries at Zimbabwe's per capita income,&#13;
Zimbabwe-is below the norm (figyure 2.1).&#13;
In 1980 African and non-African teachers' salaries were unified,&#13;
roughly doubling the average salary of African teachers. The average teacher's&#13;
salary is about US$11,000 a year, which is high for Africa. This adjustment,&#13;
compounded by the 1980 tidal wave in primary enrollment, resulted in a 45&#13;
percent increase in salary expenditures in nominal terms over the previous&#13;
year.&#13;
The establishment of free primary education in September 1980 and&#13;
the increase of grants to private secondary education to reduce fees paid&#13;
primarily by African families almost trebled the amount of grants to private&#13;
education students in 1980. If private school teachers' salaries are added,&#13;
subsidies to private education reached US$125 million in 1980, or about half&#13;
the ministry's recurrent costs. Free primary education alone is estimated to&#13;
have increased costs US$23 million.&#13;
The gross unit costs per student are: US$140 for primary, US$890&#13;
for secondary, US$2,900 for teacher training, and US$7,800 for the University.&#13;
While the unit cost for primary education is normal in the local context,&#13;
the other unit costs are similar to those in OECD countries. Fee revenues&#13;
were 7 percent of recurrent expenditure in 1979 and 5 percent in 1980. For&#13;
the University, fee revenues in 1979 met about 5 percent of recurrent expendi-&#13;
tures.&#13;
The private expenditure on education is not known. Of public recur-&#13;
rent expenditure, that on primary education, following its dramatic growth&#13;
in 1980, represented 62 percent of that on all education; secondary educa-&#13;
tion and teacher training, 27.5 percent; higher education, 6.5 percent; and&#13;

agricultural and vocational training, 3.5 percent (table 2.3).     This ex-&#13;
penditure was 16 percent of all public expenditure in 1980 -- compared with&#13;
13.3 percent in 1979, when the share of education in GNP was 4.6 percent.&#13;
If private financial contributions to the educational system are added, the&#13;
recurrent cost of education anl training is likely to be more than 5 percent&#13;
of GNP. This is high, in view of the low enrollment ratios in secondary edu-&#13;
cation and training. The system of resource allocation in education, evident&#13;
in table 2.2, deserves further scrutiny in the light of manpower needs and of&#13;
relative rates of return from ,lifferent educational subsectors. Much less is&#13;
spent on training--its relative share fell between 1979 and 1980--even though&#13;
there is a shortage of African technicians, which is likely to become more&#13;
serious.&#13;
Capital investment in education exceeded Z$5 million a year on aver-&#13;
age during 1975-79 (table 2.4). It represented 8.5 percent of total public&#13;
outlays in 1979 and is expected to reach 10 percent in FY 81. Its allocations&#13;
to primary, secondary, and technical education respectively are 32 percent,&#13;
42 percent, and 26 percent.&#13;
These rises in expenditure on the education sector -- more are&#13;
expected -- call for a policy of cost recovery from high-income beneficiaries.&#13;
This policy would be consistent with systems in other countries where high-&#13;
cost private schools with full fees run side-by-side with free public schools&#13;
for basic education.&#13;
Subsectors and Specific Issues&#13;
Primary Education. The tidal wave of enrollment in 1980 resulted in&#13;
overcrowding in many schools, mostly those in rural areas and in a few urban&#13;

districts with large African enrollments. Another result was a dramatic&#13;
rise in the proportion of unqualified teachers -- to 28 percent (8,000),&#13;
compared with 3 percent (500) in 1970. The lower quality of teaching has&#13;
reduced the quality and internal efficiency of education, shown by an in-&#13;
crease in the dropout rate, and has increased the disparity between urban&#13;
and rural areas.&#13;
Secondary education. The major issue in secondary education is the&#13;
low enrollment ratio of Africans. The main causes are insufficient facilities&#13;
and high fees, particularly in private schools, which African families cannot&#13;
generally afford. The fact that most Africans have to start working at an&#13;
early age reduces their already low enrollment ratios in secondary schools.&#13;
The streaming of students between the two parallel junior secondary&#13;
courses is done too early (immediately after primary education). It tends to&#13;
perpetuate the ethnic and socioeconomic disparities by retaining the high-&#13;
standard academic education for the few and reserving diversified practical&#13;
education for the majority. The new National Certificate of Education (NCE)&#13;
course is likely to provide a good opportunity for bright students to achieve&#13;
high performance.&#13;
High academic standards have their merit; they ensure the provision&#13;
of high-caliber professionals and executives. But if universally applied,&#13;
they result in the low internal efficiency of secondary education for African&#13;
students. The high-standards policy excludes a substantial number of qualified&#13;
young Africans from middle and higher levels of education and training, even&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
though there is a severe shortage of middle-level technical and managerial&#13;
skills.&#13;
Considering the poorer quality of primary education for Africans&#13;
and the difficulty they have in obtaining a secondary education, the inequity&#13;
in educational opportunities is great. This inequity cannot be eliminated&#13;
without reducing the economic disparities between rural and urban populations.&#13;
Teacher training. The system cannot cope with the estimated annual&#13;
increase in primary enrollments by 90,000 students. This would require&#13;
doubling the 3,780 available places in the eight primary teacher-training&#13;
colleges. The issue is compounded by the shortage of trainees, mainly due to&#13;
the incoumpatibility of their level of education and related job expectations&#13;
with their appointment in rural hardship areas. Although neither a manpower&#13;
training plan nor a related secondary education development plan is available,&#13;
the present secondary enrollment will probably quadruple by the end of the&#13;
decade. Even assuming that the Faculty of Education can expand its teacher&#13;
training program three to fouir times over the next ten years, the maximum&#13;
possible number of teachers who can be trained in present facilities would&#13;
not be enough to cope with the above enrollment increase.&#13;
Technical education and vocational training. The functions and&#13;
interrelationships of the responsible authorities and ministries have not&#13;
been fully clarified.    Yet to be published are a precise assessment of&#13;
overall manpower needs, a cornprehensive survey of training resources, and&#13;
a manpower development plan. There is no coordination between the small&#13;
dispersed training units set up by a number of firms, although group training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
could serve their common purposes more economically. The system can accommo-&#13;
date no more than about 4,000 new trainees a year, a small percentage of the&#13;
potential qualified applicants. Moreover, the output of the present system,&#13;
which cannot even cover present manpower needs (evident in the reported&#13;
shortage of mid-level technicians), is inadequate to cope with the expansion&#13;
of the economy (GNP is expected to grow at an annual rate of more than 7&#13;
percent during 1981-85) and the replacement of skilled emigrants.&#13;
A major constraint to the development of skill training is the&#13;
shortage of teachers at the polytechnics -- the private sector is more attrac-&#13;
tive financially. Rigidity in the public wages makes it difficult to pay&#13;
these teachers well. In addition, the emigration of skilled manpower is a&#13;
severe constraint to on-the-job apprenticeship. Also serious as constraints&#13;
are insufficient boarding and teaching facilities, shortages of spare parts,&#13;
and worn-out machinery. Training at the polytechnics might be improved and&#13;
expanded by introducing a block-release system in the first year, particularly&#13;
for industrial apprentices. But most industries in Zimbabwe are small and&#13;
could not easily adjust to this system, which employers fear would disrupt&#13;
production.&#13;
The general policy of requiring high academic standards to produce&#13;
highly skilled staff results in the lack of semiskilled workers to work as&#13;
specialized assistants to journeymen. This is an example of a serious gap&#13;
opened between the supply of and demand for specific skill categories by&#13;
inappropriate educational policies. Such policies result in less-than-opti-&#13;
mal use of skilled manpower and bar a large number of Africans from gainful&#13;
employment on the middle-level labor market. Trade unions are reluctant to&#13;
develop this category of semiskilled worker.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
Higher education. There is some difficulty in staffing the univer-&#13;
sity as required, mainly because of the civil war and continuing political&#13;
uncertainty. Ninety of the 318 established academic posts were vacant in&#13;
1980. Despite the reduction of vacancies through temporary appointments,&#13;
the vacancy rate still is 21 percent.&#13;
In the 1970s, enrollment in higher education increased 7 percent&#13;
a year because of the demand for higher education, the expansion of Form VI&#13;
classes, the award of many fellowships, and the diversification of subjects.&#13;
About 1,100.new students were expected to be admitted in 1981. Although&#13;
representing only a third of qualified applicants, this number is 24 percent&#13;
higher than that for 1980. University enrollment is expected to double in&#13;
the next five years. This will make worse the overcrowding of classes and&#13;
boarding facilities and the shortages of laboratories and equipment.&#13;
Other education. In nonformal education, a massive expansion is&#13;
needed to make up for the deficiencies of the formal system. Government&#13;
financial support to private agencies must be strong, since voluntary con-&#13;
tributions from private donors are inadequate. But there is little coordina-&#13;
tion among agencies, and no comprehensive survey has been made that would&#13;
permit selection of the most efficient agencies for priority assistance by&#13;
the government.&#13;
In agricultural education, shifting emphasis from high standard&#13;
research and extension work for 5,000 non-African and 9,000 African commercial&#13;
farmers to help about 800,000 subsistence farmers in tribal raises problems&#13;
because there are too few extension staff, too little local expertise about&#13;
subsistence farming, and too few training facilities. The high-standard&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
policy focusing only on highly skilled staff results in a lack of semiskilled&#13;
extension workers to serve as specialized assistants to extension agents and&#13;
in a waste of private school resources, which could be upgraded to training&#13;
centers for semiskilled workers.&#13;
In health education, the major issue is the emigration of non-African&#13;
doctors, chemists, and nurses. There are currently 800 doctors in medicine,&#13;
350 chemists, 4,243 nurses, and 4,908 medical and health assistants regis-&#13;
tered in Zimbabwe. It appears that the present number of graduates from&#13;
training institutions is insufficient to replace emigrants and manage the&#13;
necessary expansion of medical and health services. The issues are further&#13;
discussed in the chapter on health.&#13;
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND RESOURCES REQUIRED&#13;
No comprehensive development plan has been completed, but a short-term devel-&#13;
opment program was established for FY1980-81. It includes the construction&#13;
of twenty-four primary schools and seventeen secondary schools; the expansion&#13;
of two primary schools, six secondary schools, and three teacher-training&#13;
colleges; the implementation of an emergency training scheme--in which UNICEF&#13;
is expected to participate--to substantially reduce the number of unqualified&#13;
primary teachers within about three years; the expansion of double-shifting&#13;
in primary education (sixty-five schools, mainly in urban areas, have already&#13;
adopted this system); and the expansion of informal programs of education and&#13;
literacy.&#13;
As for the expected trends of enrollments and needs, the annual&#13;
increase in primary enrollments is expected to average 90,000 a year during&#13;
the early 1980s, requiring about 3,000 new primary teachers annually, more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
than three times as many as currently are graduated; a fourfold increase of&#13;
present secondary enrollments, resulting mainly from the estimated quadrupling&#13;
of current enrollment in the Grade 8-10 NCE course, is likely in the second&#13;
half of the decade. Therefore, there would be about 300,000 students in&#13;
secondary schools--of whom about: two-thirds would be in Grades 8 to 10--&#13;
requiring about 12,000 teachers. This means that about 9,000 new teachers&#13;
will have to be trained in the next ten years. If it is assumed that a third&#13;
of these teachers could be trained at the University and through channels&#13;
other than teacher training colleges, the increase would still require a&#13;
more than doubling of the present capacity of secondary teacher training&#13;
colleges. In addition, the government is likely to adopt a goal to eradi-&#13;
cate illiteracy over the coming decade. On the basis of a 1976 report by&#13;
the Whitsun Foundation, it is estimated that about 4,000 specialized instruc-&#13;
tors would be required to provide an estimated 2,000,000 illiterates with&#13;
functional literacy over a ten-year period.&#13;
The government estimates that by the end of the decade about 6,000&#13;
extension agents and 600 extension officers will be required to improve exten-&#13;
sion services for an estimated 1,200,000 farmers on tribal lands and 13,000 on&#13;
African Purchase Lands. To reach this goal, the government plans to expand&#13;
the intake in the existing facilities. But even after the proposed expansion,&#13;
the number of graduates of the agricultural institutes will barely reach half&#13;
the need.&#13;
The government's awareness of the need to expand technical educa-&#13;
tion is reflected in the 46 percent increase in the vocational training budget&#13;
for FY80-81.  The government also intends to establish a network of Vocational&#13;
Training Centers for semiskilled training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
The University intends to expand and diversify its subjects and,&#13;
despite restrictive admission practices, total enrollment is expected at&#13;
least to double in the next five years. University authorities intend to&#13;
cope with the expansion and improvement by providing new academic and boarding&#13;
facilities; library, printing, and computer services; and laboratories and&#13;
research units. The capital investment required for such infrastructure can&#13;
be estimated at about US$18 million. Although no precise assistance pattern&#13;
has been set up, bilateral and multilateral agencies and local professions are&#13;
expected to assist the University in its development plans.&#13;
The resource requirements of the government's plans and decisions in&#13;
the education sector cannot be accurately estimated for want of information.&#13;
Moreover, the government has yet to finalize the plan. On the basis of avail-&#13;
able information, however, some estimates of the cost can be made, and these&#13;
turn out to be staggering.&#13;
The following estimates of recurrent costs are for FY1985. They&#13;
are rough and do not take into account the capital costs, probably important,&#13;
implied by the development plans.&#13;
*    Primary education.   After the government's decision to increase&#13;
African teachers' salaries to Z$7,000 a year (US$11,200), the new&#13;
unit cost, given a pupil teacher ratio of 45:1, will be US$250,&#13;
plus 10 percent for other recurrent costs, or approximately US$275.&#13;
There are 1,200,000 pupils now, and 90,000 new pupils are expected&#13;
each year, so 1,650,000 will be enrolled in 1985. That works out&#13;
to US$453.8 million, which gives an additional cost of US$350.9&#13;
million over that in 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
*    Primary teacher training.   The doubling of' 3,780 available places&#13;
in the eight teacher training colleges (at US$2,900) will cost US$11&#13;
million more a year.&#13;
*    Secondary teacher training.    The quadrupling of students in the&#13;
Faculty of Education will add 950 freshmen. At US$7,800 a year,&#13;
that gives an added cost of US$7.1 million.&#13;
v    Nonformal education.   'he training of two million illiterate adults&#13;
in ten years will require at least two years of nonformal education&#13;
for each, which means 400,000 adults enrolled for a given year.&#13;
Experiments with functional literacy programs have shown that the&#13;
unit cost is rarely beLow that for primary education. If the unit&#13;
cost is US$300, a conservative estimate, the cost of this program&#13;
will be US$120 million a year.&#13;
*    Secondary education.   Quadrupling enrollment will add 222,900 new&#13;
students. At US$890, the added cost would be US$198.4 million.&#13;
O    Higher education.   A doubling of university students (Faculty of&#13;
Education excluded) wiLl add 1,926 students. At US$7,800, the&#13;
added cost would be US$15 million a year.&#13;
It was not possible to estimate the costs of agricultural, technical, voca-&#13;
tional, and health education, bui: those are likely to be high, too.&#13;
Total new costs (in miLlion for FY 1985):&#13;
Primary   -   teacher training         US$10.96&#13;
-  new pupils                 350.87&#13;
Secondary - teacher training               7.14&#13;
- new pupils                   198.38&#13;
Higher education                          15.00&#13;
Nonformal education                      120.00&#13;
Total                                 US$702.35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
That represents a 2.6-fold increase over the 1980 budget, which was 4.6 percent&#13;
of the GNP. If economic growth can be optimistically assumed at 40 percent&#13;
between 1980 and 1985, the proportion of GNP allocated to public sector educa-&#13;
tion would be nearly 12 percent in 1985. No country has such a high proportion&#13;
of GNP going to public sector education, and this obviously would be too great&#13;
a burden for the government. That means the government will have to revise&#13;
the plans or choose among competing educational goals. The government will&#13;
also have to pursue a policy of cost recovery -- and, if possible, cross sub-&#13;
sidization by demand pricing for different services for the high-income group.&#13;

3. Health, Nutrition, and Sanitation&#13;
As in most aspects of its citizen's lives, Zimbabwe presents a dichotomous&#13;
picture of health. Health conditions for the Africans are significantly dif-&#13;
ferent from those surrounding the European and Asian minority. Similar to&#13;
those of a typical underdeveloped country, the health conditions of Africans&#13;
are largely affected by poor nutrition and poor sanitation, usually from&#13;
contaminated water, which aggravates the incidence of communicable diseases.&#13;
The minority (5 percent) has health conditions similar to those in many devel-&#13;
oped countries. They suffer from degenerative diseases that can often be&#13;
attributed to the environment but that are markedly different from what most&#13;
Africans endure.&#13;
This chapter reviews the health sector in Zimbabwe and examines the&#13;
two main causes of health problEms in the country--nutritional deficiencies&#13;
and poor environmental sanitation. The review of the health sector focuses&#13;
on the status of health services and the future of programs and policies for&#13;
health care. The review includes a discussion of major issues in developing&#13;
health services, including the fiscal implications of present and future&#13;
health sector expenditure for the economy and for the government budget.&#13;
HEALTH&#13;
The best indicators of disease levels and patterns are the registered causes&#13;
of death, and inpatient and outpatient data from various health facilities&#13;
(tables 3.1 and 3.2). Mortality reporting includes only urban and European&#13;
farm areas. In that sense, the data in table 3.1 give a partial picture,&#13;
though they make clear that the major causes of death are significantly&#13;

different between Africans and non-Africans. The morbidity data also relate&#13;
predominantly to the urban and European farm areas. Only the data from rural,&#13;
primary health clinics indicate the health status of the TTL population.&#13;
The disease profile of Zimbabwe's African population is similar to&#13;
that in other African countries, such as Kenya, Malawi, and Tanzania. Data on&#13;
causes for attending outpatient facilities in those three countries in the&#13;
mid-1970s show that the incidence of diarrhea and dysentery among Africans is&#13;
higher in Zimbabwe than in Tanzania (3 percent), comparable to that in Malawi&#13;
(8 percent) and lower than in Kenya (26 percent). Of the other water-related&#13;
diseases, the incidence of bilharzia in Zimbabwe is lower than in Malawi (8&#13;
percent), but comparable to that in Tanzania and Kenya. As for malaria,&#13;
another water-related disease, the incidence in Zimbabwe is similar to that in&#13;
Tanzania, but much lower than in Malawi and Kenya.&#13;
Of the air-borne diseases, the incidence rate of pneumonia among&#13;
the outpatients at health facilities is comparable to Zimbabwe. But Zimbabwe&#13;
has a surprisingly-higher incidence of measles than what is reported in&#13;
Malawi, Tanzania, or Kenya (table 3.3).&#13;
Poverty is the real cause of ill health among the African population&#13;
in Zimbabwe. In Salisbury, 80 percent of African workers receive wages&#13;
below the basic needs standards. In 1976, 85 percent of all African workers&#13;
received less than Z$20.00 a month; the income needed to reach the basic needs&#13;
standards is Z$27.00. The biggest advancement in health would, therefore,&#13;
come from improvement in the physical level of living of most Zimbabweans. If&#13;
per capita food availability increases, the general nutritional and health&#13;
status of the people will improve. With better access to safe water, the&#13;

incidence of water-related:diseases would significantly decrease. Better&#13;
sanitation also is crucial.&#13;
Nutritional Deficiencies&#13;
The availability of food in Zimbabwe is satisfactory. But the&#13;
staple food-crop production rose an average of 3 percent a year during 1961-&#13;
76, compared with an annual population growth rate of 3.8 percent. The&#13;
dietary energy supplies for 1969-71 were 11 percent above daily require-&#13;
ments, which was better than that in most African countries. Although the&#13;
patterns differ greatly between the European and African populations, the&#13;
total picture for Zimbabwe compares favorably with other African countries.&#13;
Some groups have less than the minimum requirement of calories, but starva-&#13;
tion is rare. The per capita protein supply, however, is significantly less&#13;
than the requirement, even in the aggregate.&#13;
The link between infection and nutritional deficiency is most&#13;
evident among children. For example, if measles and malnutrition occur&#13;
together, the result often is fatal. Many deaths result from measles in&#13;
Zimbabwe. Professor J.H.M. Axton (1979) of the University of Zimbabwe cited&#13;
strong evidence that among undernourished children in Zimbabwe an attack of&#13;
measles precipitates overt malnutrition. The malnutrition is triggered&#13;
by an increased need for protein and energy and a decrease in the intake of&#13;
food through anorexia and through direct or indirect effects on the small&#13;
and large bowels. For well-nourished children who receive adequate diets&#13;
during the attack of measles, the-effects are probably minimal and transient.&#13;
For the undernourished, who may be inadequately fed during the acute phase of&#13;
the disease and who may return to a diet with marginal amounts of energy&#13;
and protein after the illness, the effects are more prolonged. A diet just&#13;

adequate for growth before an illness may. become inadequate during the recov-&#13;
ery phase. The child then needs protein and energy for the repair of damaged&#13;
tissues and protein lost from the body, in addition to the normal requirements&#13;
for growth.&#13;
A localized health and nutrition survey, taken in 1972 in Que Que&#13;
Tribal Trust Land, produces some evidence about the nutritional status among&#13;
children and the important correlates of the lack of nutrition in the area.&#13;
The results of the survey showed that almost 40 percent of school children&#13;
were below the 10th percentile of height-for-age Harvard standards. This&#13;
suggested a severe problem of health and nutrition among the children, and&#13;
the problem was strongly relat:ed to poverty. Families were divided into&#13;
five categories with regard to arable land used and number of livestock owned.&#13;
Nutritional status was strongly correlated with both factors. About 71 per-&#13;
cent of the children from fam:ilies in the lowest category were below the 10th&#13;
percentile of the Harvard standards. Corresponding figures for the next two&#13;
higher categories were 55 and 40 percent. Even the highest category had&#13;
25 percent of children under the 10th percentile.&#13;
The study also founcd that the migration of the father to adjoining&#13;
cities for wage earning had a negative effect on the nutritional status of&#13;
children. The man's absence made it impossible to cultivate more land and&#13;
maintain many livestock. Unlike some other African countries where women do&#13;
most of the subsistence agriculture (for example, Kenya), the absence of men&#13;
in Zimbabwe seems to have an effect on subsistence farming and cattle raising.&#13;
The losses from their absence in subsistence production are not fully compen-&#13;
sated for by wages in providing for the nutrition of children. It also was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
found that educational level of family heads had significant positive effect&#13;
on family nutrition and health, even after controlling for income. The study&#13;
thus shows that poverty is the most important factor in causing nutritional&#13;
deficiencies, but the education of parents can help somewhat.&#13;
The International Red Cross took a preliminary survey in "protected&#13;
villages" during September-October 1979. 1/ The survey is based on a sample&#13;
of 698 (from the estimated child population of about 3,500), and revealed&#13;
that, among the children aged one to five, 4 percent were severely malnour-&#13;
ished and 19 percent were malnourished. Kwashiorkor was found in 52 percent&#13;
of the severely malnourished. When the sample size was extended to include&#13;
children aged six to nine because of the observable high prevalence of pro-&#13;
tein-energy malnutrition, the figures increased to 5 percent for severely mal-&#13;
nourished and 22 percent for malnourished. The report also suggested that the&#13;
problem is energy deficiency rather than pure protein deficiency. Although&#13;
preliminary -- its results must be used with caution -- the report shows that&#13;
the prevalence of the protein-energy malnutrition is rather high, especially&#13;
for a country self-sufficient in food. Rounding up people in protected vil-&#13;
lages and cutting them off from their agricultural land and wage-earning&#13;
opportunities are perhaps the reasons for the higher prevalence.&#13;
1.   Protected villages were designated such after villagers from wider areas&#13;
were put there in temporary shelter and protected by the army during the&#13;
internal strife. After independence, people returned to their original&#13;
villages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Water and Environmental Sanitation&#13;
The importance of safe drinking water and sanitation in the control&#13;
of such diseases as diarrhea, typhoid and paratyphoid fever, cholera, infec-&#13;
tious hepatitis, and bilharzia is well established. That these diseases are&#13;
widespread in rural Zimbabwe indicates a serious problem of water supply and&#13;
environmental sanitation.&#13;
In the cities and most rural council areas where the population is&#13;
predominantly non-African, the water supply is from piped connections and&#13;
sanitation is waterborne. In the tribal areas 99 percent of the water supply&#13;
comes from boreholes fitted with hand pumps; sanitation has remained primitive&#13;
except for a few pit latrines, which are only a slight improvement over no&#13;
sanitation.&#13;
There are about 2,500 boreholes in tribal areas, each one providing&#13;
for the inhabitants of about 66.6 square kilometers. (African Purchase Land--&#13;
where Africans can own land--has 343 boreholes, each covering an average 30.3&#13;
square kilometers.) On average, safe drinking water is available within three&#13;
miles for 80 percent of the rural population, according to one estimate. But&#13;
this average is misleading because of wide regional disparity. Wells thus are&#13;
a familiar water source in the rural areas of Zimbabwe, but many of these are&#13;
unprotected and do not provide pure water. Local public health officials say&#13;
that when wells are protected and fitted with standard hand pumps, water qual-&#13;
ity is often excellent and eagerly sought by the villagers. The standard hand&#13;
pump is designed to pump water from wells at least 50 feet deep; this requires&#13;
levers and water tight washers. These two parts wear out most easily, espe-&#13;
cially if conditions are unfa-vorable or if the facility is abused. Although&#13;
regular repair work becomes necessary, no local agency can do it. Thus many&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
of these tubewells can be out of order for a long time, causing shortages of&#13;
drinking water in the villages.&#13;
In rural areas, access to safe water seems to be a serious problem&#13;
and accounts for many serious diseases. In rural Zimbabwe, a large number of&#13;
people suffer from water-associated diseases; in 1978 more than 12 percent of&#13;
the instances of morbidity were attributable to gastroenteritis and other&#13;
diarrheal diseases. Among infants there is a large proportion of cases of&#13;
diarrhea. Cholera epidemics also are frequent. Solving the problem of safe,&#13;
adequate, and accessible water supplies, together with good sanitation, would&#13;
mean considerable progress in meeting the basic health needs in Zimbabwe. The&#13;
Ministry of Water Development estimates that the aims of the U.N. Water Decade&#13;
could be met by providing everyone with potable water in the rural areas at a&#13;
total cost of about Z$500 million in 1980 prices. 1/&#13;
In sharp contrast to the urban areas, the rural tribal areas have&#13;
little sanitation. Only a few have deep pit latrines. These are cheap to&#13;
build, easy to use, and require little maintenance, but they also have a&#13;
serious disadvantage as sites where flyborne diseases are transmitted. In&#13;
1976 a ventilated privy was developed to provide complete protection against&#13;
flies and odors without use of water or chemicals. The method is still being&#13;
tested. Such devices must be developed for the rural areas to provide more&#13;
adequate sanitary facilities and reduce the causes of many serious diseases.&#13;
The foregoing observations imply that a plan to improve general&#13;
health status of people in Zimbabwe must extend beyond the delivery of health&#13;
services. The plan should include measures to encourage and coordinate the&#13;

work 'of other sectors in promoting factors that improve health and in elimi-&#13;
nating those that do not. In particular, strategies for community develop-&#13;
ment, agricultural development, better housing and general education, and&#13;
more health information and education are essential complements to the health&#13;
care delivery system.&#13;
HiEALTH SERVICES&#13;
In many developing countries the health infrastructure has an urban bias; the&#13;
Zimbabwean system is extreme. The health status of the non-African population&#13;
in Zimbabwe and the services they have access to are comparable to those found&#13;
in any developed society.   The health conditions of the African population and&#13;
their access to health services are in sharp contrast. The new Andrew Fleming&#13;
Hospital in Salisbury has the most developed facilities in Africa; yet, in&#13;
most African areas--such as the Tribal Trust Lands--health facilities are rudi-&#13;
mentary and compare unfavorably even with those in such countries as Kenya.&#13;
There are five different providers of health services in Zimbabwe.&#13;
These are the central governmeni: through the Ministry of Health (MOH); volun-&#13;
tary agencies, usually church hospitals and clinics for the rural population;&#13;
local authorities--urban and rural (mainly African) councils; industrial&#13;
medical services; and the private sector.&#13;
Table 3.4 presents the number of beds in MOH health facilities and&#13;
the population that these facil:Lties are designed to serve. Four large modern&#13;
hospitals are in the two major cities, Salisbury and Bulawayo. Previously,&#13;
one hospital in each city was earmarked for Africans. Eleven general hospitals&#13;
with approximately 250 beds each are in smaller towns. These general hospitals&#13;

are at the administrative headquarters of a province or a district. The MOH&#13;
also manages twenty-nine district hospitals each with approximately 100 beds&#13;
and fifty-eight small, rural hospitals. Zimbabwe has seven hospitals special-&#13;
izing in specific diseases, such as leprosy, tuberculosis, and mental illness.&#13;
The smallest health facilities reaching the rural people are 300 rural health&#13;
clinics, also known as primary health care centers.&#13;
Until 1980 the MOH had a restricted role in the rural areas. Mis-&#13;
sionary clinics, some of them flnded by MOH, were responsible for 60 percent&#13;
of the hospital beds in TTL areas. (Some 2,600 of the 3,560 beds were origi-&#13;
nally provided by the mission hospitals.) Since September 1980 the MOH has&#13;
been assigned the full financial responsibility for running the local clinics&#13;
and mission health facilities.    National coverage is 2 beds for every 1,000&#13;
people now. But in the rural areas, a quick calculation shows that there are&#13;
only 1.7 beds per 1,000. Taking into account original MOH facilities, the&#13;
figure is 0.5 beds per 1,000 population, compared with 3.3 beds for the urban&#13;
population. A comparison with other selected countries in Africa shows that&#13;
Zimbabwe is better off in the ratio of medical personnel to population (table&#13;
3.5). But given the wide disparity between the urban and rural areas in&#13;
Zimbabwe (which generally is wider than that in other African countries), the&#13;
conditions on rural tribal lands appear to be worse than in such countries as&#13;
Kenya and Zambia.&#13;
Currently, the problem of limited health facilities was made worse&#13;
by war damage, particularly in rural areas. From the MOH list, an estimated&#13;
60 percent of the rural clinics are out of commission, and many missionary&#13;
hospitals have been closed down or were abandoned. An urgent need exists&#13;

to restore these damaged facilities. But some are so badly run down that&#13;
construction of a new clinic in the same site appears to be more desirable.&#13;
The government has drawn up a plan to repair these damaged health facilities,&#13;
and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has initiated dis-&#13;
cussions about financing their rieconstruction.&#13;
To meet the health needs of the majority of the population, major&#13;
changes are required in the structure, orientation, and functioning of the&#13;
health delivery system. The changes will not be easy, however. I will&#13;
return to their requirements later in the chapter -- after outlining the&#13;
general directions for the futurie development of health services. These&#13;
directions appear desirable given the status of health delivery system and the&#13;
stated commitment of the government to meet the health needs of the majority.&#13;
Future Directions&#13;
Several points about the future development of health services&#13;
should be emphasized. First, thes sectoral approach to health problems and&#13;
needs, which largely characterizes the present health delivery system, will&#13;
not help meet the health needs of the majority.   A multisectoral program --&#13;
involving various ministries, private organizations, and local government&#13;
institutions -- is needed to promote health and to develop effective health&#13;
services. The MOH must, therefore, motivate and coordinate the health-related&#13;
activities of other sectors to achieve a better health for the population.&#13;
Better sanitation and water, more adequate nutrition for the majority, and&#13;
decent housing are some of the prerequisites for better health. To achieve&#13;
those objectives, collaboration with other agencies of development -- welfare,&#13;
housing, water supply, rural development, public works, information (and edu-&#13;
cation) -- are critically important.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
Second, the current health delivery system is fragmented. The cen-&#13;
tral government and rural council facilities, mission hospitals, private&#13;
practitioners, voluntary organizations, and mining and industrial hospitals&#13;
provide useful service but do not coordinate their activities at the provin-&#13;
cial level. Even within the MOH health delivery system, the general hospitals&#13;
are controlled and supervised by MOH headquarters in Salisbury. Provincial&#13;
medical officers working at the provincial headquarters are responsible only&#13;
for preventive health care. A similar dichotomy between curative and preven-&#13;
tive health extends to the district level and below. In the future, coordi-&#13;
nating bodies at the provincial and district levels will be needed in a&#13;
pyramidal system of primary health care.&#13;
Third, a system of primary health care has to be developed to cover&#13;
both prevention and curative services. This means a massive extension of basic&#13;
health facilities in rural areas, and the integration of these facilities into&#13;
the health system hierarchy. At the lowest level, the capability to deal with&#13;
the most common health problems will have to be developed. Primary health&#13;
care centers will constitute the lowest level of a properly designed health-&#13;
care pyramid.&#13;
Fourth, much more needed is emphasis on preventive measures because,&#13;
along with primary health care, these are the most cost effective forms of&#13;
health provision. In 1978-79, preventive services accounted for only 9 per-&#13;
cent of the health budget, compared with 87 percent for treatment, despite&#13;
the fact that according to MOh sources 90 percent of the diseases in Zimbabwe&#13;
are preventable. In the future, the village health workers, in addition to&#13;
diagnosing and treating simple, common diseases, will have to educate the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
community in nutrition, hygiene, and personal health care.     The health worker,&#13;
being from the community, will enjoy the confidence and acceptance of the&#13;
community.&#13;
Fifth, the central, general, and district hospitals will have to&#13;
serve more as referral hospitals. Currently, referred patients constitute&#13;
only a small part of the patients served. Several factors are responsible:&#13;
the pyramidal system has not been developed with a large number of primary&#13;
health workers; the road infrastructure and health infrastructure have left&#13;
out many population groups without access even to a primary health clinic;&#13;
traditional practitioners offer cheap, eatily accessible care. Although not&#13;
effective, many rural people avail themselves of traditional care and never&#13;
come in touch with modern medicine. Although having the large hospitals&#13;
generally serve as referral hospitals is desirable as a future direction,&#13;
the system of providing services directly to patients who want specialized&#13;
services while in the care of a private physician can continue, if these&#13;
direct services are fully financed by the fees charged to direct users.&#13;
Sixth, while the principle of freedom to choose private health care&#13;
has to be respected, those who choose it should pay for it. In Zimbabwe,&#13;
the government subsidizes 90 percent of the health services used by the high-&#13;
income group at hospitals. In 1979 services at Andrew Fleming Hospital were&#13;
subsidized Z$31.3 per patient unit. This amount is much higher than the&#13;
average subsidy paid for patient: units In district hospitals (Z$1.8 to Z$5.4&#13;
per patient unit). In the future, the benefits of the health services will&#13;
have to be equitably distributed, and subsidies going in the wrong direction&#13;
will have to be corrected. Specifically, the government should pursue a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -.&#13;
policy of charging full-cost fees to private patients in urban hospitals.&#13;
These special services should gradually become self-financing and even gener-&#13;
ate a surplus to help finance the health services benefiting the majority of&#13;
the population.&#13;
Issues in Health Services Development&#13;
Level of expenditure. The question of the desirable level of health&#13;
sector expenditure in an economy is complex, and no attempt is made here to&#13;
answer that question for the Zimbabwean economy. Nevertheless, a comparative&#13;
picture of health expenditure in Zimbabwe and a few African countries is pro-&#13;
vided, considering only government expenditures on health. Government outlays&#13;
on health in low-income countries seldom exceed 2 percent of GNP (World Bank,&#13;
Health Sector Policy Paper, p. 37). In twenty-two selected developing coun-&#13;
tries, government expenditure on health comes to only $1 per capita, compared&#13;
with $231 for six selected industrial countries. Although the need presumably&#13;
is much greater, per capita health expenditure is lower even in a relative&#13;
sense in developing countries.&#13;
Taking into account the entire population, per capita public ex-&#13;
penditure on health is US$8, on the low side compared with the per capita GNP&#13;
level of Zimbabwe in relation to other African countries (see table 3.6). The&#13;
percentage of GNP spent on health (or of the government budget on health) is&#13;
generally comparable to other African countries. In the relationship between&#13;
per capita income and relative health expenditure in countries at Zimbabwe's&#13;
per capita income, Zimbabwe is below the norm (figure 3.1).&#13;

Data on private sector expenditure on health are scarce. In poor&#13;
countries, these expenditures are low, even as a percentage of household in-&#13;
come. According to the Urban African Budget Survey in Salisbury in 1969,&#13;
average household expenditure on health was Z$0.36 per month, less than 1&#13;
percent of income. Similar private expenditures on health were found in two&#13;
other urban African budget surveys--one in Bulawayo in 1968 and another in&#13;
Umtali in 1971.&#13;
For the European population of Zimbabwe, the private per capita&#13;
expenditure on health in the mid-1970s was about Z$13.00 per household a&#13;
month; 1/ the figure is low relative to per capita income (only about 2&#13;
percent of income, significantly lower than in most developed countries).&#13;
If health expenditure is disaggregated by public and private sources, an&#13;
interesting picture emerges about the non-African population relative to&#13;
some developed countries (with which the per capita income of the Zimbabwean&#13;
non-African population can be compared). First, per capita expenditure seems&#13;
to be low; but public expenditure is comparatively high (in 1979 Z$63.4 per&#13;
capita per year, compared with Z$5.6 per capita per year for African popula-&#13;
tion), implying a large element of public subsidy for the health care of the&#13;
non-African population.&#13;
The usual arguments for increased expenditure on health in the&#13;
developing countries are recorded elsewhere and apply strongly to Zimbabwe&#13;
1.   This is based on the European Expenditure Survey, 1975-76, taken in&#13;
Salisbury, Bulawayo, Umtali, and Gwelo.&#13;

situation. 1/ First, morbidity reduces labor supply and productivity. In&#13;
Zimbabwe, certain debilitating diseases, such as malaria and schistosomiasis,&#13;
must have adversely affected labor supply and productivity. Second, disease&#13;
leads to wastage. Infections lead to extra metabolic demands for more food&#13;
energy, or the loss of intestinal absorption of food leads to wastage. Serious&#13;
waste follows from the expenditure of real resources on treatment. If diseases&#13;
are prevented, resources used on treatment can be saved for the productive sec-&#13;
tors. Third, the incidence of epidemic or infectious diseases can impede de-&#13;
velopment of resources. In certain areas malaria hinders agricultural devel-&#13;
opment projects. In Zimbabwe, malaria is not serious, but improvements in&#13;
health in the lower southeast area will open more intensive cultivation of&#13;
land in tribal or newly settled areas. Fourth, and most important, better&#13;
health is needed for balanced socioeconomic development. Health facilitates&#13;
development and helps the beneficiaries of development to enjoy it.&#13;
Budgetary burden and the financing of health services. The budget&#13;
allocation for the fiscal year 1981 is Z$83.7 million, which is 55 percent&#13;
higher than fiscal year 1980. The unusually high increase is caused by the&#13;
recent change in policy regarding fees for services rendered (table 3.7).&#13;
Before September 1980, a fee-for-service principle prevailed: a payment was&#13;
required for all types of treatment and consultations. Most drugs had to be&#13;
purchased, but fees provided less than 10 percent of the running costs; the&#13;
rest was paid by MOH.&#13;
1.   World Bank, Health Sector Policy Paper.   It is implicit here that in-&#13;
creased expenditure would be in the high priority areas -- primary health&#13;
care and prevention -- and that these expenditures would be accompanied&#13;
by adequate programs in other sectors, especially water and sanitation.&#13;

The MOH now has complete responsibility for the cost of running&#13;
the clinics and the government-aided mission hospitals.    Another change&#13;
in September 1980 made all services free for those earning Z$150.00 a month&#13;
or less. That covers almost all rural Africans and most urban Africans. The&#13;
exact financial implications of this policy change have not been worked out,&#13;
but the increase in allocation reflects the anticipated rise of the govern-&#13;
ment's fiscal burden in health.&#13;
Free medical care for the poor is a laudable goal and must be pur-&#13;
sued. Even if theoretically nobody would be denied medical care for want of&#13;
payment when fees were to be charged to all, the required payment could dis-&#13;
courage many low income families from seeking health care. But free medical&#13;
care for all who need it cannot be pursued without regard for the quality of&#13;
service. If quality deteriorates, the goal of free medical care for the needy&#13;
may become meaningless. Therefore, the government should pursue both goals so&#13;
that progress can be achieved and sustained. The point is illustrated by the&#13;
Salisbury group of hospitals, which include the Andrew Fleming Hospital.&#13;
The government bears more than 90 percent of the cost (including&#13;
overhead) of the hospitals. Hospital charges do not even cover 10 percent&#13;
of recurrent costs in most cases (see table 3.8). The government has borne&#13;
72 percent of the average cost of hospital services of the Andrew Fleming&#13;
Hospital. The grant to that one hospital accounts for 12.5 percent of the&#13;
Ministry of Health's budget; yet the hospital serves only 1.4 percent of the&#13;
total population. Taking only the Salisbury group of hospitals, the propor-&#13;
tion of the budget of MOH going to the group is 35.4 percent, but the popula-&#13;
tion served is only 8.9 percent of the total population.&#13;

The wealthy clientele using Arthur Fleming Hospital would have paid&#13;
almost four to five times as much if they had received medical care from pri-&#13;
vate clinics. If the price of services were raised to the full average cost&#13;
for those who can afford to pay, the price would still be lower than what&#13;
they would have paid for the service in the private sector. In fact, private&#13;
sector service is often inferior to the specialized service available from&#13;
Andrew Fleming, which has facilities not often available in private clinics.&#13;
Pricing the services equal to or even more than the average operat-&#13;
ing cost for those who can and are willing to pay is rational.      Medical aid&#13;
(insurance) societies should be persuaded to raise their prices for medical&#13;
care to a level that would support the average rising cost of services. Pri-&#13;
vate practitioners should be charged the full cost for the use of hospital&#13;
services. That way, many of the high-standard hospital services could bring&#13;
higher revenues and meet a substantial part of their cost. At first, the&#13;
system could be introduced only at Andrew Fleming. (This does not imply that&#13;
the facility will not be available to the needy poor. For the unpaying poor,&#13;
the government can pay the hospital on a full-cost basis.) The hospital would&#13;
run more or less commercially, charging full (average) cost prices to the&#13;
users, who would pay either through the medical aid societies or through the&#13;
grant from the government. This would relieve much of the government budget's&#13;
burden of running hospitals.&#13;
Organization and personnel. The issue of how to extend the govern-&#13;
mental organization to rural areas and have the number of personnel needed to&#13;
run the organization is serious. Partly this is a problem of orientation and&#13;
experience. The civil service and professionals have little experience in the&#13;
rural areas and generally are hesitant to extend their services there. But&#13;
the main problem is personnel.&#13;

One of the most serious constraints facing the MOH is a lack of&#13;
qualified personnel. The most recent data on numbers in the health care&#13;
specialities are for 1979:&#13;
Medical practitioners&#13;
(including all specialists)                       885&#13;
Registered nurses&#13;
(including maternity assistants)                4,460&#13;
Medical assistants                              3,291&#13;
health assistants                                 402&#13;
Village health workers                            199&#13;
Only 30 to 35 physicians have been trained annually in recent years. They are&#13;
all trained in the only medical school of the country, The Godfrey Higgins&#13;
School of Mxedicine at the University. Currently, about 240 students are&#13;
enrolled in medicine; a quarter of them are Africans. Enrollment of students&#13;
entering medical school was to increase from 60 to 80 in 1981. The course for&#13;
doctors is five years after a B.Sc. degree or senior secondary education with&#13;
further credit in science subjects. The course is followed by one year of&#13;
internship.&#13;
Some 200 nurses graduate each year with a diploma in general nursing,&#13;
a three-year program offered by four schools at four central hospitals in the&#13;
country. The training is based on the block system, which alternates training&#13;
with fieldwork; the qualifying examination is arranged by the Medical and&#13;
Allied Professions Council. After the diploma in general nursing, various&#13;
specialized training programs are available -- ranging from one to three years&#13;
for specialization in midwifery, community nursing, and nursing administration.&#13;
The general education needed to enter nurse's training is senior secondary&#13;
education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
The most important paramedical cadre for the rural health program&#13;
is the medical assistant and his or her preventive counterpart, the health&#13;
assistant. The medical assistant's job is to diagnose, treat, and care for&#13;
patients in the rural areas. Medical assistants and health assistants are&#13;
trained for three years in general hospitals and mission hospitals. Most&#13;
medical assistant trainees take an additional one-year course in maternity.&#13;
There are twenty-six registered training centers for medical and health&#13;
assistants, of which thirteen are in mission hospitals. Most mission centers&#13;
were seriously damaged during the war.&#13;
Eligibility for entering the training program is completion of&#13;
Grade 10, but more advanced students apply for the program. Most candidates&#13;
applying for the program have a junior secondary (0 level) education; some&#13;
have even completed senior secondary (A level) education. The expected output&#13;
of medical and health assistants in 1980 is 180. In coming years the number&#13;
is expected to go down: some training centers were closed because of war and&#13;
a shortage of trainers.&#13;
The difference is large between the salaries of registered nurses&#13;
and medical assistants, which causes tension between the two groups. The&#13;
nurses are trained conventionally; medical assistants have both nursing and&#13;
treatment functions. Many of the medical assistants work almost independently&#13;
in rural hospitals, getting help from physicians only occasionally (physicians&#13;
normally visit twice a month and in emergencies). Medical assistants, how-&#13;
ever, receive substantially less pay than nurses, despite the fact that most&#13;
physicians consider medical assistants more helpful than nurses. Because of&#13;
their higher level of education at the entry level (recently the difference&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
has substantially narrowed), nurses have been paid more than twice what medical&#13;
assistants receive -- perhaps a legacy of the past, when most nurses were non-&#13;
Africans.&#13;
The training program for medical and health assistants will have&#13;
to be substantially extended. ]n the short run, the war damage of training&#13;
facilities is an added problem: it has reduced the output of medical and&#13;
health assistants.    A reasonable health development plan for the next five&#13;
years would include at least 450 more medical assistants and 350 more health&#13;
assistants. 1/ In addition, some medical assistants can be given refresher&#13;
training to fill some positions filled only by physicians in the past. This&#13;
will lift the morale of the medical assistants, who have had limited promotion&#13;
prospects. One criterion of selection for refresher training should be gen-&#13;
eral educational level.&#13;
The most critical health care paraprofessional to extend the rural&#13;
health program significantly is the village health worker. The 199 workers in&#13;
the country were selected by the communities they serve. Although no formal&#13;
eligibility requirement exists for general education, they are required to&#13;
be able to speak and write English fluently. This means that not all men or&#13;
women who have had the support of the community could qualify. The current&#13;
six-month training program is managed by the MOH's provincial offices. Some&#13;
provinces plan to increase the number of village health workers, but the&#13;
stipulated increase is significaiitly short of the number needed to ensure a&#13;
l.   Assuming that one health assistant will be supervising four village&#13;
health workers, that at least one medical assistant will be required&#13;
for each new rural clinic, and that four medical assistants will be&#13;
required for each new rural hospital.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
reasonable primary health care system in the country. Village health workers&#13;
will be the base of the primary health care pyramid:    their duties will include&#13;
diagnosis and treatment of simple cases, referral of patients with problems&#13;
requiring care by better trained or better equipped workers, and education&#13;
of the community in hygiene, nutrition, and personal health care. One such&#13;
primary worker can effectively serve 1,000 people (as in some states in India)&#13;
to 5,000 people (as in parts of Jamaica) depending on the situation and avail-&#13;
ability of workers. Zimbabwe will need nearly 2,000 health workers to reach&#13;
the ratio of one worker to 3,000 people served. This means a tenfold increase&#13;
in the number of village health workers, but the shortage of trainers may&#13;
prove a critical problem in achieving that level. Therefore, a crash program&#13;
of training will be needed in the short run, with provision for refresher&#13;
programs later.&#13;
Standards, coverage, and emphasis of services. Government expendi-&#13;
ture on health is not only comparatively low; a large part of the money is&#13;
spent on high standard curative medicine and hospital maintenance, mostly&#13;
in urban areas. Most of the African population in the rural areas, as noted,&#13;
remain beyond the reach of modern health care. Preventive public health&#13;
programs have been neglected, resulting in widespread incidence of many com-&#13;
municable diseases.&#13;
The coverage of the present system is limited in rural areas. It&#13;
is projected that after constructing about 200 additional clinics in the next&#13;
five years, the average area covered by a primary health care clinic will be&#13;
twenty square kilometers. In difficult terrain, this is much more than the&#13;
distance outpatients can (and will) travel to use services. As a result, only&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
those who live near a clinic have access to services. Moreover, the cultural&#13;
gap is wide between the modern health care personnel and the tradition-bound&#13;
people in tribal areas. This gap also limits the use of services. The tradi-&#13;
tional medical practitioners still provide most health care in tribal areas'.&#13;
The insensitivity of modern health workers to traditional beliefs have deterred&#13;
many people in the tribal areas from seeking and using modern-services.&#13;
Currently, too little attention is given to a diagnosis of problems&#13;
and interventions at the community level. Instead, services are mostly clinic-&#13;
based and provided to those who seek them. There is no significant effort to&#13;
involve the community so that attitudes toward health care are changed for the&#13;
better.&#13;
There now is a controversy about a likely tradeoff between quality&#13;
and coverage in the extension of the health care program. The professionals&#13;
argue that the-expansion of health care to the TTL areas should not compromise&#13;
the quality of training that medical personnel receive. Others are eager to&#13;
reduce the disparity in health services: they argue that primary health care&#13;
should be extended to remote areas as soon as possible with a crash program&#13;
of training village health workers. The controversy seems irrelevant, espe-&#13;
cially if the health needs of 95 percent of the population remain largely&#13;
unmet. But determining the best pace at which the current health care system&#13;
can be modified, adjusted, and made more responsive to the health care needs&#13;
of most Zimbabweans is an important consideration.&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT DURING 1981-85&#13;
The first priority for the health program is to repair the damaged health&#13;
facilities. The exact amount of damage is still being worked out. Roughly,&#13;
the number of rural health facilities damaged by the war are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
Number        Percentage&#13;
District hospitals                   2              10&#13;
Rural hospitals                     11              20&#13;
Mission hospitals                   48              50&#13;
Rural clinics                      168              60&#13;
The United Nations recently estimated that the total cost of repairing the&#13;
rural facilities is about Z$18 million. 1/ The MOH tentatively estimates&#13;
that immediate repairs of MOH facilities will cost Z$691,000. In addition,&#13;
Z$3,000,000 is earmarked for the repair of mission hospitals. The recon-&#13;
struction budget needed to repair council clinics (to be spent by the Dis-&#13;
trict Administration) is Z$6,181,776.&#13;
A tentative allocation of Z$1.4 million has been earmarked by the&#13;
Treasury during the current fiscal year for repair of health facilities. This&#13;
appears highly inadequate. USAID is providing Z$2 million. Other international&#13;
donors (including the World Bank) should consider providing aid to repair the&#13;
facilities. A few requirements are important, however. First, a more satis-&#13;
factory estimate of the damages must be worked out. Second, collaboration&#13;
is necessary with other international agencies interested in helping in the&#13;
reconstruction. Third, the personnel situation appears to be a bottleneck --&#13;
even to rehabilitate the damaged and closed-down hospitals. This aspect needs&#13;
careful review. Fourth, the rehabilitation program must be interwoven with a&#13;
development program. Some facilities are so run down that repairing them would&#13;
be uneconomical. Planning a new facility would be less costly.&#13;
1.   The U.N. has committed about Z$11.7 million for reconstruction; a short-&#13;
fall of more than Z$6 million still exists, according to the U.N. esti-&#13;
mate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
The highest development priority seems to be the extension of the&#13;
rural health programs. The MOR has tentatively proposed a few components of&#13;
the extension of the rural health program during the next five years:&#13;
Cost&#13;
Constructing 200 new rural clinics               Z$6,000,000&#13;
Improving old rural hospitals and&#13;
construction of new rural hospitals                6,752,000&#13;
Constructing 24 units for training&#13;
village health workers&#13;
(attached to rural hospitals)                        154,000&#13;
Strengthening preventive services                  1,356,550&#13;
Total                                         Z$14,260,550&#13;
This tentative plan is likely to be revised to give even more&#13;
emphasis on meeting health needs of the rural population. A small task&#13;
force is now working in the office of the Health Minister to revise the&#13;
plan. Although the revision of the plan is yet to be completed, a preliminary&#13;
report from the Health Minister suggests the following revisions and additions&#13;
in the plan during the next five! years:&#13;
a    52 training centers, cne in each district, are to be built to train&#13;
village health workers,. The practice of training village health&#13;
workers at the provincial headquarters will be discontinued,&#13;
and the workers will be trained near their place of work.&#13;
*    318 new rural clinics will be built.&#13;
*    33 new rural hospitals will be built.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
*    in conjunction with the Ministry of Works, a program of&#13;
constructing and protecting boreholes will be implemented&#13;
to provide safe drinking water for the rural population.&#13;
The foregoing revisions and additions will require a substantial upward revi-&#13;
sion in total cost, probably from Z$14.3 million to Z$40.1 million.&#13;
Outside agencies, such as the World Bank, should consider financing&#13;
part of the health sector development in the next five years. More important,&#13;
such agencies can help in analyzing the major issues in the sector and in&#13;
devising ways to cope with them, keeping in view the declared goals and future&#13;
directions of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4. Urban Growth and Housing&#13;
The urban housing shortage, already pressing, is likely to get worse because&#13;
of substantial increases expected in the urban African population. Until&#13;
recently, urban Africans did not own the houses in which they lived; now some&#13;
of them do. In the urban areas, six persons typically, live in a two-bedroom&#13;
dwelling. The general housing situation in tribal areas is no better. Accord-&#13;
ing to the 1969 census--the only data available--2.8 million Africans in tribal&#13;
areas occupied 440,000 dwellings with a total of 1.3 million rooms, giving an&#13;
average of more than two persons a room. Since 1969 the population in tribal&#13;
areas has grown nearly 40 percent, and it is conceivable that the housing&#13;
situation is much worse today than in 1969. In the small townships, including&#13;
district and provincial towns, Africans live in housing similar to that in&#13;
tribal areas.&#13;
Although the discussion here includes references to overall housing&#13;
condition, the focus is on the housing needs of the urban African population--&#13;
a subject that deserves special attention because of the vast influx of the&#13;
African population expected to the urban areas. The increase will be caused&#13;
in part by the disparities in income and in access to services between the&#13;
urban and tribal areas.&#13;
The situation in Zimbabwe today is similar to that in many other&#13;
East African countries at the time of independence. Zambia, Malawi, Kenya,&#13;
and Tanzania all had controls over population movement and urban settlement,&#13;
with no squatters in the urban areas at independence. By the mid-1970s each&#13;
Jeffrey Racki provided some background material for this chapter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
of these countries had urban areas in which 30 to 40 percent of the population&#13;
lived in squatter settlements. More than 80 percent of the housing developed&#13;
was leased or rented by the public sector to the occupants. This policy is&#13;
now changing rapidly; most of these units are being sold to the occupants.&#13;
SIZE AND GROWTH OF URBAN POPULATION&#13;
The location and growth of urban centers followed the pattern of investment&#13;
for infrastructural development and for industries in areas earmarked for the&#13;
Europeans. Mlore than 85 percent of the European population, compared with 20&#13;
percent of the African population, lives in cities. Although fewer than 18&#13;
percent of the urban population are Europeans, they occupy 70 percent of the&#13;
urban land. Urban growth formerly was constrained by the enforcement of&#13;
official policies regulating the movement of African migrants to the cities.&#13;
Several laws were enacted to enforce these controls, most notably the Urban&#13;
Areas Accommodation and Registration Act of 1951, which limited legal urban&#13;
residence to persons with formal employment; the Vagrancy Act of 1960, which&#13;
enabled authorities to return unemployed persons to their tribal areas; and&#13;
the Land Tenure Act of 1965, which prohibited the ownership of land by Africans&#13;
in European areas.&#13;
The 1980 estimate of the population is 7.4 million, of whom 1.5&#13;
million live in urban areas. Table 4.1 presents the trend of urban population&#13;
growth. According to the estimates, the urban African population grew about&#13;
4.7 percent a year between 1960 and 1980. Urban growth peaked between 1970&#13;
and 1975, before the escalation of the war. The urban growth in Zimbabwe is&#13;
significantly slower than in other developing countries, even than other&#13;
neighboring African countries. Between 1960 and 1980, the rate of natural&#13;

increase of the population was about 3.4 percent a year. If it is assumed&#13;
that the same rate applies to the urban African population, the urban popu-&#13;
lation growth in Zimbabwe from rural-urban migration is just over 1 percent&#13;
a year--one of the lowest among developing countries. Compare Zimbabwe's&#13;
figure of urban growth between 1960 and 1980 with those of Kenya (5.1 percent&#13;
during 1960-70), Uganda (9.2 percent during 1960-70), and Tanzania (8.6 per-&#13;
cent during 1960-70). In most developing countries rural-urban migration&#13;
alone leads to 2 to 3 percent growth--so that the urban population growth is&#13;
about twice the natural rate of population growth.&#13;
The comparatively slower urban growth in Zimbabwe is explained by&#13;
the past policies of the government. In addition, the population in cities&#13;
and towns has been grossly underestimated. In 1977 it was generally accepted&#13;
by local authorities that the urban population was at least 33 percent higher&#13;
(table 4.2) than official estimates (in table 4.1), which excluded refugees&#13;
displaced by the war and illegal migrants to the cities. Most of this un-&#13;
accounted growth--it is attributed to the relaxation of influx controls--is&#13;
thought to have occurred in the 1970s. Projecting an additional 33 percent&#13;
for all urban areas, the average growth rate from 1960 to 1980 has been around&#13;
5.4 percent a year, more in line with other developing countries. This sug-&#13;
gests that the urban population is about 2.1 million--or 28 percent of the&#13;
total population.                           I&#13;
PROFILE OF CITIES AND TOWNS&#13;
Early urban settlements in Zimbabwe tended to follow the major watersheds&#13;
of the country. This resulted in the emergence of two main axes of urban&#13;
development--one in a north-south direction between Bulawayo and Salisbury,&#13;

the other in an east-west-direction from Salisbury to Umtali, close to the&#13;
Mozambique border. Although new centers have sprung up outside these axes,&#13;
most of the investment in rail and road transport and in other infrastructure&#13;
has favored this settlement pattern.   Concurrent with the growth of these&#13;
urban areas, adjacent agricultural lands were delineated for the use of&#13;
European colonists, a process that continued until recent'ly. The Europeans&#13;
worked the more productive agricultural lands, with good access to transport,&#13;
irrigation, and other infrastructure.   Restrictions on African ownership'of&#13;
agricultural land led to overcrowding of many rural areas and to the disloca-&#13;
tion of many Africans.&#13;
Today there are forty-four urban areas.   But thirty of these have a&#13;
population of less than 10,000; together they represent less than 10 percent&#13;
of the urban population. Consequently, the analysis here is mainly focused on&#13;
fourteen urban centers. Ten of these are along the two primary axes, on the&#13;
railway lines built at the turn of the. century.&#13;
More than 70 percent of the urban population lives in Salisbury&#13;
and Bulawayo; Salisbury, with 45 percent, is the primary city. The dis-&#13;
tribution between the cities has shown little variation during the-last&#13;
decade. During 1970-75 all the major towns--except Shabani, with an-annual.&#13;
growtth rate of -1.2 percent--had fairly high growth rates. The average urban&#13;
growth rate was 5.6 percent a year. Salisbury grew at an average annual rate'&#13;
of 5.9 percent, drawing migrants from throughout the country--particularly&#13;
from Mashanoland, Manicaland, and the Midlands. Bulawayo grew 4.5 percent a&#13;
year, which in large part reflects migration from Matabeleland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
During 1975-80, war reduced urban population growth. The growth&#13;
rate of the Dopulation of Zimbabwe averaged 3.5 annually, and only four main&#13;
towns had official growth rates that were higher--Fort Victoria, Redcliff,&#13;
Sinoia, and Shabani. Salisbury's population was increasing only 1.75 per-&#13;
cent a.year,kBulawayo's 2.34 percent a year. According to these official&#13;
figures, the remaining eight Tmajor towns were losing population, which was&#13;
not the case.   The true populations (including those "unregistered" Africans)&#13;
are known in many municipalities to be from 50 to 100 percent higher than the&#13;
official counts.&#13;
The variations of population of the smaller cities--such as Fort&#13;
Victoria, hedcliff, and Sinoia--are wide because they were merely considered&#13;
as stopovers before migrants would move to larger cities by long distance bus&#13;
or by train. Migrants tended to move to the periphery of a city where they&#13;
would be less visible to authorities and less subjected to controls and evic-&#13;
tion. The average growth rate of smaller towns was more than twice the aver-&#13;
age growth rate of the fourteen main centers during 1970-80. This implies&#13;
that proportionately more people are going to the smaller towns, perhaps&#13;
because there are fewer restriictions in the movement to smaller towns or&#13;
because the smaller towns are used as first stop in to larger towns and&#13;
cities. With the removal of restrictions, more of the smaller town dwellers&#13;
may move to the main urban centers.&#13;
THE URBAN ECONOiY&#13;
Eniployment in the sectors witlh urban links has been declining since 1975&#13;
(table 4.3). Between 1975 and 1979, total employment fell nearly 30,000.&#13;
Among the declining sectors, construction, manufacturing, restaurants, and&#13;

hotels figure prominently. Government-related services and sectors--water,&#13;
health, transport, education, and electricity--did not decline much. Public&#13;
administration even increased 51 percent during that period.&#13;
During the peak of economic activity (1969-74) an average of 22,000&#13;
jobs were created annually. Since then, the number of new jobs declined,&#13;
making unemployment worse in urban areas. The Department of Manpower and&#13;
Social Affairs officially estimates that there are 60,000 urban unemployed,&#13;
half of them in Salisbury.&#13;
Table 4.3 also shows that, although the recorded urban employment&#13;
has been declining, the average earnings per worker have been steadily in-&#13;
creasing. Between 1975 and 1979 the average earnings per worker increased&#13;
50 percent. In real terms the increase was 30 percent. This increase may&#13;
reflect inflexibility in the urban wage structure; adjustments have been in&#13;
employment, not wages. The increase in real wages may have been gained by&#13;
reductions in the total urban employment.&#13;
In all fourteen major towns, population growth was substantially&#13;
faster than employment growth in the 1970s, implying a general worsening of&#13;
the employment situation in urban areas. The problem of unemployment is not&#13;
peculiar to urban areas, however. One estimate of the additional jobs needed&#13;
to eliminate the backlog for the whole country and to employ all the newcomers&#13;
to the labor market is 60-70,000 a year, requiring some Z$600 million to do&#13;
this. The GDP must grow 10-12 percent a year, which is much higher than ex-&#13;
pected. A study by the University of Zimbabwe in 1978 suggested that nearly&#13;
a third of the adult male population was unemployed. This figure must now be&#13;
higher.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
In 1978, 7 percent of the population earned more than Z$2,000 a&#13;
year, 33 percent between Z$1,000 and Z$2,000 a year, and 60 percent less than&#13;
Z$1,000 year. Only 20 percent of all wage earners earn salaries above the&#13;
poverty line. The 1979 supplement to the University of Zimbabwe urban poverty&#13;
line study suggested that the poverty line for an average family of six in&#13;
Salisbury in 1978 was $1,360 a year, or $113.45 a month. In that year 85&#13;
percent of those employed in Salisbury made less than this poverty line. The&#13;
study also gave a weighted average of monthly expenditure of $12.35 for hous-&#13;
ing, which represents only 11 percent of the total expenditure. Renters paid&#13;
a much higher proportion of their income for accommodation.&#13;
HOUSING&#13;
Initially, only single African workers and domestic servants were allowed to&#13;
live in the cities--in dormitories. Later, townships for the African urban&#13;
population were allowed, often at a considerable distance from downtown resi-&#13;
dential areas, where most Europeans lived. These townships were essentially&#13;
intended to serve as self-sufficient dormitory cities for employed Africans.&#13;
Those in search of work were strictly controlled by enforcing the 1951 legis-&#13;
lation. The townships housed the entire urban African population, other than&#13;
live-in domestic servants. Virtually all housing in the townships was con-&#13;
structed by the public sector; some was built by private industry for its&#13;
employees.&#13;
At its peak, public sector housing construction for the African&#13;
population was about 12,000 units a year, or less than half the new urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
jobs taken by African workers every year. Public sector housing authorities&#13;
experimented with different types of housing and minimized unit costs.&#13;
Certain basic standards such as running water and water-based sewerage were&#13;
strictly maintained in almost all cases.&#13;
Housing Conditions&#13;
Since there is no recent survey of housing conditions, the 1969&#13;
census figures must be used. In that year, 59 percent of the unfurnished&#13;
apartments occupied by Europeans had more than two rooms each. The African&#13;
population occupied 873,200 private units in the provinces, districts, and&#13;
main urban centers, of which 91 percent were without electricity and 56&#13;
percent were mainly traditional huts. Altogether, the African dwellings&#13;
had 2.4 million rooms. The tribal areas had 440,000 dwellings or 90 percent&#13;
of all rural dwellings, with 1.3 million rooms to be shared by 2.8 million&#13;
Africans. Although 57 percent of these dwellings had more than five persons&#13;
in a unit, only 53.5 percent had more than two rooms, giving an average of six&#13;
persons to a dwelling and two persons to a room.&#13;
In view of the disruption in the countryside caused by the war,&#13;
the bias of past policies towarcl Europeans and urban areas, the exodus of&#13;
Europeans leaving behind their real properties, and the high growth rate of&#13;
the African population, two conclusions can be drawn about the Zimbabwean&#13;
housing situation in 1980.&#13;
o    First, the housing for Europeans is improving greatly because those&#13;
who remained are practically the only ones with access to the&#13;
financial market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
e    Second, housing for the African population, especially in tribal&#13;
areas, is deteriorating--and overcrowding is expected to get worse.--&#13;
Attempts at squatting on vacant urban land by families without other housing&#13;
alternatives previously was prevented by the local authorities. Consequently,&#13;
the only source of supply was that in townships. By 1977 about 1,074,000&#13;
people were living in 130,000 low-income units--approximately 65 percent more&#13;
than the units were designed for.&#13;
With the easing of influx restrictions in 1977, squatter settlements&#13;
once again appeared and again most were cleared. Nonetheless, by 1978 Red&#13;
Cross International estimated that some 50,000 squatters (including war&#13;
refugees) were scattered around the urban areas. 1/ In Derbyshire, on the&#13;
outskirts of Salisbury, the squatters were relocated to a "transit" area&#13;
just outside the Salisbury municipal boundary that abuts Seki New Town,&#13;
an African township being developed by the Ministry of Local Government and&#13;
Housing. Because they were established as a temporary solution, the transit&#13;
areas had standards much lower than previous public shelter programs including&#13;
smaller plots and communal water and sewerage services. There is little&#13;
indication that transit housing will be replaced, however, and secure tenure&#13;
has not been provided. Table 4.4 shows that only a few residents owned their&#13;
houses in 1978.&#13;
1/   The Housing Development Services of the Ministry of Local Government&#13;
and Housing stated in its October 1980 study, "Urban Development in&#13;
Zimbabwe," that there were 35,000 squatters in all urban areas in 1980.&#13;

Housing Needs&#13;
Some projections of the growth of urban population can help in&#13;
roughly estimating the number of housing units needed to cope with growth.&#13;
The urban population grew 7 percent a year before the war broke out; even&#13;
this is on the low side. I assume 10 percent growth in the urban population&#13;
for 1980-85, and 7 percent (approximately twice the natural population growth&#13;
rate) for the period 1986-1990. These rates probably are on the conservative&#13;
side for the several reasons:&#13;
*    Many urban migrants (legal and illegal)have not yet brought&#13;
their families to the cities. In the past, there often were&#13;
restrictions for migrants to bring families. After the&#13;
restrictions were removed, many brought their families and&#13;
others are likely to do 50 in future.&#13;
*    Growth rates of urban population were more than 6.7 percent a&#13;
year over the last decade, exceptionally high even if actual&#13;
population estimates are used.&#13;
e    Overcrowding of rural land--a result of past land settlement&#13;
practices and of dislocations during the war years--will exert&#13;
pressure on rural residents, at least in the short term. The&#13;
government plans a vigorous policy of rural development and&#13;
resettlement, but this will take time.&#13;
&#149;    The government has recently decided to settle near urban&#13;
areas some of the armed groups who fought for independence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
a    The gap between urban and rural incomes and the perceived&#13;
opportunities and attractions of the urban areas will encourage&#13;
migration--at least in the short run.&#13;
o    The recent shift in emphasis from renting to home-ownership in&#13;
public sector housing development and the security of tenure&#13;
now available in urban areas will tend to attract families and&#13;
relatives of those already living in cities.&#13;
o    The high rate of natural population growth (3.5 percent) will&#13;
increase the pressure in (and push from) rural areas.&#13;
*    The 1980 base-year population also will include the refugees&#13;
in urban areas.&#13;
The Ministry of Finance projects an annual increase of 11.5 percent, at least&#13;
through 1983--a rate similar to that which occurred briefly in Botswana and&#13;
Malawi. 1/ The analysis here uses a 10-percent sustained growth rate for the&#13;
next five years, which is slightly higher than those in Uganda, Kenya, and&#13;
Lesotho. I use this rate because our base-year estimate already includes&#13;
unreported cases. After 1985, I assume a 7 percent annual growth of urban&#13;
population, twice the natural growth&amp;rate of 3.5 percent and similar to the&#13;
experience of many developing countries in Africa and Asia.&#13;
Table 4.5 projects the population of the fourteen urban centers.&#13;
The table shows that the urban population will double in the next eight years.&#13;
A difficulty in estimating this growth is determining what the 1980 base&#13;

Assumptions for 1980:&#13;
1.   Salisbury, Bulawayo, Gwelo, Umtali, Que Que, Gatooma and Fort&#13;
Victoria to have the same percentage of excess over population as&#13;
shown in Table 2 for 1977.&#13;

estimates of their African populations.&#13;

population should be--1.5 milllon as officially projected or roughly 2 mil-&#13;
lion, which is believed to be the correct figure for the total urban popula-&#13;
tion. In this report I estimate the current urban population as 2.1 million.&#13;
Although there will be some movement of refugees back to the rural areas, I do&#13;
not expect any reduction in the number because the return will be matched by&#13;
an influx of refugees into urban areas.&#13;
With this estimate, Zimbabwe can anticipate an average annual in-&#13;
crease in urban population of 258,000 during 1981-85. This translates to&#13;
between 43,100 and 51,700 new ,amilies a year. After 1985, despite the fall-&#13;
ing growth in absolute terms, the population will increase by about 274,400&#13;
people each year--or by between 45,700 and 54,900 families. In the next ten&#13;
years, then, the urban population will have increased 126 percent and will&#13;
comprise about 45 percent of the population.&#13;
housing Supply&#13;
Growth in the output of low-income housing has shown a steady increase&#13;
over the last decade, reaching annual production levels of between 11,000 and&#13;
12,000 units in the last three to five years. The enormous gap between the&#13;
preindependence supply of urban housing and the growth in demand, despite&#13;
influx controls, is evident from the backlog of about 44,000 qualified appli-&#13;
cants on the waiting list for housing in all municipalities. The projected&#13;
accelerated growth rates for the next three to five years indicate even&#13;
greater pressure for increases in supply. The Finance Ministry's report 1/&#13;
concludes that these large shortfalls are not the result of limitations in&#13;
1/   Urban Development in the Main Centers, 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

implementation capacity, particularly with reference to the construction&#13;
industry. The Central Statistical Office states that the civil engineering&#13;
and construction work done by both the private and public sectors fell from a&#13;
peak of Z$227 million in 1975 to Z$168 million in 1977--a fall of 26 percent.&#13;
The slack in the industry could be taken up by the construction of additional&#13;
low-cost housing. But the report concludes that lack of financing for low-&#13;
income housing is primarily responsible for the growing gap between housing&#13;
supply and need.&#13;
During the last four or five years, private developers have been&#13;
providing housing in the range of Z$4,000 to Z$5,000 or more. This is mid-&#13;
dle-income, housing not low-income. But the effort is a resource that, if&#13;
properly mobilized and integrated into an overall housing program, could&#13;
release additional public resources for lower cost housing.&#13;
ISSUES IN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT&#13;
Level of Expenditure&#13;
Although a share of total fixed capital formation of 20 to 30 per-&#13;
cent is appropriate for housing in a rapidly growing country with a vigorous&#13;
housing policy, the share in Zimbabwe has never been more than 16 percent.&#13;
Recently it has been only a little over 11 percent. Of this, less than 30&#13;
percent was low-income housing (3.2 percent of the total gross fixed capital&#13;
formation). Because the demand for housing is greatest in the low-income&#13;
sector and because housing requirements for the high-and-middle-income sectors&#13;
are generally met, the major shortfalls in gross fixed capital formation are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
in the low-income sector. Housing accounts for a steadily increasing propor-&#13;
tion of the government's total capital budget. If the amount of low-income&#13;
housing fixed capital formation is to be raised substantially from its present&#13;
low level, this proportion would obviously exceed the capacity of local author-&#13;
ities. Some form of financial support is needed from alternative sources.&#13;
Housing development in Zimbabwe should be linked with the devel-&#13;
opment strategy, which must first address the problem of income disparity,&#13;
particularly the income of the Africans living in tribal areas. Housing&#13;
development cannot be solely confined to urban areas.&#13;
The Integrated Plan for Rural Development (July 1978) and the pro-&#13;
posals for a Five-year Program of Development in the Public Sector (January&#13;
1979) discuss the need for more rural development. Included is a program for&#13;
coordinating rural development strategies with the creation of about twenty-&#13;
five urban centers in the tribal areas. This would introduce urban services&#13;
and infrastructure to these lagging regions and provide alternatives to would-&#13;
be migrants to the cities. But because the cost of setting up these new&#13;
centers is high, the cost and benefit of the new centers must be carefully&#13;
weighed.&#13;
The reality of pressure on urban housing is such that the problem&#13;
cannot be assigned low priority. An integrated plan with emphasis on rural&#13;
areas is needed, a plan that includes creation of growth centers in tribal&#13;
areas and a program to ease the pressure on urban housing. The latter might&#13;
be accomplished by increasingly drawing on other sources of financing for&#13;
urban housing. The problem of housing for the African population in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
urban areas is now serious. Considering the likely growth of urban popu-&#13;
lation, the problem will become more serious, as the projections indicate.&#13;
Government policies should aim at checking migration to urban centers by&#13;
initiating substantial programs of rural development. At the same time, the&#13;
government should prepare to meet housing needs of the urban population.&#13;
With the ban on urban migration lifted, the higher living standards of the&#13;
urban population, Africans included, will only attract more migrants.&#13;
housing Types, Standards, and Costs&#13;
Although the range of low-income housing projects in Zimbabwe is&#13;
fairly diverse, these can be classified in four main types: standard low-&#13;
income housing, core housing, transitional (ultralow-cost) housing, and&#13;
sites and services.&#13;
Standard housing generally takes the form of detached or semi-&#13;
detached single-story units (more than 85 percent of all standard units&#13;
built). But some one- and two-story terraced housing units have been built,&#13;
as have some apartments of varying height. The detached and semidetached&#13;
units include one to three bedrooms, a living-dining room, internal or ex-&#13;
ternal combined flush toilet and shower, and a kitchen (often in the form of&#13;
a partially sheltered cooking area). The size of units ranges from 30 to 60&#13;
square meters. Core housing was introduced in the early 1960s and is being&#13;
constructed in larger numbers today. They usually have one or two rooms (of&#13;
nine square meters), plus shower and toilet facilities. For ultralow-cost&#13;
housing, the most recent units were built from standard cement, reinforced&#13;
with chicken wire mesh; they featured an asbestos roof and a rammed-earth&#13;
floor. At this time, only the Housing Development Services Branch of the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government and Housing has built these units. Sites and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
services, recently introduced in a housing program of 8,000 sites in Salisbury,&#13;
include a plot of land with demarcated stands for construction and an enclosed&#13;
cubicle containing shower and toilet facilities. The owner is required to&#13;
build a permanent structure within ten years of occupancy and may in the&#13;
interim construct a temporary structure. One persuasive criticism of the&#13;
program is that without minimum shelter and facilities, the owner is compelled&#13;
to rent separate living space while building. This creates hardship for the&#13;
prospective occupants and delays in the construction of the houses. Generally,&#13;
the sites are plots of either 200 square meters or 315 square meters; the most&#13;
common is 200 square meters. Current infrastructure standards require indi-&#13;
vidual water supply, water-based sewerage, and street access to each plot.&#13;
Electricity networks allowing optional individual connections are sometimes&#13;
included, and street lighting is provided.&#13;
Based on the prevailing standards of construction and service levels,&#13;
table 4.6 summarizes cost estimates for the four main housing options provided&#13;
by the public sector. The examples costed out under each option in the table&#13;
are typical of the average sizes and standards in shelter projects in cities.&#13;
The total cost for each option will therefore be used as the basis for eval-&#13;
uating affordability by the urban population. Total cost will also establish&#13;
the financial implications of a shelter program designed to satisfy the pro-&#13;
jected growth in demand in cities.&#13;
Financing a Housing Program&#13;
The sources of financing are different for the two kinds of agency&#13;
in housing development--public and private. Public agencies include the&#13;
central government and the local government bodies; private agents include&#13;

private homeowners and employers who build houses for the employees). The&#13;
major sources of financing fcr the two categories are:     the African Building&#13;
Fund, municipal services levy funds, local authority beer funds, treasury&#13;
loans, building society loans, stock issues, and private sources.&#13;
The African Building Fund, the major single source of financing, is&#13;
administered by the Ministry of Local Government and Housing. It lends money&#13;
to local authorities (other than the Salisbury and Bulawayo municipalities)&#13;
for housing, essential services, and other buildings. The fund consists of&#13;
money appropriated by the legislature; money received from rents, interest, or&#13;
the realization of any propetty; and--with the approval of the Minister of&#13;
Finance--borrowings from other institutions, such as building societies and&#13;
insurance companies. The fund is not profitmaking: it seeks only to recoup&#13;
such interest and capital repayments as it has to pay on its borrowings. The&#13;
cost of administering the fund is met by the government and not by the fund.&#13;
Another source of finance is the services levy. The Services Levy&#13;
Act provides for compulsory contributions by specific employers toward the&#13;
construction of low-income hcousing and the provision of services. In addi-&#13;
tion, all local authorities administering low-income housing areas have&#13;
established African beer undertakings. Under the regulations of the African&#13;
Beer Act, local authorities can contribute up to 50 percent of the annual&#13;
profits derived from their African beer undertakings and outlets to a revolving&#13;
fund for housing.&#13;
In the private sect:or, building societies have played a limited&#13;
role in financing low-income housing, primarily because their minimum building&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
standards criteria result in structures costing Z$5,000 to Z$6,000. Rates of&#13;
interest paid on deposits and charged on loans are set by the government. Con-&#13;
sequently, in the absence of a free market for financing houses, any matching&#13;
of demand and supply occurs only by chance. In addition, the minimum liquidity&#13;
ratio currently is 20 percent, keeping millions of additional dollars away&#13;
from the housing market. Given the controlled interest rates, the building&#13;
societies attract a limited number of deposits, usually from lower income&#13;
groups without many alternatives. With the minimum building standards cri-&#13;
teria, the tendency has been for the societies to transfer funds from many&#13;
poor savers to a few relatively rich borrowers. Although building societies&#13;
do not generally make loans to individuals for the purchase of low-income&#13;
houses that do not comply with their building specifications, they do provide&#13;
block loans to government and municipalities for the development of low-income&#13;
housing estates.&#13;
In the late 1970s, private developers became involved in developing&#13;
housing units costing $4,000 to $6,000. By 1980 they had about 220 units&#13;
under construction or completed, with 320 units projected as a second phase.&#13;
Employers have been required in part to provide housing assistance,&#13;
either by paying rent supplements directly to employees or by making free&#13;
or subsidized housing available to employees. Current policies require full&#13;
cost recovery from the beneficiaries for all shelter projects developed by&#13;
employers. Some capital costs now are recovered through amortization pay-&#13;
ments; others, through specific monthly charges. In addition, there are&#13;
monthly supplementary charges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -&#13;
HOUSING SECTOR DEVELOPMENT DURING 1981-85&#13;
The overall strategies of housing and urban development, including new urban&#13;
centers, are still being worked out. There is, however, a plan for urban&#13;
housing for the next five years, stipulating an expenditure of Z$773 million&#13;
to build 167,000 housing units. Based on the available data and the plan, a&#13;
reasonable urban hcusing program can be anticipated.&#13;
A program designed to satisfy the effective demand for urban hous-&#13;
ing must consider the number c,f urban income earners that can afford various&#13;
types of houses. The number in each category will depend on the distribu-&#13;
tion of urban income. But to cover as many potential dwellers as possible,&#13;
the construction of types of units will be weighted in favor of less expensive&#13;
options. The distribution of wage income indicates that only 3 percent of the&#13;
population can afford private market housing. If it is assumed that the same&#13;
proportion (97 percent) will be applied against the projected increases in&#13;
the urban population in determining the need for public sector shelter, about&#13;
250,700 new urban households (with an average of five persons per household)&#13;
will be added between 1980 and, 1985 to the backlog of 44,000 of applicants for&#13;
houses in 1980--to give a total of 294,700 houses needed. Based on preliminary&#13;
estimates, 15 percent of them could afford option A; 25 percent, option B; 60&#13;
percent, option C. In deciding these proportions about affordability, it has&#13;
been assumed that the 15 percent of households buying option A will be charged&#13;
20 percent more than the full average cost. 1/ The price for option B will&#13;
1/   This is arbitrarily assumed on the basis of observed strong demand for&#13;
such public houses. These public housing units are priced much lower&#13;
than comparable units in the private housing market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
reflect the average full cost of constructing the units. Option C will be&#13;
subsidized to the extent possible by profits generated by selling option A.&#13;
Two advantages of this internal system of subsidy financing can&#13;
be cited. First, more of the low-income group can be covered by subsidized&#13;
pricing; without subsidy, a substantial percentage of the low-income earners&#13;
will not be able to buy even the lowest cost option. Second, by making more&#13;
houses of option A, whose private market prices would be still higher than&#13;
the public housing plan, the low-cost housing market would be relieved of&#13;
considerable pressure from middle-income Africans.&#13;
In working out the phasing of the development program, present pro-&#13;
duction levels of 12,000 to 15,000 units and excess capacity in the construc-&#13;
tion sector were considered (table 4.7). To the total cost of $598 million&#13;
in 1980 prices must be added the costs of off-site "bulk" infrastructure ser-&#13;
vices. Requirements for off-site facilities vary from site to site. The&#13;
range appears to be between Z$200 and Z$500 a plot, including electrification.&#13;
To estimate the capital expenditure required for the housing program, an aver-&#13;
age cost of $350 a plot was used. That represents an additional project cost&#13;
of $103.1 million--bringing total costs to $701.2 million in 1980 prices, or&#13;
$137.5 million more than the estimates of $563.7 million proposed by the&#13;
Housing Development Services Branch of the Ministry of Local Government and&#13;
Housing. If prices increase 15 percent in years two and three and 12 percent&#13;
in years four and five, the cost of the five-year housing program will come&#13;
to Z$808.6 million.&#13;

Other costs to be included in a housing program are credit facili-&#13;
ties for building materials loans. In 1980 prices, these are estimated at&#13;
$1,000 a plot for option A, $1,200 a plot for option B, and $1,400 a plot&#13;
for option C. Another component proposed is the electrification of about&#13;
100,000 existing units to offset the high cost of fuel and the reduced avail-&#13;
ability of firewood. At $300 a house, this is projected to cost $6,000,000&#13;
a year. The annual expenditure required for 1981-85 is summarized in table&#13;
4.8.&#13;
The investment requirement of the urban housing sector is substan-&#13;
tial; but it should be noted that, investment in housing, unlike that in&#13;
health, is recovered from the beneficiaries. In Zimbabwe, a general strategy&#13;
of development must first address the problem of disparity in level of living.&#13;
In that strategy, housing development cannot be solely confined to urban areas.&#13;
But the current pressure on urban housing is such that the problem cannot be&#13;
assigned a low priority. An integrated development plan with emphasis on&#13;
rural areas is needed, one that would also include a program to ease the&#13;
pressure on urban housing.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Black majority government of
            Zimbabwe, coming to power after a long struggle for
            independence, has announced its strong commitment to social
            services to benefit the vast majority of the population. In
            education, two ethnically separate systems will have to be
            effectively amalgamated, and more basic educational programs
            for the tribal lands population will have to be designed.
            This calls for a dramatic increase in the number of
            qualified teachers, possible only through a crash training
            program. In health, there has to be significant extension of
            services in tribal areas within the framework of a primary
            health care system. In housing, low-cost shelter programs in
            the urban areas should be closely linked with rural
            development strategies to create new urban centers in tribal
            areas. This paper looks at these issues and outlines the
            prospects. Specific plans and resource requirements are also reviewed.
