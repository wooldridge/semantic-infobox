a. Bank lending amounts in fiscal 1998 and 1999 are presented together, the two years being exceptional due to the East Asian financial crisis.&#13;
b. Due to a recoding of one project there is a discrepancy between these figures and the figures in the 2002 annual report (table 2.2). This discrepancy&#13;
of 2.2 million shows up in the commitment amounts in fiscal 2002 for Social Protection and Risk Management and Rural Development (with the two&#13;
themes showing 2.2 million higher and 2.2 million lower, respectively).&#13;

Investing in People&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The challenge of reducing global poverty and improv-&#13;
ing the human welfare of millions of poor people&#13;
could scarcely be more powerful. In 2002 almost&#13;
11 million children died before their fifth birthday.&#13;
Most of these deaths occurred in developing countries,&#13;
with 4.5 million in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, and&#13;
many others in South Asia. Maternal mortality is&#13;
20 times higher among the poorest quarter of the&#13;
world's population than among the richest quarter.&#13;
In 2002, 3.1 million people died from HIV/AIDS. Life&#13;
expectancy has fallen by as much as 20 years in those&#13;
countries with the highest infection rates, and hard-&#13;
won improvements in child mortality have been&#13;
reversed. Some 115 million primary-school-age&#13;
children in developing countries do not go to school;&#13;
64 million of them are girls.&#13;
   The World Bank stands by its commitment to scale&#13;
up efforts to help countries achieve universal primary&#13;
education, combat communicable diseases, reduce&#13;
child mortality, improve maternal health, and protect&#13;
vulnerable populations from crisis.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Toward Environmentally and Socially&#13;
Responsible Growth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
During fiscal 2003 the World Bank has been advocating&#13;
for the vision of responsible growth that was put forth&#13;
in the World Development Report 2003 and affirmed at&#13;
the World Summit on Sustainable Development&#13;
(WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa, in August&#13;
2002.&#13;
   At the summit a consensus emerged on moving&#13;
toward a new development path that will combine&#13;
growth with environmental responsibility and social&#13;
equity, in both rich and poor countries. Poverty&#13;
reduction is much more than a development aid&#13;
issue--it is also an issue of global stability, the&#13;
summit emphasized.&#13;
   One key message emerging from Johannesburg and&#13;
the Bank's own operational experience is clear: enlight-&#13;
ened public policy, a responsible and accountable pri-&#13;
vate sector, and proactive civil society organizations&#13;
are needed to achieve the WSSD targets and the Mil-        The world community is making renewed commitments to urgently need-&#13;

spirit of cooperation and of constructive engagement&#13;

The World Bank's Private Sector Development and&#13;
Infrastructure Networks promote private initiatives&#13;
for poverty reduction and support infrastructure&#13;
development in poor countries. Two separate vice&#13;
presidencies were created from the former Private&#13;
Sector Development and Infrastructure Vice&#13;
Presidency in fiscal 2003. The Infrastructure Vice&#13;
Presidency, which now consolidates the Bank's infra-&#13;
structure departments and infrastructure-related&#13;
global programs, commenced operations as a&#13;
separate network in May 2003. So also did the new&#13;
Private Sector Development Vice Presidency, which is&#13;

     Building Strong Financial Systems&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The World Bank has long recognized that poverty&#13;
     reduction and economic growth depend on effective&#13;
     and strong national financial systems. Financial sys-&#13;
     tems that develop unevenly and lack transparency and&#13;
     proper regulation are more vulnerable to financial&#13;
     shocks and prone to distress. Extensive Bank research&#13;
     has proven that these shocks and crises disproportion-&#13;
     ately affect poor people. Weak financial systems in&#13;
     developing countries also exacerbate poverty levels by&#13;
     providing inadequate access to capital and financial&#13;
     services to individuals and to small and medium enter-&#13;
     prises, which are key to economic growth. The Bank&#13;
     contributes to these financial sector priorities in three&#13;
     ways: knowledge dissemination, lending and technical&#13;
     assistance, and partnerships.&#13;

intensified its work in this area, establishing a strong,&#13;

12 regions. More than half of the country technical&#13;
assistance projects involved advice or assistance in&#13;

DEVELOPING HUMAN RESOURCES&#13;
&#13;
Developing human capital is key to reducing poverty&#13;
through better access to education and health services&#13;
and through social protection interventions to help&#13;
vulnerable groups. In fiscal 2003 over 21 percent&#13;
($811 million) of the Bank's commitments in Africa&#13;
were for human development. Communicable dis-&#13;
eases, notably HIV/AIDS, pose critical challenges for&#13;
Africa's development. The Bank has approved $1 bil-&#13;
lion over time to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa and remains&#13;
the region's leading financier of HIV/AIDS programs.&#13;
Through the Multicountry HIV/AIDS Program for&#13;
Africa, $600 million has been committed by 20 coun-&#13;
tries. This program has approved 18 projects, of which&#13;
15 are already effective. Other health, nutrition, and&#13;
population programs involved 47 projects in 30 coun-&#13;
tries. (See box 5.1.)&#13;
   The Bank is actively involved in 41 education&#13;
projects in the region, particularly focusing on pri-&#13;
mary education and on countries with low enroll-&#13;

    The Bank addresses governance issues through&#13;
supporting programs that decentralize government&#13;
and build government capacity; at the same time, the&#13;
Bank supports programs emphasizing public sector&#13;
transparency and greater stakeholder participation. It&#13;
is currently studying e-government initiatives to assess&#13;
the role those initiatives might play in decreasing&#13;
corruption through greater transparency and enabling&#13;
greater citizen interaction with government. Two&#13;

government capacity in a number of areas: manage-&#13;

corruption initiatives and reforms in the civil service&#13;
and in the legal and judicial sectors.&#13;

EMPOWERING POOR PEOPLE&#13;

The Bank focuses on policies and institutions that&#13;
help households manage social risks, build an effective&#13;
social policy framework, and enable poor people to&#13;
participate in the benefits of growth. A key point of&#13;
its strategy in low-income countries is assisting the&#13;
government in developing a Poverty Reduction&#13;

     The Bank's East Asia and Pacific region is focusing&#13;

&#13;
     Improving the Environment&#13;
     The Bank integrates environmental components into&#13;
     much of its lending in rural, urban, water, and energy&#13;
     sectors. Furthermore, the Bank has forestry manage-&#13;
     ment programs under way in Cambodia, China,&#13;
     Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, and&#13;
     provides policy advice to Indonesia. The Bank is&#13;
     assisting China's water management goals, including&#13;
     lending for flood prevention, irrigation system devel-&#13;
     opment, comprehensive river basin management,&#13;

expand water and sanitation service to poor people.&#13;
These approaches include a $50 million project to&#13;
expand water service to 1.3 million people in rural&#13;
Peru, as well as financing to rehabilitate water sup-&#13;
ply and sanitation networks and wells, promote&#13;
water conservation, and improve efficiency and&#13;
service at Lima's public water utility. The project also&#13;
expanded service to 600,000 previously unserved&#13;
slum dwellers.&#13;

GLOBAL PRIORITIES&#13;
&#13;
The Middle East and North Africa region focused ac-&#13;
tivities on the following global priorities during this&#13;
fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Maternal and Child Health&#13;
With children and youth constituting more than half&#13;
of the population in the Middle East and North Africa&#13;
region, they are among the most vulnerable segments&#13;
of society during times of economic stress and political&#13;
conflict. In coordination with the United Nations&#13;
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other partners, the&#13;
Bank is conducting situation analyses and supporting&#13;
community-based projects to deliver services for&#13;
                                                               A Yemeni farmer working on irrigation channels in his farm along the&#13;
children. In Jordan the Bank is supporting a mentoring         Sana'a-Taiz highway. Poverty in Yemen is a predominantly rural phenome-&#13;
&#13;
program to help at-risk children integrate into their          non, posing a critical challenge for overcoming the urban-rural gap.&#13;

a. World Bank Atlas methodology; per capita GNI (gross national income, formerly GNP) figures are in 2002 U.S. dollars.&#13;
b. Countries are eligible for IDA on the basis of (a) relative poverty and (b) lack of creditworthiness. The operational cutoff for IDA eligibility for fiscal 2004 is a&#13;
2002 GNI per capita of $865, using Atlas methodology. To receive IDA resources, countries must also meet tests of performance. In exceptional circumstances, IDA&#13;
extends eligibility temporarily to countries that are above the operational cutoff and are undertaking major adjustment efforts but are not creditworthy for IBRD&#13;
lending. An exception has been made for small island economies (see footnote c).&#13;
c. An exception to the GNI per capita operational cutoff for IDA eligibility ($865 for fiscal 2004) has been made for some small island economies, which&#13;
otherwise would have little or no access to Bank Group assistance because they lack creditworthiness. For such countries IDA funding is considered case by case&#13;
for the financing of projects and adjustment programs designed to strengthen creditworthiness.&#13;

Development Association and they pay their contributions in freely convertible currency. Part II countries may be donors and are entitled to pay most of&#13;
their contributions in local currency. For more information, and for Statement of Voting Power, and Subscriptions and Contributions of IDA Members,&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The World Bank Annual Report for 2003,
            reviews the strategy and action pursued by the Bank, based
            on the Strategic Framework, and Strategic Directions (and
            Management Action Plan), focused on meeting the development
            challenges embodied in the Millennium Development Goals
            (MDGs). To this end, the Bank sharpened its policies,
            programs, and instruments to support its central mission of
            reducing poverty, through improved performance monitoring,
            and management, and improved harmonization of operational
            policies, procedures, and practices among donors. The Bank
            also considered other issues, such as its role in the
            reconstruction of Iraq, the introduction of the grants
            component in the 13th Replenishment of the International
            Development Association (IDA), the Operation Evaluation
            Department's (OED) review of the Heavily Indebted Poor
            Countries (HIPC) Initiative, and, market access for exports
            from developing countries. Methods for combating terrorism,
            and money laundering were also considered during the period
            under review. The document presents thematic (and regional)
            perspectives based on two pillars - poverty reduction and
            economic management - and how to invest in people, towards
            an environmentally, and socially responsible growth, that
            supports private sector development, infrastructure
            development, financial management, and, promotes appropriate
            legal and judicial systems. The second Volume presents the
            financial statements for the period July 1, 2002 to June 30,
            2003, reporting development activities (loans, guarantees,
            and other activities), including liquidity management,
            funding resources, and financial risk management.
