THE ART OF&#13;
KNOWLEDGE&#13;
EXCHANGE&#13;
A Results-Focused Planning Guide For&#13;
Development Practitioners&#13;
&amp;#12;The only&#13;
source of&#13;
knowledge is&#13;
experience&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Why&#13;
Knowledge&#13;
Exchange?&#13;
Knowledge exchange, or peer-to-peer learning, is an important way to&#13;
share, replicate, and scale up what works in development. Develop-&#13;
ment practitioners want to learn from the practical experience of others&#13;
who have gone through, or are going through, similar problems. They&#13;
want to be connected to each other and have ready access to knowl-&#13;
edge and solutions.&#13;
&#13;
In todayâ&#128;&#153;s multi-polar world, development experience and knowledge is&#13;
flowing in every direction: from South to South, East to West, and South&#13;
to North. Harnessing and then transferring this knowledge and devel-&#13;
opment experience lies at the core of effective knowledge exchange.&#13;
&#13;
Effective knowledge exchange does three things:&#13;
QQ Connects and convenes practitioners and/or key stakeholders&#13;
   around shared development challenges&#13;
QQ Facilitates timely and systematic sharing of knowledge in the form&#13;
   of good practices, lessons learned, and insights&#13;
QQ Catalyzes results&#13;
&amp;#12;THE WORLD&#13;
BANK &amp;&#13;
KNOWLEDGE:&#13;
Connecting Globally, Enabling Locally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s role as a knowledge institution has evolved to include&#13;
three distinct functionsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
QQ Producing and disseminating high-quality global and country&#13;
   knowledge&#13;
QQ Working with clients to customize policies and programs to meet&#13;
   specific challenges based on the best available knowledge&#13;
QQ Connecting governments, civil society, and private actors with oth-&#13;
   ers that have faced similar challenges&#13;
&#13;
Because of its scale and diversity, the World Bank can play any or&#13;
all of these roles as needed to address development challenges:&#13;
&#13;
Knowledge producer. Knowledge is produced all across the World&#13;
Bank. One example is the Development Economics Unit, which pro-&#13;
vides intellectual leadership and analytical services to the Bank and the&#13;
development community.&#13;
&#13;
Knowledge customizer. World Bank task teams and country offices&#13;
interact directly with clients organizing and applying knowledge from&#13;
a wide range of sources to help countries address their development&#13;
challenges.&#13;
&amp;#12;Knowledge connector. The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s engagement through glob-&#13;
al partnerships and facilitation of South-South exchanges highlights&#13;
its role as connector. Operational units perform this role as a part of&#13;
their client services, while the World Bank Institute (WBI) focuses mainly&#13;
on this role. WBI facilitates regional and global knowledge exchange&#13;
by linking country practitioners and policy makers to sources and&#13;
centers of cutting-edge knowledge and innovation across the world.&#13;
&#13;
In its role as a facilitator of regional and global knowledge exchange,&#13;
WBI is also developing a range of knowledge products and services.&#13;
This planning guide focuses on the â&#128;&#156;how toâ&#128;&#157; of knowledge exchange,&#13;
in order to help development practitioners, policy makers, and academ-&#13;
ics plan, implement, and get results out of their knowledge exchange&#13;
initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Planning Guide â&#128;&#147; Whatâ&#128;&#153;s Inside?&#13;
Designing and implementing knowledge exchange initiatives can be a&#13;
big undertaking. This guide takes the guesswork out of the process by&#13;
breaking it down into simple steps and providing tools to help you play&#13;
a more effective role as knowledge connector and learning facilitator.&#13;
&#13;
It will help you:&#13;
QQ Identify &amp; Assess capacity development needs&#13;
&#13;
QQ Design &amp; Develop an appropriate knowledge exchange initiative&#13;
   that responds to those needs&#13;
&#13;

Got Milk? How Tanzania Learned&#13;
from Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#152;White Revolutionâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	Examples from the&#13;
                               1&#13;
                                Although Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s child mortality rate has been falling steadily in recent decades,&#13;
                               it remains 77 percent above the world average, at 108 deaths per 1,000 children. In&#13;
     Tanzanian Story are       order to address this problem, the Tanzanian government sought to improve nutrition&#13;
     used throughout this      and incomes in rural areas by restructuring its agriculture sector, particularly the&#13;
     toolkit to show you       struggling dairy industry.&#13;
     how to write each step    Tanzania wanted to follow the best model and learn how India carried out its&#13;
     of your Knowledge         renowned â&#128;&#156;white revolution,â&#128;&#157; during which it increased its milk production by a factor&#13;
                               of five to become the worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest single milk producer.&#13;
     Exchange design. While&#13;
     based on a true case,     Last year, the World Bank funded a Knowledge Exchange between the two nations,&#13;
                               aimed at improving the performance of Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s dairy sector by promoting&#13;
     The Tanzanian Story&#13;
                               favorable policies, incentives and efficient dairy supply chains, as well as improving&#13;
     as represented herein     the operational efficiency of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) and the&#13;
     has been modified for     Ministry of Agriculture (MoA).&#13;
     the purpose of learning   The initiative involved a number of Knowledge Exchange Instruments and activities&#13;
     and should not be         and was highly successful. A working group from Tanzania and India met in a series of&#13;
     considered factual.       videoconferences to plan the exchange, which was anchored by a 10-day expert visit&#13;
                               to Tanzania by six officials from the Indian National Development Dairy Board and the&#13;
                               Gujarat Federation. Then a small delegation of 14 Tanzanian officials, chosen from the&#13;
                               MoA, NDDB, dairy producers, processors, and distributors, visited India on a study&#13;
                               tour to see first-hand how India had transformed its dairy industry. The exchange&#13;
                               participants held a follow-up videoconference and developed a brochure and videos&#13;
                               summarizing the lessons learned.&#13;
                               The outcomes included:&#13;
                                    â&#128;¢	   Enhanced knowledge and skills&#13;
                                    â&#128;¢	   Improved consensus and teamwork&#13;
                                    â&#128;¢	   New implementation know-how&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               Using their new insights, Tanzanian dairy officials have not only developed policies&#13;
                               based on the Indian model, they have also successfully implemented dairy reforms&#13;
                               and built consensus among stakeholder groups for a blueprint of further reforms. The&#13;
                               NDDB has implemented the rapid results approach learnt from India to scale up the&#13;
                               reforms across the country.&#13;
                               Even though Tanzania may not see its milk production quintuple in the near future,&#13;
                               it has started to make progress in revamping and improving its agriculture sector.&#13;
                               Boosting nutrition and incomes in rural areas cannot be far behind.&#13;

Anchor the&#13;
Knowledge&#13;
Exchange&#13;
Knowledge exchange can be used as part of a change process to pow-&#13;
erful effect. But like any good capacity building approach, it should be&#13;
anchored in the broader development context and your clientsâ&#128;&#153; needs&#13;
should drive the agenda. Before committing to a full-fledged knowl-&#13;
edge exchange initiative, ask yourself these questions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
QQ What is the development goal and how will this initiative contribute&#13;
   towards its achievement?&#13;
QQ What are the major constraints limiting your clientsâ&#128;&#153; achievement of&#13;
   this goal?&#13;
QQ What will change as a result of this knowledge exchange? How is&#13;
   this change going to happen?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
    Anchor the&#13;
    Knowledge&#13;
    Exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    1.1. Identify the Development Goal (and How to&#13;
    Achieve It)&#13;
    The Development Goal focuses on the major objective your clients&#13;
    hope to achieve. It derives from a long-term regional, national, or local&#13;
    development strategy. The knowledge exchange initiative should bring&#13;
    your clients closer to realizing this goal, by targeting the institutional&#13;
    constraints preventing its achievement. The development goal there-&#13;
    fore guides the design of your knowledge exchange.&#13;
&#13;
    An effective development goal is locally owned and provides clear&#13;
    economic and social value to targeted beneficiaries. Itâ&#128;&#153;s important to&#13;
    recognize that a knowledge exchange initiative will not result in the&#13;
    development goal, but should contribute to it. In some instances,&#13;
    knowledge exchange can be used to build group consensus on a de-&#13;
    velopment goal itself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s Development Goal&#13;
    The development goal in Tanzania was to improve nutrition and income&#13;
    in Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s rural areas and increase economic growth by restructuring its&#13;
    agricultural sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    1.2. Identify the Institutional Capacity Challenge(s)&#13;
    Three main factors often block the way to realizing the development goal.&#13;
       1.	 Weak stakeholder ownership&#13;
       2.	 Inefficient policy instruments&#13;
       3.	 Ineffective organizational arrangements&#13;
    It helps to break down the institutional capacity challenges into sets of&#13;
    characteristics. (See Table 1). Work with your clients and other stakehold-&#13;
    ers to identify the most important capacity challenges. Doing this will help&#13;
    you design a knowledge exchange initiative that yields meaningful results.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                3&#13;

TANZANIAâ&#128;&#153;S CAPACITY CHALLENGES&#13;
This exchange sought to address two interrelated capacity challenges faced&#13;
by Tanzania:&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Inefficient policy instruments: Policies implemented by Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s National&#13;
     Dairy Development Board (NDDB) and stakeholders had been unsuccessful at&#13;
     establishing effective dairy cooperatives and supply chains.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Ineffective organizational arrangements: The operational efficiency of&#13;
     the NDDB and the Ministry of Agriculture were weak due to poorly focused&#13;
     missions, weak extension services, and insufficient technical knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.3. Consider the Capacity-development Objective(s)&#13;
The capacity-development objective is the institutional change your&#13;
clients and participants seek to realize in society. It should describe&#13;
the desired results to which the knowledge exchange initiative will&#13;
contribute and how these changes will address the key institutional&#13;
capacity challenge(s). Indicating the contributing characteristics tar-&#13;
geted for improvement will make the capacity development objective&#13;
more specific. In the event that the knowledge exchange is part of&#13;
a broader development program, the capacity development objec-&#13;
tive should complement your program objective. While you and your&#13;
clients should have a fairly clear idea of this from the beginning, it will&#13;
be important to revisit the objective with all the participants once they&#13;
have been determined.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TANZANIAâ&#128;&#153;S CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE&#13;
The knowledge exchange initiative focused on improving the performance&#13;
of Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s dairy sector by:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Promoting favorable policies and incentives and the efficient organization of dairy&#13;
   supply chains&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Improving the operational efficiency of the National Dairy Board and the Ministry&#13;
   of Agriculture&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;                                                                          7&#13;

    Exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Step 2.1. Identify the Ideal Participant Profiles&#13;
    Which people/groups are most likely to make this change&#13;
    happen?&#13;
&#13;
    Why are they best placed to do so?&#13;
&#13;
    The success of this knowledge exchange initiative depends on having&#13;
    the right kinds of people involved. Consider those who can and will&#13;
    initiate and manage the changes needed to reach the capacity devel-&#13;
    opment objective. These change agents can be either a homogenous&#13;
    or diverse mix of individuals, groups, and institutions. Most likely one or&#13;
    more of your clients will be involved. But who else should participate?&#13;
    When considering participants, donâ&#128;&#153;t just think about how they might&#13;
    behave or what they can contribute as individuals. Also consider how&#13;
    and what they add to the group dynamic. Putting different kinds of&#13;
    people together with diverse backgrounds and perspectives can result&#13;
    in a powerful learning experience.&#13;
&#13;
      Selecting the participants is a juggling act. The list of knowledge&#13;
      exchange participants will change again and again as you move&#13;
      deeper into planning. This is a natural part of the process, so donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
      get discouraged. Tailoring the exchange to the capacity needs of the&#13;
      participants is what is most important. At the same time, be careful not&#13;
      to lose sight of the objective.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     9&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Talk to your clients when considering participants&#13;
(individuals and groups):&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Who will champion the cause and make the envisioned changes happen?&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Will the knowledge they gain enable them to act or behave in a new way?&#13;
  Will this help them realize the capacity development objective?&#13;
â&#128;¢	 How does the personâ&#128;&#153;s role or status help him/her contribute to the&#13;
  exchange and its aftermath?&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Does this person or group have prior experience in the topic?&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Can the inclusion of this person or group improve the likelihood of&#13;
     realizing the capacity development objective?&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Are different change agents needed to achieve different outcomes?&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Does this person bring a new or different perspective to the group?&#13;
  Sometimes a diverse mix of people can achieve what others with a similar&#13;
  background, role, or status cannot.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Are the prospective participants operating in an environment that lets&#13;
  them act on the knowledge and experience they receive?&#13;
â&#128;¢	 What incentives do they have to apply their learning as expected?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s Participant Profiles&#13;
&#13;
Ideal groups of people included:&#13;
Representatives from Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s National Dairy Board and the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture: These institutions are responsible for dairy&#13;
policies and sector oversight and are uniquely suited to improve the&#13;
operational efficiency of dairy supply chains.&#13;
&#13;
Leading dairy producers, processors, and distributors: These are&#13;
the people who can help push for greater reforms and will eventually&#13;
benefit from having a better system.&#13;
&amp;#12;10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Define the&#13;
     Knowledge&#13;
     Exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Step 2.2. Consider the Desired Capacity Outcomes&#13;
     What specific, measurable changes are desired?&#13;
&#13;
     Will these changes help measure progress towards the capacity&#13;
     development objective?&#13;
&#13;
     In Step 1 you considered the context for this exchange, including the&#13;
     development goal and the institutional capacity challenges prevent-&#13;
     ing its achievement. You also discussed the capacity development ob-&#13;
     jective with your clientsâ&#128;&#148;what will change in society as a result of the&#13;
     knowledge gained through this initiative. While the capacity objective&#13;
     could be reached through a single knowledge exchange initiative, it&#13;
     is not very likely. However, progress towards the capacity objective is&#13;
     measurable. These intermediate steps, or capacity outcomes, are what&#13;
     we expect to see, measure and report after a knowledge exchange ini-&#13;
     tiative.&#13;
&#13;
     The capacity outcomes reflect the specific changes the participants are&#13;
     looking to achieve at the individual and group levelâ&#128;&#148;what they want&#13;
     to learn and how they want to change. Six general capacity outcomes&#13;
     form the basis of all change processes. The capacity outcomes will vary&#13;
     depending on the challenges your clients and participants aim to ad-&#13;
     dress, how they want to address them, and who is involved. Getting the&#13;
     capacity outcomes right is really importantâ&#128;&#148;the outcomes are how we&#13;
     define and measure progress toward the capacity development objec-&#13;
     tives.&#13;
&#13;
     Again, while you and your clients should establish the capacity out-&#13;
     comes at the beginning, it will be important to revisit them with all the&#13;
     participants once they have been determined. At that time, you will ask&#13;
     them, â&#128;&#156;What do you want to learn?â&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;How do you hope to grow?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                          11&#13;

     Exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Use the table below to help participants identify their desired capacity out-&#13;
     comes.&#13;
     A â&#128;&#156;NOâ&#128;&#157; indicates a possible learning gap. Consider whether this is something&#13;
     that the knowledge exchange should address in order to achieve the capacity&#13;
     development objective.&#13;

          â&#128;¢	 Is there a policy or strategy already in place that&#13;
             supports the envisioned changes related to the capacity-&#13;
             development objective?                                         New implementation know-how&#13;

     Capacity Outcomes Sought by Tanzania&#13;
     Enhanced Knowledge and Skills: Officials in the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), National Dairy&#13;
     Development Board (NDDB), dairy producers, processors, and distributors will have a better&#13;
     understanding of the constraints facing Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s dairy sector and be better equipped to&#13;
     develop effective policies to improve performance.&#13;
&#13;
     Improved Consensus: Exchange participants will reach agreement on a blueprint of&#13;
     potential dairy sector reforms appropriate in Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
     Increased Implementation Know-how: NDDB participants gain first-hand experience&#13;
     attempting reforms through a rapid results approach. This helps them identify constraints and&#13;
     challenges before rolling out reforms on a larger scale.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Step 2.3. Identify the Most Appropriate Knowledge&#13;
Providers&#13;
Which individuals or groups have the most relevant and&#13;
transferable knowledge and experience to share?&#13;
Do they have the resources and capacity to share it?&#13;
&#13;
Having the right knowledge providers is key to a successful knowledge&#13;
exchange. Knowledge providers can be individuals, groups, or institu-&#13;
tions hailing from the private, public, or civil sectors. Knowledge pro-&#13;
viders can come from the same country or region, or from somewhere&#13;
completely different. In many instances, the roles of knowledge provid-&#13;
ers and knowledge recipients are not very distinct. Some knowledge&#13;
exchange instruments are designed specifically for this mutual learning&#13;
and knowledge sharing. This is addressed in greater detail in Step 3.&#13;
When selecting knowledge providers, consider whether they can claim&#13;
the following:&#13;
&#13;
QQ Demonstrated success in effectively addressing similar development&#13;
   challenges&#13;
QQ Relevant experience in providing this knowledge, receiving delega-&#13;
   tions, and applying the proposed knowledge exchange methods (See&#13;
   Step 3)&#13;
QQ Available resources that the proposed institution(s) can mobilize to plan&#13;
   and implement the knowledge exchange in the proposed timeframe&#13;
QQ Readiness to deliver, as evidenced by confirmed commitment and a&#13;
   clear distribution of responsibilities&#13;
QQ Prior relationships between proposed delegations in the knowledge-&#13;
   provider and knowledge-receiving institutions, groups, or individuals&#13;
QQ Understanding of potential logistical issues and risks, such as how&#13;
   to address language issues, potential travel challenges, and so on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As in participant selection, try to find a good mix of knowledge providers&#13;
that can share different perspectives on the issue. You want to expose&#13;
participants to many points of view, to allow them to see how something&#13;
has worked at all levels, including operational, social, and political.&#13;

&#13;
Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s Knowledge Providers&#13;
&#13;
Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s National Dairy Development Board: This preeminent oversight&#13;
agency was instrumental in catalyzing the countryâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;White Revolution,â&#128;&#157;&#13;
which led to an increase in Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s milk production from 20 to 100 million&#13;
metric tons in only 40 years . The NDDB is interested in sharing its&#13;
experiences in analyzing constraints and restructuring dairy operations, and&#13;
brings a proven track record in undertaking exchanges worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
The Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation: Can provide&#13;
direct linkages to a cooperative that dramatically scaled up its operations,&#13;
especially through its global brand, AMUL.&#13;
&#13;
Both organizations have confirmed resources to deliver all exchange activities&#13;
within the noted timeframe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The knowledge provider(s) may change for any number of reasons as&#13;
    planning progresses. This is a natural part of the process, so donâ&#128;&#153;t get&#13;
    discouraged. Finding the right match for your clients and participants is&#13;
    what counts. The ideal knowledge provider must both be available and&#13;
    willing to share the details of their development experience.&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;                                                                               17&#13;

Design and&#13;
Develop the&#13;
Knowledge&#13;
Exchange&#13;
   If you feel you are ready for designing and developing without having&#13;
   thought through the development context and defining key components&#13;
   of your knowledge exchange, you should stop! Take a few minutes&#13;
   to look at Steps 1 and 2. Getting the beginning right will dramatically&#13;
   increase the chances that the time and effort from you, your clients, the&#13;
   participants, and the knowledge providers is well spent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This is when the initiative starts to take shape. In designing and devel-&#13;
oping the knowledge exchange, you will tighten up your participant list,&#13;
work with your key stakeholders to determine the capacity objective&#13;
and expected outcomes, assemble your exchange, and plan how to&#13;
measure the results of your exchange.&#13;

                Assemble your Knowledge Exchange Initiative&#13;
                  a) Consider the operating constraints&#13;
                  b) Select the Knowledge Exchange Instrument(s)&#13;
                  c) Select and sequence the activities (building blocks of the&#13;

                                                     Design and Develop the&#13;
                                                       Knowledge Exchange&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 3.1. Select the Participants&#13;
Which individuals are best placed to benefit from the knowledge&#13;
exchange and act on what is learned?&#13;
When considering who to invite (and who not), work with your clients&#13;
and any participants already identified. Your knowledge exchange par-&#13;
ticipants should be well positioned to leverage the learning and expe-&#13;
rience they will gain. Seek the championsâ&#128;&#148;those who are open to re-&#13;
form and who will drive the desired change. Ask yourself the question,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Who from my target participant groups is best placed to benefit from&#13;
the knowledge exchange and act on what is learned?â&#128;&#157; Consult Table 2&#13;
(Page 9) again for help in selecting participants.&#13;
&#13;
Once you have the perfect list, know that it may still change! As plans&#13;
firm up, some participants wonâ&#128;&#153;t be available, some will drop out, and&#13;
others will want to join. Donâ&#128;&#153;t get discouraged. This is part of the pro-&#13;
cess. The important thing is to maintain the momentum and regularly&#13;
involve your participants in the planning. By the time itâ&#128;&#153;s ready to launch,&#13;
you and your participants will have formed a strong sense of the knowl-&#13;
edge exchange objectives and expected outcomes. If a new participant&#13;
can help to achieve these or even expand the outcomes, he or she will&#13;
be a good addition to the team.&#13;
&#13;

   Selected Participants from Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s National Dairy Board and&#13;
   Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
   These individuals are responsible for dairy policies and sector oversight&#13;
   and are uniquely suited to improve the operational efficiency of dairy&#13;
   supply chains. They are proven champions of reform and were selected&#13;
   because of their desire to apply learning and share it with others.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Step 3.2. Agree on the Capacity Objective&#13;
     and Outcomes&#13;
     What do the participants want to learn?&#13;
     How do they hope to grow?&#13;
     Now that you have identified the participants (or at least many of them), verify&#13;
     that you and your clientsâ&#128;&#153; assumptions regarding the development goal, institu-&#13;
     tional challenges, and capacity objective are accurate. If not, work with your par-&#13;
     ticipants and clients to determine these before tackling the capacity outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
     The capacity outcomes are the specific changes clients and participants&#13;
     seek to realize as a result of the knowledge exchange. It is therefore&#13;
     critical that your participants be involved in determining them. The suc-&#13;
     cess of the exchange depends on having participants own the results.&#13;
&#13;
     Determining the expected capacity outcomes can be done in a number of&#13;
     ways, including:&#13;
     QQ Meeting face-to-face or virtually with all the participants, or a representa-&#13;
         tive sample, to discuss and produce a draft list.&#13;
     QQ Circulating the proposed capacity outcomes, drafted by you and your cli-&#13;
         ents, for inputs from the participants. If taking this approach, encourage&#13;
         your clients to own the outcomes by writing new ones if necessary. The&#13;
         capacity outcomes should be theirs, or it is doubtful the knowledge ex-&#13;
         change will result in anything substantial. Please refer to the example on&#13;
         Capacity Outcomes ( Page 11)&#13;
&#13;
     It is important to check in with the knowledge provider(s) during this&#13;
     time. What they know and are able to share can help shape the capacity&#13;
     outcomes. These conversations may also highlight the need for an ad-&#13;
     ditional knowledge provider or a replacement of the original(s).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     6 Capacity Outcomes (More information on page 11)&#13;
     1.	 Raised awareness                    4.	 Strengthened coalitions&#13;
     2.	 Enhanced knowledge and              5.	 Enhanced networks&#13;
         skills                              6.	 Increased implementation&#13;
     3.	 Improved consensus and                  know-how&#13;
         teamwork&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                            21&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Step 3.3. Assemble the Knowledge Exchange Initiative&#13;
Every knowledge exchange initiative consists of an integrated blend of&#13;
instruments, activities, and delivery modes. Selecting the right mix of&#13;
these will help participants realize their capacity development outcomes.&#13;
When assembling your initiative follow the steps in figure 4 below.&#13;

3.3a. Consider the Operating Constraints&#13;
What are the human, environmental, budgetary, and time con-&#13;
straints limiting the knowledge exchange initiative?&#13;
Among the first things to consider at an early design stage are the op-&#13;
erating constraints. Think about:&#13;
QQ The time available to plan and complete the exchange&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Is this a longer-term learning initiative? Or do the participants&#13;
      have an immediate learning need?&#13;
QQ The participants and their availability and ability to contribute to the&#13;
   initiative&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Can the Vice Minister of Finance take a full week off from her regu-&#13;

3.3b. Select the Knowledge Exchange Instrument(s)&#13;
Which instrument(s) will work within the operating constraints and&#13;
help participants achieve the capacity outcomes?&#13;
Most knowledge exchange initiatives consist of one or more instru-&#13;
ments. They can be used alone or in combination. Each instrument has&#13;
its own strengths and limitations, with some more suitable for particular&#13;
types of learning than others. The choice of instrument will also be af-&#13;
fected by participant profile, group size, time, logistical constraints, and&#13;
the resources available. Each knowledge exchange instrument should&#13;
be designed in a way that helps achieve the capacity outcomes the&#13;
group has set out for itself.&#13;
&#13;
Selecting an instrument or mix of instruments for your participants is&#13;
like considering what menu to prepare for a group of important din-&#13;
ner guests. Knowing these people, you should have a fairly good idea&#13;
of what will be appreciated, and what will not (especially since youâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
already met and discussed expectations in Step 3.2). Suppose you de-&#13;
cide on a hearty soupâ&#128;&#148;it would be enough by itself, but by comple-&#13;
menting it with good bread you make a meal. Similarly, you may find&#13;
that one knowledge exchange instrument will meet your participantsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
basic needs, but by mixing it with another instrument you can leave&#13;
them fully satisfied.&#13;

   Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s Selection of Knowledge Exchange Instruments&#13;
   A working group from Tanzania and India planned the exchange&#13;
   together. It was anchored by a 10-day expert visit to Tanzania by six&#13;
   officials from the Indian National Development Dairy Board and the&#13;
   Gujarat Federation. Then a small delegation of 14 Tanzanian officials from&#13;
   the Ministry of Agriculture, National Development Dairy Board, dairy&#13;
   producers, processors, and distributors visited India on a study tour to&#13;
   see first-hand how the Indians had implemented these recommendations&#13;
   in their own countryâ&#128;&#148;and the results of their work.&#13;

     3.3c. Selecting and Sequencing Activities&#13;
     Which activities will most help participants achieve the desired ca-&#13;
     pacity outcomes?&#13;
     Whatâ&#128;&#153;s the best sequence for the activities?&#13;
     Knowledge exchange activities are the actions through which learning&#13;
     takes place. Common activities are presentations, group discussions,&#13;
     brainstorms, and action planning sessions. Each activity should con-&#13;
     tribute to the participantsâ&#128;&#153; desired capacity outcomes. Like the instru-&#13;
     ments, each activity has its own strengths and limitations, with some&#13;
     more suitable for particular types of learning than others. Activity choice&#13;
     will also be affected by participant profile, group size, time, logistical&#13;
     constraints, and the resources available.&#13;
&#13;
     Going back to our cooking analogy, the activities are like the special in-&#13;
     gredients that make up your soup. These ingredients can be added to&#13;
     the knowledge exchange instrument in different orders. This sequenc-&#13;
     ing, or deciding when to use one activity in relation to another, is an-&#13;
     other factor to consider when selecting activities. Some activities are&#13;
     more suitable in the knowledge exchange planning phase, while others&#13;
     are more effective in delivery and follow-up.&#13;
&#13;
     Well-designed activities will allow participants to:&#13;

Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s Study Tour to India&#13;
Preparation:&#13;
&#13;
To prepare for the second phase of their knowledge exchange initiative,&#13;
the study tour, Tanzania and India organized a preliminary brainstorm&#13;
through videoconference to define the scope of the visit and an&#13;
eDiscussion to prepare a concept note for the visit.&#13;
&#13;
Delivery:&#13;
&#13;
The study tour included presentations and field visits aimed at learning&#13;
about Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s dairy revolution and how it was implemented, from both&#13;
a political and practical standpoint. In addition, group discussions were&#13;
arranged with Indian business leaders to promote future partnerships for&#13;
improving Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s dairy sector.&#13;
&#13;
Follow up:&#13;
&#13;
A series of presentations to colleagues and decision makers back home&#13;
provided an opportunity for the Tanzanians to share lessons learned and&#13;
propose a way forward.&#13;

                    Designing a Group Discussion for the Tanzanian Delegation and Indian Business Leaders&#13;
                    Prior to delivering this activity, the following will need to be considered:&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 Guest list: Which companies should be invited and why?&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 Timing: When should they meet? For how long?&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 Format: Will there be a moderator? What can be done to help both groups get&#13;
                       what they want out of the exchange?&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 Location: Where is the most convenient place for everyone to meet? Is this&#13;
                       location conducive to promoting networking and conversation?&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 Next steps: What can be done to ensure this activity leads to something useful?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                             31&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.3d. Design the Activities&#13;
How should each activity be managed and delivered?&#13;
Once youâ&#128;&#153;ve selected and sequenced your activities, you should think&#13;
about how youâ&#128;&#153;re going to design and deliver them. For example, when&#13;
designing an action planning session, you would start with a prepara-&#13;
tory meeting to:&#13;
QQ Define what you hope to accomplish&#13;
&#13;
QQ Assign roles and responsibilities (facilitator, key participants, other&#13;
   resource people for content preparation etc.)&#13;
QQ Prepare the agenda and the list of materials needed&#13;
&#13;
QQ Create a timeline with major milestones leading up to the session&#13;
&#13;
QQ Review budget and logistics&#13;
&#13;
A single knowledge exchange initiative will consist of many activities.&#13;
Some activities are more complex than others and will require great-&#13;
er planningâ&#128;&#148;for example, an immersive learning experience will take&#13;
some serious thought and may require additional staff support to pull&#13;
off, whereas a group discussion is probably something you can organize&#13;
quite quickly with little help.&#13;
&#13;
Another thing to consider while designing your activities is the way in&#13;
which they will be delivered. Delivery can be in real time or staggered,&#13;
in person or virtual. Some methods are better for building trust and&#13;
consensus, whereas others promote greater participation and deeper&#13;
reflection. Some are cheap, others expensive. See Annex III for more on&#13;
delivery modes.&#13;
&#13;
Keep in mind that the success of a knowledge exchange initiative rests&#13;
on the achievement of the targeted capacity outcomes rather than on&#13;
the delivery of a predetermined set of activities or even instruments.&#13;
Individual activities within a knowledge exchange instrument, or even&#13;
the instrument itself, might need to be adjusted during implementation&#13;
to better ensure that learning goals are met.&#13;

Step 3.4. Plan the Results Measurement&#13;
How will you know whether the exchange is successful or not?&#13;
A knowledge exchange without results is not fruitful. The main purpose&#13;
of this planning guide is to help you ensure that your knowledge ex-&#13;
change initiativeâ&#128;&#148;and all the work you and others put into itâ&#128;&#148;leads to&#13;
results.&#13;
&#13;
Each capacity outcome targeted by the knowledge exchange initiative&#13;
can and should be measured. As the knowledge exchange organizer,&#13;
you want to know and be able to demonstrate how participants have&#13;
been empowered to achieve the capacity outcomes they set for them-&#13;
selves, and how this contributes toward the institutional change your&#13;
clients and participants seek to realize.&#13;
&#13;
Capacity outcomes can be assessed in numerous ways. The following&#13;
table illustrates a few possibilities.&#13;

     The process of selecting and assigning measures should always include the consideration&#13;
     of existing data sources and the feasibility of collecting relevant data. Whenever possible,&#13;
     it is important to establish the following for any measure(s) used. (See table 8, page 35)&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 35&#13;

 The baseline         A quantitative or qualitative statement that explains the value of a&#13;
 value at the start   measure before the knowledge exchange is implemented or at its&#13;
 of the initiative    beginning. Identifying the baseline value for each measure allows&#13;
                      practitioners to later assess any changes in the measured value that&#13;
                      could be attributed to the program.&#13;
 Targets or           Targeted outcomes can only be confirmed if target value(s) are&#13;
 benchmarks           established at the beginning of the initiative. The target value should be&#13;
 for progress at      expressed in terms that are comparable to the baseline value. Consider&#13;
                      what is feasible given the people involved, the instruments, activities,&#13;

                      and delivery modes used, and the available timeframe of the exchange.&#13;
 or stages (e.g.,&#13;
 after specific       Specify the estimated confirmation date of each capacity outcome.&#13;
                      Some capacity outcomes can be assessed during the program (i.e.&#13;
 events)&#13;
                      after a specific event), whereas others might need more time to be&#13;
                      confirmed.&#13;
 Methods, tools,      The achievement of capacity outcomes can be analyzed by monitoring&#13;
 and roles/           changes in the indicators over time. This is why regularly tracking&#13;
 responsibilities     program progress is critical. The data collection methods and the tools&#13;
                      necessary to utilize them should be clarified and responsible agents&#13;
 for collecting&#13;
                      identified in order to ensure implementation. Example monitoring&#13;
 and analyzing        methods and tools include:&#13;

There are plenty of issues to address at the implementation phase, and&#13;
usually the planning for this phase starts well before the initiative is&#13;
ready for implementation. A great deal depends on the delivery modes&#13;
that have been selected, but mostly implementation involves project&#13;
management and logistics or fine-tuning of the activities and agenda.&#13;

            An action plan is a personal or group agenda that describes how a participant, or participants,&#13;
            will implement the knowledge gained in a given knowledge exchange activity. A participant or&#13;
            group usually creates an action plan with the assistance of a facilitator. An action plan provides&#13;
            participants with a tangible output and road map for follow-up actions.&#13;

            What Is an e-Discussion?&#13;
            An e-discussion is a knowledge exchange activity that permits the participants to consider a&#13;
            question or topic online in an open setting, formal or informal. E-discussions are asynchronousâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
            that is, communication does not have to occur at the same time. E-discussions are managed online&#13;
            through a discussion forum environment or tool. This kind of knowledge exchange is flexible, as&#13;
            participants do not need to be available at a fixed time to discuss something, but can engage&#13;
            when available within the established parameters of the e-discussion.&#13;

            Some examples of group discussions include topic-based discussions, case-based discussions&#13;
            where information about the situation is given to the group and they are asked as a group to&#13;

            What Is a Role-Play?&#13;
            Role-playing is a highly interactive activity in which participants act out situations and problems&#13;
            and then analyze the situation with the help of other role-players and observers. This type of&#13;
            activity requires an experienced facilitator.&#13;

            What Is a Survey?&#13;
            A survey is a way to gather information from participantsâ&#128;&#148;for example, about what their&#13;
            knowledge needs are, how well they understand content presented to them, or what their opinions&#13;
            are on the usefulness of what has been presented. Surveys can be used before, during, or after&#13;
            a knowledge exchange to make learning more relevant, interactive, and useful for learners.&#13;
            Surveys are also effective as a polling tool to prompt discussions, surface areas for consensus&#13;
            or stakeholder ownership, and prioritize important next steps or action items and outputs from&#13;
            knowledge-exchange activities. Simple polling tools are available that allow participants to&#13;
            respond to questions from a facilitator in real time.&#13;

                                        narrative responses require more intensive data analysis for processing the&#13;

 Other Key       Here is one example of how to use a survey as a learning method:&#13;
 Considerations:     1.	 The facilitator surveys participants by posing a multiple-choice question.&#13;
                          2.	 Participants respond to the question. There are three common tools for&#13;
                              answering the question:&#13;
                          Â»Â»   Raising hands (participants often feel inhibited in responding candidly).&#13;
                          Â»Â»   Raising a flash card. All participants are given flash cards numbered 1 to 4&#13;
                               or with different colors/ symbols. When asked the question, all respond at&#13;
                               the same time with their choice. Participants are less likely to feel watched by&#13;
                               others while responding and more likely to be candid with their answers.&#13;
                          Â»Â»   Submitting an answer using a hand-held polling tool that looks like a remote control.&#13;
                               A polling tool provides anonymous responses, encouraging a candid response.&#13;
                          3.	 Survey information is collected. The facilitator is responsible for noting the&#13;
                              response trend when participants raise their hands or flash cards. With a&#13;
                              polling tool, software on the facilitatorâ&#128;&#153;s computer collects responses and&#13;
                              produces a chart showing what choices participants made.&#13;
                          4.	 The survey responses are used to inform the activity and guide the next steps.&#13;

            What Is a Simulation Exercise?&#13;
            A simulation exercise presents a realistic, structured situation and invites learners to interact in that&#13;
            setting with objects and/or people (i.e., through role-play, building models, and computer games).&#13;
            Simulation overlaps with and differs from role-play: in both, the goal is to create realistic situations;&#13;
            but in role-play, the focus is on realistic human relations. Many simulations are in the form of&#13;
            games; the most successful simulation is the real-estate game â&#128;&#156;Monopoly.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
            Simulations vary in how simple or complex they are, and how large a role they have in a learning&#13;
            event: they can be the bulk of an event (e.g., simulated cadavers as a course at some medical&#13;
            schools) or partial (e.g., financial planning games).&#13;

            What Is Brainstorming?&#13;
            Brainstorming is a powerful knowledge-exchange activity that can be used for generating ideas or&#13;
            solutions about a specific topic or for problem-solving, team-building, and creative processes. A&#13;
            brainstorming session should tap into the wisdom of peers; encourage novel, out-of-the-box ideas;&#13;
            and be done at the initial stages of a project or process.&#13;
            The key goal of brainstorming sessions is to generate as many ideas as possible from&#13;
            participantsâ&#128;&#148;original ideas or ideas that build from each other. Quantity is what counts at this&#13;
            stage, not quality. For this reason it is important that participants be aware that â&#128;&#156;no idea is a bad&#13;
            idea.â&#128;&#157; Participants should refrain from judging ideas as they are shared. A successful brainstorm&#13;
            should result in many bold and unique ideas that can then be analyzed, prioritized, and applied in&#13;
            relevant contexts.&#13;

             How Do I       â&#128;¢	       It generally helps to have two people for a demonstration activityâ&#128;&#148;one to&#13;
             Create an               run the demonstration and the other to present.&#13;
             Effective&#13;
                            â&#128;¢	       Every presentation should be as customized as possible.&#13;
             Demonstration?&#13;
                                â&#128;¢	   The demonstration should be followed by a brief question-and-answer session.&#13;
                                â&#128;¢	   Each member of the group must be given an opportunity to practice process steps.&#13;
                                â&#128;¢	   The technique works best in smaller groups (5 to 20 people).&#13;
                                â&#128;¢	   Individual guidance during the practice session is important.&#13;
                                â&#128;¢	   The expert should have good pedagogical skills and should adapt the&#13;
                                     demonstration for the needs of the audience.&#13;
                                â&#128;¢	   Sufficient time should be made available for all the steps, including&#13;
                                     discussion after practice.&#13;
                                â&#128;¢	   Follow-up performance support should be made available to help with the&#13;
                                     practical application in the participantsâ&#128;&#153; contexts.&#13;

&#13;
               What Is the      â&#128;¢	   Demonstrations often require substantive preparation time. The expertâ&#128;&#153;s or&#13;

                                â&#128;¢	   Help the audience understand the context of the demonstration and how&#13;
                                     it relates to them.&#13;
&amp;#12;   What Is the      â&#128;¢	   Be confident in his/her ability to perform the task.&#13;
   Facilitatorâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	   Present the solution to address the problems, showing only the features,&#13;
   Role?&#13;
                         benefits, and capabilities that relate to those issues.&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	   Describe the steps of the process as it is being demonstrated.&#13;

                         the audience how they see the issue.&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	   Provide follow-up performance-support tools and options.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  What Is the       Good demonstrations should have a high level of participant involvement.&#13;
  Participantsâ&#128;&#153;     Participants need to:&#13;

                    â&#128;¢	 Listen actively and watch carefully.&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 Ask questions when the information or process is not clear.&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 Practice the process steps.&#13;

  Other Key       Are the expected outputs of the demonstration session clear?&#13;
  Considerations:&#13;
                    Have you decided how to run the demonstration session?&#13;
                    Did you establish the ground rules for the session?&#13;
                    Have you considered the logistical, resource, and equipment needs for this&#13;
                    session?&#13;
&amp;#12;Annex III:&#13;
Activity&#13;
Delivery&#13;
Modes&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;ACTIVITY DELIVERY&#13;
MODES&#13;
The way in which knowledge exchange participants interact&#13;
with one another or with learning content is called the delivery&#13;
mode. A delivery mode is either synchronous (occurring at the&#13;
same time) or asynchronous (occurring at different times).&#13;
      Synchronous knowledge exchange: Formats include&#13;
      face-to-face, audio, online chat, and video conferencing.&#13;
      Synchronous delivery modes are useful for encouraging&#13;
      dialogue, and when trying to build trust and consensus.&#13;
      Asynchronous knowledge exchange: Formats include&#13;
      e-learning, online discussion forums, online social&#13;
      networking, and email. These methods are increasingly&#13;
      being blended with face to face delivery, as they&#13;
      provide participants with greater flexibility in access and&#13;
      participation, allow for sustained interaction in a cost-&#13;
      effective way, and encourage deeper reflection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The choice for one delivery mode or another is usually&#13;
determined by a number of constraints.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Cost: Face-to-face and videoconferencing behave very&#13;
      similarly in terms of cost. It costs less per participant to use&#13;
      videoconferencing than face-to-face, but for both modes&#13;
      there are no economies of scale. E-learning, on the other&#13;
      hand, requires a lot of preparation time, but once it is&#13;
      ready it becomes by far the cheapest delivery mode.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Access to technology: Video conferencing, e-learning&#13;
      and other online knowledge exchange activities require&#13;
      access to certain technologies. Most online platforms are&#13;
      free to use or cost very little. Video conferencing requires&#13;
      special equipment and facilities.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Audience characteristics: The schedules and profiles&#13;
      of high level people are best suited for synchronous&#13;
      delivery modes such as face to face sessions and video-&#13;
&amp;#12;   conferencing, .while, large or distributed audiences are&#13;
   best reached through asynchronous delivery modes.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Literacy (including digital literacy): Your participants&#13;
   should feel comfortable with the technology used for&#13;
   delivery in order to engage effectively in the activity.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Language: Accommodating multiple languages can&#13;
   be challenging. Simultaneous interpretation is easier&#13;
   for presentations and in KE activities where there is&#13;
   more structure. Asynchronous activities allow time for&#13;
   translation.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Cultural background and Individual learning styles:&#13;
   Some people prefer learning passively (i.e., through&#13;
   presentation, demonstration, etc.) and others prefer active&#13;
   or experiential learning (i.e., through role play, simulation,&#13;
   or dialogue).&#13;
â&#128;¢	 External environment: Natural disasters can affect&#13;
   the possibility of travel, of convening, or of access to&#13;
   technology.&#13;

            The art of knowledge exchange : a
            results-focused planning guide for development practitioners
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This guide emphasizes empowering local
            agents through experiential learning with peers from their
            own and other countries by following a strategic,
            results-oriented approach to learning based on the World
            Bank Institute's Capacity Development and Results
            Framework. Knowledge exchange, or peer-to-peer learning, is
            an important way to share, replicate, and scale up what
            works in development. Development practitioners want to
            learn from the practical experience of others who have gone
            through, or are going through, similar problems. The
            capacity-development objective is the institutional change
            your clients and participants seek to realize in society. It
            should describe the desired results to which the knowledge
            exchange initiative will contribute and how these changes
            will address the key institutional capacity challenges. The
            success of this knowledge exchange initiative depends on
            having the right kinds of people involved. Consider those
            who can and will initiate and manage the changes needed to
            reach the capacity development objective. These change
            agents can be either a homogenous or diverse mix of
            individuals, groups, and institutions. Most likely one or
            more of your clients will be involved. But who else should
            participate? When considering participants, don't just
            think about how they might behave or what they can
            contribute as individuals. Also consider how and what they
            add to the group dynamic. The capacity outcomes reflect the
            specific changes the participants are looking to achieve at
            the individual and group level what they want to learn and
            how they want to change. Six general capacity outcomes form
            the basis of all change processes.
