            Telling our story : jobs - private sector
            development solutions
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The new issue focuses on IFC's role
            in one of the world's biggest issues: jobs. Creating
            jobs is one of the private sector's jobs. IFC works
            with governments and businesses to help make it happen. We
            identify the biggest obstacles that stand in the way to
            employment growth, then help remove them. Clear away those
            obstacles, and job creation follows. It is far from easy,
            but it works. It has been seen time and again, in country
            after country. To break down the barriers to job creation,
            IFC provides investment, advisory services, and asset
            management, complementing the World Bank's policy
            support, loans, and grants to governments. IFC helps the
            private sector achieve significant increases in employment
            by focusing on: 1) investment climate reforms that help
            entrepreneurs start and grow their businesses; 2)
            infrastructure improvements that help businesses access
            markets and become globally competitive; 3) access to
            finance that companies need for investment and growth 4)
            skills that equip workers, especially young people, to find
            the employment they need and give entrepreneurs new ways to
            build their businesses; 5) supply and distribution chains
            that connect smaller firms to larger ones, especially in
            manufacturing, extractive industries, and agribusiness; and
            6) working conditions for improving environmental and social
            performance, including good working conditions. This is the
            package IFC offers. It is based on what the governments and
            private enterprises tell us would do the most to encourage
            job creation, benefiting firms of all sizes but especially
            the key job creators: micro, small, and medium enterprises.
