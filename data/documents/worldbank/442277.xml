AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:                    People's Republic of Bangladesh&#13;
Beneficiaries:              National research  institutions, researchers, extension&#13;
workers, farmers&#13;
Executing agencies:          Eight national research institutions&#13;
Amount:                      Credit SDR33.6 million (US$50.0 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:                       Standard, with a maturity of 40 years&#13;
Project objectives:          The project objective is to increase the efficiency of the&#13;
national agricultural research system. The project would&#13;
achieve its objective through: (a) improving research&#13;
organization and management;  (b) supporting priority&#13;
research programs on promising areas; (c) strengthening&#13;
client orientation; and (d) improving research resource&#13;
allocation.&#13;
Project components:         The project would have three components: (a) Research&#13;
organization and management (US$13.99 million),&#13;
focusing on institutional policy reforms and strengthening&#13;
research planning in BARC and ARls;  (b) Priority&#13;
Research (US$40.57 million) in the ARIs on crops,&#13;
fisheries, livestock and forestry and with other institutions&#13;
through contract research managed by BARC; and&#13;
(c) Participatory Farming Systems (US$4.56) research&#13;
linkages to improve technology transfer. The project would&#13;
finance civil works, local and imported goods and equipment&#13;
(farm, office, laboratory, and vehicles), contract research,&#13;
technical assistance, training, labor, and incremental staff&#13;
and operating costs.&#13;
Costs and financing plan:   Total project costs are estimated at US$59.1 million. Project&#13;
baseline costs are estimated at US$52.9 million; physical&#13;
contingencies are estimated to be US$ 2.2 million and price&#13;
contingencies are estimated to be US$ 4.0 million. An IDA&#13;
credit would provide US$50.0 million and the Government&#13;
of Bangladesh would provide US$9.1 million. Of the total&#13;
project cost, US$46.2 million would be for investment and&#13;
US$12.9 would be for incremental recurrent costs.&#13;
Benefits:                    The project would assist in the generation of more&#13;
productive agricultural (crops, livestock, fisheries, and&#13;
forestry) technology. Support to research linkages and&#13;
adaptation would lead to stronger linkages with farmers,&#13;
extension services and NGOs, and promote the development&#13;
of adoptable technology and a stronger foundation for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
transfer of such technology to farmers, thus increasing&#13;
production and income.&#13;
Risks:                      There are four major risks. They are the Governmenes&#13;
ability and commitment to: (a) complete the agreed&#13;
institutional reforms; (b) manage research, including&#13;
interagency coordination; (c) allocate adequate funds to&#13;
research; and (d) implement all project provisions, including&#13;
technical assistance and training. These risks are addressed&#13;
as follows: (a) institutional reforms were agreed in advance&#13;
and are supported by a policy statement from the Minister of&#13;
Agriculture to IDA. The executive orders to implement the&#13;
new research management procedures would be issues&#13;
before   effectiveness;   (b) strengthening    research&#13;
management, staff development, and coordination among&#13;
agencies and clients, including extension, NGOs and&#13;
farmers; (c) a satisfactory arrangement has been made to&#13;
transfer adequate allocations to the revenue budgets for the&#13;
project. The Government agreed at negotiations that&#13;
adequate funds would be made available for the project; and&#13;
(d) timely establishment of a special account for each&#13;
implementing agency, appointment of key managerial&#13;
positions and recruitment of consultants, streamlining&#13;
implementation of training and contract research, and&#13;
maintaining a project subcommittee at BARC to monitor&#13;
implementation. IDA supervision and a mid-term review&#13;
will identify problems and suggest correctives.&#13;
Economic Rate of Return:    The economic rates of return (ERRs) of the expected benefits&#13;
of research on 35 major commodities, comprising more than&#13;
95% of agricultural output, were estimated to be greater than&#13;
12 percent for 32 of the 35 commodities. The average of the&#13;
values across ARIs was 53.4%, ranging from 11.1 % (BJRI,&#13;
jute research) to 90.7 % (BRRI, rice research).&#13;

AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
1. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.1    Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an average income of US$220 in&#13;
1993 and with about half its population living in poverty. Agriculture (crops, livestock, fisheries and&#13;
forestry) is vital in the economy, accounting for about 30 percent of GDP, 65 percent of employment and&#13;
17 percent of commodity export earnings. Economic growth sufficient to relieve poverty requires, therefore,&#13;
significant growth in agricultural output and productivity or a massive shift of people out of agriculture&#13;
into other sectors.&#13;
1.2    Raising agricultural output confronts several challenges. The first is to grow from a resource base&#13;
that is already very intensively used. The projected 1996 population of about 123 million people lives on&#13;
14.8 million hectares (ha), making Bangladesh the most densely populated country in the world. Arable&#13;
land covers 8.1 million ha--or roughly 55 percent of the national area--with another 1.9 million ha in forest&#13;
or woodland, so there is no possibility to grow by cultivating more land. Of the national total of roughly 19&#13;
million households, about 14 million are farm households and 7.7 million are rural landless; the landless,&#13;
and those operating holdings of less than 0.5 hectares (ha), have little or no asset base in which to invest.&#13;
Lastly, while expansion of irrigation and fertilizer use have contributed to recent growth, additional&#13;
irrigable land is becoming scarcer, the costs of new irrigation are expected to rise, and the marginal returns&#13;
to fertilizer have fallen from the levels of the mid-1980s. Though significant potential for exploitation of&#13;
inexpensive groundwater exists, the cheapest irrigation opportunities have already been used.&#13;
1.3   The second challenge is water control. While rainfall and surface waters are usually abundant,&#13;
recurrent droughts and floods make it difficult to sustain growth. Because production will always be&#13;
subject to the onset and intensity of the monsoons and to the severity of the dry season, costly investments&#13;
in irrigation, drainage, and flood control are needed to manage water, maintain coastlines and river banks&#13;
against erosion, to prevent salt water incursion and to protect inland fisheries from disruption by flood&#13;
control and drainage activities.&#13;
1.4   The third challenge is the heterogeneity of agriculture. Arable land has been classified into 30&#13;
agro-ecological zones (AEZs) and 80 subzones according to soil type, land shape, probability of flooding,&#13;
length of growing season, and temperature.  Although temperatures are generally suitable for crop&#13;
production throughout the year, distinct hot, warm and cool seasons make farm management complex in&#13;
terms of the appropriate mix of crops, livestock, forestry, aquatic species, and other activities. The various&#13;
zones require site-specific management practices which must be generated by research and promulgated by&#13;
extension.&#13;
1.5    Agricultural growth. Agriculture grew at 3.2 percent annually in the 1960s and at 2.5 percent&#13;
from 1973-1987. Total factor productivity growth--the contribution to output of research, technology&#13;
transfer, education, and markets--expanded by 0.78 percent annually from 1957-1985 and by 0.84 percent&#13;
from 1975-1985. Growth was slightly faster in the later 1980s, helped by the elimination of non-tariff&#13;
barriers on pumps and power tillers, by lower input tariffs which further promoted irrigation, and by the&#13;
continued shift from local to modem rice varieties. Per capita food grain supply rose by about 6 percent&#13;
from 1983 through 1993 and real rice prices fell steadily from 1983 to the end of 1992. Though rice&#13;
remains the dominant crop by far, agriculture has become more diverse, as raw jute fell from 43 percent to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
31 pernt of agricultural exports from 1984-86 to 1990-92, and as the share of crops in total agricultural&#13;
output dropped from about 82 percent to 62 percent.&#13;
1.6    Growth's effect on poverty. The limited recent gains in output and productivity have not&#13;
significantly boosted wages or reduced poverty and malnutrition in rural areas. The index of agricultural&#13;
wages (1973/74 = 100) was 94 in 1983/84, rose to an average of 105 in 1986/1988 and fell again to 94 in&#13;
1993/94. About half of the population remains poor and poverty is most severe in farming areas.&#13;
Malnutrition afflicts two-thirds of children under the age of five.&#13;
B. Crops, Livestock, Fisheries, and Forestry&#13;
1.7    Crops. Crops constitute roughly two thirds of agricultural income and foodgrains provide nearly&#13;
80 percent of the value of crop production. Rice is the major crop, accounting for nearly 80 percent of&#13;
cropped area and 75 percent of the gross value of crop output.&#13;
(a)    Cereals. Farming is organized by three seasonal rice crops: the aman or monsoon crop&#13;
(June through November), the boro (December through April) or dry season crop and the&#13;
aus (March/April through June/July) or spring interseasonal crop. The introduction of high&#13;
yielding varieties, particularly for rice and wheat, the shift to small-scale irrigation and to&#13;
dry season irrigation, plus the expansion of rural infratructure and population pressure&#13;
have changed cropping system in recent years. Boro rice has greatly expanded with&#13;
irrigation, transplanted aman has replaced broadcast aman in better-drained areas, and&#13;
wheat and boro rice have replaced dry season pulses and oilseeds. Wheat area expanded&#13;
from about 40,000 ha in the mid-1960s to over half a million ha in the early 1980s;&#13;
production has increased seven-fold after 1975.&#13;
(b)   Industrial crops. Industrial crops, including spices, contribute nearly 10 percent of the&#13;
gross value of crop production. Jute is the leader, occupying about six percent of arable&#13;
land, though its sown area fell from 840,000 ha in 1984/85-1986/87 to 520,000 ha in&#13;
1991/92-1993/94 because it became less profitable. Production fluctuates widely in&#13;
response to world prices. Average yields are low and depend upon the onset of the rains&#13;
and the ability of the farmer to carry out timely land preparation and sowing. Jute&#13;
cultivation may also be moving to marginal lands, particularly those subject to rapid&#13;
flooding. Sugarcane is the second industrial crop with about 185,000 ha. Yields have&#13;
declined for lack of improved varieties, low sugar recovery, and slow adoption of&#13;
technology by farmers.&#13;
(c)    Other crops. The share of gross value of production of these crops (pulses, oilseeds,&#13;
spices, tea, sugarcane, fruits, and vegetables) is less than 5 percent. The area occupied&#13;
was nearly constant at some 2.0 million ha from 1984/85 to 1993/94. Growth in pulses&#13;
and oilseeds has been nil and some crops have regressed under competition from higher-&#13;
yielding foodgrains. The area and output of vegetables and fruits (eggplant, tomato,&#13;
mangos, papaya, jackfruit, pineapples and bananas) also remained constant in that period.&#13;
For these crops to regain their domestic comparative advantage, more productive&#13;
technologies are needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
(d)   Constraints to Diversification out of Rice. The high dependence on rice for income and&#13;
employment has engendered concems that it disregards growth opportnities in other farm&#13;
goods and that it is too risky. Bank sector work (World Bank, Report 14315-BD) has&#13;
identified barriers to diversification out of rice, including policy distortions, incomplete&#13;
market infrastructure, and lack of research and extension for novel crops. Specific issues&#13;
within the latter area were inappropriate research for intensified agriculture, inadequate&#13;
research on integrated pest management (IPM), and a public research portfolio that&#13;
focused too narrowly on rice and wheat. The report specifically recommended developing&#13;
intensive irrigated production technologies for maize, sunflower, fruits, and vegetables,&#13;
through participatory research and extension designed to better incorporate farmers' needs&#13;
into the research process; the proposed operation would seek to assist with the generation&#13;
of such technologies and to develop a mechanism to develop new research projects that&#13;
respond to farmers in an economically efficient manner (para. 3.16 and Annex 3).&#13;
1.8    Livestock. Animal production provides roughly 11 percent of agricultural GDP. There are about&#13;
23 million cattle, or about 2.8 head per ha of cultivated land, another 30 million sheep and goats, and&#13;
uncounted millions of poultry. Cattle are crucial to the farm economy because they are the major source of&#13;
draft power for cultivation and transport and an important source of cash income; the same is true, to a&#13;
lesser extent of buffalo. About 90 percent of rural families are involved in backyard livestock production,&#13;
where goats, sheep and poultry scavenge on crop residues and household waste. Smallholders and the&#13;
landless hold 40 percent of the national cattle herd, especially goats and poultry, maling livestock an&#13;
important subsector for the rural poor.&#13;
1.9    Livestock performance is poor because of scarce feed, diseases, and inadequate support services&#13;
including research. There is little specialized commercial livestock production, except in peri-urban areas,&#13;
and management is generally unskilled. Scarce feed is a costly constraint to ruminant production; most&#13;
cattle subsist on common rice straw, supplemented only by meager roadside grazing and small quantities of&#13;
bran and oil cake, and there is almost no specialized forage production. Because of poor nutrition at the end&#13;
of the dry season, draft animals are ill-prepared for heavy land preparation, resulting in late cultivation&#13;
which adversely affects crop yields.&#13;
1.10   Fisheries. Fisheries of all types contribute some 13 percent of agricultural GDP. Bangladesh is&#13;
suited for fisheries because it is a deltaic country of rivers, estuaries, ponds and lakes, and has a coastline&#13;
of nearly 500 km. Permanent inland waters cover an estimated 1.4 million ha. Another 3 million ha are&#13;
inundated for almost six months each year. Fisheries are accordingly important for nutrition, income and&#13;
exports. Fish provide over 80 percent of the animal protein in the human diet, although this has declined&#13;
from 33 grams/head/day in 1962 to about 20 grams/head/day in 1990. There are some 1.25 million&#13;
commercial fishermen and over 11 million families derive some income from fishing.&#13;
1.11   About 80 percent of-total fish production comes from capture fisheries (51 percent inland and 28&#13;
percent marine) and the balance mainly from inland culture. There has been rapid growth in culture&#13;
fisheries. During the 1986-90 period, marine culture yields were reported to have increased by one-fourth.&#13;
Shrimp cultivation in brackish water is expanding rapidly and shrimp exports now account for over 80&#13;
percent of fisheries exports. Shrimp yields are low, about 200 kg/ha/year, and very variable (100 -&#13;
2,000 kg/ha) but seemingly could be improved by simple improvements in methods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
1.12   The fisheries sub-sector faces several constraints. Though increases in production can be expected&#13;
from improvements in capture technology, population growth, associated overfishing and low investnent m&#13;
open-access fisheries have resulted in declining freshwater capture fishing from the levels of the late 1980s;&#13;
a Bank-supported Tbird Fisheries Project is assisting with institutional and technical changes to improve&#13;
freshwater capture fisheries and the proposed operation supports research on riverine and other freshwater&#13;
capture fisheries, to be undertaken by the Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (FRI) to resolve the&#13;
technical problems. Despite the very rapid growth in culture fisheries, there are problems of soil and water&#13;
quality due to salinization, overexploitation of spawning grounds, and shortage of shnmp seed; the&#13;
proposed operation supports research on brackish and marine culture fisheries on priority themes (para.&#13;
3.35).&#13;
1.13   Forestry. Forestry contributes about 10 percent of agricultural GDP. The three principal forestry&#13;
systems cover about 3.0 million ha: the hill tracts of Chittagong, the tidal forests of the Sundarban in the&#13;
southwest, and homestead forestry throughout the country. Nearly 2.0 million ha of natural forests survive&#13;
in the hill tracts of Chittagong and the Sundarbans. Though the government owns about 2.0 million ha of&#13;
natural forests and planta ions, more than 75 percent of fuelwood and industrial wood comes from&#13;
privately-owned woodlots and homesteads.&#13;
1.14   Some public forest resources, particularly in the hill tracts, have been declining because of crop&#13;
encroachment, illegal felling and uncontrolled utilization. Private resources have come under increasing&#13;
pressure from population growth and rising incomes and the real price of fuelwood has nsen. Some&#13;
changes have been brought about under the IDA-supported Forest Resources Management Project (Cr.&#13;
2397-BD). New forest management plans have been prepared and community forestry is being introduced&#13;
with assistance from NGOs. With help from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Forest Department is&#13;
now implementing a community/private sector forestry program focusing on the homestead. The proposed&#13;
operation would assist in rehabilitating the research capacity of the Bangladesh Forestry Research Institute&#13;
(BFRI), particularly for the hill and homestead areas, where important research questions remain and&#13;
where growth potential is good.&#13;
C. Agricultural Policies&#13;
1.15   Policy Objectives. The main policy objectives are to stimulate growth enough to pull up rural&#13;
incomes and to cut poverty, and to improve food security. Tbree broad instruments are employed to achieve&#13;
those objectives. The first is the continued liberalization and deregulation of the economy, which is intended&#13;
to better the business climate for the private sector and thereby to improve economic growth. The second is&#13;
targeted intervention for poverty alleviation, such as food for work, vulnerable group development, and&#13;
directed credit. The third is public investment in human capital, physical infrastructure (including roads,&#13;
markets, irrigation, drainage, flood control) and technical change through research and extension.&#13;
1.16   The recent policy regime has been comparatively neutral. There are now few quantitative&#13;
restrictions on international trade in farm goods. Many government regulations on domestic food trade have&#13;
been eliminated. The prices of the major goods are closely aligned to world market prices; for example, the&#13;
long-term nominal protection coefficient of urea, the main fertilizer input, is 0.9, while the domestic price&#13;
of rice has recently fallen between the fob and CIF prices, according to the size of the domestic harvest.&#13;
Bank sector work on diversification (World Bank, Report 14315-BD) has recommended changes in&#13;
policies to eliminate remaining distortions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.17   Water resources strategy. Extensive studies for a national Flood Action Plan have been&#13;
completed. The Government is now preparing a water resources strategy based on those studies. TM&#13;
strategy will emphasize economically and environmentally sound and sustainable investnents, both non-&#13;
structural and structural. The measures taken under the proposed operation are fully consistent with the&#13;
water resources strategy in that they would assist in generating technology to raise productivity in irrigated&#13;
and drained areas.&#13;
2. AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH&#13;
2.1    The independent Government began to develop research in 1973 by creating institutions to support&#13;
studies on commodities or agricultural disciplines. The national agricultural research system (NARS),&#13;
comprising ten Agricultural Research Institutes (ARls) and the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council&#13;
(BARC), now employs about 1370 scientists.&#13;
2.2    The chief organizaeons in the NARS are':&#13;
(a)    BARC, the apex organization responsible for research policy and national coordination;&#13;
(b)    Bangladesh Agricultural Research Insitute (BARI);&#13;
(c)    Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI);&#13;
(d)    Fisheries Research Institute (FRI);&#13;
(e)    Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute (BLRI);&#13;
(f)    Bangladesh Forestry Research Institute (BFRI);&#13;
(g)    Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture (BINA);&#13;
(h)    Bangladesh Soils Research and Development Institute (SRDI);&#13;
(i)    Cotton Development Board (CDB);&#13;
()    Bangladesh Tea Research Institute (BTRI);&#13;
(k)    Bangladesh Jute Research Institute (BJRI); and&#13;
()    Sugarcane Research Institute (SRI).&#13;
BINA, CDB, and SRDI are not participating directly in the proposed operton, but cam compete for cntact research&#13;
grants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
A. Agricultural Research Strategy&#13;
2.3    BARC in collaboration with the ARIs and other national institutions has prepared an agricultural&#13;
research strategy 2, The strategy sets goals for the NARS and operational plans in the ARIs to achieve&#13;
them. The basic goal of the Bangladesh NARS is to 'improve the well-being of present and future&#13;
generations of farmers and consumers in Bangladesh, particularly those with low incomes." Specific&#13;
objectives are to generate technologies and information for crops, livestock, fisheries, and forestry that are&#13;
of economic benefit and that enhance productivity. The essential steps of the research strategy are:&#13;
(a) reorientation of research into profitable, relevant and sustainable programs; (b) establishment of the&#13;
farm unit as the research nexus; (c) improvement of research management to emphasize sound planning and&#13;
human resource development; and (d) improvement of client (farmner, extension worker, and consumer)&#13;
focus in defining priorities and evaluating research products. The strategy was discussed with IDA at&#13;
appraisal and found satisfactory.&#13;
2.4         The strategy s an important step, but it does not sufficiently address governance, scientific&#13;
incentives, performance evaluation and accountability, and stakeholder participation in the research system.&#13;
To implernent the strategy more effectively, the Government agreed at negotiations to carry out a Policy&#13;
Reform Program, consisting of: (a) a policy statement (Annex 8), derived from the agreed strategy and&#13;
acceptable to IDA, declaring its intention to confer greater autonomy upon the ARIs in the areas of budget,&#13;
personnel, and management (para. 4.2(a)); and (b) a plan of actions to confer greater autonomy to the&#13;
ARIs, thereby allowing them to manage resources more flexibly and efficiently (para. 4.1 (a)).&#13;
2.5    ARIs prepare their five-year master plans and annual programs within the strategic framework&#13;
built by BARC. These master plans provide a summary of current and proposed institute research and&#13;
training programs, together with an assessment of additional facilities and resources needed. However,&#13;
they are very general, only partially prioritize future research programs, and do not relate priority research&#13;
programs to quantified constraints or problems. There is also no correlation of proposed programs with&#13;
existing or required resources and facilities, other than an estimate of total anticipated operational&#13;
expenses. Under the proposed operation, the Government agreed to a series of steps for research priority&#13;
definition and program evaluation (para. 3.16) that would sharpen their quantitative focus, improve client&#13;
orientation, and justify resource requirements in terms of the agreed priorities. The Government agreed to&#13;
complete ARI Master Plans by December 31, 1996 and to have them reviewed and accepted by the&#13;
Association (para. 4.1 (b)).&#13;
B. The Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council&#13;
2.6    The GOB established BARC in 1973 to set priorities, coordinate the ARIs, evaluate programs and&#13;
investments, and prepare staff development programs and national research plans. BARC consists of a&#13;
Governing Council and the Secretariat. The Governing Council is headed alternatively by the Ministers&#13;
for Agriculture and Fisheries and Livestock. The Council has 28 members selected from the civil service,&#13;
Directors of Research Institutes, University Vice Chancellors and senior scientists.&#13;
2      Strategic Plan for National Agricultural Research System to the Year 2010 and Bevond Bangladesh Agricultural&#13;
Research Council in Association with NARS Institutions, Dhaka, Bangladesh, March, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
2.7    The BARC Secretariat is headed by an Executive Vice-Chairman. It comprises nine divisions&#13;
headed by Member-Directors and departments headed by Directors. The Member Directors and Directors&#13;
evaluate research proposals and coordinate contract research. The Secretariat has specialized technical&#13;
committees that advise on research proposals in field, industrial, and horticultural crops, soils and&#13;
irrigation, agronomy, forestry, livestock, fisheries, agricultural engineering, nutrition and home sciences,&#13;
and agricultural economics and social sciences. A Finance Committee prepares the annual budget and&#13;
examines financial proposals for research.&#13;
2.8    BARC has been partally successful in carrying out its mandate.  BARC wrote a National&#13;
Agricultural Research Plan  in the early 1980s and again in 1990/913. Those documents were the&#13;
foundation of the 1992/93 five-year master plans of each ARI, used as the basis of their annual programs.&#13;
The Secretariat has played a major role in developing contract research, allocating funds for ad hoc&#13;
research activities, and in arranging overseas postgraduate fellowships for scientists.&#13;
2.9    BARC's basic problem has been that it is an agency of the MOA but is responsible for the ARIs of&#13;
three other ministries. In 4he case of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) Istitutes and BFRI, BARC&#13;
nominally evaluates and approves research proposals before they are submitted to the MOA for funding.&#13;
Because the Boards of Govemors of ARTs have composition and status similar to BARC, some ARTs,&#13;
notably FRI and BLRI, ignore BARC's recommendations. Most Institutes do not maintain close contact&#13;
with the BARC Secretariat, and BARC consequently has been unable to monitor, evaluate and coordinate&#13;
their research projects and programs nationally, even though it has prepared a series of strategic/national&#13;
plans for agricultural research.&#13;
2.10 For BARC to be effective, its role must be acknowledged in its ordinance as well as in those of the&#13;
ARIs and its powers must be strengthened. The Govermnent has recently promulgated a revised BARC&#13;
Ordinance, expanding its authority in research management. As a condition of effectiveness, BARC would&#13;
issue executive orders, acceptable to IDA, mandating research proposal preparation and evaluation rules&#13;
and procedures beginning July 1, 1996 (para. 4.2(c)).&#13;
C. The Agricultural Research Institutes&#13;
2.11   The ARIs belong to separate ministries, who approve their plans and budgets: FRI and BLRI to the&#13;
Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock (MOFL), BFRI to the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF),&#13;
and the others to the MOA. All operate under ordinances that give them limited autonomy, except for SRI&#13;
and BFRI, which are government departments. Each institute has separate facilities, staff, program and&#13;
budget.&#13;
3     National Agricultural Research Plan 1979-83; National Agriculbual Research Plan 1984-89; and Strategic Plan for&#13;
National Agricultural Research to the Year 2010 and Beyond, BARC, March 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
1. Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute&#13;
2.12   BARI became semiautonomous in 1976. It is responsible for research on all crops other than those&#13;
covered by specialized institutes (rice, tea, sugarcane, cotton, and jute). A Director is assisted by three&#13;
Associate Directors, who administer some 800 scientific staff in nine divisions. In addition to the Central&#13;
Station at Gazipur, near Dhaka, BARI has 22 regional stations and substations covering 8 to 200 ha.&#13;
These stations are staffed by over 300 scientists in different agro-ecological zones. When fully operational&#13;
this station network will enable experiments with regard to regional climate differences; under the proposed&#13;
operation, funds would be provided to make the network of stations fully operational (para. 3.31).&#13;
2.13   BARI's mandate is to increase and stabilize crop production through scientific study of land,&#13;
water, fertilizers, pests, and diseases; crop varieties; improved cropping systems; tools and machines;&#13;
taining of research and extension staff, relevant publications; and collaboration with other research&#13;
centers, both domestic and foreign. Crop variety research includes the cereals (wheat, maize, barley, and&#13;
the millets); oilseeds, pulses, tuber crops, fruits, vegetables, spices, and palms and nuts. There is also&#13;
significant work on crop husbandry (including irrigation practices), soil-plant nutrient management, pest&#13;
and disease management, economics and farming systems, conservation of genetic resources, and post-&#13;
harvest technology. BARI scientists have developed improved cultivars of wheat. Since the mid-1980s,&#13;
they have propagated others in pulses, spices, vegetables, jute and sugarcane. They have advanced in crop&#13;
agronomy, leading to better water and fertilizer use and better planting techniques for wheat, maize,&#13;
oilcrops, pulses, vegetables, spices and fruit.&#13;
2.14 BARC recently evaluated BARI. It observed that BARI tends to study too many crops each with&#13;
m any objectives and constaints. The 1990-95 program, with over 200 projects, might need to concentrate&#13;
on fewer commodities with high potential. More interactions between the disciplinary scientists and the&#13;
commodity scientists are needed in order to avoid duplications of efforts and ensure complementarity. The&#13;
review concluded that BARI's program sometimes lacks focus, little interaction exists between its&#13;
disciplinary divisions and its commodity scientists, and found duplication within BARI and between other&#13;
crop research institutes. The evaluation report recommended that BARI operations be rationalized; this&#13;
and other recommendations would be implemented under the proposed project (para. 3.30).&#13;
2. Bangladesh Rice Research Institute&#13;
2.15   BRRI was established in 1970 as the first crop research institute in Bangladesh. BRRI, with a&#13;
Board of Governors headed by the Minister of Agriculture, now has about 200 scientists and 8 regional&#13;
stations. Aided by continuing technical support from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), and&#13;
funding from external agencies, especially for training personnel and developing the Joydevpur site, BRRI&#13;
is a fully viable institution that has made a significant contribution to Bangladeshi agriculture. BRRI&#13;
varieties are used in 60-70 percent of the rice area, including the entire boro crop.&#13;
2.16   The impact of technical change generated by BRRI varieties has lately stagnated. Total factor&#13;
productivity has grown only slightly in recent years and some of this is obviously due to lagging&#13;
productivity growth in rice. The yields of HYV rices have not increased in the past 15 years; the only&#13;
growth in rice yields has come from the shift of local rice varieties to HYVs, not from rising yields in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
latter, and from more fertilizer and irrigation. Despite BRRI's achievements, its recognized potential to do&#13;
more, and the apparent underfunding of rice research in Bangladesh, the institution suffers from several&#13;
systemic problems, which are reflected in the recent departure of many senior scientific staff. Significant&#13;
reforms in BRRI are needed to strengthen the impact of research on the country's most important crop.&#13;
Future research not only must continue breeding improved varieties but must place more emphasis on&#13;
production technologies, including integrated pest management, the stagnation of HYV yields in rice&#13;
monoculture and the sustainability of rice-wheat rotations. Under the proposed operation, BRRI's research,&#13;
like that of the other ARIs, would be redirected with a stronger client focus, priorities would be set with a&#13;
more efficient economic orientation, and eventual full autonomy would allow better management of&#13;
personnel and physical assets (para. 3.27).&#13;
3. Bangladesh Jute Research Institute&#13;
2.17   BJRI was established in 1951, building on a long history of jute research in the sub-continent, and&#13;
now has semiautonomous status in the Ministry of Agriculture. It is organized in two Directorates, dealing&#13;
with agriculture and processing technology. BJRI has four regional stations and three substations, with&#13;
about 100 scientists of whom 16 have the PhD.&#13;
2.18   Achievements have  been to develop improved varieties of jute, which are in wide use in&#13;
Bangladesh; to develop better tossa jute varieties with shorter field duration and photosensitivity, and&#13;
greater disease resistance; to insert jute into multiple cropping systems with rice through improved&#13;
cropping practices; to recommend improved fertilizer management and better retting practices.&#13;
2.19   The general direction of BJRI research is appropriate. Its Agriculture Wing concentrates on&#13;
breeding better varieties with higher yields, better fiber quality, shorter duration, pest resistance, and&#13;
adaptability to different agro-ecological conditions including saline and marginal lands. Its Technology&#13;
Wing focuses on processing; improvements of textiles, dyeing and printing of jute yarn and fabrics; and&#13;
development of new uses for jute fiber. Under the proposed operation, more emphasis would be given to&#13;
developing improved production practices for marginal lands, reducing the cost of production; and, in&#13;
collaboration with BFRI, developing jute for paper pulp (para. 3.32).&#13;
4. Sugarcane Research Institute&#13;
2.20   The Bangladesh Sugar Mills Corporation and Bangladesh Sugar Foods Industrial Corporation&#13;
established a Sugarcane Research Institute in 1973 which was essentially run by and for the sugar industry&#13;
(public sugar mills), with close collaboration with BARI. Responsibility was added for in-service training&#13;
for field technicians of the sugar mills and four field stations were established in addition to the earlier&#13;
established regional research station. Research was only conducted in sugar mill areas. Finally, in 1989&#13;
the SRI became a government department of the MOA, and now has about 90 scientists.&#13;
2.21   For the future, the SRI must clearly accept responsibility for research in both mill and nonmill&#13;
areas, the latter of which occupies the majority of sugarcane land. Under the proposed project, with limited&#13;
additional support, SRI would develop a more focused program of varietal diversification and improvement&#13;
for sugar and gur (molasses) production and chewing cane, development of cultural practices which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
optimize planting techniques, fertilizer use and water management, and identify optimum intercropping&#13;
strategies (para. 3.34).&#13;
5. Fisheries Research Institute&#13;
2.22    FRI, established in 1984 as an semiautonomous institution under the MOFL, has the chief&#13;
responsibility of fisheries research. FRI has about 80 scientists, in addition to others conducting fish&#13;
research at BAU, and the Universities at Dhaka, Chittagong and Rajshahi. FRI research has four chief&#13;
areas: (a) freshwater research at Mymensingh (also the headquarters of FRI); (b) riverine research at&#13;
Chandpur and Rangamnati; (c) marine fisheries at Cox's Bazaar; and (d) brackish water research at&#13;
Paikgacha. Its activities focused initially on establishing its physical facilities and developing scientific&#13;
staff. Research has achieved results on genetic improvement of carp, surveys of fish diseases, culture&#13;
techniques for fry and fingerlings, seasonal pond management practices, fish polyculture in inland culture&#13;
fisheries, and improved methods of fish nutrition.&#13;
2.23   During project preparation, IDA accepted a proposal to restructure FRI away from a project to a&#13;
program approach in line with set priorities, to separate management from daily administration of facilities,&#13;
and to create multidisciplinary groups. The key features of the agreed new structure are: (a) at headquarters&#13;
in Mymensingh, the creation of a new post of Additional Director, Administration and Finance, who will&#13;
lead all administrative functions under one department (the current Additional Director post will continue to&#13;
lead the Research Department); (b) at the freshwater station in Mymensingh, the new structure will reflect&#13;
emphasis on socioeconomic, famiing system, and environmental aspects, and on developing culture&#13;
fisheries; (c) at the riverine station at Chandpur, the restructuring will reflect the focus on providing&#13;
technology on problems surrounding open access, open water capture fisheries in a highly changing aquatic&#13;
environment; and (d) at the brackish water station in Paikgacha, merging shellfish and fish under one&#13;
division and creating three new divisions (estuarine ecology and environment, soil, water and productivity&#13;
management, and aquaculture engineering). Under the proposed operation, additional support would be&#13;
provided to complete FRm's facilities and to upgrade scientific skills at the four chief research sites (para.&#13;
3.35).&#13;
6. Bangladesh Forest Research Institute&#13;
2.24        Forestry research has been the exclusive responsibility of BFRI since its foundation in 1955&#13;
under the Forest Department. In 1985 BFRI became attached to the Ministry of Agriculture and in 1989 to&#13;
the then established Ministry of Environment and Forestry. BFRI, unlike most ARIs does not have partial&#13;
autonomy and remains a government department. It now operates from a headquarters in Chittagong with&#13;
22 field stations around the country.&#13;
2.25       BFRI has some notable achievements. Its scientists have devised means of vegetatively&#13;
propagating bamboo, a vital species for homestead forestry, and of protecting it against pests. They have&#13;
also screened many tree species for suitability, developed a solar kiln for seasoning timber, improved the&#13;
technique for jute pulping, and prepared a guide for siting appropriate tree species.&#13;
2.26       BFRI confronts some severe difficulties. The current scientific staff number is 64 with only&#13;
10 having the PhD. The physical plant needs urgent refurbishing as BFRI is one of the oldest research&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
institutes. It has few new laboratory, office or domestic facilities, virtually no transport or computing&#13;
equipment, and much of its equipment is quite old. Its activities are based on a project approach&#13;
comprising a series of disconnected activities not fully focusing on key constraints. Under the proposed&#13;
operation, BFRI's facilities would be rehabilitated, additional training would be given to staff and&#13;
management improvements would be introduced, including a greater focus on ex-ante review of research&#13;
projects (para. 3.38).&#13;
7. Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute&#13;
2.27   BLRI was established in 1984 with the main objective of raising the productivity of indigenous&#13;
ruminants and non-ruminants. After initial establishment of facilities and staff, BLRI now has five research&#13;
divisions: Poultry Production; Animal Production; Animal Health; Systems Research and Socioeconomic&#13;
Research, supported by an Administrative Division and a Research Planning Cell. There are some 43&#13;
scientists and about 75 support staff. BLRI has suffered from repeated tumover in management and lack of&#13;
focus in the scientific pro-ram. During project preparation, it was observed that BLRI needed to be&#13;
restructured along five key program areas and a restructuring proposal acceptable to IDA was agreed at&#13;
appraisal.&#13;
2.28   Livestock research has been fragmented, based on little knowledge of fanming systems, poorly&#13;
related to local problems, and has lacked an economic perspective. About half of the 320 studies carried&#13;
out in the last 20 years have been in veterinary medicine; the others covered mostly academic aspects of&#13;
animal production and were sometimes not fully relevant in farmers' conditions. Institutional performance&#13;
has accordingly been poor and of little benefit to farmers. The project would provide for improving the&#13;
focus of livestock research from the existing project approach, where it has been mainly based on a series&#13;
of several disconnected projects, to a more focused and coherent program approach releasing key sectoral&#13;
constraints. Under the proposed operation, BLRI's research would focus on issues of greater importance&#13;
for producers, especially the economics of livestock production, animal nutrition and forage production;&#13;
management improvements would be introduced, and facilities would be upgraded or completed in priority&#13;
areas (para. 3.40).&#13;
D. Barriers to Better Research&#13;
2.29   Scientists have not always produced new and profitable technologies that respond to the high&#13;
variability in national farming systems--soils, water, land forms, biotic and abiotic stresses, farmers'&#13;
circumstances, and changing prices. The main barriers to better research are inadequate and unstable&#13;
funding, weak research planning, insufficient client orientation, inadequate scientific incentives,&#13;
institutional isolation, the ineffectiveness of BARC, incomplete financial management capacity, and&#13;
duplication of research activities across ARIs.&#13;
2.30   Inadequate and Unstable Funding. Total capital and operating research expenditures were&#13;
Tk 872 million in 1988/89, Tk 1,426 million in 1990/91 and Tk 1,102 million in 1992/93. The year&#13;
1990/91 corresponded with high capital spending at BARC and BARI, who each received on average about&#13;
30 to 35 percent of the total. BARC's share is now about 20 percent, while BARI's has risen to 40 percent.&#13;
The system average for 1988/89 through 1992/93 was 0.4 percent of agricultural GDP, a share which is&#13;
low by international standards and by the standards of Bangladesh's regional competitors in agricultural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
markets. Spending may even decline in the near future, because USAID, previously a major donor, stopped&#13;
funding the Bangladesh NARS in 1994.&#13;
2.31   Funding has also been unstable and of inappropriate composition, partly because of its sources.&#13;
For 1991/92, GOB revenue funds accounted for 30-35 percent and development funds for 65-70 percent of&#13;
recurrent expenditures. The development budget is typically 60 percent external funds and 40 percent GOB&#13;
funds. Donors provide virtually all capital expenditures and most non-salary operational costs. The&#13;
dependence on external funds causes uncertainty for BARC, BRRI, BLRI and BFRI, whose personnel&#13;
costs are entirely paid through the development budget. When donor funding ceases, very little is left for&#13;
operation and maintenance (O&amp;M). There are three direct consequences of this low level of GOB funding&#13;
of operational costs: first is the interruption of work when external funding ceases; second is the&#13;
underutilization of fixed assets resources (principal staff, land, ponds, nurseries); and third is the chronic&#13;
dilapidation of facilities.&#13;
2.32   The proposed operation would provide both immediate and longer-term solutions to the funding&#13;
problems. First, it gives funds for capital: construction of new facilities and rehabilitation of old ones; for&#13;
laboratory and other scientific equipment; for computing equipment and software, which are now very&#13;
scarce; and for vehicles. Second, the project provides adequate operating costs (including funds for a small&#13;
number of new scientists in the newer ARIs) so that the existing and additional capital stock can be fully&#13;
used. Third, during preparation, the GOB transferred scientific personnel costs from the development&#13;
budget to the revenue budget, thus making funding more stable and assured. Fourth, during implementation&#13;
the GOB has agreed to define the necessary legal and administrative steps to make the ARIs more&#13;
autonomous, so that they can manage resources and respond to client needs more flexibly (para. 4.1 (a)).&#13;
Fifth, the GOB has carry out a study of private financing of research, including that from producers'&#13;
organizations, so as to broaden the financing base of research (para. 2.42). Lastly, supervision of the&#13;
operation will specifically monitor total project funding, and funding for each of its executing agencies, and&#13;
discuss needed corrective measures with the Government during implementation (Annex 5, Table A.5.2).&#13;
2.33   Weak Research Planning. Planning at BARC or in the ARIs does not rank researchable problems&#13;
in terms of economic benefits or other relevant criteria. A study by the International Service for National&#13;
Agricultural Research (ISNAR) and the NARS derived measures of priorities, in terms of economic&#13;
benefits to research, income, and nutrition, but the NARS has not acted upon the results4. Other defects in&#13;
planning include: (a) lack of sustained institutional analytical capacity to undertake continuous priority-&#13;
setting; (b) inadequate participation of biological scientists, who have too often viewed priority setting as&#13;
an "economist's exercise'" (c) excessive focus on resource allocation across commodities, with little effort&#13;
to estimate expected costs and benefits of individual projects; (d) inadequate tools to track resource use, so&#13;
that there has been no monitoring of the implementation of the work; and (e) not enough formal ex-post&#13;
evaluation leading, for example, to closure of unsuccessful ventures or to expansion of successful ones.&#13;
Scientists therefore work without clear direction about the benefits of their work and how it is evaluated.&#13;
Under the proposed operation, the Government would analyze proposed research projects in terms of net&#13;
economic benefits and take other measures to strengthen research planning (para. 3.16 ).&#13;
2.34   Insufficient Client Orientation. Client orientation has two broad aspects: relations between&#13;
scientists and the agents of technology transfer (mainly extension workers, whether public, private, or&#13;
social); and relations among scientists, extension workers, and farmers, where the latter include commercial&#13;
4Norton, George, R. E. Witters and Mohdan Dey. Bangladesh Research Priorities Study. ISNAR/BARC. 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
and subsistence producers. Inadequate information exchange among scientists, extensionists and policy-&#13;
makers mean that research recommendations do not always reach farmers, or that they are not adopted for&#13;
lack of inputs. With the exception of irregular attendance of research scientists at monthly district technical&#13;
committee meetings, there is incomplete liaison between research and extension. The situation is to some&#13;
extent exacerbated by the tendency of farming systems research (FSR) units of the various research&#13;
institutes and the National Coordinated FSR Program to develop their own technology transfer activities in&#13;
preference to working through the extension service and non-goverrnental organizations (NGOs).&#13;
2.35   ARI work is mainly on research stations. Developed technologies, as a result, have sometimes not&#13;
been adaptable to farming systems in the different AEZs. A FSR program designed to carry out adaptive&#13;
research in farmers' fields, mainly for testing and verifying the adaptability of on-station research to&#13;
farmers' conditions, was initiated at BARI in 1979, and in 1985 it was expanded to cover other ARIs with&#13;
BARC providing the overall design and coordination. In addition to verifying key technologies, such as the&#13;
adaptability of rice and wheat varieties, FSR has created awareness among commodity researchers and&#13;
extension staff for the need to have technologies fit well within farming systems. The program has been&#13;
constrained with insufficient prioritization, poor management and inadequate skill mix of the&#13;
interdisciplinary working groups, lack of continuity of financial support, and insufficient links with&#13;
extension and NGOs. The proposed operation has a participatory FSR component to assist in resolving&#13;
those problems (para. 3.41).&#13;
2.36   Inadequate Scientific Incentives. Motivation and retention of scientific staff is the crucial&#13;
incentive question. The civil service does not reward outstanding scientific work or sanction bad&#13;
performance. The ARIs cannot sufficiently control appointments, transfers, promotions, and compensation.&#13;
Personnel changes depend on seniority, not on merit . Evaluation is not sufficiently linked to performance&#13;
targets and job descriptions. The proposed operation would facilitate a shift to autonomy for the research&#13;
institutes that would allow them to recruit, retain, compensate, and manage highly-skilled scientists more&#13;
efficiently than is possible under current civil service rules (para. 2.4). Existing staff rules would be&#13;
revised to ensure uniformity across NARS in control of appointments and promotions by NARS;&#13;
promotion on merit against seniority; and transparent performance evaluation, based on lucid job&#13;
descriptions.&#13;
2.37   Isolated Institutions. An impediment to productivity is the bureaucratic isolation of the ARIs.&#13;
This is most striking where livestock and fisheries have been divorced from crops research, even in such&#13;
naturally integrated areas as shrimp-rice farming or using animals for cultivation; moreover, individual&#13;
crops such as rice, jute, sugarcane, and cotton are often studied in isolation because that is the way the&#13;
ARIs are organized. The result has been a lagging supply of technologies to fit into the varied farming&#13;
systems across the AEZs. The proposed operation would specifically allocate money for joint initiatives&#13;
among ARIs, and other institutions, to produce integrated studies on issues of collective interest (para.&#13;
3.24). The agreed guidelines for research project generation and approval (Annex 3) would harmonize the&#13;
approach to priority setting across the ARIs, and encourage them to work together on common issues.&#13;
2.38   Ineffectiveness of BARC. The BARC Ordinance and the ARIs' Ordinances have sometimes made&#13;
BARC ineffective in exercising its mandate to coordinate research. A core issue is that BARC's mandate&#13;
conflicts with those of the ARIs. BARC's 1988 Ordinance called for it to plan and approve ARIs' research&#13;
programs and to manage and implement research. The mandates of ARIs-including SRI and BFRI, which&#13;
are managed by their respective ministries as government departments--permitted them to manage their&#13;
research programs without BARC's approval. Second, there are multiple governing bodies. The ARls,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
except SRI and BFRI, are managed by governing bodies of the same status as that of BARC's, making it&#13;
more difficult for BARC to exercise its authority. Third, some BARC Member-Directors had too much&#13;
power over ARls. Changes in the Ordinances of BARC, discussed and agreed with IDA during project&#13;
preparation, have already begun to be implemented and would eliminate these conflicts (para. 3.15(a)).&#13;
2.39   There have also been internal reasons for the ineffectiveness of BARC. The BARC Secretariat has&#13;
too many units reporting to the Executive Vice-Chairman (EVC), making management cumbersome. More&#13;
delegation of power is required with fewer units reporting directly to the chief executive. Proposals for&#13;
restructuring the BARC Secretariat were discussed and agreed with IDA during project preparation and&#13;
have begun to be implemented (para. 3.15(b)).&#13;
2.40   Incomplete Financial Management Capacity. The financial systems of BARC and the NARS are&#13;
inadequate. Financial controls achieve their primary purpose of minimizing fraud, but cause unproductive&#13;
delays. Expenditures are not clearly defined by activities or programs. Funding shortfalls, which should&#13;
prune low priority programs and leave high priority ones, affect all equally. ISNAR's assistance to BARC&#13;
in research planning introdr'ed a management information system (MIS) at the BARC Secretariat and the&#13;
ARTs, but the MIS does not have a budgeting and accounting system and ART accounting staff have not&#13;
received training in the MIS. The proposed operation would assist in upgrading the financial capacity of&#13;
the ARIs through technical assistance and by completing the financial module of the MIS throughout the&#13;
NARS (para. 3.20).&#13;
2.41   Research Duplication. There is a lack of coordination among ARIs leading to duplication and&#13;
repetition. Management at some ARTs appears unwilling to stop research projects that repeat work done&#13;
elsewhere or at some earlier time in Bangladesh. Some facilities are duplicated across ARIs, indicating&#13;
some possible gains from consolidation. Resources provided for improved management under the proposed&#13;
operation would strengthen research coordination. The adoption of a system of ex-ante research program&#13;
analysis in the ARIs would also force scientists and managers to allocate resources more strictly with less&#13;
repetition of previous experiments. At negotiations, the Government agreed to: (a) prepare an action plan to&#13;
reduce duplication of research facilities and activities in the ARIs by December 31, 1996; and (b) carry out the&#13;
action plan after receiving IDA's comments on it (para.4. I (c)).&#13;
2.42   No private sector financing of research. There is no private sector research financing though&#13;
good possibilities exist in industrial crops (tea, jute, sugarcane, cotton, maize), fisheries (notably pond&#13;
culture) and forestry. At negotiations, the Government agreed to: (a) terms of reference for a study of&#13;
means of expanding private-sector financing of agricultural research; and (b) furnish the findings and&#13;
recommendations of the study to IDA by December 31, 1996 (para.4.1 (d)). The study will also identify&#13;
options for more vigorous development of producers' organizations.&#13;
2.43   Donor coordination. Many donors support agricultural research in Bangladesh. Coordination&#13;
among them has sometimes been absent, causing duplication of efforts. To improve coordination, it was&#13;
agreed at appraisal that: (a) BARC and ARI research plans would be defined so as not to receive&#13;
overlapping support from multiple donors; and (b) that BARC and the ARIs would review all proposed&#13;
research programs with the same priority-setting procedures that apply throughout the NARS (para.&#13;
3.17).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
3.1    Sustained investment in agricultural research is necessary to raise total factor productivity in&#13;
farming; output growth sufficient to raise incomes of poor producers and the landless cannot be realized by&#13;
additional inputs alone. The justification for sustained public agricultural research is that some of its fruits&#13;
are public goods. Private agents do not have full incentives to invest in such goods because they cannot&#13;
receive the full return to their investment. This incentive failure explains underinvestment in agricultural&#13;
research, as shown by ex-post returns that are often much greater than the opportunity cost of public&#13;
capital. The general justification for public research funding is stronger in Bangladesh where farming&#13;
cannot always be improved with imported techniques, which either do not exist for national conditions or&#13;
need local adaptation before being superior to available techniques. Public subsidies, not full cost recovery&#13;
from producers profiting from research, are also justified because benefits from research and extension&#13;
flow to consumers via long-term commodity price decreases resulting from technical change and because&#13;
the great majority of Bangladeshi producers are too poor to pay for their own research. Either such&#13;
benefits are quickly reflected in the prices of nontradable commodities, or they are seen more gradually in&#13;
declining imports of traded goods, and, eventually, in falling world prices of traded goods as technical&#13;
changes diffuse internationally.&#13;
3.2    The specific rationale for IDA involvement is to assist in the production of public research goods,&#13;
to promote administrative and procedural reforms in the NARS, to assist in making public investment&#13;
more sustainable, and in reorienting investment to more efficient ends. The Government of Bangladesh has&#13;
requested IDA assistance to strengthen national agricultural research and to achieve those goals.&#13;
3.3    The proposed operation is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of November 9,&#13;
1995 (Report No. 14998). The goal of the CAS is poverty alleviation through a dual strategy of: (a) labor-&#13;
intensive growth; and (b) investment in human capital to allow the poor to participate in economic growth.&#13;
In seeking labor-intensive growth to reduce poverty, the CAS emphasizes an employment-based&#13;
agricultural strategy of intensification and reducing the environmental costs of agriculture. The proposed&#13;
project contributes to that strategy by promoting the generation and ultimate adoption of new agricultural&#13;
technologies that intensify land use (i.e., raise yields per unit area), create employment for the landless and&#13;
small fanners, diversify farming into new, more productive enterprises, and protect the environment.&#13;
3.4    The proposed operation contributes to the national objectives of agricultural growth and poverty&#13;
alleviation. It does so by assisting public investment in the human capital, physical infrastructure, and&#13;
institutional reforms needed to better the national agricultural research system and thereby to promote&#13;
technical change in the sector. It further contributes to the environmental sustainability of agriculture by&#13;
targeting research to work in those sub-sectors and production regions, where the environmental costs of&#13;
intensified agriculture might be high in the absence of adequate research to relieve them. The project is not&#13;
part of the program of targeted interventions and has no applicable poverty category.&#13;
B. Lessons of IDA Experience&#13;
3.5    Previous IDA experience in Bangladesh, as well recent agricultural research projects in Asia&#13;
(Indonesia, Paidstan, and India), Africa (Mali and Kenya), and Mexico have been considered in the design&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
of the operation, with respect to government commitment, priority definition, and the role of farming&#13;
systems research in developing linkages among scientists, extension workers and farmers.&#13;
3.6   IDA has supported agricultural development in Bangladesh with more than 25 credits. Increased&#13;
food production has been the main goal of IDA's lending with emphasis on minor irrigation, research and&#13;
extension, flood control and drainage, fisheries, forestry and, recently, support services. IDA-supported&#13;
projects include: Agricultural Support Services (Cr. 2233-BD); National Minor Irrigation Development&#13;
(Cr. 2246-BD); Shallow Tubewell and Low-Lift Pump Irrigation (Cr. 2253-BD); Forest Resources&#13;
Management (Cr. 2397-BD); Third Fisheries Cr. 2146-BD); Shrimp Culture (Cr. 165 1-BD); Bangladesh&#13;
Water Development Board Small Schemes (Cr. 1467-BD); Flood Control and Drainage m and IV (Crs.&#13;
1591-BD and 1784-BD); Small Scale Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation II (Cr. 1870-BD); and&#13;
Bangladesh Water Development Board System Rehabilitation (Cr. 2099-BD).&#13;
3.7   Previous agricultural research operations were Agricultural Research I (ARP-I) and II (ARP-II)&#13;
(Cr. 828-BD of US$6 million in 1978 and Cr. 1455-BD of US$24.5 million in 1985), completed in&#13;
December 31, 1984 and June 30, 1992, respectively. ARP-I strengthened BARC headquarters and three&#13;
BARI regional stations. Funds were provided for contract research on cropping systems, soil and water&#13;
management, agricultural engineering and crop protection, and for training and technical assistance to&#13;
fonnulate and implement inonitonng and evaluation procedures of the Contract Research Scheme. Salient&#13;
research results were the identification of suitable technologies for different cropping patterns, the&#13;
determination of zinc and sulfur deficiencies in rice production, the estimation of crop water responses, and&#13;
staff training. The project built BARC offices in Dhaka, established the BARI stations, implemented&#13;
contract research, began overseas training and developed a national agricultural research plan.&#13;
3.8   The main objectives of ARP-II (Cr. 1455-BD) were to further improve research infrastructure and&#13;
management. Components were strengthening BARC through provision of additional senior staff; offices&#13;
and laboratories, and equipment, machinery and vehicles for field stations for BARI and for BFRI. ARP-II&#13;
achieved much. Two research institutes (FRI and BLRI) were established and BFRI substantially&#13;
developed. Professional and technical training were expanded. BARC's role was strengthened by a new&#13;
ordinance promulgated in 1988. Improved research management procedures were introduced. Much of the&#13;
physical infrastructure envisaged under the project was completed. Many scientists finished postgraduate&#13;
or non-degree training. A land classification, completed in 1988 with assistance from UNDP and FAO,&#13;
provided a better understanding of the potential and constraints of agriculture, and is now used for planning&#13;
research and extension.&#13;
3.9   There were important problems with ARP II, however, that resulted in an OED rating of&#13;
unsatisfactory. Contract research was not fully implemented because approval procedures were costly and&#13;
often supported irrelevant projects. The initial program was funded by GOB and involved 35 subprojects&#13;
and 15 different institutes. Further funds were provided by USAID and from IDA's Agricultural Research&#13;
and Extension and Research Projects. With the exception of some contract funding of research at&#13;
Universities, and the approval of PL 480 releases, the Program operated by BARC - especially&#13;
disbursements under the Second Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 1455-BD) - was not very successful.&#13;
Only about 60 percent of the available contract funds were spent, of which half was to complement current&#13;
research, not to support additional work. Much of the work funded repeated earlier work, little was&#13;
interdisciplinary, and there were long delays in processing requests; the proposed operation has more&#13;
efficient procedures for contract research administration (para. 3.22).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
3.10 Previous research projects were not fully successful in ensuring that research efforts were planned,&#13;
carried out, monitored, and evaluated according to established priorities. The principal lesson of those&#13;
operations is that public agricultural research cannot yield productive and sustainable results without deep&#13;
institutional reforms. Relevant lessons of previous operations, including ARP-I and ARP-II, are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)    BARC requires more autonomy in relation to the ministries, so as to exercise its&#13;
intellectual leadership of the ARIs.&#13;
(b)    BARC must improve its managerial capability, including more efficient procedures for&#13;
contract research and for evaluating research.&#13;
(c)    Research institutes need autonomy to ensure that their programs respond to client needs,&#13;
are scientifically sound, and give staff full incentives for good work.&#13;
(d)    Operating costs should be funded from the revenue budget, thus helping research programs&#13;
to be sustainable after project completion.&#13;
(e)    Financial procedures should be computerized to provide rapid retrieval for management&#13;
decisions.&#13;
(f)    Greater effort is needed to use modem methods of research priority setting, including&#13;
building a consensus among scientists about the validity and utility of those methods.&#13;
3.11   Government Commitment. The proposed project has been jointly designed with the Government&#13;
and takes full account of current constraints and lessons leamt from earlier operations and from economic&#13;
and sector work. The Govemment is aware of the current constraints to a more effective research system&#13;
and is committed to address them; indeed, it has begun key reforms before implementation.&#13;
3.12   Role of FSR in Developing Links Among Research, Extension and Farmers. A key lesson&#13;
from previous operations is that strong links among scientists, extensionists and farmers are crucial for&#13;
productive research and extension. Previous IDA-supported operations have helped to forge such links in&#13;
Bangladesh. The Agricultural Extension and Research projects I and II (Crs. 729-BD and 1215-BD) helped&#13;
the Training and Visit (T&amp;V) extension system through monthly workshops. In such workshops&#13;
researchers train subject matter specialists (SMSs) of the extension staff on new technologies; the SMSs&#13;
then pass them to village extension workers, who communicate them to farmers. Direct contact between&#13;
research scientists and farmers occurs during field visits. With the support of the ongoing Agricultural&#13;
Support Services Project (ASSP - Cr. 2233-BD), the extension service is introducing more democratic&#13;
planning by focusing on farmer groups instead of contact farmers, and expanding the use of mass media,&#13;
field demonstrations and field days. Included is a program to train extension staff, including in-service&#13;
training for higher level professional staff at research institutes. The proposed operation further strengthens&#13;
research-extension-farmer linkages by providing resources to the national FSR program of BARC and to&#13;
the ARI FSR programs (paras. 3.41 through 3.44)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
C. Project Objective and Summary Description&#13;
3.13   The project objective is to increase the efficiency of the national agricultural research system and&#13;
thereby to generate profitable, relevant, and sustainable agricultural technologies for Bangladeshi&#13;
agricultural producers. The project would achieve its objective through: (a) strengthening BARC's&#13;
capacities in research organization and management, including better research resource allocation; (b)&#13;
supporting priority research; and (c) strengthening research linkages to extension through participatory&#13;
fanming systems research.&#13;
3.14   The project has three components, with annual costs shown in Table 1.&#13;
(a)    Research Management and Organization would strengthen research planning and&#13;
managerial capabilities of BARC through carrying out of institutional reforms, improved&#13;
economic analysis of research programs, technical assistance, construction and&#13;
rehabilitation of civil works, training, contract research, and supervision of new master&#13;
plans for participating ARls;&#13;
(b)    Priority Research would be carried out in the ARIs on crops, fisheries, livestock and&#13;
forestry; and&#13;
(c)    Participatory Farming Systems Research would strengthen farming systems research&#13;
programs through support to research-extension linkages and testing and dissemination of&#13;
appropriate technology.&#13;

D. Project Components&#13;
1. Research Organization and Management (USS13.99 million)&#13;
3.15   This component would upgrade research organization and research management at BARC and the&#13;
ARls. It is designed to develop a unified NARS with more efficient resource allocation and more&#13;
transparent relationship among members. It builds upon several institutional reforms that have already&#13;
been completed.&#13;
(a)    Giving stronger authority for BARC in setting research priorities. BARC is now&#13;
responsible for national research planning, coordination, monitoring and evaluation and&#13;
has developed a national agricultural research strategic plan.&#13;
(b)    Simplifying BARC's Secretariat. BARC's Secretariat has been simplified by bringing all&#13;
functional units under the nine divisions, each headed by a Member-Director reporting to&#13;
the Chairman (the several departments that reported directly to the Chief Executive have&#13;
been grouped under the nine divisions). The terms of reference of Member-Directors have&#13;
deleted the requirement to manage research, thus eliminating a conflict between them and&#13;
the ARI managers.&#13;
3.16   Research priority setting. Definition of research priorities, including effective mechanisms to link&#13;
them to farmers' needs, is the essential feature of the operation. BARC and ISNAR have completed an ex-&#13;
ante economic analysis of research priorities for the major commodities. The study asked how much should&#13;
be invested in research on those commodities. To answer that question, it estimates the expected net&#13;
economic benefits of research on each commodity. The results are shown in Annex 4. Because the method&#13;
has been used already in Bangladesh with national data and technical parameters, it is simple to apply it in&#13;
the proposed operation. At negotiations, the Government agreed to a method of ex-ante economic analysis,&#13;
acceptable to IDA, and would apply it as part of BARC and ARI evaluation of research projects in the&#13;
ARI Master Plans (para. 4.1(e)).&#13;
3.17   Research preparation and evaluation guidelines. Linked to the ex-ante economic analysis of&#13;
research projects are new research preparation and evaluation guidelines. At negotiations, the Government&#13;
agreed to: (a) guidelines acceptable to IDA (Annex 3); and (b) apply the guidelines to all research projects,&#13;
including those for projects funded under the Contract Research Scheme, beginning July 1, 1996 (para.&#13;
4.1(f)).&#13;
3.18   BARC Secretariat (USS4.76 million).  To enable BARC's Secretariat to better serve the&#13;
Governing Body and the ARIs in research planning, monitoring and evaluation, the project would&#13;
strengthen the Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation and Coordination (PMEC) Division, and Agricultural&#13;
Economics and Rural Sociology (AERS) Division. The project would provide for training and technical&#13;
assistance, focusing on research management, planning and evaluation, budgeting and accounting, and&#13;
computerized information and financial systems. The project would also strengthen the information and&#13;
computer centers through provision of civil works and equipment including computers and library&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
materials. Training constitutes advanced degree and short-term training mainly in research management,&#13;
statistics, economics, and information management.&#13;
3.19   The PMEC Division, which embodies the main function of BARC's Secretariat, would remain&#13;
responsible for long-and medium-term research planning. It would be entrusted with: establishing&#13;
procedures for research planning, priority-setting, and evaluation; extending such procedures and skills to&#13;
ARls; updating the agricultural research strategic plan; and coordinating research activities across NARS,&#13;
ensuring adequate linkages among ARIs and between ARIs and the extension services. It would review&#13;
research proposals prepared by the ARTs. In fulfilling these functions, it would have full access to the MIS&#13;
and the budgeting and accounting system (BAS), and would seek help from the specialized divisions within&#13;
the Secretariat and from the statisticians in the Computer Center. Technical assistance in research&#13;
management would be provided under the proposed operation to assist with research planning, priority-&#13;
setting and evaluation.&#13;
3.20   Technical Assistance (USS1.19 million). BARC's Secretariat requires technical assistance to&#13;
assist with project implementation. The priority areas were agreed at appraisal as being: (a) research&#13;
management; (b) financial management; (c) supervision of civil works construction and rehabilitation; and&#13;
(d) local supervision of technical and managerial aspects of research.&#13;
(a)    Research management. BARC would first contract a research management expert,&#13;
whose main job would be to assist in completing the ARI Master Plans, where needed5.&#13;
This consultant is expected to be contracted from ISNAR in the approximate amount of&#13;
US$0.56 million, which has specialized expertise in the field and has substantial&#13;
experience in Bangladesh. The consultant, assisted by occasional short-term technical&#13;
assistance, would conduct in-service training in research management, and in use of the&#13;
computerized MIS to BARC's staff of the PMEC, the Information and Computer centers,&#13;
and ARIs' staff responsible for research planning and evaluation.&#13;
(b)    Financial management. BARC would contract a long-term financial management expert&#13;
from a qualified and reputed local accounting firm to establish and implement an&#13;
integrated project budget and cost accounting system. The financial management expert&#13;
would be responsible, inter alia, for monitoring financial performance under the operation,&#13;
including the timely flow of funds to executing agencies and for training local staff.&#13;
(c)    Supervising architect. BARC would contract a qualified local architect-planner to assist&#13;
supervise the executing architects at the planning stage for all civil works to be constructed&#13;
or rehabilitated under the operation.&#13;
(d)    Local technical supervision. BARC would contract qualified local technical experts, in&#13;
both managerial and scientific fields, to assist with supervision of the operation. These&#13;
consultants would be paid from the credit and would report jointly to IDA and to BARC.&#13;
Roughly five staff-months annually have been budgeted for this sub-component.&#13;
3.21   AERS (USS0.35 million). Economic analysis in BARC would be fortified . BARC's Secretariat&#13;
would establish a Technical Committee for Socioeconomic Research in Agriculture (TCSERA), consisting&#13;
5 For example, FRI has already completed its Master Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
of senior staff of the AERS Division and their counterparts in ARIs. It would report to the Executive&#13;
Committee of BARC on the socioeconomic aspects of ARIs' research programs. The work of the social&#13;
scientists and the TCSERA would be enhanced by the data bank of agricultural research. The project&#13;
would provide for (a) staff training in financial and economic analysis of agricultural production systems,&#13;
socioeconomic research, data base management; and (b) computers and incremental operational&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
3.22   Contract Research (US$7.69 million). BARC operates a Contract Research Grant Scheme to&#13;
focus research efforts on priority problems, and to foster interinstitutional and interdisciplinary work. The&#13;
objective is to use the scientific expertise of universities, NGOs, the private sector, and other research and&#13;
training organizations for national agricultural research priorities. The scheme gives BARC potentially&#13;
greater powers to review, monitor and evaluate research.&#13;
3.23       Under the proposed operation, the Contract Research procedures would be strengthened. The&#13;
procedures will cover advertising the availability of grants, formats for submission of research proposals,&#13;
technical criteria and procedures for making awards, financial and technical reporting, disbursement and&#13;
accounting, and evaluation and publication of results. BARC will continue to evaluate suitable subprojects&#13;
on a competitive basis through its Technical Committees to assure that selected proposals are&#13;
complementary to the core research efforts of the ARls. Following the approval of the Technical&#13;
Committee, BARC's financial committee will review the subproject before final approval by BARC's&#13;
Chairman. BARC consultants, provided by the project, will aid subproject selection. BARC has revised its&#13;
manual of rules for subproject selection to ensure the eligibility of good proposals and to eliminate delays in&#13;
approving projects. The rules would specify, inter alia, that institutions other than BARC and the ARJs,&#13;
including, but not limited to, universities, NGOs, the Cotton Development Board, BINA, SRDI, and BTRI&#13;
would be eligible to compete for funds allocated to contract research. The Bangladesh Agricultural&#13;
University (BAU) and the Institute for Postgraduate Studies in Agriculture could, for example, compete for&#13;
contract research funds. At negotiations (part. 4.1 (g)), the Government agreed to: (a) that BARC will be&#13;
responsible for the evaluation of research proposals made under the Contract Research Scheme and to&#13;
approve grants; (b) apply rules and procedures for evaluation and funding approval of contract research&#13;
proposals made to the BARC Secretariat based on the guidelines for the preparation and approval of new&#13;
research projects (Annex 3); (c) a public announcement of the contract research fund; and (d) draft&#13;
standard contracts.&#13;
3.24   Joint contract research initiatives. Because there has been poor interaction across ARls on&#13;
common problems in the past (e.g., rice/wheat systems or agroforestry), a significant feature of contract&#13;
research will be to encourage joint initiatives across ARIs. Part of the contract research funds would be&#13;
initially allocated for such initiatives. The allocation of money to these joint initiatives would be decided&#13;
collaboratively by BARC and the ARIs using the normal contract research procedures with the exception&#13;
that the broad areas of collaboration would be defined in advance. Possible initiatives are rice/wheat&#13;
systems, hill farming, fish and shrimp-rice systems, agroforestry, and rice/fiber crops/vegetable crops&#13;
production. For these joint research initiatives, the contract facility may allocate grants for research&#13;
proposal preparation so that lack of seed money does not inhibit good proposals. At negotiations, the&#13;
Government agreed on joint initiatives across ARIs acceptable to IDA; each initiative would include terms&#13;
of reference for studies of environmental issues in the area of the initiative (para.4. 1 (h)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
2. Priority Research (USS40.57 million)&#13;
3.25   The project would support priority research programs in participating ARIs for crops, fisheries,&#13;
livestock, and forestry. Table I provides a cost breakdown by  project component; Annex 1 provides&#13;
additional cost details.&#13;
Crop ARIs&#13;
3.26   The project would support priority research on crops and related (e.g., soils and climatology)&#13;
disciplines at BARI, BRRI, BJRI, and SRI. Expenditure categories are civil works, equipment, training,&#13;
technical assistance, and incremental operating costs.&#13;
3.27   BRRI (US$7.83 million). Ex-ante economic analysis of research on boro, aus, transplanted aman&#13;
and broadcast aman rice show economic rates of return well above the target return of 12 percent. Risk&#13;
analysis indicates that the rates of return are not significantly affected by adverse changes in rice prices or&#13;
in the probability of research success. Because BRRI has a good network of experiment stations and staff,&#13;
provisions under the proposed operation would complement existing facilities and not support a major&#13;
expansion. Civil works include new laboratories at headquarters, residences at Barisal, Habiganj and&#13;
Rajshai regional stations, renovation of buildings at the Comilla regional station and site development at&#13;
Habiganj and Rajshai regional stations. Goods to be provided are vehicles and laboratory and office&#13;
equipment. Training includes advance degree and short-term training, the latter provides for, inter alia,&#13;
participation of rice scientists in regional rice/wheat development programs. Limited incremental operating&#13;
costs would be necessitated by the investment costs.&#13;
3.28       Because of the crucial role of IRRI in generating and transferring rice genetic material&#13;
internationally, and because of the particular technical problems caused by rice-wheat rotations, the project&#13;
would support two additional efforts within BRRI. Rice/wheat initiative. The sequence of rice cropping&#13;
followed by wheat is quite important in Bangladesh; in fact most of the wheat in the country immediately&#13;
succeeds rice. The so-called rice-wheat system requires special land management practices because of its&#13;
rigid rotation and high cropping intensity. An international initiative to study and improve rice-wheat&#13;
systems in the Indo-Gangetic plain, supported by the Bank, is now underway and BRRI will participate in&#13;
it. Collaboration with IRRI. Under the proposed operation, support to the rice-wheat initiative would be&#13;
provided by developing closer collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI).&#13;
3.29   Spending for rice research under the operation would be as follows.&#13;
(a)    Civil works (US$0.70 million) at headquarters and four other principal sites improved&#13;
facilities are required. Investments at headquarters include pathology and entomology&#13;
laboratories and an irrigation network. At other sites, new or renovated works would&#13;
comprise residences, stores, laboratory rehabilitation, and farm development.&#13;
(b)    Training and technical assistance (US$3.58 million) would comprise about 55 staff-&#13;
years of graduate training, both foreign and national, and about 65 staff-months of short-&#13;
term work. Areas of graduate study are economics, biotechnology, agronomy, soils, plant&#13;
breeding, and others. Funding would be available for approximately US$1.0 million in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
foreign technical assistance related to rice production in general and more specifically for&#13;
the rice-wheat initiative (para. 3.28).&#13;
(c)    Vehicles (US$0.23 million). Four-wheel drive vehicles are needed for staff transport to&#13;
on-farm and other field sites.&#13;
(d)    Laboratory, computing and other equipment (US$0.62 million). Computing equipment&#13;
and software for data analysis would be upgraded as BRRI is weak in this field. A small&#13;
quantity of additional lab equipment would be provided to a few major sites.&#13;
(e)    Recurrent operating costs (US$2.70 million). Incremental recurrent costs would be&#13;
funded to operate, maintain, and repair civil works, vehicles, lab and farn equipment. No&#13;
incremental salaries would be supported at BRRI.&#13;
3.30   BARI (US$6.78 million). Ex-ante economic analysis of research investments to be made by BARI&#13;
in such major crops as wheat, potato, mustard, banana, lentil, groundnut, and pulses show those&#13;
investments to be highly profitable (Annex 4, Table A4.2). The profitability of the investments is,&#13;
moreover, robust with respect to possible adverse changes in commodity prices and in the probability of&#13;
research success (Annex 4, Table A4.2). In light of the expected returns to BARI research, the proposed&#13;
project would support an expansion and reinforcement of BARI programs that: (a) have already produced&#13;
results; (b) have basic infrastructure and staff; (c) study priority problems with clear objectives; and (d)&#13;
have no other external funding.&#13;
3.31   Spending under the project would be as follows.&#13;
(a)    Civil works (USS0.68 million) at headquarters and other sites (including the agronomy&#13;
and post-harvest technology divisions, the Wheat Research Center, and the Oilseeds&#13;
Research Center) where additional facilities are essential. Facilities at headquarters include&#13;
an irrigation channel, a boundary wall and fencing, a road and a deep tubewell. Civil&#13;
works at other sites include farm site development, farm roads, renovations of buildings,&#13;
and new staff residences.&#13;
(b)    Training and technical assistance (US$2.72 million) would comprise about 60 staff-&#13;
years of graduate training, both foreign and national, and about 90 staff-months of short-&#13;
term non-degree work. Areas of graduate study are agricultural economics, seed&#13;
technology, genetic resources, biotechnology, agronomy, and soils. Approximately 30&#13;
months of short-term foreign technical assistance would be provided in both scientific and&#13;
management areas.&#13;
(c)    Vehicles and farm equipment (US$1.27 million). Four-wheel drive vehicles are needed&#13;
for staff transport to on-farm and other field sites. Additional farm equipment would be&#13;
provided at a few priority sites.&#13;
(d)    Laboratory and computing equipment (USS0.47 million). Computing equipment and&#13;
software are required for modern data processing and analysis and BARI currently has&#13;
inadequate computing facilities. A small quantity of additional lab equipment would be&#13;
provided to a few sites.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
(e)    Recurrent operating costs (US$1.64 million). Incremental recurrent costs would be&#13;
funded to operate, maintain, and repair civil works, vehicles, lab and farm equipment. No&#13;
incremental salaries would be funded at BARI.&#13;
3.32   BJRI (USS1.46 million). The ex-ante ERR of jute research is only 11. 1 percent (Annex 4, Table&#13;
A.4. 1). If the jute price were to fall by 25 percent, then the ERR would be 5.3 %. The average return to&#13;
jute research would tend to have fallen because of the decline in world prices and the associated contraction&#13;
in area planted. Nonetheless, jute is an important cash crop, is well adapted to some marginal conditions&#13;
where rice cannot be grown, and has some potential for revival if production costs can be lowered.&#13;
Because of the economic risks involved, jute research in the operation is limited to a much smaller total cost&#13;
than that projected in the ex-ante economic analysis. Initial project supervision, which will be tighter for&#13;
BJRI because of the rate of return risks, will focus closely on implementation and technical problems with&#13;
jute research to identify problems and propose early solutions. In addition, financing of jute research will&#13;
be an important part of the study of options to increase private sector financing of research on all&#13;
commodities (para. 2.42).&#13;
3.33   Under the operation, BJRI will be strengthened in the agricultural and technology areas (post-&#13;
harvest processing). The project will also provide graduate degree and short-term training, field equipment&#13;
for the agricultural area, laboratory and processing equipment for the technology area, technical assistance&#13;
in both agriculture and technology, and limited operating expenses for BJRI's laboratories.&#13;
3.34   SRI (USS1.50 million). The ex-ante economic analysis of sugarcane research has an ERR of&#13;
35.5 % (Annex 4, Table A.4.1), much greater than the cutoff retum. The average return was insensitive&#13;
to adverse changes in prices and success probabilities. Despite the excellent expected retums to sugarcane&#13;
research, the operation proposes only limited support to SRI because of institutional difficulties, in&#13;
particular the lack of attention to date to the production of gur (molasses) and chewing cane. The goal of&#13;
SRI is to produce improved varieties and production practices for milled sugar. This would be partly&#13;
reoriented under the operation. While SRI has generally adequate staff and basic facilities to achieve its&#13;
program, to augment those facilities, the project would provide for civil works (renovation of controlled&#13;
room);  vehicles; laboratory and office equipment; graduate degree and short-term training;  and&#13;
incremental O&amp;M costs.&#13;
Fisheries, Forestry, and Livestock ARIs&#13;
3.35   FRI (US$9.45 million). The ex-ante economic analysis shows that overall FRI research across the&#13;
four main areas-freshwater fisheries, riverine, brackish, and marine-would be economically profitable; the&#13;
expected ERR for FRI as a whole would be 53.2% (Annex 4, Table A4.1). However, in the areas of&#13;
riverine, brackish, and marine fisheries the ex-ante rates of return are lower (between 11.4 % and 17.3%)&#13;
and are subject to adverse risks from low commodity prices and low probabilities of research success. The&#13;
plans of technical assistance and of IDA supervision for the FRI component of the proposed operation&#13;
consider these rate of return risks and corrective actions will be taken as needed during implementation&#13;
(Annex 7). Moreover, FRI research is in an environmentally and socially important area and should&#13;
produce benefits both for the environment and for the poorest groups in the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
3.36   FRI's program starts from the principles of greater production from culture fisheries; protecting&#13;
systems at risk (notably culture shrimp and inland capture fisheries); continuing in the mandated areas of&#13;
the respective stations; and more interdisciplinary aquatic research. Investments have been designed so as&#13;
not to duplicate those provided under the IDA-supported Third Fisheries Project; research activities under&#13;
that project cover mainly floodplains fisheries that would not receive help from the proposed operation. On&#13;
the basis of those principles, the project would support the following essential research areas:&#13;
(a)    Headquarters and freshwater fisheries (USS3.42 million). Additional work is necessary&#13;
to complete the institute's headquarters at Mymensingh in fisheries policy and economics,&#13;
planning and management, physical facilities. At the Mymensingh freshwater station, the&#13;
operation would assist with core programs on pond productivity management and on stock&#13;
improvement of commercially important fish. Sub-programs include studies of feed and&#13;
nutrition, fish pathology, and integrated fish/livestock systems.&#13;
(b)    Riverine fisheries at Chandpur (US$1.68 million). There are two core programs, one&#13;
on the carrying capacity of riverine systems (including population dynamics of the major&#13;
species) and one on the man-made changes in inland waters and their effects on fish. The&#13;
sub-programs include studies of conservation and management of Hilsa and other riverine&#13;
species, as well as floodplain fisheries. The operation would support new civil works ( a&#13;
deep tubewell, water storage and electricity supply), a boat and vehicles for field surveys,&#13;
laboratory equipment, computing and other office equipment, long and short-term training,&#13;
local and foreign technical assistance, and operating costs, including provisions for&#13;
additional staff to bring the staff to its desired complement;&#13;
(c)    Brackish water fisheries at Paikgacha (US$2.29 million). The core programs are brood&#13;
stock management for culture fishing and estuarine ecology and biology. Sub-programs are&#13;
hatchery and nursery development, water quality, predator management, and reducing the&#13;
environmental impact of shrimp farming. The operation would assist with civil works (a&#13;
tubewell, pond and land development, a service building and jetty, residences, and a&#13;
laboratory), a boat and vehicles, short and long-term training, local and foreign technical&#13;
assistance, and recurrent operating costs, including salaries of additional staff;&#13;
(d)    Marine fisheries research at the Cox's Bazar (US$2.06 million). The core programs&#13;
would be on productivity assessment and population dynamics of the marine fishery&#13;
resources and on mariculture of finfish, weeds, and mollusks. The proposed operation&#13;
would support civil works (a seawater pump, line, and settling tank for mariculture&#13;
studies), new divisions in the existing experimental ponds to allow better replication of&#13;
experiments, residences, training, technical assistance, computing and office equipment;&#13;
and incremental recurrent costs.&#13;
3.37 The project would provide laboratory, office and field equipment, technical assistance, training and&#13;
incremental O&amp;M costs at each site.&#13;
3.38    BFRI (US$7.22 million). The ex-ante economic analysis of BFRI research gave ERRs well&#13;
above the cutoff rate for both commercial and homestead forestry systems: 35.8 % for timber and 26.6 %&#13;
for bamboo. Neither ERR was sensitive to changes in product prices or in the probability of research&#13;
success. To achieve the expected positive economic benefits of BFRI's work the proposed operation would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
support a move from a project approach to a more focused and coherent program approach addressing&#13;
constraints to forestry production. Agreed essential areas are: (a) plantation establishment including farm&#13;
forestry; (b) forest management; (c) socioeconomics and community participation in forestry; (d) minor&#13;
forest products; (e) wood preservation; (f) seed production and (g) linkages with extension and NGOs. The&#13;
project would support BFRI restructuring along these priority areas, including the nomination of a full-time&#13;
administrator, and the corresponding restriction of the current post of Research Manager to research&#13;
management exclusively.&#13;
3.39   Project provisions for BFRI are as follows.&#13;
(a)    Civil works (US$3.16 million). Much of BFRI's headquarters at Chittagong needs&#13;
rehabilitation or additional construction. Works there include residences, a library&#13;
extension, a road and boundary wall, and laboratories; existing labs, water supply,&#13;
residences, and utilities would be rehabilitated.&#13;
(b)    Training and technical assistance (US$1.25 million) comprise about 24 staff-years of&#13;
graduate training, both foreign and national, and about 40 staff-months of short-tern non-&#13;
degree work . Areas of graduate study are breeding, wood technology, economics, genetic&#13;
resources, biotechnology, agronomy, and soils. Approximately 24 months of short-term&#13;
foreign technical assistance would be provided in management, technology transfer, wood&#13;
technology, and wildlife biology.&#13;
(c)    Vehicles (US$0.42 million). Four-wheel drive vehicles are needed for staff transport to&#13;
on-farm and other field sites. Additional heavy trucks are required for wood transport.&#13;
(d)    Laboratory and computing equipment (USS0.13 million). Computing equipment and&#13;
software and limited new lab equipment would be provided.&#13;
(e)    Recurrent operating costs (US$2.26 million). Incremental recurrent costs would be&#13;
funded to operate, maintain, and repair civil works, vehicles, lab and farm equipment.&#13;
Incremental salaries and operation travel costs would be funded for two scientists&#13;
annually.&#13;
3.40   BLRI (US$6.32 million). Ex-ante economic analysis of research on eggs, broilers, small&#13;
runinants, milk and beef gave ERRs ranging from 33.7 % (cattle) to 51.8 % (eggs). To achieve these&#13;
projected benefits, institutional and scientific strengthening of BLRI is necessary. Five priority efforts have&#13;
been identified for support under the proposed operation:&#13;
(a)    Completion of headquarters (US$1.71 million). As BLRI is a new ARI (created in&#13;
1984), work remains to finish its headquarters facilities. Under the proposed operation,&#13;
support would be provided to complete a main laboratory, residences, and a road at Savar.&#13;
Computing and other office equipment would be provided. Funds would also be available&#13;
for short-term training and for operations and maintenance.&#13;
(b)    Economics (US$0.54 million). Though livestock production is an important component&#13;
of practically all Bangladeshi farming systems, the economics of both new and traditional&#13;
systems are poorly understood. The operation would assist in quantifying economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
constraints to livestock production through the provision of vehicles (to facilitate field&#13;
surveys), computing and office equipment for data analysis, training and technical&#13;
assistance, as well as recurrent costs involved in field surveys and data analysis.&#13;
(c)    Ruminant Nutrition and Forage (USS1.93 miflion) . Ruminant nutrition is a costly&#13;
production constraint under the extreme land scarcity typical of Bangladesh. Research in&#13;
this area has not been adequate in the past in BLRI. Under the operation assistance would&#13;
be provided to study improvemnent of feeds and nutrition for cattle, goats and sheep. The&#13;
operation would support investments in a feedmill, feed stores, secure fencing of animal&#13;
facilities, vehicles for on-farm trials, farm equipment for forage production, and office&#13;
equipment for data analysis. Other support would be provided for training, short-term&#13;
technical assistance, and limited recurrent costs.&#13;
(d)    Animal Health (USS1.61 million) . Animl health is another costly constraint to livestock&#13;
production. BLRI has some capacity in this area, but it requires strengthening. The&#13;
proposed operation would assist consolidation and upgrading of laboratories for research&#13;
on key animal diseases (and related interactions with nutritional status). The operation&#13;
would provide for a disease isolation shed at Savar, rehabilitation of offices and&#13;
laboratory at Mymensingh, staff housing at Mymensingh, lab and computer equipment at&#13;
Mymensingh, short and long-term training, technical assistance, and limited recurrent costs&#13;
for operations, maintenance, and repair.&#13;
(e)    Poultry breeding (US$0.53 million). Expanded poultry production has the potential to&#13;
raise incomes of the landless and small farmers with few income-generating alternatives.&#13;
The proposed operation would assist in the development of improved scavenger ducks and&#13;
poultry birds for village use through breeding. Project provisions include experimental&#13;
animals, pens, office and computing equipment, training, technical assistance, and limited&#13;
operating costs.&#13;
3. Participatory Farming Systems Research (USS4.56 million)&#13;
3.41   ARMP would improve research-extension linkages by sharpening the client orientation of FSR&#13;
through methods that strengthen the participation of extension staff and farmers. The FSR will test, analyze&#13;
and verify the adaptability and sustainability of technologies in farmers' conditions. It will also provide&#13;
necessary recommendations and training to extensionists for faster dissemination of appropriate technology.&#13;
Where tested technologies are inappropriate, FSR would provide information to commodity researchers&#13;
about how to fit new technologies into Bangladeshi farming systems.&#13;
3.42   The ARIs will implement the FSR program at 15 field sites with overall coordination of the&#13;
National Coordinated Farming System Research and Development Program (NCFSRP) at BARC.&#13;
Coordination by BARC is desirable in order to harmonize field and analytic methods and to provide a&#13;
common focus across the various commodities studied. In BARC a full time unit, consisting of a national&#13;
coordinator and a multidisciplinary team, will coordinate the program. At the ARI field sites, a&#13;
multidisciplinary group of a site leader, an economist from the ARI in charge of the site, and one specialist&#13;
for each of the participating subsectors will operate the program. For the ARIs in which FSR is not well-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
developed (e.g. BLRI and FRI) participation in FSR will consist of joint initiatives with BARI, BRRI and&#13;
other ARIs where system linkages are important.&#13;
3.43 ARMP will fund the NCFSRP Unit within BARC, and at 15 FSR sites managed by the seven&#13;
participating ARI. The cost of the NCFSRP Unit in BARC is US$1.31 million; the cost of the 15 FSR&#13;
sites managed by the ARIs is US$3.25 million. Provisions include staff training, technical assistance,&#13;
vehicles, a few new stag office and field equipment and operational costs of research and diagnostic&#13;
surveys in farmers' fields. Little new recruitment is necessary as most staff are already in place, with the&#13;
exceptions of FRI and BLRI, who would each recruit about 15 new FSR staff. The additional staff are&#13;
justified in view of the important interactions among crops, livestock and fisheries in Bangladesh and in&#13;
view of the current weaknesses in how such interactions are studied within the Bangladesh NARS.&#13;
3.44 The Govermment agreed at negotiations to complete the following FSR action plan by December&#13;
31, 1996: (a) BARC will confirm that BJRI, FRI, BLRI, and BFRI have appointed a core group of&#13;
qualified scientists with substantial experience in FSR to leadership positions (senior scientific officer&#13;
[SSO] and above); (b) BARI will appoint suitable staff for its On-farm Research Division in all nine&#13;
extension regions; (c) BARC will appoint a suitably qualified FSR coordinator, in collaboration with the&#13;
ARTs; (d) BARC, in collaboration with the ARTs, DAE, DOF and DLS, will have prepared an action plan&#13;
to use participatory FSR methods; and (e) BARC and the ARIs will have created a mechanism satisfactory&#13;
to IDA for collaboration in FSR, specifying roles and responsibilities of each of the ARIs and BARC&#13;
(para. 4.1(i)).&#13;
E. Project Implementation&#13;
3.45. The ARIs will manage their respective components in the priority research component. BARC's&#13;
Secretariat will be the implementing agency for the Research Management and Organization component; it&#13;
will administer contract research, fanming systems research coordinating, staff development and training. A&#13;
project subcommittee satisfactory to IDA has been established and would be maintained during the life of&#13;
the operation. The chairman of BARC chairs the subcommittee. Other members are designates of the chief&#13;
executives of the relevant ARTs, representatives of the extension services at least at the level of director;&#13;
representatives of the participating ministries, including finance, at the level of at least deputy secretary;&#13;
and BARC's Member Director Planning and Evaluation who would serve as the Secretary of the&#13;
subcommittee.&#13;
3.46. BARC and each ARI will prepare semiannual reports, acceptable to IDA, showing progress against&#13;
targets, with explanation of delays, an outline of remedial actions, and a plan of action for the next six&#13;
months. The agencies will report to their ministries, BARC, and IDA within three months after the six-&#13;
month period. BARC's reports will describe the physical aspects of its component, implementation of&#13;
policy reforms, budget, and the updating of the agricultural research strategy. Evaluation of the project and&#13;
of research would be done by the implementing agencies, and lessons learned would be incorporated in the&#13;
following year's programs. The PMEC Division of the Secretariat would review all annual reports and&#13;
programs. Evaluation reports would be analyzed and discussed by BARC when decisions are being made&#13;
on future programs of the agencies. An external review of BARC would be done every five years; its&#13;
conclusions would also be discussed by the Governing Body of BARC and other government officials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
3.47   Project implementation is planned for five years. During the first year, the main focus would be on&#13;
contracting consultants' services and beginning field work as part of the participatory FSR component.&#13;
Construction would be initiated for important civil works (staff housing at all sites, Cox's Bazar station of&#13;
FRI, the rehabilitation of BFRI, laboratories for BLRI). Procurement of other civil works, vehicles,&#13;
equipment, and livestock would be phased throughout the implementation period.&#13;
1. Project Costs&#13;
3.48 Total project costs are estimated at US$59.1 million (summarized by expenditure category in Table&#13;
2). Project baseline costs are estimated at US$52.9 million; physical contingencies are estimated to be&#13;
US$2.2 million and price contingencies are estimated to be US$4.0 million. An IDA credit would provide&#13;
US$50.0 million and the Government of Bangladesh would provide US$9.10 million. Of the total project&#13;
cost, US$46.2 million would be for investment and US$12.9 would be for incremental recurrent costs.&#13;
Costs are based on 1995 prices and include appropriate physical contingencies ranging from 5 to 15&#13;
percent. Price contingencies are based on projected domestic inflation rates for local costs of 4 percent in&#13;
1996 and 1997, 4.5 percent in 1998 and 1999, and 5 percent in 2000; and for projected foreign inflation of&#13;
2.6 percent each year.&#13;
2. Project Financing&#13;
3.49   An IDA Credit of US$50.0 million equivalent would finance about 85 percent of project costs (net&#13;
of taxes and duties) and be made available to GOB on standard IDA terms. GOB would finance the&#13;
remainder of US$9.1 million equivalent (Table 3). GOB's contribution, including US$1.40 million&#13;
equivalent in taxes and duties, would be supplied through annual budget appropriations in accordance with&#13;
approved Project Proformas (PP) and the project implementation schedule. The PP would be based on a&#13;
Project Concept Paper (PCP) prepared by GOB. Approval by IDA of a satisfactory PP is a condition of&#13;
effectiveness (para 4.2(b)). To permit initiation of priority activities before credit effectiveness, retroactive&#13;
financing of up to US$0.5 million would be made available for eligible expenditures, chiefly those incurred&#13;
with preparation of the ARI Master Plans, the laboratory equipment action plans and technical assistance.&#13;
3. Procurement&#13;
3.50   Table 4 summarizes procurement arrangements. All procurement will be done with IDA's&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents. All bidding packages and bid evaluation reports for the first three contracts&#13;
for civil works would be subject to IDA's prior review. Also subject to prior review are contracts for all&#13;
civil works estimated to cost more than US$150,000; all imported goods and equipment estimated to cost&#13;
more than US$100,000 in the aggregate; and the principal BARC technical assistance contracts (para.&#13;
3.55). Procurement subject to prior review would represent about 53 percent of Bank-financed procurement&#13;
under the operation, excluding recurrent costs. The remaining contracts, which are subject to post review,&#13;
are not suitable for prior review because they consist of graduate and short-term training of many small&#13;
groups of students, minor civil works, small lots of local goods and equipment, and numerous short&#13;
consultancies.&#13;

3.51   Civil Works (USS9.5 million). Civil works to be financed under the project include new&#13;
construction, rehabilitation of existing buildings and site development. New construction in the amount of&#13;
US$7.10 million would be procured in approximately 75 packages across six implementing agencies. Civil&#13;
works would be procured using national competitive bidding (NCB) as they would be small, labor intensive&#13;
and dispersed over agencies, space and time. The key works are a central training and complex facility for&#13;
BARC and the ARls; residences, offices, and laboratories at BARI's Dinajpur station; laboratories at BRRI&#13;
headquarters; residences and a guest house at BRRI's Barisal station; feed mill and animal housing for&#13;
BLRI at Savar; laboratories, offices and housing at BLRI, Mymensingh; housing and offices at FRI,&#13;
Mymensingh; tubewells and other site development at FRI's Paikgacha station; housing, service buildings&#13;
and a sea water inlet at FRI's Cox's Bazar station; and library extension, and two laboratories at BFRI in&#13;
Chittagong. At negotiations, the Government agreed that a qualified supervising architect, to be contracted&#13;
by BARC under the project, would supervise the work of all executing architects contracted by individual&#13;
executing agencies (para. 4.1(j)).&#13;

3.52   Goods (US$9.3 million). Goods include vehicles, boats, computers and other office equipment,&#13;
and laboratory and field equipment. Vehicles include four-wheel drives, double-cabin pick-ups,&#13;
motorcycles, bicycles, buses, trucks, and motorized fishing boats; they would be procured in the amount of&#13;
US$3.6 million in eight packages across all implementing agencies. Office equipment, including computers&#13;
and related goods, would be procured in eight packages in the amount of US$1.5 million across the&#13;
implementing agencies. International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures would be used to procure&#13;
vehicles, computers, and laboratory equipment costing more than US$50,000 per contract, with an&#13;
estimated total cost of US$8.8 million. For the remaining purchases of equipment and furniture, which&#13;
would be spread over time and over eight implementing agencies in three ministries, procurement would be&#13;
made following local shopping procedures up to a maximum aggregate of US$0.5 million.&#13;
3.53    There are special provisions to procure laboratory equipment.  Because much laboratory&#13;
equipment is poorly maintained, inoperative, or only partly operative, it is necessary to improve its&#13;
utilization before acquiring new equipment. At negotiations, the Govermment agreed that: (a) BARC will&#13;
update the existing inventory of laboratory equipment in the ARIs, indicating the operational state of each&#13;
item in the inventory; (b) each ARI will develop a plan for repair, maintenance and operation of its existing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
and projected laboratory equipment, including necessary operating costs; and (c) IDA will not finance&#13;
laboratory equipment in an ARI until its inventory and maintenance plan is updated (para. 4.1(k)).&#13;
3.54 Training (US$13.9 million). Both foreign and domestic training would be financed. At appraisal,&#13;
procedures satisfactory to IDA were agreed to administer training under the operation. Procedures for&#13;
administering training during the first and second projects have been streamlined to avoid delays. BARC's&#13;
Secretariat, in consultation with ARls, would coordinate and monitor the staff development and training&#13;
program, administer funds and award fellowships and grants. All training opportunities would be&#13;
advertised nationally and awards would be based on written recommendations from research organizations.&#13;
The Master Plan of each ARI will include a training module specifying training needs and procedures&#13;
during the plan period. Graduate training, including roughly 146 years of PhD studies and 51 years of MSc&#13;
studies, would be procured across all executing agencies.&#13;
3.55   Technical Assistance (US$13.5 million). At appraisal, procedures satisfactory to IDA were&#13;
agreed to administer technical assistance (TA) under the project. Most of the TA will consist of assistance&#13;
to implementation of the operation. All consultants services would be contracted using IDA Guidelines for&#13;
the Use of Consultants. Roughly US$5.3 million would be internationally recruited, including&#13;
approximately US$0.56 million for sole-sourced consultants from ISNAR for research management&#13;
(para.3.20 (a)). There would be roughly 380 person-months of short-term internationally recruited technical&#13;
assistance, with packages of 122 months BARC, 95 months (BARI), 60 months (FRI), and smaller&#13;
amounts for the other participating ARls. The remaining US$8.2 million would consist of contract research&#13;
(para. 3.22). Prior to initiating procurement, terms of reference will be prepared by the respective ARIs in&#13;
consultation with BARC and will be cleared by their respective ministries. At negotiations, the Government&#13;
agreed to: (a) standard terms of reference acceptable to IDA for the principal BARC consultants; and&#13;
(b) contract the principal BARC consultants no later than June 30, 1996 (para. 4.1 (1)).&#13;
4. Disbursements&#13;
3.56   Disbursements from the credit would cover:&#13;
(a)    80 percent of civil works expenditures;&#13;
(b)    100 percent of foreign expenditures for directly imported goods and equipment; 100&#13;
percent of ex-factory costs of such items manufactured in Bangladesh; and 70 percent of&#13;
total expenditures for goods and equipment procured locally;&#13;
(c)    100 percent of contract research grants;&#13;
(d)    100 percent of costs of training and technical assistance; and&#13;
(e)    an average of 49 percent of incremental recurrent costs including staff salaries and other&#13;
operating costs, on a declining basis at 80 percent for FY97 and FY98, 60 percent for&#13;
FY99 and FY00 and 40 percent thereafter.&#13;

Note: Figures in parenthesis are the respective amounts financed by IDA&#13;
3.57    Disbursements against expenditures on contracts exceeding US$150,000 for civil works and those&#13;
exceeding US$100,000 for vehicles, equipment, goods, consultancy services and training would be fully&#13;
documented. IDA would disburse against statements of expenditure (SOE) for all other expenditures.&#13;
Supporting documents for SOEs would be available for inspection by auditors and IDA review missions,&#13;
and retained by implementing agencies for one year after the Credit closing date. Disbursements are&#13;
projected over five years from July 1996 to December 2001 (Annex 2). The completion date is June 30,&#13;
2001 and the credit closing date is December 31, 2001.&#13;
3.58    Special Account.  A  special account would be established in Bangladesh Bank with a total&#13;
authorized allocation of US$4.0 million to facilitate timely payment of project expenditures. The special&#13;
account will have eight sub-accounts in the amounts of US$1.0, 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 0.6, and 0.4 million&#13;
equivalent for BARC's Secretariat, BARI, BRRI, BJRI, SRI, FRI, BLRI, and BFRI respectively, or&#13;
equivalent to three to four months estimated disbursements for each agency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
5. Accounts and Audit&#13;
3.59   Each implementing agency will establish and maintain separate project-related accounts at the sites&#13;
responsible for project execution. Separate accounts will be kept for all expenditures for which withdrawals&#13;
are made with SOEs and from the Special Accounts. Responsibility for consolidation of the accounts at the&#13;
headquarters of BARC and of each ARI will begin at project implementation. The accounts will be&#13;
maintained in accordance with sound internationally recognized accounting principles and practices&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, in line with guidelines on financial reporting and auditing of World Bank projects.&#13;
Auditors acceptable to IDA will audit these accounts, including SOEs and the special accounts. At&#13;
negotiations, the Government agreed that audited accounts and the auditors' reports will be sent to IDA&#13;
within six months of the close of the fiscal year (para 4.1(m)).&#13;
6. Supervision by IDA&#13;
3.60 The cost estimates in Annex 1, and the implementation schedule, implementation indicators and&#13;
impact indicators in Annex 5 were agreed at negotiations as the basis of project execution.&#13;
3.61   Project implementation indicators. Monitorable indicators to follow project implementation were&#13;
agreed at negotiations (para. 4.1(q) and Annex 5, Table A.5.2). These indicators will be updated by&#13;
BARC and the ARIs as implementation proceeds and discussed with IDA during the two annual&#13;
supervisions.&#13;
3.62   Annex 7 presents the supervision plan The project would demand heavy IDA supervision because&#13;
of the multiple agencies and disciplines involved. About 33 staff weeks of supervision would be required in&#13;
the first 24 months when policy reforms are beginning and procurement is heaviest. Supervision would&#13;
drop to roughly 12 annual staff weeks in subsequent years. IDA supervision will monitor: (a)&#13;
implementation of policy refonns; (b) research management, including planning, research quality, linkages&#13;
with extension, procurement, and training; (c) contract research; and (d) performance of consultants.  It&#13;
was agreed at appraisal that the credit would provide resources for local supervision over five years from&#13;
the research management and organization component (para 3.20(d)).&#13;
3.63   Annual Review Cycle. At negotiations, it was agreed that: (a) one of the project supervisions each&#13;
year will be an Annual Review of progress in the previous year and a presentation of the work program in&#13;
the following year; (b) the Annual Review will be done at the time of budget preparation for the following&#13;
year (no later than the end of March); (c) BARC and the ARIs will present their draft Annual Reports to&#13;
the Annual Review; and (d) the Annual Review will decide on funding for each project agency in the&#13;
following year, basing its decision on performance in the previous year (para 4. l(n)).&#13;
3.64   Reports. At negotiations, the Government agreed to produce semiannual reports covering the&#13;
activities of BARC and the ARIs under the operation for all project activities in the previous six months no&#13;
later than March 31 and September 30. The reports would have a format and coverage acceptable to IDA&#13;
(Annex 7), including presentation of project implementation indicators (Annex 5 and para 4.1(o)).&#13;
3.65   Midterm review. GOB and IDA would conduct a midterm review (MTR) before September 30,&#13;
1998 of implementation, problems, and solutions. Particular attention would be given to the impact of the&#13;
policy reforms on BARC and the ARIs, the efficiency of management and the quality of research activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
Thc MTR wold reconmend changes including, if necessary, a reformulation of the project and revision of&#13;
the PPs. At negotiations, the Government agreed: (a) on terms of reference for a midterm review of the&#13;
project to be held no later than September 30, 1998; (b) indicators of project impact; and (c) to make&#13;
necessary changes in project implementation as recommended by the midterm review (para. 4.1(p)).&#13;
3.66   Project impact indicators. The indicators of project impact were agreed at negotiations (para.&#13;
3.65 and Annex 5, Table A.5.3). These indicators will be prepared by BARC and the ARIs and&#13;
complemented by national accounts data and other information as necessary. The indicators and&#13;
comnplementary infonnation will be used to estimate ex-post productivity gains to research.&#13;
F. Benefits, Environmental Effects and Risks&#13;
1. Benefits&#13;
3.67 The expected returns to the project are high because it builds on previous investments in research&#13;
inastuct  and trained staff Improvements in research organization and management would induce&#13;
greater efficiency through the identification of efficient research priorities. Support to priority research&#13;
would generate profitable and appropriate technology that responds to farmers' needs. Farming systems&#13;
research would fortfy links among farmers, extension services and NGOs, and promote the transfer of new&#13;
tchnology to poor farmers, thus increasing production and income. The commodities benefiting from&#13;
research supported under the operation (for example, rice, wheat, potatoes, fish, milk, fruits and&#13;
vegetables) are both produced and consumed by the landless and small farmers, so much of the expected&#13;
research benefits would go to the rural poor.&#13;
3.68   The expected benefits of research on 35 major commodities, comprising more than 95% of&#13;
agricultural output, were estimated using an ex-ante econonic model (Annex 4). The resulting economic&#13;
rates of return (ERRs) were above the 12 percent target return for 32 of the 35 commodities. The average&#13;
of the values across ARIs was 53.4%; the values by ARI ranged from 11.1 % (BJRI, jute research) to 90.7&#13;
% (BRRI rice research). Figure I summarizes analysis of the effects of four additional variables on the&#13;
ERRs for each ARI: (a) 25% lower output prices; (b) a 25% longer time needed for farmers to adopt new&#13;
technology; (c) a 50 % decrease in the probability of successful research; and (d) a 75 % increase in the&#13;
tol cost of research after accounting for the marginal costs of the public funds used to finance the&#13;
scientific institutions. Adverse changes in those variables did not cause the aggregate ERRs of any institute&#13;
to fall below 29%, with the noted exception of jute.&#13;

3.69        The budget impact of the project is small; public expenditure on agriculture (excluding public&#13;
spending on water resources) in the FY96 Annual Development Program (ADP) is planned to be about&#13;
US$243 million and average annual project spending is US$11.8 million, or 5 % of the total. Moreover, the&#13;
impact of the project on the composition of public expenditure is favorable in that it moves spending away&#13;
from market interventions and towards research, which has a greater public goods component.&#13;
2. Environmental Effects&#13;
3.70   Recent Bank economic work6 has concluded that 'intensive agriculture is degrading the soil base&#13;
and poses a threat to its sustainability" It contended that research can provide new technologies to allow&#13;
farmers to manage their resources more sustainably and to reduce the environmental costs of&#13;
intensification. The proposed operation would contribute to generating such technologies.&#13;
3.71   The project has an environmental rating of 'C' because its expected environmental effects are&#13;
positive or neutral. The positive effects are that it supports research to improve agricultural sustainability&#13;
by leading to better recommendations for natural resource management and protection. Examples are soil&#13;
fertility maintenance, replacement of rice monoculture with polyculture, more sustainable rice-wheat&#13;
rotations, and integration of forestry, fisheries, and livestock with cropping. Research on disease and&#13;
insect tolerant cultivars as part of integrated pest management will lessen use of agricultural chemicals and&#13;
reduce health and environmental risks from them. Population and ecological studies and improved&#13;
management practices for freshwater and marine fish will determine ways of maintaining the environment&#13;
and of reversing earlier degradation. The environmental impacts of civil works would be neutral because&#13;
6      Pagiola, Stefano, Enviromnental and Natural Resource Degradation in ntensive Agriculture in Bangladesh , World&#13;
Bank, Enviromnent Departnent Papers, No 15, May 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
the works are generally small and will be done within existing BARC and ARI facilities. The project&#13;
would have no cultural property, indigenous peoples, or resettlement effects.&#13;
3.72 Because reliable quantitative information about the environmental impact of agriculture in&#13;
Bangladesh is scarce, it is urgent to collect additional data during project implementation. At negotations,&#13;
the Government agreed to terms of reference for studies of environmental issues in key farming systems;&#13;
those studies would be done as part of joint research initiatives across several ARIs and would identify the&#13;
need for more detailed analysis of particular problems (para. 3.24).&#13;
3. Risks&#13;
3.73   There are four major risks. They are the Government's ability and commitment to: (a) complete the&#13;
agreed institutional reforms; (b) manage research, including interagency coordination; (c) allocate adequate&#13;
funds to research; and (d) implement all project provisions, including technical assistance and training.&#13;
These risks are addressed as follows: (a) institutional reforms were agreed in advance and are supported&#13;
by a policy statement from the Minister of Agriculture to IDA. The executive orders to implement the new&#13;
research management procedures would be issues before effectiveness (para. 4.2(c)); (b) strengthening&#13;
research management, staff development, and coordination among agencies and clients, including extension,&#13;
NGOs and farmers; (c) a satisfactory arrangement has been made to transfer adequate allocations to the&#13;
revenue budgets for the project. The Government agreed at negotiations that adequate funds would be made&#13;
available for the project (para. 4.1(r)); and (d) timely establishment of a special account for each&#13;
implementing agency, appointment of key managerial positions and recruitment of consultants, streamlining&#13;
implementation of training and contract research, and maintaining a project subcomnittee at BARC to&#13;
monitor implementation. IDA supervision and a mid-term review will identify problems and suggest&#13;
correctives.&#13;
3.74   The major risks to the operation might cause delays in harvesting benefits from research&#13;
investments. These delays have been incorporated into the ex-ante economic analysis (para. 3.68) as a lag&#13;
in adoption of new technologies generated by research (Figure 1, "25% longer adoption time'). An&#13;
adoption time 25 % longer poses no risk that the expected ERRs ratios would fall below 12% in any ARI,&#13;
except BuRI. Particular attention will be paid to BJRI during supervision of the proposed project. There are&#13;
additional specific risks that may affect the Fisheries Research Institute (F!). In the areas of riverine, brackish,&#13;
and marine fisheries, the ex-ante rates of return are lower (between 11.4 % and 17.3%) and are subject to&#13;
adverse risks from low commodity prices and low probabilities of research success. The plans for technical&#13;
assistance and IDA supervision for the FRI component of the proposed operation consider these rate of return&#13;
risks and corrective actions will be taken as needed during implementation. Moreover, FRI research is in an&#13;
enviromnentally and socially important area and should produce benefits both for the environment and for the&#13;
poorest groups in the country.&#13;
&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
3. Rules and Procedures for The Preparation and&#13;
Approval of New Research Projects&#13;
1.    The Bangladesh NARS has developed a new system of preparing and approving research&#13;
projects, including those to be funded by the contract research scheme, that will be applied under&#13;
the project. This attachment reports agreements reached at negotiations on the key steps in the&#13;
system; Table 1 of this Annex summarizes the system.&#13;
Genesis of New Research Projects&#13;
2.     Scientists will define new research projects as regional or national. The former concem a&#13;
problem of a given production region (e.g., intensive marine shrimp culture), as opposed to those&#13;
(e.g., hatchery management) which are important throughout the country. In both types of&#13;
projects, scientists, extension workers, fanners, and others (e.g., NGOs) develop new project ideas,&#13;
which are initially vetted for relevance--i.e., is the proposed research problem one that is likely to&#13;
produce significant benefits to producers and be within their financial and technical means? New&#13;
regional project concepts, including ex-ante evaluation, are vetted by ATC for research relevance.&#13;
New national project concepts, including ex-ante evaluation, are vetted by the National Technical&#13;
Coordination Committee (NTCC) for research relevance.&#13;
Approval of New Research Projects&#13;
3.    ARI Research Committee. An ARI Research Committee, consisting of Research&#13;
Directors and Research Division Heads and other expertise as may be needed, annually reviews&#13;
ongoing and new research projects in light of ATC/NTCC and APRW comments. Proposed new&#13;
projects are also reviewed in light of their consistency with the Master Plan(s) of the ARI(s) and&#13;
are subject to ex-ante economic analysis as needed. The ARI Research Committee subsequently&#13;
consolidates the institution's work program and budget and presents it to the ARI Board of&#13;
Govemors and to the BARC Technical Advisory Committees. The BARC Technical Advisory&#13;
Committees can delegate their review authority at this stage to the ARI Research Committee if it&#13;
chooses.&#13;
4.    APRW. An Annual Program Review Workshop (APRW) is held for each ARI when the&#13;
research budget for the following year is being prepared. The APRW completes peer reviews of&#13;
new research proposals and ongoing research projects. The progress for new regional and national&#13;
projects, and of ongoing projects, is recorded in the report of the APRW.  The report of the&#13;
APRW will be an annex of the Annual Report of each ARI and of BARC.&#13;
5.    BARC Technical Advisory Committees (TACs) which include independent national and&#13;
intemational scientists engaged in the NARS (as appropriate), will review quality of new research&#13;
proposals and advise on orientation or re-orientation of ongoing research projects (on the basis of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -                                Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
draft ARI APRWs). The TACs will review both directly funded research projects and contract&#13;
research. BARC then approves new projects and revises ongoing projects on the basis of TAC&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
Role of the ARI Governors&#13;
6.     The Board of Governors of each ARI oversees ARI management performance and decides&#13;
on annual budgets on the basis of projects reviewed and found acceptable by BARC. The ARI&#13;
Governors grant budget authority to research project leaders when the project has been approved.&#13;
The Contract Research Scheme&#13;
7.     The Contract Research  Scheme provides complementary funds to the ARTs on a&#13;
competitive basis. It funds investment and operating costs, excluding scientists' salaries, outside&#13;
the core programs of the ARIs.   The scheme gives BARC greater powers of research review,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation, and, at a time when other funding is scarce, a degree of authority over&#13;
national research. All institutions involved in agricultural research--including, but not limited to&#13;
the ARIs--are eligible for grants made under the scheme.&#13;
8.     Specific procedures of the Contract Research Scheme--advertising the availability of&#13;
grants, written formats for submission of research proposals, technical criteria and procedures for&#13;
making awards, financial and technical reporting, disbursement and accounting, and evaluation and&#13;
publication of results--would be maintained. All other procedures--genesis of new projects and&#13;
evaluation of projects within the ARIs--would be exactly the same as those for other ARI research.&#13;
Annual Review Cycle&#13;
9.     The Annual Review Cycle will be: (i) presentation of all new research projects to the&#13;
APRW by January 31 (para. 4); (ii) transmittal of the results of the APRWs to the TACs by end&#13;
February (para. 5); and (iii) approval of new projects and budget authorization by end March&#13;
(para. 6).&#13;

Ex-ante economic analysis&#13;
10.    Each ARI will carry out an ex-ante economic analysis of its core research programs at the&#13;
time of preparation of its Master Plan. The essentials of the method of analysis are:&#13;
(a)    analysis at the level of the commodity group (as shown in Table 2 for each ARI)&#13;
for all research projects affecting output of those commodities where a separate&#13;
economic analysis can reasonably be applied.  For example, research on&#13;
transplanted aman rice is expected to be conducted at several sites in Bangladesh.&#13;
Each site should have a separate analysis, if the production conditions and&#13;
expected effect of research at each site warrant it;&#13;
(b)    use of economic prices for internationally traded goods. Economic prices will be&#13;
calculated as the sum of world prices plus all transport and handling costs to the&#13;
point of production for imported goods, and as the remainder of world prices&#13;
minus all transport and handling costs to the point of production for exported&#13;
goods. World prices will be the average prices, as shown in the World Bank's&#13;
Commodity Price Projections (for those goods for which such projections are&#13;
made), expressed in US dollars and converted to Bangladeshi Taka at the&#13;
prevailing market exchange rate.&#13;
(c)    use of domestic market producer prices for goods that are not normally traded&#13;
internationally;&#13;
(d)    use of economic prices for internationally traded additional inputs, adjusted for&#13;
transport and handling costs as in para. IO(b) for output prices.&#13;
(e)    use of domestic market prices for primary factors of production, such as labor,&#13;
land, capital, where capital includes irrigation.&#13;
(f)    use of incremental costs of research programs on the commodity groups;&#13;
(g)    use of the methods and equations shown in Annex 4 of the Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
of the Bangladesh - Agricultural Research Management Project (Report 14467-&#13;
BD of the World Bank), adjusted for new information on research costs, expected&#13;
productivity increments, elasticities of supply and demand, and expected profile of&#13;
producer adoption over time as it becomes available; and&#13;
(h)    reporting of the results of the ex-ante economic analysis in a compatible format&#13;
with that for the results in Annex 4 of the Staff Appraisal Report of the&#13;
Bangladesh - Agricultural Research Management Project (Report 14467-BD of&#13;
the World Bank).&#13;
11.    Ex-ante economic analysis will also be carried out for new research projects that begin&#13;
outside the framework of the agreed Master Plan of each ART.&#13;

AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
4. EX-ANTE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECTS&#13;
1.    This Annex presents an ex-ante economic analysis of agricultural research projects in Bangladesh and&#13;
does sensitivity analysis with respect to output prices, adoption lags, and probability of success of the research&#13;
projects under consideration.  The analysis uses the economic surplus approach, which is now a standard&#13;
technique for estimating the costs and benefits of agncultural research.!   A detailed analysis regarding&#13;
profitability of agricultural research projects for 57 commodities is described in Norton (1992).2&#13;
A. Returns to Agricultural Research&#13;
2.     The economic surplus model is based on the calculation of the net present value of net benefits (NPVB) to&#13;
research spending. Let C, denote the cost of a research project regarding a commodity in year t and R, denote the&#13;
change in total economic surplus as a result of the research project. NPVB is then given by:&#13;
NPVB =    =(Rt - C,)( + r )-t.   (1)&#13;
r is the discount rate and n is the period up to which the returns to the project are realized. The NPVB permits a&#13;
ranking of projects of different size.&#13;
3.     The economic rate of return (ERR) is the discount rate that results in a zero NPVB. It is calculated as:&#13;
0 =   t=Y(R,1-CC)(1+ERR)-t.        (2)&#13;
ERR is useful to compare alternative investments but does not take into account the project size, as NPVB does.&#13;
Data&#13;
4.     The data were obtained from a survey of knowledgeable scientists and administrators in Bangladesh. The&#13;
costs were defined in the survey as those needed to execute research necessary to achieve a given feasible&#13;
increment in commodity yield. They refer to total expenditures, investment and recurrent, for the research project.&#13;
Revenues (or change in economic surplus) depends on the specific market structure. For jute, where Bangladesh's&#13;
export share to total world trade is 35 percent, excess supply shifts affect world price and hence world demand.&#13;
For non-traded commodities (e.g., livestock products and some vegetables), supply shifts will also affect domestic&#13;

price and hence domestic demand. For a traded commodity with a small share in the world market (e.g., rice), a&#13;
horizontal demand schedule is a convenient assumption ("small open economy" setting). A detailed analysis of&#13;
the "small open economy" setting (which is the case with most of the commodities under consideration) is offered&#13;
in the next section.&#13;
Calculation of Research Benefits&#13;
5.    Let P be the relevant domestic producer price of the commodity. For traded goods, it is the world price&#13;
plus (CIF) or minus (FOB) marketing and transportation costs; it is an FOB or CIF equivalent depending on&#13;
whether Bangladesh is usually an importer or an exporter. For non-traded goods, P is the average domestic&#13;
market price. With supply schedule SO, the initial equilibrium quantity is Qo, giving a total value of production&#13;
PQO (Figure 1). After research findings are adopted by producers, supply shifts from So to Si, thus producing Q,&#13;
(or adding H, to the existing output Qo).  In a small open economy, price remains constant at P. Hence, the&#13;
change in revenue due to research in the first period is the sum of the rectangular area K,QO plus the triangular&#13;
area 0.5K,H,, where K, denotes the absolute vertical shift in the supply schedule. Thus, R, can be written as:&#13;
R, = KIQO + O.SK,TH.  (3)&#13;
The calculation of R, requires quantification of K, and H, in terms of known parameters.&#13;
6.    Invoking the definition of supply elasticity, s = (AQ/AP)(P/Q), evaluating E at Qo and P, and rearranging&#13;
terms, results in (for period t):&#13;
Kt = (P/Qo)(Ht/E)-    (4)&#13;
Defining the expected proportionate output change due to research as ht = H/Qo, and solving for H, gives:&#13;
Ht = ht QO. (5)&#13;
Substituting (5) into (4) and (3), and subsequently (4) into (3) results in:&#13;
Rt = PQ0(ht/e)(J+0.Sh,),         (6)&#13;
which is the change in economic surplus due to research in period t.&#13;

7.    For many commodities there is an expected change in output that is not due to research.  It is calculated&#13;
as Qt = Qo(1 +sf, where s denotes the trend growth parameter.  The exogenous output growth is the sum of the&#13;
growth rates of yield and area.  It either takes the value of zero (no growth) or different from zero (growth&#13;
expressed as an annual percentage change, which may be negative if the crop area is expected to decline). Then,&#13;
the change in total economic surplus is given by:&#13;
R, = PQn(1+s)'(h,/ f )(J+0.5h,.           (7)&#13;
8.    It is evident from (7) that supply elasticity plays an important role in the calculation of net returns. For&#13;
example, the use of a very small elasticity may erroneously inflate the benefits and give misleading results&#13;
regarding research priorities.  To avoid that error, we use £ = 1 for the "small open economy" commodities.&#13;
9.     The proportionate output change, h,, is a function of the following three factors:&#13;
(a)   Probability of research success, p.  This reflects the scientists' degree of certainty of obtaining the&#13;
projected yield. It varied between 60 and 85 percent in the base data.&#13;
(b)   Adoption rate, d,. This refers to the percentage of crop growers that will adopt the research&#13;
results.   With a few exceptions the adoption rate varies between 20 and 50 percent; the time&#13;
needed to attain the peak rate varies between three and five years.&#13;
(c)   Proportional change in yield, 4v.  This refers to a defined and maintained yield increase, given&#13;
that research is successfui.  It usually ranges between 10 and 40 percent above the average yield&#13;
estimated at the time the data were collected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
10.   Assuming independence amongp, dt, and Ay, the proportionate output change due to research is given by:&#13;
hi = Pdt Ay, (8)&#13;
Inserting (8) into (7) and the resulting expression into (1) and (2) gives the NPVB and ERR, which are functions&#13;
of measurable parameters.&#13;
A Numerical Exposition&#13;
11.    Data regarding prices and quantities refer to the average values of 1985/86 to 1989 /1990 period. Data&#13;
for probability of research success, adoption rate, expected proportional change in yield, and intensification (i.e.,&#13;
the parameters determining the expected increase in output) were collected from a survey over a period of three&#13;
months interviewing scientists, economists, and extension workers of the related research institutions.&#13;
Information on elasticities were collected from the economists of the respective institutions.&#13;
12.   To illustrate the calculation of the NPVB of a research project, consider the example of Boro rice. Costs&#13;
and revenues are calculated as follows:&#13;
(a)   Costs, C,: It is assumed that an additional Tk 132 million is spent on research in the first year&#13;
Tk 44 million in the second and third years, and Tk 11 million each year thereafter3.  Using a&#13;
discount rate of 12 percent (i.e., r = 0.12) gives a discounted present value of research costs of Tk&#13;
240 million. Multiplying that value by a marginal cost of public funds (MCPF) of 1.75 gives a&#13;
value of Tk420 million (column 3, Table A.4.1).&#13;
(b)   Revenues, R,: The probability of success was estimated to be 85 percent (i.e., p = 0.85). The&#13;
adoption rate is zero in the first year, increases by 5 percent in the two subsequent years and&#13;
remains constant at 20 percent in the years thereafter (i.e., d] = 0, d2 = 0.05, d3 = 0.10, and d4 =&#13;
0.20 for t &gt; 4). The research will result in a 7.5 percent pernanent change in yield (i.e., Ay =&#13;
0.075). Combining these parameters as in (8) gives the following profile for h,: h, = 0 (reflecting&#13;
the zero rate of adoption in the first year), h2 = 0.0032, h3 = 0.0064, h4 = 0.0128, and remaining&#13;
constant thereafter. Notice, however, that output still increases at the rate of one percent annually&#13;
thereafter (s = 0.01), resulting from gains in output not due to research. The elasticity of supply is&#13;
one (i.e., c = 1). Initial quantity and output price are: Qo = 7,084 thousand mt and P = 7,820&#13;
Tk/mt; the value of P is the projected real intemational price of rice in US dollars, converted to rice&#13;
at a milling rate of 0.65 and converted to Taka at the prevailing exchange rate. With a rate of&#13;
discount of 12 percent and a life-span of the research of 20 years (i.e., n = 20), the NPVB is&#13;
Tk3,901 million (column 4, Table A.4.1) and the ERR is 119.2% % (column 5, Table A.4.1).&#13;
Results and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
13.   Tables A.4.1 and A.4.2 report results for 35 commodities that contribute roughly 95 percent of&#13;
agricultural GDP. The commodities in Table A.4.1 are the responsibility of BRRI, FRI, BLRI, BFRI, BJRI, and&#13;
SRI, while the commodities in Table A.4.2 are the responsibility of BARI. The base case NPVs are mainly&#13;
positive at the discount rate of 12%. The ERRs range from 6% (maize, a very minor crop) to 11-12% (riverine&#13;
3This cost figure does not include the economic costs caused by taxation to raise the funds needed to finance the research.&#13;

and marine fisheries and jute) to 119% (boro rice) to even higher values for some minor spice crops. With the&#13;
exception of maize, the ERR to research on BARI crops is always greater than 20%. The NPVB of research&#13;
across all ARIs is US$1,090.5 million and the ERR of total research spending is 53.4 % (Table A.4.3).&#13;
14.   Ex-ante estimates of retums to research are notoriously sensitive to the initial assumptions on which the&#13;
calculations are based. Three key parameters in the estimates are the average price of the good, the probability&#13;
of research success and the time needed for farner adoption of the new technology. To examine the sensitivity of&#13;
the results to mean price, the probability of success, and adoption time we ran three additional simulations.&#13;
(a)    The NPVB of benefits at lower average prices.  The 1985/86 to 1989/90 average price was&#13;
used in the base scenario. In a first sensitivity analysis, the NPVs were recalculated at 75% of&#13;
that average price (Table A.4.1, "25 % lower base price"). At the base price minus 25%, all&#13;
NPVs remain positive except that of maize in BARI, and jute, riverine fisheries, and marine&#13;
fisheries in the other ARls.&#13;
(b)    Probability of Research Success Causing Zero NPVB.  The second simulation involved&#13;
calculation of the probability of success under the assumption that the NPVB of the research&#13;
project is zero.  Because of the independence assumption regarding the factors determining the&#13;
proportional cost reduction term h,, this exercise applies similarly to yield change and the rate of&#13;
adoption.   Results are reported in Table A.4.1 and Table A.4.2.  For Boro rice a probability&#13;
of failure of 0.92 is required to drive the base NPVB to zero. That is, any probability of success&#13;
lower than 0.08 (i.e., 1-0.92) makes the research project unprofitable. In 18 of 35 commodities,&#13;
the probabilities of success would have to be less than or equal to 0.1 to make research on the&#13;
commodity unprofitable. Only in maize (probability of success of 1.17) and jute (0.94) are the&#13;
success probabilities much higher4.&#13;
(c)    NPVB if adoption and generation of research results is slow. A significant factor affecting the&#13;
returns to agricultural research is the time elapsed from the beginning of the research to the&#13;
moment when farmers have adopted the new technology.  Delays in project implementation--&#13;
caused, for example, by the unavailability of recurrent cost funding after the initial fixed&#13;
investments have been made--can cause this time to grow and hence delay the availability of&#13;
benefits from research.  The base model includes an adoption delay and, in the sensitivity&#13;
analysis, we have extended that delay further.  This was done by reducing the numbers of&#13;
farmers adopting new technologies in each commodity annually by 25%. This is shown as the&#13;
"25% longer adoption time in Tables A.4.1 and A.4.2. While the estimated NPVBs with&#13;
extended delays in project implementation are lower than without, they remain highly positive.&#13;
15.   For the commodities under the responsibility of BARI (Table A.4.2), the measures give different priority&#13;
rankings. Potato, sweet potato, and wheat receive the highest priority according to the Base NPVB. According&#13;
to the ERR criterion, while sweet potato is ranked first, onion, chili, and turmeric are the ones that follow.&#13;
16.   Table A.4.3 reports aggregate costs and benefits for all seven research institutes involved in the lending&#13;
operation. The most profitable research investments are at BRRI, BARI and BLRI.&#13;
4Note that it follows from equation (7) that the switching values of prices and adoption time would be exactly the same as those for the&#13;
probability of research success.&#13;

AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
6. The Policy Environment and Institutional Issues&#13;
I. The Policy Environment&#13;
I.    The policy environment has changed greatly in most Asian nations in recent years, and in&#13;
most cases for the better in so far as opportunities for technological advance are concerned. Some&#13;
of the reforms relating to market liberalization have yet to be fully played out, but there has been&#13;
laudable progress in many cases, including Bangladesh. Distortions relative to world prices are&#13;
now relatively minor for most inputs important to Bangladesh agriculture and for most farm&#13;
products.&#13;
2.     Further reforms can be expected through growing government commitment, through&#13;
assistance past and present provided by some bilateral donors such as USAID, and the on-going&#13;
activities under the Agricultural Services Support Project of IDA and GOB. These will include&#13;
development of stronger protection of intellectual property, further privatization of the seed&#13;
industry and gradual diminution of government (largely through BADC) involvement in marketing&#13;
of agricultural inputs and products. Enhanced IPRs will facilitate local design and manufacture of&#13;
agricultural equipment and machines, local R&amp;D on veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines,&#13;
and crop improvement for specialty crops such as vegetables, fruits, cotton and spices and&#13;
medicinal plants, where there is already considerable private activity in some cases, especially for&#13;
hybrids. Such work will hopefully include private-sector development of hybrid rice. Several&#13;
mechanisms to foster the development of private-sector support to research are proposed in this&#13;
Project.&#13;
3.     The key aspects of the policy environment concerning agricultural research rest in what&#13;
might be depicted as the attitudes of GOB towards agricultural technology development. These&#13;
attitudes have two broad components, namely private and public.&#13;
4.     Private-sector research. There has been some progress in this field in Bangladesh, but&#13;
many opportunities lie neglected. In some cases the major impediment seems to be the dominance&#13;
of public involvement, such as in jute processing, and the consequent inertia for innovation and&#13;
new-product development. Regulatory intrusions in sugar processing, with their consequent&#13;
distortions of incentives, provide similar obstacles in that industry. Notwithstanding the population&#13;
of greater than 115 million, Bangladesh is a small market for agricultural inputs, which doubtless&#13;
discourages local R&amp;D activities by transnational corporations, and leads to direct importation of&#13;
technologies that seem more or less appropriate locally. The effective market size is set by the&#13;
dominance of the small-scale farmers in the sector, and their limited involvement in other than&#13;
subsistence agriculture. Private-sector initiatives , to the extent that they are successful will thus&#13;
be of most value to the commercial farm and processing sectors.&#13;
&#13;

5.     Public-sector research. The structure of agriculture in Bangladesh, together with the&#13;
public-good nature of much research of relevance to improving its productivity, means that the&#13;
public sector will be obliged to play the major role in overall R&amp;D. This has long been recognized&#13;
by GOB, as reflected in the creation of the NARS as it is today. The key question is: Does the&#13;
recognition go far enough? The short answer seems to be: No. The organizational and incentive&#13;
issues discussed below and throughout this SAR are ample testimony to the fact that the&#13;
government has not seen fit to address seriously the productivity of the system, its morale, its&#13;
continuing attrition of expensively trained senior scientific staff, and thus its tragically reduced&#13;
contribution to national development. If one of BARC's primary purposes was to have convinced&#13;
policy-makers in Bangladesh of the real value of a productive NARS, it seems to have failed.&#13;
Maybe the task is impossible, but the intention in this Project is to tackle the central managerial&#13;
impediments to efficiency.&#13;
11. Organizational Problems&#13;
6.     Several organizational themes are taken up: centralization, financial administration,&#13;
priority-setting implementation, and doing a better job with key clients.&#13;
7.     Centralization.  The trend in Asia over the past three decades has been for greater&#13;
centralization of research through various institutional arrangements, especially the formation of an&#13;
"apex" agricultural research council to oversee a system of semi-autonomous national research&#13;
organizations, and featuring the establishment of national coordinated programs.&#13;
8.     The major purposes of the apex research organizations have been several-fold:&#13;
(a)    To develop national research strategies and plans for the research system or&#13;
particular components of it.&#13;
(b)    To provide visibility and intended political protection to research, and to help link&#13;
research to broader agricultural policy discussions.&#13;
(c)    To coordinate external linkages, especially with donors, and also with the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
(d)    To focus and coordinate research across research institutions.&#13;
(e)    To develop quality standards for human-resource development and support,&#13;
external research reviews, etc.&#13;
9.     In some cases, apex organizations have been charged with research planning and&#13;
coordination, without controls over funds that are sufficient to enable effective coordination.&#13;
Bangladesh, through its creation of BARC, has done well on (a), (b) and (c) at various times since&#13;
its creation. Achievements under (d) have been less impressive, in part because of limitations on&#13;
the scope of the institutions directly under its wing, and the related lack of direct control over&#13;
funding that derives from ministries other than BARC's own. For a different set of reasons,&#13;
progress on (e) has also been modest to date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 7&#13;
10.   It is not unknown for an apex organization for whatever reason-bureaucratic power&#13;
plays, changing leadership personalities, undermining by donors-not to sustain comprehensive&#13;
and effective apex powers and responsibilities. Bangladesh is a case in point. Such powers must,&#13;
in an important sense, be earned through generated respect and then protected under cogent&#13;
legislation by the relevant ministries. When such conditions do not pertain, conceptual re-design is&#13;
indicated, as is the case in mid-1995.  Since BARC is being accorded central oversight&#13;
responsibilities in the Project, it is vital to the success of the Project that it retain/regain/acquire, as&#13;
may be the case, the ability to deliver the several central services of: overall strategic planning;&#13;
intellectual underpinning of and facilitation of the implementation of priority setting generally in&#13;
Bangladesh agricultural research and specifically in the ARIs under its mandated responsibility.&#13;
11.    One rationale for centralization of research in national coordinated programs is the&#13;
potential for economies of size in research. Several factors may lead to such economies of size.&#13;
These include: (a) Increasing marginal returns- especially at early stages of an investment&#13;
program; (b) Fixed costs of research- most research programs require certain minimum&#13;
establishment costs in the form of research stations, laboratories and equipment, library resources&#13;
and administrative overheads; (c) Specialization of scientific expertise and equipment; (d) Team&#13;
interaction-for some types of research problems, researchers working in a team are more&#13;
productive than the sum of individual researchers working alone. Other factors tend to work in the&#13;
opposite direction, leading to a tendency for diseconomies of size (especially) and sometimes also&#13;
scope. The end result is then an empirical matter of which forces predominate. Just where the&#13;
Bangladesh ARIs fall in this regard at the present is an excellent empirical question, but anecdotal&#13;
evidence on the degree of central control and influence being imposed on even the adaptive research&#13;
efforts would suggest that centralization per se within the institutes may have gone rather too far&#13;
already. The Project will thus have to tread a fine line in supporting and strengthening the&#13;
centralized planning, review and monitoring functions in BARC while at the same time facilitating&#13;
the development of devolved responsibilities in regional research units (such as BARI's regional&#13;
research stations) whereby research workers are able to be more responsive to locally identified&#13;
needs and opportunities. At another level, the management of research funds for expenditures in&#13;
stations distant from HQ needs enhanced local capability and responsibility, as is taken up in the&#13;
following section.&#13;
12.    Priority-setting implementation. The lack of transparent mechanisms for allocating&#13;
research resources within a NARS has been frequently noted. As a result, many NARSs tend to&#13;
lack focus, and resource allocation across problems, commodities and regions is often inconsistent&#13;
with either efficiency or equity goals. At the same time, methods for research priority setting have&#13;
evolved rapidly and are now generally regarded as providing necessary information to decision&#13;
makers for allocation of research resources. As such, it must be reiterated that such methods are&#13;
tools that inform decisions-not that replace them or those who make them.&#13;
13.   In the past decade, many NARSs have undertaken priority-setting exercises and introduced&#13;
more formal methods into evaluation of research projects prior to funding, and Bangladesh has&#13;
been to the fore in such developments, with assistance from ISNAR and financial support of&#13;
USAID. The follow-up work planned for 1993 involving FAO CP has been long delayed, and may&#13;
ultimately prove useful in the context of further development of institutional capacity in the area of&#13;
scarce research resource allocation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 4 of 7&#13;
14.    Despite the proliferation of priority-setting exercises, such as that of June 1992 for&#13;
Bangladesh (and its various subsequent revisions), the impact on research efficiency and funding&#13;
has been less than anticipated. Several reasons account for this:&#13;
These various issues are being addressed in the ARMP as central to the success of the Project.&#13;
15.    Client orientation.  Improved priority setting provides a macro-level framework for&#13;
allocating research resources among regions and commodities, but does not improve the content of&#13;
research to address high-priority farmers' problems. Thus priority setting from the macro-level&#13;
must be complemented by "bottom-up" approaches to research planning.&#13;
16.    Beginning in the 1970s, there was a growing awareness of the lack of relevance of much&#13;
agricultural research to the needs of the major immediate clients of the research system -resource-&#13;
poor farmers. Failure to involve the main users in the research process led to two types of&#13;
inefficiencies: (a) an imbalance between the supply of and the demand for technology, and&#13;
(b) exclusion of an important source of innovations - the farmers themselves.&#13;
17.    This led to a strong emphasis on farming systems and on-farm research during the decade&#13;
of the 1980s. The major contribution of this movement was to provide methods for diagnosing&#13;
farmers' problems, setting research priorities to address those problems and screening potential&#13;
technologies for their relevance to small-scale farmers' circumstances. In recent years, more&#13;
participatory methods have been developed that seek to really involve farmers in defining the actual&#13;
content and design of experiments. All of this has, of course, implied considerable investment of&#13;
researchers' time in working directly with farmers, including experimentation in farmers' fields, all&#13;
to the good in the quest for relevance.&#13;
18.   In Bangladesh, as in many other countries, the World Bank (along with bilateral donors)&#13;
supported this movement strongly through the inclusion in most NARS investment projects of some&#13;
type of component for FSR or adaptive research, using methods of on-farm diagnosis and&#13;
experimentation.&#13;
19.    These methods have, however, had only partial success, as measured by a faster rate of&#13;
adoption of technologies by farmers. Difficulties have been experienced in many cases -and such&#13;
is the situation in contemporary Bangladesh -through focusing on distinct research units to&#13;
conduct FSR rather than trying to introduce a farming systems perspective at all levels of the&#13;
research system. Such an organizational approach amounts to bureaucratic marginalization of the&#13;
adaptive farmer-problem-oriented research work, while the "mainstream" research service can&#13;
continue in traditional mode. Other problems have included:&#13;
(a)    Lack of sufficiently productive technologies "on the shelf' to adapt.&#13;
(b)    Inadequate links between research, extension and policy, so that research&#13;
recommendations often have not reached farmers, or were not adopted because of&#13;
lack of effective access to inputs.&#13;
(c)    Difficulties of feeding back information from farmers to define priorities for&#13;
applied and strategic research. The considerable challenge inherent in such work&#13;
should not be understated. In many cases, however, this has reflected the absence&#13;
of linkage mechanisms to the separately-undertaken priority-setting and planning&#13;
exercises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 5 of 7&#13;
(d)    The voluntary nature of the process that depended on altruism and insight of&#13;
researchers rather than direct pressure from farmers to influence the research&#13;
agenda.&#13;
20.    The next major steps toward greater client orientation in research systems will probably&#13;
have to involve more direct pressure from clients on research organization through the&#13;
strengthening of farmer organizations, which have been the main pressure groups for agricultural&#13;
research in more-developed countries. Farmer organizations can, in principle, exert pressure&#13;
though three mechanisms:&#13;
(a)    Through the political system, in appropriation of government revenues for&#13;
agricultural research;&#13;
(b)    Through the participation of representatives of farmer organizations on governing&#13;
boards and research review committees of research institutions. While farmers&#13;
have benefits included on such boards in Bangladesh, they have not been&#13;
representative of all research clients;&#13;
(c)    Through funding agricultural research. This might involve farmers contributing&#13;
from their own resources or by raising funds from other sources. Opportunities for&#13;
such operations in Bangladesh are probably confined to shrimp farning and some&#13;
special crop sub-sectors such as sugarcane and cotton and, through product&#13;
processing, jute and kenaf.&#13;
21.    Although there is much potential for the role of farmer organizations, it should also be&#13;
recognized that effective organizations typically only exist in less-developed countries for some&#13;
commercial and export-oriented crops. Thus the development of farmer organizations with&#13;
effective technical, managerial and political skills to represent the mass of small-scale farmers is a&#13;
challenging task that will take much time to accomplish, but should be addressed within this&#13;
Project along with the proposed study of funding possibilities from the private sector.&#13;
22.    In sum, attempts to build a farming systems perspective pervasively into the Bangladesh&#13;
agricultural research system can make important contributions to the relevance of many types of&#13;
research. The limitations of this approach without some fonn of farmer empowerment must,&#13;
however, be recognized. The adoption of a such a client orientation in less-developed-country&#13;
agricultural research systems such as that of Bangladesh thus has far to go before reality matches&#13;
the rhetoric.  This Project provides the opportunity to learn from  past misadventures, in&#13;
Bangladesh and elsewhere, and to move forward on several innovative fronts to activate genuine&#13;
farmer participation in FSR, and to invoke genuine institute-wide support for such problem-&#13;
oriented applied R&amp;D.&#13;
&#13;

III. Human Resource Issues&#13;
23.    Perhaps the most important element in strengthening NARSs such as that of Bangladesh is&#13;
to strengthen the management of the human resource base. Some recent evidence that the quality of&#13;
the human resource base may be declining is grcat cause for alarm. Problems of human resource&#13;
management include:&#13;
(a)    Declining operating support (down to about 5 percent of total operating&#13;
expenditures in some ARls. e.g., BJRI) and salaries (already understandablv low),&#13;
which reduces morale and provides incentives for the best scientists to leave for&#13;
the private sector or international/foreign organizations.  Project support for&#13;
research operating costs should case this situation in the short run, although&#13;
increased revenue budgeting by GOB is required for a sust-Linable solution;&#13;
(b)    Rigid zivil service rules that evaluate and reward researchers according to&#13;
seniority rather than merit, and in some Bangladeshi cases also impose the&#13;
confining strictures of promotion only from "within," and recruitment from&#13;
essentially but a single source, leading inevitably to severe "inbreeding."&#13;
(c)    Lack of development of a "science culture" that encourages inquiry. In particular,&#13;
relatively few scientists are given real opportunities beyond their graduate studies&#13;
to seriously practice science. Many find themselves as either research cum&#13;
administrative assistants for more senior scientists, or more commonly, are rapidly&#13;
promoted into administrative posts. In far too many Bangladeshi cases, many such&#13;
''promotions" are implemented on an "acting" basis that has persisted for&#13;
years-sometimes many-in the process compromising confidence and authority,&#13;
diminishing commitment and achievement, and surely reducing research-system&#13;
productivity.&#13;
(d)    In part because of such difficulties, it is increasingly common to find a lack of real&#13;
accountability on the part of scientists and research managers, whether measured&#13;
in terms of research products or the adoption of those products by farmers. Few&#13;
NARSs, and regrettably Bangladesh is among them, appear to have good&#13;
mechanisms for personnel evaluation.&#13;
24.    Management options to increase the effectiveness of utilization of human resources&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)    Revamping of the reward and promotion system, including regular and serious&#13;
staff appraisal, so that it explicitly recognizes and defines merit, and allowing&#13;
research scientists the opportunity for salary benefits and prestige equivalent to&#13;
that enjoyed by managers and administrators. Such arrangements are sometimes&#13;
known as "science service schemes" and, while widely in place in more-developed&#13;
countries, seem to have a deserving place also in countries such as Bangladesh.&#13;
One of the problems in this particular case is that, even where such administrative&#13;
procedures are in place, as in the autonomous ARls, there has been a reluctance to&#13;
use them for fear of complaints from those perceived to be disadvantaged relative&#13;
to their rights under traditional seniority systems, sometimes translated into court&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -                                   Annex 6&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
actions that incur their own high costs. Such reluctance must be addressed fully&#13;
frontally in this Project.&#13;
(b)    Direct training may have a role to play, particularly in those situations where&#13;
appointed managers do not have a comprehensive background in the relevant&#13;
skills. For some, the major needs will be in key skills in human-resource&#13;
management and development. For others, the training priorities may be more in&#13;
the areas of project planning, proposal writing and project management. These&#13;
will be supported by the Project.&#13;
(c)    Facilitation of and approval for outside consultancies to boost earnings and obtain&#13;
widcr and hopefully helpful experience. A scnsible balance is clearly required in&#13;
such provisions if, indeed, "local" productivity is to be significantly and&#13;
sustainably  boosted.   A  further (often under-stated'  advantage of such&#13;
consultancies is that they can serve as efficient vehicles for transfers of&#13;
technc' 3gies, institutions and even policies.&#13;
25.    One type of external activity worthy of special mention is participation in external reviews.&#13;
Because of their careful preparation and tight schedules, these provide excellent structured learning&#13;
situations for reviewers, even though this is not, of course, a primary intention in their conduct.&#13;
Needless to say, the major immnediate beneficiaries of such reviews are the reviewed themselves. It&#13;
may often be the case that they gain most of the benefit, because of the discipline of having to&#13;
organize for the review, including the articulation of a rationale for what has been done and what is&#13;
planned, rather than necessarily from any insight carried in by the external reviewers.&#13;
26.    In small agricultural research systems where managers are closely familiar with institute&#13;
personnel, their professional development needs, their achievements and their frustrations, there&#13;
may not be a strong requirement for formal monitoring and evaluation procedures to assist&#13;
decisions in the human-resource domain. Otherwise, however, and Bangladesh's system can&#13;
hardly be regarded as small, such procedures and their related information systems will be vital to&#13;
the smooth and effective implementation of human-resource options such as those canvassed above&#13;
and accordingly are embedded in the Project.&#13;

7. Supervision Plan and Reporting Formats&#13;
I. Supervision Plan&#13;
1.    The proposed operation is institutionally complex and supervision will be close. A project launch&#13;
workshop, to be held immediately after effectiveness, will review planned budget and implementation of the&#13;
first year. Subsequently, two formal IDA supervisions will be held each year. The first supervision will&#13;
focus on the Annual Review of progress to be submitted to IDA before March 31 of each year. The second&#13;
supervision will review the annual budget and work plan and will be held no later than September 30 of&#13;
each year. Both supervisions will include visits to research sites, farms, and other activities supported by&#13;
the project. Local supervision, done by consultants contracted by BARC, will complement the formal&#13;
supervisions.&#13;
2.    The supervision calendar is as follows:&#13;
(a)    Project launch workshop, fourth quarter FY96: Focus: budget and implementation in&#13;
1996, including research plans, development of the management information system, staff&#13;
training, and technical assistance; procurement, disbursement, and budget of the executing&#13;
agencies.&#13;

4.     Contracting local supervision. The credit includes resources to contract qualified local&#13;
consultants for supervision. BARC will prepare generic terms of reference for supervision consultancies,&#13;
including, inter alia, report format, preparation of the agreed project implementation indicators, and use of&#13;
the Form 590. At the annual review, to be held each year in March, supervision needs will be defined and a&#13;
short list of consultants will be prepared by BARC in light of those needs. IDA will review and approve&#13;
the shortlist. BARC will then hire individual consultants using IDA Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.&#13;

AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
8. Policy for Completing Institutional Reforms of&#13;
the National Agricultural Research System&#13;
1.    The Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh has developed a comprehensive&#13;
national agricultural research strategy. The main objective of the strategy is to enable a sustained&#13;
increase in agricultural production and employment, in all sub-sectors, through research and&#13;
extension leading to widespread technical change that promotes both efficiency and equity in the&#13;
use of resources. In furtherance of this objective, it has prepared an Agricultural Research&#13;
Management Project (ARMP), to be funded partially by the Intemational Development Association&#13;
(IDA). The Government has discussed the strategy with IDA and believes that it and IDA are in&#13;
substantial agreement about the analysis and recommcndations for agricultural research in&#13;
Bangladesh.&#13;
2.    In its strategy, the Govenmment is committed to strengthening the national agricultural&#13;
research system with the following characteristics: (1) relevant research producing clearly&#13;
measurable benefits; (2) effective governance and strong accountability for results; (3) flexible and&#13;
efficient resource allocation; (4) reward to personal initiative to foster creative scientific enterprise;&#13;
(5) adequate, stable and diversified funding; and (6) a significant role for the private sector in the&#13;
long run. The strategy recognizes certain institutional problems, however, that prevent full&#13;
expression of these characteristics. While the Govemment has pursued some reforms to date, more&#13;
institutional changes are required. In this letter, the Govemment states its commitment to further&#13;
institutional reforms promoting a more efficient research system.&#13;
3.     The Govemment has considered alternative means for reform. It now believes that greater&#13;
autonomy for the ARls, allowing more independence in management and a more effective&#13;
stakeholder participation in their governance, are necessary to achieve these reforms and thereby&#13;
to attain the objective of its agricultural research strategy. The Government's policy recognizes&#13;
the necessity of adequate public financial support to agricultural research in the foreseeable future.&#13;
4.     During the implementation of the ARMP, the Government intends to complete the&#13;
following actions in pursuit of the necessary institutional changes.&#13;
(a)    Broader rule-making power would be given to the ARIs in the areas of personnel,&#13;
budget, and management.&#13;
(b)    The ARIs would receive greater freedom in personnel management.&#13;
(c)    The funding of the ARIs would consist of block grants given by the Government,&#13;
complemented by additional monies from other sources.&#13;
(d)    The governing bodies of the ARIs would be reconstituted to allow greater&#13;
participation by producers and other non-government entities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
(e)    The Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC) would continue to be the&#13;
Government's primary instrument for further development of the agricultural&#13;
research strategy, allocation and use of the block grants, monitoring of&#13;
expenditures, the quality of research to be undertaken, and of results obtained.&#13;
(f)    A full inventory of the staff and property of the ARIs.&#13;
5.    The Government recognizes the inherent difficulties in these actions. It accordingly will&#13;
name a full-time official coordinator to implement them. With the assistance of the ARMP, it&#13;
intends to complete these steps by no later than the mid-term review of the ARMP. The&#13;
Government intends to undertake a mid-term review of the ARMP, jointly with the Bank, and to&#13;
take corrective measures on the basis of that review.&#13;

            Bangladesh - Agricultural Research
            Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Agricultural
            Research Management Project is to increase the efficiency of
            the national agricultural research system and thereby to
            generate profitable, relevant, and sustainable agricultural
            technologies for Bangladeshi agricultural producers. The
            components of the project are as follows: 1) research
            management and organization, which will strengthen
            managerial capabilities of Bangladesh Agricultural Research
            Council (BARC) through carrying out of institutional
            reforms, improved economic analysis of research programs,
            technical assistance, construction and rehabilitation of
            civil works, training, contract research, and supervision of
            new master plans for participating Agricultural Research
            Institutes (ARIs); 2) priority research, which will be
            carried out in the ARIs on crops, fisheries, livestock and
            forestry; and 3) participating farming systems research,
            which will strengthen farming systems research programs
            through support to research-extension linkages and testing
            and dissemination of appropriate technology.
