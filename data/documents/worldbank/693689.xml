Natural Gas Markets in the U.K.&#13;
Competition, industry structure, and market power of the incumbent&#13;
AndreJ Jurls      The deregulation of the U.K. natural gas industry has facilitated new entry and competition in&#13;
almost all segments of the industry except pipeline transportation. The new regulatory&#13;
framework, developed largely by the Office of Gas Regulation (Ofgas), has allowed market forces&#13;
to stimulate a variety of specialized services and market transactions to meet customer needs.&#13;
But the entire process has been difficult because of a flaw in the initial industry structure: the&#13;
government privatized British Gas as a vertically integrated company. The U.K. experience shows&#13;
that leaving gas supply integrated with pipeline transportation and tying up gas in long-term&#13;
contracts impede competition. This Note reviews the U.K. reform and the development of new&#13;
spot, on-system, and "Flexibility Mechanism" markets.&#13;

trading, shipping, and supply can emerge over-&#13;
night and introduce new methods of transacting&#13;
business, such as spot market trading. By con-&#13;
centrating trading in one location, spot markets&#13;
like the U.K. on-system market can serve a vital&#13;
function for market participants that require flex-&#13;
ibility in gas supply and efficient pricing of natu-&#13;
ral gas. And spot market pricing of natural gas&#13;
can be used for valuation-of system balancing,&#13;
as it is in the Flexibility Mechanism of BG.&#13;
Categories of market participants are defined in the Network Code&#13;
of BG plc, the pipeline transportation spin-off of British Gas. Ship-&#13;
pers are firms with shipper licenses that buy gas from producers,&#13;
sell it to suppliers, and contract with BG to transport the gas to&#13;
consumers. Supplicrs are firms with supplicr licenscs that buy gas&#13;
from shippers and then sell it to consumers. They do not deal&#13;
directly with producers or BG. Since many companies in the United&#13;
Kingdom have both supplier and shipper licenses, these terms&#13;
are used interchangeably here. Traders are firms that buy and sell&#13;
natural gas in a spot market and do not deal directly with con-&#13;
sumers or BG.&#13;

            Natural gas markets in the U.K. -
            competition, industry structure, and market power of the incumbent
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The deregulation of the U.K. natural gas
            industry has facilitated new entry and competition in almost
            all segments of the industry except pipeline transportation.
            The new regulatory framework, developed largely by the
            Office of Gas Regulation (Ofgas), has allowed market forces
            to stimulate a variety of specialized services and market
            transactions to meet customer needs.  But the entire process
            has been difficult because of a flaw in the initial industry
            structure: the government privatized British Gas as a
            vertically integrated company.  The U. K. experience shows
            that leaving gas supply integrated with pipeline
            transportation and tying up gas in long-term contracts
            impede competition.  This Note reviews the U.K. reform and
            the development of new spot, on-system, and
            "Flexibility Mechanism" markets.
