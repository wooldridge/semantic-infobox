&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: I'm David Hopper, or William David Hopper, to be entirely formal. I grew up in a&#13;
family where you call everybody by their second name rather than the first name. Born on&#13;
February 22 nd , 1927. Today is April the 2nd , 2004. I was born in Ottawa, Canada, and I'm still a&#13;
Canadian.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: You never became a U.S. citizen?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: No. I've been a long-term permanent resident of the United States. Someday I'll&#13;
get around to citizenship, but ...&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Okay. It looks like we're registering just fine.&#13;
&#13;
So today what I thought we'd do is start with some of the background information on you and&#13;
move into your work in India in the '60s and the [Bernard R.] Bell Mission and then up through&#13;
the '70s. Then I thought we'd possibly stop there, and then the second interview we would move&#13;
into your work.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Do you want to shut that off just for a minute, and I'll introduce you, too?&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Sure. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption1&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: So you said you were born in Ottawa.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Canada.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Canada. And what were your parents' names and their occupations?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: My father was Wilbert Clayton Hopper, called Bert. My mother was Eva Louella&#13;
Hill, the maiden name. My father was an agriculturalist, first degree in agriculture, and then he&#13;
moved to do his master's in agronomy and his Ph.D. at Cornell [University] in agricultural&#13;
economics. I spent my first years of my life--they went down to Ithaca, New York, and Cornell&#13;
when I was one and a half. He then joined the faculty at Cornell and started to work for USDA&#13;
[U.S. Department of Agriculture], returned to Canada in 1938. My mother was a contralto&#13;
soloist and then became very active in building houses and real estate. My father died in 1965.&#13;
My mother died in 1986. My father had ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, when he died. They're&#13;
buried in a family burial plot up in Ottawa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
My father, the last years in his life, was, worked in Australia and then was high commissioner--&#13;
which is the equivalent of ambassador in the British Commonwealth system--high commissioner&#13;
to New Zealand and then came down here to Washington and spent the last ten years of his&#13;
activity in Washington at the Canadian embassy.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Okay. So that would have been '55 through '65?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: This was--no. He retired in '59 from the Canadian foreign service.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: Okay. Well, it's interesting: [know that you also went to Cornell and got your&#13;
Ph.D. in agricultural economics.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: And cultural anthropology.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: So was it a double?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: It was a double major.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: Double major. Let me ask you how much your father influenced you on going&#13;
into that, that field.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: A bit, but not--I grew up playing around with white rats, earning money producing&#13;
white rats down in the basement, which was a very stinky business.&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAULT: And what were the rats for?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: I sold them to the National Research Council. They were genetically pure lines, and&#13;
the National Research Council bought them at fifty cents a rat, which was a lot of money in those&#13;
days, which I then invested in radios. I was a radio amateur. I never got on the air because the&#13;
war broke out in 1939 in Canada, and 1 was banned. But I had a deep interest in radios and was&#13;
determined to be a radio engineer. I spent some time at the edge of the Canadian artillery and so&#13;
on.&#13;
&#13;
But when the German--the Second World War kind of broke up, I found I was out of high school&#13;
without really a proper high school diploma. I went to work in Toronto for a pollster outfit. I&#13;
got interested in the fact that one of the polls I had to do was down in the wine growing area, the&#13;
Niagara escarpment, which creates Niagara Falls. It's a big rock rise at the end of Lake Ontario,&#13;
and I found myself involved in what they could do with the land, the farm areas, orchard areas,&#13;
under the Niagara escarpment. Got interested in that, decided that the firm 1 was with was&#13;
unlikely to survive (I was wrong), but I didn't--and pressure from family, you know: "Go get&#13;
yourself a degree somewhere." And so 1 went to--tried Ontario Agricultural College, where my&#13;
father graduated from back in 1920. And they were very kind, but I wasn't interested in the&#13;
course work. I found ..&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAULT: Why not?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       3&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: There wasn't enough science in it. It was--you moved in and you studied bee-&#13;
keeping and you studied vegetable growing and you studied this and you studied that. But my&#13;
radio things had put me--during my period in high school, for example, the physics teacher in&#13;
high school refused to teach anything on electronics if I was sitting in the classroom. I taught it.&#13;
This was part of it.&#13;
&#13;
But I went to McGill University. I took a B.S.C. in agriculture. But the first two years in that is&#13;
physics, mathematics, chemistry, and so on. I found this very, very suitable. And the last two&#13;
years I studied economics and agricultural economics. Then I worked at Cornell one summer. I&#13;
worked in Saskatchewan another summer. I went to different places. And I went back to&#13;
Cornell to do a Ph.D.--well, to do my master's degree, actually.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: So you were only thinking master's at that time?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: I was only thinking master's at that time. It was 1950. And I got assigned to milk&#13;
marketing, and I worked in New York. I worked in New York one summer for milk marketing.&#13;
Another summer I toured Europe on behalf ofthe--Iooking at the activities ofthe reconstruction&#13;
of Europe. Was down in Italy, was impressed with the north Italians, had an Italian person who&#13;
was working with me or traveling with me. The north was booming, Milan, et cetera, and as we&#13;
moved south in Italy, it was, kept getting poorer and poorer. I had never seen such poverty as I&#13;
saw in Naples and this kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
And we were sitting in a cafe in Palermo down in Sicily, and I said to Luigi, "I don't understand&#13;
this. The north: booming economically. Down here: nothing. Same country, same language,&#13;
same history. What's the problem?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "It's simple, it's simple. In the north you have to have money to get power. Down here&#13;
you have to have power to get money." This was the home of the Mafia and so on. And that&#13;
kind of stuck in my mind for some time.&#13;
&#13;
I went to Cornell. This had occurred before I got to Cornell; it was in '49. I went to Cornell and&#13;
got into milk marketing and decided that that isn't really what I wanted to do. And in the course&#13;
of this, I worked with a man by the name of Forrest [Frosty] Hill, who was the head of ag&#13;
economics at Cornell, one of my mentors, and he asked me what I thought was the most&#13;
important thing in agriculture, global agriculture, over the course of the next twenty years. I said&#13;
I didn't know. So he sent me offto read Frank Notestein, who was a demographer at Princeton&#13;
[University] and so on. And it was quite clear that the demographers had taken a look at this.&#13;
Notestein had, particularly, had taken a look at what occurred in our society, Western culture, as&#13;
medicine improved and as our ability to handle things like smallpox and so on increased, and as&#13;
incomes increased, that the numbers of children born into families was increasing and there was&#13;
a population expansion, that birth issues before that, were pretty much forty per thousand for&#13;
women/children and death rates were about forty per thousand, and we had a stability. Then&#13;
suddenly death rates began to drop, but birth rates were culturally determined, and they stayed&#13;
high, up at the forty per thousand, and you had a population expansion. And what was now clear&#13;
was that the medical capabilities, our capabilities to handle death rates, was moving to the&#13;
developing countries increasingly, and birth rates were culturally determined and remained high,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and that you're going to have a major expansion and a demographic transition before the birth&#13;
rates would begin to drop.&#13;
&#13;
One of the places that had always interested me as a kid and so on, I used to read about India,&#13;
British India. This seemed to apply to all of this, so I decided, in a discussion with Hill, to drop&#13;
my milk marketing and pursue to a master's degree and to move over into taking a look at some&#13;
other things. I went down and studied politics, political science, anthropology, did some work in&#13;
law and slopped around the campus a bit.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: So it was very multi-disciplinary.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: It was a multi-disciplinary search. And at the end of six months, I came and began&#13;
to discuss all of this again with Hill. We decided that cultural anthropology and agricultural&#13;
economics would mix. I did some work in soils, and I did some work in some other areas.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: Now let me just interrupt you here for one second. It's interesting because&#13;
economics and anthropology have not always been the best of friends as disciplines.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: I'll tell you about that in a minute. All right?&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Okay. Good.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: With anthropology, I went out and worked among the Navajo Indians and the&#13;
Papago Indians out in the West and took a look at the work that Ruth Benedict and a series of&#13;
others were doing in anthropology and found myself kind of deeply engrossed in anthropology.&#13;
The decision was made that I should not do a master's degree but go directly for a Ph.D., and I&#13;
got a Social Science Research Council grant to go live in India.&#13;
&#13;
So I went and lived in a Village. There was a man from this village who was a student at Cornell,&#13;
and it was his village I went to. The anthropology department of Cornell had a substantial grant&#13;
from the Social Science Research Council and from other sources to do work in Peru and in .&#13;
Thailand and in India. So I had those connections. And I went off and lived in this village in&#13;
India, a remote part of India, not--it's an agricultural part. It's close to Benares. I was thirty&#13;
miles from Benares and so on.&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAUL T: Can you remember the name of it?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Oh, yeah, the village was called Senapur. It was in Kerakat tehsil and Jaunpur&#13;
district. Jaunpur was an old Muslim area, but this was a Hindu village. And it was a very&#13;
interesting thing. It was in the interior. It was four miles to the nearest road and six miles to the&#13;
nearest market town. I lived there for two years. I was married and had my first wife. She was&#13;
a nurse, so I was known as Dr. Sabb's [phonetic] husband because she kind of tended the people.&#13;
&#13;
I struggled with what I was finding, trying to relate culture and agriculture. I did some farming,&#13;
didn't know anything about rice but grew wheat. My first year growing wheat, I got it from the&#13;
best farmer in the village, used his animals. I lived in a house, and there's a connection between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                        5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the workers and the landlords, the purjans and the jajmans. The purjans connected with my&#13;
house did the work but [used] his animals, and I planted wheat. I had grown--my grandfather&#13;
was a farmer and so on, so I had grown up partly on a farm. I knew what all this was about, and&#13;
I did wheat. The understanding was that he was growing it in a field right beside mine, small&#13;
plots, and if! got a good yield, then he would take my wheat, and that was that. If! didn't make&#13;
at least what he got, then I'd pay him the difference. And the first year I paid him quite a bit. I&#13;
discovered that you plant wheat when it's warm in India, and then you wait until the ground&#13;
cools down enough. In Canada you plant wheat after the ground warms up enough. As my&#13;
grandfather said, "You have to feel it through the soles of your feet," and I didn't feel it properly.&#13;
&#13;
I then visited every research station across north India, all the agricultural research stations, and&#13;
found that they were not getting nearly the yield my farmer was getting.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Why was that?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Just the lack of-I mean, the research community was over here and they worked&#13;
amongst themselves and so on. They didn't bother looking out what was going on among the&#13;
agriculturalists. And I say the best farmer in the village. Look, there were farmers who were&#13;
making a half, some of them less than a half, of the yields he was getting. He was just a very,&#13;
very competent guy. The top twenty percent of the farmers were doing better than the&#13;
agricultural research stations were. I wrote Hill about this, and we debated it back and forth.&#13;
And I did some work otherwise.&#13;
&#13;
My father, I told you, was in the foreign service. The High Commissioner to India, a man by the&#13;
name of Escott Reid, was a good friend of my father's. He was a former professor at University&#13;
of Toronto. During the Second World War, there was quite a number of these people from&#13;
Toronto and many academic institutions who moved into Ottawa as part of the crew of building&#13;
the Canadian participation in the Second World War or World War II.&#13;
&#13;
Escott was there, and I visited Escott in Delhi, at both his request and per my father's suggestion:&#13;
"You ought to go down and say hello to Escott." So I did. Escott--I went down dressed in&#13;
basically Indian clothes, and Escott suggested that he'd like to give me a lunch for me, a whole&#13;
lunch for me. I went to lunch, and Pandit [Jawahadal] Nehru was at the lunch and S. K. Dube,&#13;
who was head of community development, was at the lunch, and a series of other people. Nehru&#13;
suggested--he was prime minister--Nehru suggested that I go visit his daughter in Allahabad. I&#13;
was seventy miles from Allahabad, and there's a big agricultural institute at Allahabad that was&#13;
founded by the churches here, particularly the Methodist and Presbyterian here in the United&#13;
States.&#13;
&#13;
I went down to Allahabad. I bought a motor bike and kind of traveled around. I was only twenty&#13;
miles from Sarnath, where Buddha preached his first sermon. I spent some time over there,&#13;
beautiful old temples. It was the Ashokan capital back in 2000 BC or 250 BC. I spent time&#13;
there. I spent a good deal of time in Benares. I went down every month and cashed some money&#13;
and brought back medicine for my wife and other things and so on. Benares is a Hindu town,&#13;
and I got to know Benares India University and so on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         W. David Hopper&#13;
                               April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I met Mrs. [Indira] Gandhi, before she was president of the Congress Party, at Nehru's&#13;
suggestion, at her home in Allahabad. That was the family home, Nehru's home, her father's. I&#13;
then--periodically I'd go.&#13;
&#13;
Hill wrote me a letter to say that a man by the name of Art [Arthur T.] Mosher was coming,&#13;
former director at Allahabad, a [University of] Chicago graduate in agricultural economics but&#13;
before that an agriculturalist from University of Illinois. But he had been director of the&#13;
Allahabad Agricultural Institute for many years. So I biked down to Allahabad to see Mosher.&#13;
Mosher and I found that we were great, great--I mean, I'd been six months in the village and I&#13;
hadn't sorted anything out. It was just culture and so on. Mosher had also done a Ph.D. at&#13;
Chicago, focused on this issue of the villages in India and agriculture and so on, not from the&#13;
demographic point of view, which was my main concern, but as how do you feed the people.&#13;
&#13;
Mosher and I took a trip and sat in the back of a truck while they drove up to Lucknow, which is&#13;
the capital of Uttar Pradesh. And we sat back there and talked all the way up to Lucknow, which&#13;
is about a five-hour drive. They did what they had to do, and then we drove back--or were&#13;
driven back by the others from the Institute but sat in the back of the truck and talked for another&#13;
five hours. Mosher just really was the light in sorting out the difference between economics and&#13;
anthropology.&#13;
&#13;
Now, this comes back to the story, because when I gave my Ph.D. thesis, the anthropologists at&#13;
the table were concerned that I was talking about economic man too much in this.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: In the sense of Adam Smith's ...&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: In the sense of Adam Smith's and in the sense of [David] Ricardo and so on and so&#13;
forth and the others, that there is an economic response that's here. And the anthropologists&#13;
were concerned that there wasn't enough culture, that I really didn't spend the time on the&#13;
culture. I did. I did both in the thesis, but there was an economic trend running through it as&#13;
well as a cultural trend.&#13;
&#13;
Example: storage of grain. They had primitive storage. This was a mud village. It was&#13;
basically mud houses. There were a few--a couple, three, four, five, six brick houses, but this&#13;
was because they had income from outside. People wanted our glass bottles that we finished.&#13;
They would break them and they would put the glass into the mud that was around the grain&#13;
storages, so that if the rats came at it, they would get their paws to bleed and so on and they&#13;
would no longer try to--they would drill holes in this thing that held the grain. You had grain&#13;
storages. They were primitive, yes. Why did you have grain storage? I mean, why not sell it?&#13;
Well, number one, you had drought potential, so you had to carry it through. Number two, if you&#13;
had a marriage, you wanted to serve the baraal, the male, the groups that came along with the&#13;
groom to be married to the local woman--you wanted to feed them last year's grain because you&#13;
wanted to make it quite clear that you were sufficiently affluent to be able to provide your&#13;
daughter and receive him as a son-in-law by serving last year's grain because you had enough&#13;
grain to do this. So all of this was part of the cultural element of it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There was a guy digging a well. I wanted him to go down the--India was advertising. I had a&#13;
radio, all-India radio, a radio that was fixed-tuned to the local radio stations. I had a guy from&#13;
the local town come in and ask me if I could keep my canned goods for him because we did use&#13;
some cans, and he heard that we had, we used a toilet. Now, the toilet's another story, but the--it&#13;
was in this house, and I said yes. Well, he said, the toilet paper comes wrapped in a cardboard&#13;
roll. I said yes. He'd like me to save those for him because he was wrapping--he was in the&#13;
market town six miles away--he was wrapping these and creating what is known in the radio&#13;
trade as a tank circuit. Well, I knew immediately what it was. This is a variable condenser and a&#13;
coil, and you loop it through and you get different frequencies than you have, and this is how you&#13;
adjust the frequency on a radio. And what he wanted to do was to go around to the villages&#13;
where you had this all-India radio battery-driven machine, which got only one station, namely,&#13;
India station, but he wanted to convert it so that they could listen to a short-wave station that&#13;
came in from Ceylon, Radio Ceylon, which all India listened to because it's sort of movie music&#13;
and so on. But on the India radio station, what you got were deadly, deadly speeches and&#13;
discussions of ...&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: Government type.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: That's right, of how to do this and how to do that. But one of the things they wanted&#13;
to do was, when you dug a well, make sure that you put a cement wall around the well down&#13;
through the first aquifer that came in because everybody used the fields. I was unique in that the&#13;
villagers built a little septic tank and a toilet for me, and you flushed it with a bucket, because&#13;
they didn't want my wife exposed to--we were the pink race, and sitting out in the fields doing&#13;
your morning duties and so on was not what they felt that she ought to have. So we flushed it&#13;
with a bucket and out it went. But the upper aquifer had a lot of human waste on it, particularly&#13;
on the fields around the village, because that was a good manure and this is what you did.&#13;
&#13;
But I said to this guy that, you know, I was digging a well, and I said, "Let's put the wall around&#13;
it like the government radio was saying you ought to do, a cement wall so that you got it from&#13;
the second aquifer." In other words, the water had been filtered a little more and so on so some&#13;
of this stuff came into it.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the Indian at that time really didn't believe-I mean, diseases (malaria, et cetera) were&#13;
caused by bhoots. These were old crone women who paddled the fields at night. They walked in&#13;
translucent garments, and their feet were pointed backwards. And if you saw one on the path,&#13;
you better get off fast because she'd latch onto you and then you'd bring her home, latched onto&#13;
you. Then she'd sit at the head of the bed--not so that you could see her--but she just sat at the&#13;
head of the bed, and you had malaria. You got your illnesses. And so this was the belief.&#13;
&#13;
I said to him, "You've got to build your cement wall."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Why?"&#13;
&#13;
And I told him about the germs in the aquifers and so on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He looked at me, and he said finally, "Hopper, you believe in the germ theory of disease?" in&#13;
effect. I mean, it was in Bhojpuri, which is the local dialect.&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Yes, I do."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Have you ever seen a germ?"&#13;
&#13;
Now, there's no point in getting into microscopes and so on and so forth and wee beasties and&#13;
the rest of it. I said, "Well, no."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Aha!" He said, "I've seen a bhoot." But he did put in a cement wall. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
Another farmer, who in discussing this I was saying about using some fertilizer, and he said,&#13;
"Well, is it the right thing to do?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What do you mean by the right thing to do?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "You know, is this what God would have told"--not God but one of the incarnations of&#13;
God, Lord Krishna--"told to the charioteer," in a very, very long Hindu poem, several thousand&#13;
verses. And the charioteer--the Hindus at that time believed that you started battle at sunrise and&#13;
stopped at sunset. You cleared the battlefield and so on and so forth, and the next day it was the&#13;
other man's turn to be the attacker and you would be the defender, and the lord was out there&#13;
ready to move his troops, and he just didn't do it and he didn't do it, and the charioteer turned to&#13;
him and said, "Why are you not moving?" He said, "Well, because is this really worth it, all the&#13;
blood and the death and so on and so forth?" The charioteer more or less said--and the charioteer&#13;
was an impersonation of Lord Krishna--the charioteer said, "That's my problem. I'm God. You&#13;
just do it. And the right thing to do is to bring those troops together." And that's what was done.&#13;
&#13;
So the old farmer tells me, "Is using fertilizer the right thing to do?"&#13;
&#13;
1 discussed it with him and so on and so forth. 1 said I really didn't know in Lord Krishna's&#13;
terms whether it was the right thing to do.&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, I'd have to sort that out."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, you know, it will make a big difference in terms of your yield."&#13;
&#13;
We talked about that, and he finally looked at me and said, "You know, I'm an imperfect man.&#13;
I'm an imperfect man." He said, "I really want to do the right things, but then you come along&#13;
and tell me this might be a way to increase yield. 1 don't know whether that's the right thing to&#13;
do or not." He said, "It sounds like a good idea." [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
So it was this kind of balance between culture and economic man.&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAULT: Economic man is also, you know, feeding a few more people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          W. David Hopper&#13;
                               April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Feeding a few more people and so on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
This came up at my Ph.D. thesis. Mosher was on my committee now. He was on the faculty at&#13;
Cornell. And the anthropologists had some questions as to whether that I really hadn't done the&#13;
proper thing on the culture side. And the economists at my table--because it was agricultural&#13;
economics as my mother major and economics as my minor--the economists at the table were&#13;
saying, well, I found too much culture. [Laughter] And Mosher kind of got into it and said,&#13;
"Well, Dave, what you're really saying is that there's a balance between culture."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Yes."&#13;
&#13;
And the anthropologists said, "But that's not adequate. I mean, it's got to be culturally focused."&#13;
&#13;
Mosher took on my side with this balance. The economists kind of lined up because they were&#13;
unhappy with the culture components in it. Mosher kind of took them on, and it was an hour&#13;
debate, which I was out of. The decision was finally made, "Well, okay. All right, we'll give&#13;
him the degree. " [Laughter] So there you are.&#13;
&#13;
It's that balance that was there, and that balance I brought pretty much to what I do. I take a&#13;
look--you go down through the Bell Mission report, and you'll find I wrote several of the papers&#13;
in it. [Sir John] Crawford--I wrote with Crawford. Crawford did the main draft for the&#13;
agricultural section. It has been a balance that I've sought between the culture element, the way&#13;
this is evolving, and the economic element.&#13;
&#13;
You'll find that I had problems with the Swadeshi movement in India, which is "let's build&#13;
everything at home and not rely on the outside" and so on, and "if we didn't invent it ourselves&#13;
or patent it ourselves, then we don't want it," et cetera, that kind of dominates a good deal of&#13;
even Hinduism today, the VHP [Vishwa Hindu Parishad] and the shrine of Babri Masjid and BJP&#13;
[Bharatiya Janata Party] government in India. It's a very difficult thing that India had to struggle&#13;
with, and at the Bank and in Delhi when I was a vidyarti or a student in this thing, I was&#13;
struggling with just that, that set of issues. It was Mosher who kind of defended me, but it was&#13;
Mosher who clarified it.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Let me back up and ask you just some clarifying questions. Okay, so who at&#13;
Cornell was in the anthropology department at that time?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Ah. A man by the name of Morris Opler was the--Opler, O-P-L-E-R. He was the&#13;
anthropologist who was most deeply involved in India. Opler and I battled whenever he came&#13;
out to India because I was not doing what he wanted to do. I wasn't chasing the Brahmins&#13;
around trying to find out what they were doing and, well, renting and so on and so forth. I was&#13;
out in the field looking at soil types. I analyzed the whole ofthe soils in the village and got maps&#13;
made and so on and so forth of the village plots and what the [inaudible] were looking after. He&#13;
just was not--he didn't feel I was being an anthropologist.&#13;
&#13;
When I returned to Cornell after I left the village--I was in the village about two years. I got&#13;
there in September of 1953, and I left when it began to get hot in July of '55. I spent the better&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
part of a month over at the Maharaja of Benares, at his place doing some work that he wanted&#13;
done but really organizing my notes and getting ready to go home. It took about eleven trunks to&#13;
come back with the paper that I had because I did huge amounts of questionnaire work in the&#13;
village: economics, what were they doing, what were their labor relations, and so on. I wrote&#13;
several articles while I was there on this.&#13;
&#13;
The return back, and went back to Cornell, and Opler and I met, and he told me that he found my&#13;
work interesting but not--it wasn't anthropology.&#13;
&#13;
I went to the head of the anthropology department and said, "Look, I've put a fair amount of&#13;
money into this or a fair amount of work into this."&#13;
&#13;
He said he understood Opler's problems. He said, "We'll change you." So he changed me over&#13;
to a man who was working at that time in Peru and who had been an anthropologist in Brazil&#13;
when he was young, did his Ph.D. on a tribal group in Brazil that had never really been studied&#13;
and so on. He was quite an amazing guy. But they needed somebody who had expertise on&#13;
India, and Mosher was fortunately on the faculty then. So I got Art Mosher to come in on my&#13;
committee. And that was the mixture. Qpler opposed it all the way through.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: He remained on the committee then?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: No, no. He did not. He was dropped. But the other guy was very, very&#13;
understanding and so on. That was how the anthropologist played out.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Was he expecting you to do obviously some structuralist ...&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: No. What he was interested in was, quote, "the disappearing values in the society."&#13;
There was changes occurring. They had built a school back in 1865. After the mutiny, there'd&#13;
been a meeting ofthe--in 1857-there'd been a--British troops had come in and had disrupted a&#13;
wedding party that was out on the road four miles away from this village. The village is&#13;
Senapur, which means "the Place of the Army." And it was settled back in the 17th century, mid-&#13;
I i h century, by a family, a large family group, that came in, and that was their thing, because the&#13;
Dacoits or the tribals, et cetera, were all outsiders. This was where they did, and they built a&#13;
community that moved around and so on. But that's where the main group were. This village&#13;
was, had that main group in it, six Bhatis [phonetic] or six tribal families, if you want--related&#13;
but nevertheless independent. So the village was important.&#13;
&#13;
The British came back after this battle of the troops. These were sepoys, primarily, Indian troops&#13;
that were working for the East India Company before Britain came in as an official thing. They&#13;
came back into the village and they hung, or hanged, fourteen people in that village for what they&#13;
had done to the troops. And that garden where this hanging took place is still there. It's a very&#13;
important point in the village. But the village decided, the villagers decided, the landlords in this&#13;
village and the aristocracy group, the Kshatriyas or Rajput, decided that they would--their young&#13;
people had to get income, and the British are now going to tum against them, so we better get&#13;
them educated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 So they built a school in 1865. It was only Rajputs who went to that school. That's all, their&#13;
 sons, only Rajput males. They had a school. This is the young man that I met at Cornell who&#13;
 was also studying for a Ph.D. He was older than I was. He had finished up at [Balwant] Rajput&#13;
 College in India in Agra. They had a group that came from either that village or the surrounding&#13;
 villages. The head of the Indian civil service was one of these. The dean of the Lucknow law&#13;
 school was another one, et cetera. It was quite an educated group.&#13;
&#13;
 When I went to the villagers, the school was still there. It was still active. But this is part of&#13;
 where the change was, and it was moving. And Opler was unhappy that we weren't getting what&#13;
 was it. What was the culture? Yeah, now we're modernizing, but really what was this cultural&#13;
 base? And what I was interested in was the modernizations and how did I get them to, instead of&#13;
 producing, in the case of my best farmer, two tons per hectare of wheat and two and a half tons&#13;
 of rice per hectare, how did I get them producing four tons of wheat per hectare which, you&#13;
 know, nobody in India was producing, but that's a reasonable yield where I came from. So&#13;
 Opler and I just disagreed. I was looking to the future and he was looking to the past. And that's&#13;
 where it was.&#13;
&#13;
  One of the things I did when I got to the village, I met with the elders and said, "Okay, one of the&#13;
  things you're going to have to confront is the fact that I'm going to be here. I'm going to be here&#13;
. for a couple of years, and I'm going to be asking a lot of damn fool questions to people. These&#13;
  are going to be randomly selected households." It wasn't quite random because I had to put the&#13;
  important ones in but, basically, and randomly selected households. "I'm going to be quizzing&#13;
  them every month on what they ate and what they did and so on and so forth, and I'm going to be&#13;
  out every day quizzing people in the fields on what they're doing, where they're working, et&#13;
  cetera. And I'll be doing about fifteen people a day." I hired some young villagers, one guy&#13;
  from a market town who was an untouchable. I hired a local villager who was a Thakur, had&#13;
  been right up through college and spoke very good English. I hired another one who also spoke&#13;
  English but of the middle caste and so on. They did the work for me. They filled in the forms. I&#13;
  got forms; I printed them off in Benares and this sort of thing.&#13;
&#13;
 I went to the villagers and said, "Now what do I do? Do I provide money to the people? I mean,&#13;
 I have to do something. Do I give it to the village?" and so on. And they said they'd come back&#13;
 and talk to me. They called me up. They never came to the house. Occasionally they did, but in&#13;
 general I went up to them because I was no caste. I mean, there's high caste, there's medium&#13;
 caste, there's low caste, there's outcast, and there's no caste, and that's really down at the&#13;
 bottom. No caste is when you're not born in India. This is one of the problems right now with&#13;
 the Congress Party, because Sonia [Maino], who took over the Congress Party, married Rajiv&#13;
 Gandhi when he was a pilot in Italy--she's an Italian--she is continually criticized for being a&#13;
 foreigner, an outsider, even though she speaks Hindi and so on and so forth. But she's no caste&#13;
 because she hadn't been born in India. But they respected me because I was white-skinned and a&#13;
 vidyarthi, a student.                                .&#13;
&#13;
 But what did occur was that the villagers did call me in about three days' time and said, "What&#13;
 you will do is get books and copies" --this is the scribblers that you use in school-"and books"--&#13;
 because you had to buy those--"and give them to the low caste." This is the Chamars, the&#13;
 untouchables, in the village, which were the biggest chunk ofthe population but very few--they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          W. David Hopper&#13;
                               April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
only had small plots if they had them, but they were the purjans who worked for the landlords,&#13;
the jajmans. "We want those children to go to school."&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAULT: So the village decided.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: The village elders decided this, the village elder village group, the panchayat, if you&#13;
want, which means "five people," but it's a bigger group from each of the clans and so on and so&#13;
forth. And I said, okay, I'd do that. "But I know that there are two Chamars now working in&#13;
school, and they have to sit outside the classroom. They have to sit below the window outside.&#13;
They're not allowed into the classroom."&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAULT: Into the classroom.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: That's right. And this is it. They said, "That has changed. We have changed that.&#13;
They will be accepted at an equal basis, but they need books and copies they can't afford." So I .&#13;
went out to Bhargava Bhushan Press in Benares where I had gotten my cards made and so on,&#13;
questionnaires--I had punch cards, punches around the edges of them and I could sort them with&#13;
needles going through, sort out the cards and this sort of thing. I talked with Mr. Bhargava, and&#13;
he said he would give me a very cut rate on this, and he did. I brought the books and copies in&#13;
and passed them out, and the Chamar boys went to school. I got the Chamar leaders to meet, and&#13;
they sent virtually everyone of the Chamar boys to school.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Well, let me ask you this. I mean, it's often said that one ofIndia's obstacles to&#13;
modernization is the lack of equity among the castes.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Among the castes.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: So how do you explain the village deciding this, making this particular decision?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Why? Why? Why? Ask the question. Why? Before I got to that village, back in&#13;
the 1920s, there were 300--sorry--930,000 people in that village. When I got there in the 1950s,&#13;
there were 2,500 people in the village. The people were beginning to demand land--"Zamin,&#13;
zamin, zamin" --to use, the Chamars. They just kept pounding the land. "We need land. We&#13;
need land, because we don't have"--I mean, what did they do? They worked for their landlords.&#13;
The landlords were 25 percent of the village population, and there were some poor landlords&#13;
among them, but they got books and copies, too, by the way.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: "We have too many people. We cannot provide jobs for them. We cannot employ&#13;
them here. They've got to get educated. They've got to get out." That's the same argument that&#13;
you had against the British back in 1965, that we need to build a school to get our kids out, and&#13;
they wanted now to do this with the Chamars. And that was where it was. This is why. "We&#13;
have got to expand the school. We've got to change the whole position."&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: So they had no problem with the possibility oflosing their labor pool?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: None whatsoever.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: How were they going to replace it?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Well, because, you know, there were various ways of doing it. Besides, they knew&#13;
that there was a mechanized system that you can bring in. I mean, you know, they had seen&#13;
tractors. They saw me riding around in a motor bike. Cornell--because this was a, quote, "part&#13;
of their village structure," had ajeep out at the roadway that 1 could go to Allahabad in if!&#13;
needed to and so on, and I took villagers with me in that jeep to see the institute in Allahabad, to&#13;
visit other places and so on.&#13;
&#13;
And it was--one of the experiences that 1 had. The jeep broke down on a trip to Allahabad. We&#13;
climbed out of the jeep, and there it was. We walked over to the side. We left very early in the&#13;
morning. It was a hot, hot day. It was in May. It was about 120 degrees or so in the shade. No&#13;
it wasn't; it didn't get up to 120; about 115 or so. We walked over, and these guys, out from&#13;
underneath their dhotis came little Iotas and string. They went to the local well and sloshed the&#13;
mosquitoes offthe top of it and so on and so forth and pulled out water. It was brackish water.&#13;
Every time a bullock cart would go by this jeep (because we sent the driver on into town to get&#13;
some help), they'd nudge me and say, "[speaks phrase in Hindi]." "It's slow, but it goes."&#13;
[Laughter] "Very, very slow going, but it goes." 1 mean, this [inaudible] piece of Detroit iron&#13;
sitting out there on the road.&#13;
&#13;
At about--oh, 1 don't know; it was after twelve--one of the guys said to me (I only used boiled&#13;
water in the village, and they knew this) one of the guys said to me, "Hopper." This was an elder&#13;
who said to me, "You haven't had anything to drink since we left at six 0' clock in the morning."&#13;
He said, "1 know that this is not very good water, and 1 know that if you drink it you'll get sick.&#13;
But this is our country, and we know that if you don't drink it, you'll die." He handed me the&#13;
Iota.&#13;
&#13;
Now, you drank a Iota this way, through your hand and you suck it. You didn't put your lips to&#13;
the Iota. I drank it and it felt good. But in touching that Iota, it was contaminated. I knew that.&#13;
He would have to take it back and put it through a cleansing operation, which meant to put it in a&#13;
fire and put some Brahmin prayers to it and so on.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: And just for people listening, it would be contaminated because you were not a&#13;
Brahmin.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Because I was not a Kshatriya and so on. So I knew I was doing it, and it was being&#13;
contaminated, and 1 protested a bit. He said, "Drink, drink, drink," so 1 drank. He grabbed the&#13;
Iota. Now, he was the eldermost and considered to be the pukka leader, the top guy. He took&#13;
that Iota, put it up, and drank from it. And there was a total transformation among this group.&#13;
There were seven of us, eight of us. My Hindi approved. They relaxed because Ramdari&#13;
[phonetic] had drunk from the Iota, the contaminated Iota. 1 was now one of them. We walked&#13;
dO\\&gt;TI the road. "What the hell are we standing here for waiting for them to come and take us?"&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We walked down the road to a place and we went in. I drank water and ate food. We all ate&#13;
together and so on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
Well, that was in May of'54. When I left in July of'55, Ramdari [phonetic] and I were good&#13;
friends. I did what I normally have to do when you do this, and that is, I touched the feet of the&#13;
people. I bent to touch Ramdari's [phonetic] feet as a departure gesture, and he pulled me up and&#13;
said, "No, no, no, no." He said, "You taught me something. You remember the Iota on the trip&#13;
to Allahabad?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Yes."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "You know, Gandhi had always said that all humans are equal. Buddha said the same&#13;
thing." He said, "1 never believed it until you demonstrated it, what it meant, what it really was."&#13;
He said, "I need to touch your feet." [t was just one ofthese situations. But this is a cultural&#13;
kind of thing. It's not economic or economic man.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Right. Well, culture is always changing.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: It is. So th~s was part of it, and this was where things went. And the school was an&#13;
important component.&#13;
&#13;
When [Robert S.] McNamara came to the village--because 1 took him to the village in '81 before&#13;
he left the Bank--when he came to the village, the villagers built a road in. We didn't have a&#13;
road before then. The government built a road. It was known as the McNamara Road in that&#13;
village now. He opened up another chunk ofthe school.&#13;
&#13;
And in 19701 was in Canada at the IDRC [International Development Research Center], first&#13;
president ofthe IDRC. I got a little packet from India, which I opened up, and there was an&#13;
ivory stature of Saraswati, the goddess Saraswati, the goddess of learning and the arts and so on.&#13;
There are two goddesses, Saraswati and Lakshmi. No orthodox Hindu will ever have the both in&#13;
the same house. You're either learned and artistic and intelligent or you're with Lakshmi, and&#13;
she's the goddess of wealth. (You know, this is the Republican Party today in this country.)&#13;
[Laughter] I opened this thing up. Here is a little ivory statue of Saraswati. It was from the--a&#13;
note, a delightful note in English--from the first Chamar girl to have graduated from college.&#13;
And what she said is I gave the books and copies to her father, who went to grade six, became a&#13;
teacher at the primary school level, and insisted that she had to go to college. And she had just&#13;
graduated, and he insisted that she send me a token of this graduation, and this was the statue of&#13;
Saraswati.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: That's amazing.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: So today in Uttar Pradesh there are political parties, which are exceedingly&#13;
important, of the lower castes, the Chamars and so on. And these are the ones that I predicted in&#13;
the village when I was there, that this caste structure is going to collapse, and it is in the process&#13;
of collapsing. And you already have young people in India saying, "What the hell are we doing&#13;
with this caste business?" Now, you know, in the Christian tables--and I don't know whether&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                               April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
you're a Christian or not--but in the Christian tables, you come out with, you know, "we will--&#13;
the sins of the father shall be put to the children and even to the tenth generation" kind of thing.&#13;
Not in Hinduism. In Hinduism, you go up and down. There's a life and death--life, rebirth, life,&#13;
death, rebirth, life, death, rebirth cycle, depending upon your performance in your previous life.&#13;
And if you are a Chamar, an untouchable at the bottom, for--or a Shudra (there is the Sanskrit&#13;
term)--there are four castes in India. The Brahmins are at the top--teachers, intellectuals, and so&#13;
on. There is the Kshatriyas in the middle, the second one, which are the warriors, the political&#13;
sources, and that sort of thing. There are the Vaishyas, the next one, which are the artisans and&#13;
the laborers, the workers, the artists, and the rest of it. Then there are the Shudra at the bottom.&#13;
Those are the untouchables. And the Chamars are part of the Shudra. They deal with dead&#13;
animals. They strip the hides off them. They deal with dead materials and so on. And below&#13;
them are the Doms. Those are the ones who look after the burning ghats and bum the corpses of&#13;
people and this kind of thing. And there's a whole array ofthese untouchable castes. In some&#13;
parts of India there are unseeables, and there's others where their shadow on you will be&#13;
contaminating and this kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
All right. Those are now in the process of alteration and change. And what's emerging is a very,&#13;
very different kind of Hinduism. And there's a battle now in the Indian election between the BJP&#13;
(the Hindu fascist party, basically) and fifty different political groups that have now clustered in&#13;
India, some of whom are Muslim, some of whom are high Hindus, some--and many, many of&#13;
them are the low castes. And when I lived in the village, it was just a matter of time; the low&#13;
castes were, you know, a group that knew they were downtrodden. They had the leadership that&#13;
was--every time you talk with them, "Zamin, zamin. What we need is land, land."&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Now, how much did you think--I know that in 1969 Indira Gandhi split the&#13;
Congress [Party], right, and created a new electorate. How much did that kind of play into this?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: No, it didn't play into this. Well, we can get to that later because it's a long story.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: It's a long story. Okay. All right. So it's 1955.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: I left in 1955, and I came back to finish up my Ph.D., got it in '57, was secretary to a&#13;
development group at Cornell and so on, bringing together economists and anthropologists and&#13;
agriculturalists and the rest of it as to what we could do. And it was financed from various&#13;
sources, including what is now U.S. AID [Agency for International Development]--at that time it&#13;
was the Technical Cooperation Administration and so on. I didn't know what I was going to do.&#13;
What do you do? I went to Guelph University in Canada or the Ontario Agricultural College, to&#13;
be exact, in '57 and was there in '59. I was not very happy. I was a land economist because&#13;
that's what I did my agricultural economics in. I was basically a land economist and didn't do&#13;
much on India.&#13;
&#13;
And then I got a telephone call from--I was just about ready to move into the radio business&#13;
because I had worked very extensively among farmers at Guelph at the Ontario Agricultural&#13;
College. And my father had been offered the presidency of Guelph back in 1949 and turned it&#13;
down, and that was all right. It wasn't an exciting place to be, but the students liked me and had&#13;
lots of fun. My wife had been with me in India, and we had a daughter. I got a call from Mosher&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
first and then from Hill to say that Hill was now with the Ford Foundation. He was Vice&#13;
President for International Activities at Ford. And Mosher had left and formed a corporation&#13;
supported by the Rockefeller Foundation on agricultural development. Ford and Rockefeller did&#13;
this.&#13;
&#13;
In '58 I had gone down, at Hill's request, to New York to listen to him and George Harrar, who&#13;
was then the head of agriculture at the Rockefeller Foundation. They discussed back in 1943--&#13;
I'm taking you way back on this--back in 1943 or 1941, when [Franklin D.] Roosevelt won his&#13;
term in the 1940 election, a third term--nobody had ever heard ofthis, a president with a third&#13;
term. He won in '32 and he won in '36 and he won in '40. He appointed Henry Wallace as his&#13;
vice president. Henry Wallace was famous for having produced hybrid com and hybrid&#13;
chickens. But Roosevelt confronted the fact that the Germans in '39 were opening up very, very&#13;
strong ties with Mexico, so he sent Wallace down to Mexico-I mean, he couldn't go--he sent&#13;
Wallace down to Mexico in early '41 to discuss aUofthese German ties with the Mexican&#13;
government. And Wallace went down. Before he went down, he was approached by then head&#13;
ofthe Rockefeller Foundation, president--I'll think of his name in a moment; I've got senior&#13;
moments that afflict me--at a meeting ofthe Council on Foreign Affairs [Relations]. 'Henry was&#13;
discussing that he was going with the Council members, and he was approached by Raymond&#13;
Fosdick and the Rockefeller head. He was approached by Fosdick, who was told, "Henry, while&#13;
you're down there, why don't you take a look at the rural health clinics that we've put up,"&#13;
because the Rockefeller Foundation began as a health group, and it was always very strongly&#13;
focused on health.&#13;
&#13;
So Raymond went down--or Wallace went down and came back. He didn't talk with Henry.&#13;
But in 1943, they met again at another meeting ofthe--now with the U.S. at war. They met again&#13;
at another meeting of the Council on Foreign Relations. Wallace said to Fosdick, "You know,&#13;
Henry, what I saw--I looked at your health clinics, but let me tell you something. You'd do more&#13;
for the health of the people of Mexico if you could raise com yields one bushel per acre and&#13;
wheat yields one bushel per acre than you will with all your dam health clinics."&#13;
&#13;
And Fosdick, never one to pass up a bad idea, proceeded to build, starting in 1943, a--he got&#13;
Miles Brady from--I'm sorry, Dick [Richard] Bradfield from Cornell, and he got geneticists from&#13;
Harvard, and he got pathologists, plant pathologists, from Minnesota to kind of consult with him.&#13;
And they formed what is known as the Office of Special Studies, the OSS. And they moved&#13;
down Norm Borlaug and a series of others into this thing to look at com, wheat, beans, and&#13;
potatoes. And Borlaug went up to Sonora and began working on wheats and the rest of it and&#13;
didn't do very well. Neither did any of the rest of them, but they got some hybrid maize in, but&#13;
hybrid maize, there's no way that the peasants could afford to buy the new seed every year,&#13;
which you need to do with hybrid maize, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And it didn't go very far.&#13;
&#13;
It did after' 46, and particularly the work of a man by the name of Skelton [So Cecil Salmon],&#13;
who went to Japan and came back with the USDA and brought with him various grains that the&#13;
Japanese had had, including among them a dwarf wheat, which Borlaug was looking for up in&#13;
Sonora to do it, because the whole focus of the--the other thing was how do we get rid of the&#13;
pests and the diseases and so on, and Borlaug decided the hell with the diseases. Wheat rust is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
going to be there. It comes down from the US and there's nothing we can do about it, but let's&#13;
get wheat that'll grow.&#13;
&#13;
He and a guy by the name of [Orville] Vogel up in the Palouse area of Washington State took a&#13;
look at this stuff that came back into USDA out at Beltsville. And here was this funny little&#13;
wheat that the Japanese had found, and they were really after in the searches of the 1930s. You&#13;
know, they're little dwarf wheats and they're like little Japanese, little dwarf Japanese, and they&#13;
like these wheats, and this is it. So Borlaug picked those up in the Palouse area, and they found&#13;
they produced a very, very rigid straw but low, and they withstood the winds blowing in the&#13;
Palouse area down here. And Borlaug really transformed--by 1955, Mexico was totally self-&#13;
sufficient in wheat, not buying from the U.S. And the same thing in the U.S. with these dwarf&#13;
wheats.&#13;
&#13;
The dwarf wheats came to India in 1962 when I was working with the Ford Foundation, and&#13;
that's a totally different story. But I was following--I had decided and Hill had decided that we&#13;
needed research from my previous work in the village. And in '59 Hill gave me a call.&#13;
&#13;
In '58 1 went down, and Hill had a lunch at the University Club with Harrar, who was down on&#13;
this Mexican thing, and said, "George, you know, you guys are working in Mexico on beans and&#13;
potatoes and com and wheat. What are you doing about rice? Half the world eats rice."&#13;
&#13;
And Harrar said--and I was at the table--Harrar said, "Well, we're not doing anything."&#13;
&#13;
Frosty said, "Why not? Halfthe world eats rice."&#13;
&#13;
And Harrar said, "I haven't got the money."&#13;
&#13;
And Hill said something that the Rockefeller Foundation has never lived down and neither has&#13;
Ford, and that is, "Look, I got the money, you got the brains, why don't we meet?" [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: The start of all great relationships.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: So they proceeded to do--they went to produce rice, and the International Rice&#13;
Research Institute in the Philippines was the outcome of this.&#13;
&#13;
And in '59 I was all set to leave Guelph and go work for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#13;
on agriculture. I got a call. I called in my secretary to dictate my resignation from Guelph, and I&#13;
got a call on the telephone while I was in the middle of this from Moser saying, "Hill's going to&#13;
give you a call. He wants you to go to Chicago."&#13;
&#13;
So I said, "Okay."&#13;
&#13;
I told the secretary to go away, and the call came through. It was Frosty Hill. He offered me--&#13;
I'm sorry, it was Ted [Theodore W.] Schultz from Chicago to say that Hill had spoken to him&#13;
about me and they would like me to come to Chicago to join the faculty in economics. He was&#13;
an agricultural economist and very famous, won a Nobel Prize in economics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Didn't he write Transforming Traditional Agriculture?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: That's right, yeah. He wanted me to come to Chicago and be there to take a look at&#13;
some of these issues that I had been raising in India. Ford Foundation paid for it. I went, gave a&#13;
seminar, had a hell of a time in the seminar because I came from a land grant college where&#13;
everything is very, you know, "I am very interested in this, but are you not going a little too far&#13;
on that and the rest of it?" I go to Cornell [Chicago], and, my God, they sliced me up and spread&#13;
me around the room. It was nothing, nothing kind about it.&#13;
&#13;
And I went down and saw the dean afterwards, Gale Johnson. And he said, "We want to offer&#13;
you ajob."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "After that performance?" I said, "Look, I suggest that you get in touch with one man&#13;
named Morris Opler, who used to be at Cornell and whom I had had big differences with,&#13;
because I'm not sure that I'm the guy you want," because it was a joint appointment. Economics&#13;
would pay for it, but I'd have an operation over in anthropology as well.&#13;
&#13;
And there was a long pause, and suddenly Johnson opens the drawer and says, "Look, we don't&#13;
usually show the private communications we have with somebody, but I think you might be&#13;
interested in reading this," and he handed me a letter. And it was four pages ofthe damnedest&#13;
diatribe against me you ever saw, signed by Morris Opler.&#13;
&#13;
I said--I handed it back to him. I said, "Well, he's right on every point."&#13;
&#13;
And Johnson looked at me and said, "Yes, and we decided that a man of his eminence, if he&#13;
really says these things about you, that's the kind of man we want on our faculty." So I joined&#13;
Chicago.&#13;
&#13;
And in late '61, I got another call from Hill to say that the Ford Foundation had a big operation&#13;
in India; he wanted me to go out and really analyze it. That meant I had to join it--I became the&#13;
historian for what was known in the Ford Foundation as a book that they wrote, material that&#13;
they had presented, called India's Food Crisis and Steps to ideet It. Now, that crisis started in&#13;
1957. After the British left, between '48 or '47--they officially left '48 when it became a&#13;
republic--and '57, agriculture had been sufficient. Then they had a very, very bad drought year&#13;
in '56, '57, and they had to import.&#13;
&#13;
Now, that particular year was very important from several perspectives. First of all, [Eugene R]&#13;
Black at the World Bank--India had been borrowing money, because they were at the Bretton&#13;
Woods conference. They were part of this Bank structure, even though they were a British&#13;
colony, and when they left, the British left, India signed on as a country. They had been&#13;
borrowing from the Bank but at the same rates that everybody else borrowed at the Bank, and&#13;
India no longer could pay their debt. So Black decided that there would have to be something&#13;
else, and IDA, the International Development Association, is what was created for poor&#13;
countries. And India's debt was eased and excused and transferred, basically, to IDA. And the&#13;
first Indian consortium was held in 1958, and Black chaired it. Twenty-five years later, I held&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 the next Indian consortium. I chaired all of them when I went to the Bank after '78. Black&#13;
 chaired the first few Indian consortiums.&#13;
&#13;
 The Pakistanis complained, and there was a Pakistan consortium then created in ' 62.&#13;
&#13;
  But the first one was the Indian consortium. And he brought the donors to the table, and he&#13;
. demanded that they say what they are going to give to India and deliver. There was no welshing&#13;
  or anything else. That was what you had to put in.&#13;
&#13;
 The second thing they did was resurrect PL-480. It was sitting in the U.S. books for a long&#13;
 period of time. That's Public Law 480, which allowed the U.S. to provide food for, really, just&#13;
 writing IOUs, transferring food to India. And the PL-480 came into India, wheat and so on.&#13;
&#13;
 The third thing that the World Bank did in this particular venture: they had extended this to&#13;
 India, so they had to extend it to Pakistan. They had to extend to it a series of other countries,&#13;
 and that was the IDA arrangement, that they got out of the heavy debt relationships.&#13;
&#13;
 But the other thing the World Bank did, they opened up an office in India, not as powerful as&#13;
 they are today, but they were there. And visits were made and so on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
 FEL TAULT: Now, this was about when?&#13;
&#13;
 HOPPER: This was '58, following the--'58, '59.&#13;
&#13;
 FELTAULT: There's no record of that in any of the files.&#13;
&#13;
 HOPPER: No, there isn't. There isn't. But this is what Black did, and they were critical. This&#13;
 is the creation oflDA. That's the file you would have to ask for, what the hang happened and so&#13;
 on and what happened to the Indian debt, because India suddenly was now there and the Bank&#13;
 was involved. And it--it was critical on this thing.&#13;
&#13;
 So the consortium, the meetings, the development of this was kind of Black's idea. It wasn't just&#13;
 kind of, you know, World Bank people going and seeing what we could pledge you for and this&#13;
 sort of business.&#13;
&#13;
 All right. The Ford Foundation sent somebody in to look at the food problem, and they created a&#13;
 report called India's Food Crisis and Steps to Meet It. The head ofthe Ford Foundation there at&#13;
 the time was a man by the name of Doug [Douglas] Ensminger. And I met Doug when I was a&#13;
 student or a vidyarti in the area. I was not highly impressed with Doug, but he was a very nice&#13;
 guy. Doug was head of the USDA, the United States Department of Agriculture'S really&#13;
 community programs, and he was a rural sociologist. He tried to do the same thing in India. He&#13;
 was very active in community development in India. And it was community development not&#13;
 focused on economics of the community but how do we get the community to unite and be part&#13;
 of it and so on. And I used to tease him and say, "Well, Doug, you know, your problem with&#13;
 communities is that you were doing this back in the 1930s when it was important that you got the&#13;
 farmers to continue to vote with ballots not with bullets," because we had a desperate problem,&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and people moving out of Oklahoma to California and so on and so forth. It was huge poverty.&#13;
And there wasn't much we could do about it. There wasn't all that much money, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
So Doug and community development were very important. And the issue was: how do you get&#13;
them to meet? How do you get them to bring them together? He helped the community&#13;
development movement that developed in India, and he got the panjayats going and so on and so&#13;
forth, and all of this was part of this structure.&#13;
&#13;
And this was what the Ford program was about, and the Ford program agreed to take on seven&#13;
districts in India. Ford would put up several million dollars, and the government oflndia would&#13;
put up some money, and they would have Ford people go in and they would really try to get the&#13;
communities to activate and begin to plant properly and that sort of thing.&#13;
&#13;
I was skeptical and so was Hill. Now, Hill in '58 was talking about rice research because I had&#13;
kept hammering at the fact that there wasn't any damn research. We didn't know what to do.&#13;
But Ensminger's whole approach was get the farmers to unite, and the big farmers will tell the&#13;
little farmers what to do and so on and so forth. I didn't--Christ, the grain wasn't there. The&#13;
soils weren't there. The soils were heavily depleted. The fertilizer wasn't available.&#13;
&#13;
I went and talked with the head ofthe--at one point, a little later when I was there--the secretary&#13;
of finance or the deputy minister of finance, why didn't he bring in fertilizer.&#13;
&#13;
His comment was, "Hopper, why should I bring in fertilizer? We have the fields, the farms of&#13;
Kansas and Saskatchewan, count on the Canadian aid, food aid, PL-480, et cetera. And we can't&#13;
afford to bring in fertilizer. Forget it." This was the attitude in government.&#13;
&#13;
Okay, I come in. The first speech I gave when I got there in January 1960--or February '62--to&#13;
the Ford group--I'd said, yes, I'd leave Chicago. Schultz was disappointed. I was offered&#13;
tenure. I went off to India. My wife joined me; my first wife joined me. She spoke Hindi very&#13;
well and so on, and we had servants. We had a couple of children. They were kids. And it was&#13;
a very good thing.&#13;
&#13;
But in my first speech to the Ford group was, "You're short of research. I mean, you're going&#13;
into the communities; you don't know what to do. You tell them to line up the thing so that the&#13;
crop lines are north and south so they get the sun in both the east and west sides. They haven't&#13;
got the grain. Their wheat is Punjab 591. There's no fertilizer for it. It grows up, wind blows in,&#13;
it lodges"--that is, it falls over-"the straws break, and that's it." Now, '62 was there, and '62,&#13;
the autumn of '62--you plant wheat in India in the fall when the ground cools down enough--and&#13;
, 62 Borlaug brought in his wheats from Mexico, and we had the first time.&#13;
&#13;
But that was with the Rockefeller Foundation not the Ford Foundation, and Ford would not listen&#13;
to this. Ensminger was absolutely thunderstruck with me, wanted to--they told Hill to take me&#13;
back.&#13;
&#13;
Hill said, "No, no. Leave him there." I was known as the historian of the project, and I was&#13;
known as the guy, the odd guy out. But it's surprising because he had a staff of thirteen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Americans who were there, and half of them were kind of on my side: "We don't have the&#13;
research. We don't have the varieties. We don't have this."&#13;
&#13;
I worked as much with Rockefeller as 1 did with Ford in doing this. Borlaug came in '63, and he&#13;
and 1--1 had seen his wheats. They hadn't done very well on this agricultural--at the Indian&#13;
Agricultural Research Institute or up at Ludhiana, the Punjab University. Both of--the&#13;
Agricultural Research Institute had been developed by the British outside--that was first of all&#13;
down at Bihar and then moved up to Delhi. I went to that place several times and had a lot to do&#13;
with them, eventually became a visiting professor. The Punjab up at Ludhiana was controlled by&#13;
Michigan State. I had been a--not Michigan State, sorry. Ohio State. And I had been at Ohio&#13;
State as a visiting professor before when I was at Guelph, talking about agriculture in India and&#13;
so on. They had people there that I had met in Columbus who were up at Punjab.&#13;
&#13;
And they tested out the wheats. They didn't look very good. They didn't work very well.&#13;
&#13;
I went out to visit some farmers, and the first thing I got from the farmers is, "Sahib, get us some&#13;
of those new wheats, those short ones."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, they didn't do very well."&#13;
&#13;
"Oh, Sahib, they don't know how to plant and irrigate over there at the university. You get us&#13;
some of those wheats, we'll see what you can do."&#13;
&#13;
Well, we did. We brought in a few more. The next year we got some more, and we did this sort&#13;
of thing. They were red wheats, and Indians like white wheat and so on. And eventually they&#13;
got a radiation chamber, some uranium, to radiate red wheats, and we got white wheats out of&#13;
them and that kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
By 1964 India was producing more wheat and doing better, and these new varieties were&#13;
beginning to move out, but not in large numbers. '64-'65--well, '63, no, '64-'65 India got one of&#13;
the best wheat crops they'd ever had. And in part this was because of an extension of these new&#13;
wheats, but in part it was a good year, and in part we got some fertilizer in. Now, this was when&#13;
the Bell Mission got going in '65, and I went out. Sir John Crawford came in, and I had known--&#13;
my father had known Crawford. I hadn't met him. I went out to the airport to meet him.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
Sir John came in, and I went out to the airport to meet him. I didn't know who the hell he was.&#13;
mean, I knew who he was, but I hadn't met him. A little short guy. He came in. I had&#13;
hammered at research. Hill believed it. Rockefeller believed it. Ford didn't believe it. The&#13;
World Bank didn't believe it. And Crawford's first question to me: "What kind of research have&#13;
they got?" [Laughter] You know.&#13;
&#13;
"Lousy."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                         W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May J 2, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    22&#13;
&#13;
It turns out that he just--we became awfully close friends. He had been here--during the Second&#13;
World War, Crawford had been the Deputy Minister for the Secretary for Agriculture, the&#13;
Deputy Minister for Agriculture in Australia. And the Second World War came; he had been&#13;
totally unable in Australia, with all the efforts, to increase food production. The U.S. here had&#13;
started back--the first use of fertilizer was the Germans in the First World War when they put&#13;
ammonium nitrate from the munitions operations--later to blow up, the Oklahoma bombers and&#13;
so on--but they put ammonium nitrate to grow turnips and potatoes because they had--the Allies&#13;
had cut off a good deal of their food supplies and so on. And they blew the lid off these crops by&#13;
putting them out.&#13;
&#13;
We sent virtually all our Ph.D.s in agriculture and agricultural economics to Germany for their&#13;
Ph.D.s, and our Ph.D. program is not a D.Phil. program, i.e., the British--or e.g., the British. The&#13;
Ph.D. programs that we have now are German Ph.D. This is what you did in Germany. You&#13;
wrote yourself a dissertation. You appeared before the committee and so on and so forth. And&#13;
what we did was to go to Germany to take a look at what they were doing on science, and we&#13;
found an agricultural group who were really advancing science. They came back, filled our&#13;
universities in the '20s and so on. We did a hell ofa lot of research. The '30s came; there was&#13;
just--there was no market for it, so it sat on the shelves.&#13;
&#13;
The Second World War breaks out; we increase food production by forty percent within a few&#13;
years. We doubled it virtually before the end of the war. We diverted munitions; we diverted&#13;
other stuff to fertilizer. We built the Tennessee Valley Authority and the fertilizer unit down at&#13;
Mussel Shoals, Alabama, so they were close to power and the rest of it, which now the&#13;
International Fertilizer Development Center is down there.&#13;
&#13;
We did a whole series of things to get fertilizer out. We diverted from building Ford cars and so&#13;
on and so forth, Model Ts and the rest of it, to work on tractors. We designed combines. That&#13;
had been developed back in the--or the grain harvester had been developed back in the 19th&#13;
century, but we now could add a gasoline engine to it and do a series of other things. We had a&#13;
whole lot of stuff on the shelf which we were able to dump into it.&#13;
&#13;
Crawford found they didn't have it in Australia. So he came back to Australia. He came over&#13;
here. He did a Ph.D. over here. He spent time looking at all of this. He returned to Australia in&#13;
the early '50s, late '40s and recast the whole of the Australian scientific council to move them&#13;
into agriculture. They did soils analysis. They found that Australia was desperately short of&#13;
some trace minerals. They doubled their--they began dumping the trace minerals from aircraft&#13;
and so on and so forth. In the process, they doubled yields. They began developing--instead of&#13;
the rabbits taking everything--the rabbits, yeah, were out there and all the rest of it--but they just&#13;
expanded agriculture immensely. And by the mid-'50s, they had increased their agricultural&#13;
output globally by 53,56, up to 80 percent of this thing.&#13;
&#13;
And Crawford was now brought in to India in '64, and the first question he had is what did they&#13;
do on research. Nothing. So he and I became kind of a bastion for research.&#13;
&#13;
Now, Ford also brought in Wolf Ladejinsky, who is another old friend, and Wolfwas very, very&#13;
dedicated to the Russian proposal. He was a Russian Jew, left Russia at the time of Lenin or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         W. David Hopper&#13;
                               April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
after Lenin. And as he pointed out, Lenin--the Russians succeeded by Lenin looking at the serfs&#13;
at the time of the naval uprising in St. Petersburg and announced, you know, "Go horne. Claim&#13;
yourself a piece. Take your guns. Claim yourself a piece of land, and we'll protect you." And&#13;
this is what broke the whole of the feudal system in Russia. There was a battle, yes, between the&#13;
Reds and the traditional ones. The tsar was killed and so on and so forth, and the Lenin bunch&#13;
took over.&#13;
&#13;
Ladejinsky was firmly convinced that the issue in India was you had too many talkers out here,&#13;
too many high caste, owning the land, and we need to break it up. Now, India did break up some&#13;
ofthat land after the British had left. They didn't break it up in Bihar, and it's still a major&#13;
problem in Bihar. They did in eastern Uttar Pradesh, but they still had the Charnars, and they're&#13;
not going to break it down into the small plots. But that was his solution.&#13;
&#13;
The Bell Mission wanted to look at agriculture. Crawford kind of went away from what Bernie&#13;
Bell was doing, which was basically macroeconomics. We all got involved. I worked for him.&#13;
Ford has assigned me to him, Ensminger's objections notwithstanding. Hill absolutely&#13;
demanded I had to go. I made a speech in Mexico to a group ofthe Ford resident&#13;
representatives, of which Ensminger was one, which I said, you know, it had to be research.&#13;
This was before we got involved with the Bell Mission. Except for the fact that Hill and the then&#13;
head of the Rockefeller Foundation, then president, were very impressed with me, nobody else&#13;
was.&#13;
&#13;
Carne my, the end of my Ford contract, which was 1965 December, Ensminger called me in in&#13;
September '65 and said, "Well, you know, Hill is 65 as of December." And he was; he was born&#13;
in late December 1900. "The president ofthe Rockefeller Foundation is leaving. There are a lot&#13;
oflame ducks in the Rockefeller Foundation. Dave, you're one of them." [Laughter] So in&#13;
other words, he's not going to renew. Ford paid me quite well.&#13;
&#13;
George Harrar carne into town. The head of the Rockefeller office kind of waylaid him. And he&#13;
was looking for an economist. He needed to get an economist, and Harrar hated economists.&#13;
Harrar had been head of this Mexican thing. He couldn't stand economists. They carne in and&#13;
were always kind of bitching about this and that and the other thing. So he agreed with Ralph&#13;
Cummings, who was the head of the Rockefeller Foundation there, the late Ralph Cummings&#13;
now. His son just retired from U.S. AID.&#13;
&#13;
Ralph got me to go see George. George said, "How much are they paying you?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "I'm getting 16,000 a year from Ford."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "I can only pay you twelve."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "George, I'll do a deal with you. I'll take the twelve, and I'll quit in two years if you're&#13;
not satisfied. But if you are satisfied, I'm going to ask then for 24,000." I said, "I'll expect it to&#13;
start as of now. So let's take a look. You pay twelve. At the end of two years, if you're not&#13;
satisfied, 1 step out. At the end of--ifyou're satisfied, fine. Then we move to 24."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                               April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He thought a moment and said, "It's a deal. That's a deal."&#13;
&#13;
So I moved to Rockefeller and paid out [inaudible] I had--and so on and so forth--and moved to a&#13;
different place. I had a lovely house with Ford. I had to get an apartment with Rockefeller and&#13;
so on. But I proceeded to teach.&#13;
&#13;
But Frosty and I--Sir John and I and the Bell Mission were there. I came back to here in '64 and&#13;
wrote a fair amount of the Bell Mission reports on agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: The Bell Mission worked satisfactorily, and I think we gave a reasonable report.&#13;
This was it.&#13;
&#13;
In early 1967--I'm sorry--March 1966, India had two periods of drought. The crops were way&#13;
down. Nehru died in '64. In '65, fall of '65, there was a bad year. '64-'65 was a very bad year,&#13;
and India had to import about ten percent of its food grain requirements. Lal Bahadur Shastri&#13;
had taken over as the prime minister. Lal Bahadur is an interesting guy. I had met him down at&#13;
Allahabad back when I was a vidyarti. He came from near there. He was really a scholar and&#13;
Buddhist and kind of Hindu tradition of intellectuals, very, very spare and so on. I have a picture&#13;
of him walking down the street, Metcalf Street, actually, in Canada with the parliament buildings&#13;
is behind him in January with snow everywhere, walking out in sandals and a dhoti. [Laughter]&#13;
I mean, this was Lal Bahadur.&#13;
&#13;
I had written an article for an Indian paper on "Not "After Nehru, Who?" It's' After Nehru,&#13;
What?'" I predicted that Lal Bahadur would be Nehru's successor, and he was when Nehru died&#13;
in May '64. I saw Nehru just two weeks before he died or, no, about a month before he died. I&#13;
had just come back from Rajasthan. He had heard I had been there. He invited me over. His&#13;
aide-de-camp called me and said could I come over. I said yes. He said, "Can you come over&#13;
fairly early in the morning because he's not quite himself after eleven?" I did.&#13;
&#13;
We had some breakfast and tea out on the porch at seven 0' clock. He wanted to know about&#13;
Rajasthan. I said, "I was over there. I was in Gandhinagar." I said, "The farmers were&#13;
complaining bitterly because they were being asked to produce pigs and some other grains that&#13;
they didn't like and didn't know by the government of Rajasthan." I said, "You know, I don't&#13;
understand it, Pandit-ji. It just doesn't seem to make any difference that they're there." By the&#13;
way, "ji" at the end of a name is an honorific in India.&#13;
&#13;
His statement was, "You know, our problem is we have to get people to want to plan."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "What do you mean, Pandit-ji?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, we've got to get people to want to plan."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Pandit-ji, you wrote the book The Discovery of India. And the marvelous thing about the&#13;
book there is the eclecticism of India, all the beliefs that were here, the great montage of beliefs&#13;
and statements and so on and so forth. How are you going to get them to want to plan?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Look, Pitamber knows exactly"--Pitamber Pant at the Planning Commission, physicist;&#13;
I liked Pitamber but--"Pitamber knows exactly what we require." He said, "We have to get&#13;
people to want that."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Pandit-ji, they're never going to want it. This is still the eclectic thing that you wrote&#13;
about in The Discovery of India." And we talked about it, and it didn't go anywhere. And he&#13;
died a month later.&#13;
&#13;
Lal Bahadur came in. He fought the war in '65, and he died up in Tashkent in early '66. And I&#13;
wept because he wasjust--he was one of my heroes. He died in January '66.&#13;
&#13;
In ' 65 we had this very low thing. We needed to bring in more food and so on. And there was a&#13;
dispute going on between me, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the chief statistician,&#13;
USDA. Our estimates were that they got about 76 million tons of food in '65, which wasn't&#13;
good, wasn't bad. The previous year, the best year, had been 81 million tons, the previous year.&#13;
It dropped to 76. The states reported in the amount of food they had in each of the states, and&#13;
they did this by crop cuts and so on and so forth. They reported in they got 68 million tons. I&#13;
took a look at the reports, and it was quite clear that the food surplus states were underestimating&#13;
because they didn't want to be held responsible for all of that food that had to go elsewhere, and&#13;
the food deficit states were underestimating because that put them in line to receive more food&#13;
from the central sources and the PL-480, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
So we went--I went, sat at the back. [J. S.] Sarma went up to the table as the, in the Ministry of&#13;
Food and Agriculture statisticians, and we got the minister of agriculture to agree--this was&#13;
Subramaniam, K. [Chidambaram] Subramaniam. Subramaniam agreed. We made these&#13;
presentations. But each of the states was around the table, and each state said that this is the data&#13;
they had and so on and so forth. And we couldn't move them. I mean, we couldn't move them.&#13;
&#13;
"68."&#13;
&#13;
"76."&#13;
&#13;
And finally Lal Bahadur banged down the gavel, and I learned the difference between statistical&#13;
truth and political truths. And he said, "All right, I'll call a meeting ofthe chief ministers of&#13;
India, and we will decide what we produced." And he did, and in the official record today it's 72&#13;
million tons. [Laughter] It's political truth. You see it going on now over the issue of [Richard&#13;
A.] Clarke and Condi [Condoleezza] Rice and so on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
So Subramaniam decided that he had to do something, and I had a brief conversation with him.&#13;
He visited several of our wheat demonstration plots that we had scattered around now and&#13;
brought in more wheats and saved some of the other stuff and so on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                         W. David Hopper&#13;
                               April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;/&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And 1 got a call in May of '64-well, it was March '64 or '66--from Ralph Cummings (I was&#13;
now with Rockefeller with Ralph Cummings) to say that he had just got a call from&#13;
Subramaniam, and he's sending a mission off to Mexico to buy 25,000 tons of Mexican wheat. I&#13;
said, "Ralph, not a hope. There's no way he can get 25,000. No way he can get the money for&#13;
that. It'll be five or six million dollars that they're going to need. Forget it."&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: This was that special wheat that had been created there in Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: That's right, which we were short of. That was a Sunday--no, Saturday, Saturday. I&#13;
got a call Sunday afternoon to say that--no, I got a call Monday morning from Ralph Cummings&#13;
to say that five Indians had just left on Air India for New York with five million dollars to buy&#13;
wheat from Mexico. And Subramaniam had convinced Mrs. Gandhi that this is what they ought&#13;
to do. They bought-he'd phoned, Ralph had phoned Borlaug in Mexico, and Borlaug said,&#13;
"Get them in here fast, because we're harvesting and we need to harvest the best, ifthat's what&#13;
they want."&#13;
&#13;
They brought in 16,000 metric tons of wheat to India. They couldn't get 25. They brought it in.&#13;
It came in by ship. There was--Subramaniam held a meeting of the Tonnage Club. This is a&#13;
group of farmers, wealthy farmers, big farmers, who had formed a club to kind of increase&#13;
yields, and they had bought fertilizer and so on. And the Tonnage Club met. I went down to sit&#13;
and listen. And there was a discussion about what should they charge for this. And it was&#13;
decided by the government that they would charge what it cost, what we had to pay in Mexico,&#13;
the shipping charges, and so on and so forth. And they came up with--there's a unit in India&#13;
called a maund, which is 82 pounds; a bushel of wheat is 60 pounds--they came up with a sum&#13;
of, I don't know, 120 rupees or something, 128 rupees, per maund. And one of the members of&#13;
the Tonnage Club pulled out a checkbook and said, "I'll take the entire 16,000 tons at that price."&#13;
There was absolute consternation. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
                                             a&#13;
Eventually they settled on about 250 rupees maund for the wheat. It came in, and it went out.&#13;
It went out to big farmers. And the understanding was that they would not sell it. They would&#13;
not harvest it--I mean, they would not harvest it for sale. It could be harvested for seed. The&#13;
seed corporation of India, which had been formed earlier for other seeds--castor seeds and so on,&#13;
specialized crop seeds--would take it.&#13;
&#13;
And the harvest in ' 67 was a bumper harvest of this material. That meant there was enough to&#13;
put out for planting in autumn of '67. You harvest in March before the ground gets too hot.&#13;
&#13;
Before this occurred, the economics group at Delhi University under V.K.R.V. Rao, the head of&#13;
economics at Delhi University, decided to hold a meeting as to what we did on the food. And&#13;
Subramaniam came. He sat up at the back. It was hot. There were no fans on, no air-&#13;
conditioning or anything, just hot as hell and sweaty. This is the beginning of the hot season in&#13;
Delhi. And they brought in the economists, an array of economists, and every one of them&#13;
except for two, as Subramaniam pointed out--Hopper, and a guy by the name of Khilone&#13;
[phonetic], Professor Khilone [phonetic] from Punjab University--got up and said, "We do not&#13;
want the outside wheats. Don't bring them in." This was before we bought them, before&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    27&#13;
&#13;
Subramaniam decided to buy them. And Subramaniam sat quiet throughout the entire thing up at&#13;
the back.&#13;
&#13;
And Khilone [phonetic] and I were saying, "Yes, you need it. You need the food. It's the only&#13;
way you're going to do it. Yeah, you've got to get fertilizer for them. Agreed. Yes, they need&#13;
water, because they need extra irrigation, et cetera. Yes; all ofthat's correct."&#13;
&#13;
The economists were saying, "Look, this country was built on equality, and all that's going to&#13;
occur is that the Punjab, Haryana, these places that have water, western Uttar Pradesh, are going&#13;
to be way ahead of them on farmers. The people in Madhya Pradesh, et cetera, are going to be&#13;
still poor because they can't afford the water. It isn't there. They can't afford the fertilizer. It&#13;
isn't there," et cetera. This sort of thing. This was one thing.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing was, "Well, we don't know if they're going to really do it. We bring them in and&#13;
we pay all ofthis money, and they plant them, and then we have a bad year or the diseases get in&#13;
or we" et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. "Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it."&#13;
&#13;
Khilone [phonetic] and I just kind of commiserated and said, "Well, this isn't going to work. I&#13;
mean, it just isn't going to work."&#13;
&#13;
This is when Subramaniam got up in the back, and it was a Friday noon and said, well, he&#13;
appreciated very much being here. He had listened to the various arguments and so on. But he&#13;
said, "There are only two people in this room, Professor Khilone [phonetic] of Punjab and Dr.&#13;
Hopper of the Rockefeller Foundation, who addressed my problem, which is how do I feed my&#13;
people." And he walked out. That was Friday.&#13;
&#13;
Sunday, Cummings calls me and says, "He's going to send a mission. I just talked with Borlaug,&#13;
and they had better get there." They left. They came back. And in ' 68, India increased its wheat&#13;
production by 50 percent. The fall of '68 we harvested--wheat everywhere. God, the Punjab&#13;
was--in the schools and the railroad stations, everywhere, there was wheat.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: What was India's plan to sort of distribute and ...&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: They got it. They got it. It went to the--they created a food corporation to handle it.&#13;
They needed to build storage. The World Bank was there to help them build storage and so on.&#13;
This was it.&#13;
&#13;
Then the question was where do you get fertilizer because you need the fertilizer for it. I had&#13;
traveled every six weeks out of Delhi for a year and a half, visiting the U.S., Britain, Germany,&#13;
France, Canada and so on to get fertilizer. We got the fertilizer in for the '68.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: What kind of fertilizer?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: We needed urea in large quantities. That's nitrogen. We needed potash and&#13;
potassium--not potassium, god--NPK.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: That's what I was just thinking.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: It's NPK. It's potassium, yeah. We got it in. We brought in 250 million dollars&#13;
worth of fertilizer. The World Bank--I got the World Bank here; Crawford was involved in this-&#13;
-to switch its thing that they wouldn't finance an annual usable, and the World Bank put up&#13;
money. This wasn't--this was under-god, I forget his name; I'll think of it.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Was it Woods?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Yes. George Woods as the president. And he agreed; he got the Board [of&#13;
Executive Directors] to agree that they'd put in long-term IDA grant for this annual usable. We&#13;
got Canada to put up fertilizer. We got Germany to put up fertilizer. We got the French to put in&#13;
fertilizer. We got the Brits to put up some. We got it from various places. And we got 250&#13;
million dollars worth of fertilizer. And that went out to--and you'll find a paper in the--and I&#13;
don't recommend reading all that junk, but a paper in the Bell Mission report said, estimated it to&#13;
be around that, 250 million. This was when I went to the--actually, it was 280 million, I guess&#13;
we got, because it said 250 million--this is when I went to the secretary of finance earlier to ask&#13;
him about it and he said, "We fann the fields of Kansas and Saskatchewan. Don't be silly.&#13;
We're not going to produce our own food."&#13;
&#13;
The promissory notes were there and so on. The U.S. wrote off three and a half billion dollars&#13;
worth of promissory notes; Canada wrote off basically about a billion and a half. They built an&#13;
embassy or a new consulate--not a new consulate but a new High Commissioner building,&#13;
Canadian High Commission Buildin,g in Delhi. They created an institute called the Shastri Indo-&#13;
Canadian Institute in Canada with this money. I was instrumental in getting that done, and my&#13;
first wife signed the papers for it. I couldn't, but she did. This is how it worked. That was it.&#13;
&#13;
In '69--McNamara was impressed. He came out and saw this wheat and had a discussion with&#13;
me. That's when I first met him. He was now at the Bank. In '67, he came. He was very&#13;
impressed with what had been done on the wheat. We were doing this, now, the same thing with&#13;
some of the new rices coming in from the Rice Institute. They were a little more difficult&#13;
because it took irrigated land and so on and so forth and the rest of it.&#13;
&#13;
From then on, three A.M. in the morning, twice a week, the telephone would ring. I'd get up and&#13;
McNamara'd be on the line, wanting to know what things were going and what things were&#13;
doing, what's Mrs. Gandhi doing, and the rest of it.&#13;
&#13;
 By 1969, 1970, it was clear the Rockefeller function was pretty much done. And Harrar was&#13;
 now President of the Rockefeller, well, was President of the Rockefeller Foundation in New&#13;
 York, and he was not at all sure that we needed another role there. We'd moved the stuff in.&#13;
 The research was going. There were research institutions. India had good research institutions.&#13;
 The U.S. AID had built a whole series of Indian universities in India back, starting back in the&#13;
 '50s--Pantnagur in Uttar Pradesh, Ludhiana, and the others, down in Orissa, and so on and so&#13;
.forth. A lot of these kids were trained and a lot of the professors were trained in the United&#13;
 States. Many returned to India only to find that there wasn't really anything to do in India. They&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
continued their Ph.D. theses they had written in the U.S. and so on. Some of them went back to&#13;
the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
But Subramaniam had changed this. He was defeated in the '67 elections and was out and came&#13;
back in the '74 elections--or '72 elections--with Mrs. Gandhi and became finance minister.&#13;
&#13;
And in 1974 I was with the IDRC in Canada; I was asked to come back and head this thing up by&#13;
the Prime Minister, Maurice Strong. It was Canada's answer to the fact that, as I like to say, that&#13;
they didn't have a Mr. Ford or Mr. Rockefeller in Canada, so the Canadian government created a&#13;
government corporation--not a crown corporation, a government corporation--that would be--it&#13;
was called the International Development Research Center, or in French, the Centre de&#13;
Recherche pour la Developpement Internationale. I was brought in as the first president to set&#13;
this thing up, get it to function. I was there until McNamara invited me to the Bank. He'd made&#13;
the noises about my coming to the Bank as soon as I left India.&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAUL T: I was just going to ask, why did it take from ...&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Well, because I had this IDRC thing, and what he wanted me to do in the Bank was&#13;
to substitute for Warren Baum or something else. I--my own feeling was that this was&#13;
Machiavelli's The Prince, that there were courtiers and there were barons in that institution. And&#13;
the president dares not take on the barons as a group; otherwise, it's King John and Runnymede&#13;
and the Magna Carta again. But then the jobs he offered me--he offered me two jobs. Both were&#13;
courtiers' jobs, and I just didn't want to be a courtier. I was a baron sitting up in Canada. I had&#13;
my own budget, and I had a bunch of parliamentarians who were strong believers in what I was&#13;
doing, and I got, you know, votes in Parliament that were unanimous and so on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
But he did offer me--he said, "Well, what can I offer you?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, South Asia. That's the one place I'd come for."&#13;
&#13;
He offered me South Asia in '77, and I came down in '78. I'd had seven years at IDRC; that was&#13;
sufficient.&#13;
&#13;
But the--Subramaniam. 1974 I was with IDRC. I went to see Mrs. Gandhi, was in India. I went&#13;
to India frequently because I had a little office there, personal office, still functioning and so on&#13;
under IDRC, maintaining touch. I wanted to see Mrs. Gandhi, and I walked into her office. She&#13;
said, "Dave, do you know what that man said?" I didn't know who "that man" was, much less&#13;
worry about what he said. She said, "He said he might use food as a weapon. Now, you've been&#13;
telling me for years we can grow our own food. How do we do it?"&#13;
&#13;
"That man" was Henry Kissinger. And he said this after Saudi Arabia joined OPEC&#13;
[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]. And the U.S. was putting a lot of food into&#13;
Saudi Arabia as part of the balance in the oil deals and so on, and now Saudi Arabia was raising&#13;
the price of oil to us substantially. I mean big price increases. And Kissinger was just mad as&#13;
hell: "And, my God, sometimes I may have to use it as weapon."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now Mrs. G's concern was not Kissinger and his oil. Mrs. G's concern was that India was very&#13;
close to the Russians, and it could very well be that, you know, India's tete-a-tete with the&#13;
Russians--because a lot ofIndian stuff went to Russia, cashew nuts and you bought them tea and&#13;
so on and so forth. You bought them in London via the Russians and so on.&#13;
&#13;
And India had--she blew off a nuclear bomb after I'd warned her that she was going to have it--&#13;
or not warned her. I had warned Canada and the United States that they were working on a&#13;
nuclear bomb down in Calcutta--down in Bombay. I went down to put in a new computer that&#13;
Kenny [J. Kenneth] Galbraith had done, and I was one of the only ones around India that had&#13;
experience on computers that had more than one central processor. The one that I cut my eye&#13;
teeth on was the ILIAC out at Illinois. I went out and spent some time out there looking at how&#13;
they were doing it and so on and so forth when I was in Toronto at Guelph--at Chicago. I had&#13;
done some programming on multiple processor computers. I'd brought in some small computers&#13;
to Guelph, smaller ones. This was before the desktop was created and all the other stuff.&#13;
&#13;
But I got down to Bombay and went to the Tata Institute down there, research institute. They&#13;
had this computer. It was supposed to go to the statistical institute in Calcutta, the Indian&#13;
Statistical Institute in Calcutta, and that's where Galbraith thought it was going to go to, the&#13;
ambassador. And I went down and spent two weeks and came back. I went to see him and said,&#13;
"You know, they're going to build an atom bomb. That's what they want. They're using that&#13;
computer to handle higher-order differential equations. Now, there are no higher-order&#13;
differential equations in statistics that India does. There are higher-order differential equations&#13;
on uranium and so on and so forth and how you get it and what's the physics, but not Indian&#13;
statistics. "&#13;
&#13;
He couldn't accept it. Canada couldn't accept it. But when she blew the bomb off, we held an "I&#13;
told you so" party down at the Pearson Building in Canada, because some of my other friends&#13;
did accept it, that that's what was going on. [Homi Jehangir] Bhabha was killed--the physicist&#13;
handling this was killed in an airplane crash. An Air India plane hit Mont Blanc in Switzerland.&#13;
It was a major loss.&#13;
&#13;
I remember teasing Bhabha after the Chinese war in '62, you know: "Be careful."&#13;
&#13;
Bhabha said, "Well, we have to build an atom bomb."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, you haven't got enough--no engineering physicists to really do this. You only&#13;
have four in the country."&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Four? We've got fifty abroad. We'll bring them back."&#13;
&#13;
And when I reported this to Galbraith, they put special CIA [U.S. Central Intelligence Agency]&#13;
people--or the equivalent of such--on those four. They never left their jobs and so on and so&#13;
forth, and this was it. This was where the intelligence was. They never took a look at the&#13;
number coming in. I warned them. I saw them, you know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Well, she blew the bomb off in order to knock off the railroad strike in India. But she was very&#13;
concerned in '74--she blew it off in '74. This was before--this was the issue with Kissinger. I&#13;
remember I went to the telephone and I called Bob McNamara and said, "Bob, I just left Mrs.&#13;
Gandhi. We had a long conversation. I think she's ready for really moving on this, rather than&#13;
just farming the fields of Kansas and Saskatchewan."&#13;
&#13;
McNamara said, "You go back and tell her I'm willing to put two billion dollars over the next&#13;
five years into Indian agriculture."&#13;
&#13;
Well, I couldn't get to her. She had left elsewhere and I had other things to do, but Bob did.&#13;
They formed a committee consisting of Indians, senior Indians, and the Bank appointed Sir John&#13;
Crawford as their candidate, and he was the chairman of this committee. They met, Indians and&#13;
Bank people, under Sir John until I wrapped it up in the 1980s.&#13;
&#13;
Now, they moved from ..&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Was this the Consultative Group [for International Agricultural Research]?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: No, no, totally different. The CGIAR--that's another story and I'll come ba'ck to&#13;
that, if you will.&#13;
&#13;
I'm talking Indian food. This was an Indian commission. And they moved from the tonnages&#13;
that you had in ' 68--wheat expansion and so on, 100 to 125 million tons and so on--they moved&#13;
up to what is today a billion tons. I mean, they're feeding a billion people. When I left--there&#13;
were not a billion tons of food--when I left there were 490 million people in 1970. They're now&#13;
a billion, 100 million or close to that. A billion, 70 million is the official statistic. They're&#13;
exporting. They're growing more wheat than the United States. They're growing more--the&#13;
second largest rice producer, after China. They are able to export wheat. Right now they had a&#13;
bumper, bumper year just finished, about 230 million tons or so total, total food grains.&#13;
&#13;
This is historic. It's, quote, "the Green Revolution," unquote. That's what it was. It rests&#13;
basically--the term "green revolution" (I once looked it up) was a revolution of the peasantry in&#13;
Poland back in the 15th century. But the term was used by L((e magazine when they visited the&#13;
Rice Institute and talked ..&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: In the Philippines.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: In the Philippines. They had got some dwarf rices, thanks to the Japanese, through&#13;
Taichung, Taiwan, Japanese left some dwarf material. They brought that in. They developed the&#13;
dwarf rice, which--IR8 blew the lid off yields in rice. They continue to handle these dwarf&#13;
materials and so on. Eventually, those are the ones that have moved in on the rice areas and&#13;
greatly added to them.&#13;
&#13;
Now, Consultative Group. In 1969 we had this wheat story. Hill and Harrar had now built-&#13;
they'd converted the Rockefeller group into CIMMYT [International Maize and Wheat&#13;
Improvement Center]. They'd built the Rice Institute in the Philippines in '62. Hill had to--a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       W. David Hopper&#13;
                             April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
very, very--first meeting of the board, Hill was--Harrar was in the chair. Hill kind of went&#13;
around and said, "Okay, what do you do?" "I'm a beet scientist," that was there. They brought&#13;
in various scientists from all over: Taiwan, from various other places, India, and so on, and the&#13;
United States. And Hill went around the table and asked each one of them.&#13;
&#13;
One of them, an American scientist from South Carolina--Hill said what did he think. He said,&#13;
"This is the institute, this is the Rockefeller University for rice."&#13;
&#13;
Hill said, "What do you mean by that?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, you know, there's a lot ofthings interesting about rice. Rice has more silicon in&#13;
its cellular structure. It's a high silicate. How does it get the silica? Where does it get it from?&#13;
It gets it from the soiL How does it separate out silica? That's a very, very--that's sand. It's a&#13;
very difficult thing. It has silicon and carbon, but it mixes the silicon with the carbon. Where&#13;
does it get it? Secondly, rice is anaerobic. It really doesn't rely on the water environment, but&#13;
it's not an environment in which there's going to be a lot of microorganisms and so on and so&#13;
forth available. How does it get this? Where does it get its oxygen from? At least in the forest&#13;
plants where you get oxygen and so on, they put up leaves from the roots to take the oxygen out.&#13;
Where does it get its oxygen from? How does it get its oxygen?" And he went through a series&#13;
of these things.&#13;
&#13;
Hill looked at him and said, "Look, the job ofthis thing is to double rice yields in Asia in the&#13;
next ten years. If you think it's going to be done with knowing about oxygen and knowing about&#13;
silicon and so on, fine, but you're going to have to convince me. What we want to do is double&#13;
rice yields."&#13;
&#13;
And the press were absolutely--they opened it up, and the press were there.&#13;
&#13;
And they took four plots outside the Rice Institute in the Philippines. The first plot: the way the'&#13;
Filipino farmers farm rice. The second plot: the way the college of agriculture tells them to&#13;
farm rice. The third plot: the way we do it in Texas, Hank [Henry M.] Beachell, Mr. Rice in the&#13;
United States, Hank had his sign out. The fourth plot was Sterling Wortman, who was the&#13;
Deputy Director, and Sterling was a very good guy.&#13;
&#13;
Sterling had visited me in India. As he came through, he said, "I'm not going to let you damned&#13;
economists tell me what to do." Sterling was head of the Pineapple Institute in Hawaii; before&#13;
that he was with CIMMYT, with the Rockefeller program in Mexico, the early Rockefeller&#13;
program. "I'm going to show you what rice will do. I'm going to really show you what rice will&#13;
do."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Fine."&#13;
&#13;
Okay, the press arrived for the opening salvoes and so on. All these little plots were out here,&#13;
and the rice was around about yay-high. That's what they took pictures of. Then they did what&#13;
the press should never do: they followed it up. They harvested. They were there when they cut&#13;
these plots. And the first plot was four tons per hectare of rice, a good Filipino yield. The&#13;

second plot was three tons per hectare, but we always knew the college of agriculture wasn't all&#13;
that good. Hank Beachell's plot, Mr. Rice from Texas A&amp;M [University], was one ton per&#13;
hectare. So much for the Americans. Wortman's plot--they harvested the damnedest crop of&#13;
straw and not one head of rice, not one grain of rice. The press had a ball with this, you know,&#13;
10 billion dollar Institute, these highly-paid gringos that are here and so on, all they did was&#13;
demonstrate that the Filipino farmer knew how to farm rice. And it was-it was blind.&#13;
&#13;
Frosty--I was in New York, fertilizer again--Frosty asked me to go back to the Rice Institute and&#13;
go back through there to see what's going on. When I arrived, everybody was in the doldrums.&#13;
God, it was ...&#13;
&#13;
Okay. What they did was to get their geneticist--who was the guy who said, "This is what we&#13;
needed to know, how to get the silicon, and the rest of if'--to talk with the Japanese that they got&#13;
on. Now, the Japanese came from Hokkaido, up in northern Japan, and was considered to be&#13;
quite eminent in the rice field, but his English wasn't very good. The more scotch you poured&#13;
into him, the better his English was. They dumped about, I guess--Chivas Regal is what he&#13;
wanted to drink--they dumped, I don't know, a case of Chivas Regal into him or something. He&#13;
began talking about what they did in Taiwan. They had a Taiwanese on the staff that they&#13;
brought in from Taiwan, Taichung. He said, "Yes, yes, the Japanese rice--the dwarf rices--the&#13;
Japanese--that's in Taichung."&#13;
&#13;
So they brought the Taichung genes down. They crossed those with an Indonesian rice, and they&#13;
produced IR8. They did a whole series of these crosses. And as Beachell would tell you, what&#13;
Borlaug would tell you also, and that is, that when you're dealing in these developing countries,&#13;
you can get 25,000 crosses, whereas the best you could do in the United States is maybe two&#13;
hundred because it's expensive to trace them. They crossed all over the place. I went out with&#13;
Beachell to look at some of this stuff that was crossed, and it was-he was cutting them and so&#13;
on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
But they separated out the IR8 from the others, a little short plant like this that just stood up to&#13;
the winds and produced rice like crazy. Nobody had ever heard of eight tons--not even in Texas-&#13;
-and that's what they got. So that became one ofthe things. But this was later. This was in the&#13;
60s--'64, '65, et cetera. Borlaug's wheats had come in '62, and we got them.&#13;
&#13;
Okay, rice and wheat are now well in hand in India. We did the same thing with sorghums. We&#13;
did the same thing with jowar or the different plant foods and so on and so forth. The&#13;
Rockefeller program was a big program, and it just passed it over to the Indians.&#13;
&#13;
In '69, Hill and--and they had formed two other institutes. They had the Rice Institute they&#13;
formed out of the Mexican thing. They created another one down at CIA T [International Center&#13;
for Tropical Agriculture], which was the Columbia program, the old Columbia program of the&#13;
Rockefeller Foundation. And this is the agriculture in-it's in, oh god, names--anyway, it's in&#13;
CIA T. CIA T' s in Columbia outside of Bogota but--down to Cali; if s in Cali, just outside of&#13;
Cali. And they created a new one in Ibadan, Nigeria, called liTA, the International Institute for&#13;
Tropical Agriculture. And it was going to deal with rain forests and not so--the northern areas,&#13;
which are desert. And the two foundations--Hill said twenty years to the Rockefeller Foundation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
for IRRI [International Rice Research Institute], and then he added these other three institutes.&#13;
Harrar did the same thing, and then they decided this was getting pretty rich for their blood, so&#13;
Hill decided let's do something.&#13;
&#13;
They got a hold of McNamara and they got a hold of--oh, what's his name, who was with the,&#13;
the head of the UNDP [United Nations Development Program]. (I'll think of his name, too.)&#13;
They got them to sponsor, along with the World Bank, a meeting at Bellagio in Italy, in which&#13;
the Rockefeller--there's a Rockefeller villa that they hold up in Bellagio. It was given to them by&#13;
the Rockefeller Foundation back in the 1950s. It's a beautiful villa, absolutely gorgeous. It sits&#13;
on Lake Bellagio. It sits up high and so on. And they brought the heads of the donor agency,&#13;
had Maurice Strong from Canada, and the French, and the Norwegians, and the Brits, the U.S.,&#13;
and so on--to this meeting&#13;
&#13;
They brought a group of us in to present the thing. I was with the group. Hill brought somebody&#13;
in from Madison Avenue, an advertising agency, to check us out. We gave a scientific&#13;
presentation, had 150 slides and so on.&#13;
&#13;
The guy from Madison A venue said, "How many?" because we met with him first.&#13;
&#13;
We said, "150."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "ISO? Twenty!"&#13;
&#13;
We went through this--we worked until two a.m. in the morning going through this damn&#13;
presentation. Well, he just--"What are you saying? It's either this way or it's not." It was a very&#13;
simpleton--Oeorge Bush "You're either with me or agin' me," you know. "Don't keep&#13;
modifying it. 'The evidence seems to be,' et cetera." He said, "It's either there or it isn't there.&#13;
You either have the wheat or you didn't have it." We had pictures of the wheat, so we have it.&#13;
&#13;
We made the presentation the next day. It went over magnificently, a lot of discussion over the&#13;
lunch period late in the afternoon and so on. That evening they had a pianist come in and play&#13;
the piano and so on. We had things to drink after dinner. And the discussions got tighter and&#13;
tighter, as the outside agencies are saying, "How do we do it? I mean, we give money to&#13;
countries. We don't give money to institutes and so on."&#13;
&#13;
And the next day, it just boiled up. And suddenly McNamara banged the table and said, "Damn&#13;
it! We've all been concerned with agriculture. We've all failed on it. Here's the one thing we&#13;
have that's succeeded. Now let's do something about it, and we can't let it go."&#13;
&#13;
And Maurice Strong from Canada was sitting there, and Maurice said, "Bob, you've got a CO&#13;
for just about everything. Why don't you have one for agricultural research?"&#13;
&#13;
And McNamara looked at him and said, "That's a good idea. Would you support it?"&#13;
&#13;
And around the table was, "Yeah, we would." The Bank would run this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So McNamara came back. This was '69. We had a meeting, another meeting of the technicians.&#13;
I was now with IDRC--I was with Rockefeller at that time--I was now with the IDRC in Canada,&#13;
just starting it. We had a meeting with the technicians, others around the table, to how do we&#13;
create this and what do we do. February of '70. Then we met two or three times. McNamara&#13;
had a hell of a time getting it through his board, getting it through the countries, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Why do you think that was?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Well, because it was different. I mean, you know, a consultative group for--the&#13;
consortium that India had and Pakistan had was replaced by the aid groups. The aid groups, they&#13;
didn't want the pledges, so we didn't have pledges. Then we moved from that point to--well, we&#13;
didn't--the first aid groups met and no pledges. And everybody said, "Well, what are we doing&#13;
really? What are we doing? We've got to have pledges."&#13;
&#13;
So the aid group, they came down and they said, "Are you really going to put the money up or&#13;
are you not?"&#13;
&#13;
Well, then there was complaining: "if you move to Africa and the rest of it, how are we going to&#13;
pledge this? We've got problems. We don't know what's going on," et cetera, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
So that became consultative group, CGs. So we now had a consultative group for this. This is&#13;
where the donors meet and sit around and consult as to what they were going to put into these&#13;
centers and create new ones.&#13;
&#13;
He got it through the board eventually. And we had a meeting in December of '70 up in the Ford&#13;
Foundation in New York, in which it was all set to go. And the major meeting then was to be&#13;
done with the countries in March of '71, and that's when the CG was created basically.&#13;
&#13;
And we've added to them. It's now sixteen institutes.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: I went on their web site and noticed there's now a fisheries institute.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Yes. Well, there's a fisheries institute. There's a couple of forestry institutes. I was&#13;
chairman of the CG when the forestry institute was created, and we didn't want another CG, so&#13;
we kind of added it in. And the foresters lined up and an awful lot of others did to protect the&#13;
tropical forests and all the rest of it.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Okay. One question I had-I mean, just speaking of the Green Revolution&#13;
there's been a lot of talk back and forth about the pros and cons and critiques of it and all that.&#13;
How did you feel in the' 80s when it got criticized and all the work that you had seen done and&#13;
the accomplishments that had happened?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: I ignored it, and I still ignore it. I mean, I pick these things up. I read about them&#13;
and so on and so forth. There's good friends of mine who have been involved and so on and so&#13;
forth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       36&#13;
&#13;
Look, the population growth is still there. And if you listen to Lester Brown and read his Plan B,&#13;
"We've got two years before we run into global food shortage again." Well, all right. We've got&#13;
a global food surplus at the present moment.&#13;
&#13;
We're putting three billion dollars--or, sorry, 312 billion dollars a year into food or agricultural&#13;
subsidies in this country, Europe, and Japan. The developing countries are raising hell with&#13;
Cancun [trade negotiations] and the WTO [World Trade Organization] and so on and so forth&#13;
because the one export that they've got, they can't export. You've got a bunch of sugar guys&#13;
who are moving the candy manufacturing out of Chicago and elsewhere because they can buy&#13;
sugar more cheaply someplace else than they can in the United States because we've got a big,&#13;
big sugar subsidy, going down to Florida to build sugar.&#13;
&#13;
Canada is sitting on oranges because, thank God, we don't produce oranges and we can buy them&#13;
in from BraziL The US is raising hell because it's outside of the Canadian agreement with the&#13;
U.S. Well, we blended that agreement into NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement].&#13;
"So can we buy the oranges from Mexico?"&#13;
&#13;
"No," because they've got a subsidy going to oranges in California and Texas--Texas&#13;
particularly--and Florida.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: We're going to have GM [genetically modified] crops, regardless of what you say.&#13;
Eventually, in my view, agriculture is going to be "Why the hell do we need a cow to get beef&#13;
when we know the chemicals and the genes that are going to produce it? Why don't we just put&#13;
those genes into a mill, feed in the appropriate materials, and slice it off the beef steaks coming&#13;
off the bottom of this? What do you have to have a cow for?" That's far-fetched, but this is--no,&#13;
we're going to do far more than this. The Europeans--the Africans can't take GM crops because,&#13;
you know, it may affect what they're doing. They'll get around this. The Indians are now well&#13;
into it. We have the whole issue of trade relations and money going off to the side, saying, you&#13;
know, "The Indians should not be growing these new soybeans that they've got or the soy&#13;
materials because they're stealing our patented and trademarked or copyrighted materials, and&#13;
that's ours." The Indians are going like this.&#13;
&#13;
So it's now into a global, whole global set of relationships. And the globalization is just adding&#13;
to this. The U.S. just announced on the AIDS thing that the pharmaceuticals don't want to be&#13;
seen using genetic material on AIDS materials. Well, that's fine. India has a big pharmaceutical&#13;
industry. They're going to produce it, and they're going to sell it, and they're going to sell it&#13;
cheap. And here we are. "Okay, we'll go to court," Okay, this is great for the lawyers. My&#13;
wife's a lawyer, my present wife's a lawyer, so we'll go to court and watch it. And I have a son&#13;
who's an intellectual property lawyer down in Austin. We're going down to see our&#13;
grandchildren down there very shortly.&#13;
&#13;
But it's a, it's a--regardless of what we say, this is going to move forward. And we are going to&#13;
be moving into higher yields. You can say, "Okay, India has reached the peak ofthis." I don't&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         W. David Hopper&#13;
                               April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
think India has reached the peak at all. But it's going to mean a very different kind of fertilizer.&#13;
It's going to mean a very different kind of game. I'm not an organic food buff. I really do feel&#13;
that soils need some organic materials, and it's not going to be easy to get the way we got them&#13;
before, which is just let the straw lie and put the cattle in and run sheep across them and so on.&#13;
That's what the Indian farmers did when I lived in the village. You brought the shepherds in,&#13;
and they ran the sheep in the field and proceeded to make sure that they did their droppings on&#13;
the field so that you had it. All right. We now can do it with dust and fertilizer.&#13;
&#13;
Back in 1957 there was a meeting of the International Agricultural Economics Society. I didn't&#13;
have any way to go to it, so I didn't go to it. But Earl Heady was there from the University of&#13;
Iowa, and Earl gave me a call and could I send him somewhere. So I sent him in to talk with&#13;
Ramdari Baba [phonetic] in myoId village. Earl went in. He had a chat with Ramdari Baba&#13;
[phonetic], and he asked Ramdari [phonetic] did he use fertilizer. Ramdari [phonetic] said no.&#13;
Now, he went in with the agricultural officer ofthe district and so on and so forth and a big&#13;
entourage and the rest of it. What did I say? ' 57 is when. The entourage. He walked into the&#13;
Village. They had a good conversation with Ramdari Baba [phonetic] through an interpreter and&#13;
soon.&#13;
&#13;
Then he called me to say that he had spoken with Ramdari [phonetic]. He asked if Ramdari&#13;
[phonetic] used fertilizer, and Ramdari [phonetic] said no.&#13;
&#13;
Heady said, "Why not?"&#13;
&#13;
Ramdari [phonetic] said, "I can't afford it. I can't buy it."&#13;
&#13;
Heady came back to call me to say, "What was the price and why was this?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Ead, Ramdari [phonetic] could buy you out tomorrow. He's got more damn gold&#13;
bangles around the house and the rest of it than you can shake a stick at." I said, "He's worth at&#13;
least ten million dollars. What do you mean he can't afford it? I'll tell you why he doesn't use&#13;
it, because it doesn't work." I said, "I tried it on my field when I was there. He was very&#13;
interested. I didn't--the second crop that I took, I didn't pay as him much. I still paid him&#13;
because the plant I used was Punjab 591, which is the accepted plant, and the fertilizer caused it&#13;
to grow up and it lodged. The same that happened down at IRRI with the rice: put on the&#13;
fertilizer, and the rice fell over. So I paid him another go-round on this. The fertilizer doesn't&#13;
work, and he knows it doesn't work."&#13;
&#13;
So I go back to the village in '62, and I'm sitting down with Ramdari [phonetic]. I say to him,&#13;
"You know, you had Professor Heady here."&#13;
&#13;
"Yeah. It was a good discussion."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What did you tell him you couldn't afford fertilizer for?"&#13;
&#13;
"Oh," he said, "it's simple." He said, "IfI said I can't get it, the agriculture guys would have it&#13;
down here. I don't want it. IfI said that it's very--that it doesn't work, then I'm going to get a&#13;
&#13;

                               April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
debate from Heady or from the agriculture people. 'Yes, yes, it works. It works. It works. The&#13;
Americans tell me it works. '" He said, "Tell them you're poor. Everybody knows an Indian&#13;
farmer is poor." [Laughter] So here we are.&#13;
&#13;
Now this iSM-the Green Revolution guys in this part of the world are writing not in objection to&#13;
the Green Revolution--I'm sorry, in objecting to the Green Revolution. It's done by American&#13;
scholars, et cetera, who either visit or don't or whatever else. Go to India. India, the Green&#13;
Revolution is still talked about. It's still working. It's still doing things. It's demanding of the&#13;
government better irrigation, demanding of the government more water, demanding of the&#13;
government more fertilizer. India is the second-largest user of high-quality fertilizer. China uses&#13;
more fertilizer, but it's not the real quality that India is getting. India is importing it.&#13;
&#13;
You go up into the Punjab, and what are they doing? They're producing strawberries for export,&#13;
a whole series of things. They're into fancier crops. They're not growing grain anymore up&#13;
there. They use the irrigation water for a whole set of vegetables, of other things. They're&#13;
exporting. They're exporting into Pakistan. That's illegal. No, what occurs--they go down.&#13;
They take the ships and they move over to Dubai and the Emirates, and they bring all of that into&#13;
Karachi and they sell it. And what you can buy a big chunk of fertilizer for, or what you can buy&#13;
strawberries for in India--the equivalent oftwenty-five cents a can or something else, or aseer,&#13;
two pounds, two and a half pounds--you buy in Karachi for a buck twenty-five. It comes in via&#13;
Dubai, and everybody's happy. Sure. But it's--this is the game. And that's what's going on in&#13;
India in agriculture. It's totally revolutionizing it.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the rural areas are poor, yes. You've got a billion, 100 million people, seventy percent of&#13;
them live in the rural areas still. The others have all moved into the urban centers, and the urban&#13;
centers are now our call centers, and we bitch about the off-shore and the rest of it, and I feel&#13;
sorry for the Americans that get screwed on this. But the out-sourcing is there. It's there for&#13;
intellectual property. It's there for IT [information technology]. The World Bank does all its&#13;
checks and so on and so forth out of India. They're all transmitted. IT&amp;T makes a hell of a lot&#13;
of money on their transmission cables, the optical fiber cables that they put in connecting India,&#13;
Hong Kong, and the rest of it into the United States and so on. And all of that goes out. This is&#13;
where the call centers operate through. So it's, it's--the changes are huge.&#13;
&#13;
And today's election in India is now being built on the youth. The BJP, this great Hindu fascist&#13;
party that I was always frightened of, et cetera--the BJP are now torn between young people who&#13;
are saying, "Forget it. Let's go after the rural areas. What do the rural people want? Bijli,&#13;
sarak,pani." This is power, roads, water, telecommunications, satellite things, opportunities to&#13;
hook onto Internet, and so on. You now have TV serving 200-well, about 500,000 villages.&#13;
There's 550,000 villages in India. Some ofthe others up in the hills don't quite get it.&#13;
&#13;
But, you know, when Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in Tamil Nadu by this woman from Sri&#13;
Lanka who blew herself up and blew him up, as the prime minister and the rest of it, the&#13;
government oflndia said, "Okay, nOM-nothing on the TV, nothing on the radio with regard to&#13;
Gandhi's assassination for twelve and a half hours while we move troops because there may be&#13;
riots." 350,000 villages had TV sets. They were fix-tuned to an Indian satellite up over the&#13;
Indian Ocean. And like my little guy living in the village, I told them when they did this, told&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
[V. K. Krishna] Menon, "Forget it, because what's going to occur is these guys are going to&#13;
come in, take your dish satellite and put a worm gear onto it to hook it into the American and the&#13;
British and Russian satellites down here." And that's exactly what happened. A bunch of guys&#13;
came in, shifted the satellites.&#13;
&#13;
Madonna and that group are one of the favorite programs in the Indian villages, all right? So&#13;
they sit and listen, and what broke into Madonna? Rajiv's assassination. India knew about the&#13;
assassination within three minutes of the assassination, and the government ofIndia sits there&#13;
and wanted to know how did they know this. People are talking about it. There's no news.&#13;
There's nothing. Well, you know ...&#13;
&#13;
And [Lal Krishna] Advani decided he was going to do a great Hindu trek around India. This is&#13;
the Deputy Prime Minister and the basic one of the Hindu group. Advani--this is all planned out&#13;
and so on-and the youthjust simply said, "No." They don't want to go to these things. There's&#13;
no point in holding great Hindu ceremonies and Brahmins doing their, painting your forehead&#13;
and lighting their fires and making all the mantras and the rest of it that go with this. And they&#13;
forced him to cut it down. He didn't cut it out, no, but they forced him to greatly cut it down and&#13;
to go talk economics. That reminds me of old [William J.] Clinton's slogan on the wall, "It's the&#13;
economy, stupid." [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAULT: It might be revived. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Anyway, we got away from the World Bank, and I've been talking long.&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAUL T: Well, World Bank and development. I mean, I have questions specifically on the&#13;
World Bank but also just, you know, development ideas and concepts and that kind of stuff. But&#13;
I think what we probably should do is maybe stop here and set a time in May to do the second&#13;
one and talk about the latter period. And that way you'll also get to see the transcript ofthis and&#13;
make any notes or comments or fill anything out that you want.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Yeah. What we talked about here is not my period at the Bank, really.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: But I think it's a formative period of you getting to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: That's right. That's exactly what it is.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: And the sociology of knowledge that comes along.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: And this is--I mean, it was McNamara who invited me in. We worked like that. It&#13;
was really very good. I didn't have any deep arguments with him or anything else.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: Right. And that was something that I wanted to get into, I think, in the second&#13;
one, talking about, you know, his development philosophy, your development philosophy, and&#13;
how they worked together to kind of move forward, and then what happened in the' 80s when he&#13;
left.&#13;

                                        Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
 HOPPER: I'm W. David Hopper. It's the l2th of May, 2004. You asked about the Bank&#13;
 archives having relatively little on my personal activities as Vice President of South Asia. There&#13;
 are three reasons for this. One is that I came to theM-accepted the position of Vice President for&#13;
 South Asia after having known Bob McNamara, who was then the President, since, for about a&#13;
.decade. He took over at the Bank in 1967. I saw him in India in 1968. I was connected with&#13;
 some other activities that he had through the Rockefeller Foundation, and I was working for the&#13;
 Rockefeller Foundation at the time, 1969, but I was living in New Delhi. I used to get telephone&#13;
 calls from him about every--about twice a week, 3 A.M. in the morning my time, as we&#13;
 discussed the issue of food production in India.&#13;
&#13;
I was quite close, as I think I said before, to Mrs. Gandhi, who was then Prime Minister, and to&#13;
members of her cabinet. I had been an advisor to the Ministry of Food and Agriculture in India&#13;
and the Planning Commission. I had been on two or three Indian committees that took a look at&#13;
different things, everything from energy to food production and so on. I was known to the&#13;
Reserve Bank of India, and I was down in Bombay several times on the issues of that kind and at&#13;
Bombay University.&#13;
&#13;
When I came to the Bank in January 1978, McNamara as President had offered me two other&#13;
posts as potentially in--neither post intrigued me because they were both what I'm going to call,&#13;
using Machiavelli's The Prince in which Machiavelli divides up the courtiers from the barons-&#13;
and the posts which he wanted me or had offered me or asked if I was interested in were both&#13;
courtier posts.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: Okay. What were those posts?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: One was the general supervision of project activities that were going on. The other&#13;
was related to the general stance of the Bank under his new reorganization which created vice&#13;
presidencies for different areas. We had talked about a Vice President for Africa, and I had said,&#13;
well, I might be interested, but I didn't speak French sufficiently well to feel that I was&#13;
comfortable there. I had been in Africa. I had been in several countries in Africa--Nigeria,&#13;
Kenya, Ethiopia, and so on--when I was with the Rockefeller Foundation and before that with&#13;
the Ford Foundation. But Asia was much more my field, and the Asia post was not open. But he&#13;
wanted somebody to kind of take a look at the broad issues that related to planning projects and&#13;
that sort of thing, and that did not intrigue me. This was kind of in-house, and I would be a&#13;
courtier.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank at that time was divided between the courtiers and the barons. I was Vice President&#13;
for South Asia. It was an area I knew very well. I spoke Bhojpuri and Hindi. I could get along&#13;
in what is Urdu or Hindustani and kutcha Urdu. I used the term kutcha and pukka. I'll use that&#13;
periodically. Kutcha means a mud house, an unpaved road, a dessert that doesn't taste very&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 42&#13;
&#13;
good. It's kutcha. Pukka means a brick house, a paved road, a dessert that is really very good,&#13;
or a meal that is very good. It's a pukka meal; it's a pukka this; it's a pukka that. Hindustani&#13;
was, as a language, kind of borrowed from the Portuguese, the British, the Dutch, and so on and&#13;
Indian terms. This was what they generally spoke. All India kind of knew Hindustani, one form&#13;
or another. Urdu was an Arabic written language but was close to Hindustani. You understood&#13;
it back and forth. So I spoke some Hindustani, and I spoke a more pukka Hindi, and I spoke a&#13;
village dialect known as Bhojpuri. In all these cases, I spoke in kutcha terms.&#13;
&#13;
But the--I did not feel it necessary to--I traveled to India with some frequency. I visited Pakistan&#13;
with frequency. I was on first-name basis with not just th~ prime minister but the President of&#13;
Pakistan, [Muhammad] Zia-ul-Haq, flew around in his airplane, saw different things going on. I&#13;
was aware of Tarbela Dam before Pakistan--before I came to the Bank. I had visited Asia with a&#13;
great deal of activity. Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, et cetera, were kind of home countries that I knew.&#13;
And I didn't feel it necessary in dealing with my staff or otherwise to put out memos or anything&#13;
else with regard to this.&#13;
&#13;
I went to the aid consortiums. I knew more about what was going on in these countries and with&#13;
the country delegations than any other delegation around the table. It wasn't necessary. I ran the&#13;
consortiums. I had a reputation of being a very, very balanced but tough chairman. I could talk&#13;
to the Indian or Pakistani or Sri Lankan or Bangladeshi, et cetera, groups that came to these aid&#13;
group meetings or consortium meetings. And India and Pakistan were consortiums; the others&#13;
were aid groups. And there was a difference in supposedly what was done, but under me there&#13;
wasn't much difference.&#13;
&#13;
FELT AULT: Lending practices or ...&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: No. The consortium started off in 1958 with-oh, god. I suffer from what is now&#13;
known as double-A-M-I. It used to be called M-C-I, mild cognitive impairment, but they've&#13;
decided that M-C-I was kind of the beginning of Alzheimer's. But it occurs with older people.&#13;
It is now called double-A-M-I because it doesn't necessarily lead into Alzheimer's. Double-A-&#13;
M-I is age-associated memory impairment. And I have difficulty remembering names,&#13;
particularly, not geography but names. I can find my way around in a great many areas. And I'll&#13;
think of them very frequently after you go. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
FEL T AULT: Just write them down. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: The President of the World Bank at the time, Gene Black, Eugene Black--India had&#13;
a crisis, Pakistan had a crisis in 1957 when the food production dropped, and I think I mentioned&#13;
that before. This led the Bank then, under Black, to be concerned because they had loaned&#13;
money to India on fairly high interest rates and so on, standard interest rates in the Bank, and&#13;
India made it quite clear that they were having difficulty paying it off. So Black worked with the&#13;
U.S. government to create what is known as IDA. IDA came out of this, and India was an IDA&#13;
country. And that's where we put long-term loans, three-quarters of one percent interest rates,&#13;
ten-year grace, forty-year repayment period, a fifty-year loan, basically.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He also decided to create a consortia for India of aid donors who were interested in coming to&#13;
India. That was the consortia. It was created in 1958, and I was there at its 25 th anniversary.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Okay. He established the consortia. He built IDA. He arranged for the Bank to do&#13;
something it had never done before, which was to lengthen the loan periods on original loans for&#13;
poorer countries, low-income countries, and India was one of these. Now that the Bank has&#13;
denied kind of providing it to individual countries, but he just moved it blanket-wise, and the&#13;
Board, governing Board agreed to this. He opened up an office in Delhi, which was the first real&#13;
office outside of the World Bank. It was never a very powerful office; at least it wasn't then.&#13;
That's changed with Jim [James D.] Wolfensohn. But it was an office that kept a dialogue going&#13;
with the government of India, and I was part of that.&#13;
&#13;
I found it easy to go. I mean, I could arrive in India or in Pakistan, et cetera, and have private&#13;
conversations with them and decide this is where we want to go, come back and tell my staff,&#13;
and this was it. It wasn't necessary, or at least I didn't feel it necessary, to make substantial&#13;
notes or to dictate that this was my conversation with Zia-ul-Haq, et cetera. Indeed, there were&#13;
conversations with several of these people that they would be upset and distressed if they'd&#13;
known that I had put them down in notes because it's not part of what was there.&#13;
&#13;
The records that you have on South Asia in the archives are records that occurred when we did&#13;
projects, when we did other things, and where my advice and working with my Bank staff&#13;
closely was, "Okay, I'll check this out or I'll discuss it or this is what I'm getting when my&#13;
feedback is in there."&#13;
&#13;
An example of this, which is a story that--I'm not sure I want to put this in the notes, but&#13;
anyway, I may strike out some ofthese things. But Zia-ul-Haq was a military man who had&#13;
taken over when Pakistan got into deep difficulty with the elected representatives and so on.&#13;
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had taken over, and Bhutto--one of the first things that Bhutto did (and I was&#13;
then in Canada at Ottawa at the IDRC) was to call a meeting, a first meeting, of the Islamic&#13;
states. You'd had Arab groups. You'd had others. This was a big, big Islamic conference that&#13;
brought everybody from Indonesia to Morocco into the picture and up into Afghanistan and&#13;
Turkmenistan and so on, central Asia. They were part of the Russian picture, but they sent&#13;
delegates to this. It was held in Lahore.&#13;
&#13;
And Bhutto called for the establishment of an Islamic group. Roosevelt had called the United&#13;
States the "Arsenal of Democracy" in the Second World War, and that the U.S. then provided the&#13;
airplanes and so on. It wasn't until Pearl Harbor that they actually entered the war, but they were&#13;
doing an awful lot of support to Britain and the rest of it after the fall of France. It was the&#13;
arsenal of democracy. What he wanted was an arsenal for Islam, an Islamic arsenal. That would&#13;
mean that he put in a steel mill, which they didn't have in any of the Islamic countries. And they&#13;
did; they put one down at Karachi or outside of Karachi. It meant that--among the things that he&#13;
said is that, "You know, we have a Christian bomb"--United States, Britain, and so on--"We&#13;
have an atheist bomb"--this is the Russians' hydrogen bomb or the--not a hydrogen bomb, but,&#13;
oh, anyway, whatever the metal is; I'll think of it in a moment--"We have an Oriental bomb,"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
namely, China's discovery of the bomb. This is '74, so everything went back to this area. "We&#13;
have a French bomb, a European bomb. What we need is an Islamic bomb."&#13;
&#13;
That led them then to start negotiations under Bhutto with China in terms of building a potential&#13;
Pakistani bomb or Islamic bomb. And the discussions that you're reading now about [Abdul&#13;
Qadeer] Khan providing materials for a bomb, just an ordinary bomb to, that is a--what's the&#13;
term I want? Uranium bomb--providing uranium materials, U-235, which is a separated thing, or&#13;
even plutonium, which is a step up in the uranium, natural uranium. Providing those bombs was&#13;
all part of this Islamic bomb thing--Libya, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
Okay, Bhutto was a pain in the neck of the army. He began to try to build too much. He was a&#13;
Sindhi, and the bulk of the army is Punjabi, and there is no love lost between the Sindhisand the&#13;
Punjabis. The Punjabis came in from the west and came in from British India and so on and so&#13;
forth. The Sindhis were kind of very comfortable in the southern area around the Indus River&#13;
and Islamic but not--they didn't feel the muscles. They were not the military group; the Punjabis&#13;
were. And when Bhutto began mucking around with this and beginning to hit the army et cetera,&#13;
the army decided he had to go.&#13;
&#13;
He was--Zia-ul-Haq came in, and one of his main problems was getting rid of Bhutto. I once&#13;
advised Zia-ul-Haq that he ought to send him offto--as they did with a good friend of mine in&#13;
Egypt, send him to Finland as the Egyptian ambassador to Finland and picked up his passport so&#13;
he had to sit there. I suggested to Bhutto that he might send--or said to Zia-ul-Haq that he might&#13;
send Bhutto, oh, maybe to Cyprus or Norway or somewhere and just let him sit. Unfortunately,&#13;
the army said no, and he was hanged for, as far as I was concerned, a rather stupid accident that&#13;
he got into, and somebody was killed, and Bhutto was considered the cause of it. By the way,&#13;
his daughter has recently been in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
But Haq wanted--they built Tarbela Dam; they wanted to build Kalabagh. This is a big dam that&#13;
the Bank had gone on, we had gone with, et cetera. It was on the Indus River. It would have&#13;
been a marvelous addition. But I couldn't get them to sign some agreements, so I went to&#13;
Pakistan and said, "You know, the Bank is prepared to set this up. We're prepared to provide it.&#13;
We have other donors who are willing to join us the consortium." And I told them the story of&#13;
an old Jewish merchant, who every Saturday went to the synagogue and prayed that this coming&#13;
week, "Lord, please let me win the lottery. I want to win the lottery. God, please let me win the&#13;
lottery." And he never won the lottery. He was getting old. His wife was ailing. His kids had&#13;
left home. He was alone. His business was not booming. And he went to the synagogue and&#13;
said, "God, every week I've asked you. I've been here. I've been a good Jew. God, I've been&#13;
such a good Jew I've never even eaten a ham sandwich. What are we doing? I've asked and&#13;
asked and asked to win the lottery, and I've never won the lottery. God, ifI don't win the lottery&#13;
this week, you won't see me here again. I will have lost my faith." Suddenly the synagogue&#13;
clouds over, and a sonorous voice says, "Moise, Moise. Give me a break. Buy a ticket!" I said&#13;
to Zia-ul-Haq, "You know, on Kalabagh give me a break. Buy a ticket." He laughed and there&#13;
was a long pause.&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Look, my plane will be ready in half an hour. You go out to the airport. We'll get a&#13;
car to get you out to the airport. I want you to fly up to Peshawar and talk with the governor."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So I got on the plane, flew up to Peshawar and talked with the governor. The governor met me&#13;
at the airport. I said I was here. He said, "I know exactly why you're here. Let's go to the fort."&#13;
We went to the old British fort in Peshawar. And he said, "Mr. Hopper, I'll tell you there isn't&#13;
going to be a Kalabagh."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, why not? We need the water. You need the water. You need the power.&#13;
You need the irrigation systems that come from it. It's part ofthe Indus Treaty. It's part of the&#13;
things that were worked on that the Bank was a signatory to, the Indus Treaty in 1960."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Mr. Hopper, let me tell you. Do you know what happened at Tarbela?" Tarbela was&#13;
the other big dam, the second biggest--well, the biggest earth-filled dam in the world at the&#13;
present time, holding back the Indus River. He said, "You know, that's a big reservoir behind&#13;
that dam." And he said, "The people were never paid." There was a big rumor circulating that&#13;
the government wasn't going to pay them. The water was going to rise, they closed off the&#13;
coffer dams, the water was beginning to come up, the government hasn't made any&#13;
announcement to reimburse them for the land that would be flooded and so on. He said, "About&#13;
three months as the water was rising a group of people came in and said, 'Look, the government&#13;
is not doing anything, but we're willing--this is a charity--we're willing to buy the land. We&#13;
can't pay you very much, but we can pay you now for it. Just sign it over.' And they signed&#13;
over 85 percent of the land that would be affected by this flooding. The peasantry were moved&#13;
off the land. They had these small returns. One month before the major closing to raise the&#13;
water, the government announced a big, big payment for the land. It was done. Five families&#13;
had arranged to buy this land, including the family ofthe then President." He said, "The outcry&#13;
was immense." He said, "Mr. Hopper, until they say to the people at Kalabagh who will be&#13;
displaced by the reservoir that's there, until they offer them a very, very handsome sum for the&#13;
land they will lose, there will not be a Kalabagh." He said, "I tell you this because there will be a&#13;
revolt."&#13;
&#13;
So I went back to see Zia, and I said, "Well, this is what I was told."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "I know, I know. I've heard it. I've heard it. I've heard it. You don't need to tell me."&#13;
But he said, "Mr. Hopper, I will tell you that there is no way that I can arrange that kind of a&#13;
thing." He said, "The situation in Pakistan is such that I cannot do it." Kalabagh was never&#13;
built.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: It's interesting because ..&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Now, just a minute. I come back to the Bank. Do I go through this with the Bank?&#13;
I did with McNamara, but I mean he's gone now. This was in the days of [Alden W.] Clausen. I&#13;
don't go to talk with Clausen. I just simply tell my friends that, "Look, Kalabagh is out; we're&#13;
not in it."&#13;
&#13;
Now, this is a good deal of what I was doing as the Vice President for South Asia. We got an&#13;
awful lot done, including the Outfall Bank on the lower Indus River, a bunch of poya [phonetic]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                              April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   46&#13;
&#13;
lakes in which you took the salty material off and let it evaporate so that the salt was there but it&#13;
didn't affect the land that you had, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
I go through this merely to point out that I was an activist, and I didn't kind of do this. I got&#13;
along very well with McNamara. I got along well with Clausen, once he understood my role in&#13;
all of this. I didn't spend time writing notes for him, et cetera. I didn't need to. He was a bright&#13;
person, and it wasn't necessary. My colleagues, in traveling with him, were continuously&#13;
preparing this for him, preparing that for him, writing this, writing that, writing something else. I&#13;
didn't. I took him into Pakistan, I took him into India, I took him into Bangladesh, I took him&#13;
into various places. And I would arrange for him to go to places, took McNamara to this mud&#13;
village I lived in in India and trotted him around to meet people, et cetera. No, I did not. I was&#13;
not a: "This is what we ought to do: one, two, three, four, five six." It was: "How do you make&#13;
the adjustment over what we are doing and what we're talking about to the circumstances which&#13;
they face?"&#13;
&#13;
Now, this did lead to a series of things. On Bangladesh, for example, I was very, very concerned&#13;
about how they held a democratic union in Bangladesh. This was after they'd had two or three&#13;
military men. Ziaur Rahman, who was the guy in Bangladesh that took over after the slaughter&#13;
in '76, '75, I developed a very close relation with Ziaur Rahman as the military commander in&#13;
this. He was assassinated in 1980, and I was very, very upset by it. But one ofthe things he&#13;
wanted to do was to move this country slowly back to a democracy.&#13;
&#13;
Okay, I had people in the Bank who were saying, "Okay, now he's gone. Now let's, we'll get&#13;
the democratic elements running here. We're away," and the rest of it. I was very, very&#13;
concerned that we not--that we not move in and try to be the dictator with our money that says,&#13;
"This is what we do." 1 got into lots of trouble with Ernie [Ernest] Stem and a series of others.&#13;
who wanted things done this way. But I didn't have any difficulty in moving either McNamara&#13;
or Clausen that this is how we ought to do it. We do it slowly. We do it the way it goes.&#13;
&#13;
Bangladesh is a mess today, yes, but it's a democratic mess, in one sense. The military are not in&#13;
there. You have two women, Ziaur Rahman's widow and the daughter ofthe man who was the&#13;
sheik who took over after the separation of East Pakistan, which is now Bangladesh, from the&#13;
West Pakistan. He was killed and his family all shot down except that the daughter was out in&#13;
Britain. These two women are at each other's throats. Their parties change every election&#13;
period. It's not a balanced country. It's not the kind of place you'd like to see, but it has met its&#13;
food requirements. It has done a series of other things. And they remain being poets and so on&#13;
because Bangladeshis are nothing if not poets.&#13;
&#13;
All right, I don't know whether this explains ...&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Yeah, no, this is good, because it was kind of funny. I was just curious why there&#13;
weren't similar files for the two positions. And, you know, it was hard for me to find out what&#13;
your role was as, you know, the Vice President of South Asia, so maybe you could talk a little bit&#13;
more about how you saw--when you came in, what were the portfolios like and what did you see&#13;
as strategies?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         W. David Hopper&#13;
                               April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 47&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: I saw a very good portfolio group. I think that I altered some things that had been&#13;
there. I held quite a few more meetings. I dug into the--the Bank under McNamara had a&#13;
projects unit and a, basically, program policy unit. I found the program policy unit very, very&#13;
kind of much more, you know, "This is what we ought to do; this is how we ought to do it," and&#13;
so on and so forth, than I felt was relevant. I felt that they didn't really understand--and many&#13;
times many of them did; it would be wrong to say that this was--but they really were much more&#13;
kind of "This is how we function, this is what we do in this institution, and this is what we expect&#13;
from them," et cetera. This was kind of the program policy unit.&#13;
&#13;
The project group were, I found to be extraordinarily good. They had an irrigation guy who&#13;
really knew a hell of a lot about irrigation, an Israeli. They had a very, very good power group,&#13;
electric power group. They had a first-rate group dealing with education, roads, the&#13;
infrastructure, the railroad issues, and so on. And I found that they were blocked many times by&#13;
the program unit and by a separate unit that was outside of this, under Warren Baum, that kind of&#13;
reviewed everything and made sure that the numbers were there and that the rates of return were&#13;
adequate, and so on and so forth. And I used to tease McNamara in that, you know, ifhe wanted&#13;
a rate of return, I can give him a rate of return. So what? If they wanted ten percent, would you&#13;
like it eleven percent or twelve percent? I can do that, too. All it is is mucking around with&#13;
numbers. And I used to tease Bob on these things. You know, I'd get a telephone call from him&#13;
saying, "I just noticed this." I'd say, "Yes, yes, I know. We're doing our best."&#13;
&#13;
In Delhi, in the Delhi office and in the Pakistan office--because there was a Pakistan office at&#13;
that time--I opened up a Bangladesh office; I opened up a small office in Sri Lanka. The general&#13;
attitude is, "What Washington doesn't know won't hurt them. Now let's get on with the job."&#13;
And that's what we did. I became very close to [Junius Richard] Jayawardene in Sri Lanka. He&#13;
wasn't doing what the World Bank wanted him to do, so he and I had some conversations about&#13;
it. And the World Bank adjusted their position, he adjusted his, and we got along fine.&#13;
&#13;
In part, Kelly, it--there was a repetition ofthis. There was one more. There was a man from&#13;
Panama who became Vice President for Latin America, and he and I just worked exactly the&#13;
same way. You have to know what's going on in these countries. You can't go in from the&#13;
outside. You can't move in. And one of my problems since leaving the vice presidency for&#13;
South Asia was that Joe [D. Joseph] Wood took over. Joe I knew very, very well, but he was a&#13;
monetary specialist in the Bank, much more over in the Treasury, and he came in as Vice&#13;
President for South Asia. He didn't know South Asia. I mean, he didn't know how the Nepalese&#13;
think. He didn't know how they worked. He didn't know what it was. I'd traveled over Nepal&#13;
with the crown prince before he became King Birendra, and I was the first foreigner to be&#13;
received by Birendra after his father died, King Mahendra died. I was in Canada then. I was&#13;
with the IDRC in Canada.&#13;
&#13;
I take a look at the group now. I mean, if I can go down the vice presidents since then: a&#13;
Japanese girl who I hired and put into Bangladesh and who was suddenly made Vice President&#13;
for South Asia. She knew nothing about South Asia. The guy they have now, [Praful C.] Patel,&#13;
he come,s from an Indian family, but he comes from Uganda. It was one of the families booted&#13;
out by Idi Amin when he booted out the Indians. He was a Gujarati family. He went to Britain.&#13;
The British allowed--brought in Indians into Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania--or it became&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Tanganyika, but now Tanzania. They stayed, and these are the offspring. But Patel, if I have&#13;
any difficulty with him, it's not that he doesn't speak Gujarati; he does. But there is a feel that&#13;
you can only get when you really move around in these circumstances, and you've got to be alert&#13;
to it.&#13;
&#13;
I was asked some years ago after I left the Bank by Manmohan Singh, who is a very good friend&#13;
of mine--he was the Minister of Finance then--could I come in and do basically the same thing&#13;
that was done by Crawford, Sir 10hn Crawford from Australia, on agriculture that led to the&#13;
Green Revolution, which now seemed to be drifting. I said yes, I'd be delighted to do this, and I&#13;
had a supporter from here who was willing to pay for it, not the Bank. But I went to see the ag&#13;
minister, and it was quite clear in the conversation with the agriculture minister, who was a&#13;
Punjabi, that he didn't feel there was any necessity for an outsider to come in and take a look at&#13;
it. They could handle it. We talked about it. We visited--I visited some of his secretaries and so&#13;
on and so forth, and I came away with the feeling that the finance ministry may be concerned,&#13;
but clearly the ag ministry isn't, and that it isn't necessary. It just wasn't. They'll find a way out&#13;
of it. It won't necessarily be the way I'd recommend, but it's where it is.&#13;
&#13;
And I think, again, we're dictating now from the Bank. I mean, let's-you know, we're going to&#13;
do this, the millennial goals, and we're going to do that, and we're going to do something else,&#13;
and here we go. And this election which is just winding up is a clear mandate that--well, it isn't&#13;
so clear, the mandate. But the issue is that the B1P, who felt they were going to take this thing--&#13;
this is the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is a kind of a Hindu group, not a radical but a group of&#13;
kind of orthodox Hindus who decided it's going to be Hinduism that we've got and so on. They&#13;
have now a billion, 70 million people at last estimate. I was told the other day it's now a billion,&#13;
90 million, but plus or minus a couple million doesn't really make a difference, or 20 million.&#13;
The election has tossed out the B1P, and the Congress has come back in. It will be a hung&#13;
parliament. We'll see what occurs.&#13;
&#13;
Well, what was the swing? The swing was the fact that 70 percent of the people still live in rural&#13;
areas, and they have not built the roads. The position that many, many have taken is, you know,&#13;
this is an election on, to use a Hindi term, bijli, sarak,pani and so on. It's electricity, it's water,&#13;
it's roads, it's telecommunications, it's schools, it's health posts.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: It's infrastructure, and rural infrastructure. The gains in their economy, this eight&#13;
percent growth rate that they've had, have been to the call centers and to a whole series of things&#13;
in the IT games, the computer programming, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: It's really urban.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Which is strongly urban, very heavily kids who went to school and learned English.&#13;
South India it's among the Dravidians in south India, and what occurred with the Dravidians&#13;
when Nehru said he wants Hindi to be the only language in his constitution of 1954, the south&#13;
rebelled. The Dravidians in the south--a totally different ethnic group, speaking a different&#13;
language--they rebelled. They blew up railroads, trains. They said absolutely no and introduced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         W. David Hopper&#13;
                               April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  49&#13;
&#13;
English into kindergarten. They were not going to be hooked with Hindi, which is a Sanskritic&#13;
derivative. The Dravidians were in there when the Indo-Europeans crossed the Hindu Kush in&#13;
2000 BC or so, or BCE if I'm to be perfectly correct, Before the Common Era. They found a&#13;
civilization that was there and an advanced civilization--the Indus civilization, as the Pakistanis&#13;
like to call it. They went down a river called the Saraswati and so on, and everybody decided&#13;
that it was gone. It wasn't. It was filled in with the desert, the Rajasthan desert, and we now&#13;
know where it is by digging out old mounds and this sort of thing. But the Dravidians in the&#13;
south have held English. It is in Bangalore. It is in Plupanpur [phonetic]. It is in a whole series&#13;
of, Secunderabad outside of Hyderabad, and so on that you get this intellectual ferment.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the north is behind them in this thing. But the northerners are saying, "Why the hey are we&#13;
not down there?" The north adopted Hindi, and it was--taking Clausen to visit Uttar Pradesh, the&#13;
chief minister of Uttar Pradesh is an old friend, Rajah, proceeded to conduct the meeting in Hindi&#13;
with interpreters. Periodically I'd interrupt the interpreters and say, "I think what you really&#13;
wanted to say was this." [Laughter] The chief minister finally decided, "Okay, Hopper, let's&#13;
talk English."&#13;
&#13;
But it's this game that's going on, and it's this game that the election is there. And it's the rural&#13;
population, basically, that decided that the BJP slogan of "Shining India" or "India Shines"&#13;
affected only about a million people on the economy and there's this huge number of people&#13;
sitting out here in the rural areas that were not affected and who want to be. Water shortages are&#13;
now immense, drinking water shortages. The agricultural thing has been a very, very good year&#13;
last year because the rains were heavy and about 68 percent of your agriculture is related to rains.&#13;
We've got to get them. They want power, and they're desperately short of it, but where do we&#13;
get it from? The government has not been open to this kind ofthing. And bluntly, my dear, the&#13;
W orId Bank has not been open to it.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: To rural development?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Not open to rural development. They're not open to big dams. They don't like big&#13;
dams.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Well, they got burned on a couple of them.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: What do you mean they got burned on a couple of them?&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Well, I'm thinking of Narmada, particularly.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Well, okay, let's take Mir Narmada, all right? There was no burning there.&#13;
Narmada was a dam that should have been built. It was part of it--the whole damn river. It was&#13;
the one river that flows from the east to the west. It comes up through Madhya Pradesh, down&#13;
into Andhra Pradesh. It crosses Madhya Pradesh, comes into Gujarat, hitting a little bit&#13;
Maharashtra, comes into Gujarat, and goes down to the ocean. All right, they've got a site to put&#13;
this thing in, at the mountainous interior. We went along with Narmada. It was a sensible,&#13;
sensible dam. It would have provided irrigation for over half of Gujarat. We did the studies and&#13;
so on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                .50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What occurred? What occurred was that as they began to close--began to build the Narmada&#13;
dam, there was a bunch of environmentalists from outside here. And I started the first&#13;
environmental organization at the Bank, the first environmental department, when I was Senior&#13;
Vice President, okay?&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: I used to classify them as the greens, the genuine greens and the goofy greens. And&#13;
the goofy greens took root. They decided that, well, because this thing would proceed to flood&#13;
land below, behind the dam, that was occupied by tribals, then they would move in. Ninety-four&#13;
percent of the tribals said, yes, yes, they wanted to relocate up in the irrigated areas. That six&#13;
percent that wasn't, they brought here, they brought elsewhere. They had a couple of graduates&#13;
among them who spoke English, and they began raising hell about it.&#13;
&#13;
And [Barber B.] Conable kept saying, "Now, what about this? What about this? What about&#13;
this?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Barber, forget it. I mean, it's not going to elect anybody to Congress. That's what&#13;
you're concerned with. Let's proceed to move with it."&#13;
&#13;
As soon as I retired, he establishes the--oh, whatever it is, the investigative council or committee&#13;
or whatever this thing is.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: With Bradford Morse.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Yes. Brad Morse and my good friend from Canada--god, what's his name?-&#13;
anyway, who, back when I was in Canada in the 1970s, early '70s, the Canadians decided that&#13;
they would check the North Sea area up off the gulf of McKenzie River, which flows north up&#13;
from Alberta up to the north slope. You were getting oil, the U.S. was getting oil, from Alaska.&#13;
All right, you were just starting this. There was some searches done along the mouth ofthe&#13;
McKenzie and so on, and they found out that there was natural gas, about 13 trillion cubic feet&#13;
they estimate. So there was then a big, big outcry on the part of the environmentalists that if you&#13;
put that in, you're going to run into problems with the caribou and all the rest of it. We don't&#13;
need it. We don't need to tap that gas. Let's keep the caribou.&#13;
&#13;
So they appointed a one-man royal commission, which you do in Canada. You have difficulty&#13;
within the government and there's kind of some problems, you appoint a royal commission and&#13;
give it to them. The royal commissioner was an ex-supreme court justice from British Columbia.&#13;
Our supreme court justices don't--it's not a lifetime appointment; it's a ten-year kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: In 1971 I had lunch with one of Pierre Trudeau's main people in his office as Prime&#13;
Minister in Canada, and I said to him, "What about this guy? Supposing there had been 60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
trillion cubic feet of gas. Would you have appointed him as a royal--would that have made any&#13;
difference?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Oh, if it had been 60 trillion cubic feet, we never would have appointed him as the&#13;
royal commissioner."&#13;
&#13;
Okay, he's the guy who got appointed to go up on this thing on Narmada with what's-his-name.&#13;
You may have mentioned his name.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: Bradford Morse.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Bradford Morse. Brad Morse was then so old that he couldn't basically do very&#13;
much. He was in his eighties. So this guy took really the brunt of it. They wrote a report that&#13;
said, "Don't do it." Conable went with it, decided not to do it.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I had pressed Conable not to do this. "Let's go ahead. The government of India wants it.&#13;
Gujarat wants it. The land has already been allocated. The people who want it--the location was&#13;
established. People had been moved from this area down there up to settlements that the&#13;
government was paying for until the water was available." It would have been a huge addition to&#13;
Gujarat's agricultural development.&#13;
&#13;
I appeared before a group in Canada that were--the Parliament in Canada. I appeared here,&#13;
saying that this was a very good decision. They kept it back.&#13;
&#13;
Eventually, it was handled through the [inaudible] courts and the government ofIndia, and the&#13;
government of India and their supreme courts, et cetera, just take an awful long time to do&#13;
anything. Eventually they decided to build the dam. And Wolfensohn goes out and sees the dam&#13;
and said, "What a marvelous thing we're doing. It's a good thing," and so on and so forth. But&#13;
it was delayed by, what, fifteen years. It would have been a huge addition and will be. That's&#13;
one thing.&#13;
&#13;
Okay, we got hauled up on Arun IlIon the same basis. We wanted to build a road in. And 10&#13;
and behold, there's something in the ILO agreements, International Labor Organization, that you&#13;
should not upset the lifestyle of the people if you are--when your development activities.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: Isn't that the nature of development activities?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Precisely.&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAULT: It's social engineering.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: But the thing is that the road was to be built, we were all set to go with the road, and&#13;
then the--whatever it's called--the group that does this. I have a good friend who was the&#13;
chairman of it, a Canadian, who started the word "sustainable development," by the way, one of&#13;
the first to use it. He got involved, and they decided that this would upset the lifestyle of the&#13;
people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       W. David Hopper&#13;
                             April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Wolfensohn phoned the then prime minister of Nepal, said he wasn't going to do it.&#13;
&#13;
The prime minister had just been in a helicopter crash and said, "But why?"&#13;
&#13;
Wolfensohn said, "I'm asking my people to send you our press release." And so Arun III was&#13;
knocked out.&#13;
&#13;
This wasn't a dam. It was a glacial lake that was up there, and they'd just used it as run of the&#13;
stream, tap it in the river coming down. But they needed to get into the lake. To get into the&#13;
lake, you needed to build a road. And the people were absolutely incensed, because they&#13;
expected the road.&#13;
&#13;
Now, what do you do now in Nepal? You walk for two weeks, three weeks, one week, with 82&#13;
pounds on your back on a tumpline, down through the hills and so on and so forth and then walk&#13;
back with what you've got. "Wouldn't it be great to have a road? Then we don't need to walk.&#13;
We can move our grain down. We can bring our stuff back," the people argued.&#13;
&#13;
So Wolfensohn kind of gave in and said, "Okay, you can build a temporary road, one that works&#13;
not in the rainy season but in the dry season."&#13;
&#13;
That didn't answer it. It didn't answer it in terms of Arun III, and the power wasn't there.&#13;
&#13;
Okay, so big dams, the big dam commission was there. The big dam commission said, "No, no,&#13;
no. No more big dams." What does a developing country do if they need power? We say that&#13;
they can't produce it. We don't like the Kyoto Treaty ourselves, but we love it on them, so that&#13;
they're not going to befoul the atmosphere. The U.S. said, "No, no. We're not going to do&#13;
Kyoto. I mean, we're producing all kinds of CO2 in the Midwest. Let's not change that."&#13;
Canada says, "Okay, we'll go along with CO2,'' but not recognizing that the bulk of Canadian&#13;
power is generated with hydro-sites, so there isn't any C02. They had agreed to adopt a big, big&#13;
CO2 requirement at Kyoto which doesn't affect Canadian power or very little on Canadian&#13;
power.&#13;
&#13;
All right, right now I'm bang in the middle of what the hell do we do with big dams, so let's go&#13;
ahead. India is about 100,000 megawatts short of electric power. Where are they going to get it&#13;
from? Okay, they're talking about damming the Brahmaputra and bringing the water up over the&#13;
Vindhayas and down the hills and so on and so forth. Then you bring Ganga Jal, which is&#13;
something the BJP will like because it's the holy Hindu water, the Ganges water, down to the&#13;
Kaveri, the very lowest river in South India. This is a nutty idea. It's an idea that old M. S. Rao&#13;
had years and years and years ago-K.O. Rao, I'm sorry--had years and years and years ago and&#13;
which was stupid then and is stupid now. Bangladesh will complain bitterly because they want&#13;
the water coming down from the Brahmaputra (becomes the Jumna when it crosses the boundary&#13;
into Bangladesh), meaning Friday, which is the holy day among the Muslims. Okay, this is&#13;
where it goes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I sat in the middle of this, knowing a great deal about what was going on in different places&#13;
and parts of India. I didn't write notes about it. I brought people together, and we talked about&#13;
it, and that was that. They went off and did what they were, what we going to do. We came to&#13;
agreements.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Okay. I mean, when you started it was kind of the end of McNamara's term--he&#13;
had only three years left--it was also the winding down of his poverty reduction plans, because&#13;
when Clausen came in, those kind of were subdued, but so was rural agriculture and rural&#13;
development when Clausen arrived. So how did that affect your strategies and your policies for&#13;
South Asia at the time? I mean, you knew this was integral to these countries, so how did you&#13;
deal with this conflict of interest, shall we call it?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: I didn't. I didn't. Ijust ignored it. Look, you had to feed India, for god's sakes. I&#13;
went through the period of time when they were coming in. The India consortium that I was&#13;
chairing from '78 onward was a consortium in which we were discussing this. But in '74, as I&#13;
think I told you, I had Mrs. Gandhi tell me, "How do we do it?" I phoned McNamara, and&#13;
McNamara agreed. I followed with McNamara throughout this whole thing. That's why when&#13;
he finally said, "How can I get you here," it was to tell him that Vice President for South Asia is&#13;
the only thing I was interested in.&#13;
&#13;
But I got into the Vice President for South Asia, and, you know, Clausen--I liked Tom very&#13;
much, because the--I knew India. He knew I knew India. I took him down to Benares. I took&#13;
him to different places. I let him see what India really was like. From then on, I did what I had&#13;
to do, and there was never any real argument about it. I had more arguments with Stem than I .&#13;
did with his deputy than I had otherwise.&#13;
&#13;
Stem had learned that what Machiavelli had said is that, "Never take the barons on in full&#13;
number." In other words, you've got a bunch of barons here, and the barons are basically the&#13;
vice presidents for the regions. And if you took them on together, you lost; I mean, it's King&#13;
John and Runnymede all over again. Sign the Magna Carta. [inaudible] resign instead. So Stem&#13;
would wait and then jump on you individually. I mean, periodically I would get hell for what&#13;
was going on in Pakistan because Stem had been in Pakistan, and he knew what the heck it was&#13;
about. He had been Vice President for South Asia before I came in. I replaced him. He had&#13;
very, very strong views as to what they should do on population and what they should do on&#13;
other things and the rest of it, and they needed to get these things into effect.&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAUL T: What were his views?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: He felt that they needed to bring in systems of birth control, and that they needed to&#13;
do more things to try to improve the--Iower the birth rates in the country and the rest of it. And I&#13;
knew damn well that you weren't going to lower the birth rates in the country. You weren't&#13;
going to affect the birth rates in the country; I mean, what you are affecting is the death rates in&#13;
the country. The death rates are beginning to drop. Birth rates are determined culturally up here.&#13;
The graph is this way, if you want. Birth rates are up here, 40 per 1,000 or so. Death rates were&#13;
dropping, and we had a population explosion. Going out and telling a bunch of peasant women&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
or in villages, et cetera, that they ought to have fewer children wasn't going to get you anywhere.&#13;
Merely introducing condoms and so on and so forth--it's cheaper to buy cigarettes.&#13;
&#13;
So this was there. I just ignored it, you know. r d get hell for it, but so what. He'd jump on me.&#13;
He'd jump on us individually as barons, and we'd just ignore him and go back to your baronetcy&#13;
and say that's that. I was a baron.&#13;
&#13;
The later job, when I got kicked up to being Senior Vice President for Policy, Planning, and&#13;
Research, that was a courtier's job, and I hated it. I mean, I just wasn't pleasant with it at all.&#13;
Fortunately, it was Conable. He got trapped by several others, and I never knew what the hell I&#13;
was supposed to be doing anyway. [Laughter] Dealing with the goofy greens.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: That we have lots of information on, so I'll get to that in a little bit. Let's see.&#13;
You mentioned that you altered a few things when you started as Vice President for South Asia.&#13;
What were some of those things?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: I had less-I had a very, very good project group, and I kind of encouraged them to&#13;
go do what they had to do in their areas: Let's get this thing going. Let's get it out on the table.&#13;
Let's see where we are. Let's take a look at the irrigation in Gujarat, for example, and make sure&#13;
that we've got, we know what we're doing in terms of canal developments and the rest of it.&#13;
Let's try to improve the irrigation systems that we have. There were too many end-users that&#13;
weren't getting the water and too many were putting it out up here and so on. A whole set of&#13;
these things that these guys were very, very good at.&#13;
&#13;
Now, one of the criticisms I had with McNamara on the nighttime telephone calls was, "You&#13;
know, Bob, you phone me to find out about India. God damn it, I know the Bank people that&#13;
come here--Iet's take your irrigation team that was just in here. They came from South Africa&#13;
and before that they were in Brazil. The only reason you call me is because I happen to be&#13;
sitting here in India and you're concerned about India. You've got to alter this. They've got to&#13;
do it."&#13;
&#13;
And he did. His structural reorganization was to put the project groups and the program groups&#13;
into the different baronetcies, the different regional offices under the vice presidents, so that I&#13;
had a group of people who knew Pakistan, who knew India, who knew Bangladesh, who knew&#13;
Sri Lanka, et cetera, and we could get together and see what's going on. And there was no&#13;
hesitation on this. I had a very, very good technical group, and if they weren't good, I got rid of&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
The program group were a different group. The program group were kind of in there. And what&#13;
occurred in Sri Lanka is a very good example. I went out to Sri Lanka and found that the&#13;
program guy--this is after I had come in, and I had been in only a few months--the program guy&#13;
had gone out to tell the Sri Lankan government that they couldn't, they shouldn't undertake this&#13;
big power development, irrigation development, et cetera, along one of the major rivers that&#13;
comes out of the hills and goes north in Sri Lanka. It was a multi-, multi-billion dollar project,&#13;
and the Bank was very, you know, deeply concerned that Sri Lanka was not doing what they&#13;
should be doing and all the rest of it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    55&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I arrived there. I discovered that he had gone catatonic because he'd that I was coming in and&#13;
there was-so we sent him home. I sat down with Jayawardene to find out about this thing. I&#13;
organized a meeting with the others. I supported it fully. I did some travel up and down the&#13;
river to take a look at it and all the rest of it. And the net effect was that at the aid group meeting&#13;
I got other people to finance it and the World Bank was into it, but we were not into it with a&#13;
great deal of money, but we put in a fair amount of outside assistance to Sri Lanka on it.&#13;
&#13;
What it was, Kelly, was--listen, Jayawardene and I walked around his building. This is the new&#13;
prime minister who was elected in '77; he was a right-winger. And we had a meeting at 11&#13;
0' clock. I was there at 11 in the morning. He came in, sat down, said, "This is an interesting&#13;
building." It was built by the Dutch as the presidential palace, built by the Dutch. He said, "You&#13;
might like to walk with me just to take a look at it." What he wanted to find out was what did I&#13;
know about Sri Lanka. Did I know anything? Well, it turns out I knew a hell of a lot about Sri&#13;
Lanka. I'd been there. I had been up to Kandy, I had been up in the tea areas, I had been&#13;
elsewhere, as part of the Rockefeller mission and as part of IDRC. That eased it.&#13;
&#13;
Then we got down to what do we do about this. And I said, "Well, okay, it's a 9 to 10 billion&#13;
dollar project. You're going to have to get assistance." So I got the Canadian High&#13;
Commissioner, the equivalent of ambassador, to Sri Lanka--the High Commissioners come from&#13;
the Commonwealth countries, and Canada is a Commonwealth country, so it's a High&#13;
Commissioner--I got the Canadian High Commissioner to hold a meeting that afternoon with the&#13;
Brits and the others that were there, the Danes and the Germans and so on and so forth. And we&#13;
hammered out an agreement as to how this thing was going to be done, and how it was going to&#13;
be done with minimal cost to the Bank. And we'd carryon our normal project and financing to&#13;
Sri Lanka, about 400 million dollars a year. They would go forward in putting in the dams,&#13;
Victoria Dam and the rest of it on this river.&#13;
&#13;
It's that game that I spent time playing, but it's a game that you can only spend this way if you're&#13;
not a neophyte. And that's where I was. Whether it's with Clausen or whether it's Conable or&#13;
whether it was McNamara, it was kind of a, "Okay, you know what you're doing. You know&#13;
what you're dealing with." So that it was, "Well, let's do this. Let's do that. Let's do something&#13;
else." Ifit didn't fit, you know, what Washington didn't know wouldn't hurt them.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: And the program folks, I mean they mostly were supposed to be doing&#13;
implementation ofthe projects?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: The program folks--you had your group who were--there was a group, a program&#13;
group, who were taking a look at the macroeconomics of this; that sort of thing was going on.&#13;
But you had the others who were saying, "Okay, this is where the bids are coming in. This is&#13;
what we've got to do. This is how we've got to deal with the Treasury over here. It's how we&#13;
have to take a look at how the projects are going." You had a code for, you know, that you had&#13;
to report monthly on the nature of the project-I mean, item one, item two, item three. Three&#13;
level was a very bad level, one was going well, this sort of thing. You went through these, and&#13;
they kind of looked after them for you.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  FEL TAUL T: Well, now, Ernie Stem did come up throughout all of these files, even if it was&#13;
 just the loan files at the time, and then later on. So I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit&#13;
  about--I know he was originally hired under McNamara. Wasn't he Deputy Chief Economist at&#13;
. first?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: That's right. But came in, he was, he was--look, I first nmt~m:india. He&#13;
was the U.S. AID guy in India.                                   WBG ARCHIVES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 FELTAULT: Why was that?&#13;
                                                                            APR 02 2012&#13;
                                                                       Exception   J t ~-LtiIat~ '/:14.;(;'&#13;
HOPPER: Well, because he--Ernie is bright as hell, a very, very competent guy, Buchenwald&#13;
graduate, et cetera. He was Dutch. He survived the German concentration camps and so on and&#13;
so forth. He is a master at feeling which way the wind is blowing and then influencing the wind&#13;
to blow from another direction. He is a good economist, much more in the macroeconomics than&#13;
he is in the microeconomics, but the microeconomics is not bad either.&#13;
&#13;
Kelly, I don't know what you do if you don't take a look at the cultural issues that you're dealing&#13;
with. I mean, if you want to tear apart the Iraq situation now, whether it's in the prisons and so&#13;
on, the anthropologists have contributions to make if you can get them to make them. My&#13;
problem with the anthropologists as a graduate student at Cornell was that they were more&#13;
interested in the culture and where it came from than the culture and where it's going to. My two&#13;
years living in a mud village and traveling to other villages and other areas and the research&#13;
communities in India and so on convinced me more than anything else that I wasn't dealing with&#13;
a bunch of fools. And it wasn't a question of dictating it. It wasn't a question of sitting outside:&#13;
"I'm superior." It's a question of getting to understand what their concerns are and how do we&#13;
blend those with kind of a sense of what modernity is.&#13;
&#13;
Now, there are two or three areas that--it's very different. In talking with a farmer once in the&#13;
village about using fertilizer, he said, "Well, is it the right thing to do?" This is basically almost&#13;
a religious position.&#13;
&#13;
And I say, "Yes, I think it is. It's the right thing to do."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, I've got to know that it's the right thing to do."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "You know, you were discussing with me how can you raise yields in the last&#13;
conversation. Now I'm telling you that one of the ways you might do this."&#13;
&#13;
"Well, yes," he said, "you know, I'm an evil man." He said, "I'm interested in things like the&#13;
yields and that sort of thing, and I shouldn't be. I should be concerned about it being the right&#13;
thing to do," the religious right thing to do. I add the religiousness. "But," he said, "you know,&#13;
I'm imperfect, so it's wise to tell me that fertilizer is good, too."&#13;
&#13;
And it's this game that you're constantly in. You can't move in a way that kind of says that,&#13;
"Okay, I'm superior; you're inferior."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          W. David Hopper&#13;
                                April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
If I had to put the label onto Stem, it would be that his view was, "This is what they ought to&#13;
do." My view was, "It would be nice if we could get them to move in those directions." In&#13;
agriculture, it's relatively easy. There's a market, there's factors, and so on. Okay, there isn't&#13;
that much roads in and they haven't got this and they haven't got that and a bunch of other&#13;
things. They built a road in for McNamara to visit my mud village; today it's known as the&#13;
McNamara Road. It was four miles from the nearest other road. It went across fields.&#13;
Somebody gave up their land to put this road in and to maintain it. Okay, land is expensive, and&#13;
land is what they go by. So was this the right thing to do? I don't know. The government did it.&#13;
I didn't. I told Bob we'd walk in; well, that would have been fine with him.&#13;
&#13;
Tum to health. That's a totally different one because in health you've got a wide range of beliefs&#13;
that are not easily shed. It took us what, as I think I told you last time, 400 years to agree that&#13;
bacteria, the wee beasties that we saw under the microscope in the 14th century, it was to the 19th&#13;
century before we decided that they were really sources of disease and even then the medical&#13;
profession took another 50 years to believe it. It took us another 50 years to do viruses, and it's&#13;
taking us more than 50 years to agree on prions, the sources of mad cow disease or variant&#13;
Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease. We've started a whole new scientific structure in prion protonomics&#13;
as to proteins, because it turns out our genome didn'thave nearly as many genes as we thought it&#13;
would have to have to produce 100,000 different proteins that make up the human body. There's&#13;
only 30,000 genes. So suddenly we discover that these proteins--the genes must be generating&#13;
something else that in tum generates the proteins. And here we are.&#13;
&#13;
I was talking with a farmer one day. He was out building a well--I think I told you this in the&#13;
previous one--and put it down, you know--they believe that malaria, et cetera, is caused by&#13;
bhoot. These are old women who walk the paths in translucent clothes at night. Their feet tum&#13;
backwards. And if you meet one on a path, you'd better jump off the path and get out the hell of&#13;
the field, because she'll latch onto you, and then you carry her home, and this brings in the&#13;
malaria or brings in other problems that you have as your source of disease, and therefore you've&#13;
got to bring in some kind of Brahmin from outside or somebody else who's got mystical powers&#13;
to get rid of the bhoot.&#13;
&#13;
And I told him, "Okay, put this cement wall down so that the first aquifer doesn't come into your&#13;
drinking water well. You take the second aquifer, the third aquifer, and bring that water in&#13;
because it's been filtered down through the soil and so on."&#13;
&#13;
He looks at me and says, "Hopper, you believe in the germ theory of disease?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, yes, I do."&#13;
&#13;
"Have you ever seen a germ?"&#13;
&#13;
"Well, no, I haven't."&#13;
&#13;
"Aha!" he said. "I've seen a bhoot."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   58&#13;
&#13;
How do you get around this? The cultural barriers to change are far less on the agricultural side&#13;
than they are on the health side. Now, it doesn't mean that there aren't differences; there are.&#13;
One of the things that you have as an item in India is that you save--it's to serve to a guest or to a&#13;
marriage party or to whatever else--a grain that you harvested last year, not this year. It's a great&#13;
thing, because that meant you had enough grain to last through the family and for your--who are&#13;
known as the jajmans or the--I'm sorry, the purjans around you, the native workers that you&#13;
have, the low caste workers that you're responsible for. Okay, our farmers wouldn't think about&#13;
saving last year's grain: get the damn stuff out and get it to market and so on and so forth. Ifwe&#13;
run into problems, go to the bank the next year. But this is all part of it.&#13;
&#13;
But when it comes to health, boy, it's a very, very different picture. My first wife was a nurse.&#13;
She worked in this village as a nurse. She got it so that I was known as Dr. Sabb's [phonetic]&#13;
husband. She was a doctor. People would bring somebody down with a cut. She'd put some&#13;
sulfa on it or something else, put a bandage on it, and that was that. They'd bring the child back&#13;
or the person would come back in a couple of weeks and say, "Look at it. It's a lovely, lovely,Â·&#13;
beautiful cut. It hasn't gone white. It hasn't gone pus-y." She said, "It shouldn't go pus-yo You&#13;
come here and it won't go pus-y." But to them, the pus was getting out the evil that was coming&#13;
into the body. Okay, this whole thing is kind of a game.&#13;
&#13;
We had a kerosene heater, stove, that we used to use just to heat up things and boil them and so&#13;
on and so forth. The local vayd, the local person, medical man, would come in and put his&#13;
syringes into this little thing and heat it up and count to twenty minutes that was necessary, and&#13;
then he carefully lifted it out with tools and put it together. He'd say, "Okay, this is fine." Now&#13;
he's got himself a thing done. Then he'd run his thumb up the needle to take the water off.&#13;
Okay, there it is. And the health game is still there, and it's a very different game. It's one in&#13;
which the cultural elements, the belief structures, are just different.&#13;
&#13;
Agriculture was easy. Now, the thing that they want in agriculture now is power, is telephone, is&#13;
health posts because they do see health, is schools in the rural areas and the rest of it. And it's&#13;
not something that the present government is meeting, but it's not something that the World&#13;
Bank hasn't been meeting either. Wolfensohn, this is like--just Wolfensohn. How much time&#13;
has Wolfensohn ever spent in a developing country? Zilch.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Wasn't that characteristic of Clausen and Conable, too?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Well, I mean, Clausen went and very quickly would decide whether or not he could&#13;
rely on you to guide him, and I think he found that he could rely on me. There was never any&#13;
differences between us, none whatsoever. And Ijust built--I mean, I moved the thing from&#13;
something like a billion or a billion and a half dollars a year up to 4 billion dollars a year with&#13;
projects, and there was never any complaint. We visited different places. I took him up to&#13;
Peshawar. I took him down to Benares. I went to different places with him, he and his wife, to&#13;
Lucknowand so on. And it was clear: I was kind of home and what I said we needed to do on&#13;
the Ganges River was to begin to clean it up and so on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
With Conable, I didn't have any problems at all except that he booted me out of being a baron&#13;
and moved me into being a--because he wanted to consolidate both South Asia and East Asia,&#13;
China and so on, and make it one. It was a dumb idea.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Yes. Those are actually two very different regions.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: He did the same thing on Africa. He took East and West Africa and made it one.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: And there's sub-Saharan and northern Africa [inaudible] completely different.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Yes. Well, the North Africa one he stuck with, but we had divided because of the&#13;
French angle on the western side. South Africa was still a pariah at the time.&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAULT: What you are really talking about is taking sort of those individual cultural&#13;
relations and that knowledge and turning it into policy. And I know that's always difficult. Part&#13;
ofthe other issue was the World Bank didn't have a lot of cultural social scientists working with&#13;
them. They had a lot of economists but not a lot of ...&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Yes. But we had far more--I mean, the proportion of staff was economists were&#13;
fewer at that time, in the '80s, late '70s and '80s. McNamara had brought in a lot of technical&#13;
people, so we had a good technical staff. And the economists were over in the Treasury and&#13;
working with others there, but the economists were not--I had a very good chief economist, two&#13;
ofthem, one after the other. The second was exceedingly good.&#13;
&#13;
And I moved some computers at that time--they weren't called computers then. I couldn't buy&#13;
computers myself, that was [inaudible] the limits ofthe Bank, but I could buy calculators. So we&#13;
moved what were early computers in as calculators into Delhi, and our, the economists in Delhi&#13;
worked directly with the Indians and so on, did the same thing in Pakistan and in Bangladesh and&#13;
got things going very well in these countries. That was for the aid groups and this sort of thing,&#13;
to see what was going on.&#13;
&#13;
The program people were very good once they understood that this is what had to be done, and it&#13;
was a question, then, of making up, you know, the call for project investments and this kind of&#13;
thing and working with the purchasing group and the different ones in the Bank that handled&#13;
bids, project bids and so on, and who were in India who were engaged in this sort ofthing. And&#13;
I was, again, back to the reserve bank, back to the various Indian banking groups that were&#13;
involved in it, the ICICI [Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation ofIndia], the Indian&#13;
center for investment activity. I knew what was going on in those places. I had good friends at&#13;
the reserve bank that would warn me about what was occurring here. And the Indian reserve&#13;
bank handled Bhutan's money and so on. There were problems with Nepal. Nepal had its own&#13;
reserve bank, but I could go in there and talk with them. It was just a kind of--sure, I went out,&#13;
you know, three or four times a year for one, two, three weeks to see what was going on and&#13;
talking with people who were part of it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                             April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  60&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: One thing I did notice is that after you started with the South Asia region,&#13;
suddenly there were a lot more research reports being done and issued. I'm wondering was that&#13;
a policy shift on your part or when you started, was there a lack of research that had been done?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: No, there wasn't a lack of it. We had to make justifications. When Stern ran South&#13;
Asia, and before him, when--another name. AAMI; I'll think of it--anyway, a Brit who was in&#13;
there looking after the South Asia desk, it was before McNamara created South Asia, or it was&#13;
the early stages ofthis, he'd spent many years there with the British in Asia. He knew it well.&#13;
He didn't trust research reports or want them. Stern would more or less say, "What's going on?&#13;
What were really here?" and so on and the rest of it.&#13;
&#13;
I was more concerned with making sure that we knew what the hell we were talking about, and&#13;
that meant getting some people to report on irrigation, on power, on transport, on rail lines, on a&#13;
whole array of things, private investments and that kind of thing. And I didn't want them too&#13;
long; they shouldn't have been. But it was the ones who made visits and came back and said,&#13;
"Okay, this is what we think ought to be done," those were the ones that I would hold a meeting&#13;
on and go through and check and that sort of thing.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: Was this something that the other vice presidents for the regions were doing as&#13;
well?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Not generally. I think that what you have to recognize is that, with the exception of&#13;
the Latin American vice president, the others were all strangers to their areas. McNamara tried&#13;
to bring in people who had been--had some knowledge of what was there. But the knowledge&#13;
was not--look, how did I first meet Bob McNamara? Okay, I knew nothing about him except the&#13;
Vietnam War. I had been a couple oftimes to Vietnam during the war and this sort of thing,&#13;
looking at agriculture and so on. But I was a Canadian, so I was not deeply involved, although&#13;
there were Canadian troops there.&#13;
&#13;
The issues which I brought was that both the Canadian High Commissioner and the American&#13;
ambassador, if they had high-level people who came out, would try to get me to give them some&#13;
kind of run-down on what India was about. And I would give a lecture ranging from half an&#13;
hour to two hours with maps on the history, geography, geology, et cetera, ofIndia, right up&#13;
through partition and so on. And I was asked to do this for McNamara and did so, and that&#13;
opened up a set of conversations. He wanted to know more about the Green Revolution or the&#13;
new crops that were coming in because he had heard about them from Rockefeller Foundation&#13;
and so on, and I was working with Rockefeller then when he came in, and we talked about this.&#13;
I had taken others out to Indian Agricultural Research Institute where I was a visiting professor&#13;
to visit some of these plots and this sort of thing, and there was a battle going on in India as to&#13;
whether they should get fertilizer or manufacture fertilizer in India. Was this the kind of thing&#13;
you wanted? And there was a great deal of discussion, and I was in the middle of all of this and I&#13;
was writing reports out there on it.&#13;
&#13;
Okay, what McNamara saw in this thing was somebody who knew something about India, and&#13;
what he hears from others was that, yeah, I was doing a good job and so on. We went on from&#13;
there. I didn't come down on the first offer because I was at IDRC and I had just taken over. I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             61&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
took over in 1970 in Canada, and I was not prepared to move, had a good organization that was&#13;
moving, and so on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
The reason you're in this house is that 1976 I was down here with Ruth, and we had dinner with&#13;
McNamara and a group. McNamara asked me to stay on. He said had we been looking. Ruth&#13;
said, yes, we had been looking. We were looking at an apartment over here. He said, "Don't&#13;
buy it. Don't buy it. It's a cooperative. Don't buy it. Buy a house. Buy a house." So we saw&#13;
this place. This was a year before--almost two years before he offered me a job, the job I&#13;
wanted-or about a year and a half. So this is where we moved to when we came down.&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAULT: So you bought this about two years before you moved down here?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: We bought it in '76, the tail end of '76, and I came down in January of '78.&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAULT: And other than the fact that it was South Asia which you were offered, I mean&#13;
what were the other reasons for leaving IDRC in Canada?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: I had been there seven years, and I really felt that seven years was long enough. It&#13;
was built. It had built a reputation. The Parliament was happy, and they were getting increased&#13;
budgets, and so on and so forth. But the issue was--I had an old friend, Frosty Hill, who I&#13;
mentioned to you on the previous one. Frosty said, "Always go where the money is." There was&#13;
more money at the Bank. [Laughter] Not as payment. The reimbursement was basically the&#13;
same. But you were dealing with billions here, and I was dealing with a few hundred million--or&#13;
a few millions. It was tens of millions. It was 30 million, I think, was my annual budget or&#13;
something or my final annual budget.&#13;
&#13;
FELT AULT: So you could really-I mean, could you see yourself doing more, having more&#13;
impact at the Bank than at IDRC?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Sure, sure, sure. At IDRC I was welcome and it was very nice to see me and so on&#13;
and so forth, but I was not dangling potential funds of any kind. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Well, more sort of the context of the '70s when you came into the Bank and the&#13;
climate of the environmental movement, which we sort of mentioned, the women's movement,&#13;
the start of the indigenous movement, so all of these movements that ended up having a great&#13;
impact on development and its changing paradigms in the '80s and '90s.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: The environmental movement--I didn't have any problem with, quote, "genuine"&#13;
greens. I was very much for them. And I was very much, in a real sense, for the greens. Now,&#13;
the genuine greens are the ones that I said balance off the realities of human existence and an&#13;
expanding population, and how do you feed them, how do you handle them, how do you provide&#13;
jobs for them, where do they move from here, because that's what we were confronting. I went&#13;
to India--275 million in the mid-'50s. There was 400 million when I went back in '62. There&#13;
was 470 million when I began to move out of it. Today there's a billion, 70 million or 90&#13;
million.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  62&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: .. and to find a group of people who were saying, "No, no, you can't do this. You&#13;
can't, you know, build dams. We shouldn't do this. You're upsetting the balance of human&#13;
existence or whatever else. Is this something that we should be doing, the Nannada Dam being a&#13;
case in point? Should we irrigate up here? Should we protect the fish that are coming in on the&#13;
lower area? The water was going to be behind the dam and you're going to see trees being&#13;
destroyed down in this area," et cetera. Those are all questions that did have to be debated. I&#13;
don't mind the debate, but let's ..&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: .. those are all debates. There is no--to me, the issue is the balance in here. The&#13;
Rene Dubos group, where the late Rene Dubos at Rockefeller University in New York really&#13;
spent a great deal of time trying to balance off the human requirements with the environment,&#13;
whether it's trees or animals or whatever else, and how do you strike the balance between these?&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: I'm not quite certain where we were.&#13;
&#13;
FEL T AUL T: Balancing human and environmental requirements.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Yes. The human environment with the others. I found that in dealing with the&#13;
genuine greens there is a balance that you can strike and it's very, very good to hit, but it's not a&#13;
balance that many others are prepared to do. And one of my favorite stories is that I began to get&#13;
petitions in, tens ofthousands of signatures on them, from groups that wanted to do in furs. "We&#13;
shouldn't have furs, fur coats and so on. This is destroying animals."&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAULT: What does the Bank have to do with it?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: But this was part of the environment. But equally, another balanced group that were&#13;
very, very concerned that--the fur bunch were negative in terms of killing seals, which happens&#13;
to be the major income source to Eskimos or Inuit, as they like to call themselves. "Eskimo" is a&#13;
word meaning "raw meat eater" that the Crees said about the northern people. The word "Inuit"&#13;
means "the people." They would go out and kill seals, and this killing seals had to stop, and the&#13;
World Bank had to be involved, and no more of this and so on.&#13;
&#13;
Now, you put this on at a time when--you put this on at a time when the Pope made a visit to the&#13;
United States, then went up to Canada, and he was asked--went up right up to the north into the&#13;
Inuit country. They had put on fur vestments for him to do his holy words and so on and so&#13;
forth, and there were groups of people there who took pictures of the Pope in fur vestments. And&#13;
there was a great outcry on the part of, one, a group who says, you know, "Keep the furs. Don't&#13;
worry about the seals. They eat cod anyway, and we need the cod. So keep that going. The&#13;
World Bank should be strong supporters of this kind of activity." And then you've got the other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     63&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
group saying, you know, "This was a gross mistake. The Pope was embarrassed. They gave him&#13;
furs to put on, and he put on, and there shouldn't be any more furs, and we should knock this&#13;
out."&#13;
&#13;
This is an example of two that came into the office, not simultaneously. And I had this from&#13;
people who were concerned with C02 and the global warming, and I had it from people who&#13;
were concerned about SOx and NOx, nitrous oxides and the sulfur oxides that are coming from&#13;
power plants, and we should be into just wind and solar. We certainly shouldn't build any more&#13;
dams because they affect the fish that are dO\vnstream from the dams and the salmon are not&#13;
really looked after properly that are going upriver in these areas, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.&#13;
This was just a big maze, and not one in which my particular view is, "Yes, yes, we do our best&#13;
is to preserve as much of our culture as we have, but we have to recognize that"--at that time&#13;
there was about five billion people, today there's six-"but there are five billion people in the&#13;
world that have got to be fed and got to be housed and got to be looked after because they're part&#13;
ofthe human race."&#13;
&#13;
Well, that's, you know, almost back to the position that the Nazis took that you had to be a&#13;
proper Aryan and full mentally alert, et cetera, otherwise cut their throats, at least castrate them&#13;
so that they're not reproducing. And this is where we go.&#13;
&#13;
Well, it was this balance. I didn't enjoy it I didn't like it, but there it was, and I engaged in it. I&#13;
met with environmental groups in a great many places to talk about this. Okay, that was one side&#13;
of it&#13;
&#13;
And I never did and I still don't feel comfortable with this balance. I see countries that&#13;
desperately need power, and the whole purpose of the Kyoto Treaty and what [Albert A., Jr.]&#13;
Gore did in the Kyoto was to say, "Okay, we will cut our CO2 emissions in terms of global&#13;
warming. The developing countries should be given some time to do it"&#13;
&#13;
The Malaysian group that were in this who were jumped on by several groups for not looking&#13;
after their tropical rainforest, Malaysia said, "Well, yes, yes, we're quite willing to look after&#13;
tropical rainforests, but recognize that 75 percent ofwhat"--or sorry-"95 percent of what we&#13;
cut is sold to the industrial countries, 55 percent to Japan. We're a poor country; we need&#13;
money. We're willing to stop it if you pay for it"&#13;
&#13;
And we're in exactly the same position with regard to a lot of other things, whether it's drugs&#13;
from Colombia or wherever else. "You stop it. We're willing to give you money for the&#13;
military, and we're willing to give you help, and we're willing to send down people, but you stop&#13;
the drugs." We're the demanders, yes, but, you know, we can't jump on our own people,&#13;
obviously.&#13;
&#13;
It's this game that the Bank got trapped between, and it's this game that I think the Bank is&#13;
trapped now on much of this, quote, "globalization" and many of the millennial goals.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: It's also similar to a lot of criticism on the Green Revolution as well, particularly&#13;
on the shrimp farming [inaudible] mangrove.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Yes. Swamps. That's right.&#13;
&#13;
FEL TA UL T: But the demand for shrimp in the West ..&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Is colossal.&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAUL T: It's colossal.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: And we have over-fished the cod. They're opening up the cod fishing in the Gulf of&#13;
St. Lawrence, both north and south, a little bit this year. But we'll see what happens. The seals&#13;
did eat an awful lot of cod. Then you've got poachers from Spain and Portugal coming in and&#13;
taking more. We're--okay, the salmon fish--this is the Atlantic salmon now, which turns out not&#13;
to be a salmon by the same elements as a Pacific salmon; it's a different family group. The&#13;
Atlantic salmon is really a red trout that happens to go to sea. But the salmon fish farms are now&#13;
being examined, and the environmentalists are after them as well. And in a sense, they should be&#13;
because there is a lot of chemical problems that they have and there's a lot of other things&#13;
[inaudible].&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Most of that is management because I have read a couple of articles and seen&#13;
some reports where there's one company and then also China itself has all this fish farming,&#13;
agricultural [inaudible].&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: The China fish farming--there was an article in Wired not too long ago on this. The&#13;
China fish farming is very, very, very much on land.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Right. Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: It's in rice paddies and elsewhere. They grow three or four species, one bottom&#13;
feeder and up to the top.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: So it stays clean.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Supposedly.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Supposedly [inaudible] What made you uncomfortable with trying to deal with&#13;
this balance and deal with the various environmental groups and their demands? And was there&#13;
a protocol at the Bank for having to answer these kinds of requests, because ..&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: No. Under Conable--Conable put this in with, in part because of his experience in&#13;
Congress where a great many Congressional people were opposing the Bank or angry with the&#13;
Bank because of what they were, the Bank was doing that affected, quote, "the environment,"&#13;
unquote.&#13;
&#13;
When I asked Barber one time--it was a particular guy from Wisconsin--"What's he talking&#13;
about? There's all kinds of problems in Wisconsin."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       W. David Hopper&#13;
                             April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He said, 'That's exactly what he's talking about, is that he doesn't want to do it in Wisconsin,&#13;
but he wants to be able to tell the people of Wisconsin, 'Yes, yes, yes, I've been very&#13;
instrumental in getting the Bank not to do this in Brazil or Argentina. Therefore, I am really&#13;
working with the environmentalists. ,,,&#13;
&#13;
We were deeply concerned about Brazil's forests. Maggie [Margaret H.] Thatcher went down&#13;
from Britain, talked with the Brazilian president about the forests. He said, "Yes, madam." He&#13;
understood this.&#13;
&#13;
She said, "Well, it's a great global resource."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Madam, let me just simply say, 'It's a Brazilian resource.'''&#13;
&#13;
And she said, "Yes, yes, I know, but you know the globe really depends on it."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Madam, Brazil depends on it." [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
Shortly thereafter, I was in Britain, and the head of the environment group was there, and we&#13;
were talking with him. He's now in the ED [European D nion], former governor in Hong Kong,&#13;
he was there when Hong Kong was moved over to the Chinese. And he said, "What does he do?&#13;
I've got Maggie--a half an hour with her, and I don't really know what to talk to her."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "But she was a chemist, so I would suggest you write some stuff out in chemistry. Start&#13;
with the ozone layer over the Antarctic and opening that up. Do some work on chemistry."&#13;
&#13;
My God, it lasted an hour and a half, and she became an environmentalist at the end of it because&#13;
she'd never really looked at all of this in terms of the chemical relationships and the maintenance&#13;
of ozone and the rest of it. So it's--that was one.&#13;
&#13;
But there were a whole series of other policy questions that had to be resolved. What Barber&#13;
wanted to do when he created the Policy Planning and Research was to get some strategic&#13;
planning done. Well, strategic planning--I brought in Francisco Sagasti from Peru, who was an&#13;
old friend and very good at it. And he wanted Francisco to do the strategic planning, and I had&#13;
told Barber that if you're going to do strategic planning, this is not something you share widely.&#13;
You share it with the head of the institution, and you can agree on strategies, but, well, Barber&#13;
insisted that it go to the full kind of upper echelon of the Bank. And Sagasti presented it, and&#13;
among the things Sagasti said was that the Russians are going to be into the Bank. They're&#13;
going to be tearing down the wall and so on and so forth, and they're going to be there. And&#13;
Stem just hit the roof. I mean, he: "Don't do any of that. Don't say it to anybody because all I&#13;
have to do to lose my IDA grants or IDA things from the Congress is to say, 'Russia is going to&#13;
be part ofthis institution.' Ignore it."&#13;
&#13;
What Sagasti was saying is that when the Russians come in, it's going to be a very different kind&#13;
of Bank because their whole structure of how they contract with things and so on and so forth is&#13;
not to put it out saying, you know, "Bring it in and you design it." The Russians designed it, and&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 66&#13;
&#13;
you put the thing out, and that's how you--it was just going to be--we're going to have a real&#13;
problem in getting through to a bureaucracy that handles everything from health through to&#13;
agriculture to farming to power plants to you name it. It's going to be a different Bank, and&#13;
we're going to have now to prepare for this kind ofthing in terms of the dialogue we have and&#13;
where we go to. And it was just, "No, absolutely, we're not to mention Russia, we're not to do&#13;
anything about Russia," and so on.&#13;
&#13;
Sagasti was, just laughed. I mean, he continued this way and did it. The Russians did tear it&#13;
down. The Russians--he predicted Russia in '92. The Russians came in--or '92, '94--and the&#13;
Russians came in in '90. The Berlin Wall came down in '89. It was starting in '91, '92. It did&#13;
change things very mightily.&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAULT: Let me ask how.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Because, first of all, you had the split up of the Russian group, so that we now had to&#13;
work with Romania, Bulgaria. Yugoslavia went to hell after [Josip Broz] Tito and was now into&#13;
various pieces and parts. And Tito had warned his followers not to put [Slobodan] Milosevic in&#13;
charge when he died because he's nothing but an ethnic Serb, and that's exactly what occurred&#13;
and still is occurring in Yugoslavia.&#13;
&#13;
When it came to Romania, the issue was how do we get into a discussion and dialogue. The&#13;
Russians had put in a big power plant in Romania, which was under very difficult conditions.&#13;
We found that nobody was willing to bid on going in to work on this power plant because the&#13;
way that the power plant was designed, it was the Russians who said, "This is what you will&#13;
have, the tubing you will have. This is where the generators are going to be, et cetera, et cetera,&#13;
et cetera. They're all going to be in these sizes." Well, these sizes, nobody was producing in the&#13;
West. They would have done it differently, but then how do you get in? The Romanians still&#13;
are: "Well, this is what we need. This is what we have." And suddenly the costs go up through&#13;
the roof.&#13;
&#13;
The entire discussion of how you handle these things, what you do, you send in a team, you work&#13;
with given contractors, with the private sectors and so on, and saying, "This is where we have to&#13;
go and what we need to do. Here is the private sector. This is what we put out to bid." In this&#13;
thing, you look to say, "Well, okay, this is what the private sector has to do, or the bidders have&#13;
to do, da-de-da-de-da-de-da-de." And they say, "Well, yes, but that's not our thing. We don't&#13;
have those metals. We don't have these kinds of things." And this is part of this dialogue.&#13;
&#13;
So it's easier to shift then to, "Okay, what do we do on structural adjustment, put things into the&#13;
box?" And the problem with structural adjustment is we have no way of controlling it. Money&#13;
is fungible. Structural adjustment, they can come back and say, "This is what we did--education&#13;
and roads and so on and so forth." But at the same time, we're driving Mercedes Benzes and&#13;
helping our bunch coming out. And I have been critical of structural adjustment right from the&#13;
beginning when it came in after the Belgrade conference in 1980. And Stern was very, very&#13;
strong for it.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 67&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What's occurred is that the Bank has now shifted to economists and MBAs. The MBA is now&#13;
kind of the method by which you get in. And we've lost--and I warned in the '80s that we were&#13;
going to lose our technical personnel. They were brought in by McNamara, the tail end of his,&#13;
early in his' reign. They came in at their forties; it's now twenty years later; they're up to&#13;
retirement age, and they're going to disappear. That's fine. Ernie had no problem. He just&#13;
thought they were a pain in the neck, these guys who knew it. We need economists in here, so&#13;
let's have economists. When Wolfensohn came in, let's have MBAs. This is what you've got.&#13;
And you just cut your engineering competencies to virtually nil. And I just find that--would find&#13;
that an extremely difficult institution to work in.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: I had a couple of friends who just left the Bank and said the same thing. It's&#13;
difficult.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: It's very difficult. I got working on power issues with the IFC [International&#13;
Finance Corporation] and on the possibility of putting in photovoltaic farms because one of the&#13;
problems in a developing country is that we built dams--they built dams back in the days and so&#13;
on and so forth--but most developing countries and tropical regions have periods of rainfall and&#13;
then periods of no rain. So you fill up behind this reservoir with your water, and this is enough&#13;
to drive the turbines to produce your power for Bangkok or the city or whatever else through the&#13;
dry season. Then you get your rains in and you begin again, except that the demand for power is&#13;
going up. People are putting air-conditioning in, they never did before. People are doing a wide&#13;
range of other things, and power demands are immense.&#13;
&#13;
So what do you do? Do you increase the size of the dam? Do you put another dam in? In many&#13;
cases, you can't. The reservoir is there and the rest of it. So let's put in photovoltaic farms. You&#13;
say, "Well, okay, let's put in wind farms." The problem with wind farms is you can't rely on the&#13;
winds. Like sitting out there today, you can have as much windmills as you want; you're not&#13;
going to keep the lights going or the air-conditioning going, because the windmills aren't&#13;
turning.&#13;
&#13;
You have this situation you had in California where the Californians decided they wanted to put&#13;
more wind farms in and found the Sierra Nevada mountains, the western end side of the Sierra--&#13;
east side of the mountains--got a wind sweep off the Pacific that came in, and they would spin&#13;
the windmills up there very, very well. This was great. The Sierra Club had backed: "Let's&#13;
have more wind farms and so on." Then they discovered that they were going to be on the Sierra&#13;
Nevada hills, and the Sierra Club just hit the roof. "No, no, no. We can't put them up there.&#13;
That's scenic. All you're going to do is destroy the view." They put a referendum out.&#13;
Everybody turned it down. So there you are.&#13;
&#13;
So we put in these solar voltaic farms. You can put them anywhere you want--up in the hills or&#13;
anything else, but that feeds in. So you've got twelve hours of--because in the tropics it's twelve&#13;
hours of darkness, twelve hours of sunshine. You've got twelve hours of sunshine, producing'&#13;
wattages that you then feed into the cities, and you close off your turbines in the hydro dams and&#13;
rely on a good chunk of this for the daytime and the other things. You may put a little through&#13;
one or two turbines just to keep the thing going, but that's where it is. And it darkens down, so&#13;
you open up more turbines and get the evening power going into the city, and it balances off.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And you store--because one of the problems with solar voltaics is where the heck do you store&#13;
the power? I mean, do we put big, big lead acid batteries out here by the tens of thousands and&#13;
feed them into this? How do you store it? Okay, you store it behind the reservoir. We've got it&#13;
built. You just don't pump as much water.&#13;
&#13;
Okay, this is something we did. The environmentalists hit the roof. There was a whole series of&#13;
things. We got going in the IFC on it, but nobody was prepared to do it and the rest of it. It's&#13;
now been shifted from the IFC to the--and I pressed Canada to go ahead on this thing, but&#13;
Canada doesn't produce much photovoltaic power, so they were not deeply involved. But the&#13;
former head of the Canadian International Development Agency is now down here heading the&#13;
GEF [Global Environment Facility], and I learned last night that he is really quite interested in&#13;
doing it, and they're probably going to be meeting up in Canada to pursue this further, except&#13;
that now we're talking big, big solar farms.&#13;
&#13;
Now, big solar farms take a heck of a lot of land; I mean it's--so you're going to have to get up&#13;
into the hills. You're going to have to somehow or other shade it or cut the trees around them&#13;
and the rest of it, and I don't know that they've gone far enough on this. You can go out to the&#13;
desert, but then the desert sandstorms come in and just cover up the voltaics. And as one guy&#13;
said when I said the desert, "Well," he said, "Just take some water and wash it off." Yeah, well,&#13;
that's fine, but one of the things in the desert you're short of is water. [Laughter] So my&#13;
reaction is, you know, "Why don't we get some engineers who really know about these things&#13;
and put them into place?" [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: So let me ask you, how were you offered the new position of Policy, Planning,&#13;
and Research, and what made you accept it?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: This is one thing that Conable wanted to do. At the same time, he wanted to blend&#13;
South Asia with East Asia and Pacific. He had a Turk who was here, a very competent&#13;
economist and so on, to kind of take that over. He thought that would be very good. So I was&#13;
either going to take--as I said, "There's gold in them thar hills. Give me the departure thing and&#13;
I'll leave."&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "What about being a senior vice president for Policy, Planning, and Research?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, what does this entail?" We talked about it, and I said, "All right, I'll do that."&#13;
&#13;
That's what we did. And I've waited 'til--that was '87. I had to retire when I was sixty-two, so&#13;
it was '89 and I stayed on 'til '90.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: As part of the Policy, Planning, and Research, you helped set up the&#13;
environmental department.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: That's right. The environmental department was one of these. I got some things&#13;
going on the strategic planning thing. I ran into some very, very real battles within the&#13;
organization. Ernie Stem took over the Treasury, the money side of the Bank, was now prepared&#13;

&#13;
                to go to the U.S. system of handling things; that is, it will be an annual budget, if you don't spend&#13;
                it in the year you've got it, you lose it. I opposed that because one of the things we were doing in&#13;
                Policy, Planning and Research was getting some research going outside of the Bank and getting&#13;
                some universities, India and so on and so forth, to do the research, but I'm not about to give them&#13;
                a full grant. I want something coming in; you start off and maybe it's a five-year period, but I'm&#13;
                not going to pay anything to them unless we do it. And Stern just insisted, "Well, if you don't&#13;
                spend it in that first year, it's gone."&#13;
&#13;
                Well, what I had to do was to dribble it, the same way as I did it at IDRC or anyone ofthe&#13;
                foundations--I was on the Rockefeller Foundation board at the time, and that's the way you did&#13;
                it. You put the money out, and then they respond, and as they respond, you add some more to it,&#13;
                but you just don't give them a grant and let them go buy a Mercedes and travel around the world&#13;
                and say, "Oh, yes, yes, yes. I forgot about that." Well, we had battles about this.&#13;
&#13;
                We had battles about whether or not this whole strategic thing was something that we should be&#13;
                doing. Barber really didn't understand what the role of strategic planning was, which is kind of&#13;
                an upper echelon thing that you share with the president. He gives you his reactions. You don't&#13;
                share it with others.&#13;
&#13;
6"              When it came to policy, the Senior Vice President for&#13;
(""o.,f                        's a Pathan or a Pashtun.&#13;
:;;;;                                                            He Just SImply went to Conable and said he's not&#13;
0::: ~                                                    s responsible for what's going on in terms of the Bank's&#13;
~         .,8   activities, and he will take that over. That's his policy area. So Barber kind of, okay, that was&#13;
          8'    fine. So we just got cut out. So the whole ofthe lending policy question just disappeared. So&#13;
          &amp;l    that went by the board. They changed the title on the next guy but the ...&#13;
&#13;
                It--this was Barber Conable's kind of introduction to the Bank. He didn't take very long. He&#13;
                came in following Clausen in '86 basically. And he wanted things changed fast, and he got&#13;
                things going, and by , 87 we had his new vision of what the Bank was to be about, and this was&#13;
                the amalgamation of Africa. It turns out that Kim [Edward V. K.] Jaycox is the one who did this,&#13;
                and one of Barber's strongest supporters up in his own district was Jaycox's mother who had&#13;
                money and supported Barber as a Republican and the rest of it. And he spent many years--he&#13;
                was a country lawyer--and he spent many years in Congress and was the ranking Republican&#13;
                member during the [Jimmy] Carter era and the House Appropriations Committee and so on.&#13;
                This is what he brought to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                FEL TAUL T: And in creating the environmental department, I found a lot of correspondences&#13;
                between you and the Bank and the Nature Conservancy as assisting in kind of getting the&#13;
                department up and running. And what role exactly did they play in ..&#13;
&#13;
                HOPPER: They were among the more genuine ofthe greens, as far as I was concerned, Nature&#13;
                Conservancy. There were two or three others that were involved, but they were quite vocal in&#13;
                what they wanted to see done and so on and so forth. And I had to talk this stuff over with my&#13;
                own staff.&#13;
&#13;

 We brought in a,J'Jew Zealander who had a very, very high reputatiQ!}i!L4ealing with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 I brought Danny [Daniel] Hillel in to the environment department. He was an irrigation&#13;
 specialist and one of the world's leading irrigation people, an Israeli.                                 C)&#13;
                                                                                                     M..I'.)&#13;
&#13;
 FELTAUL T: Now, had he been on your staff in South Asia?                                            t: g&#13;
  HOPPER: No, but I knew Danny from way back. He'd worked with the Rehovot Institute,                ~  ....&#13;
  water institute in Israel. On a visit that I had made--I made a couple of visits into Israel before ~&#13;
  then when I was with IDRC and the rest of it. On one trip I went over to Syria to take a look at ~&#13;
  the Euphrates activities that they were doing. I was amazed to find that they were--well, I drove .&#13;
. over with the minister of irrigation from Damascus on this thing and looked at it, spent about the&#13;
  better part of a day visiting the Euphrates Dam and then going up to--they were pumping it up to&#13;
  Syria.&#13;
&#13;
 At the end of it, he said, well, what did I think of it.&#13;
&#13;
 I said, "I think it's Utah circa the 1930s. It isn't modem irrigation."&#13;
&#13;
 He said, "Yes, I know. Where do we get the modem irrigation?"&#13;
&#13;
 I pointed over to the Golan Heights and said, "Over there, Israel."&#13;
&#13;
 He said, "Yeah, well," he said, "I know. We tried a couple oftimes and haven't succeeded.&#13;
 How do I get it?"&#13;
&#13;
 So I went back to IDRC and got all the stuffwe wanted from Rehovot, had it all translated into&#13;
 Arabic and dropping all references to Israel and began sending it out to Egypt, to Syria, to a&#13;
 whole series of things. We published all of this stuff out of Rehovot, in terms of modem&#13;
 irrigation.&#13;
&#13;
 And I wanted Hillel to bring that in to this environment department, and he did. He just found&#13;
 them just useless in the Bank. They were just unable to talk about it. The ex-Israeli who was on&#13;
 my staff, who I still correspond with--and I do with Danny--but, you know, the Bank has not yet&#13;
 come to grips with--and I've done this. I've seen EDs [executive directors]. I've seen them&#13;
 within the institution, but the institution is not geared for it. Jim Wolfensohn is a very strong&#13;
 practicing Jew, and I have no problem on th~t. I think it's great. But he has not turned to the&#13;
 Israeli experience on this, and the result is that we're using a huge amount of the globe's water&#13;
 for irrigation purposes on crops.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    71&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
When I was in Senegal on another occasion with an FAO [Food and Agriculture Organization]&#13;
group, the Senegal River was being put out at about 40,000 cubic meters-sorry--yeah, about&#13;
40,000 cubic meters of water per hectare per wheat crop. And I asked Danny, you know, what&#13;
did they do in Israel, and it's about 10,000 cubic meters, about a quarter of it. The issue is that it&#13;
costs a heck of a lot more. It costs us now about 3200 dollars a hectare in India to irrigate it the&#13;
old British style with canals and so on and so forth down to the root zone. It would have cost&#13;
you about, what, 15, 20,000 dollars a hectare to put it under the Israeli irrigation systems where it&#13;
goes out a long pipe that has a pulse. It goes only around the root crop. It doesn't fill the whole&#13;
root zone of the horizon and so on.&#13;
&#13;
But this is what we're confronting, and we're confronting it in India. We're confronting it in&#13;
Pakistan immensely and elsewhere. We just don't have the water. In Pakistan, the area behind&#13;
Tarbela Dam, which is very important, has about 500--600 now--600 million cubic meters of just&#13;
sludge, silt, mold in the thing because what they did above Tarbela, which was a mountainous&#13;
area, they've now stripped off the trees and they're grazing cattle and goats and so on and so&#13;
forth, and the rain comes in and just flows down and washes out the soil and down it goes and it&#13;
sits behind Tarbela Dam. There's no place you can move it because the Indus River--it's way up&#13;
the Indus River, and anytime you try to move the silt down, the guys downstream holler like hell.&#13;
"We don't want all of this stuff." So you could say, "Put some shovels in and take it out," but&#13;
where do you put it? I mean, you know, where do you throw it? I mean, it's--this is the issue&#13;
that they're confronting.&#13;
&#13;
Drinking water in India is now desperately short in the rural areas. This is when I said, "Bijli,&#13;
sarak, pani, "power, roads, water, because they haven't got them. And I've taken this up with&#13;
the Indian ED's. I've taken it up with Wolfensohn and so on. "Yes, yes, yes. We'll get around&#13;
to these sorts of things," But in the meantime, what do you do?&#13;
&#13;
Last year the estimate that I got from [Callisto E.] Madavo, the Vice President for Africa--and I&#13;
haven't seen the Bank's report; I'll see it in the autumn--but last year, 2002 to 2003, they put out&#13;
about 3.6 billion dollars for sub-Saharan Africa; 2.8 of it was for structural adjustment, and there&#13;
was some for HIV, and there was some for, you know, some other things. But--and why&#13;
structural adjustment? Well, there were country reports that, "We used your money for schools&#13;
and for roads and for women's needs and so on and so forth," and that looks all very good except&#13;
that the dollars that we gave them--because that's what we gave them--is fungible, and they&#13;
bought Mercedes Benzes and took trips around the globe and reinforced the arms to their&#13;
armories and armaments and armies and so on. What's there?&#13;
&#13;
And when you talk with the Africans who are here on the issue we are dealing with--grain in&#13;
Africa or the fact that there's big food shortages in Africa, et cetera--what they point to is the fact&#13;
that, okay, it goes to structural adjustment. It's not going to really building what are the essences&#13;
that we built in South Asia with the Green Revolution, where the money did go for roads, for&#13;
irrigation--not modern irrigation, mind you, but irrigation--expanding markets, helping market&#13;
towns, opening up rural credit, not for farmers particularly but for the buyers of the fertilizer, et&#13;
cetera. If they hit a drought, then they've got some kind of credit protection on it. We built the&#13;
food corporation of India that took the excess food off, a whole array of transport questions and&#13;
&#13;

                               April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                        72&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
so on and so forth, that got opened. Seed, seed production. And all of these components were&#13;
pieces of this thing called the Green Revolution. Now I read stuff coming out in Science and so&#13;
on and so forth saying, "Well, the Green Revolution wasn't all that much a success and the rest&#13;
of it," but totally forgetting the entire set of other institutions that you built--fertilizer plants and&#13;
all the rest of it--that were absolutely critical to getting this thing out to the farms and getting it&#13;
used.&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAULT: Most of the critiques that I have read on the Green Revolution have more to do&#13;
with equity issues, which I know was a big topic in the '70s and '80s.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Listen, this was a big topic in the '60s, my dear, when V.K.R.V. Rao at Delhi&#13;
University, an economist, proceeded to hold a meeting in 1966, March '66, and brought all&#13;
together all the economists from around India, top economists, to discuss what do we do we do&#13;
about--do we bring in wheat from Mexico and rice and urea and so on for Indian agriculture?&#13;
Without question, the economists as a bloc said no. Why? Because the whole of the Indian&#13;
development movement is built upon equity. You do this and, by god, the Punjab is going to&#13;
move way ahead of the rest ofIndia, Madhya Pradesh and the rest of it where they don't have&#13;
irrigation and they'll be left behind. "No. How can we trust this material, and it comes in and&#13;
handled? No. We need the money to build our own industrial infrastructure and so on. Right&#13;
now we're getting money from--we're farming the fields of Kansas and Saskatchewan. Let's&#13;
continue to do that. They're doing it under promissory notes and so on, so we don't need to&#13;
worry about it. But that is what we should be focusing on, is building the industry of India," et&#13;
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.&#13;
&#13;
There were two people there--a guy by the name of Dave Hopper and a guy by the name of&#13;
Khilone [phonetic], something Khilone [phonetic]--who got up and said, "You've got to feed&#13;
your country. The only way we're going to do this is to break out of the present thing. The&#13;
wheats that we were demonstrating--the wheats are very, very much more productive, and the&#13;
rices that we know are available and which we have tested and have scattered arQund are very&#13;
productive." Khilone [phonetic], from the Agricultural University in the Punjab up at Ludhiana,&#13;
and Hopper from the Rockefeller Foundation.&#13;
&#13;
A guy sitting way up at the back--it's hot as blazes in the end of March it gets hot in Delhi--&#13;
sitting way up at the back the whole three days of watching this, was a man by the name of C.&#13;
Subramaniam, who was the minister of agriculture. Subramaniam, at the end of this discussion--&#13;
it was two and a half days--got up and just said, "Well, I thank you very much, Professor Rao.&#13;
This was a very edifying thing. But I want you to know that out of this entire group, only two&#13;
people have addressed my problem, Professor Khilone [phonetic] and Dr. Hopper." He said,&#13;
"My problem is how do I feed my people." And he walked out.&#13;
&#13;
That was a Friday. On Sunday I got a call from Ralph Cummings at the Rockefeller Foundation,&#13;
the head of the Rockefeller unit which I was working for. Ralph said he had just received a call&#13;
from Subramaniam, and they're putting a group on an airplane to go to Mexico to bring back&#13;
wheat, seed wheat. I said, "Ralph, never on God's earth. They won't bring back 25,000 tons.&#13;
The government of India will never be able to scrape up that money in that period of time.&#13;
Finance will be opposed to it and so on. But see what happens."&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                      73&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
On Wednesday, four guys got on an airplane, Pan Am flight to New York out of Delhi, to go to&#13;
Mexico to buy wheat. They had 5 million dollars. They bought 16,000 tons of wheat, came in&#13;
by ship. This was--wheat is planted in November, as I think I told you last time, and harvested it&#13;
in March. We got our seed then in November. March of '66--we planted in November '66,&#13;
harvested in March '67. We got a massive amount of seed. That got out in March of '67 and&#13;
was harvested in--sorry, November '67 and was harvested in March of '68, and they beat&#13;
Canada's amount of wheat, and we were away. Since then, they produce more wheat than the&#13;
United States does, second only to China on rice.&#13;
&#13;
But it took a while to build all of this. It took a huge number of institutions to be put in place.&#13;
And I don't get the sense now at the Bank that those institutions are being put in place.&#13;
&#13;
FELT AULT: Like fertilizer plants.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: The fertilizer plants, the factor markets.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: And that's what most of the loans [inaudible].&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: The roads, the et cetera that you do. And we're off over here-kind of, you know,&#13;
poverty alleviation, sustainable development, a whole series of other things that are in this thing,&#13;
and that you have to weigh all your projects against them, and is this really what we're going to&#13;
be doing. HIV at this point--I have no problem with HIV, but that's not going to do these things.&#13;
It's not going to feed people.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: The one areas that aren't away is sub-Saharan Africa. I discovered the other day&#13;
that sub-Saharan Africa, nobody is working on soils. Okay, Borlaug made a speech on soils. He&#13;
wrote something on this, and there's been other things, and I've been working with FAO. But&#13;
somehow or other, African soils are very, very old soils. They're totally depleted.&#13;
&#13;
And the example I used the other day-I don't know whether I used with you before or not--was&#13;
what the Australians did. During the Second World War, we managed to increase agricultural&#13;
production by about 44,45 percent in this country. Australia couldn't do anything. Sir John&#13;
Crawford came--well, he was John Crawford then, he wasn't Sir John Crawford--but John&#13;
Crawford came here to take a look at the U.S. from the Australian agriculture ministry. And he&#13;
found that the US had an awful lot of research that was done back in the '20s and 'JOs which&#13;
wasn't applied until the Second World War, the Depression of the '30s and so forth. Australia&#13;
hadn't done this. But he found most importantly that they had done a lot of work on soils and&#13;
what were the trace minerals required and so on and so forth in soils to get agriculture really&#13;
moving.&#13;
&#13;
And he returned to Australia. He organized--reorganized, got the government to reorganize the&#13;
Australian Scientific Council to take a look at agriculture, which they never looked at before, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          W. David Hopper&#13;
                               April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    74&#13;
&#13;
soils. They found that the Australian soils were grossly depleted of nutrients. It doesn't make&#13;
any difference how much fertilizer you put on, you didn't have enough selenium to let things&#13;
grow. And they began aerial bombardments, basically, with aerial planes flying over dropping&#13;
materials on these soils. And within five years, Australia almost doubled its agricultural output,&#13;
cheap land and so on, from this soils thing.&#13;
&#13;
We've got to do the same thing in Africa. We haven't done it. The International Fertilizer&#13;
Development Center has a thing out on African soils, but nQne of it going down deep enough&#13;
into the--not in just the depth of the soil; that's important--but in terms of just the trace minerals&#13;
that have been lost over time. The slash and bum agriculture adds some of this back to the soil&#13;
again, and this is the agriculture that was used in Africa, still is used in parts of Africa. You&#13;
know, you go in, you plant grain for a couple of years on this land, trees grow up on the others,&#13;
then you go off and cut that, let it bum down. You do this, and you keep shifting around so that&#13;
every five, eight years, you're back to where you started in this thing and cutting down the trees&#13;
again and burning them up.                             .&#13;
&#13;
The difficulty is that--that's great if you've got a relatively small population that can move&#13;
around. You don't anymore. And the population growth is very, very substantial. And again,&#13;
we're back to the fact that birth rates are culturally determined in expected times, and the death&#13;
rates are dropping because we are bringing in modem medical systems and so on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: And as you took over Policy Planning, I mean that was a new position that&#13;
Conable had created.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: It seems like you had a variety of duties in that position, not just some, you know,&#13;
research and strategic planning, but there were personnel and administrative issues as well. So it&#13;
seems like a rather all-encompassing position.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: It was.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: Can you tell me how you dealt with that and what were some of the issues?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: We had regular meetings. I had the-Stan [Stanley] Fischer I appointed as my&#13;
economist and head of the economics thing. We held weekly meetings in terms of what was&#13;
going on, where they were, and what they were doing. And these were broad-based in the sense&#13;
that other directors that I had under me would come to them and we would hold our discussions.&#13;
I had the budget group. Bob [Robert] Picciotto was running the budget group. There was a&#13;
whole set of budget issues that needed to be done. I had to project forward in a way that the&#13;
Bank hadn't done in the past in terms of expenses and incomes and the rest of it. Conable was&#13;
an old hand at the budget in Congress, and he wanted to see not dissimilar kind of budget&#13;
projections as to what we were going to do. And Picciotto was very, very capable in handling&#13;
this. I got, brought in some people, a partner from Price Waterhouse and so on and so forth,&#13;
part-time to take a look at this and to see if we couldn't get the thing balanced up and a different&#13;
kind of budget arrangement than we'd had before.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          W. David Hopper&#13;
                               April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   75&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I did work with--the same thing with the irrigation with a whole series of other things we have in&#13;
agriculture, but this was far more broadly based, and it was globally based, and what needed to&#13;
be done. The issue of the Brazilian rainforest came up, and the questions that you had there, the&#13;
problems of industrial investments which you had in things like Sao Paolo and so on, and the&#13;
slum issues that you had in Rio and up into the northern part of Brazilian east, et cetera, arose. It&#13;
was just a collection of the whole range of activities.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: How did you determine what your research agenda would be? Did that go by the&#13;
calendar year or the needs of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: No. It pretty much came out of what were the issues that they were discussing in&#13;
various levels in the institution. It was a broad-based sort of thing. I didn't-I mean, once the&#13;
decision was made that I was not going to do policy for the project people, I didn't feel at all&#13;
constrained as to what else we were going to be doing, and so, you know, we got into a wide&#13;
range of different activities.&#13;
&#13;
But, as I say, it was as a courtier and not as a baron. I think I preferred being a baron.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: In that case, on paper it looks like it's a baron position, let me put it that way--on&#13;
paper. So what in your mind made it not that?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: The issue with the baron is that there is a great deal of detail that is occurring, that&#13;
you're watching, that is being reported, et cetera, and you have different perspectives that you're&#13;
going to get on it. The position of the courtier, your answer went up to this larger group above,&#13;
and they're coming in with various kinds ofthings that they want to do. Conable would hold&#13;
meetings and say, "Well, this is--what about this?" and so on and so forth. You'd have a debate&#13;
around the table with the senior vice presidents and such others as you wanted to bring in. Then&#13;
Conable would say, "That's fine," and we'd go on to the next issue. Then Conable would go,&#13;
typical lawyer, and write his judgment, and two days later you'd get the judgment, or three days&#13;
later you'd get the judgment as to what we were going to do. This was it.&#13;
&#13;
None of the barons were subject to this. [Laughter] It was the upper level group that was&#13;
engaged in it. This is where it was. And you had everything from issues of democracies to&#13;
issues of what do we do with apartheid rules in South Africa, how do we handle the Lesotho&#13;
business that has to be looked at because we're not lending to South Africa because of their&#13;
apartheid, and the UN, and, and, and, and, and.&#13;
&#13;
And I had to go up to the UN with some frequency, talk to them in the UNDP. It used to be that&#13;
I'd go to the South Asia guy, but now it was the Director General at the UN, drop in and talk&#13;
with whoever he was, the secretary general up there, and this sort of business, and UNESCO-I&#13;
remember we had all of these things lined up.&#13;
&#13;
I brought, bluntly--I was two years from retirement, and, okay, this was all right, but it wasn't. It&#13;
wasn't really what I wanted to be doing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    76&#13;
&#13;
FEL TAUL T: Right. But that first year, didn't Conable reorganize the whole entire Bank?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Yeah, he did.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: So how was that in respect to what you were trying to do?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Okay, I had to figure out what needed to be done. One of the things was the&#13;
environment issue. One of the other was the strategic planning. Another one was the question of&#13;
getting the research group and economics group kind of in line and so on and so forth. And I did&#13;
some things there. They were weak on much of this before. They had some good economists&#13;
and that sort of thing, but the statistical base wasn't really very serious, and I got going on that. I&#13;
got going on some others. It was a participatory sort of activity, that's all&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, we were dealing with how do we restructure the Bank and the rest of it, and I&#13;
was fairly active on the fact that I felt the competency to assess this restructuring game--we had&#13;
to knock down the old 1818 H Building. It was built back in 1941. By 1975 the DC government&#13;
were no longer checking the boilers and so on because they couldn't be replaced. Well, then the&#13;
question was, do we lower them from the ceiling down, put them into the basement, leave the&#13;
building intact? Well, then we found there was asbestos all through the building, so it had to be&#13;
knocked out and the rest of it. You know, it just plodded on.&#13;
&#13;
I found the legal department were very, very jealous ofthe fact that they were not--they would&#13;
write the contract with Hyman [Construction Company], who were the ones to build it. I had a&#13;
son who was working for another part of Hyman--it's now Clark Construction; it was then&#13;
owned by Clark as well but another side of Hyman--who just phoned me and said, "Did you&#13;
know what the Bank is going to offer? They're laughing all the way to the bank, all the way to&#13;
our bank, to Riggs, on this, because the World Bank contract is just nuts." Well, it turns out, it&#13;
was nuts, because we didn't get a lawyer who understood American things. I mean, when I&#13;
suggested that we get a lawyer for this--oh, what's his name? an Egyptian who was our legal&#13;
friend and an old friend of mine; we served on a couple of boards together--he just about reached&#13;
across the table to throttle me, the idea that I would suggest that his lawyers couldn't do this.&#13;
Well, it turns out they couldn't do it. They had no conception of what was required from an&#13;
American lawyer thing.&#13;
&#13;
Equally, I was thunderstruck by the fact that we didn't hire an outside firm to be the client's&#13;
supervisor in all of this. We gave that to one of our people in general services, an Indian, who&#13;
knew nothing about what to do on these things, and the result being that what we estimated to be&#13;
a 90 million dollar thing with all the changes and so on and so forth turned out to be 170 million&#13;
bucks. The A building, the main building or the central concourse, is still in difficulty because&#13;
they didn't have anybody to go around and check the balances and the rest of it. Every time I go&#13;
into it, you know, the doors are not hung properly and the settlement and so on and so forth.&#13;
Well, I put all of this down in memos and forget it.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: I guess I'll just ask a couple of questions about CGIAR [Consultative Group for&#13;
International Agricultural Research], since you were president of that at the time, and then we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         W. David Hopper&#13;
                               April 2 and May 12,2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                77&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
can see if we want to have another session maybe in June ifthere's something else you want to&#13;
talk about. So you took over the--is it a presidency or a chairmanship?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: No. It's chairman of the CG group. I had been a factor--l mean, I had worked on&#13;
the CG before it was the CG. I think I outlined that to you the last time. The CG came into&#13;
being as a result of a discussion in Bellagio in 1969 and then followed up in early '70. And I&#13;
was at IDRC then; in '69 I was there for the Rockefeller Foundation because it was sponsored by&#13;
the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations. Bellagio was the Rockefeller conference center.&#13;
&#13;
And I followed the CG subsequently when I was at IDRC, and I followed a little bit when I got&#13;
to the Bank though it wasn't one of my CG things. I did work with some of the others to get CG&#13;
recognition and so on. There's a CG center in India that was put up before I got to the Bank, but&#13;
it was there.&#13;
&#13;
I have long felt that the CG needed either some kind of shift in focus or some kind of a sunset&#13;
clause, but that never came into being. I moved in as--I became chairman because I was&#13;
interested in the CG and I wanted to see it develop. And there was moves to create a CG for&#13;
forestry and a CG for fisheries and so on, and I decided all of that could come under the present&#13;
CG, there was no need to have the other, and Barber Conable agreed with that. He didn't want to&#13;
see further additions made. So it became a much, much bigger center. And I have maintained&#13;
since then that we should still have a sunset clause and let the damn thing go over the next ten&#13;
years or whatever else. The point is that when we built the CGs initially, when we built these&#13;
centers--IRRI at the Rice Institute, the first one in '62, and then picked up the Rockefeller Group&#13;
that were engaged in wheat, maize and beans and potato work in Mexico, we picked up them and&#13;
created CIMMYT. And then we took the Rockefeller program in Colombia and made CIAT out&#13;
of it. Then we put a new one into Africa at lIT A. This was Ford and Rockefeller and IDRC.&#13;
This was the mix. I was working with Ford and with Rockefeller when those four centers were&#13;
created.&#13;
&#13;
The centers got too much for the blood of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations continuously, so&#13;
in ' 69 they held a meeting of the aid donors, bilateral aid donors, and the World Bank.&#13;
McNamara supported it and so on. Out of that grew the CG system. Nobody knew how it was&#13;
going to work. McNamara picked it up. We created the CG. And in November--or, sorry, in&#13;
December of '70, it was kind of--now it was on the docket, and March of '71 the first meeting of&#13;
the CG took place, and I was there representing IDRC.&#13;
&#13;
I then got put on the TAC, so I left--the Technical Advisory Committee to this group--and I&#13;
stayed on the TAC for several years. I followed the CG indirectly in the Bank. I knew what was&#13;
going on elsewhere. And when it came time, and I was now Senior Vice President, and I was no&#13;
longer just South Asia, I felt I could take the CG over as chairman, and I did. We added the&#13;
forestry and fisheries to it and added some other things.&#13;
&#13;
But I warned people then that we were going to be--that when it began, the research capability in&#13;
most of these better, the larger developing countries was relatively small. It was now&#13;
substantially larger. We had educated a lot more people and sent them back and so on and so&#13;
forth. U.S. AID had put a lot of money into ag universities in India and Pakistan and the rest of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        W. David Hopper&#13;
                              April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     78&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
it. And is this something that the Bank needed to keep going? Well, the general feeling was,&#13;
yes, we did. The donors that came were very, very there. I left the CG in what I thought was&#13;
reasonable shape but still concerned that we should say that, "Okay, ten years we should be out&#13;
of it."&#13;
&#13;
Then you have the IT revolution, and the question is, "Can you do this?" Okay, the CG centers&#13;
communicate with each other and so on. Have they communicated with the centers in the&#13;
developing countries? The answer is generally no. The dialogue is not easily there.&#13;
Furthermore, the centers have become increasingly kind of taking up 90 percent of the budget to&#13;
just pay their staff and so on. It's not going out elsewhere, and I've been very critical of this.&#13;
&#13;
Uma Lele has written quite a long report on it. Borlaug had a letter--this was the guy who won&#13;
the Nobel Prize on the basis of his wheat. And Borlaug doesn't write. He sent a cable off once&#13;
to the Rockefeller Foundation years and years before, 1955 or so, when they kept pressing him to&#13;
contribute because anybody who worked for the Rockefeller Foundation has to send in an annual&#13;
report that is included in the annual report of the Rockefeller Foundation. Borlaug kept ignoring&#13;
it and so on. They finally, you know, insisted, and Borlaug finally sent a cable which I found in&#13;
the Rockefeller archives, you know: "What do you want? Paper or bread? Borlaug."&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
Borlaug has a letter in the February issue of Science, the February 20 issue of Science this year,&#13;
really castigating the CGs, that they've just gone way out of whack, and they have. There are a&#13;
lot of reasons for that, and I won't go into them here, but the CGs have become bureaucratic to&#13;
the eyeballs. What was a secretariat, a little secretariat in the Bank has now become a big, big&#13;
secretariat with all kinds of paper being written and so on and so forth and support the Hunger&#13;
Foundation or whatever else it's called and the rest of it. And the costs are in the hundreds of&#13;
millions, 3 to 400 million dollars that have been going into this, and the developing countries are&#13;
not any better off. I mean, it's--you can get this stuffthere, but there is still no discussion as to&#13;
what you do about it.&#13;
&#13;
This is my problem at F AO. They've got test plots all over the place but no way to make it&#13;
national, no way to expand it.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: To tum it into policy or operationalize it.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: That's right. Or to get the countries to do it. I mean, it's the countries that have to&#13;
do it. As long as you've got the food corporations there and as long as you've got the Europeans&#13;
willing to dump food into Africa relatively inexpensively and you're fighting the WTO now on&#13;
cotton here in the United States, which the developing countries are saying, "We can grow over&#13;
here. Why the hell are you growing it there?" And sugar--we're growing our own and charging&#13;
a high price for it, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. It was what, 312 billion dollars went to subsidies&#13;
in agriculture--Europe, Japan, and the United States--last year, and the developing countries&#13;
can't compete with it, and that's what's going on.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: They're also not allowed to subsidize their own industries, are they?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         W. David Hopper&#13;
                               April 2 and May 12, 2004 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 79&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: Agriculture. That's right.&#13;
&#13;
I ran into this thing the other day in Ethiopia. The Ethiopians are having very grave difficulty&#13;
right now, and they're going to have to be on food thing again. One of the reasons is that they&#13;
need 300 million dollars worth of fertilizer, and the World Bank and the IMF have told them no.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: On what grounds?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: It hurts your budget. You have to subsidize it to the farmers because it's a long&#13;
haul, transport haul, et cetera. They can't afford to pay for it. And here you are.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAUL T: That is the effect of structural adjustment programs.&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: It's the effect of structural adjustment, and it's is the effect of--what does the&#13;
government do. The State Department wants it to be a democracy. The farmers are saying,&#13;
"What the hell? Why should we have this when we can't get any help from our government?"&#13;
and so on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
FELTAULT: It's interesting. You have to question what's carrying more weight--their balance&#13;
of payments or their food security at this point?&#13;
&#13;
HOPPER: And on the food security, the last time they had a bumper crop, Ethiopia refused to&#13;
put it into storage because we told them not to. Markets would look after it. The markets would&#13;
look after it. Prices dropped, and farmers just quit, saying, "Well, the hell with this. I'm not&#13;
going to put that in again. I'll put in much, much smaller amounts." They were hit by a drought.&#13;
Here we are now dumping food--or were then dumping food into it. But instead of creating a&#13;
food corporation in India, which we did, to take the surpluses off and to hold them in high&#13;
quality storages so that if the drought does hit, they've got it: no way. This is just not in that--&#13;
it's not on that horizon. And again, you're back to the MBAs and the economists, not to people&#13;
who know how to grow food or handle it.&#13;
&#13;
FELT AULT: Why don't we stop here and see if we need to have a third session to talk more&#13;
abdut the Policy Planning and Research or ifthere is anything-it might be good after you read&#13;
the two transcripts, if there's anything you want to add.&#13;
