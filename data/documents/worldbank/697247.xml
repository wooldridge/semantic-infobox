REPUBLIC OF TOGO&#13;
EDUCATION REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:                Republic of Togo&#13;
Implementing Agency:    Ministry of National Education and Scientific Research (MENRS)&#13;
Beneficiaries:           Primary and secondary school students under the aegis of the Ministry of&#13;
National Education and Scientific Research&#13;
Credit Amount:            SDR 23.3 million (US$36.6 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:                   Standard IDA terms with 40 years&#13;
Project Objectives:      This operation is designed to reverse the rapid deterioration in the education&#13;
sector in Togo following several years of social and political unrest and a&#13;
decade of declining enrollment and quality.  It is based on priorities&#13;
described in the Govermment's Letter of Education Sector Policy. The&#13;
project has two objectives: (a) to improve the quality of schools; and (b) to&#13;
develop better education system management.&#13;
Project Description:     The project's support to the implementation of the education sector strategy&#13;
would be provided through two components:&#13;
1.  The project would support the development of better schools&#13;
through: (a) school construction and rehabilitation; (b) provision of&#13;
textbooks; and (c) the Quality Schools Initiative.&#13;
2. The project would support the development of better education&#13;
system management through: (a) decentralized recruitment and financing&#13;
of teachers; and (b) development of system management tools including: (i)&#13;
information and communication systems; (ii) budgetary programming and&#13;
monitoring; and (iii) consolidation of the ministerial restructuring by&#13;
strengthening decision-making processes and further decentralizing the&#13;
responsibility for instructional as well as financial management.&#13;
Benefits:                The main benefits of the proposed project will be improved education quality&#13;
and access as a result of a more adequate supply of primary school teachers,&#13;
rebuilding of infrastructure badly damaged by recent vandalism and neglect,&#13;
and greater availability of pedagogic materials at the primary and secondary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                             iii&#13;
school levels. The institutional capacity building carried out under the&#13;
project will be an essential step for ensuring the presence of teachers in&#13;
classrooms and for reversing declining enrollment trends. The establishment&#13;
of consultative regional school boards and a region-based Education Support&#13;
Fund will present the potential for a significant reduction in unit salary costs&#13;
as well as a corresponding opportunity for increasing the number of teachers&#13;
in place and for reallocating the sectoral budget in favor of needed non-&#13;
salary operating expenditures.&#13;
Risks:                    The main risks of the project are the politically unstable environment which&#13;
could significantly increase the likelihood of implementation delays and&#13;
difficulties in assuring adequate budgetary resources to finance&#13;
Government's counterpart contribution including payment of auxiliary&#13;
teachers. Other risks to achievement of project objectives are Government's&#13;
capacity to address broad institutional, finance and political issues critical to&#13;
the success of the reform program and low sectoral capacity to oversee the&#13;
Quality Schools Initiative on an ongoing basis. The risks presented by the&#13;
politically unstable environment are addressed to some extent in project&#13;
design, with an emphasis on working teams supported by coordinated short-&#13;
term interventions of external expertise. Budgetary issues are addressed&#13;
through up-front agreement on budget targets that are included in&#13;
Government's Letter of Education Sector Policy and that will be monitored&#13;
through a planned Public Expenditure Review, and annual budget reviews.&#13;
The Government's commitment to address institutional capacity issues has&#13;
been expressed through its Letter of Education Sector Policy which includes&#13;
specific institutional reform targets; these would be closely monitored&#13;
throughout project implementation. The issue of low sectoral capacity to&#13;
oversee the Quality Schools Initiative would be addressed through the use&#13;
of short-term consultancies to provide training and research experience to&#13;
Ministry and University of Benin personnel, who would in turn provide&#13;
training to inspectors and pedagogic counselors on an ongoing basis. The&#13;
Quality Schools Initiative would over the long term shift responsibility for in-&#13;
service training to the schools and prefectures and away from the current&#13;
unproductive centralized approach.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF TOGO&#13;
EDUCATION REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
L INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The Government of Togo has requested IDA's assistance to finance a five-year Education&#13;
Rehabilitation Project. This project is designed to reverse the decline in education sector net&#13;
enrollment and quality. It addresses primarily short-term needs arising from the 1992-93 general&#13;
strike, while rebuilding the sector in a way that is consistent with sectoral policy and medium- and&#13;
long-term development objectives.  It will also put in place mechanisms to facilitate the&#13;
implementation of key features of this strategy, notably the decentralization of education&#13;
management and finance. This operation would be the first phase of two education sector&#13;
operations planned to implement broad-based sector reform. The second operation would&#13;
accelerate development of the education system by further strengthening school-level teaching and&#13;
learning processes and reinforcing the sustainability of sector financing, and decentralized&#13;
management.&#13;
1.2   The Bank's previous involvement in the education sector in Togo includes two general&#13;
education projects, now closed (Cr. 101 8-TO, Cr. 1568-TO), and an ongoing Technical Education&#13;
and Vocational Training Project (Cr. 2174-TO). The latter aims at restructuring and&#13;
decentralizing the VET system through a national training fund to make it employment oriented&#13;
and responsive to the skill demands of Togo's private sector. The results of these projects have&#13;
underscored the need to closely monitor the broad policy and institutional environment and to&#13;
focus on issues of implementation. Experience has demonstrated that meeting specific resource&#13;
needs will be insufficient to bring about either sustainable improvement in teaching and learning&#13;
outcomes that require the availability of personnel, basic materials and equipment, or regional and&#13;
gender equity, in the absence of complementary measures designed to strengthen planning and&#13;
management capacity, reorient incentives, and redefine policies and operational strategies. The&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project is designed to address these issues.&#13;
1.3   The Country Assistance Strategy for Togo assigns a high priority to the strategy and&#13;
activities envisaged under the project in support of the central role that human resource&#13;
development must play in the economic renaissance of the country. The Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy stresses that the development of education sector policy must be pursued within a&#13;
difficult macroeconomic framework. Sectoral policy should hence be monitored closely and&#13;
developed further over the life of the project. Project preparation has been a broadly participative&#13;
process, and the supervision of the project would include annual review meetings and a mid-term&#13;
review with representation of all stakeholders involved in the sector as well as beneficiary&#13;
assessments.&#13;

II. SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
2.1   Togo is a low-income country with an estimated per capita GNP of US$315 in 1994 and a&#13;
population of 3.9 mnillion that is rapidly growing at an annual rate of 3.1 percent. The economy&#13;
has traditionally depended on primary production, service activities and exports of phosphates and&#13;
cotton. Agricultural production is concentrated in food crops, cotton, coffee and cocoa. About 75&#13;
percent of the active population is employed in agriculture which accounts for about 38 percent of&#13;
GDP. The service sector consists mainly of commerce and transit activities.&#13;
2.2   As a result of favorable trends in primary commodity prices, facilitated by political&#13;
stability, the Togolese economy experienced almost two decades of uninterrupted real growth in&#13;
excess of 5 percent per annum through the late 1970s. During the period 1974-78, however,&#13;
growth increasingly stemmed from an excessive and externally-financed expansion of the public&#13;
sector, leading to increasing external and intemal financial imbalances and mounting structural&#13;
rigidities. A partial stabilization program was launched in 1979, but after four years of stagnating&#13;
economic activity and continual financial problems, the Togolese Government recognized the&#13;
need for a more comprehensive recovery policy.&#13;
2.3   In response, the first in a series of structural adjustment programs was launched in 1983.&#13;
These programs have all been supported by the IMF and by the Bank, most recently through SAL&#13;
IV which was approved by the Board in December 1990. The thrust of these programs has been&#13;
to reduce the external and internal financial imbalances, cut back the Government's role in the&#13;
economy while improving its efficiency in using public resources, and improve the incentives&#13;
framework for private sector activities. Until early 1991, substantial progress was achieved in&#13;
implementing the structural reforms, while significantly reducing the internal and external financial&#13;
imbalances. During the period 1984-89, Togo was considered as one of the best economic&#13;
performers in Western Africa, with real GDP growth of 3.4 percent p.a. on average.&#13;
B. Recent Developments&#13;
2.4   Political Developments. A deep political crisis was precipitated in 1991, when the&#13;
regime came under increasing pressure to establish a multi-party system. This interrupted Togo's&#13;
successful economic recovery of the 1980s. The period was marred by violent street riots and&#13;
mass civil disobedience. A national conference, convened in July 1991, led to the formation of a&#13;
one-year transition Government. Parliamentary and presidential elections were scheduled for July&#13;
1992 but political violence disturbed the electoral calendar, paralyzing economic activity from&#13;
November 1992 through July 1993. The political situation improved during the second half of&#13;
1993. In August 1993, President Eyadema was reelected for a five-year term and legislative&#13;
elections were completed in March 1994.&#13;
2.5   Economic Developments. The combination of socio-political turmoil and compression of&#13;
Government expenditures, exacerbated by the drying up of foreign aid, led to a severe contraction&#13;
of the economy. During 1991-93, GDP fell by 17 percent, revenues dropped by 47 percent, and&#13;
by end-1993, the overall fiscal deficit widened to 14.5 percent of GDP. During 1992-93, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                  3&#13;
Government increase of domestic payment arrears amounted to about CFAF 37 billion (10% of&#13;
GDP). The substantial drop in net foreign financing led to a marked deterioration in the overall&#13;
balance of payments. By end-1993, external payment arrears amounted to the equivalent of US$&#13;
111 million.&#13;
2.6   Post Devaluation Developments. The devaluation of the CFA Franc in January 1994,&#13;
the formation of a new Government in June 1994 and the preparation of a three-year Policy&#13;
Framework Paper (PFP) set the stage for greater political stability and the country's economic&#13;
recovery. The 1994/95-1996/97 PFP provides the macroeconomic framework required for the&#13;
resumption of structural reforms interrupted by the political turmoil of the last three years. During&#13;
1994, the economy showed clear signs of recovery and real growth is estimated to about 11&#13;
percent spurred by increased production of traditional export crops (cotton and coffee) and a&#13;
strong recovery of mining and manufacturing. The external current account deficit was limited to&#13;
8 percent of GDP. The current primary budget deficit was contained to about 5 percent of GDP.&#13;
However, despite improved performance in 1994, Government revenues amounted to only about&#13;
half Government expenditures. Togo's budgetary situation is expected to remain tight in 1995,&#13;
1996 and 1997.&#13;
C. Education Sector Background&#13;
1. Structure&#13;
2.7   Togo's education system consists of a six-year cycle of primary education, a four-year&#13;
lower-secondary cycle, a three-year upper-secondary cycle, and a range of higher education&#13;
programs from two to eleven years in length at the University of Benin. The Ministry of National&#13;
Education and Scientific Research (MENRS) is responsible for general education programs; the&#13;
Ministry of Technical Education and Vocational Training (METFP) is responsible for vocational&#13;
training. The organization of the formal education system is presented in Annex I.&#13;
2. Administration&#13;
2.8   Operations within the two ministries are highly centralized: while regional offices for&#13;
educational planning and school mapping exist, they are branches of the corresponding central&#13;
structures. Togo's teaching corps is highly fragmented, with teachers falling into a number of&#13;
separate categories for administrative purposes. The University of Benin has semi-autonomous&#13;
status within the MENRS and receives a block grant for payment of operational expenditures and&#13;
teachers. Approximately 66 percent of primary and secondary school teachers have regular civil&#13;
service status. In addition to the 15,668 teachers and administrators with civil service status, (this&#13;
figure includes 2,400 teachers in church-run schools for whom the Government pays 80 percent&#13;
of civil service salary rates), approximately 4,300 auxiliary teachers are hired on a contract basis&#13;
through a variety of Government programs and local initiatives: (a) the Ministry of Labor&#13;
manages a " national service" training and employment program (Programme d'emploi et&#13;
formation--PEF) under which approximately 1,400 primary teachers, 330 lower-secondary&#13;
teachers, and 565 upper-secondary teachers are hired on the basis of renewable, low-cost&#13;
contracts (at 20 to 40 percent of civil service wage rates): (b) collectivities have hired teachers&#13;
largely through parental contributions (approximately 1,355 primary teachers); (c) inspectorates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                     4&#13;
have paid auxiliary teacher salaries with funds generated in part from school fees and intended for&#13;
their travel and operating budgets; and (d) parents' groups have hired teachers independently (at&#13;
pay rates averaging between 5 to 10 percent of civil service rates).&#13;
2.9    Auxiliary primary school teacher salaries vary widely: locally hired teachers average&#13;
approximately CFAF 7,000 monthly, although some receive no cash payments and are paid in&#13;
kind. Underqualified teachers on Government contracts receive CFAF 20,000 monthly; teachers&#13;
with a four-year secondary certificate (brevet) receive CFAF 25,000 monthly and teachers with&#13;
high school diplomas (baccalaureat) or above receive CFAF 30,000 monthly. This compares to&#13;
an average of CFAF 90,000 monthly for starting civil service teachers, including benefits.&#13;
Secondary school teachers on contract receive either CFAF 65,000 or 70,000 monthly depending&#13;
on qualifications. This is about one half of civil service rates for beginning secondary teachers,&#13;
including benefits.&#13;
3. Sector Development Issues&#13;
2.10  Unplanned and unsustainable sector development. Since 1984, recruitment of civil&#13;
servants in Togo has been frozen. In the education sector, this has given rise to a number of&#13;
alternative and sometimes makeshift arrangements as described above, in order to replace retired&#13;
or deceased teachers or to meet growing demand. These arrangements have been extremely&#13;
unstable, and have resulted in school closings and frequent disruption of school programs and&#13;
occasional strikes. The present fiscal crisis has exacerbated these problems, with the most severe&#13;
problems created in rural areas, because urban schools more easily attract civil service teachers&#13;
from rural areas to replace retiring teachers.&#13;
2.11   The economic crisis caused a serious deterioration in the quality and access to basic&#13;
education, which was, even before 1990, characterized by inadequate budgetary allocations,&#13;
inefficiency, and lack of relevance to the needs of a developing economy. At a functional level,&#13;
many classrooms were severely overcrowded and teacher training was non-existent. The work of&#13;
inspectors, directors and other personnel was organized in ways that provided almost no&#13;
instructional support. Primary school enrollment ratios had been deteriorating, as had most&#13;
indicators of instructional quality. At 36 percent and 46 percent respectively, student repetition&#13;
and drop-out rates were among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, and a disproportionately low&#13;
number of girls were in school. There were systemic biases in favor of urban schooling, and in&#13;
favor of higher levels of education. Secondary school teachers were often inefficiently distributed&#13;
and underutilized. In general, policy making has been a highly centralized process.&#13;
2.12  The general strike in 1992-93 brought the educational system to a complete halt for six&#13;
months, and further weakened a sector that had already been in steady decline for more than a&#13;
decade. Following the strike, although classes have resumed, educational material is lacking,&#13;
many auxiliary teachers recruited by the commnunities are still not being paid and instructional&#13;
standards continue to fall as a result of a significant cut in inspectors' budgets and increased&#13;
reliance on untrained teachers. While the situation is serious across the country, it is particularly&#13;
acute in the Savannah and Central regions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                     5&#13;
2.13   Rural/urban disparities. A number of features within the current Togolese education&#13;
system mitigate against equal schooling opportunities for rural children. The freeze on hiring&#13;
teachers through the civil service has meant that as teachers retire in urban areas, there is a&#13;
tendency that they are replaced by teachers from rural schools. This leaves the rural schools with&#13;
a perennial teacher shortage, with no other recourse than to finance teachers with whatever&#13;
sources of funding are available locally (parents' comrnittees, inspectors' travel and operational&#13;
budgets, NGOs, etc.). In the rural Savannah region, for instance, 41 percent of all teachers are&#13;
financed locally, whereas only 17 percent of teachers are financed locally in the capital city of&#13;
Lome. The result is uneven teaching quality for children in rural areas, and significantly fewer&#13;
opportunities to attend school and to advance through the grades. The net schooling rate in the&#13;
country is estimated at 61 percent (1993-94), although statistical data are not reliable and&#13;
enrollment rates vary from approximately 85 percent in the capital region to only 30 percent in the&#13;
rural Savannah region. The lack of school mapping capacity has been a handicap to efforts to&#13;
establish a sector expansion program sensitive to gender equity concerns. The lack of school&#13;
mapping capacity further hinders the development of rural schooling.&#13;
2.14  Gender equity. The nation's female literacy rate is substantially lower than that among&#13;
men (31 percent versus 52 percent). In rural areas the situation is worse as less than 15 percent of&#13;
women are literate. The percentage of female students in the educational system remained low,&#13;
and relatively unchanged, over the period 1980-90. The most striking feature concerning girls'&#13;
schooling is that initial enrollment of girls is relatively positive (42 percent of the total), but that&#13;
girls drop out of the system at astonishingly high rates: by the first year of secondary schooling,&#13;
they represent only 29 percent of the total; by the last year of secondary schooling this figure has&#13;
dropped to 12 percent. It is clear that the impact of Togo's high repetition rates is bome&#13;
disproportionately by the female students, for whom repetition commonly leads to dropout. In&#13;
several respects, the economic crisis has increased gender disparities. Female students have been&#13;
less likely to return to school after the end of the strike. The findings of recent Bank sector work&#13;
on girls' schooling in Togo will provide an important input for the quality school initiatives of the&#13;
project, as well as future interventions in this area. Some demand and household-related factors&#13;
affecting girls' schooling and the links between girls' schooling and school quality would require&#13;
further operation-based study.&#13;
2.15   Budget and finance issues. The institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education for&#13;
budget planning is weak. Resource allocation within the sector does not match the stated&#13;
priorities of the Government. The education sector's share of the national budget has dropped&#13;
from 28 percent to 19 percent, slightly below the francophone average for Sub-Saharan Africa of&#13;
22 percent; higher education receives about 25 percent of this total (1995) even though it serves&#13;
only 1 percent of the students. Secondary education receives 34 percent of the total, while&#13;
primary education receives a relatively low 41 percent of the overall sector budget. Education&#13;
budget indicators are presented in Annex II.&#13;
2.17  The breakdown of the budget by expenditure category reveals a number of imbalances.&#13;
Prior to the current economic crisis, salary expenditures in the primary education budget, for&#13;
instance, consumed approximately 98 percent of total non-administrative expenditures, leaving&#13;
very little for the purchase of textbooks, chalk, and other pedagogical inputs. The situation has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                     6&#13;
further deteriorated since then, with non-salary operating expenditures now accounting for less&#13;
than one percent of primary expenditures (excluding central administration).&#13;
2.18   Quality of instruction. There are a wide range of quality issues as regards teaching and&#13;
learning outcomes requiring immediate attention. The repetition rate is the most striking indicator&#13;
demonstrating the extent of the problem: fully 35 percent of all students in the system, at all&#13;
levels from primary to tertiary, fail each year. Few textbooks are available, pre-service training&#13;
has not been offered in ten years, and there is little in-service training. Adequate information&#13;
regarding the quality of teaching and learning is unavailable. Statistical yearbooks are being&#13;
produced almost three years late; evaluation capacity remains weak. At present, there is no&#13;
capacity for systematically sampling the level of student learning outcomes, although evaluations&#13;
of the system prepared in the mid- and late-1980s already referred to declining levels of&#13;
performance. Many classrooms are overcrowded, with students numbering as high as 200 in&#13;
urban Grade 1 classrooms. Annex m provides enrollment and repetition figures for primary and&#13;
lower secondary education.&#13;
4. Government Education Sector Strategy&#13;
2.19  The evolution of Togo's education system has been the product of a complex interaction&#13;
of factors, not all of which can be addressed at once. Immediately prior to the strike, MENRS&#13;
established its priorities for the reform process in a Letter of Education Sector Policy. It&#13;
emphasized basic education (Grades 1 through 10) and efforts to improve school quality and girls'&#13;
participation. The principal management approach for achieving this was to be through a focus&#13;
on the individual school as the locus of change. The Government also expressed a strong interest&#13;
in exploring the possibility of decentralizing most sector management functions to the regional&#13;
and prefectoral levels as a part of this shift in emphasis to the school level.&#13;
2.20  Following the strike, circumstances have forced the Government to redefine its priorities&#13;
in order to address the most pressing crises in the sector. It has prepared and submitted to IDA a&#13;
new Letter of Education Sector Policy (Annex IV) which highlights the lack of teachers and&#13;
teaching materials, and the degradation of school facilities and proposes a two phase approach to&#13;
educational reform. In the first phase, the Government seeks to restore stability to the sector by:&#13;
(i) assuring the regular payment of all primary teachers; (ii) conducting a functional audit of the&#13;
Ministry to ensure the best use of available personnel and resources to support teaching and&#13;
learning, (iii) rehabilitating classrooms; and (iv) increasing the availability of basic pedagogic&#13;
materials in conjunction with the implementation of experimental quality schools initiatives.&#13;
2.21  In parallel, during the first phase, the Government would develop mechanisms to put in&#13;
place a more decentralized system of management and financing for primary education, including&#13;
establishing five regional school boards and a decentralized Education Support Fund. Beyond its&#13;
role as a conduit for the funding of auxiliary teachers' salaries, the Fund is seen as a tool for&#13;
enabling more decentralized management of schools by regional school boards. Financing of the&#13;
Fund would be the joint responsibility of communities and the Government, with the Government&#13;
continuing to contribute most of the funding, in part through cost savings from attrition in the&#13;
civil service, on an increasing basis. Community financing during this phase would initially consist&#13;
of 40 percent of school fees, the proportion of school fees that is currently being transferred to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                   7&#13;
central Ministry. The Government would also seek donor financing to the Education Support&#13;
Fund.&#13;
2.22 In the second phase of reform, the Government would move formally toward&#13;
decentralized personnel management with the establishment of regional auxiliary teaching bodies.&#13;
The regional school boards would take over responsibility for teacher recruitment and financing&#13;
(with continuing Government contributions), in-service teacher training, as well as the&#13;
development of initiatives at the regional and school levels to improve the quality of teaching and&#13;
learning that would allow the expansion of access to primary and lower secondary schooling and&#13;
substantive improvements in instructional quality. The Government has presented to IDA a&#13;
signed Letter of Education Sector Policy a draft of which was discussed and agreed during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
5. World Bank Sector Strategy&#13;
2.23  The current project would address issues dealing with the first phase of the Government's&#13;
strategy. This includes a start to establishing a framework for the gradual transfer of management&#13;
responsibilities to the regions, a process which would be pursued under a follow-up operation.&#13;
The follow up operation would continue to support local management of teaching and learning&#13;
processes, as well as financial management and re-allocation of resources in a manner consistent&#13;
with the Government's emphasis on basic education. Activities proposed under the current project&#13;
have been designed in line with the two phase strategy and would prepare the ground for key&#13;
aspects of the follow-up project, notably to provide improved management tools to the education&#13;
system and a basic framework for longer-term decentralization of education management. The&#13;
timing of the follow-up project would be determined in large part by success in implementing the&#13;
activities planned in the present project, as well as by Government's ability to ensure sustainable&#13;
funding of the sector.&#13;
2.24  The project would ensure the availability of teachers, teaching materials, and classrooms.&#13;
The Education Ministry would be given assistance in establishing the criteria under which funding&#13;
would be granted to regional school boards, as well as procedures for transfer of funds,&#13;
accounting, auditing, etc. Financial managers would be trained for these school boards and&#13;
financial accounts and procedures would be established for each region. School and community&#13;
personnel would be trained to establish transparent procedures for managing the textbook rental&#13;
program, the rehabilitation of classrooms, the redeployment of secondary school teachers,and the&#13;
implementation of the Quality Schools Initiative to upgrade teaching quality.&#13;
2.25  In addition, the project would ensure the establishment of five decentralized school&#13;
boards, with responsibility for hiring and firing auxiliary teachers, and funding granted according&#13;
to agreed criteria, accounting and audit procedures. Redeployment of secondary school teachers&#13;
would reduce the need for auxiliary teachers at this level and free up resources for primary&#13;
education. The rehabilitation and replacement of 800 classrooms, the distribution of textbooks,&#13;
and the extension of the Quality Schools Initiative would continue to provide for the improvement&#13;
of teaching and learning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                   8&#13;
6.' Educational Management&#13;
2.26 A positive development in the evolution of management capacity within the MENRS has&#13;
already' occurred with the establishment of a sectoral Steering Committee comprised of key&#13;
departmental directors and chaired by the Minister or his representative. It was established to&#13;
take responsibility for project preparation and implementation, and has emerged as the principal&#13;
decision-making body within the ministry, with broad responsibility for policy decisions and&#13;
implementation. The Steering Committee is the primary vehicle for ensuring that information and&#13;
policy options produced during project implementation are effectively channeled into the policy&#13;
formulation process. In this context, it is also responsible for ensuring wide participation in the&#13;
preparation and implementation process, both within and outside the education ministry, and for&#13;
building consensus regarding project objectives and operational strategies.&#13;
2.27  Given the importance of intersectoral re-allocation of resources in favor of the social&#13;
sectors, and the need for a Government-wide dialogue regarding the links between education and&#13;
economic development, an interministerial committee has been established to oversee these&#13;
broader issues. Membership includes the Ministries of Education, Plan, Finance, and Employment&#13;
The interministerial committee would meet on a quarterly basis during the first year of&#13;
implementation and twice a year throughout the remaining years of the project. It would also&#13;
provide annual updates to the Government's Letter of Education Sector Policy reflecting progress&#13;
in ensuring the transition toward activities planned for the follow-up project. The interministerial&#13;
committee would also be responsible for assuring the proposed reallocation of Government&#13;
resources in favor of education.&#13;
2.28 Donor coordination. Among donors, IDA has taken the lead in the policy dialogue with&#13;
Government. Discussions have been held with all of the principal actors who have historically&#13;
been active in the sector, although some donors have suspended activities in the country. The&#13;
African Development Bank (AfDB) has intervened in the VET subsector to rehabilitate three&#13;
lower secondary vocational training centers; it has also begun to gradually replace 360 classrooms&#13;
in the central region of the country. The European Union is also considering providing support to&#13;
the primary education sector. The Japanese Governnent has already purchased library books and&#13;
is considering the construction of a number of primary classrooms in urban areas.&#13;
D. Lessons Learned&#13;
2.29  The Bank's previous involvement in the education sector in Togo underscores the need to&#13;
pay attention to how the broad policy environment affects issues of implementation, sustainability&#13;
and quality. Both the Educational Improvement Project (Education Project II) and the ongoing&#13;
Vocational Education and Training Project provide compelling examples of these concerns. The&#13;
lack of a coherent strategy to deal with insufficient funding of recurrent costs, especially for&#13;
teacher financing has been a key issue. This created an unstable and unproductive teacher&#13;
situation at all levels of the system and led to widespread teacher shortages. The provision of&#13;
science laboratory facilities to high schools, which was a key part of Education Project II, was&#13;
ultimately unsuccessful because school directors lacked the capacity to reorganize classroom&#13;
utilization pattems. The attempt to develop national pre-service teacher training institutions did&#13;
not succeed because of the Government's inability to provide the recurrent costs associated with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                   9&#13;
investment projects. Most primary pupils, especially in the rural areas, did not have access to&#13;
textbooks provided under the Education Project II because of inability to pay. These problems&#13;
have further demonstrated that meeting specific resource needs may be insufficient to produce&#13;
sustainable improvement in teaching and learning in the absence of complementary measures&#13;
designed to strengthen educational planning and management both at the central and school&#13;
levels, as well as beneficiary involvement.&#13;
mL THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Scope&#13;
3.1    Objectives and Scope. The project seeks to halt the degradation in educational services&#13;
in Togo and strengthen institutional capacity conducive to developing longer-term reform. It&#13;
does this by focusing interventions in two areas: (a) improving the quality of schools through&#13;
school construction and rehabilitation, textbook provision, and the introduction of a school-based&#13;
innovation in teaching and learning processes through the Quality Schools Initiative; and (b)&#13;
developing better education system management through decentralized recruitment and financing&#13;
of teachers and development of system management tools. With regard to better schools, the&#13;
project would: (i) rehabilitate approximately 800 classrooms, many of which were damaged or&#13;
vandalized during the ten-month period when Government virtually ceased to function in 1992-&#13;
93; (ii) finance the purchase of approximately 2,300,000 primary school textbooks and 41,000&#13;
primary teachers' guides, and approximately 510,000 lower secondary textbooks (Grades 7-10),&#13;
and 20,000 lower secondary teachers' guides, along with training on textbook use and textbook&#13;
stock maintenance; and (iii) lay the foundation for much greater school-level involvement in&#13;
developing more effective teaching and learning processes (Quality Schools Initiative). With&#13;
regard to better system management, the project would: (i) ensure the availability of teachers at&#13;
the primary school level by helping stabilize the current auxiliary teacher situation; (ii) improve&#13;
decision-making processes by strengthening information and communication systems; (iii)&#13;
overhaul the process of preparing, monitoring, and executing the operating and investment&#13;
budgets; and (iv) consolidate gains from an earlier Ministerial restructuring by focusing Ministry&#13;
functions around the teaching and learning process.&#13;
3.2   Technical Assistance, Studies and Training. Only short-term technical assistance is&#13;
envisaged under this project (about 250 man/months). The strategy adopted is to recruit high&#13;
caliber expertise with a commitment to on-the-job training and the ability to transfer skills and&#13;
knowledge to nationals (see details in Annex V and Annex XII). The consultant profiles&#13;
developed emphasize the importance of training, team building and communication skills. In&#13;
those instances where technical assistance is envisaged in the preparation of studies, the terms of&#13;
reference call for close collaboration with Togolese counterpart professionals, including Togolese&#13;
consultant firms and university personnel. Draft terms of reference for all technical assistance&#13;
during the first year of the project have been agreed upon during negotiations.&#13;

B. Project Component Description&#13;
1. Improve the Quality of Schools&#13;
3.3   In spite of the overall degradation of the sector, there have been some signs of&#13;
improvement at the central level. A sectoral Steering Committee with substantial authority has&#13;
been created and has become a strong decision-making body. Government Letter of Education&#13;
Sector Policy demonstrates an understanding on the part of the Government that creating better&#13;
schools means not only providing the proper mix of physical and pedagogical inputs, but also&#13;
paying close attention to how change occurs. It reflects the Govermnent's comniitment to collect&#13;
and disseminate reliable information about learning processes and learning outcomes, and to&#13;
establish an enabling policy environment.&#13;
3.4   These positive developments stand in stark contrast to classroom-level realities, where the&#13;
learning environment has been severely strained by the recent social and political unrest. Physical&#13;
plants degraded rapidly due to vandalism and neglect which took place during the 1992-93&#13;
general strike. School materials were stolen or damaged, and instructional leadership was greatly&#13;
diluted as inspectors' budgets disappeared or were assigned elsewhere and school principals were&#13;
obliged to spending an increasing portion of their time dealing with new administrative challenges&#13;
such as raising funds for hiring auxiliary teachers or for purchasing basic teaching and learning&#13;
materials.&#13;
3.5   In addition to the insufficiency of the physical plant, there is little shared understanding&#13;
among practitioners about how to improve the way schools operate. This is due in part to the&#13;
lack of capacity to define evaluation criteria and to collect and analyze information on school-level&#13;
performance. Little reliable information exists regarding student achievement, the performance of&#13;
teachers and school managers, and the impact of education policy and strategic interventions on&#13;
schools, teachers, and communities. In spite of the declining rate of girls' enrollment throughout&#13;
the primary cycle, for instance, gender-disaggregated data on repetition and dropout are not&#13;
readily available.&#13;
3.6   The approach adopted in developing this component has been to ensure that school&#13;
facilities are returned to acceptable minimum standards and that the window of opportunity&#13;
provided by the upgrading of the physical plant be used to establish processes within schools that&#13;
are more supportive of improved teaching and learning and would lead to sustainable economic&#13;
development.&#13;
(a) School Construction and Rehabilitation Component (base cost US$7.5 million&#13;
equivalent)&#13;
3.7   Objectives and Scope. School facilities in Togo have deteriorated over the past decade&#13;
from a general lack of upkeep and routine maintenance. Combined with widespread vandalism&#13;
and theft during the most recent civil unrest, this has left the physical infrastructure of the&#13;
education system in a state of crisis. The majority of schools provide an inadequate learning&#13;
environment, and many are unsafe. It is now estimated that over 30 percent of all schools (or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                 I 1&#13;
3,000 classrooms) will need to be replaced and a slightly smaller number (2,400) rehabilitated.&#13;
MENRS estimates that by the year 2000 a total of 8,000 classrooms will be required due to an&#13;
increasing school age population. The African Development Bank has already begun&#13;
implementation of a program to replace 360 primary classrooms.  Under the Education&#13;
Rehabilitation Project, 440 primary school classrooms would be rehabilitated and approximately&#13;
360 primary school classrooms would be replaced. This sub-component would also help establish&#13;
norms and procedures for classroom and school rehabilitation to inform the work of the other&#13;
donors and help develop a comprehensive program of maintenance and upkeep. Responsibility&#13;
for the construction and rehabilitation of schools under this component would be assigned to the&#13;
private sector and NGO's. An in-depth report on rehabilitation needs has been conducted by the&#13;
construction unit within the MENRS, with appropriate technical assistance. This report provides&#13;
the basis for private sector involvement and includes cost estimates, selection and evaluation&#13;
criteria, and procurement guidelines.&#13;
3.8   The project would provide for: (a) the rehabilitation of 440 classrooms and the&#13;
construction of 360 primary classrooms; (b) equipment, desks and vehicles; (c) technical&#13;
assistance for studies on rehabilitation needs, architectural services, and preparation of bidding&#13;
documents; and (d) technical assistance for review of procurement procedures linked to this&#13;
component, and other components as needed.&#13;
(b) Textbook Provision Component (base cost US$14.0 million equivalent)&#13;
3.9   Objectives and Scope. The Educational Improvement Project provided primary level&#13;
textbooks in French and Mathematics. They were sold through the Librairies des Mutuelles&#13;
Scolaires (LIMUSCO) at a price 50 percent less than in local private bookstores. However,&#13;
according to the Implementation Completion Report (ICR), most of the pupils, mainly in the rural&#13;
areas, did not have access to these books because of inability to pay. At the secondary level, the&#13;
textbooks that existed prior to the general strike of 1992-93 were almost all stolen or vandalized&#13;
during this period. The current project would focus on textbooks for both the primary and lower-&#13;
secondary cycles. This would include the reprinting, purchase, and distribution of textbooks and&#13;
teachers' guides, training for school directors and parents'associations in management and&#13;
maintenance of textbook stocks, and a training program for primary and secondary teachers in the&#13;
use of the textbooks.&#13;
3.10  At the primary level, this component would supply textbooks in French, Mathematics, and&#13;
Sciences at a ratio of one book per pupil (including a provision for enrollment growth) over a&#13;
five-year period. It would also provide every teacher with a guide in these subjects. To this end,&#13;
it would reprint the French and Mathematics titles which were prepared under the Educational&#13;
Improvement Project and with which teachers are familiar. Since the copyrights were granted to&#13;
private publishers until 1999 for the French titles and 2000 for the Mathematics titles, the&#13;
Government would make arrangements with the publishers to allow for the reprinting of these&#13;
titles through ICB and consequently their financing under the project. Concerning the Sciences&#13;
books, the project would purchase them through ICB on the basis of technical and pedagogical&#13;
specifications. All the books would be packed for individual schools by the suppliers and delivered&#13;
to the schools by LIMUSCO. They would be the property of the schools which would loan them&#13;
to the pupils for a symbolic parental contribution of CFAF 200 per pupil/year (approximately 5%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                 12&#13;
of the estimated cost of a set of books). Existing structures would be improved for the&#13;
management of textbooks. In each school, a committee presided over by the head teacher and&#13;
including the representatives of the teachers and the parents would use the proceeds collected to&#13;
ensure the protection and safekeeping of the books and to replace copies damaged or lost by&#13;
pupils. The committee would ensure that no pupil is denied access to books because of inability to&#13;
pay. In order to have up-to-date information on the number and state of the books in each school,&#13;
the MENRS Planning Department would computerize the primary and lower secondary book&#13;
stock inventories. DEPD will be responsible for the implementation of this component.&#13;
3.11  At the secondary level, subject panels would select one title per grade and subject from&#13;
existing books. The selected titles would be divided into packages and purchased through ICB.&#13;
The books would be packed for individual schools by the suppliers and delivered directly to the&#13;
schools by LIMUSCO. The books would become the property of the schools and be made&#13;
available to the students through a school-based rental system, which will draw on lessons learned&#13;
through the primary school textbook program. The proceeds would be used to ensure the&#13;
availability of one book for two students over a five-year period by financing repairs, replacement,&#13;
and copies for enrollment growth. According to the general guidelines of the MENRS and the&#13;
local conditions, each secondary school would create a committee for establishing and operating&#13;
its rental system. The committee would be responsible for the collection of the fees (about CFAF&#13;
1,000 per book) and their deposit in a bank account. It would use the collected fees to acquire&#13;
new textbooks. DEDD will be responsible for the implementation of this component.&#13;
3.12 During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will issue an Arrete&#13;
acceptable to IDA not later than March 31, 1996, for the establishment and operation of a&#13;
textbook loan and a decentralized rental system for primary and secondary school students&#13;
respectively, which shall include, inter alia, provisions relating to management responsibilities,&#13;
reporting and audit requirements. Details on this component are given in Annex VI.&#13;
3.13  The project would provide for: (a) the reprinting, purchase and distribution of&#13;
approximately 2,300,000 primary school textbooks and 41,000 teachers' guides; (b) the purchase&#13;
and distribution of an initial stock of approximately 510,000 textbooks for lower-secondary&#13;
schools and 20,000 teachers' guides; (c) training for primary and lower secondary teachers and&#13;
school directors in the use and maintenance of textbooks; (d) awareness campaign for parents and&#13;
parents' associations in maintaining textbook stocks, (e) technical assistance to develop the&#13;
technical and pedagogic specifications of the bidding documents and assist the Government in bid&#13;
evaluation; (f) construction of book storage facilities; and (g) computer equipment to enable&#13;
better management of the book stock inventories at MENRS and book stocks in the schools.&#13;
(c)   Quality Schools Initiative Component (base cost US$3.6 million equivalent)&#13;
3.14  Objectives and Scope. The implementation of the Education Improvement Project in&#13;
Togo showed that for in-service education programs to be successfully translated into changed&#13;
teacher behavior, they must match the felt needs of teachers in a consistent manner over time.&#13;
However, in Togo, in-service training programs have been very top-down in nature, and have&#13;
been implemented only sporadically. The teachers who have stood in greatest need of these&#13;
programs, i.e. the village-based auxiliary teachers, have frequently not had access to them.&#13;
Existing programs have often failed entirely to account for local variations in teacher and student&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                  13&#13;
needs. The Quality Schools Initiative component designed under the current operation seeks to&#13;
address this weakness by supporting stakeholder involvement in designing and carrying out an&#13;
innovative program of in-service training based on needs expressed by teachers themselves. This&#13;
program builds on existing structures to introduce teaching innovations, and would help transform&#13;
the role of the inspectors from one of administrative control to one of instructional support and&#13;
leadership.&#13;
3.15  The Togolese school system has been growing progressively weaker largely because of the&#13;
absence of adequate training for teachers. Both the pre-service and in-service training programs&#13;
were suspended during the late-1980's because of a lack of funds. Under this component, in-&#13;
service training would be re-introduced into the Togolese school system as the operational means&#13;
by which the trend of declining quality would be reversed. It would be a school-based program,&#13;
since this approach has been shown in studies elsewhere to have by far the greatest potential for&#13;
leading to positive and lasting change in teacher behavior. In order to facilitate implementation,&#13;
the component has been structured around three sub-components: (i) 50 cutting-edge&#13;
demonstration schools would be home to action research activities; (ii) 300 schools would receive&#13;
small grants given on a competitive basis for teacher-designed approaches to improving teaching&#13;
and learning; and (iii) school-based in-service teacher training programs would be organized for&#13;
all teachers throughout the country (including contractual teachers and teachers in private&#13;
schools). The dissemination strategy is that the 50 demonstration schools would share results&#13;
with the 300 "small grants" schools, each of which would in turn share results with another 8-10&#13;
schools, thus reaching all of the primary schools throughout the country. These results would in&#13;
turn inform the in-service training program, giving it a solid grounding in school-based experience&#13;
and research. Each of these sub-components is described briefly below. Their implementation&#13;
would be coordinated by the DIFOP and in collaboration with the DEPD.&#13;
3.16  Action research schools. A series of school-based "action research" projects would be&#13;
developed at 50 primary schools located in each of Togo's five geographic regions. Schools&#13;
would be chosen based on both the presence of innovative personnel and the existence of&#13;
promising local practices. To the extent possible, experimentation would build on local practices.&#13;
Examples of innovations to be considered include decentralized teacher supervision and&#13;
management systems, leading to a restructured role for school directors and inspectors, as well as&#13;
an increased role of communities in school management.&#13;
3.17  Schools hosting "action research" programs would be provided with resources such as&#13;
books and materials that could be replicated on a wider scale in the near term. The emphasis&#13;
would be on experimenting with pedagogical practices at the school level that do not imply an&#13;
important increase in recurrent spending. Improvements in the quality of learning and the&#13;
performance of individual schools would be measurable in terms of exam success rates and lower&#13;
repetition and drop-out rates. The process of pilot school identification and survey design would&#13;
provide a vehicle for consensus and capacity building in terms of how to go about improving the&#13;
way schools operate. The Quality School subcommittee (of the overall Steering Committee)&#13;
would be responsible for selecting and orienting school survey/research teams. The larger "action&#13;
research" projects would be selected through a competitive bidding process, in which public,&#13;
quasi-public (including the university and NGOs) and private research-oriented institutions would&#13;
be invited to submit survey proposals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                  14&#13;
3.18 Small Grants Schools. Approximately 300 small grants would be given on a competitive&#13;
basis to individual schools or school clusters for improving teaching and learning. The small&#13;
grants to individual schools or school clusters would be given on the basis of proposals prepared&#13;
by the school teachers and directors themselves. This initiative would help the MENRS to ensure&#13;
stakeholder participation in designing a program of qualitative innovations and reform at the&#13;
classroom level. The emphasis would be on practices having a direct impact on improving&#13;
teaching and learning systems, highlighting three aspects in particular: (a) problem-solving&#13;
approaches to teaching, (b) instructional management, and (c) the relationship between the school&#13;
curriculum and the school context. Systematic supervision of the "action research" projects to be&#13;
developed under this program would constitute a capacity-building mechanism within the&#13;
ministry. This component would also help ministry personnel to establish and monitor&#13;
performance indicators and to develop and refine school management and spending norms. It&#13;
would permit central and mid-level ministry personnel to benefit from stakeholder feedback on&#13;
policies, strategies, and programs.&#13;
3.19  In-service Teacher Training. There is an existing curriculum for in-service training&#13;
which was used by MENRS in the past when sufficient resources were available for this purpose.&#13;
This curriculum focused heavily on the appropriate use of textbooks and teaching materials.&#13;
During the first year of training under this project, the in-service teacher training program would&#13;
be reactivated. It would initially be designed to deal almost exclusively with helping teachers&#13;
modify their teaching strategies in the light of the new textbooks to be made available. The&#13;
lessons from the action research and small grants programs would be incorporated into the in-&#13;
service teacher training program by the third year of implementation. Schools hosting action&#13;
research programs would be expected to evolve into demonstration schools to be used for in-&#13;
service training.&#13;
3.20  The survey/research process would give the Steering Committee, as well as IDA and other&#13;
donors, the opportunity to evaluate the capacity of the survey teams and to provide constructive&#13;
feedback where needed. The number of schools involved in the program would expand depending&#13;
on local capacity, resource availability, and results obtained. The Steering Committee would be&#13;
responsible for ensuring that all activities (survey team selection, school selection, survey design&#13;
preparation and survey implementation) are coordinated with the relevant regional and district-&#13;
level authorities. In particular, inspectors in the chosen prefectures would work closely with the&#13;
survey teams. Satellite school arrangements and instructional supervision guidelines for school&#13;
principals would be tested through the network of schools participating in the Quality Schools In-&#13;
Service Training. The Quality Schools In-Service Training would also help the Government&#13;
monitor expenditures within the framework of the education budget for routine teacher training&#13;
and supervision. It would also evaluate the impact of training on teaching quality and student&#13;
learning outcomes. Annex VII further describes this component.&#13;
3.21  The project would include: (a) 50 action-research programs; (b) 300 small grants in&#13;
schools and school clusters; (c) in-service teacher training seminars and workshops; (d) short-&#13;
term technical assistance to guide and evaluate the progress of the pilot school program; and (e)&#13;
office equipment, a vehicle, and incremental operating costs for project start-up.&#13;

2. Develop Better Education System Management&#13;
3.22  The process of preparing operating and investment budgets in the MENRS tends to be&#13;
driven by ad hoc administrative concerns rather than functional priorities. MENRS staff have also&#13;
been unable to define and articulate standard operating norms and spending priorities that would&#13;
allow them to project the implications of various actions and spending options for decision makers&#13;
either within the MENRS or in the central ministries (Finance, Planning, and Public Service).&#13;
Once budgets are accorded to the MENRS by the Ministry of Finance, little emphasis or&#13;
importance is placed on systematically monitoring and analyzing actual expenditures in the&#13;
context of past budgets or on using these figures during the preparation of future budgets. Given&#13;
the lack of technical justification for budget proposals and spending priorities, it is not surprising&#13;
that the MENRS currently plays only a limited role during the budget arbitration process.&#13;
3.23  The limited amount of attention given to budget functions within the ministry jeopardizes&#13;
the Government's policy commitment to increasingly decentralize personnel management and&#13;
funding for school maintenance and construction. This commitment requires that appropriate&#13;
budget, information, and commnunication tools be available at the regional, prefectoral, and school&#13;
levels for successful implementation.&#13;
3.24  A greatly enhanced school mapping capacity is needed for informed decision-making in&#13;
response to both emergency and long-term funding needs. The current project would strengthen&#13;
the capacity of the ministry to generate and analyze data regarding personnel, school facilities,&#13;
equipment, and furnishings. This would include data about population trends and coverage as a&#13;
basis for prioritizing teacher and administrative staff allocation and new school construction, as&#13;
well as data about school furnishings, and ongoing maintenance and rehabilitation needs.&#13;
(a) Decentralized Recruitment and Financing of Teachers Component (base cost&#13;
US$14.1 million equivalent)&#13;
3.25  Objectives and Scope. With support from the project, the Government seeks to provide&#13;
a stable environment for teaching and learning over the next five years as the economy recovers.&#13;
In line with its education sector development strategy, the Government plans to build on the few&#13;
positive features of the current auxiliary teacher situation (decentralized control, community&#13;
participation) in order to develop a more stable, region-based approach for hiring and supervising&#13;
auxiliary teachers. This is an important step towards broader education sector reforms which will&#13;
support macroeconomic and civil service reforms. It is also an essential step for ensuring the&#13;
presence of teachers in classrooms, improving teachers' productivity and morale, and for&#13;
reversing declining enrollment trends. With the, support of the project, consultative regional&#13;
school boards and a region-based Education Support Fund would be established. Regional non-&#13;
civil service teaching bodies would progressively be put in place under the authority of these&#13;
boards along with a gradual reduction in the number of civil service teachers. This approach&#13;
presents the potential for a significant reduction in unit salary costs and a corresponding&#13;
opportunity for increasing the number of teachers in place and for reallocating the sectoral budget&#13;
in favor of much needed non-salary operating expenditures. The estimated number of auxiliary&#13;
primary school teachers whose situation (status and financing) would be stabilized over the five&#13;
years of the project is provided below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                     16&#13;
Audiliara Primary School Teachers&#13;
Project Year 1                3,750&#13;
Project Year 2                4,000&#13;
Project Year 3                4,250&#13;
Project Year 4                4,250&#13;
Project Year 5                4,250&#13;
3.26 Under the project, additional financing for teachers' salaries would be mobilized. Initially,&#13;
resources will pass through budgetary accounts, but when the Education Support Fund has been&#13;
established under the project, resources will pass through it. The following resources will be&#13;
mobilized: (i) Government budgetary allocations, constituting counterpart funding to the project,&#13;
would be increased in line with savings from attrition in the civil service (teacher) wage bill; (ii)&#13;
community and parent contributions resulting from school fees and other community sources to&#13;
be identified. As these resources are insufficient to meet the full cost of auxiliary teachers'&#13;
salaries in the early years of the project, IDA would finance part of the incremental cost for&#13;
primary auxiliary teachers on a declining basis (declining from 80 percent to 40 percent).&#13;
3.27  In addition to auxiliary primary teacher salaries, the project would finance activities&#13;
designed to develop institutional capacity including: (a) support for the establishment of&#13;
consultative regional boards that would eventually exercise oversight responsibility for teacher&#13;
recruitment; (b) development of a financing mechanism (Education Support Fund) to ensure&#13;
regular payment of all auxiliary primary school teachers with resources collected from the parents,&#13;
contributions by local governments, and payments from the central Government and donors,&#13;
including IDA; (c) development and testing of proper accounting and audit procedures at the local&#13;
level; (d) a functional audit of all teachers and administrators paid through the civil service&#13;
(Ministry of Finance and MENRS figures differ widely, with many of those classified as teachers&#13;
apparently working outside the education sector); and (e) other studies to explore longer-term&#13;
approaches to decentralized personnel recruitment, management, and funding, including the&#13;
institutionalization of the region-based Education Support Fund.&#13;
3.28   The Government has submitted (a) budget targets for 1995-2000 and a financing plan for&#13;
auxiliary teachers' salaries (primary, lower and upper secondary levels) and (b) three studies of&#13;
decentralized teacher financing and payment. Agreement has been reached on the financing plan&#13;
and actions. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it will redeploy&#13;
teaching personnel at the secondary school level in accordance with the objectives and timetable&#13;
set forth in the Government' s strategy in the education sector laid out in the Letter of Education&#13;
Sector Policy, with the goal of increasing the efficiency of teacher use and ensuring that secondary&#13;
teachers are responsible, on average, for approximately 21 hours of teaching each week.&#13;
Government proposes to eliminate the present transfer of 40 percent of school fees to central&#13;
MENRS activities, and to provide for these funds to be a source of local counterpart financing for&#13;
auxiliary teachers. Follow-up activities and longer-terni approaches to overall teacher financing&#13;
would be agreed at the time of the mid-term project review.&#13;
3.29  The project would provide for: (a) incremental auxiliary primary school teacher salaries on&#13;
a declining basis; (b) technical assistance to establish regional school boards and develop criteria&#13;
for decentralized personnel management and financing, including the establishment of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                    17&#13;
decentralized Education Support Fund; (c) design of financial and auditing procedures for&#13;
decentralized payment of auxiliary teachers; (d) ongoing studies, including a functional audit of&#13;
MENRS personnel as a first step in teacher redeployment and an evaluation of the participation of&#13;
regional school boards in management decisions; (e) training of financial managers; (f) regional&#13;
and central level audits; and (g) operating expenditures of the regional school boards.&#13;
(b) Information and Communication Systems Component (base cost US$0.8&#13;
million equivalent)&#13;
3.30  Objectives and Scope. A computer systems support unit would be created within the&#13;
MENRS to provide support for information needs within the school statistics, school mapping&#13;
and personnel units. Training would be provided for personnel in these units. It is expected that&#13;
this exercise would result in the availability and use of personnel data sheets and school maps at&#13;
the inspectorate, regional, and national levels. Personnel data sheets would provide information&#13;
on teacher qualifications and experience, as well as on placement and utilization. School maps&#13;
would provide details on the school-aged population for each inspectorate--with projections&#13;
through the end of the decade--number and condition of classrooms, availability of textbooks and&#13;
other teaching materials, enrollment figures, catchmnent areas, shortage (or excess) of student&#13;
places and shortage (or excess) of teachers. This would also serve as the basis for developing a&#13;
program to evaluate the appropriateness of teacher qualifications. For secondary schools, the&#13;
information system would provide data about teaching loads per subject as a part of the&#13;
redeployment exercise. It would also provide information regarding projected rates of transition&#13;
to university. Overall, this exercise would result in a viable data base at the inspectorate level for&#13;
use in determining construction and maintenance priorities, for making decisions regarding&#13;
teacher deployment, and for informing the policy-making process.&#13;
3.31   Terms of reference for consultants which emphasize training objectives and technology&#13;
transfer, and a general scope of work have been prepared. These documents provide for&#13;
establishment of working groups and define working relationships between the Planning and&#13;
Financial Affairs directorates, regional offices of the MENRS, and the inspectorates. These&#13;
directorates would receive assistance in coordinating their work programs with efforts undertaken&#13;
in the context of the Quality Schools Initiative, the Budgetary Programming and the Ministerial&#13;
Restructuring components of the project.&#13;
3.32  Terms of reference describe in detail the technology transfer objectives of the technical&#13;
support and define criteria for evaluating the success of capacity transfer. They would also&#13;
include a technical profile which places emphasis on team building and training skills. The&#13;
MENRS directors would be accountable for the implementation of the planned training program&#13;
within their own directorate, and would receive individual progress reports.&#13;
3.33   The project would provide: (a) 36 man-months of short-term technical assistance to assist&#13;
ministry personnel in drafting work programs and to provide technical training in the area of&#13;
computerized information system management; (b) regional training workshops; (c) computers,&#13;
office equipment, supplies, and a vehicle to support the operations of the statistics and school&#13;
mapping units; and (d) general operating costs, including mission travel allowances.&#13;

(c) Budgetary Programming and Monitoring Component (base cost US$0.4&#13;
million equivalent)&#13;
3.34  Objectives and Scope.  The objective of the project in the area of budgetary&#13;
programming and monitoring would be to strengthen the capacity of the MENRS to participate&#13;
constructively in the budget arbitration process. Support would be provided to strengthen the&#13;
capacity of staff to: (a) analyze current spending patterns--for both operating and investment&#13;
resources--aimed at identifying efficiency gains; (b) prepare and defend operating and investment&#13;
budgets on the basis of clear and coherent spending priorities and standard operating norms; and&#13;
(c) monitor and analyze actual expenditures against budgetary allocations in the context of future&#13;
budget preparation. In addition to their analytic value, the budgetary tools developed under the&#13;
project should be viewed as vehicles for legitimating change in terms of new sector priorities. The&#13;
component would be considered a success if, at the end of implementation, MENRS staff were&#13;
able to use new tools and work methods to articulate their ministry's needs and demonstrate the&#13;
budgetary implications of decision making.&#13;
3.35  Expenditure authority in Togo is, to a large extent, outside the purview of the technical&#13;
ministries. Salaries, fellowships and other transfers that constitute in excess of 90 percent of&#13;
human resource expenditures are all beyond the purview of technical ministries. Hence,&#13;
monitoring the execution of budgets will entail two separate tasks. First, working groups within&#13;
the MENRS would establish formal procedures for information flows between the central&#13;
ministries (Finance, Planning, and Civil Service) and the relevant MENRS departments. The&#13;
objective would be that information on budget execution for all expenditure categories be made&#13;
available to decision makers on a quarterly basis. Second, training would be provided to MENRS&#13;
staff at all levels to: (i) improve its capacity to provide timely feedback to decision makers&#13;
throughout a given budget year regarding budget execution; (ii) analyze executed budget&#13;
information in relation to preparing future budgets; and (iii) monitor and analyze operating&#13;
expenditures over which the technical ministries have direct control, ensuring that fanding be&#13;
available in a timely fashion.&#13;
3.36  The project would provide for: (a) seminars and field surveys aimed at (i) preparing&#13;
budgetary programming models; and (ii) establishing standard operating procedures and&#13;
reorganizing inter-departmental and inter-ministerial communications and information flow&#13;
patterns; (b) training of regional and prefecture staff on the use of basic budget models, with&#13;
feedback from users; (c) computers and office equipment and supplies; (d) short-term technical&#13;
assistance as needed through the medium of working groups and training seminars; and (e)&#13;
incremental operating costs.&#13;
(d) Consolidation of the Ministerial Restructuring Component (base cost US$1.6&#13;
million equivalent)&#13;
3.37  Objectives and Scope.  In 1992, the MENRS developed plans to consolidate a&#13;
restructuring plan. The aim of this plan was to focus decision-making and resource allocation&#13;
around teaching and learning processes. This meant placing greater control and decision-making&#13;
power closer to the school level through region-based decentralization, with a view to managing&#13;
scarce resources in a manner consistent with national development priorities. Emphasis was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                   19&#13;
placed on exploiting new sources of information about the education system, establishing new&#13;
information flow procedures both laterally and horizontally within the ministry, and improving the&#13;
work methods and practices of ministerial staff at all levels. To date, this plan has been only&#13;
partially implemented due to the disruptions of the last two years.&#13;
3.38  The project would finance medium-term  technical assistance to help the MENRS&#13;
consolidate the gains from its restructuring in terms of defining specific priorities and objectives&#13;
for each operational unit, establishing position descriptions and work programs for all personnel,&#13;
and creating operating and information flow procedures. Special attention would be given to&#13;
functions which directly support the teaching and learning process. To this end, training would be&#13;
provided to help inspectors and pedagogic counselors develop a new role in support of the&#13;
instructional leadership function of school directors. Training seminars would be held for all&#13;
school directors to help them understand this new role and provide feedback about the most&#13;
appropriate ways in which it can be strengthened. Information gathered in the context of the&#13;
Quality Schools Initiative and the information systems component would be integrated into this&#13;
process.&#13;
3.39  With regards to the General Directorate of Educational Planning and the other MENRS&#13;
departments, the current project would, through budget targets and annual budget reviews, ensure&#13;
a more rational allocation of resources in response to priority needs. Individual components of&#13;
the project would be managed by the various operational directorates (primary education, lower-&#13;
secondary education, etc.) as appropriate under the general supervision of a new management&#13;
entity, the MENRS Steering Committee.&#13;
3.40  The MENRS Steering Committee was established to oversee and support implementation&#13;
of the Education Rehabilitation Project, but it has already evolved into a role as the cornerstone of&#13;
the ministry's efforts to consolidate its proposed restructuring. For the first time, this committee&#13;
brings together key departmental directors as a decision-making body, laying the foundation for&#13;
development of real management capacity and functions, including meaningful delegation of&#13;
responsibility within the context of a coherent policy framework. The Steering Committee has&#13;
been meeting regularly throughout the project preparation process, and collaborated primarily&#13;
with the Ministries of Plan and Finance to develop a Letter of Education Sector Policy. The&#13;
Steering Committee would coordinate the move within the sector toward decentralization,&#13;
including the establishment of a decentralized Education Support Fund. All terms of reference&#13;
developed under this project emphasize the need to provide the Steering Committee with timely&#13;
feedback on implementation, as well as the need to communicate the project's objectives and the&#13;
strategy defined to achieve those objectives to all staff of the MENRS.&#13;
3.41  Based on the above process of ministerial restructuring, as well as the initial findings of the&#13;
Quality Schools Initiative, the project would provide for: (a) periodic yearly training seminars for&#13;
all school directors, pedagogic counselors, inspectors, and teacher trainers; approximately 3,500&#13;
staff would be trained under the component; (b) training of the Examinations Directorate staff to&#13;
provide it with broader test construction skills, and to expand its role to include feedback to&#13;
teachers and directors about student learning at all levels; this would require development of&#13;
sampling capacity; (c) short-term technical assistance, including training specialists to assist the&#13;
relevant units to define training programs; (d) computers, office equipment and vehicles; (e) travel&#13;
&#13;

expenses for participants in the training programs and (f) a limited number of study visits to allow&#13;
the Togolese responsible for program design to benefit from similar experiences in neighboring&#13;
countries.&#13;
C. Project Costs and Financing&#13;
3.42  The project's estimated total cost over a five-year period is US$46.6 million (including&#13;
taxes and duties), with a foreign exchange component of US$15.9 million (35 percent). Base&#13;
costs are estimated at US$42.4 million (90 percent) and contingencies at US$4.2 million (10&#13;
percent of base costs). The project would be financed by an IDA Credit of US$36.6 million&#13;
equivalent, representing 80 percent of total project costs, net of taxes and duties.  The&#13;
Government's contribution is estimated at US$5.9 million equivalent (13 percent) of which&#13;
US$0.8 million equivalent represent taxes and duties. The communities' contribution is estimated&#13;
at US$4.1 million equivalent (9 percent). Physical contingencies were estimated at 10 percent for&#13;
goods and works. Price contingencies for foreign costs were estimated at 2.6 percent. Price&#13;
contingencies for local expenditures were estimated at 10 percent and 7 percent for 1996 and&#13;
1997, respectively, and 5.0 percent for the period 1998 to 2001. A detailed breakdown of costs is&#13;
presented in Annex VIII. Tables 3.1 and 3.2 summarize the project costs by components and the&#13;
financing plan by expenditure category.&#13;

3.43  Recurrent cost implications. The major recurrent cost associated with the project will&#13;
be auxiliary teachers' salaries.  As explained in paragraphs 3.25-3.29, the project makes&#13;
comprehensive arrangements to ensure the availability of stable sources of financing for salaries&#13;
compatible with Government's overall resource outlook. Other recurrent costs generated by&#13;
project investments have three implications.  The first recurrent cost implication of project&#13;
investments is the appropriate maintenance of textbook supplies. While IDA would finance the&#13;
initial stocks of textbooks for lower secondary schools, there would be recurrent costs associated&#13;
with maintaining a 1:2 textbook/student ratio over the life of the project, an estimated amount of&#13;
CFAF 746 million (US$1.4 million equivalent) over five years. This amount would be provided&#13;
for partly through textbook rentals and communities' contribution towards the textbook&#13;
replacement and renewal. Government would also provide a separate budget line for renewal of&#13;
primary textbooks, and would include this cost in its annual budget provisions. The second&#13;
recurrent cost implication relates to the continued support for implementing the pedagogical&#13;
practices developed under the Quality Schools Initiative that provide for better and more&#13;
effective schools. These innovations support the development of mechanisms for building the&#13;
capacity of school-level actors to organize and manage school programs effectively, thus&#13;
developing a better sense of ownership and commitment to school quality and efficiency. This, in&#13;
turn, would result in improved student learning and overall increases in efficiency. The initial cost&#13;
of these activities will be financed by the project, then their sustainability would require further&#13;
support from the Government and school resources. The third recurrent cost implication relates&#13;
to the cost of upkeep and maintenance of school infrastructure.  The cost for regularly&#13;
maintaining the classrooms replaced and rehabilitated under the project is estimated at CFAF 45.0&#13;
million over five years; which would be shared by communities through labor contribution as well&#13;
as Government through the provision of materials.&#13;

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
4.1   The project was prepared with a PPF advance. Activities carried out to support project&#13;
preparation included: (a) a survey of best practices linked to the Quality Schools Initiatives&#13;
component to strengthen school-level instructional management; (b) a program to restructure the&#13;
Ministry of Education; (c) identification of activities to be undertaken to develop a school&#13;
mapping capacity; (d) studies on the management of the proposed decentralized Education&#13;
Support Fund; (e) a mission to select school sites for rehabilitation and construction and&#13;
completion of a cahier des charges to this effect; (f) production of two statistical yearbooks&#13;
(1992 and 1993); (g) preparation of an implementation manual; (h) seminars for the textbook and&#13;
school quality initiatives; and (i) training of ministry personnel in the use of a budget model for&#13;
budget preparation and monitoring.&#13;
4.2   During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will adopt an action plan with&#13;
a timetable, satisfactory to IDA, not later than March 31, 1996, describing a program of actions&#13;
and measures necessary to the creating of a decentralized Education Support Fund and implement&#13;
promptly the action plan. The adoption of a Project Implementation Manual, satisfactory to IDA,&#13;
outlining the procurement, disbursement and other implementation arrangements for the project,&#13;
including the operational guidelines for textbook loan and maintenance at the primary school level&#13;
and for textbook rental and replacement at the lower-secondary school level, and signed contracts&#13;
for the consultants whose services are required during the first twelve months after the Effective&#13;
Date are conditions of effectiveness.&#13;
B. Project Coordination and Management&#13;
4.3   Within MENRS the Steering Committee described in paras. 2.26 and 2.27 would have&#13;
responsibility for monitoring project implementation and for providing feedback and support to&#13;
responsible MENRS staff to facilitate timely project implementation. In addition, an&#13;
interministerial committee is charged  with the broader dialogue regarding the links between&#13;
education and economic development. The primary mandate of the Steering Committee would be&#13;
problem solving; its role is to act quickly and effectively to facilitate project implementation and&#13;
ensure that problems are discussed and addressed in a timely manner. It is also responsible for&#13;
monitoring and evaluating the transfer of technical capacity from the advisors provided under the&#13;
project to the staff of the MENRS.  The Committee, which was created during project&#13;
preparation, is chaired by the Minister and includes the Secretary-General, the Director-General&#13;
of Planning, the Directors of Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Schooling, the Director of&#13;
Examinations, the Director-General of Administration and Finance, the Permanent Secretary of&#13;
the Higher Council on Education, and the project coordinator.&#13;
4.4   IDA-specific implementation matters, such as procurement, disbursements and project&#13;
accounting, would be handled by the Division for Financial Affairs (DAF) of the DGPE, under the&#13;
general supervision of the project coordinator. The DAF would benefit from computer upgrades&#13;
in order to use budgetary management software. The DAF personnel would receive training in&#13;
the use of this software prior to project effectiveness. The DAF is adequately staffed and an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                  23&#13;
accountant has been appointed to provide assistance in the setting up of proper accounts and&#13;
training, where needed, to ensure the efficient management of the accounts. Line agencies with&#13;
responsibility for project component implementation are shown in Annex IX.&#13;
C. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.5   The monitoring and evaluation of program performance, including investments and&#13;
policies, would be carried out by the implementing units of the MENRS over the life of the&#13;
project, with the Steering Committee playing a coordinating role. The supervision process would&#13;
include representation of all stakeholders involved in the sector as well as beneficiary assessments.&#13;
During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that the Steering Committee, in its project&#13;
coordination role, will meet the following requirements: (a) undertake with IDA not later than&#13;
November 30, 1996 and, thereafter, not later than November 30 of each subsequent year, a joint&#13;
annual review of the project to exchange views generally on the progress achieved in the carrying&#13;
out of the project and on the performance by the Borrower, in particular: (i) the status of&#13;
disbursement and procurement performance under the project; (ii) progress in the execution and&#13;
management of the civil works; (iii) the effectiveness of technical assistance, the implementation&#13;
of training activities and the performance of trained staff, (iv) the establishment of processes to&#13;
improve student learning and teaching; (v) the textbook procurement and distribution system, and&#13;
the textbook maintenance system; (vi) annual work program; and (vii) reporting, accounting, and&#13;
auditing performance; (b) prepare and submit to IDA, not later than four weeks before the&#13;
scheduled date of the annual reviews, a report of project activities of such scope and in such detail&#13;
as IDA may request; and (c) prepare and furnish to IDA not later than six months after the&#13;
Closing Date a plan for the future operation of the project. Key monitoring indicators based on&#13;
the Government's program are detailed in Annex X. Training strategies to be implemented under&#13;
the project are described in Annex V. The details of IDA's supervision plan, including the annual&#13;
and mid-term reviews, are provided in Annex XI.&#13;
D. Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.6  The project would be implemented over a five-year period (1995-2000), with the IDA&#13;
Credit disbursed correspondingly. The implementation period has been selected to respond to the&#13;
immediate needs to halt further degradation of the sector, while at the same time prioritizing&#13;
areas of intervention commensurate with the existing capacity in the country. This is consistent&#13;
with the approach in education sector development agreed between Government and IDA. The&#13;
proposed project is designed to jump-start the sector by ensuring availability of teachers,&#13;
teaching materials, and classrooms and by strengthening institutional capacity conducive to&#13;
longer-term reform. The framework for implementing project activities and the basis for planning&#13;
the physical aspects of project implementation are provided in Annex XII.&#13;
E. Procurement&#13;
4.7   Procurement under the project would cover the cost of (i) civil works (US$8.1 million) for&#13;
the construction/rehabilitation of primary school classrooms and book storage facilities; (ii)&#13;
contracts for textbooks and teachers' guides for primary and lower secondary schools (US$14.9&#13;
million) and equipment and vehicles for the use of the implementing agency (US$0.8 million); and&#13;
&#13;

(iii) consultant services, including project management and training (US$7.6 million). The project&#13;
elements, estimated costs and proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.1&#13;
below. All contracts to be financed by IDA would follow procedures in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's procurement Guidelines under IDA Credits and, in the case of consultant services, with&#13;
the Bank Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers. Standard documents&#13;
would be used throughout the project. ICB procurement would be based on Bank standard bid&#13;
documents and NCB procurement on simplified standard bid documents subject to previous Bank'&#13;
mandatory review.&#13;

4.8     Procurement of Works.  The civil works program  totaling the aggregate amount of&#13;
US$8.1 million equivalent includes the construction of 360 classrooms, the rehabilitation of 440&#13;
classrooms, and the construction of book storage facilities. Given the small size and scattered&#13;
nature of the construction and rehabilitation works (mostly located in remote areas), the contracts&#13;
would be of little interest to foreign contractors and would therefore be procured under the NCB&#13;
method of procurement. In addition, local contractors with the involvement of communities, have&#13;
the capacity to carry out the works. Foreign contractors would not be precluded from bidding in&#13;
NCB. The maximum amount per contract is expected to be less than $200,000. Bidding&#13;
documents for works would be prepared using the Bank's standard bidding document for works&#13;
which would be submitted to IDA for review and approval. Local procedures are based on a&#13;

include local advertising, public bid opening, clearly defined evaluation criteria, non-exclusion of&#13;
foreign bidders and no preference to domestic contractors. A supplementary letter to record&#13;
waivers was discussed and agreed during negotiations.&#13;
4.9   Procurement of Goods. Procurement of goods would be carried out as follows:&#13;
(a)   Textbooks Provision and Delivery: Procurement of primary and lower secondary&#13;
school textbooks and teachers'guides and delivery of primary textbooks by the suppliers for an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$10.8 million equivalent, would be carried out by International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance to Bank procurement Guidelines. Bank&#13;
standard bidding documents for the procurement of textbooks would be used throughout.&#13;
Bidders would be allowed to bid for one or more packages.  Concerning the reprinting of the&#13;
French and Mathematics titles for primary level textbooks and teachers' guides, the Government&#13;
would make arrangements with the original publishers to allow for the reprinting of these titles&#13;
through ICB since the copyrights were granted, under the Educational Improvement Project&#13;
(Cr. 1568-TO), to private publishers until year 1999 for French and 2000 for Mathematics titles.&#13;
The Sciences books would be purchased through ICB. Delivery of primary schools textbooks and&#13;
teachers'guides would be integrated in the book purchase contract. For the selection of the lower&#13;
secondary textbooks and teachers'  guides Publishers would be invited through a notice&#13;
advertised internationally to submit titles. The titles selected would be divided into packages by&#13;
subject and purchased through ICB. Services for the delivery of lower secondary textbooks and&#13;
teachers' guides totaling US$12,000 equivalent would be carried out through direct contracting&#13;
by LIMUSCO/MENRS.&#13;
(b)   Vehicles and Equipment:  Procurement of vehicles, computers, and office&#13;
equipment under separate packages for an aggregate amount of US$0.8 million equivalent, would&#13;
be carried out by ICB procedures. Locally manufactured goods, if any, would receive a&#13;
preference in bid evaluation in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines (January 1995).&#13;
National shopping up to an aggregate of US$50,000, or IAPSO, up to an aggregate of&#13;
US$50,000, may be used for purchases of individual vehicles or office equipment needed for the&#13;
project.&#13;
4.10  Consultant Services. Consultants for management, architectural, procurement, auditing&#13;
and various sectoral and technical services, including training, totaling the aggregate amount of&#13;
US$7.6 million equivalent, would be procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines on the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers. Terms of reference for consultants would include process&#13;
of transfer of skills and interaction with local personnel to ensure their commitment to on-the-job&#13;
training and transfer of knowledge to nationals. A summary of technical assistance requirements&#13;
and studies to be carried out by the project is provided in Annex XII. The supervision and&#13;
follow-up of the classroom construction and rehabilitation program would be contracted to the&#13;
private sector in view of the scope of the works and in order to implement an accelerated&#13;
construction schedule. The MENRS would prepare bidding documents and handle procurement&#13;
procedures. A verification firm would conduct an a posteriori review of procurement procedures&#13;
linked to the construction and rehabilitation component, and other components as needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Education Rehabilitation Project                                                26&#13;
4.11. Miscellaneous. Consumables, auxiliary teachers salaries, supervision and local training&#13;
allowances, equipment and vehicles maintenance costs, fuel, etc. would be acquired and paid for&#13;
following regular government procedures defined in the Implementation Manual to be approved&#13;
by IDA before project effectiveness.&#13;
4.12 Procurement Management. The Directorate for Education Planning (DGPE) has&#13;
already gained considerable experience managing procurement matters under the Educational&#13;
Improvement Project. In addition to training provided under the Educational Improvement&#13;
Project, the Bank has provided further training in procurement procedures during project&#13;
preparation. The DGPE would report bid evaluations and publish all contract awards; the project&#13;
coordinator would review procurement progress in semi-annual reports to IDA. A verification&#13;
firn would conduct an a posteriori review of procurement procedures linked to the construction&#13;
and rehabilitation component, and other components as needed.&#13;
4.13  Standard processing time for the various procurement steps, in particular, bid evaluation&#13;
and contract signing, is provided in Table 4.2. It is estimated that the initial preparation of&#13;
standard NCB and Bank standard ICB bidding documents would take 8-16 weeks. Once these&#13;
standard bidding documents have been approved by the Bank, they may be used as models for&#13;
other future procurement under NCB and ICB. To this end, it is expected that time for preparing&#13;
subsequent standard bidding documents would be reduced. The Government has submitted to&#13;
IDA the draft bidding documents for all works to be procured through NCB during the first year&#13;
of the project.&#13;

4.14  Procurement Schedule. The schedule of major procurement activities is provided in the&#13;
annexed Implementation and Disbursement Schedule (Annexes XII and XLII). As a condition&#13;
of effectiveness, the Government will submit bidding documents, acceptable to IDA, for the&#13;
goods scheduled to be procured during the first twelve months after the Effective Date.&#13;
4.15  Review by IDA. IDA-financed contracts for works and goods above a threshold of&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent would be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. The review process&#13;
would cover about 80 percent of the total value procured by ICB and NCB (100 percent ICB;&#13;
about 50 percent NCB). Selective post-review of awarded contracts below the threshold levels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                27&#13;
would apply to about one out of three contracts. Draft standard bidding documents for NCB&#13;
would be reviewed by and agreed upon with IDA. All contracts for consultant and training&#13;
services estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or more with firm(s) selected&#13;
competitively and the equivalent of US$50,000 or more with individual consultants, would&#13;
require prior review by IDA. All terms of reference and all single-source contracts regardless of&#13;
the value would be subject to prior review by IDA.&#13;
F. Disbursements&#13;
4.16  The project is expected to be completed over a five year period, with the IDA Credit&#13;
disbursed over six years by June 30, 2001, according to the Categories shown in Table 4.3. The&#13;
estimated project disbursement profiles are shown in Annex Xm.&#13;
4.17  Special Account. To facilitate disbursements of eligible expenditures for works, goods&#13;
and services, the Government would open a Special Account in a commercial bank to cover part&#13;
of IDA's share of eligible expenditures to be managed and administered by the DAF of the DGPE.&#13;
The authorized allocation for the Special Account would be US$500,000.; IDA would make an&#13;
initial deposit of 50 percent of that amount from the proposed credit immediately upon credit&#13;
effectiveness and the remaining balance will be made available when the project implementation&#13;
has fully taken off. Replenishment applications would be submitted monthly and would be fully&#13;
documented except for contracts of US$100,000 equivalent for civil works, goods and services&#13;
(consultant firms) and US$50,000 for individual consultants which can be reimbursed on the basis&#13;
of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Replenishment applications would be accompanied by&#13;
bank statements and reconciliation statements. All documentation for SOEs would be retained for&#13;
review by visiting supervision missions or the external auditors. Withdrawal applications would be&#13;
prepared by DAC. All payments below US$50,000 equivalent must be made from the Special&#13;
Account. Payments above this threshold may be made by direct payments or special commitments.&#13;
4.18  Project Account. The Government will establish a Project Account in a commercial bank&#13;
for local matching funds. All local matching funds and most IDA eligible expenditures paid in&#13;
local currency would be disbursed from the Project Account. Any advances to project entities will&#13;
be from the Project Account. IDA eligible expenditures disbursed in local currency from the&#13;
Project Account would be replenished from the Special Account as required. During negotiations&#13;
the Government gave assurances that it will deposit into the Project Account promptly before&#13;
each calendar quarter starting after the Effective Date, sufficient funds to pay the Borrower's&#13;
contribution to the financing of the project required for such calendar quarter, as estimated. by the&#13;
Borrower in agreement with IDA. A condition of effectiveness would be that the Government&#13;
has opened the Project Account and has deposited the initial deposit in an amount in CFA francs&#13;
equivalent to US$250,000.&#13;
4.19  Auxiliary Teachers' Salaries. To permit the timely payment of salaries to auxiliary&#13;
teachers, the following disbursement procedures have been agreed during negotiations: (a) at first,&#13;
a withdrawal application will be submitted to the Africa Disbursement Division covering salaries&#13;
to auxiliary teachers for a three-month period. The funds will be deposited into a separate&#13;
account to be opened at a commercial bank in Lome; (b) after salaries for a period of two months&#13;
have been paid to auxiliary teachers, an external auditor, approved by IDA, will review the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                                 28&#13;
payments made against the consolidated auxiliary teacher payrolls on a nominal basis and confirm&#13;
that all payments made were eligible under the project; and (c) the DAF wili prepare an&#13;
application and summary sheet for the total amount spent on auxiliary teachers salaries financed&#13;
by IDA. This submission would include the external auditor's original confirmation.&#13;

costs. Since the total anount of opeating cou to be funned is .nalL it will be disbursed at a constant proportion over a 5 year&#13;
period&#13;
G. Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting&#13;
4.20   Auditing.  The DAF of the DGPE would maintain accounts to record all project&#13;
expenditures, commitments and reimbursements in accordance with accepted accounting&#13;
principles. Project accounts, would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to&#13;
IDA. The audit reports would be submitted to IDA within three months following the end of each&#13;
fiscal year. The Special Account would be audited every six months. The Government would&#13;
submit to IDA annual audit reports within six months of the end of the fiscal year; and semi-&#13;
annual audit reports of the Statement of Expenses (SOEs) within three months after the end of&#13;
each audit period and separate quarterly audits for auxiliary teacher salaries. The appointment of&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to IDA, would be a condition of effectiveness. Overdue audits&#13;
would be considered grounds for suspension of disbursements under the credit.&#13;
4.21   Mid-Term  Review. A brief description of the review and criteria to be used to evaluate&#13;
the progress of each project component are set out in Annex XIV. During negotiations, the&#13;
Government gave assurances that it will: (i) organize a joint mid-term review, not later than 30&#13;
months after the Effective Date, to exchange views generally on the progress achieved in project&#13;
implementation, and in particular on the status of disbursement and procurement performance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Education Rehabilitation Project                                                 29&#13;
under the project; and (ii) as part of the mid-term review, adopt an action plan, satisfactory to&#13;
IDA, based on and having due regard to the recommendations of the said review, and promptly&#13;
thereafter, implement such plan.&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.1   The main benefits of the proposed project would be improved education quality and&#13;
access as a result of a more adequate supply of primary school teachers, rebuilding of&#13;
infrastructure badly damaged by recent vandalism and neglect, and greater availability of&#13;
pedagogic materials at the primary and secondary school levels. The institutional capacity building&#13;
carried out under the project will be an essential step for ensuring the presence of teachers in&#13;
classrooms and for reversing declining enrollment trends. The establishment of consultative&#13;
regional school boards and a region-based Education Support Fund in parallel with regional non-&#13;
civil service teaching bodies, will present the potential for a significant reduction in unit salary&#13;
costs as well as a corresponding opportunity for increasing the number of teachers in place and&#13;
for reallocating the sectoral budget in favor of needed non-salary operating expenditures.&#13;
B. Risks and Measures to Address Them&#13;
5.2   The main risks of the project are the politically unstable environment which could&#13;
significantly increase the likelihood of implementation delays and difficulties in assuring adequate&#13;
budgetary resources to finance Government's counterpart contribution including payment of&#13;
auxiliary teachers. Other risks to achievement of project objectives are Government's capacity to&#13;
address broad institutional, finance and political issues critical to the success of the refonn&#13;
program and low sectoral capacity to oversee the Quality Schools Initiative on an ongoing basis.&#13;
The risks presented by the politically unstable environment are addressed to some extent in&#13;
project design, with an emphasis on working teams supported by coordinated short-tern&#13;
interventions of extemal expertise. Budgetary issues are addressed through up-front agreement&#13;
on budget targets that are included in Goverrnent's Letter of Education Sector Policy and that&#13;
will be monitored through a planned Public Expenditure Review, and annual budget reviews. The&#13;
Government's commitment to address institutional capacity issues has been expressed through its&#13;
Letter of Education Sector Policy which includes specific institutional reform targets; these would&#13;
be closely monitored throughout project implementation. The issue of low sectoral capacity to&#13;
oversee the Quality Schools Initiative would be addressed through the use of short-term&#13;
consultancies to provide training and research experience to Ministry and University of Benin&#13;
personnel, who would in tum provide training to inspectors and pedagogic counselors on an&#13;
ongoing basis.&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1   During negotiations, the Governent gave assurances that it will:&#13;
(a)  deposit into the Project Account, promptly before each calendar quarter starting&#13;
after the Effective Date, sufficient funds to pay the Borrower's contribution to the&#13;
financing of the project required for such calendar quarter, as estimated by the&#13;
Borrower in agreement with IDA (para. 4.18);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

alia, provisions relating to management responsibilities, reporting and audit&#13;
requirements (para. 3.12);&#13;
(e)  undertake with IDA not later than November 30, 1996 and, thereafter, not later than&#13;
November 30 of each subsequent year, a joint annual review of the project (or, as&#13;
the case may be, not later than 30 months after the Effective Date, a mid-term&#13;
review), to exchange views generally on the progress achieved in the carrying out of&#13;
the project and on the performance by the Borrower, in particular: (i) the status of&#13;
disbursement and procurement performance under the project; (ii) progress in the&#13;
execution and management of the civil works; (iii) the effectiveness of the technical&#13;
assistance, the implementation of training activities and the performance of trained&#13;
staff, (iv) the establishment of processes to improve student learning and teaching;&#13;
(v) the textbook procurement and distribution system, and the textbook maintenance&#13;
system; (vi) annual work program; and (vii) reporting, accounting, and auditing&#13;
performance (paras. 4.5 (a) and 4.21);&#13;
(f)  prepare and submit to IDA, not later than four weeks before the scheduled date of&#13;
the annual reviews, a report of project activities of such scope and in such detail as&#13;
IDA may request (para. 4.5 (b));&#13;
(g)  as part of the mid-term review, adopt an action plan, satisfactory to IDA, based on&#13;
and having due regard to the recommendations of the said review, and promptly&#13;
thereafter, implement such plan (para. 4.21); and&#13;
(h)  adopt an action plan with a timetable, satisfactory to IDA, not later than March 31,&#13;
1996, describing a program of actions and measures necessary to the creating of a&#13;
decentralized Education Support Fund and implement promptly the action plan&#13;
(para. 4.2).&#13;
&#13;

Education Rehabilitation Project                                                 31&#13;
6.2.  As conditions of effectiveness, the Government will have:&#13;
(a)  adopted a Project Implementation Manual, satisfactory to IDA, outlining the&#13;
procurement, disbursement and other implementation arrangements for the project&#13;
including the operational guidelines for textbook loan and maintenance at the&#13;
primary school level and for textbook rental and replacement at the lower-secondary&#13;
school level (para. 4.2);&#13;
(b)  employed independent auditors acceptable to IDA (para. 4.20);&#13;
(c)  prepared and furnished to IDA bidding documents, satisfactory to IDA, for the&#13;
goods scheduled to be procured during the first twelve months after the Effective&#13;
Date (para. 4.14);&#13;
(d)  employed the consultants whose services are required during the first twelve months&#13;
after the Effective Date (para. 4.2); and&#13;
(e)  opened the Project Account and has deposited therein the initial deposit in an&#13;
amount in CFA francs equivalent to US$250,000 (para. 4.18).&#13;
6.3   Recommendation. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the proposed project&#13;
would be suitable for an IDA Credit of SDR 23.3 million (US$36.6 million equivalent) to the&#13;
Republic of Togo on standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity.&#13;

c/o World Bank Resident Representative in Lome, Togo&#13;
Dear Sir:&#13;
1. Within the framework of a global development strategy consistent with its macroeconomic and&#13;
sector policy, the Togolese Government adopted an Education and Training Sector Policy&#13;
Statement on May 12, 1993. The strategy to be implemented emphasizes primary education and is&#13;
geared to improving the quality of the instruction provided.&#13;
Within the spirit of the objectives and priorities set down in its Sector Policy Statement, the&#13;
Government now transmits this updated Policy Letter reaffirming its resolve to provide the&#13;
education sector with the necessary resources to enable it to take its proper place in Togo's human&#13;
resource development process.&#13;
PRESENT SITUATION&#13;
2. Since 1975, the Togolese Government has been making major efforts within the framework of&#13;
education reform to adapt the school system to the country's current situation and to make it truly&#13;
democratic and efficient. However, given the sector's structural, organizational and financial&#13;
difficulties, it has not been possible for all of the goals of the refonn process to be attained.&#13;
In the mid-eighties, a combination of rapidly escalating school enrollments and a serious&#13;
decline in Togo's economic and financial situation plunged the education sector into a crisis that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                             ANNEX IV&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
sociopolitical circumstances of recent years have exacerbated, seriously compromising the quality&#13;
of education. The net primary enrollment rate, which was up to an acceptable level of 71 % by 1980&#13;
thanks to the reforms by then in place, has today dropped to 61.4%.&#13;
3. The Government made a significant effort to increase education financing during a period of&#13;
widespread economic crisis. In 1988-89, education financing was up to CFAF 22.2 billion from&#13;
12.5 billion in 1979-80. However, this positive trend could not be maintained because of the&#13;
economic constraints caused by the socio-economic crisis which had started in 1970. Also, the&#13;
budgetary restrictions linked to the Structural Adjustment Programs since 1982 have resulted in&#13;
reducing by 32% the part of the budget earmarked for the education sector, and allocations have&#13;
increased at a slower rate than previously and by comparison to the budget as a whole.  Also, the&#13;
school system at all levels suffered from annual cuts in the share of the budget allocated to non-&#13;
salary operating expenditures, which fell from 13% in 1978 to 6% in 1985-89 and to 1% in 1994-&#13;
95. With the serious financial difficulties of 1992-93, education expenditure fell to 18% of overall&#13;
current expenditure. The January 1994 devaluation of the CFA franc dealt the final blow to the&#13;
education system's weakened finances, pushing up the costs of school supplies and tuition fees,&#13;
despite the Government's efforts to mitigate the impact of the devaluation.&#13;
4. As a result of the reform of education policies and programs, it became possible to identify the&#13;
constraints in terms of infrastructure, human resources, and finances that were standing in the way&#13;
of steady progress toward quality education.&#13;
5. The inadequate capacity of the schools to accommodate a school-age population that is&#13;
constantly growing as demographic pressure increases is one of the factors preventing Togo's&#13;
education system from developing satisfactorily. At present, 39% of school-age children are not&#13;
attending school; they will never have a chance to do so if this situation continues. To solve this&#13;
problem, the rural communities have been setting up more and more schools on their own initiative&#13;
each year, a fact that the Government can no longer ignore.&#13;
Most of the schools are operating under highly undesirable conditions: (i) buildings that are&#13;
only half built or in serious disrepair; (ii) insufficient numbers of desks; (iii) classes with huge&#13;
numbers of students (100-150 students per class, particularly at the primary level); (iv) shortage of&#13;
teaching materials; (v) teachers with little or no training and little motivation.&#13;
6. Because of the civil service hiring freeze ordered by the Government in 1982 as a result of the&#13;
economic crisis, the Ministry of National Education and Scientific Research was unable to replace&#13;
teachers who had died or retired. At the primary school level, the impact of this hiring freeze was&#13;
felt throughout all regions of the country, but it was the rural areas that suffered the most. To cope&#13;
with the staff shortage, parents recruited substitute teachers, paying them out of their own meager&#13;
funds.  Those teachers thus received non-scale and highly variable wages.  In 1992, the&#13;
Government took over the payment of some of these auxiliary teachers, but still at wage levels far&#13;
below the civil service pay scale. Most of the auxiliaries are still poorly paid and severely lacking&#13;
in motivation. Of this group, 37% are paid by the Government under a job training program, at a&#13;
monthly rate of CFAF 25,000, while the rest are paid by parents and local communities at an&#13;
average rate varying between CFAF 5,000 and CFAF 8,000. Taking advantage of recent political&#13;
movements, the auxiliary teachers have begun to demand that their situation be regularized,&#13;
specifically through their admission into the civil service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX IV&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
But the Government is of the opinion that the admission of auxiliary teachers into the civil&#13;
service is no longer feasible, and that a new hiring policy is called for in this area.&#13;
Auxiliary teachers are also found at the lower and upper secondary levels, where the same&#13;
hiring freeze has created a problem that is less serious but similar to that being experienced at the&#13;
primary level. Auxiliary teachers account for 25% of the teaching staff in the lower and upper&#13;
secondary schools.&#13;
7. In an atmosphere of political change, when various demands are being voiced, the teachers in&#13;
this category have become aware of their importance within the system. Their number is&#13;
continually growing because of the sector's enormous demands, and today there are 4,950 such&#13;
auxiliaries (across the entire system), all of whom are demanding that their situation be regularized,&#13;
specifically through admission into the civil service, a movement that is seriously jeopardizing the&#13;
school system's normal operation.&#13;
8. These constraints are found throughout our country's education system, and are jeopardizing&#13;
both its internal and external efficiency.&#13;
As in primary education, the problems hampering operation of the system at the lower and&#13;
upper secondary levels derive from: (i) the huge numbers of students in the classrooms,&#13;
particularly in the large urban areas; (ii) the relatively few permanent teachers in relation to&#13;
auxiliaries without status (15% at the lower secondary level and 45% at the upper secondary level);&#13;
(iii) the inadequacy of teaching materials and textbooks in the schools; (iv) the lack of scientific&#13;
equipment for experiments; (v) the lack of financing for the schools set up by local communities.&#13;
At the higher education level, the University of Benin is suffering shortages in the areas of&#13;
infrastructure, teaching staff, boarding facilities and research. Suspension of bilateral cooperation&#13;
agreements has led to the departure of the expatriates and brought a halt to actions and assistance&#13;
under the heading of bilateral cooperation. The result has been the freezing of several ongoing&#13;
projects and programs. The various student groups that have come into being over the past few&#13;
years are staging strikes and other types of demonstrations to support their demands for increased&#13;
scholarships.&#13;
NEW SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
9. To cope with all these constraints, and in light of the macroeconomic objectives for 1996-97&#13;
and of its Sector Policy Statement adopted in 1993, the Government is committed to implementing&#13;
a global education and training strategy based on the following five new points: (i) improving the&#13;
internal and external efficiency of the education system, focusing in particular on primary&#13;
education; (ii) increasing intake capacity; (iii) improving human resource allocation and utilization;&#13;
(iv) strengthening the system's capacity for decentralized management through the establishment of&#13;
Regional Directorates of Education; and (v) consolidating the sector's financial position through&#13;
allocation of an appropriate level of resources.&#13;
10. The Government's sector development policy will emphasize primary education, with a net&#13;
enrollment target of 80% of the school-age population in the years 2000-2010.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                             ANNEX IV&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
To this end, the Government intends to encourage the private sector to play a more active role&#13;
in the development of primary education in general and of the pre-school level in particular, for&#13;
which support is already being received from UNICEF.&#13;
In addition, the Government will take all necessary action to encourage religious schools to&#13;
restructure and develop so that they can play a more active role in the efforts being made in this&#13;
field. The Government will continue to provide technical support to the religious and commnunity&#13;
schools to improve teacher quality and infrastructure safety, so that the agreed targets may be&#13;
attained.&#13;
IMPROVEMENT OF EFFICIENCY AND OF INTAKE CAPACITY&#13;
11. In the context of improvement of the education system's internal and external efficiency and&#13;
increasing of its intake capacity, the Government will take the necessary steps to enable each child&#13;
to successfully complete his/her primary education so that he/she will be able to function&#13;
harmoniously in the socioeconomic environment. To this end efforts will be made in each level of&#13;
education to render them more efficient.&#13;
Accordingly, at the Primary level the Government intends to allocate the necessary means to&#13;
ensure: (i) provision of textbooks at low cost to students and of teaching materials for teachers;&#13;
(ii) enhancement of the status of women by means of girls'education and training; (iii) training and&#13;
recruitment of teachers for classes currently without any; (iv) intensification of the pedagogic&#13;
supervision of teachers; (v) rehabilitation of school buildings, furnishing them with chairs, boards,&#13;
desks: and (vi) improvement of the quality of existing community schools.&#13;
For general Secondary Education, the measures to be taken will focus on: (i) improvement of&#13;
the student-teacher ratio; (ii) provision of textbooks and teaching materials; (iii) more and better&#13;
equipment for the scientific and technical education establishments; (iv) teacher training and&#13;
refresher training; and (v) setting up of an effective student and vocational orientation structure at&#13;
the school level.&#13;
At the Higher Education level, science and technology are opening up new horizons as we&#13;
move toward the twenty-first century. Togo is committed to setting up a higher education system&#13;
capable of offering training programs of quality and of a competitive level in order to provide&#13;
access to the new scientific and technological data. To this end, the Government will make a&#13;
diagnostic study of the University of Benin in order to identify the dysfunctions and bottlenecks in&#13;
the present structure and programs. The findings and conclusions of this study will open the way&#13;
for a true reform of the programs with a view to professionalizing university education so that&#13;
graduates will be better equipped and directly employable. The reform will focus essentially on the&#13;
following fields: (i) regulation of access to the different areas of higher education; (ii) diversi-&#13;
fication of higher education; (iii) development of scientific and research education infrastructures;&#13;
(iv) intensification of institutions for training upper middle level personnel (IUTs) to meet the labor&#13;
market's immediate needs; (v) establishment of a partnership between industries, the private&#13;
institutions and the University of Benin with a view to professionalization of education; and (vi)&#13;
pedagogic training of teachers.&#13;
&#13;

ADAPTATION OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM TO THE SOCIOECONOMIC&#13;
ENVIRONMENT&#13;
12. Adaptation of the education system to the socioeconomic environment is an important&#13;
component of the sector development policy, so that system graduates will be able to fit easily into&#13;
the socioeconomic environment. To accomplish this the Government conmmits itself to: (i) define&#13;
and create branches of training in accordance with the needs of the labor market; (ii) develop skills&#13;
in students aimed at fostering entrepreneurship and private enterprise; (iii) arouse awareness&#13;
arnong students and their parents regarding the needs of the priority sectors of the national&#13;
economy; (iv) channel students toward the priority sectors; and (v) intensify practical training in all&#13;
fields of education.&#13;
BETTER ALLOCATION AND UTILIZATION OF SECTOR HUMAN RESOURCES&#13;
13. Since improvement of the quality of education is subject to, among other things, availability of&#13;
sufficient teaching staff of adequate caliber, the Government will endeavor to improve the&#13;
allocation and utilization of the system's human resources in light of the country's financial position&#13;
and the need to reorganize the civil service. The actions envisaged in this connection are the&#13;
following:&#13;
14. At the primary level. To implement this policy, the Government intends to create a corps of&#13;
non-civil service auxiliary public school teachers whose particular status will be defined by&#13;
regulatory texts. This policy will make it possible to increase the numbers of teachers to cover&#13;
retirements, deaths, and such additional manpower that the sector may need in order to achieve the&#13;
80% enrollment rate projected for the period 2000-2010. These auxiliary teachers will be recruited&#13;
per post.&#13;
At the same time, and to ensure a minimum of stability within the education system (an&#13;
essential condition for ensuring the quality of education), the Government will create an auxiliary&#13;
teacher corps for personnel at all levels of the system. It will apply to the positions of teachers' aide&#13;
[moniteur], primary school teaching assistant [instituteur-adjoint], and lower and upper secondary&#13;
school teacher.&#13;
15. One of the Government's main concerns is the status of the auxiliary teachers and the financing&#13;
of teachers in general. The available budget funds for the next five years are well below what&#13;
would be needed to pay the wages of all of the auxiliary teachers. Large-scale expansion of the&#13;
system to achieve the objective of providing schooling for at least 80% of school-age children&#13;
between now and the period 2000-2010 will only be possible if the unit costs are reduced and if the&#13;
donors provide an important financial assistance.  Thus, this strategy will allow to ensure a&#13;
minimum of stability for the education system.&#13;
16. To this end, the Government responded by creating an Education Support Fund to which the&#13;
savings realized as a result of retirement or death will be paid so as to enable the sector to hire new&#13;
auxiliary teachers. These savings on the wage bill will make it possible to defray the wages of the&#13;
auxiliary teachers, according to the auxiliary teachers'status created for this purpose. The Fund will&#13;
be financed both by the sector's internal resources, particularly by a percentage of school fees,&#13;
contributions from the Parent Associations and local authorities, and budgetary resources that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42                            ANNEX IV&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
Government may mobilize either out of the general budget or in the form of contributions from our&#13;
donors and partners in development.&#13;
In the medium term it will make it possible to experiment with the establishing of increasingly&#13;
decentralized management and financing structures.&#13;
17. At the lower and upper secondary levels, the Government plans, to carry out before the end of&#13;
1996 a diagnostic study on the use of teaching staff at these two levels in order to assess the extent&#13;
to which a combination of the two levels is likely to achieve better performance. In this context,&#13;
following an assessment of the needs the teaching staff will be redeployed as soon as possible with&#13;
the aim of reducing the number of auxiliary teachers in secondary education in favor of primary&#13;
education. Moreover, the Government aims to realize efficiency gains through redeployment of&#13;
personnel at the lower and upper secondary levels, imposing a weekly minimum of 21 classroom&#13;
hours in the colleges and 18 in the lycees.&#13;
18. At the university level. The Government has already eliminated first-year scholarships in favor&#13;
of across-the-board university aid.  The diagnostic study will determine which other urgent&#13;
methods are likely to enhance sector efficiency.&#13;
19. Since the key element of any efficient education system is the quality of the teachers'training,&#13;
the Government will upgrade the professional qualifications of the teaching staff in service and will&#13;
ensure the training of pedagogic support personnel. Also, auxiliary teachers at all levels will also&#13;
be trained in teaching techniques and in action research to improve teaching quality.&#13;
An advanced training program for teachers in general will be implemented by means of training&#13;
courses and periodic refresher training in particular in specially designated training institutions.&#13;
STRENGTHENING OF THE SECTOR'S MANAGEMENT CAPACITY&#13;
20. Strengthening of management capacity is an important component of the policy envisioned by&#13;
the Government. To ensure sound functioning of the education system, achievement of this&#13;
objective calls for establishment of a good mechanism for managing human, financial and material&#13;
resources. The Government accordingly envisages a restructuring of the Ministry of Education and&#13;
Scientific Research involving decentralization of the system's management and establishment of the&#13;
Regional Directorates of Education. This restructuring will be accompanied by the following&#13;
actions: special training of the administrative personnel in the new management techniques; setting&#13;
up of an adequate mechanism for management of personnel, finances, equipment and infrastructure,&#13;
at both central and regional level; periodic organization of internal audits; organization of&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of programs/projects in execution in the system; and evaluation of sector&#13;
performance by the beneficiaries.&#13;
Implementation of a true decentralization policy can contribute to management of the education&#13;
system by enabling the territorial authorities (Region, Prefecture, Commune) and the population at&#13;
large to organize their own local development, geared to active participation by the local inhabitants&#13;
in efforts to improve the quality of education.&#13;
To this end it will be necessary to decide on the procedures for transferring capabilities to the&#13;
Regional Directorates of Education, to define new functions for those Regional Directorates, and to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43                             ANNEX IV&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
put in place and upgrade their management capacities. The long-term objective is decentralization&#13;
of management of the education system, with the establishment of a corps of regional teachers, with&#13;
decentralized management of teaching posts in the region.&#13;
However, the regional approach to the education system, i.e. that of decentralization as&#13;
necessary, should be progressive, given the scarcity of financial resources and the large volume of&#13;
human, material and financial resources this will involve. But in any case this approach can be&#13;
implemented only with the support of our development partners.&#13;
FINANCING OF THE SECTOR'S STRATEGY&#13;
21. The sector's financial position has deteriorated over recent years as a result of the combined&#13;
effects of three factors: the impact of the structural adjustment programs, the adjustment of the&#13;
exchange rate for the CFA franc, and the sociopolitical crisis.&#13;
To resolve the financial crisis besetting the sector, the Government will mobilize real and&#13;
potential local resources. This domestic effort will have to be supported by the contributions of&#13;
development partners.&#13;
22. One of the important steps undertaken by the Government in this connection is establishment of&#13;
an Education Support Fund, the resources of which will be formed by the contributions of the State,&#13;
development partners, local authorities and private sector together with those of parents through&#13;
school fees, the rate of which will be reformulated, harmonized and made generally applicable. In&#13;
addition, the savings to be gained from staff leaving the civil service on account of retirement or&#13;
death will be paid into the fund. The Fund' s resources will be used at first to pay the salaries of&#13;
auxiliary teachers.&#13;
23. The Education Support Fund will be created by Presidential Decree issued in Council of&#13;
Ministers. This decree will specify the role of the local authorities and how it is to be carried out&#13;
taking into account local conditions as well as the opinion of involved Ministries.&#13;
24 The Government will undertake efforts to increase substantially the allocations of funds to the&#13;
various education levels according to the objectives of its 1994-1997 medium-tern economic&#13;
policy. Thus, by the end of the period 1996-98 the education budget will accordingly be back at&#13;
the level of the order of 22% of the State budget it had reached in 1991. Capital expenditures in&#13;
the education and training sector will be increased during the same period. The Government for its&#13;
part undertakes to ensure that the fund is created and, further, to pursue the efforts to improve the&#13;
quality of primary and secondary education by increasing the operating budget (exclusive of&#13;
salaries), raising it to 20% of personnel expenditures during the period 1996-2001.&#13;
Yours sincerely,&#13;
Komlavi SEDDOH&#13;

REPUBLIC OF TOGO&#13;
EDUCATION REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
TRAINING AND SKILLS TRANSFER&#13;
1.    The primary objective of the Education Rehabilitation Project is to help decision makers&#13;
at all levels to improve their capacity to reform Togo's education system. The strategy adopted is&#13;
to recruit high caliber expertise with a commitment to on-the-job training and the ability to&#13;
transfer skills and knowledge to nationals. These objectives are a major focus of the consultant&#13;
terms of reference already drafted for technical advisors to be recruited under the project. To&#13;
ensure that training and skills transfer receive priority during implementation, several important&#13;
actions have been taken:&#13;
(a)   The consultant profiles developed for all technical advisor posts emphasize the&#13;
importance of training, team building and communication skills. These criteria&#13;
would be weighted heavily during the consultant selection process.&#13;
(b)   All terms of reference for consultant support outline a proposed process of&#13;
interaction between technical expert and ministerial staff. The technical advisors&#13;
would be required to interact with ministry personnel in a "working group"&#13;
format, in order to encourage participation and dissemination of information. The&#13;
technical advisors would be responsible for organizing workshops in which staff&#13;
from different ministerial offices and from outside agencies discuss their&#13;
objectives and strategies. They would also organize seminars in which ministry&#13;
staff would present the results of their work to the ministry as a whole.&#13;
(c)   All terms of reference call for the consultant to produce a work program at the&#13;
beginning of his or her assignment, to be updated annually, in which he or she&#13;
specifies training and skills transfer strategies for the coming year and a strategy&#13;
and timetable for the implementation of these objectives.&#13;
(d)   All terms of reference include criteria for evaluating the work of technical&#13;
advisors with heavy emphasis on achieving training and skills transfer objectives.&#13;
2.    Because of the emphasis placed on developing and implementing management tools and&#13;
information flow procedures and on improving work methods and practices, on-the-job training&#13;
is clearly better suited to achieving the project's capacity building objectives. Nearly all training&#13;
under the Education Rehabilitation Project would be provided on-the-job through the use of&#13;
working groups that meet regularly. Workshops and seminars would also be organized to&#13;
facilitate inter-office communication and the dissemination of information. The project would&#13;
only finance short-term technical trainers who would provide on-the-job training in the MENRS&#13;
or short-term training for precise skills in Lome.&#13;

3.    Arrangements would be made under the information systems component to train key&#13;
personnel in the use of relevant software, and to provide trouble-shooting support throughout the&#13;
project period. This training would be conducted in the context of group sessions.&#13;
4.The training aspects of this project would be considered a success if, at the end of project&#13;
implementation, ministry staff were able to use new tools, information and work methods to&#13;
articulate needs and justify decision making processes, particularly in the context of requests for&#13;
operating and investment resources.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF TOGO&#13;
EDUCATION REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
MANUELS SCOLAIRES&#13;
1.    Contexte et justification&#13;
Au Togo, les ecoles manquent de livres. La penurie est surtout aigue dans le Primaire et le&#13;
Deuxieme Degre (premier cycle du Secondaire General).&#13;
Au niveau du Primaire, le 2eme Projet Education avait finance la preparation et l'impression de&#13;
livres de francais et de calcul. Les livres ont 6te mis en vente a travers le reseau de distribution&#13;
de la Librairie des Mutuelles Scolaires (LIMUSCO) a 50% moins cher que dans les librairies&#13;
privees. Malgre cela, ils ont ete hors de la portee de la plupart des familles. Ainsi, de nombreux&#13;
e1lves, notamment ceux des zones rurales, sont restes sans livres. I1 est donc necessaire de&#13;
mettre des livres a la disposition des eleves a des conditions qui tiennent compte du faible&#13;
pouvoir d'achat de la plupart des parents.&#13;
Au niveau du Deuxieme Degre, la penurie de livres a et aggravee en novembre 1992 lorsque des&#13;
6l1ves, profitant d'une greve generale, ont emporte une grande partie des stocks. Cette situation&#13;
s'est davantage degradee en janvier 1994 lors de la devaluation du franc CFA, etant donne que la&#13;
plupart des livres utilises a ce niveau d'enseignement sont des livres importes et que leurs prix&#13;
ont, le plus souvent, doubl6. II s'avere donc imperatif de doter les colleges de manuels scolaires&#13;
et de guides pedagogiques en quantite adequate.&#13;
2.    Objectifs&#13;
Pour ameliorer la disponibilite et l'accessibilite des livres au niveau du Primaire et du Deuxieme&#13;
Degre, le projet va entreprendre les actions suivantes:&#13;
a) Pour le Primaire: Le projet va acquerir environ 2.288.000 manuels et 41.000 guides&#13;
pedagogiques en francais, en calcul et en sciences. II est attendu que ces quantites&#13;
assurent un ratio d'un livre par eleve et d'un guide par maitre, sur une periode de 5 ans.&#13;
Le projet va egalement financer une formation pour aider les Directeurs d'ecole, les&#13;
maitres et les parents a mieux proteger et conserver les livres. Le detail et les couits&#13;
estimatifs sont indiques au paragraphe 4.1 de cette annexe.&#13;
b) Pour le Deuxieme Degre: Le projet va financer un stock initial de 507.000 manuels et de&#13;
19.600 guides dans les disciplines suivantes: mathematiques, sciences physiques,&#13;
biologie, francais, anglais et geographie.  II est attendu que ce stock assure une&#13;
disponibilite d'un livre pour deux eleves a la rentree 1996/1997. Le detail et les coats&#13;
estimatifs figurent au paragraphe 4.2. Le projet va egalement financer une formation&#13;
pour aider les enseignants a mieux utiliser les livres. II va aussi financer la construction&#13;
de 35 reserves pour la conservation des livres dans les colleges.&#13;

c) Le projet va egalement financer un systeme informatique de suivi des stocks au niveau&#13;
des ecoles primaires et des colleges.&#13;
3. Actions a mener&#13;
a) Pour le Primaire:   Le projet va proceder, par appel d'offres international, a la&#13;
reimpression des livres de fran,ais et de calcul qui ont ete produits dans le cadre du 2e&#13;
Projet Education et dont les maitres ont e  formes a l'utilisation. Comme les copyrights&#13;
ont 6te cedes a des editeurs prives pour une periode de 10 ans (jusqu'en 1999 pour les&#13;
livres de fran,ais et l'an 2000 pour les livres de calcul), le Gouvernement va trouver un&#13;
accord avec ces editeurs pour permettre de reimprimer ces titres par appel d'offres&#13;
international, et par consequent de les faire financer dans le cadre du projet. Quant aux&#13;
livres de sciences, ils seront achetes sur le marche, par appel d'offres international, sur la&#13;
base de criteres techniques et pedagogiques.   Tous les livres seront colises par&#13;
ecole/inspection et livres directement aux ecoles par les fournisseurs'. La reception sera&#13;
effectuee par une commission presidee par le Directeur d'ecole et comprenant des&#13;
representants des enseignants, des parents ou de la communaute. Les representants des&#13;
syndicats et des partis politiques y assisteront en tant qu'observateurs.  Les guides&#13;
pedagogiques seront prets aux maitres. Les manuels seront mis a la disposition des&#13;
&amp;leves en contrepartie d'une contribution annuelle des parents de 200 francs CFA par an,&#13;
par enfant et pour les 3 livres.  Au niveau de chaque ecole, un comite preside par le&#13;
Directeur et comprenant les representants des maitres et des parents va utiliser les&#13;
sommes collectees pour assurer la protection, la bonne conservation et la securite des&#13;
livres, et pour remplacer les livres deteriores ou perdus2. Pour assurer le renouvellement&#13;
des livres acquis dans le cadre du projet, le Gouvernement va ouvrir un compte au Tresor&#13;
ou seront verses, chaque annee, ...%3 du budget de fonctionnement de 1'enseignement&#13;
primaire. Les montants annuels estimatifs qui seront deposes dans le compte sont&#13;
indiques au paragraphe 5. 1.&#13;
b) Pour le Deuxieme Degre:  Un titre par classe et par matiere sera selectionne par les&#13;
commissions chargees du choix des manuels scolaires. Un avis international sera lance&#13;
pour inviter les editeurs a soumettre des titres pour cette selection. Les titres selectionnes&#13;
seront regroupes en lots par discipline et achetes par appel d'offres international. Les&#13;
livres seront colises par college/inspection par les fournisseurs. Leur distribution aux&#13;
colleges sera assuree par la LIMUSCO. La reception sera effectuee par une commission&#13;
presidee par le Directeur et comprenant des representants des enseignants, des elves et&#13;
des parents. Les livres seront la propriete des colleges qui les mettront a la disposition&#13;
des elves a travers un systeme de location. Chaque college va se doter d'un comite pour&#13;
la mise en place et la gestion du systeme. Le comite sera charge de definir, a partir des&#13;
realites locales et des directives generales qui seront donnees par le MENRS, les&#13;
modalites d'organisation et de fonctionnement du systeme de location. II sera egalement&#13;
Les livres correspondant aux effectifs de l'annee 96/97 seront colises par ecole/inspection. Les exemplaires destines a couvrir&#13;
les accroissements d'effectifs seront livres en vrac a cause du manque de moyens de stockage dans les ecoles et pour plus&#13;
de flexibilite dans leur distribution (pour permettre, par exemple, de distribuer des livres aux ecoles qui seront creees&#13;
pendant la duree de vie du projet).&#13;
2 Les comites acheteront ces livres dans les librairies privees ou dans les magasins de la LIMUSCO.&#13;
3Le pourcentage et les montants annuels qui seront deposes dans le compte Tresor seront prdcises au cours des negociations.&#13;

Page 3 of 7&#13;
charge de recuperer les fonds provenant de la location et de les deposer dans un compte&#13;
ouvert au nom du college. Les colleges vont utiliser les fonds recuperes pour acquerir les&#13;
exemplaires pour couvrir accroissements d'effectifs, les deteriorations et les pertes&#13;
pendant la duree de vie du projet. Le nombre estimatif de ces exemplaires est donne au&#13;
paragraphe 5.2.&#13;
c) Pour permettre de savoir, A tout moment, le nombre et l'etat des livres dans les ecoles&#13;
primaires et les colleges, partant fixer des chiffres de tirage plus precis, la Direction de la&#13;
Planification du MENRS va proceder a une informatisation des operations de distribution&#13;
et des stocks.&#13;
d) Conservation et utilisation des livres: La bonne conservation des livres et leur utilisation&#13;
effective par les enseignants et les eleves du Primaire de meme que le bon&#13;
fonctionnement du systeme de location dans les colleges seront des criteres&#13;
d'appreciation des Directeurs, des maitres et des professeurs lors des inspections. Une&#13;
circulaire ministerielle donnera des instructions dans ce sens aux Directeurs des Premier&#13;
et Deuxieme Degres et aux Inspecteurs.&#13;
e) Avant le 31 mars 1996, le Gouvernement soumettra a l'IDA le projet d'Arrete ministeriel&#13;
portant institution d'un systeme de pret de livres dans le Primaire et d'un systeme de&#13;
location decentralise dans le Deuxieme Degre. Ce projet d'Arr&amp;e fixera le montant de la&#13;
contribution des parents pour les livres du Primaire et les modalites generales&#13;
d'organisation et de fonctionnement du systeme de location dans les colleges. II decrira&#13;
egalement les mecanismes pour controler aussi bien les fonds collectes au niveau des&#13;
ccoles primaires que la gestion du systeme de location dans les colleges.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF TOGO&#13;
EDUCATION REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
QUALITY SCHOOLS INITIATIVE&#13;
I.    Background. The implementation of the Education II Project in Togo showed that for in-&#13;
service education programs to be successfully translated into changed teacher behavior, they&#13;
must match the felt needs of teachers in a consistent manner over time. However, in Togo, in-&#13;
service training programs have been very top-down in nature, and implemented in inconsistent&#13;
fashion. The teachers who have stood in greatest need of these programs, i.e. the village-based&#13;
auxiliary teachers, have frequently not had access to these programs, which all too often have&#13;
failed entirely to account for local variations in teacher and student needs. The Quality Schools&#13;
Initiative designed under the current operation seeks to address this weakness by supporting&#13;
stakeholder involvement in designing and carrying out an innovative program of in-service&#13;
education based on needs expressed by teachers themselves. This program builds on existing&#13;
structures to introduce teaching innovations, and would help transform the role of regional and&#13;
prefectoral inspectors from one of administrative support to one of instructional support and&#13;
leadership.&#13;
I. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.    Long-term goals and objectives. The long-term goals of the Quality Schools Initiative&#13;
are derived from Government's statement of education sector policy, i.e. to improve the quality&#13;
of teaching and leaming in Togolese primary schools and to increase the level of community&#13;
involvement in the education programs. This program would be the operational mechanism&#13;
through which the school becomes the locus of change in the education system. As such, the&#13;
program is seen, not as a permanent feature of the educational scene in Togo, but as a key&#13;
transitional program over a five-year period, starting to redefine the role of teacher, principal,&#13;
pedagogic advisor, and inspector. It would have the following long-term objectives: (a) to help&#13;
teachers focus on improving subject matter teaching; (b) to improve the knowledge base of&#13;
teachers; (c) to promote community involvement in school activities; (d) to develop a feedback&#13;
loop permitting decision-makers to receive reliable information about the quality of teaching and&#13;
learning; and (e) to introduce promising new approaches to teaching into the educational system.&#13;
3.    Medium-term goals and objectives. The principal medium-term goals of the Quality&#13;
Schools Initiative are to operationalize the Government's commitment to bringing about school-&#13;
based change within Togolese primary schools and to pass the message of the need for&#13;
qualitative change in teaching to all stakeholders.  The medium-term  objectives are the&#13;
following: to help school personnel develop project proposals based on local school needs; to&#13;
train inspectors and pedagogic advisors to provide instructional support to teachers and school&#13;
directors; to develop community participation in the introduction of innovations; and to ensure&#13;
financial responsibility in the use of funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

II. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.    Project description. The project will involve the following elements: (a) the introduction&#13;
of innovative activities at the primary school level; (b) the use of action-research projects as a&#13;
tool for innovation and in-service training; (c) the participation of schools and their communities&#13;
for analysis of existing education problems and the development of tentative solutions; (d) the&#13;
increased use of national expertise; (e) increasing decentralization of responsibilities to the&#13;
regions; and (f) systematic follow-up of action-research and other school-level activities.&#13;
5.    Proposals for school improvement will fall into one of two categories: action research&#13;
projects and school/community projects. Approximately 300 small grants would be given on a&#13;
competitive basis to individual schools or school clusters for improving teaching and learning.&#13;
An additional 50 more broadly-based projects with external researchers (Ministry and university&#13;
personnel) would also be financed.&#13;
6.    Preparation of proposals. The process of pilot school identification and survey design&#13;
would provide a vehicle for consensus and capacity building in terms of how to go about&#13;
improving the way schools operate. The School Quality subcommittee (of the overall Steering&#13;
Committee) would be responsible for selecting and orienting school survey/research teams. The&#13;
small grants to individual schools or school clusters would be given on the basis of a proposals&#13;
prepared by the school teachers and directors themselves. The larger "action research" projects&#13;
would be selected through a competitive bidding process, in which public, quasi-public&#13;
(including the university and NGOs) and private research-oriented institutions would be invited&#13;
to submit survey proposals. A total of 72 small grants would be given during the first phase of&#13;
the project.&#13;
7.    Selection of proposals. Six selection committees (one in each of the five regions, and a&#13;
national committee located in Lome) will meet once a year for selection of the proposals. The&#13;
pre-selection at the regional level, and the final selection at the national level will be based on&#13;
criteria described in the operational manual. These include, but are not limited to, the following:&#13;
(a) the educational value of the proposed project, including its potential contribution to&#13;
improving teaching and learning at the school and the potential benefit for target groups such as&#13;
the poor, rural students, and girls; (b) the feasibility of the proposed project; (c) the capacities&#13;
and potential of unit members; and (d) the level of community support for the proposal.&#13;
8.    The program would begin with teams working in each of Togo's five geographic regions.&#13;
Schools would be chosen based on both the presence of innovative personnel and the existence&#13;
of promising local practices. To the extent possible, experimentation would build on local&#13;
practices. Examples of innovations to be considered are: (a) decentralized teacher supervision&#13;
and management systems, leading to a restructured role for school directors and inspectors,&#13;
(b) monitoring of teacher candidates based on traditional apprenticeship models and private&#13;
sector initiatives, and (c) increasing the role of communities in school management.&#13;
&#13;

9.    Training programs. An in-service teacher training program is being developed under this&#13;
component for training of all primary school teachers, based on the activities and results of the&#13;
Quality Schools Initiative itself-.The in-service training strategies would be centered on and&#13;
informed by the "action research" activities. It is further expected that the "action research"&#13;
programs would stimulate the mobilization of additional resources at the community level. In&#13;
addition, host schools would be expected to evolve into demonstration schools to be used for in-&#13;
service training.&#13;
10.   In the first two years of the project, the focus will be on the upgrading of auxiliary&#13;
teachers (approximately 30 percent of the total number of primary school teachers). These&#13;
teachers will receive a more intensive training program, but all teachers will receive a minimum&#13;
of three days in-service training over the first two years (approximately 6000 teachers each year).&#13;
Training seminars have already been held for the personnel who will form the central selection&#13;
committee. This seminar will be repeated in each region of the country for training the regional&#13;
selection committees and the program evaluators.  While the program  itself constitutes a&#13;
significant in-service training experience, additional training for school directors, pedagogic&#13;
advisors and inspectors will take place under the Ministerial Restructuring component of the&#13;
project. The training programs are described in the operational manual.&#13;
11.   Renewal of funding. School/community proposals will cover a one-year period with&#13;
financing to range from $1000 to $3000. The best initiatives could be renewed for a second year&#13;
or a third year, upon recommendation of the regional jury.&#13;
12.   First phase of in-service education. This program is a key element of the Government's&#13;
strategy for renewing in-service education over the project lifespan. The unit responsible for in-&#13;
service training (DIFOP), the National Institute of Education Sciences (INSE), and the&#13;
Elementary Education will participate in initial planning and training activities in order to&#13;
harmonize the role of each of these entities in this program.&#13;
II. EVALUATION AND FOLLOW-UP&#13;
12.   Reports. The selection committees will prepare reports of their activities and decisions.&#13;
Bi-monthly summaries of activities and expenses will be provided by the research units) for&#13;
transmission to the regional level. An end-of-year report will be prepared by each research unit&#13;
as per the criteria and issues outlined in the operational manual.&#13;
13.   Managing the change process. In order to ensure that the lessons learned at the school&#13;
level serve as a stimulus for the process of change in the country, regional seminars will be held&#13;
each summer. They will bring together representatives of all groups funded during the previous&#13;
year, as well as the other personnel associated with the program. The format will be that of a&#13;
professional conference (break-out groups followed by a plenary session). Representatives of the&#13;
action-research and the school/community groups will meet according to the themes they have&#13;
dealt with; each group will discuss the generalizability of the results obtained. A national&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 4 of 4&#13;
seminar will follow the regional seminars each year. Where appropriate, outside funding would&#13;
be sought for innovative groups to present their findings at professional conferences outside the&#13;
country.&#13;
15.   The survey/research process would give the Steering Committee, as well as IDA and&#13;
other donors, the opportunity to evaluate the capacity of the survey teams and to provide&#13;
constructive feedback where needed. The number of schools involved in the program would&#13;
expand depenrding on local capacity, resource availability, and results obtained. The Steering&#13;
Committee would be responsible for ensuring that all activities--survey team selection, school&#13;
selection, survey design preparation and survey implementation--are coordinated with the&#13;
relevant regional and district-level authorities. In particular, inspectors in the chosen school&#13;
districts would work closely with the survey tearns.&#13;
16.   Satellite school arrangements and instructional supervision guidelines for school&#13;
principals would be tested through the network of schools participating in the Quality Schools&#13;
Initiative. The Quality Schools Initiative would also help the Government monitor expenditures&#13;
within the framework of the education budget for routine teacher training and supervision. It&#13;
would also evaluate the impact of training on teaching quality and student learning outcomes.&#13;

EDUCATION REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT MONITORING AND SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
1.     IDA Supervision Input. Regular supervision needs are described in Table I of this Annex. In&#13;
addition, specific tasks such as review of progress reports, terms of reference, annual plans, audits, and&#13;
procurement and disbursement actions, are estimated to require 8 staff weeks of various specialist inputs a&#13;
year which are not included in Table 1.&#13;
2.     Borrower's Contribution to Supervision. The monitoring and evaluation of project progress and&#13;
outcomes would be integrated with the monitoring system established in the MENRS with the overall&#13;
responsibility assigned to the Steering Committee.  IDA-specific implementation matters, such as&#13;
procurement, disbursements and project accounting would be handled by the DAF, is located in the&#13;
Planning Directorate.&#13;
(a)   Proeress Reports would be submitted twice a year, in January and July. They would&#13;
include a summary of implementation under each project component, financial statements&#13;
on project expenditures, updated project implementation and procurement schedules, as&#13;
well as the status of contract advertising, bidding, awards and completion dates and&#13;
compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement. The Steering&#13;
Committee, in collaboration with the DAF, would collect inputs from each responsible&#13;
MENRS directorate and prepare the reports.&#13;
(b)   Joint Annual Reviews. Once a year, around November, the Steering Committee would&#13;
organize a joint IDA/Government review of project implementation based on: (i) the&#13;
progress report in the above paragraph which, for the purposes of the annual review, would&#13;
also include (ii) an annual work program and budget for the next academic year; (iii) a&#13;
draft budget for the overall education sector for the next year; and (iv) the status of policy&#13;
and project monitoring indicators as listed in Annex X. These reviews would include&#13;
broad representation of stakeholders and donors. During these joint reviews, progress&#13;
achieved in implementing the pilot schools initiative would be monitored.&#13;
(c)   Mid-Term Review. The Steering Committee, together with the DAF, would carry out not&#13;
later than 30 months after credit effectiveness, a mid-term review of the progress made in&#13;
canying out the project. They would cover all aspects of the project, with a special focus&#13;
on: (i) MENRS's functioning; (ii) progress in implementing policy measures and their&#13;
impact on staffing, cost and efficiency of the system; (iii) progress with the recruitment and&#13;
payment of auxiliary teachers; (iv) progress achieved in and lessons learned from the&#13;
quality schools initiative; (v) progress of school construction and rehabilitation; (vi) the&#13;
upkeep and maintenance of textbooks; (vii) training of personnel; and the introduction of a&#13;
decentralized Education Support Fund to be managed at the regional level. The mid-term&#13;
review would also be conducted with other donors affiliated with the project (e.g.&#13;
European Union, African Development Bank) and would review progress in the&#13;
implementation of their programs.&#13;
(d)   The Steering Committee would be responsible for coordinating arrangements for IDA&#13;
supervision missions and participating in the mission with them.&#13;
(e)   Implementation Completion Report. Within six months of the Credit closing date, a&#13;
completion report, prepared in accordance with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA,&#13;
would be transmitted to IDA.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Education Rehabilitation Project is
            designed to reverse the rapid deterioration in the education
            sector in Togo following several years of social and
            political unrest and a decade of declining enrollment and
            quality. The project has two objectives: to improve the
            quality of schools and to develop better education system
            management. The project comprises two components: 1) the
            development of better schools through school construction
            and rehabilitation, provision of textbooks, and the Quality
            of Schools Initiative; and 2) development of better
            education system management through decentralized
            recruitment and financing of teachers, development of system
            managment tools including information and communication
            systems, budgetary programming and monitoring, consolidation
            of the minsterial restructuring by strengthening
            decision-making process and further decentralizing the
            responsibility for instructional as well as financial management.
