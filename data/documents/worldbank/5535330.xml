EMERGENCY WATER SUPPLY, SANITATION AND URBAN RECONSTRUCTION&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
COUNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
1.       Large oil reserves and abundant human resources enabled Iraq to attain the&#13;
status of a middle income country in the 1 970s. The country developed good&#13;
infrastructure. Education and healthcare systems were widely regarded as the best in the&#13;
Middle East. Income per capita rose to over US$3,600 in the early 1980s. Since that time,&#13;
successive wars and a repressive, state-dominated economic system have stifled&#13;
economic growth and development and debilitated basic infrastructure and social&#13;
services. International trade sanctions imposed in 1991 took a toll on the economy.&#13;
Despite the country's rich resource endowment, Iraq's human development indicators are&#13;
now among the lowest in the region and income per capita dropped to about US$800 by&#13;
2001, with continued decline thereafter. Although there is a paucity of reliable economic&#13;
data, the 2003 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was estimated at about US$13 to 17&#13;
billion, or about US$480 to 630 per person.&#13;
2.       Years of conflicts, misdirected resources, and the affects of Iraq's centralized&#13;
command economy have stifled economic growth and development, curtailing Iraq's&#13;
ability to invest in new infrastructure and maintain existing facilities. Conflicts, looting,&#13;
and sabotage have also resulted in direct damage to buildings, pipelines, communication&#13;
equipment, and transportation links. Billing systems and associated revenues that&#13;
maintain operations have collapsed. Today most Iraqis have limited access to essential&#13;
basic services, including electricity, water supply, sanitation, and refuse collection.&#13;
Serious environmental and health risks associated with contaminated water supplies,&#13;
inappropriate handling of solid waste, and disposal of sewage threaten to further burden&#13;
the already stressed health system. The concentration of economic and social activities in&#13;
the main urban centers of Iraq has also led to a proliferation of under-serviced&#13;
neighborhoods in major Iraqi cities.&#13;
3.       At the end of the 2003 war, Iraq's infrastructure was seriously degraded. The&#13;
majority of the population had limited or inadequate access to essential basic services.&#13;
Those who could afford it relied on costly alternatives for electricity and water services.&#13;
Contaminated water supplies, improper handling of solid waste and disposal of sewage&#13;
led to environmental degradation and increased health hazards. The majority of&#13;
governorates suffer from insufficient and damaged urban roads and storm water drainage,&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
street lighting and social facilities. What had escaped destruction and looting operates at&#13;
minimal capacity due to years of neglect and lack of maintenance. This situation&#13;
weakened urban economies and the income of the population. The deficiency of basic&#13;
infrastructure services has added to the general lack of security in various parts of the&#13;
country.&#13;
KEY SECTORAL CHALLENGES&#13;
4.       Iraq has been subjected to the classic symptoms and causes of urbanization&#13;
trends usually experienced by developing countries and fuelled by an imbalanced&#13;
distribution of spatial development. Close to 70 percent of the estimated Iraqi population&#13;
of 26 million live in cities. Baghdad alone accounts for about 6 million, being 23 percent&#13;
of the total. The remarkable speed of growth of major cities has been attributed to the&#13;
concentration of the economic and social activities in the main urban centres, but that was&#13;
not subsequently matched by the required expansion in the provision of services.&#13;
The Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works&#13;
5.       The Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works (MMPW) was recently&#13;
created out of the Civil Services Division of the Iraq Interior Ministry. The MMPW is the&#13;
chief national policymaker for the provision of all municipal services, except for&#13;
electricity and telecommunications. It is responsible for delivery of safe drinking water,&#13;
environmental sanitation (wastewater and solid waste) services, urban development,&#13;
municipal road works, and public land management.&#13;
6.       The Ministry has offices in 266 municipalities in fifteen of the eighteen&#13;
govemorates in Iraq. The three Governorates of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Dohuk,&#13;
Arbil, and Sulaimaniyah, are affiliated but administered separately. More than 40,000&#13;
employees serve in the Ministry of Municipalities &amp; Public Works working at over 600&#13;
locations. The national general directorates provide administrative, financial and&#13;
technical support to each Govemorate and municipality. They are responsible for&#13;
overseeing water distribution systems, sewerage, and other municipal services. They&#13;
oversee installation and maintenance of water and sewerage treatment facilities. And they&#13;
also set and oversee the standards for design and operation for all municipal services,&#13;
such as refuse collection, municipal roads, cemeteries, abattoirs, and public parks.&#13;
7.       The aim of the Ministry is to decentralize service delivery and administrative&#13;
organization for increasing water supply coverage, reducing unaccounted for water&#13;
losses, and increasing sewerage coverage, as well as responses to issues and interests&#13;
expressed by local councils. The following sections summarize the current situation and&#13;
sectoral challenges.&#13;
8.       Water Supply and Sanitation Sector: Prior to the 1991 Gulf war, the&#13;
population of Iraq enjoyed a relatively high level of water supply and sanitation services.&#13;
The sector operated efficiently, utilizing then-current technologies. Water quality was&#13;
generally good as there were 229 and 1332 water treatment plants and water treatment&#13;
units, respectively, operating throughout the country. Over 95% of the urban population&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
and over 750% of the rural population had access to safe potable water. Sanitation services&#13;
covered about 75% of the urban communities (25% connected to sewerage systems and&#13;
50% with on-site septic tanks) and about 40% in rural areas.&#13;
9.        Since 1991, the water supply and sanitation sector has experienced a steady&#13;
but devastating decline. Aging infrastructure, poorly maintained equipment, leaking&#13;
water and sewer networks and low technical capacity and morale are some of the key&#13;
problems of the sector. The lack of funding led to insufficient imports, lack of&#13;
maintenance, and curtailment of needed expansion. These services were surpassed by&#13;
other national priorities, which resulted in a serious degradation of the quality and extent&#13;
of services delivered. Many Iraqi cities do not have adequate water or sewage treatment&#13;
plants. Even in cities and communities where there are treatment systems, many have&#13;
fallen into disrepair after years of neglect. At the same time, water and sewerage&#13;
systems, with their intricate network of pumps, are constantly strained by regular and&#13;
frequent power outages.&#13;
10.      The current estimated daily demand for potable water is 9 million cubic&#13;
meters. The MMPW's total potable water production capacity is approximately 6.8&#13;
million cubic meters per day based on 22 hours of operation per day. Potable water&#13;
services only cover 80% of the Iraqi population via a 16,500 km network of which at&#13;
least 30% needs replacement. Only 9% of the urban population outside Baghdad is served&#13;
by sewerage systems, while rural areas and the north do not have piped sewerage&#13;
systems. Moreover, the unavailability of continuous power supply due to infrastructure&#13;
damages has crippled the ability of the ministries and water and sanitation authorities to&#13;
manage and to operate basic services.&#13;
11.      Diseases associated with poor sanitation, unsafe water and unhygienic&#13;
practices had increased to alarming rates. Many Iraqi cities do not have adequate water or&#13;
sewage treatment plants and even where there are treatment systems, many have fallen&#13;
into disrepair from years of neglect. It is estimated that 50% of Iraq's population have no&#13;
access to clean drinking water. It is estimated that water related diseases are responsible&#13;
for about 25% of all deaths of children in Iraq; about 109 per 1000 children die before the&#13;
age of one.&#13;
12.      Existing consumer tariffs are extremely low and barely cover the cost of water&#13;
and operation and maintenance costs. Current prices of water do not reflect shadow prices&#13;
in the production costs. Because of the prevailing volatile economic, political and&#13;
security situation in Iraq, it is not expected that cost-reflective tariffs will be introduced&#13;
immediately.&#13;
13.      A recent UNICEF report describes the current situation as follows:&#13;
* Water services in most cities are limited to a few hours a day of poor&#13;
quality water;&#13;
* Routine maintenance of water networks is rare and water losses are in&#13;
excess of 50%;&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
* More than 70% of all sewage is not treated, resulting in over one million&#13;
cubic meters of raw sewage being discharged to rivers daily;&#13;
* Broken-down pumping stations have resulted in clogging of sewers&#13;
causing backflows of sewage into streets, homes, hospitals and schools;&#13;
and,&#13;
* Extensive leaking networks are causing sewage to seep back into the water&#13;
supply system and posing serious health risks.&#13;
14.      Currently, there is an ongoing effort by donor countries, such as the United&#13;
States (US) (through the US Agency for International Development (USAID)), Japan, the&#13;
European Union (EU), etc., as well as efforts by multilateral agencies such as the United&#13;
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme&#13;
(UNDP), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and Non Governmental&#13;
Organizations (NGOs), to restore the sector to standards that existed prior to the latest&#13;
conflict. Their activities include clean water tankering each day to people, especially in&#13;
the cities of Al-Basra, Al-Muthanna, Kirkuk, and Mosul, to mitigate against water-borne&#13;
disease, repairing and expanding of water and sanitation facilities and their networks,&#13;
water quality monitoring, procurement of much needed water treatment chemicals,&#13;
garbage collection, and promotion of hygiene education.&#13;
15.      Municipal Roads and Sidewalks: according to the United Nations/World&#13;
Bank Joint Iraq Needs Assessment, October 2003, only 20-30 percent of the 14,193 km&#13;
secondary roads linking towns with the Govemorates are in good condition. While, just&#13;
10 percent of the 3,704 km roads that provide villages and towns with access to the&#13;
secondary network are considered to be in good condition, as shown in Table 1 below.&#13;
Table 1: Length and Condition of Secondary and Tertiary Roads&#13;
Classification      Length (km) Good %    Fair %   Poor %&#13;
Secondary Roads        14,193       20       70      10&#13;
City and village Roads  3,704       10       30      60&#13;
16.      On the other hand, the MMPW estimates that about 17,000 km of roads,&#13;
varying between 7-15 m in width, need paving or resurfacing. Maintenance of roads and&#13;
sidewalks in the centres of the governorates started in 1999 as some equipment were&#13;
imported under the Oil for Food Programme. However, most roads have not been well&#13;
maintained in recent years, and storm water networks, signage, and other highway&#13;
furniture that was damaged or missing has not been replaced or upgraded.&#13;
17.      Iraq had one of the lowest vehicle ownership rates in the region with the&#13;
demand being suppressed for a number of years. However, post-war lack of control led to&#13;
an influx of about 500,000 vehicles, drastically increasing the size of Iraq's vehicle fleet.&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
The road system was not designed to cope with this volume, and traffic is beginning to&#13;
choke transport within the cities. Furthermore, the unpaved and dilapidated conditions of&#13;
roads in the cities and residential quarters, the lack of proper storm water drainage, and&#13;
the formation of stagnant water pools and the muddy/sandy roads' conditions are&#13;
impeding the flow of human and vehicular traffic and increasing health risks. Improving&#13;
the roads' conditions and increasing their capacity in major urban areas becomes&#13;
necessary for improved access of the populations to markets and social services and for&#13;
the economic well-being of the city.&#13;
18.      Community Facilities: Urban authorities are responsible for a range of real&#13;
estate properties such as parking lots, slaughterhouses, a number of factories and&#13;
workshops, and leisure halls. Most of these buildings and facilities are in need of major&#13;
maintenance and upgrading. Of special concern are the slaughterhouses, which are&#13;
lacking any kind of modem meat processing equipment or butchering systems. The&#13;
disposal and waste system, and animal retention areas and pens are primitive, ineffective,&#13;
and a major health risk. Furthermore, environmental standards for odour control, waste&#13;
disposal, and effluent control and treatment do not exist.&#13;
THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE&#13;
19.      Following the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the international community was&#13;
quick to recognize the need for a multilateral approach to the reconstruction and&#13;
development of Iraq. At the request of the international community, the World Bank and&#13;
the United Nations Development Group worked closely to produce an assessment of&#13;
Iraq's reconstruction needs. The Joint UN/WB Needs Assessment estimated total needs&#13;
for the period 2004-2007 to be US$55 billion, comprising US$35.8 billion for the&#13;
fourteen sectors covered by the Needs Assessment', and US$19.4 billion estimated by the&#13;
then Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), for other sectors including security and oil.&#13;
The Joint Needs Assessment served as a basis for an international donors' conference&#13;
held in Madrid in October of 2003, where donors pledged about US$32 billion for the&#13;
period 2004-2007. Follow-up Donor Committee meetings are regularly held to review&#13;
priorities submitted by each ministry, assess the progress made to date and coordinate&#13;
bilateral and multilateral reconstruction efforts. To date, only a small portion of these&#13;
pledges has been actually committed and disbursed.&#13;
20.      To ensure swift, flexile, and coordinated donor financing for priority&#13;
investments identified in the Needs Assessment, the World Bank and the UN designed an&#13;
International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq, consisting of two trust funds-a&#13;
World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) and a UNDG Iraq Trust Fund-with mechanisms for&#13;
close coordination. So far, about US$1 billion have been pledged for the UN and the&#13;
World Bank Trust Funds for 2004/2005. Projects presented for funding under the Trusts&#13;
Funds are submitted for approval to the Iraqi Strategic Review Board (ISRB), chaired by&#13;
l The sectors are: education; health; employment creation; water and sanitation; transport and&#13;
telecommunications; electricity; housing and land management; urban management; agriculture, water&#13;
resources, and food security; finance; state-owned industries; investment climate; mine action; and&#13;
government institutions. The cross-cutting themes are: gender, environment, and human rights.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation (MOPDC), to ensure that&#13;
projects are in-line with country priorities, and that no duplication occurs.&#13;
21.   Most of the US$32 billion pledged for Iraq's reconstruction will be channelled&#13;
bilaterally. The United States (US) is the single largest contributor to Iraq's&#13;
reconstruction, with an approximate supplemental budget of US$18.4 billion approved by&#13;
US Congress in late 2003. The US has already awarded several major contracts for&#13;
physical and social infrastructure rehabilitation. However, Iraq still faces a large gap in&#13;
financing for emergency reconstruction and capacity building. Inadequate infrastructure&#13;
service delivery remains a critical problem that lowers the quality of life in Iraq,&#13;
contributes to poor security, and thwarts economic recovery and development.&#13;
22.   The UN, which has experience working in Iraq under the Oil-For-Food program,&#13;
is also expected to play an important role in addressing infrastructure needs. It currently&#13;
has 23 agencies working in Iraq with local staff, and, like the World Bank, has&#13;
established an operational presence in Amman for international staff. The UN and the&#13;
World Bank sectors of intervention may overlap, making it essential that respective&#13;
project teams work closely together to ensure that each institution capitalizes on its&#13;
comparative advantages and duplication of works is avoided.&#13;
23.      Many donors are contributing to the reconstruction process in Iraq. Donors&#13;
also financed projects executed by national and international organizations and NGOs.&#13;
Among the international organizations and NGOs active in the urban sector are UNICEF,&#13;
UNHABITAT, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mercy Corps,&#13;
World vision, Care, Premiere Urgence. Some of the donors' activities in the urban sector&#13;
include:&#13;
* USAID repaired hundreds of breaks in Iraq's neglected water supply and&#13;
sewerage systems in Baghdad, Najaf, Karbala, Hillah, Fallujah, Wasit, Basra,&#13;
Kirkuk and Mosul.&#13;
*  CIDA financed UNICEF, Care Canada, and the ICRC for the rehabilitation of&#13;
water and sanitation systems, health, and education.&#13;
*  ECHO funded emergency relief operations in the amount of Euros300 millions&#13;
for rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation, with a particular emphasis on&#13;
improving water and sanitation facilities in schools. ECHO funded ICRC,&#13;
UNICEF, CARE, and Premiere Urgence.&#13;

B. THE RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
24.   In January 2004, the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors discussed an&#13;
Interim Strategy note of the World Bank Group for Iraq and authorized the Bank to act as&#13;
administrator of the ITF, which was created jointly by the World Bank and other donors2.&#13;
25.   This project is fully consistent with the Interim Strategy Note, which emphasizes&#13;
the need for rapid rehabilitation of critical infrastructure and services, short-term&#13;
employment generation, and institutional capacity building as prerequisites for long-term&#13;
sustainable recovery.&#13;
26.   There are important reasons for the Bank to be involved at this stage in&#13;
rehabilitating Iraq's infrastructure:&#13;
* Bank financing can complement ongoing infrastructure investments. Despite&#13;
relatively large amounts of financing for infrastructure from bilateral donors,&#13;
there remains a huge financing gap for infrastructure rehabilitation, which&#13;
remains one of the biggest obstacles to economic recovery. This gap has&#13;
recently increased with the decision of the US to reallocate about US$3.4&#13;
billion towards security, of which over US$1 billion had been allocated to&#13;
the Water Supply and Sanitation sectors;&#13;
* The Bank is in a position to share international experiences and best&#13;
practices based on the Bank's considerable international experience with&#13;
infrastructure reconstruction projects in conflict-affected areas (including&#13;
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ethiopia, West Bank and Gaza, and Afghanistan);&#13;
* Bank financing, unlike the financing of many other donors, will be&#13;
implemented by Iraqi institutions (ministries and agencies), which will&#13;
ensure Iraqi ownership and build Iraq's institutional capacity, both crucial&#13;
for the country's sustainable development; and&#13;
* The Bank will couple financing for rehabilitation with policy advice, assisting the&#13;
Government with urgent policy decisions, while laying the ground for sector&#13;
restructuring, essential for long-term sustainability of infrastructure investments.&#13;
APPLYING LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
27.      The Bank's increased role in post-conflict reconstruction over the past decade&#13;
has provided a wealth of experience on which to draw. Now guided by the World Bank&#13;
Operational Policy (OP) 2.30, Development Cooperation and Conflict, the Bank's&#13;
reconstruction efforts put a premium on early but selective engagement, flexibility in&#13;
design and implementation, capacity building, coordination with donors and other&#13;
partners, and close monitoring and evaluation. Notwithstanding the broadening into&#13;
2 To date, the Donor Committee includes: Australia, Canada, EC, Finland, Iceland, India, Japan, Korea,&#13;
Kuwait, Netherlands, Norway, Qatar, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
multi-sectoral assistance, the World Bank Operations Evaluation Department (OED) has&#13;
recognized the Bank's continued comparative advantage in rebuilding physical&#13;
3&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
28.      On the question of working in insecure environments, OP 2.30 recognizes that&#13;
even in countries in conflict the Bank should "continue efforts at poverty reduction and&#13;
maintenance of socioeconomic assets" and in developing a program for a country in&#13;
transition from conflict may become involved incrementally. The Bank's recent&#13;
experience in Afghanistan provides the clearest precedent where selective assistance was&#13;
mobilized ahead of, and in support of, a fully-developed transitional support strategy.&#13;
29.      In line with these lessons, the project will be kept flexible to permit a quick&#13;
response to changing circumstances. In addition, the Bank has conducted generic&#13;
training, including project management, procurement, financial management, and&#13;
environmental and social safeguards, for staff members of ministries associated with&#13;
infrastructure. Further capacity building will take place in the coming months to ensure&#13;
client readiness in project implementation. Early and effective collaboration with other&#13;
donor agencies has also proven vital in previous emergency operations, such as&#13;
Afghanistan. Accordingly, the project team is in close contact with other external&#13;
partners, including the United Nations, United States, European Union, United Kingdom,&#13;
and Japan. The project team is also in regular discussions through videoconferences with&#13;
representatives of line ministries; several face-to-face meetings have taken place outside&#13;
of Iraq.&#13;
C. THE PROJECT&#13;
30.      The   project represents the  part of the  Emergency  Infrastructure&#13;
Reconstruction Program, described in the Project Information Document (PID) of April&#13;
21, 2004, which intended to cover five sectors: water supply and sanitation, electricity,&#13;
urban rehabilitation, transport, and telecommunications. In view of the limited&#13;
availability of funds at the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (WBITF), and the expressed&#13;
interest of donors for certain sectors, the project will focus on the urgent water supply,&#13;
sanitation and municipal infrastructure needs of cities outside Baghdad. A companion&#13;
water supply and sanitation project for Baghdad is being proposed given the Capital&#13;
City's independent status, its historical responsibility for infrastructure services within its&#13;
boundary, and the severity of the physical and environmental damages to its facilities&#13;
during the last conflict.&#13;

PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
31.      The principal objective of the project is to restore some basic water supply,&#13;
sanitation and urban services for urban areas outside Baghdad City through (a) the&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation of existing facilities, and (b) providing capacity building&#13;
support through training and technical assistance. This project also aims to improve the&#13;
existing environmental and health conditions by renewing the old water networks and&#13;
sanitation services. It will also contribute to the reduction of waterbome diseases through&#13;
the reduction of water supply by tankers and the provision of potable water and sanitation&#13;
networks. This would also help improve the economic conditions of the population by&#13;
reducing the amounts of water obtained from tankers, which is generally more expensive.&#13;
The project will complement support by other donors. The project will also create vitally&#13;
needed short-term employment and help build Iraq's capacity to manage large-scale&#13;
reconstruction.&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;

and upgrading of three low lift pumps (two operational and one stand by pump), three&#13;
high lift pumps (two operational and one stand by pump) and a pumping station.&#13;
&gt; Component 7 - Upgrading of Badawa Water Supply System (Estimated cost&#13;
of US$1.50 million)&#13;
39.   This project is located in Badawa slum, Quarter 94, in Arbil City where about&#13;
6,000 thousand extremely poor families, with a total size of 42,000 inhabitants, live. The&#13;
area is completely dependant on water wells to supply drinking water. The existing water&#13;
distribution network is available to only 30% of the population and provides about 14&#13;
l/c/d. Losses in the network exceed 20% and the limited supply is often interrupted by&#13;
power failures. The proposed component will help provide potable water and sewerage&#13;
services to the population of Badawa, and will protect the water wells. The component&#13;
consists of supplying and installing a water distribution network, drilling 10 wells,&#13;
installing pump houses, storage tanks, chlorinators and diesel generators.&#13;
0 Component 8 - Upgrading of Dohuk Water Supply and Stormwater&#13;
Drainage Systems (Estimated cost of US$4.92 million)&#13;
40.   Over the past 2 years the Govemorate of Dohuk has distributed 10,000 plots of&#13;
land in the western sector of the city to poor and displaced families. At present, a&#13;
population of approximately 32,000 lives in the component area without any sewage or&#13;
potable water services. This component will consist mainly of supplying and constructing&#13;
a water distribution network and a storm-water drainage system to relieve the existing&#13;
conditions.&#13;
&gt; Component 9 - Upgrading of Dukan Water Supply System (Estimated cost of&#13;
US$4.48 million)&#13;
41.   The existing water supply system in Dukan was first constructed in 1982 and is in&#13;
urgent need for a total and complete rehabilitation. The objective of this component is to&#13;
increase the access and supply of water to parts of Dukan. This component will address&#13;
all aspects of rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing water supply system: it will&#13;
include the installation of a water supply system (distribution network, pumps, reservoir&#13;
tanks, etc.), the construction of intake works and the construction of a water treatment&#13;
plant.&#13;
&gt; Component 10 - Karbala Urban Rehabilitation&#13;
(Estimated cost of US$6.40 million)&#13;
42.   Karbala is an important religious centre that attracts around 5,000 daily visitors&#13;
and around 3 to 4 million visitors during important religious events. The streets and&#13;
squares in the city are in a dilapidated condition, due to the conflict and lack of&#13;
maintenance and resources. In their current state, they are impeding the flow of vehicular&#13;
and human traffic of both the locals and visitors. The bazaar is in a derelict state that&#13;
needs urgent rehabilitation and upgrading. Lastly, the existing slaughterhouse which&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
currently serves as the only public slaughterhouse in the Govemorate is outdated,&#13;
severely contaminated, and located within a major residential area. The objective of this&#13;
component is to carry out urgently needed urban rehabilitation projects to accommodate&#13;
the large number of visitors in an area that has not undergone rehabilitation works for&#13;
over a decade. This component involves (i) the rehabilitation of existing damaged streets&#13;
and squares, (ii) the rehabilitation of the traditional market (Bazaar) in Al-Abbas street;&#13;
and, (iii) an Environmental Impact Assessment Study (EIAS) and Design of a New&#13;
Municipal Slaughterhouse.&#13;
&gt; Component 11 - Badawa Urban Rehabilitation&#13;
(Estimated cost of US$7.76 million)&#13;
43.   This component will address the poverty stricken district of Badawa in south-&#13;
eastern Arbil. The work is municipal in nature and compliments the concurrent World&#13;
Bank initiative for Water &amp; Sanitation Improvements for this area. This component&#13;
includes (i) the construction of storm water network to collect and drain rainwater into&#13;
the city trunk main, and, (ii) upgrading of un-paved neighbourhood roads and main&#13;
streets.&#13;
I Component 12 - Basra Urban Rehabilitation&#13;
(Estimated cost of US$7.78 million)&#13;
44.   This component addresses the deteriorated condition of the main streets, the&#13;
unpaved internal streets, and the stagnant water pools due to the lack of storm water&#13;
drainage in Al-Jamiaa neighbourhood west of Basra. The work is municipal in nature and&#13;
will focus on the selected sub-district (Al-Jamiaa) within the larger Al-Qibla district and&#13;
is aimed to improve the municipal service sector. The component will provide for: (i)&#13;
resurfacing of main streets, (ii) upgrading of neighbourhood internal dirt roads to paved&#13;
roads, (iii) the construction of pedestrian sidewalks; and, (iv) construction of a new storm&#13;
water drainage network.&#13;
&gt; Component 13 - Capacity Building and Technical Assistance&#13;
(Estimated total cost of US$ 4.00 million)&#13;
45.   This component is essential to ensure the proper implementation of the project&#13;
and to train MMWP staff throughout Iraq on efficient utility practices and financing. It&#13;
will include the following activities:&#13;
a. Consulting services to complete final designs and tender documents;&#13;
b. Consulting services for construction and implementation supervision;&#13;
c. Capacity building and training in specific technical areas;&#13;
d. Design and implementation of appropriate accounting, financial&#13;
management, information, billing and collection, and related systems;&#13;
e. Consulting services to asses demand characteristics, cost of supply, demand&#13;
management and tariff structures;&#13;
f. Individual consultants to support the Project Management Team (PMT);&#13;
g. International audits;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
h. Office equipment, vehicles, furniture and operation costs for the PMT; and,&#13;
i. Feasibility studies and final designs for follow-up projects.&#13;
46.   This project will improve the quality of life of more than 2 million Iraqi citizens.&#13;
Nevertheless, the needs remain quite high. The UN/WB Joint Needs Assessment&#13;
estimated at US$6.8 billion the total rehabilitation needs of the Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation sector and at US$384 million of the Urban Management sector. Based on these&#13;
figures, this project will contribute to less than 1% and about 8% of the total needs,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
47.    A Grant of US$90 million is proposed to cover the costs of this project. The&#13;
MMWP has agreed to cover the cost of Iraqi staff seconded to the Project Management&#13;
Team (PMT), described below.&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
48.   The MMPW will be the implementing agency and the Recipient of the Grant.&#13;
Other Iraqi institutions such as the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of&#13;
Water Resources would be associated indirectly with the project for clearances and&#13;
reviews in accordance with national requirements.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
49.   The project will be implemented by the MMPW. The PMT reporting to the&#13;
Minister of the MMWP has been nominated with experienced staff seconded, on a full&#13;
time basis, from existing technical and financial units. Many of these staff have attended&#13;
initial training courses and workshops organized by the World Bank, UN agencies and&#13;
other bilateral donors. The PMT will closely coordinate its daily activities with the&#13;
different departments of the ministry. The PMT includes, but is not be limited to a core&#13;
team of: a director, two procurement specialist, two project engineers, one financial&#13;
management specialist, one environmental safeguards specialist, one administrative&#13;
assistant, one quality assurance staff and one legal advisor.&#13;
50.   The PMT will be supported, from time to time by consultants of different&#13;
expertise to assist with final designs, tender documents, tendering, financial management&#13;
and supervision of works. The consultants will also provide on-the-job training. The&#13;
capacity building component provides financing for additional professional training&#13;
locally or with international institutes.&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project TechnicalAnnex&#13;
51.   International and local consultants were recruited by the World Bank to assist the&#13;
MMPW to complete the project briefs and to carry out initial analysis and due diligence&#13;
on all the proposed sub-projects. The consultants' assessments have been received and&#13;
reviewed by Bank staff.&#13;
52.   To the extent possible, components have been separated into small size packages&#13;
to allow for local contractors' participation in the reconstruction efforts. Nevertheless,&#13;
some components have been grouped into large sector contracts for equipment supply to&#13;
simplify implementation and permit direct disbursement of funds.&#13;
53.   The MOPDC and ISRB have reviewed and cleared all the proposed sub-projects.&#13;
In line with the requirements of the Iraq Trust Fund, a monitoring agent will be recruited&#13;
to ensure adherence to the overall requirements of the Trust Fund.&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
54.   Procurement for this Project will be carried out in accordance with the World&#13;
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004;&#13;
and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Grant&#13;
Recipients" dated May 2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Grant Agreement. Also,&#13;
procurement will be undertaken in conformity with the Master Implementation Manual&#13;
(MIM), due for completion in December 2004. Detailed description of the procurement&#13;
methods or consultant selection methods are specified in the Procurement Plan (PP)&#13;
(Annex 7). The PP will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual&#13;
project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.&#13;
55.   Procurement of Works and Goods: For International Competitive Bidding (ICB)&#13;
of Works and Goods, the standard bidding documents (SBD) of the Bank will be used.&#13;
These will be: Procurement of Works, Procurement of Smaller Works, Supply and&#13;
Installation of Equipment (to be used for the construction and installation of water&#13;
treatment plants and facilities, with appropriate modifications) and the SBD for the&#13;
Procurement of Goods. For procurement under National Competitive Bidding (NCB),&#13;
agreement should be reached on a standard bidding document, in Arabic, that will be&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, in line with the MIM. In case development of these SBDs is&#13;
delayed, Bank Standard Bidding Documents for Smaller Works could be used with&#13;
appropriate modifications that are specific to Iraq. Simple Works will be procured&#13;
following the procedures of procurement of minor works on the basis of quotations&#13;
obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation.&#13;
Shopping of Goods will be used as presented in the procurement arrangement.&#13;
56.   Selection of Consultants: Consultants' services procured under this project will&#13;
include: selection of consultants to provide engineering services such as review update&#13;
and finalization of the detailed design and preparation of tender documents of the&#13;
projects that will be financed by the proposed Grant; selection of a specialized firm and&#13;
individuals to assist the PMT in project implementation in the areas of : training of&#13;
MMPW staff in procurement, financial management, project management and other&#13;
technical fields as needed. Shortlists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in&#13;
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
Assessment of MMPW capacity with procurement&#13;
57.   Based on the existing information on the overall environment for procurement in&#13;
Iraq and in particular within the MMPW, the overall procurement risk assessment is&#13;
judged to be high.&#13;
58.   The MMPW is currently implementing projects financed by the Iraqi national&#13;
budget (US$220 million) as well as other sizable infrastructure projects financed by&#13;
donors. This reflects that the MMPW is capable of implementing all projects financed&#13;
under the Grant using its own staff and facilities. The Bank, however, would work&#13;
closely with its counterpart team in the Ministry to build knowledge in Bank procurement&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
59.   There is no centralized procurement department in the current organizational&#13;
structure of the MMPW. Procurement is carried out by each department of the MMPW&#13;
through a specialized unit. International and local procurement are closely coordinated&#13;
with the Department of Administrative Affairs and Department of Technical Affairs.&#13;
60.   Procurement activities under the project will be carried out by the PMT; two&#13;
procurement staff has been recruited. These recruits will be trained on and become well-&#13;
versed in Bank procurement procedures within the first three months after Grant signing.&#13;
Such training can be obtained through attending formal courses in international&#13;
institutions that delivers training on Bank procurement.&#13;
61.   Construction supervision and site progress reporting will be the responsibility of&#13;
the technical department of the field office of the MMPW located at the different&#13;
Governorates, while procurement will be implemented centrally by the PMT. The same&#13;
will apply to three northern Govemorates (Arbil, Duhkan and Sulaimaniah) which report&#13;
to Kurdestan Regional Governorate. The procurement will be handled entirely by the&#13;
PMT established within the MMPW, as per the agreement between the MMPW and the&#13;
Ministry of Municipalities and Tourism (MMT), on the behalf of the three northern&#13;
governorates.&#13;
62.   Given that the procurement environment which prevailed in Iraq during the last&#13;
two decades was different from the norms of acceptable international practice and the&#13;
legal and regulatory changes introduced by the then CPA, public procurement will&#13;
predictably bear a high level of risk in the near future. The risk lies essentially in the lack&#13;
of good laws and regulations, modern standard documentation, lack of training of&#13;
concerned staff in procurement using Bank guidelines and international sound&#13;
procurement practice, the lack of law enforcement which would increase the risk of&#13;
looting and the damaging of facilities, and the inability of Bank procurement staff to&#13;
supervise project in the field.&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
63.   On the positive side however, Iraq has a wealth of procurement and engineering&#13;
staff that may be retrained rapidly to operate a reformed procurement system, and use&#13;
new procurement documents and tools as they become available. Eight of the MMPW&#13;
staff has already received two three-week training courses in procurement, financial, and&#13;
project management that were organized by the World Bank in Jordan.&#13;
Recommendations and Action Plan to Build the Agencies Capacity:&#13;
-  Two procurement officers are assigned to the PMT. These two officers will&#13;
receive both formal and ad-hoc procurement training on efficient handling of the&#13;
procurement activities under the project.&#13;
- An international consultant with field offices in Iraq will be recruited to assist the&#13;
PMT in procurement, financial and project management. This firm would assist&#13;
MMPW in establishing a procurement monitoring and reporting system.&#13;
-  Series of training sessions and workshops will be carried out during appraisal&#13;
throughout project implementation. The target audience would be PMT staff and&#13;
other employees of the MMPW.&#13;
-  The Master Implementation Manual (MIM), expected to be finalized by January&#13;
2005, would be adapted to the particular circumstances of the MMPW. The MIM&#13;
would provide standard procurement documents, evaluation reports, progress&#13;
reports, filing requirements that would be followed throughout project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
-  The thresholds for prior review by the Bank are set at a low level, to allow Bank&#13;
staff to provide hands-on training to staff of the PMT.&#13;
-  A Project Launch Workshop would be held in Arabic (or with Arabic translation)&#13;
soon after Grant signing. All staff involved in the implementation should attend&#13;
the workshop and it will be most critical that this staff be assigned on time.&#13;
DISBURSEMENT&#13;
64.   The proposed Grant of US$90 million is expected to be disbursed by August 31,&#13;
2007. Annex 2 describes the allocation of the Grant proceeds according to each&#13;
expenditure category, as well as the time-based disbursement plan.&#13;
65.   The Bank's strategy in Iraq is to ensure Iraqi ownership and strengthen&#13;
institutional capacity by financing operations that are implemented by Iraqi ministries&#13;
and other recipient entities. Trained Project Management Teams (PMTs) will facilitate&#13;
implementation and help ensure compliance with fiduciary and other safeguards. PMTs&#13;
will be employed and paid by the implementing entity at regular salary levels, thereby&#13;
avoiding the disadvantages of stand-alone Project Implementation Units that can erode&#13;
civil service institutional capacity over the medium and long term. The project will&#13;
finance specialized technical support in procurement, financial management, and other&#13;
areas as needed. In addition, to ensure that project funds are used for the purposes&#13;
intended and to help carry out project supervision, the World Bank will employ two&#13;
independent firms as Fiduciary and Safeguards Monitoring Agents.&#13;

Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
66.   As a further compensating control, disbursements will be made primarily by&#13;
direct payment by the Bank to the contractors, consultants, and vendors. Once authorized&#13;
by the Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works (MMPW), direct payments will be&#13;
made by the World Bank directly into the account of the contractor, consultant, or vendor&#13;
in a commercial bank capable of receiving funds transferred from the international&#13;
banking system.&#13;
67.   The project management component and payments below the threshold of&#13;
$10,000 normally will be made through payments by the Recipient from its own&#13;
resources. These payments made from the Recipient's own resources will be reimbursed,&#13;
on a periodic basis, by the World Bank to the MMPW upon presentation of relevant&#13;
supporting documents, proof of payment, and a signed withdrawal application. The PMT&#13;
and the main financial counterparts from the MMPW will be subject to intensive training&#13;
in the Bank's disbursement procedures.&#13;
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
68.   Bank policies require that Grant proceeds be used only for the purposes for which&#13;
they were granted, with due regard to economy and efficiency, and the sustainable&#13;
achievement of the project's development objectives. The Recipient, MMPW, is required&#13;
in this regard to cause the PMT to maintain an appropriate and adequate financial&#13;
management system, including records and accounts, and prepare financial statements&#13;
adequate to separately reflect the operations, resources, and expenditures of the project.&#13;
The grant Agreement also commits the recipient to have financial statements of the&#13;
project audited for each fiscal year by a qualified auditor acceptable to the Bank&#13;
following internationally accepted standards. The audit report should be submitted to the&#13;
Bank within six months of year end.&#13;
69.   Financial Management Risk Assessment.   The financial management risk&#13;
associated with this operation is considered high. Critical risk factors are: (i) ongoing&#13;
insecurity, which prevents on-site Bank supervision and assessments, including financial&#13;
management assessments; (ii) the Bank's limited knowledge of Iraq's public financial&#13;
management systems, controls, and procedures; (iii) the limited knowledge on the part of&#13;
Iraqi authorities of Bank policies and guidelines; (iv) MMPW making available on a&#13;
timely basis financial resources to honor payments below the value of $10,000; (v)&#13;
difficult communication and flow of information between worksites and the PMT, which&#13;
could delay payments; (vi) inefficiencies in Iraq's banking system that delay payments&#13;
and transfer of funds to contractors, suppliers, or MMPW; and (vii) variation orders that&#13;
may exceed price contingencies and difficulty may be encountered in verifying&#13;
justification for variation orders. Although the project design mitigates to the extent&#13;
possible these risks, the project will require close monitoring and supervision during&#13;
implementation. A detailed financial management risk assessment is in Annex 9.&#13;
70.   The control risks will be mitigated by putting in place additional controls and&#13;
procedures including: (a) the PMT will verify and authorize payments under the project&#13;
and verify justification for variation orders; (b) the PMT will maintain accounting system&#13;
for the project and retain project's records and supporting documents; (c) a qualified&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project TechnicalAnnex&#13;
financial manager will be appointed for the PMT financed under the Grant, and the PMT&#13;
will be assigned a competent financial officer and finance assistant from MMPW who&#13;
will be supported by a financial management consultant; (d) the Minister will designate&#13;
an internal auditor from the internal audit department of MMPW to track and verify the&#13;
project financial transactions; (e) disbursements by the Bank will be made primarily by&#13;
direct payments and on reimbursement basis supported by full documentation; (f) the&#13;
Fiduciary Monitoring Agent will review project expenditures and Withdrawal&#13;
Applications; (g) the internal audit department at MMPW will maintain ledger account&#13;
for each contract to track all payments made against each contract and avoid&#13;
overpayment; and (h) close control will be exercised on all project documents and&#13;
payment supporting documents at the PMT.&#13;
71.   The accounting and reporting risks will be managed by putting in place a simple&#13;
computerized system using spreadsheet applications, capable of recording all project&#13;
expenditures, tracking project commitments in real time during the implementation&#13;
period, and providing the data needed for the generation of project reports, including the&#13;
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR).&#13;
72. An external independent auditor with international experience will be engaged to&#13;
perform the project audits and issue an independent opinion on the project financial&#13;
statements. The external audit report will encompass all project activities and will be in&#13;
accordance with internationally accepted auditing standards. The audit report along with&#13;
the related financial statements should be submitted to the Bank not later than six months&#13;
after the end of each of the project fiscal years.&#13;
73.   All the above activities and procedures will be documented within a chapter of the&#13;
project implementation plan, which will be line with the Master Implementation Manual.&#13;
The project Financial Management arrangements and identified risks are detailed in&#13;
Annex 9.&#13;
74.   Reporting to Donors. The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger&#13;
accounts in respect of the funds deposited by the donors with the Bank under the ITF.&#13;
Within ninety (90) days of the end of each quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30,&#13;
and December 31), the Bank will prepare, on a cash basis, an unaudited statements of&#13;
receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to&#13;
each donor. Each such statement will be expressed in United States Dollars, the currency&#13;
in which the ITF funds will be maintained by the Bank. In addition, within one hundred&#13;
and eighty (180) days of the completion of all disbursements relating to activities&#13;
financed from the ITF, the Bank will prepare on a cash basis an unaudited financial&#13;
statement of receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the ITF and&#13;
forward a copy to each donor.&#13;
75.   The Bank will furnish to the donors:&#13;
a.    on a semi-annual basis, a consolidated report describing the operations of&#13;
the ITF (including contributions, disbursements, and implementation progress) in&#13;
the preceding six months; and&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
b.    on an annual basis, a management assertion, together with an attestation&#13;
from the Bank's external auditors, concerning the adequacy of internal control&#13;
over cash-based financial reporting for trust funds as a whole.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
76.   The project will be limited to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing&#13;
damaged facilities, and as such, it is rated as a category "B" project, as opposed to&#13;
category "A" projects with high environmental impacts. Based on section 13 of OP 4.01,&#13;
exemption has been sought from the World Bank's executive management (March 2004)&#13;
in order that any Environmental Assessment requirements will not be conducted prior to&#13;
project appraisal. Instead, all subprojects will be processed in accordance with the&#13;
Environmental and Social Screening Assessment Framework (ESSAF) for Iraq, which&#13;
was disclosed by the MMPW in October 2004. In addition, a waiver/exceptions to the&#13;
notification requirements under paragraph 7(a) of the policy OP 7.50 has been sought and&#13;
cleared on December 2, 2004. The ESSAF entails that: (a) all subprojects be screened by&#13;
the MMPW through a checklist attached in the ESSAF; (b) that a code of practice be&#13;
included as part of civil work contracts as well as of purchase and installation of&#13;
equipment contracts; (c) that EMPs will be undertaken during project implementation for&#13;
certain components that require due diligence and tight environmental management of&#13;
issues and aspects, particularly component 5, 6, and 7 d) and that capacity building is&#13;
undertaken on the environmental issues and on corrective environmental measures in&#13;
order to enable the MMPW and the Ministry of Environment, to address any potential&#13;
aspects that may arise during the screening and implementation of the components. The&#13;
World Bank. team and the Recipient will be taking the necessary measures to ensure&#13;
compliance with the ESSAF.&#13;
77.   It is anticipated that land acquisition and resettlement will be kept to a minimum&#13;
and all land acquisition and resettlement will be carried out in accordance with these&#13;
guidelines set forth in the ESSAF. Subproject proposals that would require demolishing&#13;
houses or acquiring productive land will be carefully reviewed to minimize or avoid their&#13;
impacts through alternative alignments. Proposals that require more than minor&#13;
expansion along rights of way will be reviewed carefully. No land or asset acquisition&#13;
may take place outside of the ESSAF guidelines. A format for Land Acquisition&#13;
Assessment Data Sheet has also been prepared and is part of the ESSAF (Annex 10).&#13;
PROJECT SUPERVISION&#13;
78.   Considering the unfamiliarity of the Iraqi counterparts with Bank guidelines and&#13;
procedures, strong supervision efforts including frequent field visits would be needed,&#13;
particularly during the early stages of project implementation. Should the security&#13;
situation prevent Bank staff and international consultants from travelling to Iraq during&#13;
project implementation, project supervision would primarily rely on local Iraqi&#13;
consultants and UN partners in Iraq, supported by Bank staff and international&#13;
consultants working from outside Iraq, in the addition to the Monitoring Agents&#13;
mentioned above. Regional consultants with branch offices in Iraq could also be recruited&#13;
to assist with project implementation.&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
79.   Performance indicators for the project have been identified during project&#13;
appraisal and will be measured annually during supervision (annex 11). The MMPW will&#13;
work with consultant(s) to establish a monitoring baseline against which performance can&#13;
be measured. Annual reviews by the MMPW would be carried out to track compliance&#13;
with Grant conditions and highlight lessons from implementation. A mid-term review is&#13;
scheduled for August 2006 and a final project review is scheduled for August 2008 to&#13;
evaluate overall project accomplishments. Furthermore, an independent Monitoring&#13;
Agent will be appointed and funded by the World Bank to assess compliance with the&#13;
Grant Agreement, as stipulated in the Trust Fund Conditions.&#13;
E.       ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATIONS&#13;
80.   An estimated population of more than two million people will benefit from the&#13;
improvement in water and sanitation, and other municipal services made possible by the&#13;
project, which only covers part of the most urgent needs of towns and cities outside&#13;
Baghdad. Length of service and the quality of water will improve. Sewerage currently&#13;
discharged in rivers and streams will be reduced thus lessening the risk of epidemics due&#13;
to waterbome diseases (typhoid, etc.). The project will also help reduce the extensive&#13;
leakages that cause sewerage to infiltrate water supply and will go a long way in&#13;
addressing the problem of protecting the most vulnerable groups in society, which are the&#13;
children and older people.&#13;
81.   In addition, the project will increase the labour productivity by reducing the&#13;
burden of disease of the whole population, regardless of age, and particularly on the&#13;
working population, thereby increasing productivity and raising the standard of living of&#13;
the population and especially that of poor families. This enhances the level of protection&#13;
and reduces the vulnerability of children and older people. To ensure sustainability in a&#13;
troubled context, the project provides for capacity building with the support of&#13;
consultants in accounting, financial management, information systems, billing and&#13;
collection and tariffs. Given the high positive externalities for investments of this type,&#13;
the project is expected to be cost-effective. The economic and financial benefits of this&#13;
project have not been quantified at this stage, as this is an emergency operation (as&#13;
allowed under OP8.50).&#13;

Annex 3: Detailed Projects Description&#13;
&gt; Component 1 - Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Karbala Water and Sewerage&#13;
Systems (Estimated cost of US$16.34 million)&#13;
Karbala, along with Najaf, is the most holy sites and consequently centers for pilgrimage&#13;
for Shia Moslems. This component aims to improve the water and sewerage services for&#13;
Karbala's resident population of about 500,000 inhabitants and its visitors population of 2&#13;
to 3 millions annually. The main objectives of this component are to provide an adequate&#13;
supply of potable water and effective sewerage services to the resident population of&#13;
Karbala including the new, unconnected residence sectors. It will also allow for sufficient&#13;
flexibility in the systems such that adequate services will be maintained to both the resident&#13;
and visiting population during religious days, as well as improve the environmental and&#13;
health conditions by renewing the old water network and sanitation services. Finally, this&#13;
component will contribute to the reduction of water born diseases through the elimination&#13;
of water supply by tankers and the provision of potable water and sanitation networks. The&#13;
infrastructure deficiencies to be rectified by this project are identified as follows:&#13;
* Al-Safi Water Treatment Plant suffers from frequent mechanical and electrical failure&#13;
and accumulation of debris at the raw water intake arising as a result of poor intake&#13;
design.&#13;
* The extent of network bursts and leaks and general poor condition of pipes render it&#13;
difficult and time consuming to operate and maintain.&#13;
* Hay Al-Hussain Water Treatment Plant's sedimentation tanks are corroded and the&#13;
filter building has cavities under the foundations extending to 600m2, which needs&#13;
to be rectified. The chlorinators have suffered from a lack of proper maintenance&#13;
and need to be replaced.&#13;
* The water intake from the Al-Hussainia river requires rehabilitation. Bechtel will&#13;
implement the rehabilitation works.&#13;
* The old shrine area sewer lines (covering Al - Shuhada'a square to Al - Sa'adyia&#13;
pumping station (P3) branch, Al - Alqami street branch and Al - Sidra street&#13;
branch) need rehabilitation.&#13;
The component consists of the rehabilitation of two treatment plants, the distribution&#13;
network, public stand pipes, sewer lines and public hygiene sanitation points, primarily:&#13;
* Rehabilitation of Al - Safi Water Treatment Plant including five water treatment&#13;
units of 200 m3/hr each, high and low lift pumping stations, 400 m3 concrete&#13;
distribution chamber, 2,000 m3 concrete ground storage tank, power building, three&#13;
chlorinators, piping and valves.&#13;
* Rehabilitation of Hay Al-Hussain Water Treatment Plant, including:&#13;
- Rehabilitation of raw water intake (included under Bechtel contract).&#13;

0 Component 2 - Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Majar Water Supply System&#13;
(Estimated cost of US$3.16 million)&#13;
The Majar district in the Maysan governorate has a population of approximately 120,000.&#13;
The villages to be served under this project are Mabroka and Al-Yarmook, which have a&#13;
combined population of about 18,000 and are considered to be two of the poorest villages&#13;
in the Govemorate. The main objective of the proposed component is to supply the 18,000&#13;
inhabitants of the aforementioned villages with potable water. Water for Mabroka and Al-&#13;
Yarmook villages has historically been supplied from their own packaged treatment plants&#13;
but supplies have now significantly fallen short of demand for three reasons:&#13;
- lack of maintenance of the electro-mechanical equipment in the villages (the packaged&#13;
unit and pumps have all ceased to function);&#13;
- rapid expansion of the population without a parallel increase in production and&#13;
distribution capacities of the water treatment facilities and distribution networks;&#13;
36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
- lack of spare parts and consumables.&#13;
The two villages are agricultural villages without adequate sewerage systems. The&#13;
proposed water supply improvement project will increase the per capita water&#13;
consumption and thus will increase the frequency that septic tanks need to be evacuated&#13;
resulting in additional household costs. Improved water supplies to this region are a top&#13;
priority but an adequate sanitation system will also be required in the medium term.&#13;
Recently, the MMPW have prohibited the discharge of untreated sewage into the rivers as&#13;
a step towards reducing the pollution of the rivers.&#13;
The project components consists of supply and installation of two water treatment units,&#13;
distribution networks, pumping stations and about 3,000 house connections for each village&#13;
are as follows:&#13;

The targeted villages to be served under this project are Albu To'ama &amp; Hajaj, which have&#13;
a combined population of about 16,000 inhabitants. These villages are spread out in a&#13;
number of independent rural and agricultural communities and are considered two of the&#13;
poorest villages in the Governorate of Salah Al-Din. This project component will supply&#13;
potable water, while contributing to i- the reduction of water borne diseases by reducing the&#13;
water supply from dirty tankers, and ii, the improvement of the economic condition for the&#13;
population by decreasing the purchase of water from tankers and creating employment&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
The project will serve two villages and simply consists of the following:&#13;

0 Component 8 - Rehabilitation and upgrading of Dohuk Water Supply and&#13;
Sewerage Systems (Estimated total cost of US$4.92 million)&#13;
Over the past 2 years the Governorate of Dohuk has distributed 10,000 plots of land in the&#13;
western sector of the city to poor and displaced families whose villages were destroyed by&#13;
the previous regime. At present, a population of approximately 32,000 lives in the project&#13;
area without any sewage or potable water services. Water fees from private providers&#13;
amount to, on average, US$100 per month, which accounts for about 30% of household&#13;
income. Furthermore, the unhygienic state of the purchased water has led to water borne&#13;
infections which resulted in chronic infections in response to long period and persistent&#13;
exposure to this contaminated water. This component will consist mainly of supplying and&#13;
installing a water distribution network as follows to relieve the existing conditions:&#13;
Ductile iron water distribution network of total length of 5.5 km (uPVC is not&#13;
recommended to be used because of the nature of the rocks in the area). The network will&#13;
be fed from storage tanks with a total capacity of 4,000 m3. The tanks are located at a&#13;
height of 40'm above the households and will be filled through the existing main lines from&#13;
Dohuk WTP.&#13;
* Storm water system 10.5 km long as follows:&#13;
- concrete pipes of diameter 900 mm, total length 9,300m and 352 manholes&#13;
of 1.2 x 1.2m;&#13;

(Estimated cost of US$4.48 million)&#13;
Dukan is one of the main tourist areas in the region whereby thousands of tourists visit it&#13;
on weekends. There is a significant increase in water demand especially during weekends&#13;
and public holidays. The existing water supply system was first constructed back in 1982&#13;
and has been neglected for a long time, and is in urgent need for a total and complete&#13;
rehabilitation. The objective of this component is to increase the access and supply of&#13;
water to parts of Dukan. This component will address all aspects of rehabilitation and&#13;

B.    Assessment of the agencv's capacity to implement procurement&#13;
A preliminary assessment of the procurement capacity of the MMPW has been carried&#13;
out by Hiba Tahboub, Sr. Procurement Specialist. This assessment is based on&#13;
discussions with the MMPW staff in Amman, during the pre-appraisal mission in March&#13;
2004 and the outcomes of an assessment report that was carried out by a consultant&#13;
commissioned by the Bank. Moreover, a brief review of public procurement system in&#13;
Iraq is provided in Appendix 2 of this annex.&#13;
The Ministry has offices in 252 municipalities in fifteen of the eighteen governorates in&#13;
Iraq. The three Govemorates of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, Duhok, Erbil, and&#13;
Sulaimaniyah, are affiliated but administered separately. More than 42,500 employees&#13;
serve in the Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works working at over 680 locations.&#13;
The Directorates General provide administrative, financial and technical support to each&#13;
govemorate and municipality. They are responsible for overseeing distribution systems&#13;
for water, sewerage, and other municipal services. They oversee installation and&#13;
maintenance of water and sewerage treatment facilities. And they also set and oversee the&#13;
standards for design and operations for all municipal services, such as refuse collection,&#13;
municipal roads, cemeteries, abattoirs, and public parks.&#13;
Ministry staff are already busy with projects to rehabilitate existing, or construct new,&#13;
facilities all over the country. The ministry is currently implementing projects financed&#13;
by the Iraqi national budget in the year 2004 ( US$ 220 million) as well as other sizable&#13;
infrastructure projects financed by donors. This reflects that the MMPW is capable of&#13;
implementing all projects financed under the loan using its own staff and facilities. The&#13;
World Bank, however, would work closely with its counterpart team in the Ministry to&#13;
build the knowledge in Bank procurement.&#13;
There is no centralized procurement department in the current organizational structure of&#13;
the MMPW. Procurement is carried out by each Directorate General of the MMPW&#13;
through a specialized unit. International and local procurement are closely coordinated&#13;
with the Departments of Technical and Legal Affairs.&#13;
There are two Central Committees involved in the projects procurement processes in the&#13;
MMPW. The first central committee is responsible for bid opening and chaired by the&#13;
Deputy Minister for Administrative Affairs, and attended by members from the technical&#13;
and legal Departments. The second Central Committee is the Bid evaluation Committee,&#13;
chaired by the Deputy Minister for Technical Affairs and attended by members from&#13;
52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
technical financial and legal departments. Recommendations of both committees should&#13;
be approved by the Minister.&#13;
Procurement activities under the project will be carried out by the Project Management&#13;
Team (PMT) which has been established in MMPW directly reporting to the Minister.&#13;
The PMT will be staffed mainly of MMPW staff who are transferred from their existing&#13;
directorates to work, on a full-time basis, as PMT staff. The PMT will closely coordinate&#13;
its daily activities with the different directorates of the MMPW. It is critical that at least&#13;
two qualified procurement staff members are selected prior to the Grant Agreement&#13;
Signing. These recruits should be trained on and become well-versed in Bank&#13;
procurement procedures within the first three months after Grant Agreement Signing.&#13;
Such training can be obtained through attending formal courses in international&#13;
institutions that delivers training on World Bank procurement procedures.&#13;
The Project will be implemented in ten Governorates. Construction supervision and site&#13;
progress reporting will be the responsibility of the technical implementation unit in each&#13;
Governorate reporting to the PMT. Procurement will be implemented centrally by the&#13;
PMT. The same will apply to the three northern Governorates ( Erbil, Dukan and&#13;
Sulaimania) which report to the Kurdestan Regional Government.&#13;
Given that the procurement environment which prevailed in Iraq during the last two&#13;
decades was more or less different from the norms of acceptable international practice&#13;
and the legal and regulatory changes introduced by the CPA, public procurement will&#13;
predictably bear a high level of risk in the near future. The risk lies essentially in the lack&#13;
of applicable laws and regulations, modern standard documentation, lack of training of&#13;
concerned staff in procurement using World Bank guidelines and international sound&#13;
procurement practice, the lack of law enforcement which would increase the risk of&#13;
looting and the damaging of facilities, and the inability of World Bank procurement staff&#13;
to supervise project in the field.&#13;
On the positive side however, Iraq has a wealth of procurement and engineering staff that&#13;
may be retrained rapidly to operate a reformed procurement system, and use new&#13;
procurement documents and tools as they become available. Eight of the MMPW staff&#13;
have already received two three-week training courses in procurement, financial, and&#13;
project management that were organized by the World Bank staff at the Iraq Interim&#13;
Office in Amman, Jordan.&#13;
Recommendations and Action Plan to Build the Agencies Capacity&#13;
* Two procurement officers will be assigned to the PMT. These two officers will&#13;
receive both formal and ad-hoc procurement training to efficient handling of the&#13;
procurement activities under the project.&#13;
* An international project management firm will be recruited to assist the PMT in&#13;
procurement, financial and project management. This firm would assist MMPW&#13;
in establishing a procurement monitoring and reporting system and introducing.&#13;
* Series of training sessions and workshops will be carried out during appraisal&#13;
throughout project implementation. The target audience would be PMT staff and&#13;
other employees of MMPW.&#13;
* The Master Implementation Manual (MIM), expected to be finalized by the end&#13;
of January 2004, would be adapted to the particular circumstances of the MMPW.&#13;
The MIM will provide standard procurement documents, evaluation reports,&#13;
53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project TechnicalAnnex&#13;
progress reports, filing requirements that would be followed throughout project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
*  The thresholds for prior review by the Bank are set at a low level, to allow World&#13;
Bank staff to provide hands-on training to staff of the PMT.&#13;
*  A Project Launch Workshop would be held in Arabic (or with Arabic translation)&#13;
soon after project effectiveness. All staff involved in implementation should&#13;
attend the workshop and it will be most critical that this staff be assigned on time.&#13;
C.       Procurement Plan&#13;
The MMPW, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation&#13;
which provides the basis for the procurement methods (Appendix 6). This plan has been&#13;
agreed between the World Bank and the PMT on October 6, 2004 and is available at&#13;
PMT office in Baghdad and the World Bank Iraq Interim Office in Amman. It will also&#13;
be available in the Project's database and in the Bank's external website.  The&#13;
Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as&#13;
required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in&#13;
institutional capacity.&#13;
D.     Frequency of Procurement Supervision&#13;
In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the&#13;
capacity assessment of the Implementing Agency has recommended four supervision&#13;
missions per year to visit the field to carry out post review of procurement actions. Until&#13;
security conditions make travel to Iraq possible for Bank staff, the Bank will employ a&#13;
Monitoring Agent, an independent firm, which will operate in Iraq and support the Bank&#13;
in carrying out its supervision function, including spot checks. In addition, the Bank will&#13;
rely on reports from a local procurement consultant that will work for the Bank from&#13;
within Iraq. During the interim period, Bank staff and the concerned Iraqi procurement&#13;
staff will meet outside Iraq to do off-site supervision as well as use of videoconference&#13;
facilities.&#13;

Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
Annex 9: Financial Management and Disbursement&#13;
I.    Summary&#13;
Under the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund, the MMPW, as the implementing agency, is the Grant&#13;
Recipient. The Grant financial resources will be managed by the MMPW within the framework&#13;
of the MMPW financial management system and additional World Bank procurement and&#13;
financial management procedures. The Grant funds will be made available to the MMPW who&#13;
will enter into contractual agreements with contractors, consultants and suppliers for the&#13;
rehabilitation and construction of activities financed under the project.&#13;
In view of the current security situation it has not been possible for WB staff to travel to Iraq.&#13;
In lieu of this, the MMPW financial management assessment was carried out by a regional&#13;
consulting firm. The assessment covered the current financial management system at the&#13;
MMPW in order to identify the risks associated with the control environment, the accounting,&#13;
reporting and auditing procedures in place and proposed actions to reduce and manage such&#13;
risks. This assessment showed that the systems in place at MMPW are based on principles and&#13;
procedures defined by the legal framework and operational decrees applicable to the public&#13;
sector in Iraq. These procedures prepare reports based on budget line expenditures and include&#13;
several layers of routine authorization controls. The assessment described the organization&#13;
structure of the MMPW, the accounting system used, reporting, the internal control procedures,&#13;
and payments control mechanisms. The assessment showed various weaknesses in the control&#13;
system and control environment6. Accordingly, the Bank will introduce additional control&#13;
measures to the project.- The financial management assessment project files include a copy of&#13;
the assessment documentation.&#13;
II.   Financial Management Risk Assessment&#13;
The financial management risk associated with this operation is considered as high. Critical&#13;
risk factors are:  (i) ongoing insecurity, which prevents on-site Bank supervision and&#13;
assessments, including financial management assessments; (ii) the Bank's limited knowledge&#13;
of Iraq's public financial management systems, controls, and procedures; (iii) the limited&#13;
knowledge on the part of Iraqi authorities of Bank policies and guidelines; (iv) the possibility&#13;
of MMPW not making available on a timely basis financial resources to honor payments below&#13;
the value of $10,000; (v) difficult communication and flow of information between worksites&#13;
and the PMT, which could delay payments; (vi) inefficiencies in Iraq's banking system that&#13;
delay payments and transfer of funds to contractors, suppliers, or MMPW; and (vii) variation&#13;
orders that may exceed price contingencies and difficulty may be encountered in verifying&#13;
justification for variation orders. Although the project design mitigates to the extent possible&#13;
these risks, the project will require close monitoring and supervision during implementation.&#13;
A detailed risk assessment is in Section VII.&#13;
6 Special purpose audit on five ministries conducted by qualified audit firm revealed several irregular transactions&#13;
and breaches of the control system of those ministries.&#13;
66&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
III.  Risk Mitigation Measures&#13;
The overall high risk will be partially mitigated by putting in place additional controls and&#13;
procedures.&#13;
The control risk will be partially mitigated by putting in place additional controls and&#13;
procedures, including: (a) the PMT will verify and authorize payments under the project and&#13;
will verify justification for variation orders; (b) the PMT will maintain accounting system for&#13;
the project and retain project's records and supporting documents, (c) a qualified financial&#13;
manager will be appointed for the PMT financed under the Grant, and the PMT will be&#13;
assigned a competent financial officer and finance assistant from MMPW who will be&#13;
supported by a financial management consultant; (d) the Minister will designate an internal&#13;
auditor from the internal audit department of MMPW to track and verify the project financial&#13;
transactions; (e) disbursements by the Bank will be made primarily by direct payments and on&#13;
reimbursement basis supported by full documentation; (f) the Fiduciary Monitoring Agent will&#13;
review project expenditures and Withdrawal Applications; (g) the internal audit department at&#13;
MMPW will maintain ledger account for each contract to track all payments made against each&#13;
contract and avoid overpayment; and (h) close control will be exercised on all project&#13;
documents and payment supporting documents at the PMT.&#13;
The accounting and reporting risks will be managed by putting in place a simple computerized&#13;
system using spreadsheet applications, capable of recording all project expenditures, tracking&#13;
project commitments in real time during the implementation period, and providing the data&#13;
needed for the generation of project reports, including the Financial Monitoring Reports&#13;
(FMR).&#13;
All the above activities and procedures will be documented in a chapter of the project&#13;
implementation plan and will be in line with the Master Implementation Manual&#13;
IV.   Financial Management Arrangements.&#13;
Flow of Information. As per current control regulations all invoices, or work orders will be&#13;
signed and approved by the local technical implementation units in the districts and will be&#13;
remitted to PMT for paymiient under cover letter signed by the manager of the unit. Contracting&#13;
and payment processes will be centralized at the PMT level. The PMT will verify all claims&#13;
and will maintain up-to-date invoices register and general ledger to record all payments&#13;
incurred. The MMPW internal auditor designated to the project by the Minister will perform&#13;
ex-ante checking to all financial transactions.&#13;
Financial Management Procedures. The project procedures and the parallel accounting&#13;
system that are managed by the PMT will be detailed in the project implementation plan in&#13;
order to define the relation between all stakeholders involved with the project implementation&#13;
and facilitate the flow of project information.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
V.    Project Reports&#13;
Project reports should be remitted to the Bank following the agreed format and frequency. The&#13;
proposed format of the reports is in the project files and was agreed upon with the MMPW&#13;
representatives during negotiations.&#13;
Ouarterly Reports: The MMPW will generate Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) and&#13;
submit them to the Bank as part of the project progress report, or separately, within 45 days&#13;
from the end of the quarter. These FMRs include two sections:&#13;
* Financial Reports will include a cash flow statement, beginning and ending project&#13;
cash balances and an expenditure report by activity or contract comparing actual and&#13;
planned expenditures. Also, a narrative report explaining major variances when&#13;
compared to plan and the proposed corrective actions should be included as an annex to&#13;
the financial reports.&#13;
* Contracts Reports will include information on the major rehabilitation and&#13;
construction contracts, showing contract financial status against plan, including&#13;
information on all authorized contract variations.&#13;
These reports should be remitted to the Bank within 45 days from the end of the period. The&#13;
proposed format of the reports is in the project files and will be agreed upon with the MMPW&#13;
representatives during negotiations.&#13;
Annual Reports: Audited Project Financial Statements that will be submitted to the Bank no&#13;
later than six months after the end of the fiscal year, include:&#13;
1. Statement of sources and utilization of funds, indicating funds received and&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
2. Appropriate schedules classifying project activities, showing cumulative balances.&#13;
3. Statement of payments made using SOEs procedures, if allowed later by the Bank, as&#13;
defined in the legal agreement.&#13;
Renortin! To Donors. The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts in&#13;
respect of the funds deposited by the donors with the Bank under the ITF. Within ninety (90)&#13;
days of the end of each quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31), the&#13;
Bank will prepare, on a cash basis, an unaudited statements of receipts, disbursements, and&#13;
fund balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to each donor. Each such statement&#13;
will be expressed in United States Dollars, the currency in which the ITF funds will be&#13;
maintained by the Bank. In addition, within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the&#13;
completion of all disbursements relating to activities financed from the ITF, the Bank will&#13;
prepare on a cash basis an unaudited financial statement of receipts, disbursements, and fund&#13;
balance with respect to the ITF and forward a copy to each donor.&#13;
The Bank will furnish to the donors:&#13;
68&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
a.    on a semi-annual basis, a consolidated report describing the operations of the&#13;
ITF (including contributions, disbursements, and implementation progress) in the&#13;
preceding six months; and&#13;
b.    on an annual basis, a management assertion, together with an attestation from&#13;
the Bank's external auditors, concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-&#13;
based financial reporting for trust funds as a whole.&#13;
VI.   Auditing Arrangements&#13;
An external independent auditor with international experience will be engaged to perform the&#13;
project audit and issue an independent opinion on the project financial statements. The&#13;
external audit report will encompass all of the Project's activities and will be presented in&#13;
accordance with internationally accepted auditing standards. MMPW will remit a project audit&#13;
report to the Bank not later than six months after year end. The auditor selection process will&#13;
be launched directly after the Grant Agreement is signed. In addition to the audit reports, the&#13;
auditor will prepare a "management letter" identifying any observations, comments, and&#13;
deficiencies in the system and controls that the auditor considers pertinent, and will provide&#13;
recommendations for their improvements. The audit will cover the expenditures made through&#13;
direct payments as well as expenditures reimbursed to the MMPW in terms of their&#13;
substantiation and their eligibility and compliance with the Grant Agreement. An escrow&#13;
account will be used to pay the auditor after the project closing date.&#13;
VII.  Disbursement Arrangements and Associated Risk&#13;
The Grant of US$90 million is expected to be disbursed by August 31, 2007. The Bank's&#13;
strategy in Iraq is to ensure Iraqi ownership and strengthen institutional capacity by financing&#13;
operations that are implemented by Iraqi ministries and other recipient entities. Trained PMTs&#13;
will facilitate implementation and help ensure compliance with fiduciary and other safeguards.&#13;
PMTs will be employed and paid by the implementing entity at regular salary levels, thereby&#13;
avoiding the disadvantages of stand-alone Project Implementation Units that can erode civil&#13;
service institutional capacity over the medium and long term. The project will finance&#13;
specialized technical support in procurement, financial management, and other areas as needed.&#13;
In addition, to ensure that project funds are used for the purposes intended and to help carry out&#13;
project supervision, the World Bank will employ two independent firms as Monitoring Agents.&#13;
As a further compensating control, disbursements will be made primarily by direct payment by&#13;
the Bank to the contractors, consultants, and vendors. Once authorized by the MMPW, direct&#13;
payments will be made by the World Bank directly into the account of the contractor,&#13;
consultant, or vendor in a commercial bank capable of receiving funds transferred from the&#13;
international banking system.&#13;
The project management component costs and payments below the threshold of US$10,000&#13;
normally will be made through payments by the Recipient from its own resources. These&#13;
payments made from the Recipient's own resources will be reimbursed, on a periodic basis, by&#13;
the World Bank to the MMPW upon presentation of proof of payment and a signed withdrawal&#13;

applications. The PMT and the main financial counterparts from the MMPW will be subject to&#13;
intensive training in the Bank's disbursement procedures.&#13;
Use of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Initially supporting documentation will be&#13;
provided to the Bank for all requests to disburse funds under the Grant. The Bank has the&#13;
option to allow expenditures under US$10,000 to be made by means of Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs). If SOEs are allowed the supporting documentation will be maintained at&#13;
the PMT of MMPW and made available for review by Bank representatives upon request; any&#13;
documentation relating to SOEs will be retained for up to one year from the date the Bank&#13;
receives the second Grant audit report.&#13;

Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
Annex 10: Environmental and Social Safeguards Assessment Framework (ESSAF)&#13;
A) Introduction and Purpose of ESSAF&#13;
The purpose of this Framework is to assist the Project Implementing Agency (The Ministry&#13;
of Municipalities and Public Works, Republic of Iraq) in screening all the subprojects for&#13;
their likely social and environmental impacts, detailing the required measures for their&#13;
proper implementation and monitoring.&#13;
This project specific ESSAF draws from the generic and overarching framework agreed&#13;
upon with the Government of Iraq for all reconstruction and rehabilitation projects to be&#13;
implemented on an emergency basis, and is especially tailored to the specific issues&#13;
identified for the proposed intervention.&#13;
The Project, Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project aims at restoring&#13;
basic water supply, sanitation and urban services for urban areas outside the capital city of&#13;
Baghdad through:&#13;
(a)   carrying out reconstruction and rehabilitation of existing facilities and&#13;
(b)   providing capacity building support through training and technical assistance.&#13;
This project also aims to improve the existing environmental and health conditions by&#13;
renewing the old water networks and sanitation services. It will also contribute to the&#13;
reduction of water borne diseases through the reduction of water supply by tankers and the&#13;
provision of potable water and sanitation networks. This would also help improve the&#13;
economic conditions of the population by reducing the amounts of water obtained from&#13;
tankers, which is generally more expensive. The project will complement support by other&#13;
donors. The project will also create vitally needed short-term employment and help build&#13;
Iraq's capacity to manage large-scale reconstruction.&#13;
Project components and their estimated costs are summarized below:&#13;
&gt; Component 1 - Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Karbala Water and Sewerage&#13;
Systems (Estimated cost of US$16.34 million)&#13;

and, (iv) construction of a new storm water drainage network.&#13;
&gt; Component 13 - Capacity Building and Technical Assistance&#13;
(Estimated total cost of US$ 4.00 million)&#13;
This project will improve the quality of life of more than 2 million Iraqi citizens. Nevertheless,&#13;
the needs remain quite high. The UN/WB Joint Needs Assessment estimated at US$6.8 billion&#13;
the total rehabilitation needs of the Water Supply and Sanitation sector and at US$384 million&#13;
of the Urban Management sector. Based on these figures, this project will contribute to less&#13;
than 1% and about 8% of the total needs, respectively.&#13;
B) Safeguards Assessment&#13;
This operation will be implemented in compliance with the following applicable Safeguards&#13;
Policies of the World Bank as well as the Emergency Recovery Loan Policy of the Bank (O.P.&#13;
8.50).&#13;
OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment. Most of the proposed subprojects are likely to focus on&#13;
the repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction and upgrading (where necessary) of priority networks and&#13;
treatment facilities. The work in these areas will be done in compliance with the World Bank&#13;
Environmental Assessment Safeguards Policy (OP 4.01).&#13;
Considering the nature and magnitude of potential environmental impacts of rehabilitation and&#13;
reconstruction works, the proposed operations are classified as category 'B'. For subprojects with&#13;
potential adverse impacts, a limited Environmental Management Plan (EMP) will be done during&#13;
project implementation (in compliance with O.P 4.01 in the case of emergency operations as defined by&#13;
75&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
Emergency Recovery Loan Policy 8.50), particularly if new water supply and sewer systems are built&#13;
and when dealing with chlorination units. TORs applying to water and sanitation projects attached to&#13;
this document will have to be followed. For the rest of the subprojects with limited potential adverse&#13;
impacts and prior to appraisal, the implementing agency will agree to apply the following minimum&#13;
standards during implementation:&#13;
o  completing the check list in attachment 2; 2) consider attachment 3 if applicable; 3)&#13;
inclusion of standard environmental code of practice (ECOP) for water and wastewater&#13;
in the repair and reconstruction bid documents of all subprojects; 4) review and&#13;
oversight of any major reconstruction works by specialists; 5) implementation of&#13;
environmentally and socially sound options for disposal of debris; and 6) provisions for&#13;
adequate budget and satisfactory institutional arrangements for monitoring effective&#13;
implementation.&#13;
o  One of the subprojects, namely the design of a New Municipal Slaughterhouse, will be&#13;
the subject of a full Environmental Impact Assessment study (component 10 Kerbala).&#13;
Another subproject, component 7 Arbil, 10 water wells will be drilled to 300 m and the&#13;
subproject will protect existing water wells. This would be evidenced by an EMP (at&#13;
least, if not by an EIA).&#13;
o  The issue of solid wastes, particularly of demolition wastes, will have to be researched.&#13;
All the cities under this project are loaded with solid wastes problems that go back&#13;
many years and that include many types of wastes: hazardous, municipal and&#13;
hospital/health care wastes. These wastes will be augmented by new demolition wastes&#13;
from the subprojects and will compound the issue. This Project will have to deal with&#13;
the issue at a collective level. Solutions are not easy at this stage: setting up new semi-&#13;
structured landfills; using and upgrading existing dumps to an acceptable level and&#13;
recycling the demolition/construction wastes by using appropriate technology&#13;
(rudimentary unit that converts large chunks of debris to powder-like "wastes" that&#13;
may be re-used/ recycled). During Project negotiations plans to build solid waste&#13;
landfills have been mentioned by the Iraqi delegation.&#13;
OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement. The need for involuntary resettlement or land acquisition&#13;
in specific subproject areas will only be known during project implementation, when site-specific plans&#13;
are available. In the above sub projects, it might be that acquisition of linear stretches of land is&#13;
necessary for the construction of new sewer lines. Therefore, subprojects will be screened for triggering&#13;
of the resettlement policy. Any subprojects involving involuntary resettlement or land acquisition will&#13;
only be approved after preparation of a resettlement plan acceptable to the Bank. The safeguards&#13;
framework will therefore include procedures for identifying people who will be affected by the sub-&#13;
projects and for proper determination of appropriate compensation.&#13;
OP 11.03 Cultural Property. Operations may pose limited risks of damaging cultural&#13;
property in the cities targeted by the sub-projects namely the sacred city of Karbala and the touristic&#13;
city of Dukan, particularly if excavations are required, but assuming that they will not include large-&#13;
scale excavations, movement of earth or demolition. Nevertheless, projects and subprojects will be&#13;
reviewed for their potential impact on cultural property and clear procedures will be required for&#13;
identification, protection of cultural property from theft, and treatment of discovered artifacts, and will&#13;
be included in standard bidding documents. Even in the case cultural property is not damaged by the&#13;
project activities, identification of later assistance for the preservation of historic or archeological sites&#13;
might be carried out. If these opportunities occur, cultural property management plans following the&#13;
application of chance find procedures would be prepared for those subprojects.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
OP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways. Because the Project will be drawing on&#13;
the intake of water from both the Tigris and the Euphrates and their tributaries therefore OP&#13;
7.50 has been triggered. However, the team has determined after deliberations and discussions&#13;
that the Project falls within the exceptions to the notification requirements under Paragraph 7&#13;
(a) of the policy. The team has obtained a no objection from the RVP. Components affecting&#13;
the Tigris and Euphrates waters will be screened in checklist attachment 2 to identify&#13;
environmental issues, particularly for components 5 and 6. Decisions on actions and&#13;
requirements will be made with the concurrence of the Bank.&#13;
IV.    Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
The selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation of subprojects will be consistent&#13;
with the following guidelines, codes of practice and requirements.&#13;
* A list of negative characteristics rendering a proposed subproject ineligible for support&#13;
(Attachment 1);&#13;
*: A proposed checklist of likely environment and social impacts to be filled out for each&#13;
subproject or group of subprojects (Attachment 2);&#13;
* Guidelines for land and asset acquisition, entitlements and compensation(Attachment 3);&#13;
*: Procedures for the protection of cultural property, including the chance discovery of&#13;
archaeological artifacts, unrecorded graveyards and burial sites(Attachment 4);&#13;
*: Relevant elements of the codes of practice for the prevention and mitigation of potential&#13;
environmental impacts (Attachment 5); and&#13;
* A sample Environmental Safeguards procedures as a basis for additional requirement to the&#13;
Contracts Technical Specifications (Attachment 6).&#13;
* An EMP for sub projects identified as having adverse impacts and affecting a large number&#13;
of people (more than 10.000) for which TORs are included with the ESSAF is to be carried&#13;
out by an independent consultant., Note that the EMP will have to be prepared prior to&#13;
construction (Attachment 7).&#13;
* An Environmental Impact Assessment for component 10, the slaughterhouse, will be&#13;
performed as this subproject is a category A.&#13;
* Attachment 8 in case solid waste issues emerge and need attention and studying, the&#13;
category of which will have to be determined prior to construction and based on&#13;
estimates of quantities and impacts.&#13;
V.     Responsibilities for Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
The Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works will act as the implementation agency&#13;
responsible for applying the safeguard screening and mitigation requirements to its own subprojects. A&#13;
Safeguards Focal Point (SFP) will be identified in the Ministry with responsibility for overseeing the&#13;
implementation of the Framework.&#13;

VI.    Capacity-Building and Monitoring of Safeguard Framework Implementation&#13;
As part of the capacity-building to be provided for implementation of the proposed operations,&#13;
the Safeguards Focal Points and relevant staff of the concerned Ministry and Municipalities will also&#13;
receive training in ESSAF's application.&#13;
To assist in this capacity-building, and to provide subsequent guidance and review of the&#13;
ESSAF's application, the World Bank and the Iraqi government will contract an international&#13;
monitoring agency for the monitoring and supervision of the safeguards. During supervision of these&#13;
operations, the World Bank will assess the implementation of the ESSAF, and recommend additional&#13;
strengthening, if required.&#13;
VII.   Consultation and Disclosure&#13;
This ESSAF will be shared with the different stakeholders, with the concerned&#13;
nongovernmental organizations and with participating development partners. It would be disclosed in&#13;
Arabic and English by the Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works (proponent) and will be made&#13;
available at the World Bank's InfoShop around and after appraisal in October 2004. Relevant&#13;
subproject specific safeguard documents/mitigation plans prepared subsequently will also be disclosed.&#13;
A letter from the Ministry to the Bank will authorize disclosure through the Bank's InfoShop and will&#13;
specify the modalities of disclosure in-country.&#13;
The proposed operations will support a number of feasibility and detailed design studies for future&#13;
infrastructure investments for which World Bank safeguard policies relating to consultation and&#13;
disclosure may apply.&#13;

Attachment 3&#13;
Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition, Entitlements and Compensation&#13;
I.     Objectives&#13;
I.    Resettlement and land acquisition will be kept to a minimum, and will be carried out in&#13;
accordance with these guidelines. Subproject proposals that would require demolishing houses or&#13;
acquiring productive land should be carefully reviewed to minimize or avoid their impacts through&#13;
alternative alignments. Proposals that require more than minor expansion along rights of way should be&#13;
carefully reviewed. No land or asset acquisition may take place outside of these guidelines. A format&#13;
for a Land Acquisition Assessment Data Sheet is attached as Attachment 3(i).&#13;
2.     These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate negatively affected persons&#13;
to ensure that they will be assisted to improve, or at least to restore, their living standards, income&#13;
earning or production capacity to pre-project levels regardless of their land tenure status.&#13;
II.    Categorization&#13;
3.     Based on the number of persons that may be affected by the project, Project Affected People&#13;
(PAPs) and the magnitude of impacts, projects will be categorized as follows:&#13;
(a) Projects that will affect more than 200 PAPs due to land acquisition and/or physical&#13;
relocation and where a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must be produced. If the RAP&#13;
cannot be prepared prior to project appraisal, a waiver can be provided by the World Bank&#13;
Managing Director (MD) in consultation with the Resettlement Committee. In such cases,&#13;
the TT should agree with the Borrower on a timetable for preparation of the RAP.&#13;
(b) Projects that will affect less than 200 persons require the following documentation: (i) a&#13;
land acquisition assessment, (ii) the minutes or record of consultations which assess&#13;
the compensation claimed and agreement reached, and (iii) a record of the receipt of&#13;
the compensation, or voluntary donation, by those affected (see below).&#13;
(c) Projects that are not expected to have any land acquisition or any other significant adverse&#13;
social impacts; on the contrary, significant positive social impact and improved livelihoods&#13;
are expected from such interventions.&#13;
III.   Eligibility&#13;
4.     PAPs are identified as persons whose livelihood is directly affected by the project due to&#13;
acquisition of the land owned or used by them. PAPs deemed eligible for compensation are:&#13;
(a) those who have formnal legal rights to land, water resources or structures/buildings,&#13;
including recognized customary and traditional rights;&#13;
(b) those who do not have such formal legal rights but have a claim to usufruct rights rooted in&#13;
customary law; and&#13;
(c) those whose claim to land and water resources or building/structures do not fall within (a)&#13;
and (b) above, are eligible to resettlement assistance to restore their livelihood.&#13;
84&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
IV.    Acquisition of Productive Assets and Compensation&#13;
5.     PAPs are eligible for replacement costs for lost assets as described below:&#13;
(a) Voluntary contributions. Individuals may elect to voluntarily contribute land or assets&#13;
provided the persons making such contributions do so willingly and are informed that they&#13;
have the right to refuse such contributions; and&#13;
(b) Contributions against compensation. A contributor/asset loser considered "affected" will&#13;
be eligible for compensation and other necessary assistance.&#13;
6.     Voluntary contribution should be clearly documented to confirm the voluntary nature of the&#13;
transition. The documentation should specify that the land is free of any squatters, encroachers or other&#13;
claims. A format is shown in Attachment 3(i), which includes a Schedule for assessing any&#13;
compensation claimed and the agreement reached.&#13;
V.     Compensation Principles&#13;
7.     The project implementation agencies will ensure timely provision of the following means of&#13;
compensation to affected peoples:&#13;
(a) Project affected peoples losing access to a portion of their land or other productive assets&#13;
with the remaining assets being economically viable are entitled to compensation at a&#13;
replacement cost for that portion of land or assets lost to them. Compensation for the lost&#13;
assets will be made according to the following principles:&#13;
(i)  replacement land with an equally productive plot, cash or other equivalent productive&#13;
assets;&#13;
(ii)  materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures that will be demolished;&#13;
(iii) replacement of damaged or lost crops and trees, at market value;&#13;
(iv) other acceptable in-kind compensation;&#13;
(v)  in case of cash compensation, the delivery of compensation should be made in&#13;
public, i.e., at the Community Meeting; and&#13;
(vi) in case of physical relocation, provision of civic infrastructure at the resettlement&#13;
sites.&#13;
(b) Project affected peoples losing access to a portion of their land or other economic assets&#13;
rendering the remainder economically non-viable will have the options of compensation for&#13;
the entire asset by provision of alternative land, cash or equivalent productive asset,&#13;
according to the principles in (a) i-iv above.&#13;
VI.    Consultation Process&#13;
8.     The implementing agencies will ensure that all occupants of land and owners of assets located&#13;
in a proposed subproject area are consulted. Community meetings will be held in each affected district&#13;
85&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
and village to inform the local population of their rights to compensation and options available in&#13;
accordance with these Guidelines. The Minutes of the community meetings shall reflect the discussions&#13;
held, agreements reached, and include details of the agreement, based on the format provided in&#13;
Attachment 3(ii).&#13;
9.     The implementing agency shall provide a copy of the Minutes to affected people and confirm in&#13;
discussions with each of them, their requests and preferences for compensation, agreements reached,&#13;
and any eventual complaint. Copies will be recorded in the posted project documentation and be&#13;
available for inspection during supervision.&#13;
Subproject Approval&#13;
10.   In the event that a subproject involves acquisition against compensation, the implementing&#13;
agency shall:&#13;
(a) not approve the subproject unless satisfactory compensation has been agreed between the&#13;
affected person and the local community; and&#13;
(b) not allow works to start until the compensation has been delivered in a satisfactory manner&#13;
to the affected persons.&#13;
Complaints and Grievances&#13;
11.   Initially, all complaints should be negotiated to reach an agreement at the local&#13;
community/village/district level. If this fails, complaints and grievances on these Guidelines,&#13;
implementation of the agreements recorded in the Community Meeting Minutes or any alleged&#13;
irregularity in carrying out the project can also be addressed by the affected peoples or their&#13;
representative at the municipal or district level. If this also fails, the complaint may be submitted to the&#13;
relevant implementing agency for consideration.&#13;
Verification&#13;
12.   The Community Meeting Minutes, including agreements of compensation and evidence of&#13;
compensation made shall be provided to the Municipality/district, to the supervising engineers, who&#13;
will maintain a record hereof, and to auditors and socio-economic monitors when they undertake&#13;
reviews and post-project assessment. This process shall be specified in all relevant project documents,&#13;
including details of the relevant authority for complaints at the municipal/district or implementing&#13;
agency level.&#13;

Protection of Cultural Property&#13;
1.    Cultural property include monuments, structures, works of art, or sites of significance points of&#13;
view, and are defined as sites and structures having archaeological, historical, architectural, or religious&#13;
significance, and natural sites with cultural values. This includes cemeteries, graveyards and graves.&#13;
2.     The initial phase of the proposed emergency reconstruction operations pose limited risks of&#13;
damaging cultural property since subprojects will largely consist of small investments in community&#13;
infrastructure and income generating activities, reconstruction of existing structures, and minor public&#13;
works. Further, the list of negative subproject attributes, which would make a subproject ineligible for&#13;
support (Attachment 1), includes any activity that would adversely impact cultural property.&#13;
Nevertheless, the following procedures for identification, protection from theft, and treatment of&#13;
discovered artifacts should be followed and included in standard bidding documents as provided in&#13;
Attachment 6.&#13;
Chance Find Procedures&#13;
3.     Chance find procedures will be used as follows:&#13;
(a) Stop the construction activities in the area of the chance find;&#13;
(b) Delineate the discovered site or area;&#13;
(c) Secure the site to prevent any damage or loss of removable objects. In cases of removable&#13;
antiquities or sensitive remains, a night guard shall be present until the responsible local&#13;
authorities and the Ministry of Culture take over;&#13;
(d) Notify the supervisory Engineer who in turn will notify the responsible local authorities&#13;
and the Ministry of Culture immediately (within 24 hours or less);&#13;
(e) Responsible local authorities and the Ministry of Culture would be in charge of protecting&#13;
and preserving the site before deciding on subsequent appropriate procedures. This would&#13;
require a preliminary evaluation of the findings to be performed by the archeologists of the&#13;
Ministry of Culture (within 72 hours). The significance and importance of the findings&#13;
should be assessed according to the various criteria relevant to cultural heritage; those&#13;
include the aesthetic, historic, scientific or research, social and economic values;&#13;
(f) Decisions on how to handle the finding shall be taken by the responsible authorities and the&#13;
Ministry of Culture. This could include changes in the layout (such as when finding an&#13;
irremovable remain of cultural or archeological importance) conservation, preservation,&#13;
restoration and salvage;&#13;
(g) Implementation for the authority decision concerning the management of the finding shall&#13;
be communicated in writing by the Ministry of Culture; and&#13;
(h) Construction work could resume only after permission is given from the responsible local&#13;
authorities and the Ministry of Culture concerning safeguard of the heritage.&#13;
4.     These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions in construction contracts, when&#13;
applicable, and as proposed in section 1.5 of Attachment 6. During project supervision, the Site&#13;
Engineer shall monitor the above regulations relating to the treatment of any chance find encountered&#13;
are observed.&#13;

Attachment 7&#13;
TOR Preparation: Key Issues and Output - Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
(particularly useful for components/activities that require separate EMPs)&#13;
Required Expertise&#13;
1. The consulting team should have:&#13;
* General EA experience;&#13;
*  Environmental specialists;&#13;
2. And expertise in the following areas:&#13;
*  hydrology;&#13;
*  environmental engineering;&#13;
* water quality modeling;&#13;
* ecology (terrestrial, aquatic, and possibly marine depending on receiving environment);&#13;
* water quality;&#13;
* soil science (for land application of sludge);&#13;
* wastewater utility management; and&#13;
* social assessment and public participation.&#13;
3. Other specialties that may be needed, depending on the nature of the project, are public health,&#13;
agronomy, land use planning, oceanography and resource economics.&#13;
Key Issues&#13;
1. It is important to note that projects in this sector could range from the very large, such as the&#13;
development or rehabilitation of a city water supply/distribution system and wastewater&#13;
collection/treatment system, to smaller scale, targeted improvements to existing systems or construction&#13;
of a new municipal wastewater treatment plant. The scope and number of issues involved will depend&#13;
to a great extent on the magnitude and complexity of the project.&#13;
1. Key issues in Iraq for an EA in this sector will include:&#13;
Land Use and Siting&#13;
*  Water treatment and wastewater treatment plants facilities require tracts of land for treatment&#13;
facilities, storage, offices and laboratories, and access roads.&#13;
*   Smaller dispersed plots may be required for peripheral pumping stations.&#13;
*  Elevation relative to the municipality is often a key siting factor to optimize gravity flow and&#13;
reduce or minimize reliance on pumps.&#13;
*   Suitable land is often a limited resource, and facility location could require resettlement of both&#13;
titled landowners and squatters and/or the taking of agricultural land.&#13;
*  Potential impacts of wastewater treatment plant on local communities including odor and reduction&#13;
in property values.&#13;
99&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
Water Resources&#13;
* The population of the IRAQ region is growing rapidly, and the primary sources of water in this arid&#13;
and semi-arid region are non-renewable fossil aquifers.&#13;
* Allocation: exploitation of an aquifer for municipal supply may necessitate use restrictions on&#13;
other users.&#13;
* It is essential to control and prevent further contamination of freshwater water resources (ground&#13;
and surface water) through discharge of untreated or inadequately treated domestic, municipal and&#13;
industrial wastewater.&#13;
* Equally important is the conservation of scarce water resources through demand side management&#13;
and efficient allocation and use of water.&#13;
* Pollution of coastal waters by domestic, municipal and industrial wastewater is also a serious&#13;
problem.&#13;
* Water re-use for agriculture (the reader is recommended to the World Health Organization's&#13;
(WHO) publication Health guidelines for the use of wastewater in agriculture and aquaculture&#13;
(WHO Technical Report Series, No. 778, 1989).&#13;
Socio-economic&#13;
* Demand side management of water supplies will typically involve pricing increases, and&#13;
willingness/ability to pay for the poorer segments of society will likely be an issue.&#13;
* In some countries, the poorer segments of the populace prefer to continue using contaminated water&#13;
to avoid the costs of associated with treated water.&#13;
* Similarly, cost recovery for wastewater treatment services may adversely impact the poorer&#13;
segments of the society.&#13;
Public Health&#13;
* Contamination of potable water by domestic and industrial effluent is common place in many&#13;
countries of the region.&#13;
* Municipal wastewater contamination causes high incidences of illness and death from water borne&#13;
diseases including dysentery and cholera.&#13;
* Industrial wastewater contributes toxic or harmful contaminants including oil and grease, heavy&#13;
metals, acids and PCBs.&#13;
* Agricultural sources contribute fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides.&#13;
* Sludge management and disposal.&#13;
Public Consultation&#13;
* Public consultation has not traditionally been strong in the IRAQ region. It is important that EA for&#13;
all projects take the necessary measures to ensure adequate public consultation.&#13;
* Gender and communication issues must be carefully considered and incorporated in the design of&#13;
public consultation exercises and in the dissemination of project information.&#13;

2. The general requirements for the above are described in the introduction to this chapter (for&#13;
additional details see the World Bank's OP/BP/GP 4.01 - Environmental Assessment at the World&#13;
Bank). Specific aspects under the above components of the EA that should be addressed in an EA of a&#13;
water supply and sanitation project are described below.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
Boxl    Key Output for EA of Water Supply and Sanitation Project&#13;
Policy, Legal, and   Tables should be used to list applicable standards and note which authorities are responsible for their&#13;
Administrative       application. Where there are no relevant local standards, suitable intemational norms may be used.&#13;
Framework:           The World Bank's General Environmental Guidelines, which would apply to projects of this type, are&#13;
provided in Annex JI1.&#13;
Specifically, the TOR should describe the pertinent regulations and standards governing&#13;
environmental quality, pollutant discharges to surface waters and land, industrial discharges to public&#13;
sewers, water reclamation and reuse, agricultural and landscape use of sludge, health and safety,&#13;
protection of sensitive areas, protection of endangered species, siting, land use control, etc., at&#13;
international, national, regional and local levels (The TOR should specify those that are known and&#13;
require the consultant to investigate for others).&#13;
Project Objectives   This section should describe the need for and target consumer of the water network in the context of&#13;
and Description:     the local and national water supply and sanitation strategy. The effect on economic and social&#13;
development goals of the locality, country and region should be described. If the project is an element&#13;
of an overall sanitation program in the area, then a description of the other program elements must be&#13;
presented.&#13;
A physical and engineering description of the project should be provided including at least the&#13;
following:&#13;
* Location&#13;
* water supply source&#13;
* general layout (e.g. distribution and/or collection systems, pumping stations, treatment works,&#13;
intakes and outfalls)&#13;
* unit process description and diagram&#13;
* size in terms of population and population equivalents, present and projected&#13;
* number and types of connected industries&#13;
* anticipated influent and effluent characteristics&#13;
* pre-construction and construction activities&#13;
* schedule, staffing and support facilities and services&#13;
* operation and maintenance activities&#13;
* required off-site investments&#13;
* life span&#13;
Baseline Data        The key categories of data needed for a water supply and sanitation EA include the following:&#13;
Physical Environment&#13;
* geology (general description for overall study area and details for land application sites)&#13;
* topography&#13;
* soils (general description for overall study area and details for land application sites);&#13;
* monthly average temperatures, (rainfall) and runoff characteristics&#13;
* description of receiving waters (identity of streams, lakes, or marine waters; annual average&#13;
discharge or current data by month, chemical quality; existing discharges or withdrawals).&#13;
102&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
Baseline Data&#13;
continued....         Biological Environment&#13;
* Terrestrial communities in areas affected by construction facility siting land application or&#13;
disposal;&#13;
* Aquatic, estuarine or marine communities in affected waters;&#13;
* Rare or endangered species;&#13;
* Sensitive habitats, including parks or preserves, significant natural sites;&#13;
* Species of commercial importance in land application sites and receiving waters.&#13;
Socio-cultural Environment&#13;
* Present water and sanitation system&#13;
* Relevant public health data&#13;
* Present and projected population;&#13;
* Present land use;&#13;
* Planned development activities;&#13;

* Present and projected employment by industrial category;&#13;
* Distribution of income, goods and services;&#13;
* Recreation;&#13;
* Public health;&#13;
* Cultural properties; indigenous. peoples; customs, aspirations and attitudes.&#13;
Baseline data is often only partially available, though many countries will have a large part of these&#13;
data and inexpensive field investigations can provide much of the remainder. Where more detailed&#13;
information is required (if significant effects on an important natural or cultural resource are&#13;
anticipated, for example) there will often be studies on local areas done by international agencies.&#13;
There may also be unpublished information in government departments, universities, PhD theses, or&#13;
voluntary groups. These should be investigated and used where relevant, provided that the sources,&#13;
and any assumptions or uncertainties in the data are documented.&#13;
Environmental        A prediction of the changes in the environment resulting from project construction and operation are&#13;
Impacts:             to be considered, and an assessment of the effect on the surrounding physical, biological, and human&#13;
systems, should be presented. The assessment should pay particular attention to:&#13;
* the extent to which receiving water quality standards and/or other beneficial use objectives will be&#13;
achieved with the proposed type and level of treatment.&#13;
* The length of stream or expanse of lake or marine waters which will be positively or negatively&#13;
affected by the discharge, and the magnitude of the changes in water quality parameters.&#13;
* Projected quantitative changes in beneficial uses, such as fisheries (species composition,&#13;
productivity), recreation and tourism (visitor-days, overnights, expenditures), and waters available&#13;
for portable supply, irrigation, and industrial use.&#13;
* Sanitation and public benefits anticipated.&#13;
* Wastewater re-use for agriculture&#13;

Management Plan      construction and operational phases of the project. The EMP will need to account for monitoring of&#13;
environmental parameters and the influence of mitigation measures on environmental impacts. It&#13;
should include the following basic components.&#13;
Institutional Component&#13;
* Institutional responsibilities for management of the water supply and sanitation sector&#13;
* Responsibilities for monitoring, reporting and enforcement&#13;
* Identification of any needs for capacity building, training or equipment&#13;

Environmental        Environmental Monitoring Component&#13;
Management Plan      Monitoring should ascertain compliance with agreed standards of potable water supply and/or effluent&#13;
discharge, and serve as an analytical support tool for achieving optimal operational performance. The&#13;
World Bank's General Environmental Guidelines, which would apply to projects of this type, are&#13;
provided in Annex 111. A listing of typical monitoring paramneters and frequencies for a wastewater&#13;
treatment plant are presented in Table 1. 7.2 to provide a general picture. Monitoring parameters and&#13;
frequencies for an actual situation are dependent on numerous factors including treatment&#13;
technologies, quality of influent, etc and should be determined on a case by case basis. Monitoring&#13;
parameters and frequencies for potable water are not provided herein due to similar complexities. The&#13;
reader is referred to the World Health Organization's Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality (1996)&#13;
for further information.&#13;
In cases where the wastewater is to be re-used for irrigation agriculture, the WHO's Health guidelines&#13;
for the use of wastewater in agriculture and aquaculture (Technical Report Series No. 778, 1989) are&#13;
recommended for monitoring parameters and guidelines.&#13;

TOR Preparation: Key Issues and Output - Solid Waste Management&#13;
(might be required when dealing with issues of solid wastes/construction wastes)&#13;
Required Expertise&#13;
1. A consulting team will be required with:&#13;
* General EA experience;&#13;
* Environmental specialists;&#13;
2. And expertise in the following areas:&#13;
* solid waste management environmental issues including collection, transport, recycling, disposal&#13;
and composting;&#13;
* landfill leachate and groundwater pollution control and management;&#13;
* facility siting and traffic issues;&#13;
* air pollution control;&#13;
* noise specialists; and&#13;
* social specialists social assessment and public participation.&#13;
Key Issues&#13;
1. EA is generally required for new construction or major upgrading of solid waste management&#13;
facilities. Key EA issues for solid waste management projects typically include the following.&#13;
Land Use and Siting&#13;
* solid waste management facilities require land for access roads, waste handling, disposal and&#13;
associated facilities and operating efficiency is enhanced when the disposal site is proximal to the&#13;
source of waste&#13;
* proximity to city center is often a key siting factor to minimize haul time, transfer stations, and&#13;
potential traffic impacts&#13;
* hydrogeological conditions are often a key siting factor to minimize potential for groundwater&#13;
contamination from leachate infiltration&#13;
* suitable land is often a limited resource, and facility location could require resettlement of both&#13;
titled landowners and squatters and/or the taking of agricultural land.&#13;
* potential effects on local property values.&#13;
* potential impacts of landfill traffic on local communities.&#13;
Socio-economic&#13;
* potential impacts on existing waste recycling/rag-picking community&#13;
Public Health&#13;
* uncontrolled mingling of clinical or hazardous waste with municipal waste stream&#13;
* worker risks of exposure to clinical or hazardous waste&#13;
107&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project TechnicalAnnex&#13;
* public risks of exposure to clinical or hazardous wastes&#13;
* local community health impacts from airborne pathogens or animal vectors&#13;
* potential explosion from unmanaged methane gas production.&#13;
Noise&#13;
* noise during construction and operation&#13;
* traffic noise&#13;
Water Resources&#13;
* potential for groundwater (aquifer) contamination from waste leachate&#13;
* potential for surface water contamination&#13;
Air Quality&#13;
*  dust during construction and operation from on-site vehicle movements and placement of waste&#13;
materials&#13;
*  vehicle exhaust emissions&#13;
*  smoke from fires&#13;
*  methane gas emission (methane is a major greenhouse gas); waste to energy options&#13;
Public Consultation&#13;
* public consultation has not traditionally been strong in the MNA region. It is important that EA for&#13;
all projects take the necessary measures to ensure adequate public consultation.&#13;
* gender and communication issues must be carefully considered and incorporated in the design of&#13;
public consultation exercises and in the dissemination of project information.&#13;
The EA Study and Report&#13;
1. Consultants are required to carry out an EA study and prepare an EA report according to the World&#13;
Bank standards. The report should include the following sections:&#13;
* Executive summary;&#13;
* Policy, Legal, and Administrative Framework;&#13;
* Project Objectives and Description;&#13;
* Baseline Data;&#13;
* Environmental Impacts (includes mitigation measures);&#13;
* Analysis of Alternatives;&#13;
* Environmental Management Plan; and&#13;
* Appendices.&#13;
2. The general requirements for the above are described in the introduction to this chapter (for&#13;
additional details see the World Bank's OP/BP/GP 4.01 - Environmental Assessment at the World&#13;
Bank). Specific aspects that should be addressed in an EA of a solid waste management project&#13;
are described below.+&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
Key Output for EA of Solid Waste Management Project (in addition to Box 1.2)&#13;
Policy, Legal, and Administrative  Tables should be used to list applicable standards and note which authorities are responsible for&#13;
Framework:                        their application. Where there are no relevant local standards, World Bank General&#13;
Environmental Guidelines may be used (see Annex III). Where relevant local legislation and&#13;
standards exist, these should be described. The section should include:&#13;
*  national laws and local ordinances which delineate the solid waste management&#13;

buildings, weighbridges, roads, ramps, drainage, gas and leachate control systems,&#13;
monitoring wells);&#13;
* construction schedule, operating plans, closure plans, long-term monitoring plans, and&#13;
responsible parties.&#13;
Baseline Data         The key categories of data needed for a waste collection and disposal systems include the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a) For project improvements to collection systems:&#13;
Physical Environment&#13;
* Neighborhood layout, showing locations for communal containers, stops for truck during&#13;
block collection, or streets served by curb-side collection&#13;
* Conditions of road or walkway access for collection equipment;&#13;
* Climate and meteorology, as it affects refuse containment and frequency of collection.&#13;
Socio-cultural Environment&#13;
*  Population density and demographic level by neighborhood&#13;
*  Community structure of local leader and traditional public involvement process&#13;
*  Employment and other activities indicating patterns of movement to and from neighborhood&#13;
*  Education level with regard to sanitation and public health&#13;

*  rare, endangered, or commercially important species&#13;
Socio-cultural Environment&#13;
* past uses of sites and consideration of historic significance&#13;
* land use and demographic character of surrounding neighborhoods&#13;
* planned development activities&#13;
* education, awareness, and sensitivity of public to propose siting of facilities; and public&#13;
concems over traffic insects, noise, dust, odor, smoke or aesthetic issues.&#13;
Baseline data is often only partially available, though many countries will have a large part of&#13;
these data and inexpensive field investigations can provide much of the remainder. Where more&#13;
detailed information is required (if significant effects on an important natural or cultural&#13;
resource are anticipated, for example) there may be studies on local areas done by intemational&#13;
agencies. There may also be unpublished information in govemment departments, universities,&#13;
PhD theses, or voluntary groups. These should be investigated and used where relevant,&#13;
provided that the sources, and any assumptions or uncertainties in the data are documented.&#13;
Environmental         A prediction of the changes in the environment resulting from project construction and operation&#13;
Impacts:              are to be considered, and an assessment of the effect on the surrounding physical, biological, and&#13;
human systems, should be presented.&#13;
For solid waste projects, there are numerous potential impacts to be reviewed as a part of design.&#13;
For the most part, well-conceived designs will minimize adverse impacts. Also, altering&#13;
operating practices can minimize many potential impacts.&#13;
There are some potential impacts whose consequences would be environmentally significant&#13;
over the long term. With regard to these impacts, special studies conducted as a part of&#13;
environmental impact assessment are recommended. Specifically, prior to design of a land&#13;
disposal site, groundwater monitoring wells should be installed both on-site and off-site to&#13;
assess the character of soils, geology and groundwater quality and flow dynamics. Data from&#13;
these borings coupled with precipitation and infiltration data should be used to develop a&#13;
conceptual model of the landfill and estimate the quantity of leachate which could be generated&#13;
and released from the land disposal site and its potential effect on the nearest receiving water.&#13;
Analysis of           This section should provide a brief description of possible altematives to the project/project&#13;
Alternatives          design (including the 'no action' altemative). For various aspects of a solid waste management&#13;
project, there are appropriate altemative technologies or operating methods, as listed below.&#13;
The reasons why the various altematives considered were rejected should be documented.&#13;
Disposal Systems&#13;
* source reduction of wastes&#13;
* managed landfill&#13;
* sanitary landfill (i.e., designed refuse cell construction)&#13;
* sanitary landfill with gas and leachate control&#13;
* separate disposal zone in sanitary landfill or separate disposal site for&#13;
construction/demolition debris, bulky wastes and tires&#13;
* composting&#13;
* incineration&#13;

*  modify procurement specifications to increase opportunities for products made from&#13;
recycled materials&#13;
Environ mental        The EMP should indude details of the management initiatives to be implemented&#13;
Management Plan:      during both the construction (for landfill sites) and operational phase of the project.&#13;
The EMP will need to account for monitoring of environmental parameters and the&#13;
influence of mitigation measures on environmental impacts. It should indude the&#13;
following basic components.&#13;
Institutional Component&#13;
* Institutional responsibilities for management of the solid waste sector&#13;
* Responsibilities for monitoring, reporting and enforcement&#13;
* Identification of any needs for capacity building, training or equipment&#13;
Environmental Mitigation Plan&#13;
Table 1.6.1 presents the key aspects of a mitigation plan for a new solid waste management&#13;
facility.&#13;
Environmental Monitoring Plan&#13;
Monitoring should address both emission and ambient levels of pollutants where these may be&#13;
detrimental to human health. Table 1. 6.2 below presents a typical monitoring program for a&#13;
solid waste management facility.&#13;
112&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project Technical Annex&#13;
For solid waste projects which include a land disposal facility, monitoring will include:&#13;
*  gas and ground water monitoring wells&#13;
*  regular schedule of monitoring for key indicators of contamination (for specific parameters&#13;
see the World Bank's General Environmental Guidelines, which would apply to projects of&#13;
this type, provided in Annex 111).&#13;
*  If the land disposal site has a gas collection and ventilation system, periodic monitoring will&#13;
need to address:&#13;
*   The composition of gas being discharged from the vents&#13;
*   Ambient oxygen and combustible gas levels on- and off-site (using a portable meter).&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Iraq Emergency Water Supply,
            Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project aims to restore
            some basic water supply, sanitation, and urban services for
            urban areas outside Baghdad City through a) reconstruction
            and rehabilitation of existing facilities, and b) providing
            capacity building support through training and technical
            assistance. The project will complement support by other
            donors. The project will also create vitally needed
            short-term employment and help Iraq's capacity to
            manage large-scale reconstruction. There are 13 components:
            Rehabilitation and upgrading of water systems in Karbala
            (and its sewerage system), Majar, Beji, Kena'an, Al
            Hussainia, Al-Samawa, Badawa, Dohuk (and its stormwater
            drainage system), and Dukan; finances urban rehabilitation
            in Karbala, Badawa, and Basra; and funds capacity building
            and technical assistance.
