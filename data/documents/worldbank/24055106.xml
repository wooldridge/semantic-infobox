World Bank and entities (collectively, the "Donors") that provide contributions (the aggregate of all&#13;
contributions from the Donors, the "Contributions") to be administered by the World Bank for the Trust&#13;
Fund.&#13;
2. Objective and Expected Outcome of the Trust Fund Program&#13;
(a)    The overall program development objective of the Trust Fund is to strengthen the performance,&#13;
transparency and accountability of public financial management (PFM) in Nepal.&#13;
(b)    The Trust Fund is designed to support the following activities and other activities which may be&#13;
identified and agreed between the World Bank and the Donors that meet the development objective of the&#13;
program:&#13;
(i)    Strengthening PFM Systems and Capacities: formulation and implementation of various&#13;
reform strategies and actions that will strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of PFM&#13;
systems in Nepal. Activities may address cross-cutting issues related to PFM&#13;
comprehensiveness and transparency (including policy-based budgeting, predictability and&#13;
control in budget execution, accounting, recording and reporting, external scrutiny and&#13;
audit). These activities are expected to be carried out by the Recipient, and some analytical&#13;
and advisory activities will be carried out by the World Bank.&#13;
(ii)   Enhancing Accountability in Public Financial Management: support for activities that seek&#13;
to increase executive branch accountability for public expenditure management by&#13;
strengthening demand-side engagement on the part of civil society actors and public&#13;
institutions of accountability. Activities may include: expansion of social accountability&#13;
interventions by Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to improve PFM; capacity development&#13;
of public accountability institutions; and related analytic tasks. These activities are expected&#13;
to be a combination of Recipient-executed activities and World Bank-executed activities.&#13;
(iii)  Deepening Knowledge related to Public Expenditures and Financial Accountability (PEFA):&#13;
support for policy and technical studies, assessments, independent evaluations and other&#13;
knowledge-management activities that aim to improve understanding of public financial&#13;
management performance and the environment within which such systems operate, to help&#13;
measure value for money of publicly funded programs, and to define and inform future&#13;
public financial management reforms. These activities are expected to be carried out by the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
(iv)   Trust Fund Program Administration and Management: administration and management of&#13;
the Trust Fund, including mid-term and end-program evaluation of the Trust Fund. These&#13;
activities will be carried out by the World Bank.&#13;
3. Key expected results of the Trust Fund&#13;

constituencies; and&#13;
(c)    Better knowledge of value for money challenges and public financial management governance gaps,&#13;
contributing to improved design of public financial management interventions at the country and sector level.&#13;
4. Categories of Expenditure&#13;
(a)    For Recipient-Executed activities, the Contributions may be used to finance goods, consultants'&#13;
services, sub-grants, operating costs, media and workshops/training, study tours, travel expenses and&#13;
