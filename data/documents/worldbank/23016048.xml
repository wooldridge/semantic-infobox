&#13;
BECKER: Good morning. Today is Thursday, April 27, 2006. I'm with the World&#13;
Bank in Washington, D.C. My name is William Becker. I'm with the George&#13;
Washington University and the Bank's Oral History Program. I'm here today to&#13;
interview Robert Calderisi, who retired from the Bank in 2002?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Yes. In July of 2002.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So, it's very nice to see you, and if you wouldn't mind spelling your name&#13;
for the transcribers.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Thanks so much. It's C-A-L-D-E-R-I-S-I.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. I'm going to start with some fairly obvious questions. And the first&#13;
is, when and where were you born?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: I was born in Montreal, on November 29, 1948.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And you received your education in Canada, in Montreal?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: At the University of Montreal, but also at Oxford and the University of&#13;
Sussex, also in the UK, and the London School of Economics [and Political Science].&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Were there anyone in your family who were economists, or academics, or&#13;
were interested in Africa?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: No, none at all. No, my father was a factory worker, and my mother was&#13;
a housewife. And I was the first person in my family, with my twin brother, to receive a&#13;
university education. And we were the last of seven children.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What careers have your siblings followed?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: My twin brother became a surgeon in Vancouver. My oldest sister&#13;
headed the Music Library Division at the National Archives of Canada. And I had a&#13;
brother who was a vice president of one of the largest jewelry chains in Canada. I have&#13;
another brother who is a well-known actor in Toronto. My brother was a carpenter. So&#13;
it's quite a diverse group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: It is in your school years though, then, that your interest in Africa developed.&#13;
How did that come about?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, I did my first degree in history at Loyola College, which was part&#13;
of the University of Montreal at the time. Now it's part of Concordia University. And&#13;
there was a professor there who was starting a program in African studies named Donald&#13;
Savage, and he first piqued my interest in Africa. But I actually didn't do any courses&#13;
with him on Africa; I just learned, and became interested in the place through contacts&#13;
with him that year and the next. And when I won a Rhodes Scholarship in 1968 to go to&#13;
Oxford, and I had a third year to use on that scholarship, and I thought, "Oh well, why&#13;
not also do an MA in African Studies?" which I did at the University of Sussex. So that's&#13;
when I became immersed in African issues.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What did you study at Oxford?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: I did economics.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Economics. Okay, because I wanted to ask about ...&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Yes, because I switched from history to economics. I'd always been&#13;
interested in economics, and Oxford gave me a chance study it. Even at Sussex, where I&#13;
was doing African studies, it was the economic history of Africa that I was studying, a&#13;
combination of the two disciplines.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And I gather from your book, The Trouble with Africa [New York: Palgrave&#13;
Macmillan, 2006], your recently published book, that you were a Rhodes Scholar at the&#13;
same time as Bill [William J.] Clinton.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Did you get to know him?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, we saw each other a few times in-in large groups over dinner&#13;
with ten or eleven people at a time. And then I followed his career with great interest, but&#13;
I never really knew him.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You also mentioned the London School of Economics, which, frankly, I&#13;
hadn't picked up in my research about you. So, when were you there?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: I was there in 1973-74, on educational leave from the Department of&#13;
Finance in Ottawa. And I was beginning a doctorate in the history of economic theory.&#13;
Again, this twin interest in history and economics, but I decided to drop it after a year. I&#13;
realized that I didn't want to teach economics, and that would be the only real reason to&#13;
complete a doctorate in something as specialized as the history of economic theory. But&#13;
it was a good opportunity to learn some more about economic theory, and also meet some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                             3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
good people. Then I went back to the Department of Finance, after that year, to resume&#13;
my work in the federal government.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Was there anyone particular whom you worked with at the London School&#13;
who had any influence on your thinking?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: No. But there were people at Sussex who impressed me a great deal,&#13;
including Hans [Walter] Singer, the great development economist, who died just three&#13;
weeks ago. I remember walking across the Sussex Downs with him one afternoon and&#13;
having a long conversation,just the two of us, about poverty in the world and whether it&#13;
could be fought successfully or not.&#13;
&#13;
And my supervisor at Sussex, Christopher Wrigley, who was a wonderful economist and&#13;
historian. He'd done a short agrarian history of Uganda, which was a tremendous little&#13;
book [Crops and Wealth in Uganda. Kampala: East African Institute of Social Research,&#13;
1959]. And he was full of ideas and challenges. They were two people who-who I&#13;
remember very fondly from those days.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, when you finished at Sussex, you had a master's degree in African&#13;
studies. Armed with this degree, what were your job prospects?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, I was actually hoping to teach, but I didn't have enough graduate&#13;
work to teach at university, and I had too much post-secondary education to really be&#13;
hired by a private college, or high school, in England, as I would have been too expensive&#13;
under the pay scales at the time. So I was out of contention on both fronts. And, of&#13;
course, African studies was the only subject in which I'd done post-graduate work, and&#13;
that was not something that was on the curriculum at that point of community colleges in&#13;
Canada, which was the other possibility. So, I actually accepted ajob as a volunteer&#13;
teacher on Mount Kilimanjaro which a friend offered.&#13;
&#13;
And so I went home to Canada in October in 1971, expecting to leave for Tanzania in&#13;
January of '72 to teach African history to African school girls at the 5,000-foot level of&#13;
Mount Kilimanjaro. But when I got home, I found a letter from the Public Service&#13;
Commission of Canada inviting me for an interview for a job at the Department of&#13;
Finance in Ottawa, which I got. And I decided then I'd prefer to go back to Africa as an&#13;
economist rather than as a volunteer teacher.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. How did that-had you applied to the Canadian ...?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Yes, I sent a letter to the Public Service Commission saying that, you&#13;
know, I was coming home, and expressing an interest in jobs as an economist.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What were your responsibilities at the finance ministry?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: First, I started working on mineral and natural resource policy generally,&#13;
but particularly minerals, and oil and gas. That was 1971-75, before and during the oil&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Robert Calderisi

&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
cnsls. And so Canada was trying to develop polices to promote the further processing of&#13;
its mineral exports in Canada rather than shipping just the ore or the concentrate&#13;
overseas. And then, when oil prices went up, we had to decide whether to protect&#13;
Canadian industries and consumers from that oil price rise. So it was a very good,&#13;
intensive introduction into applying economic theory to practical problems.&#13;
&#13;
When I came back from the London School of Economics-still at the Department of&#13;
Finance-I worked on agriculture policy, and there the issues were, you know, whether&#13;
to continue to protect Canada's farmers and the dairy industry, for example. And-and&#13;
also, when sugar prices went up radically in 1974-75, whether to also subsidize sugar,&#13;
things like that, which were a real application of economics to down-to-earth human&#13;
problems. It was a tremendous introduction to economic policy, to short, incisive&#13;
writing, because the product we had to create was a two-and-a-half page briefing note on&#13;
some of these complex issues for the minister, for his cabinet committee meetings.&#13;
&#13;
And also it was a good introduction to democracy and political accountability. I can&#13;
remember as a young civil servant being frightened that the phone would ring, and it&#13;
would be somebody in a member of parliament's office wanting some information, and if&#13;
I didn't answer it properly, I could be named in the House of Commons as not being&#13;
helpful. That was the kind ofthing that made a big difference, but I always remembered&#13;
it as a sign of checks and balances in an open political system.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Like hanging, it tends to focus one's attention.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That was ajoke. Well, in fact it's good because that was one of my&#13;
questions. What ideas did you develop about development in your years at the finance&#13;
ministry?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, obviously Canada and Africa had very little in common when it&#13;
came to economic development. But it's true that the federal government in Ottawa had&#13;
to develop policies of regional development, to help the more backward regions of the&#13;
country catch up with the growth and prosperity of the rest of Canada. So there were tax&#13;
policies and other incentive polices used to attract industries to particular parts ofthe&#13;
country. And I also served on the Advisory Committee on Northern Development, which&#13;
sought solutions for communities which were at a tremendous disadvantage because of&#13;
geography and the lack of economic opportunity. And there, I suppose, apart from the&#13;
climate, there was a parallel with Africa.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: And so I learned how creative a government could be in tweaking market&#13;
forces but also how helpless it could be in really determining an outcome, and that,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Robert Calderisi

&amp;#12;                                                                                             5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ultimately, all you could hope for was for government promotion to make a net&#13;
contribution to the outcome. So I guess it made me a little-a little skeptical later in my&#13;
career about persisting in solving problems which weren't solving themselves just&#13;
through the expenditure of public money.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I would imagine also that you got calls from members of parliament, and that&#13;
you understood-you got some sense of what politics was about&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Right Very much. Fortunately, I never got one of those calls. But we&#13;
were very much on our toes. We had to be. I think now, of course, of how few Africans&#13;
have had that kind of discipline, and how it's probably one of the reasons Africa is still&#13;
failing.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. Okay. Now, following your work at the Ministry of Finance, you&#13;
joined the Canadian International Development Agency [CIDA], which, obviously, was&#13;
responsible for Canadian foreign aid. One, why did you make this change, or how did&#13;
that come about?&#13;
&#13;
CALD ERISI: Well, I was still interested in going to Africa, eventually, as an&#13;
economist Having about four years of experience as an economist on general resource&#13;
policy issues, I thought it was a good time to move to the agency that was managing&#13;
Canada's foreign aid. And I hoped for-and in fact achieved-an overseas assignment&#13;
with the CIDA in Tanzania. So it brought me back to the country where I expected to&#13;
serve as a volunteer teacher, but now I was first secretary for development of the&#13;
Canadian Embassy in Tanzania, and on the front row, watching one of the most important&#13;
experiments in economic development in Africa under Tanzanian President Julius&#13;
Nyerere, who was the father of African Socialism. Actually, I devoted a chapter of my&#13;
book to him, and I defend his record, which is now quite fashionable to attack.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, right. Is this a normal or logical career path for someone at CIDA; I&#13;
mean, to join and immediately be assigned overseas?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: At the time it was.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: It waS?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: At the time it was, although partly because at the time there weren't very&#13;
many economists joining CIDA. I suppose I was one ofthe few who came to CIDA from&#13;
what was considered one of the most important ministries in Ottawa. Very few people&#13;
left Finance or the Treasury Board. They were the most powerful agencies in Ottawa. In&#13;
fact, my roommate at the time never left Finance. He's now the deputy minister of&#13;
finance. That was a more typical career for a young economist at the time.&#13;
&#13;
But I grew tired of being a young man in an old man's department because one would sit&#13;
around a table with people from other ministries, and they'd be submitting their&#13;
proposals, and it was the bad fellows from Finance and Treasury Board who were&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                             6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
pointing out how difficult it would be to fund all these dreams. And working in&#13;
development seemed to be a much better way of applying that knowledge of human&#13;
welfare than arguing around tables about whether maple syrup should be subsidized or&#13;
not.&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, what were your responsibilities in Dar-es-Salaam?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: I was responsible for planning and overseeing all of Canada's aid to&#13;
Tanzania, and Tanzania is one of the largest recipients for Canadian aid at the time; it's&#13;
always been. But in particular, I planned a railway improvement program for the&#13;
country, which was one of the largest projects that Canada had financed anywhere in the&#13;
world, including Asia, where Canada had very large projects. So I was deeply involved&#13;
in transport issues in Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How is it that Canada selected this country as a place to focus its attention?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, you know, as a member of the Commonwealth, Canada had a&#13;
particular interest in Africa, which was a third of the membership. And in fact the&#13;
division I worked in was called Commonwealth Africa, to distinguish it from the FrenchÂ­&#13;
speaking countries. There was also a division for Francophone Africa. And Canada tried&#13;
to give roughly as much aid to the English-speaking countries as the French-speaking&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
I started working on Southern Africa, the little countries in and around South Africa, and&#13;
moving to Tanzania was logical because we only had a few posts overseas for CIDA, and&#13;
they were in the larger high commissions or embassies, and Tanzania was one of them. I&#13;
had done my MA thesis on the history ofthe East African Community, and Tanzania was&#13;
one of the members of that community. And, of course, Nyerere was fascinating&#13;
everybody at the time. Everybody in the world who had an interest in development and&#13;
Africa was hoping that Julius Nyerere would succeed. So I went after that job with some&#13;
purpose.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How did this initial experience in Africa influence your views of the&#13;
continent?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, actually-perhaps the most important thing it did for me was to&#13;
interest me in the World Bank because before being in Tanzania I had some other&#13;
negative views about the institution, given the fact that I was, like many people at the&#13;
time, at least a social democrat, if not a socialist. And all I associated with the World&#13;
Bank was its role in helping the U.S. overthrow Salvador Allende in Chile. And so I&#13;
associated the World Bank with other U.S. government efforts to oppress Latin American&#13;
societies, and particularly regimes which they disagreed with. So, like many people of&#13;
my generation, I didn't have a high opinion ofthe World Bank. It's remarkable how 30&#13;
years later those perceptions persist.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                            7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
In Tanzania, almost from the first day, I crossed paths with some energetic, committed&#13;
young people like myself, who just so happened to be working with the World Bank;&#13;
people like Jim [James W.] Adams, who is now the Vice President for Operations Policy&#13;
[and Country Services] here at the Bank. Ping-Cheung Loh, who was a-a tremendous&#13;
person. Richard [D.] Stem, wh0-2-who was Director of Industry [Director, Energy and&#13;
Industry Department] at the World Bank later, and then he finished as the Vice President&#13;
of Human Resources.&#13;
&#13;
And the Bank's resident representative in Tanzania, Lyle [M.] Hansen, who was a lay&#13;
saint. He'd worked in Pakistan and other places, and he involved me in all his work,&#13;
even though I was at the Canadian Embassy, as he saw a kindred soul. And he was very&#13;
much the man who mentored me, and encouraged me to come to the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
So, apart from enjoying my time in Africa and beginning to see at firsthand what these&#13;
problems really looked like, what I associate with Tanzania is my keen desire to join the&#13;
Bank, because the Bank at that time was helping Nyerere build socialism in Tanzania,&#13;
nothing less than that.&#13;
&#13;
Some people cynically have said since then that Robert [S.] McNamara needed a good&#13;
left-wing example of success to counterbalance all his support of other experiments in the&#13;
world which were less than left wing. But I think there was a genuine interest in trying to&#13;
have the socialist experiment in Tanzania work, and if it worked, to spread. Because this&#13;
wasn't a very dangerous socialism. Tanzania had no interest in becoming a part of the&#13;
Communist bloc. It wasn't like Benin or Guinea in the west, who actually slavishly&#13;
imitated the Soviet Union. Nyerere's socialism was founded on Christianity and&#13;
traditional values of African sharing. And when things got rough, you know, when the&#13;
ruling party tried to impose communal agriculture and it didn't work, Nyerere said,&#13;
"Let's drop it." What distinguished Nyerere's experiment was a focus on smallholder&#13;
agriculture and a determination not to depend on foreign aid, to be self-reliant. And he&#13;
tried to keep things simple, saying that the two most important things about development&#13;
were getting children to the school and clean water to people.&#13;
&#13;
I think that was why McNamara and others around the world, including Canada, wanted&#13;
to do all they could to help Tanzania. Paradoxically, Tanzania then became one ofthe&#13;
countries most dependent on foreign aid and least self-reliant. But I think that they&#13;
remain one of the few countries in Africa that uses aid intelligently and deserves to&#13;
continue to be helped.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I guess this was a period of time also that McNamara became intensely&#13;
interested in agriculture, so that might have something to do with it.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Yes, I think it was the 1973 Annual Meetings speech in Nairobi which he&#13;
devoted to the importance of agriculture. And of course, Nyerere, in his 1967 Arusha&#13;
&#13;

Declaration, put agriculture and rural development right at the heart of his strategy for&#13;
Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Nevertheless, you went to work for the OECD [Organization for Economic&#13;
Co-operation and Development] right after, so ...&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, there's a story behind that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I would like to get that story for the record here.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: I actually applied for the Young Professionals [YP] Program from&#13;
Tanzania, and I was interviewed in Nairobi in August of 1978. In fact, it was a rather&#13;
scary time in Nairobi because their first president, [lomo] Kenyatta, had died, and they'd&#13;
never had a change of government. And that was the week that Daniel arap Moi became&#13;
president of Kenya, but no one really knew whether he'd be accepted because he wasn't&#13;
from the Kikuyu tribe.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, I had a very pleasant set of interviews, and then I didn't hear anything for three&#13;
months. And in the meantime, I was leaving Tanzania in October, and I decided I didn't&#13;
want to work with the Canadian CIDA any longer. I started looking around for jobs, and&#13;
the OECD offered me a position at their Development Assistance Committee. And&#13;
without news from the Bank, I just accepted the job. And then the day I was leaving&#13;
Tanzania, in October, I got a letter of acceptance for the Young Professionals Program&#13;
from the World Bank. "Well," I said, "can I try next year?" So they said okay. And then&#13;
I went to Paris. It was very pleasant, of course, but I hated my job.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I was going to ask about-the administrator for development assistance.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Yeah. It was very tedious. I was involved in trying to develop ways of&#13;
simplifying and harmonizing aid procedures among donor countries, to reduce the burden&#13;
on recipient governments. The idea was fine, but it wasn't very successful. We did&#13;
analyses of individual countries, the U.S., the European Communities, as it was called at&#13;
the time, Germany, Japan. And we came to conclusion that the largest donors preferred&#13;
to keep their procedures complicated because this way they wouldn't spend much money.&#13;
And on top of that it gave them the excuse to be able to tell their parliaments and their&#13;
auditors-general that they were spending their money very carefully. So, I thought, well,&#13;
this was spinning wheels for nothing. By the way, the OECD is still, almost 30 years&#13;
later, trying to harmonize donor procedures, so I think I was right to give up after six&#13;
months.&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
And so, then I got a phone call from Washington, and it was Jim Adams, the fellow I&#13;
mentioned already, and he said, "How would you like to succeed me as loan officer for&#13;
Tanzania?"&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He said, "I'm moving off to work on Indonesia."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, you're not in a position to offer me ajob."&#13;
&#13;
But he said, "No, but my director can interview you on the way to Tanzania for his first&#13;
mission." This was 10chen Kraske.&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Okay." So 10chen interviewed me in Paris.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, I also went through Young Professionals interviews again. And this&#13;
time, a little more promptly than the first time, the Bank got back to me and said they&#13;
would like me in the Young Professionals Program, and-but 10chen Kraske also offered&#13;
me a job through direct hire rather than through the YP Program, and I chose to do that.&#13;
I'd already had eight years of professional experience. Even though I was only 30, I&#13;
didn't feel like much of a young professional. I'd started university when I was 15, so I&#13;
had a sort of a time advantage over other people my age. There was a little bit of a tug-ofÂ­&#13;
war between the [Eastern] Africa Region of the Bank and the YP Program about whether&#13;
I could come in directly, but in the end, the [Eastern] Africa Region won, and that's how&#13;
I came to Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
What about the Bank's procedures at the time, like international competitive bidding?&#13;
How did they strike you?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, one ofthe things that distinguished the World Bank at the time was&#13;
when it promised the country something-and I saw that in Tanzania-they delivered,&#13;
more or less on time. And that impressed me, whereas my own government-the&#13;
Canadian government-kept promising things and either not doing them or doing them&#13;
two or three years late.&#13;
&#13;
So I rather liked the prospect of working with an organization that was prepared to set&#13;
fairly strict timetables for projects and delivered rather like, you know, a commercial&#13;
organization. And that part of the Bank's service attracted me tremendously. So that was&#13;
one of the reasons, too, I wanted to come to the Bank. I no longer saw it as an enemy of&#13;
progressive values and, secondly, it was an organization which seemed to mean business.&#13;
And thirdly, it wasn't representing anybody's foreign policy. It was attacking problems&#13;
for their own sake rather than, you know, trying to win points with governments. That&#13;
was another attraction to working at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So where were you stationed? Your-your responsibility was, I guess, for&#13;
Kenya and ...&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: And Tanzania, but out of Washington.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                          10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, what were your responsibilities as the senior loan officer?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: I spent my time--like any young loan officer at the time--chairing project&#13;
preparation team meetings, making certain the projects were meeting Bank policy and&#13;
standards, and responding to information that the government themselves had given us,&#13;
negotiating these, and arguing for larger or more diverse programs and assistance for&#13;
Tanzania. Also, just defending the Bank's work there with journalists and other people.&#13;
So it was kind of a broad generalist work that loan officers had at the time.&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, the loan officers were the envy of the Bank at the time because they did&#13;
see the big picture, and they also got down to the nitty-gritty and sometimes satisfying&#13;
detail of individual operations, and it was they who engaged in the dialogue on economic&#13;
policy and public investment in government. So it was a tremendous job, and Tanzania&#13;
was one ofthe most visible programs at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: That was the time the Bank was already large, but still small enough in its&#13;
operating style that loan officers would get a phone call from the number two person at&#13;
the Bank, Ernie [Ernest] Stem, to question the case that had been made to the Loan&#13;
Committee for a project. The Loan Committee rarely met back then, but they got papers&#13;
on these projects, and it would be Ernie Stem who would call the loan officer and put him&#13;
or her on the spot about, you know, how valid the assumptions were, how reasonable the&#13;
targets, how heroic or un-heroic the assumptions were. And it was very useful and also&#13;
quite rewarding to have that contact with a senior manager without going through any of&#13;
the layers. And then, within minutes, a good loan officer would record the conversation&#13;
for everybody concerned in between. And that was a tremendous opportunity for growth&#13;
and learning in the institution; it was lost later.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. Well, it happens in large organizations as they get more cumbersome.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Processes become too heavy.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Were Stem's calls on the order of calls from the members of parliament?&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Yes. In fact, yes, an excellent parallel. It wasn't always he who called.&#13;
Sometimes it would be his adviser, who--AI [Abraham A.] Raizen, who was, again, a&#13;
wonderfully avuncular, wise man who, after he'd gone through the questions that he and&#13;
Ernie Stem felt had to be answered, would then give some fatherly advice on how to&#13;
improve the presentation and the argument or suggest a project where a similar approach&#13;
had been tried and to see what they'd learned. Again, wonderful coaching.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: But Stem has, obviously, a reputation for being stem.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           II&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CALDERlSI: Yes. Exactly. But he was also lucid and usually right, which is what we&#13;
respected most about him.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, you traveled-as part of your responsibilities, you traveled ...&#13;
&#13;
CALDERlSI: Well, probably three, four times a year for at least two or three weeks.&#13;
And, of course, in Tanzania I was at an advantage because, having lived there for two&#13;
years, I already knew the country quite well, and I knew many people in positions of&#13;
authority or influence, and I was picking up where I left off. That was tremendous. So in&#13;
the end I spent, combined with the Canadian CIDA work, six years working on Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Again-the question I've asked you before-but one of the things I'm trying&#13;
to get at is how you have come to the views that you've come to about Africa, and what&#13;
did this experience have on your developing views of Africa and development in Africa?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERlSI: Let me say a word about mentoring, though, because that's important,&#13;
too. To me a great revelation in that first job was Jochen Kraske. He was not a man&#13;
whom everyone appreciated. And in fact, he didn't have a good relationship with the&#13;
Vice President for Eastern Africa at the time, Willi [W.A.] Wapenhans, to whom-with&#13;
whom I got rather close at a later date. He was gruff and skeptical about Africa. His&#13;
entire development career had been in Asia, and he thought we were pandering and&#13;
beating around the bush with the Africans, and all he saw in Tanzania on his first visit&#13;
was a lot of nonsense. And instead of being disappointed, I rather liked that contrarian&#13;
approach. He was swimming against the tide, but it was clear that his values were the&#13;
same as mine or anybody else's, which were that there are poor people in Tanzania, and&#13;
is this government really going to help those poor people rather than experiment&#13;
endlessly with institutions and the like? And that impressed me.&#13;
&#13;
And the second thing was that, although he was a gruff man and almost sometimes&#13;
socially awkward, he had the most wonderful instincts about reasoning and argument.&#13;
And some of the best advice I got on writing an argument would come from him. I mean,&#13;
many people would resent having their director, two levels above you, actually mark up&#13;
the draft. It was vaguely insulting. Every time he marked up one of my drafts, never&#13;
heavily, they were just spot on, and that was to me a good sign. So, arriving at the Bank I&#13;
was thoroughly vindicated in my view that this was an institution that mixed a&#13;
businesslike approach with very strong intellectual input to the work. And Jochen was a&#13;
wonderful man. I've admired him ever since.&#13;
&#13;
His contrarian approach, and the fact that I, too, had some doubts about the Tanzania&#13;
experiment while I was still living there, added to my sense of perhaps, yes, one should&#13;
be more critical and doubting, rather than all-accepting. And I certainly approached&#13;
subjects with intellectual independence, but during those years, I was torn between two&#13;
horses. One was a sense of admiration for Tanzania and loyalty to the country, and the&#13;
pressures which were building all around, within the Bank to say, "Look, let's admit the&#13;
emperor had no clothes, and small fanners in Tanzania are worse off now than before the&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Arusha Declaration. And it's time to stop pretending that the government is being proÂ­&#13;
 agriculture. "&#13;
&#13;
  And I was defending the Tanzanian program against some very vocal critics, like Uma&#13;
  [J.] Lele, who'd written a book about failed experiments in rural development in Africa 
&#13;
  and seemed to me to be wanting to bait Tanzania and put it in the same class of countries 
&#13;
. as Zambia and Malawi that she'd studied in her book. And I felt that an institution of the 
&#13;
  Bank's size, which had invested so much in the country and had also raised the country's&#13;
  hopes, should not veer wildly from one point of view to another. I kept pointing out,&#13;
  loyally, as a loan officer for Tanzania, that not very much had changed in Tanzania. It&#13;
  was still a poor country with limited resources and a long way to go. All that had really&#13;
  changed was attitudes in Washington.&#13;
                                                                                                       I&#13;
                                                                                                       I&#13;
 Of course, Reaganism [Ronald Reagan] and Thatcherism [Margaret Thatcher] were&#13;
 beginning to creep through the corridors of these agencies. So I was, by the end, almost&#13;
 one ofthe sole defenders of Tanzania in the institution. It seemed inappropriate for a&#13;
 loan officer to say, "Look, if we're to slow down the program, or change gears, let's do it&#13;
                                                                                                       I&#13;
                                                                                                       ~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 at a graceful pace rather than a violent one."&#13;
                                                                                                       ~&#13;
 So that was an interesting time, but I didn't see it at the time. But now I think it was part         [&#13;
 of a general adjustment of attitudes and viewpoints that the World Bank generally on&#13;
 Africa, perhaps even more widely in the world, about the role of the state as a motor of&#13;
                                                                                                       I&#13;
 economic growth and development.                                                                      t&#13;
 BECKER: This was the end of the McNamara era, and you've alluded to Reaganism&#13;
 and Thatcherism. Did that have any effect on your career, on your thinking about the&#13;
 Bank?&#13;
&#13;
 CALDERISI: No, I was a stubborn social democrat still. And I didn't-I still don't&#13;
                                                                                                       I&#13;
                                                                                                       [&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 think, 30 years later, that the market by itself can help Africa. I think a free market will&#13;
 help create wealth and a free press will help keep business and government honest, but I&#13;
 think it's public policy that will put girls and keep girls in school and fight HIV and&#13;
 AIDS ruthlessly and improve water systems.&#13;
&#13;
 What I did agree with and argue is still the case in Africa in my book is that there was an&#13;
 in-built bias against business generally and against agriculture and small-scale&#13;
 agriculture, which lost Africa a lot of its markets and a lot of its-Â·a lot of time, because&#13;
 the single--the single most important event or development in modem African history&#13;
 has been the loss of half of its markets between 1970 and 1990. Africa's still paying the&#13;
 price for negligence and inertia and the persecution which caused agriCUlture to decline.&#13;
&#13;
 [Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
 So Africa lost half its market, which was equivalent to $70 billion a year in-in 1990&#13;
 dollars. Think of that. That's almost three times the foreign aid that Africa gets. So the&#13;
 whole structural adjustment controversy in Africa was a big misunderstanding. We may&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
talk about that a little later, but that's the central development in Africa and, obviously,&#13;
Africans have to put first things first, and the first thing they need to protect and promote&#13;
is the ability of people to grow food for themselves and for others and produce things&#13;
which other people in the world will be prepared to buy.&#13;
&#13;
And so in that sense, of course, Reagan and Thatcher were right. The basic economic&#13;
policy had to be fixed before you could move to issues of distribution and improving the&#13;
quality ofthat growth. Africa's certainly is shrinking, not growing, so I suppose it was a&#13;
blast of cold air which was quite necessary at the time. But I still feel the government is&#13;
important and-and there's only so much that private investment and the market can do&#13;
in-in poor countries. But without business confidence, without a sense that we're&#13;
operating from the same system of values, governments and donors, we're not going to&#13;
get very far in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. And then you left Africa, or you left the work on Africa to become&#13;
the senior loan officer for Indonesia. How did that come about?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: I succeeded Jim Adams again. And it was a tremendous education&#13;
because, of course, like many people I'd kept making excuses for Africa, you know:&#13;
disease and climate and young institutions and the like. But I found all of these things in&#13;
Indonesia, too. Among the East Asian countries, Indonesia was quite African in its stage&#13;
of development, but it was changing fast.&#13;
&#13;
You know, you could see development from one trip to the next in Indonesia. And they&#13;
were doing all the right things, and it's not a much-told story any longer because since&#13;
1997, when they had their financial crisis and, you know, corruption and cronyism behind&#13;
Indonesian growth also became apparent. It's-it's gone out of fashion.&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia remains one of the few countries in world history, not just modem history,&#13;
that's managed its resource boom successfully. It's invested its oil revenues into things&#13;
which made a difference for poor people--you know, improved varieties of rice, rural&#13;
irrigation, non-formal learning for adults, and family planning--all of which meant that&#13;
the rural sector also prospered, not just the resource industries, and that people obtained&#13;
the skills and improved their health in a way that they could actually contribute more to&#13;
their own well-being and the well-being of their communities.&#13;
&#13;
And between 1970 and 1990, Indonesia reduced the number of poor people in the country&#13;
from 60 percent to 20 percent of the population. That's a fantastic achievement, and I&#13;
think one of the best examples of successful foreign aid. So I learned a lot in the course&#13;
of those years as a loan officer, and I tried to apply what I learned later when I went back&#13;
to Africa.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Were there people there with whom you worked who later influenced your&#13;
career or your outlook?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: I had the good fortune of working with Ann [0.] Hamilton, a colorful,&#13;
brilliant, plain-spoken Texan woman. '&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You mentioned her, I think, in the book.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: She was a division chief for India for 15 years, at a time when the Bank&#13;
was a very important actor there.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Is she still with the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: No, she retired in-in 1997, I think. She had a falling out with [World&#13;
Bank President James D.] Wolfensohn. Wolfensohn blamed her for getting the Bank&#13;
involved in the Arun project in Nepal, I think. It was attracting criticism from&#13;
environmental groups, and she'd become-I guess she was a country director in that&#13;
Region [Country Department I, South Asia Region]. Essentially, Wolfensohn eased her&#13;
out, but she's still living in Washington, and she's one of the most impressive people in&#13;
the Bank. When I got to work with her, she was a legend already.&#13;
&#13;
I also worked with Mark Baird of New Zealand. He was the lead economist for&#13;
Indonesia. We worked closely together. We'd also worked in the East African division&#13;
[Eastern Africa Country Programs Department I] in the early '80s together. So--and so&#13;
we moved over to Indonesia together, and he was a tremendous colleague.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, there were lots of project staff. East Asia had some of the best people in the&#13;
Bank, and they didn't leave. It was so exciting to work on countries that were actually&#13;
developing that it attracted the best people, and people tend to serve a long time in East&#13;
Asia. There was a wealth of people I worked with who were an inspiration day in, day&#13;
out.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Were there Indonesians with whom you worked and got to know?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: No, unfortunately not, apart from Jannes Hutagalung, who was at the&#13;
finance ministry and later became Indonesia's Executive Director at the Bank. There was&#13;
no one I can remember that I was particularly close to, but that was typical because the&#13;
Indonesians were quite careful about personal relationships, and they were very intent on&#13;
not to be seen to be dictated to by the World Bank or the IMF [International Monetary&#13;
Fund].&#13;
&#13;
In fact, Indonesia was one of the few countries at the time that did not have an IMF&#13;
program, even though, you know, they ran into problems in the late '70s and then the mid&#13;
'80s, when the real price of oil dropped. And debt was becoming burdensome, but they&#13;
preferred to discuss a program with the IMF and agree on what they should do but not&#13;
take their money. They preferred to have recourse to international capital markets. They&#13;
felt having an IMF program would send the wrong signals to the outside world. And&#13;
also, again, they didn't want the public to think that their government was taking&#13;
marching orders, even from the Bank.&#13;

The conditionality on loans to Indonesia were light, in the sense that the conditions all&#13;
were met before the project started. This was made possible by a so-called parallel&#13;
approach, where, on the economic and sector work side we agreed ahead of time what&#13;
kind ofthings should be in place before a certain investment was completed, or a certain&#13;
budget support provided. And it was the only country where the Bank could announce at&#13;
the Board discussion of the new operation that all the conditions of the project had been&#13;
met ahead of time.&#13;
&#13;
So that's why the-the project went ahead without the government having to meet any&#13;
particular targets or policy measures in the course of it. There was a very elegant way of&#13;
staging the assistance so that the government-with the help and the advice-without              I&#13;
                                                                                                I&#13;
seeming to be taking orders.                                                                    ~&#13;
                                                                                                I'&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Living in Singapore, I learned a lot about Indonesia and Malaysia just&#13;
reading local the newspapers. The way the IMF dealt with the government and the crisis&#13;
stirred a bit of controversy. What the Singaporeans picked up on--and of course the&#13;
                                                                                                I&#13;
Indonesians felt very deeply about--was the way the IMF had dealt with their leadership.&#13;
The Indonesians did not confront this head on but dealt with it indirectly. It was&#13;
described to me as a matter of using the techniques of shadow puppets; I think the term is&#13;
wayang. .&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Yes, I was also thinking about the wayang show.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I was told that to understand Indonesia you had to understand the puppets.&#13;
&#13;
One other question I wanted to ask you about the Indonesian experience. You discuss&#13;
good policies of promoting savings, keeping inflation down, using resources for rural&#13;
development, schools, hospitals, and all these other things. Where does that come from?&#13;
As you say in your book, and as you say here, there's a similarity in experience in these&#13;
two places, with countries in Africa and a colonial past. What do you attribute the good&#13;
policies to in Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, I was going to say I don't have the answer to that, but I know the&#13;
answer to this: good policies on the macroeconomic side, and that the Indonesians, the&#13;
key policy makers, had all been trained in the United States. They were called the&#13;
Berkeley Mafia.&#13;
&#13;
What I don't have an answer for is why they added to the standard macroeconomic stance&#13;
the pro-poor public investment policy. I don't know what their inspiration was. At the&#13;
time I didn't worry about it because we were just keen on helping them do it. I doubt&#13;
they learned that at Berkeley; it may have been by watching Malaysia and Korea and&#13;
Taiwan, who were also funding basic health and education as an integral part of a general&#13;
development strategy. Also, they needed to find a way of using or (to use the jargon)&#13;
"sterilizing" the windfall earnings from oil and gas after the first oil crisis. The most&#13;
obvious and least damaging way to do that macro economically was to invest it in the&#13;

&#13;
rural areas rather than in the modem sector. But that's speculation, rather than fully&#13;
informed answer.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
Now from '85 to '87 you take the position as chief administrative officer for East Asia&#13;
and the Pacific.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Yeah, it was my first management job.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. Again, my standard question: how did that come about and ...&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, I succeeded Jim Adams again.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Again.&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Yeah, Jim Adams was leaving that job, and I was one of the candidates,&#13;
and I managed to hit it off with the Vice President for East Asia at the time, Attila&#13;
Karaosmanoglu, a former deputy prime minister of Turkey. And, yes, it was a&#13;
competitive process, but I won it. I think most people expected it to be given to a woman&#13;
who had seniority and experience similar to mine, and for some reason he chose me. He&#13;
was criticized for choosing a man rather than a qualified, talented woman at the time&#13;
when the institution was trying to promote women, but I liked his decision.&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now again, what does one do as a chief administrative officer in this&#13;
position?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: I was his chief of staff, looking after the budget, improvements to our&#13;
general processes and operations, and the staff development programs, making certain he&#13;
was getting his briefings for important events, like the annual meetings and the spring&#13;
meetings, on time. And I was responsible for overseeing the development of information&#13;
technology within the Region. We had a central word processing pool at that time, 20&#13;
people, that I managed. And I was a general cheerleader, helping the vice president reach&#13;
out and encourage, recognize people who had done a good job. He was a shy man, so it&#13;
was particularly important that he have someone like me do that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You're smiling, so I assume you liked the job?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Oh, I loved it. I loved it. I think back fondly to all the people I worked&#13;
with there, and it gave me confidence that I could not only do analytical work and deal&#13;
with governments, but that I could also look after people cheerfully and make them feel&#13;
good about their work. So it was a wonderful first experience of people management.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now you've obviously had significant amount of experience with the Bank&#13;
by the time you took this position, but you saw the Bank from a different vantage point.&#13;
Did that change your view of the Bank, and if so, how?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, apart from enjoying the job and my responsibilities and the&#13;
cheerleading role, which I think is important in a large organization, I was seeing the&#13;
beginnings of an ossification process. I saw how inefficient and time consuming and&#13;
costly some of our processes had become. The loan processing procedures were&#13;
becoming very cumbersome. I said earlier, on joining the Bank, that I prided myself on&#13;
how the Bank could deliver on its promises and meet its project schedules. I was seeing&#13;
increasingly that we were less and less to meet our promises because some of the review&#13;
procedures were becoming more and more difficult.&#13;
&#13;
And there was also a highly wasteful fascination with the new information system, an&#13;
effort to develop a management information system which would provide managers with&#13;
real-time information of this and that and so on, and it absorbed millions of dollars&#13;
ultimately and never produced the management information report that anybody could&#13;
use properly. I think that's still true of the Bank, even with SAP.&#13;
&#13;
Other large organizations struggle with getting systems to harmonize. But I saw firstÂ­&#13;
hand how expensive and bumbling and, you know, self-centered large parts ofthe&#13;
institution were becoming, and it worried me. So when Barber [B.] eonable came with&#13;
orders to reorganize the Bank..&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That was my next question.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: .. I was glad of it. I was happy that this structure and the waste were&#13;
going to be shaken up a bit. Later I'll give you an example when I was in the&#13;
organizational planning unit [Institutional Change and Strategy Department]. But still,&#13;
this was my first acquaintance with the actual cost of letting a large organization run&#13;
amok, rather than having real control on the budget and spending.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What did you think about the reorganization itself?&#13;
                                                                                                I&#13;
                                                                                                1&#13;
                                                                                                i&#13;
CALDERISI: I didn't like it in the end because it was very noisy and very costly. Lots&#13;
of people were given very fat packages. There were perverse incentives created in the&#13;
process, and people were jockeying to leave the place. Some very good people left, and&#13;
some very mediocre people had to stay behind because all the money for severance&#13;
                                                                                                \&#13;
                                                                                                I&#13;
packages had been used up. So it was mismanaged on that level. It was also done by a            i&#13;
team of middle-level managers who were very sure of themselves, like Kim [Edward V.&#13;
K.] Jaycox, in particular, who was Vice President for [Western] Africa. And it was done&#13;
without the involvement of the-the most senior stratum of the management, and they&#13;
got into trouble, I think, in the process.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: They brought outside consultants in to drive the whole reorganization?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Let me think who it was ...&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: McKinsey [&amp; Company]?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: McKinsey came in in '96. At that point-I'm not sure - no, I don't&#13;
think there were very many outside consultants, mainly internal study groups chaired by&#13;
people close to Kim Jaycox, who Barber Conable had asked to spearhead the&#13;
reorganization. And actually it was a nice blueprint. I became one of the new country&#13;
operations division chiefs after the dust had settled.&#13;
&#13;
The architecture was fine. What wasn't fine was the overlap between responsibilities,&#13;
between the country director, country operations division chief. And less control on&#13;
country budgets than was intended; that also happened in the '96 reorganization. The&#13;
principles were very good, but the practice very quickly became confused.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Now you had a new position. How did that differ from the position&#13;
that you left?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, I was back in country operations as-as the country operations&#13;
division chief for Indonesia. The country operations division in that structure had noÂ­        ,&#13;
had no involvement in loan processing, as such. Instead, it was the economics and&#13;
strategy division of the department.&#13;
                                                                                               I&#13;
Now, my country director was rather impressive. Not terribly likeable, but nonetheless&#13;
everyone respected him-a character named Russ [Russell J.] Cheetham. He'd been the             \&#13;
director ofthe office in Jakarta for a long time. And to prevent too much of an overlap        ~&#13;
between my and his responsibilities, because he was too proud to have a deputy&#13;
director-he could do everything himself-he focused on Indonesia, and I focused on the&#13;
smaller countries, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific islands. And I also made certain&#13;
that economic work on all the countries, including Indonesia, was coming along soundly,&#13;
respectably. And I focused on some tasks which-particularly in Papua New Guinea and&#13;
the Pacific islands, where my own experience seemed to be most suitable.&#13;
&#13;
But I only stayed there for two years because I didn't like my country director very much,&#13;
and he kept going over my head and terrorizing my staff, my own division, calling them&#13;
at home in the evenings. And I was-I thought it was my job to protect them from him,&#13;
and to give them space to do work at a pace which was reasonable for the Bank but also&#13;
for their families. And I got tired of that, so after two years I decided to move on.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How then-how does one do that? Do you put out the word, or you talk&#13;
to-you saw Adams again?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: No, no, it wasn't succeeding Jim anymore. One of the senior vice&#13;
presidents was Willi Wapenhans, whom I had worked with 10 years before when he was&#13;
Vice President for Eastern Africa. He was now Senior Vice President for External&#13;
Affairs and Administration. And his principal adviser, Alberto De Capitani, from the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Africa Region, was eager to leave. And he let me know, I think, that this job may be&#13;
coming up and I should express an interest, which I did.&#13;
&#13;
And so I applied, and it was a rather amusing process because Willi Wapenhans was&#13;
well-known in the Bank, but what he was really known for was not being able to make up&#13;
his mind on anything.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I've heard that.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: But I really liked him. I was even teased for liking him.&#13;
&#13;
Willi and I had established a good rapport while I was loan officer for Tanzania. He,&#13;
after all, had to chair meetings at which the fearsome Uma Lele was trying to intimidate&#13;
him into canceling projects in Tanzania, and I was speaking up for the country.&#13;
&#13;
And there was-I remember--one long meeting about an integrated rural development&#13;
project in-in northwestern Tanzania, in the Mara region, which was just about to go to&#13;
the Board. And Uma wanted it cancelled, as it just so happened to be the home region of&#13;
Julius Nyerere, so it was plain that it wasn't just a professional act on the part of the&#13;
[Eastern Africa Projects Department, Southern] Agriculture Division chief, Uma Lele,&#13;
but a political one, and I was deeply offended. And so we had some really emotionally&#13;
and professionally tense meetings, which Willi would chair and never come to a decision&#13;
on. In the end, though, the project was dropped. So I think Willi admired my tenacity,&#13;
and also my responsibility in the way I dealt with some fairly tough and sometimes&#13;
obnoxious people. Uma was politer. She had a group of henchmen in her division who&#13;
were foulmouthed and sort of aggressive.&#13;
&#13;
He eventually selected me as his principal adviser, but I had to call him up several times&#13;
to see whether he had come to a decision. He said, "Well, I have to interview, you know,&#13;
one more candidate," so on and so on. I think I just wore him down. [Laughter] But that&#13;
was rather funny, but of course I was very relieved because then I could leave the job I&#13;
was in, going without sort of creating the impression of a disagreement with Russ&#13;
Cheetham. And, as it was a promotion, he couldn't block it.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now this job seems to me a very different kind ofjob from anything you've&#13;
had before because now you're looking at the institution as a whole ..&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And how did that work out?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, it was good. And, again, the part of the job I liked the most was&#13;
the cheerleading. I was able to meet a lot of people, and people would come to me with&#13;
problems that they needed advice on that they couldn't see the vice president about. I did&#13;
a lot of troubleshooting, and I've always liked variety in my work.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I think in my 22 years at the Bank I had something like eleven or twelve jobs, and that's&#13;
quite extraordinary, the longest being on Tanzania, but the others have been relatively&#13;
short.&#13;
&#13;
And one of the things that I was troubleshooter on was something I never expressed an&#13;
interest in doing, but it was something that was very important for staff and the [World&#13;
Bank Group] Staff Association, and that was an issue of U.S. estate tax and how it might&#13;
affect employees of the World Bank if they happen to die while still living in the United&#13;
States. So I took that one on and designed a protection program and oversaw the&#13;
preparation of an estate tax handbook for staff, so they would understand what to do or&#13;
what they ought not to do if they wanted to minimize the chances of being subject to&#13;
estate taxes. This was a highly specialized, almost arcane subject for someone with my&#13;
background to be involved in. But I loved taking it on because it was of such importance&#13;
to people.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Is this where you worked with Morallina [Fanwar] George or ...&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, I was also responsible for relations with the Staff Association, and&#13;
no, I dealt with her predecessor, Ann [W.] Hammond, who was a person of similar&#13;
character, who believed that aggressive representation was better than reactive responses.&#13;
Morallina was already active in the Staff Association. I think that's where I got to know&#13;
her. And people in the Staff Association respected me as someone who was in&#13;
management but still very much feeling a staff member.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Looking at this position overall-again, we talked about how you took on&#13;
the first managerial job in the Bank, your views of the Bank changed. How did this&#13;
position change your views of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, I was hired by Willi Wapenhans, but soon after, Willi was&#13;
succeeded by another man who was, again, one of the lay-saints of the World Bank,&#13;
another Turk, Bilsel Alisbah, who had been the director for Western Africa [Country&#13;
Programs Department I], and everybody thought was the best manager in the Bank. He&#13;
was just loved, not just respected.&#13;
&#13;
And he inherited me and-and we worked very well together, and he showed me how&#13;
much of a difference one person could make, one manager could make in a large&#13;
organization by being very direct, being very relaxed with the Staff Association. There&#13;
had been some tension. In fact, Ann Hammond, the Staff Association chairman, had&#13;
given Bilsel a piece of her mind about me because we had a disagreement about&#13;
something. So our first conversations were a little tense, until I explained the&#13;
background. I think I prepared a rather elaborate summary of all of the issues that Willi&#13;
Wapenhans and the Staff Association had had and, you know, how they'd come out. The&#13;
note provided a sense of how complicated these issues were, so that was a corrective.&#13;
&#13;
But he decided on personnel policies to take on some very sensitive subjects that had&#13;
been irritating people for a long time, and he started sending circulars to staff which had a&#13;

completely different tone. They were conversational, they didn't use jargon, and they&#13;
explained-sometimes at the risk of offending Board members-just why it was going to&#13;
be difficult to do as much as everyone wanted but what could be achieved at this point&#13;
and so on. And I was writing them. So that was fun.&#13;
&#13;
He and I bonded very quickly and the style of his communications with staff were&#13;
refreshing, so refreshing that one person sent him a note and said, "I'm sure other people&#13;
have told you this, but every time a circular comes from your office," you know, "we dig&#13;
it out of our inbox because it's the first thing we want to read. It's the first honest&#13;
communication we've had in this institution. It was almost as if you had a Cyrano de&#13;
Bergerac in your office doing these things," [laughter] and so Bilsel one day passed the&#13;
note to me saying, "This is for you, Cyrano." So that was very satisfying.&#13;
&#13;
It also it proved to me, too, that I had kept some gifts of clarity and communication,&#13;
despite having-by then being ten years in an organization where, you know, people tend           !&#13;
to talk Bankese. I also took away from him, and also what I did with him, just how little&#13;
it can take sometimes to heal and reassure people.&#13;
                                                                                                 {&#13;
I think there is a crying need for that kind of thing now, at this point in Mr. [Paul D.]&#13;
Wolfowitz's presidency. People are really suffering and feeling devalued, and if&#13;
                                                                                                 I&#13;
Wolfowitz hired people that have self confidence and if he started communicating&#13;
directly like that with people, it would make a big difference.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Good morning, today is Friday, April 28, 2006. I'm Bill Becker and I'm to&#13;
conduct the second of the oral history interviews for the Bank's Archives with Robert&#13;
Calderisi. Good to see you again.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: And you.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, you left the position as the senior principal adviser to the Senior Vice&#13;
President for External Affairs and Administration, and you headed back to Africa inÂ­&#13;
between 1991 and 1994, as the Chief, World Bank Regional Mission in Western Africa,&#13;
in the Cote d'Ivoire. Again, I've asked this many times, and you've joked about how&#13;
many positions you've had, so I can ask my standard question about this. What were the&#13;
circumstances that led you to taking that position?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, I thought it was time, after having been away from Africa, from the&#13;
field, for more than ten years--because I'd left Tanzania in 1978--to see actually how aid&#13;
was being felt on the ground. And there was no career reason for going to the field. In&#13;
fact, very many people warned me that it would retard my progress in the Bank, which of&#13;
course was a perverse truth at the time, that when one was away, one was out of mind as&#13;
well. But I was determined to go because I just thought it was right thing to do. It was&#13;
also another way of serving Africa more directly. And I just wanted to see whether aid&#13;
was working. And so, it was a good opportunity for that.&#13;
&#13;
It was a special time in the Cote d'lvoire, or the Ivory Coast, because we were at&#13;
loggerheads with them about what to do. We had been urging the whole of the West&#13;
African franc zone to devalue. For seven years we'd been trying to do this. And we&#13;
finally put them on notice, and particularly the Cote d'lvoire, that we wouldn't lend them&#13;
any more-any significant sums of money--until they devalued.&#13;
&#13;
So, for my first two years there, until they did devalue the franc, I had a lot of time on my&#13;
hands. And I spent it going into the interior, visiting villages, and also helping journalists&#13;
and young people and women's groups understand the issues that were confronting their&#13;
country. And preparing them for what I knew would be a wrenching event-the&#13;
devaluation-which was likely to put the World Bank in the hot seat as a villain rather&#13;
than as a friend ofthe country. So I quite deliberately inoculated public opinion on the&#13;
subject, by giving talks in very simple terms about issues which people hadn't really&#13;
heard the World Bank talk about: access of women to credit, creating small enterprises&#13;
for young people who had left school, and explaining structural adjustment and economic&#13;
reforms related to reducing poverty rather than just making the economy good for&#13;
business and the state.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Robert Calderisi 
&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And all of this paid off because when the devaluation happened, the government then&#13;
asked me to explain it once again to public meetings right across the country, and people&#13;
believed me because I had become quite well known as an explainer of economic&#13;
problems and challenges in ways that people could understand. And ...&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So you're a native French speaker?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, no, my first language is English, but I have been speaking French&#13;
since I was very young, and certainly I had to improve my French even more because,&#13;
journalists being journalists-and they were just stretching their wings, you know, in a&#13;
new multi-party system and a relatively free press-they would try to trip me up initially&#13;
[laughter], and one had to detect trick questions. But I became very popular among the&#13;
press, and I became a media figure, very often on television and the radio. And this was&#13;
a new thing for the Bank, and it pre-dated, of course, Jim Wolfensohn's arrival at the&#13;
Bank in 1995, where he puts a lot of accent on the Bank's external image and speaking&#13;
about the poor rather than just about development. And my work attracted a lot of&#13;
attention.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Did it ruffle feathers?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: No, surprisingly not, except near the end of my stay when, after having&#13;
explained the devaluation, I started complaining it wasn't having all the desired effects&#13;
because the government wasn't following through on some other measures which they&#13;
would have to take in order for the new relative prices to bring benefits for poor people.&#13;
And by then I think the government had got tired of hearing me.&#13;
&#13;
But for the longest time, for two and a half years, my efforts explained what the&#13;
government was doing and what the government still had to do to reduce poverty; it&#13;
helped everyone. My speeches were printed in their entirety in the opposition press. Not&#13;
a word was taken out of it, so I'd found the language which appealed to people. And I&#13;
explained things through telling a story, much as I've done in my book.&#13;
&#13;
And people appreciated that. The government liked it because it made respectable their&#13;
negotiations and arguments at the World Bank because they could see in me, as a&#13;
representative of the Bank, good purpose and values. And it pleased the opposition&#13;
because it lifted the veil of secrecy from debates on which they'd been starved of&#13;
information by the government. And it gave them a handle to beat the government with,&#13;
on things they needed still to do.&#13;
&#13;
I never refused an invitation to talk-after the first six months, anyway, because I thought&#13;
I should shut up until I knew something about the country. And people were prepared to&#13;
hear a great deal from me, but it could have been someone else. But it helped to be a&#13;
Canadian. I couldn't have said the same things if I had been an American or a&#13;
Frenchman.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                             24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And I teased people. I told the people-the business people and others-that the Cote&#13;
d'Ivoire used to set its sights on what Indonesia and Malaysia and Brazil were doing.&#13;
Now they were comparing themselves with Togo, Zaire and Chad in order to feel good&#13;
about themselves. I would say, "Look, those aren't the kinds of comparators you should&#13;
be using. You should be going back to those old horizons." And they smiled because&#13;
they knew it was true.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: And this is a country that was one of the success stories of Africa which&#13;
was slowly turning sour. And now, of course, since it's exploded into civil war.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
From what you say, your approach was different from your predecessors'. You said that&#13;
generally your approach was welcomed at the Bank. Not trying to create a controversy&#13;
where there isn't a controversy, it just strikes me that it's a bit different from the way the&#13;
Bank had approached things.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: It was tremendously supported at the Bank. Of course, I was a fairly&#13;
senior staff member to be in the field at that point, and I had the experience and the selfÂ­&#13;
confidence to make speeches. I wrote all my own talks without clearing them at&#13;
headquarters, and so that meant that they were fresh and personal. And people at&#13;
headquarters found my approach not just appropriate but something to model, and other&#13;
people in the field were encouraged to do the same. And the Vice President for Africa,&#13;
Kim Jaycox, was a real fan, and he and the chief economist of the Region kept helping&#13;
me with sort of ideas and information which I could use in defending the Bank's&#13;
purposes. So all around it was quite a good story.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In your book, you have taken a very distinct point of view about African&#13;
leaders and African governments, and I'll ask you some more about that a little later. But&#13;
when did those ideas begin to take shape and, more specifically, did this experience on&#13;
the ground in the '90s have much to do with these ideas, or had you formed them earlier,&#13;
or perhaps even later?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: No, I think being in Africa in the early '90s, informed by my experience&#13;
ofIndonesia and East Asia generally, was decisive. I was not just struck; I was appalled&#13;
by the clash in values between what I saw in Cote d'Ivoire and what I imagined a&#13;
properly running government should be. And anybody who came to Cote d'Ivoire at the&#13;
time noticed it. The Chinese Executive Director at the time and later one of the&#13;
managing directors of the Bank, Shengman Zhang, when he came for a visit, told me in&#13;
my car as we drove back into town that people thought China was an authoritarian state,&#13;
but if ministers sported French suits and gold watches and there were garish mansions&#13;
side by side with slums in China, there would be another revolution in 24 hours. I&#13;
thought that was very perceptive on the part of somebody who'd only spent two or three&#13;
days in Cote d'Ivoire. And, of course, it was an extreme example of what was&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
happening. But later I saw other countries, to a smaller extent, where this gulf in values&#13;
or living conditions was also great.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So this did reinforce some ideas that had been developing within that&#13;
experience?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Very deeply.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, you said the government there for the first two-and-half-years was&#13;
cooperative, or supportive, of what you were doing. What happened in the last six&#13;
months? [Inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: I didn't want to stay on anyway, so it wasn't a problem for me to go.&#13;
And I rather thought it was probably a good idea to have a changing of the guard. I had&#13;
no regrets about what I'd done, and no regrets about leaving, either.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Who succeeded you?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Shigeo Katsu, who's now the Vice President for Europe and Central&#13;
Asia, a Japanese man for whom Cote d'Ivoire was also an important assignment. And he&#13;
had a very different style, a very different personality, but that's one ofthe benefits of&#13;
this organization.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You came back then to Washington and took, at least to an outsider, it looks&#13;
like a very different job yet again. Between '94 and '96 you were the deputy secretary&#13;
ofthe Development Committee's Task Force on the Future of the Multilateral&#13;
Development Banks. Quite a mouthful. But again, how did that come about, and what&#13;
were your responsibilities?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, like most senior people who'd been in the field, people had trouble&#13;
placing us once we got home, even though you'd think it was one of the human resource&#13;
issues you could manage quite well because you knew three years ahead of time that the&#13;
person would be coming back. But there was very little available for me at the time, and&#13;
the Bank was about to go into another bout of reorganization, and until the dust settled it&#13;
was not clear what positions would be available. So I was asked if I would be willing to&#13;
serve on this international commission which the Development Committee had created,&#13;
and I said fine. Willi Wapenhans was the secretary of the task force, and it was he who&#13;
expressed an interest in my doing this work with him.&#13;
&#13;
But rather in the same way that I was immediately put off by the work at the OECD in&#13;
the first few weeks, I saw that this study was going to be stillborn. And I tried to bail out. tfJ&#13;
And I talked to several senior people, including [S.] Shahid Husain, who was the               ~&#13;
Vice President, Management and Personnel Services, at the time, and Gautam [S.] Kaji, 0&#13;
who was one of the MDs [Managing Directors J and a former boss and friend. And                 ~&#13;
           told me that I would have to         for the sake of the                            ~&#13;

                                 I stayed-I did that work out of the sense of duty and            c::::.&#13;
necessity, and really on the orders ofthe senior management of the institution.                   U&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What were the issues that this committee was supposed to be looking into?&#13;
                                                                                              ~   ~&#13;
                                                                                                           '1Â­&#13;
                                                                                                           &amp;f&#13;
CALDERISI: It was supposed to develop better means of coordination and, if possible,&#13;
a division oflabor between the World Bank and the five regional development banks. It&#13;
was hoped that the regional banks could be given a greater share of responsibility and&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 I&#13;
total lending volumes in the regions and the Bank could become a kind of a reference&#13;
hospital rather than a provider of first-line services. The idea was sound, but it ran into&#13;
the problems of institutional inertia everywhere at the Bank, not wanting to get out of&#13;
retail lending activities and just providing policy advice.                                                      I&#13;
                                                                                                                 â&#128;¢&#13;
And in the case of the regional institutions, they did not want to be reduced to simple                          f&#13;
deliverers of money. They also wanted to have a role in spreading global knowledge&#13;
about development. So, it was an elegant idea that ran into the shoals of the interests of&#13;
the individual institutions.&#13;
&#13;
The president of the Inter-American Development Bank was the most explicit in putting&#13;
the regional banks' point of view. He actually invited the team to sit in the IADB offices&#13;
                                                                                                                 I&#13;
down on New York Avenue so that we would not feel a captive of the World Bank. But&#13;
he argued that the banks should be competitors, not coordinators, and that everybody&#13;
would be better off if the official institutions just competed for business and clients,&#13;
which was a peculiar but honest opinion on his part.&#13;
                                                                                                                 I&#13;
The final report had some interesting suggestions, but nothing really earth-shattering.                          t&#13;
And apart from the brief discussion at the Development Committee in the spring&#13;
meetings in 1996, it was shelved.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Some of the ideas seem to precede Wolfensohn's ideas about a knowledge&#13;
                                                                                                                 I&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
things slow down as he adjusts. Is that part of this problem here, too, or ...&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, Wolfensohn came on June 1, 1995, and the report was largely&#13;
finished in August and submitted in '95, and Wolfensohn met with the task force.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I was going to ask if he had.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: He had met with the task force a few times. But I think he saw it as an&#13;
opportunity to expand the World Bank influence [laughter] rather than to diminish it.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                             27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And he seized on the recommendation of the task force that there be semiannual meetings&#13;
of the five regional banks and the World Bank to exchange ideas and experience. And&#13;
he-he was quite keen on--on that, but, then again, I say it was more about expanding&#13;
the World Bank's wings--and even writ--than about cutting back to the essential services&#13;
that the Bank could offer.&#13;
&#13;
It was one of Wolfensohn' s great failings--maybe his greatest failing, in my view--that he&#13;
did not respond to the swelling up of interest within the Bank and the senior managers to&#13;
be more selective in what the Bank did. In the first six months that he was here, at&#13;
meetings with all the managers, he was constantly being asked, "Why can't we give up&#13;
doing this or that?" and "How do you see focusing the Bank's working in your first&#13;
term?"&#13;
&#13;
He would say, "Look, it's far too early for us to give anything up. We have the talent, we&#13;
have the resources, people outside expect the World Bank to do certain things, and I&#13;
don't think we should stop doing anything as long as we can continue doing those things&#13;
well."&#13;
&#13;
Well, we didn't want to pour cold water on his enthusiasm, but we all knew that the Bank&#13;
was doing a lot of things in a mediocre way, and we were eager to do a smaller number of&#13;
things very well. That problem has yet to be fixed, ten years later.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So you left this job in '96. How is it that you came to be the senior manager&#13;
for the Institutional Change and Strategy Department?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: That was another holding operation because of the reorganization of the&#13;
Bank at that point. And no one wanted to put me into an operational position for just a&#13;
few months. It was also thought that I'd had a diverse enough experience of the Bank to&#13;
contribute to that reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
So, I was the deputy director of this group, which was basically an organizational&#13;
planning department, but it had the fancy title of Institutional Change and Strategy&#13;
Department. As the senior manager, I managed the staff of the department. And the&#13;
director, Ngozi [N.] Okonjo-Iweala, who's now the finance minister of Nigeria, was-Â­&#13;
looked after the external work ofthe department, dealing with the "clients," the internal&#13;
clients of the department and the senior managers and participating in all the task forces&#13;
and committees that were reshaping the Bank with the help of McKinsey &amp; Company.&#13;
&#13;
And-and so I had for whatever it was-nine months, maybe a little longer-the&#13;
thankless job of managing thirty management experts, who of course never think they&#13;
should be managed. I got them very upset because I tried to impose work schedules and&#13;
targets and budgets, and I tried cutting back on their fees because some of these people&#13;
had been working continuously for the Bank for two or three years and drawing $1,500 a&#13;
day for their services, which you could justify for three-, four-day assignments elsewhere&#13;
in the World Bank at the time, for really high-level, scarce skills, but it was, I thought,&#13;
dishonest, almost criminal, to be spending all this money on people who were now&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                        28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
essentially staff because four of their five working days a week were at the Bank. And&#13;
we whittled down the number of external consultants who were pulling those salaries.&#13;
And of course, I was quite disliked, but I had satisfaction in time of reducing the budget&#13;
of the department from something like $13 million to just over $6 million. And that was,&#13;
strangely enough, a satisfYing achievement.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Most of the staff was outside consultants?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Yes. Most of them were. And-and the internal consultants, you know,&#13;
wasted money in other ways, and I tried to curb them as well. I mean, they were&#13;
prepared to pay $2,000 a day to somebody to do flow chart cartoons, recording&#13;
brainstorming sessions. It was just amazing. And so, we actually reformed [laughter] the&#13;
Institutional Change and Strategy Department in the Bank, which was paradoxical. But&#13;
that was the only satisfaction I got. And, again, I did it out of a sense of duty to the&#13;
organization and also a sense of realism. Until the Bank was properly reorganized, there&#13;
wouldn't be all that many interesting jobs to be had, anyway.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Was Wolfensohn interested in what this department was nominally doing?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, he was nominally interested in the reorganization, but, in fact, he&#13;
distanced himself from it because he knew people were getting angry, and he didn't want&#13;
to be tarred with it the way Barber Conable had been in 1987. Wolfensohn wanted to be&#13;
seen as an effective reformer, a transforming manager, but wasn't interested in the&#13;
details. And he had very uneven interest in the subject, and he wasn't much involved in&#13;
follow-through and communicating the reasons for the change, even though the literature&#13;
suggests that the most important thing is having a clear strategy that people can buy into&#13;
and then having a strong executive who will sell the message at all levels. That was&#13;
lacking.&#13;
&#13;
The only strategy the Bank really was developing at that point was through ancillary&#13;
activities like measurement or public communication. You know, "Let's measure our&#13;
work better," but what measures should we choose? It was in the choice of the measures&#13;
that one got some kind of strategic choices involved. And, similarly, with&#13;
communications: What's the message? And it was only very late in the process that a&#13;
proper strategy was developed, again with McKinsey's involvement.&#13;
&#13;
But Wolfensohn was very poor as a change leader. He was just bored with the subject.&#13;
He wanted to be outside the walls doing development work. So that was the end of that.&#13;
It was a flop.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, did McKinsey work in other levels in the Bank, or was their primary&#13;
contact in the Bank through this department?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Oh, they didn't work for us.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, I see.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Their client was the change group--it was the managing directors, who&#13;
were running this program. And we, too, we serving them. We paid the bills.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So you didn't have the control over those consultants? They were&#13;
somewhere else?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: They were single-sourced, and nobody questioned their fees. It was&#13;
quite-it was quite upsetting to traditionalists in the Bank, who felt they should have&#13;
competed for that work.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And then you moved on to external affairs manager and became a&#13;
spokesman for Africa?                                                                           I&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, yes, that was peculiar-what happened was that I was actually                   I&#13;
selected as country director--one of the new country directors-for Thailand by the new&#13;
Vice President for East Asia, lean-Michel Severino, whom I had known when he was the&#13;
head of French aid in Paris and he used to visit Abidjan. And-and so he-he selected&#13;
                                                                                                I&#13;
me for Thailand, and, in fact, he called me up just before I was leaving on a holiday in&#13;
France to say that I might have to come back early for management transition briefings&#13;
and so on.&#13;
                                                                                                I&#13;
Unfortunately, he had vetted his list but hadn't quite got complete buy-in by the&#13;
Managing Directors, and one of the Managing Directors, Caio [K.] Koch-Weser, decided&#13;
that I should go to this other job I'd applied for in the Africa Region as a fallback because&#13;
they still had other senior people to place and, "Robert is good, you know, likes Africa,&#13;
and he's a good communicator." So he suggested that I be sent there.&#13;
&#13;
Well, I was, of course, very upset, very close to leaving the Bank, thinking that this is&#13;
rather offensive to have been selected-I was told by the members of the short-listing&#13;
committee that I had been ranked very high and they, too, felt the process had been&#13;
abused by having a Managing Director overrule the recommendations of the short-listing&#13;
committee. And so all around it was upsetting. But, I thought, "No, it's a little early to&#13;
leave the Bank." And I loved the idea oftrying to improve the Bank's message in Africa,&#13;
as I had tried to do on a smaller scale in the Ivory Coast. But it was a letdown, certainly.&#13;
I wanted to be one of the first country directors in the new structure, and as it turned out,&#13;
I had to wait a few years before becoming a country director for Central Africa. I licked&#13;
my wounds, and I was a good soldier.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I read some of the statements that were made at that time. Given your views&#13;
about Africa, how difficult was this job to do?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, I'd already developed some skills in defending the Bank-the big&#13;
bad wolf-in Africa, so I wasn't intimidated by journalists or crowds of students and the&#13;
like. And I-I loved the work. In a sense, I'm back to doing it now with this book. I&#13;
enjoyed it, a debate for a good cause, not just to win a point.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                          30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: And there were only two drawbacks: one was that you can't really talk&#13;
generally about development. The best public information is about local examplesÂ­&#13;
down the street or across town. So stories I used to tell in Cote d'lvoire were strong&#13;
because people could identify with people I was talking about. But when you talked&#13;
about Africa in general, it was much harder to find examples that people felt were telling&#13;
in their own lives.&#13;
&#13;
So, at that level of generalization it was harder job to do, and secondly, more importantly,&#13;
we were never given the budget resources necessary to do it professionally. We had only&#13;
two professionals in the unit, and I prepared a three-year strategy which called on our&#13;
                                                                                               I&#13;
                                                                                               I&#13;
                                                                                               ,&#13;
                                                                                               ~;&#13;
having five or six professionals, and a large budget for publicity, scholarships, and          r&#13;
                                                                                               I&#13;
information tours bringing teams of Bank experts to particular places and introducing the&#13;
African public to issues which were important for them. Not just about the Bank, but&#13;
Africa and-and its challenges. And they would say, "It's all very nice, but we don't&#13;
have the money." So it was-it was a real handicap. But I did the best I could with the&#13;
resources we had.&#13;
&#13;
And a lot of my time was spent firefighting rather than doing strategic communication,&#13;
but some of that firefighting was also important, including defending our right to consider&#13;
financing the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline, which was an immense controversy, one of&#13;
the biggest the Bank has ever faced. And I spent three years as the World Bank's&#13;
spokesman for Africa, defending our right to study the project. And then the last two&#13;
years of my career, as country director for Chad and Cameroon, actually doing it, so it&#13;
was a nice way of ending my career on a subject that involved both debate and real&#13;
development experience.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I was going to ask you about the pipeline in connection with the next job, but&#13;
since you brought it up, what was-what was the nature of the debate?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, the debate was: could you really trust the two corrupt governments&#13;
and three international oil companies with bad reputations to do it properly? There were&#13;
issues of environment; there were issues of human rights; and most important, how to&#13;
ensure that the oil revenues would be used responsibly when the whole history of natural&#13;
resource boom management in the developing world had been terrible, except in&#13;
Indonesia, as we talked about earlier, and Botswana. And so the project had to respond&#13;
to those concerns. Approaches had to be very different, and it was done very differently.&#13;
All kinds of special mechanisms were introduced to insulate the oil revenues from&#13;
misuse.&#13;
&#13;
And while there was no proving of prior guarantees imaginable, it had to be tried. The&#13;
ultimate defense of the project-and I used it on National Public Radio the day before the&#13;
Board discussion-was there was no way of guaranteeing that 100 percent of the oil&#13;
revenues would be used to reduce poverty. The only thing we could guarantee was that if&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
the oil project didn't go ahead, not a single penny of that money would go to reducing&#13;
poverty. That was really the challenge.&#13;
&#13;
Since then, the government has violated the agreement, changed the law on the allocation&#13;
of oil revenues, and the Bank has suspended its operations in the country, as it should.&#13;
But jll;st yesterday they reached a compromise, which mayor may not lead to a&#13;
resumption of the project. The Bank is resuming its operations. My own belief is that&#13;
not only should the World Bank shut down its operations in Chad but other donors should&#13;
do so as well. And ExxonMobil should stop using the pipeline until Chad recovers its&#13;
senses. It's kind of a tough, but we promised the world that we would implement these&#13;
agreements. And once they were violated, we had to take action.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Has the government changed?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: No.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I assume that a lot of the criticism of the project before it was undertaken&#13;
was criticism mainly coming from NOOs.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Yes. Namely, American NOOs, some of whom had never been to Chad&#13;
or Cameroon. And they got up to mischief.&#13;
&#13;
I took on the most vocal of these critics from the Environmental Defense Fund, a woman&#13;
named Korinna Horta. And we were constantly on the radio or being quoted back-toÂ­&#13;
                                                                                                              1&#13;

back in newspaper articles. I did my best to counter her criticism, and then later, when I&#13;
became country director, to do everything I could to involve her and reduce her level of&#13;
                                                                                                     -&#13;

BECKER: Chad is.

&#13;
CALDERISI: Cameroon has made itself poor over the years, but now, you know, it's 
&#13;
an oil producer, and recently doing very well. 
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Were the control measures part of the agreements; were there to be periodic 
&#13;
reviews; and were there in fact the people on the ground who could certify that things 
&#13;
were going as they were supposed to? 
&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: All of the above and more.

&amp;#12;                                                                                         32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: It was so overloaded some people thought, "My goodness, it might not&#13;
even fly." The oil revenues would be put into an overseas account, and the government&#13;
will only have access to the oil revenues if a watchdog committee set up within Chad,&#13;
consisting not just of parliamentarians but also human rights advocates and NGO&#13;
representatives and religious leaders, said that the government had developed appropriate&#13;
plans for using this money for the poor and was actually implementing these once the&#13;
money was dispensed, and so that they could get the second installment and so on. That&#13;
was one part of it.&#13;
&#13;
The government itself had passed a law in the National Assembly which promised to&#13;
spend 80 percent ofthe oil revenues on development activities: roads, schools, clinics,&#13;
environment, and-and the like. And there were to be annual published audits of the oil&#13;
accounts and what the oil companies were putting into the account. There were going to&#13;
be intensified supervision missions from the World Bank, and there was going to be an&#13;
international advisory group, independent of the Bank and the government, funded&#13;
independently as well, which would make visits three or four times a year for the first ten&#13;
years to make certain that the agreements were being respected in every respect and that&#13;
people along the pipeline route had been treated properly and paid compensation for&#13;
temporary loss of their lands and so on. It was quite a structure.&#13;
&#13;
It was an unprecedented abridgement of national sovereignty. Some people thought it&#13;
might be a model. Others, including one ofthe Latin American executive directors at the&#13;
Bank, said, "Don't expect any other country to be as poor and as desperate as Chad to&#13;
want to accept such silly conditions."&#13;
&#13;
My view is that we should have been even more demanding. As it turns out, even ifthe&#13;
watchdog committee had said that the government wasn't using funds properly or hadn't&#13;
prepared proper spending plans, there was no way that the Bank could actually freeze the&#13;
account or stop the flow of the funds coming. And we decided we just had to leave some&#13;
things to trust, and we thought international opinion and the leverage we had with our&#13;
own program would be enough to discourage the hanky-panky. I think we should have&#13;
made it explicit that the Bank could close that account. And I think we should have made&#13;
it explicit, too, that oil companies would stop using the pipeline, if necessary.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I was going to ask about the role of the oil companies.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: The oil companies wanted the Bank there in order to do this investment&#13;
soundly vis-a.-vis their shareholders and international public opinion. And so I think they&#13;
should have also agreed to stop using the pipeline if the government violated the&#13;
agreement.&#13;
&#13;
The government did violate the agreement, and to their surprise the Bank did close the&#13;
account. But that was because under the arrangement the overseer bank-more&#13;
specifically, Citibank--closed the account, because as soon as they were informed by the&#13;
World Bank that the government was in violation of agreements, they were required to&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
allow the account to accumulate enough funds to permit the lenders to recover their&#13;
investments.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, after two years of this ...&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: No, three years. It was three years as-as Bank spokesmen, and then I&#13;
became country director for two years.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Country director, right.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: That was my last job.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. So in 2000, you become the country director for Central Africa,&#13;
which, you know, included, Cameroon and Chad. Now, how did that happen?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, the previous director for those countries was a man named Serge&#13;
Michailof, a French citizen who had been an adviser for a long time in the front office.&#13;
And he decided to leave that job to take another position as adviser. And I was one of&#13;
several candidates who were short-listed for the position. And, of course, I had the&#13;
advantage of the languages as well because they're all French-speaking countries except&#13;
for Equatorial Guinea, which speaks Spanish, but we didn't have much of a program&#13;
there.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You talked a bit about the pipeline. What other issues or problems had you&#13;
endured?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: In those countries?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, they're one ofthe worst set of countries imaginable. There's a&#13;
chapter in my book about them.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: They disliked each other but, you know, they had to live with each other.&#13;
And we had a pretty large program in Chad. We had an important program in Cameroon.&#13;
We had a dwindling program in Gabon. We had basically an impasse in the Central&#13;
African Republic. And we had in Equatorial Guinea suddenly a very rich oil producer&#13;
who didn't need our money but was interested in borrowing from the Bank for&#13;
infrastructure and other purposes and hence take advantage of the technical expertise&#13;
here. So it was quite a diverse range of clients.&#13;
&#13;
To me the most creative part was trying to get something going in the Central African&#13;
Republic and Equatorial Guinea, but I was stymied for a number of reasons. And I tried&#13;
to shut down programs in Gabon because even the two projects we were doing were not&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                        and as a first      I decided we'd close the office in Gabon.&#13;
&#13;
                                 the office itself was absorbing about 40 percent of the IZl&#13;
country budget. I thought we could use that money better at headquarters. 	             ~~&#13;
                                                                                                   C"oooI&#13;

                  .    but-but we did . 	                                                     ~~   C)       ~&#13;
                                                                                              ai   ~        Â§&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            1&#13;
But it was the typical-let me give you another example of lack of management resolve,&#13;
which frustrated me by that time in my career, and also an example of how limited the&#13;
actual powers of a country director were. You couldn't even close one of your offices.&#13;
The frustration of the Central African Republic was they hadn't had any Bank assistance&#13;
for a long time, and they had suddenly a prime minister who seemed serious and clean,&#13;
and all he needed was $10 million to sort of tide himself over a particularly bad patch. I&#13;
was prepared to provide program assistance in exchange for some reforms, and I was&#13;
blocked the whole way from my vice president up through the senior level ofthe Bank,&#13;
that no, we've put enough bad money into this country.&#13;
&#13;
In Equatorial Guinea, too, I tried pulling something out of the fire, but the country still&#13;
had too malodorous a reputation to engage with. I think the Bank was very shortsighted.&#13;
But at that point I was seeing the end of the road.&#13;
&#13;
Then things got nasty in the last twelve-month around the pipeline. And there was a lot&#13;
ofpoliticization of this and personal vendettas. So I grew tired of it, and decided it was&#13;
time to leave the Bank, as I was at an age and seniority which allowed me to leave there&#13;
with a more than respectable pension, so I seized the-the opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
It was an unbalanced and unpleasant final assignment at the Bank, but one that, you&#13;
know, I put into the context of a very rich and very satisfying career here. And I used the&#13;
real excuse of my parents' failing health in Montreal to go back. And most-many&#13;
people here said, "Why would you give up such an influential position at the peak of your&#13;
powers?" ~d so on. But the African staff sent an email saying how wonderful, we wish&#13;
we could go home and look after our parents. And one said, you know, that "Allah will&#13;
bless you," and "the Koran says the son who looks after his parents is twice blessed," and&#13;
soon.&#13;
&#13;
It was a combination of things. I guess I was losing faith in official aid, and of course I'd&#13;
been in a large organization for thirty years, and I was kind of a little worn out. And so it&#13;
was a nice opportunity to change gears and start a new semi-career [laughter] out of the&#13;
basement of my home in Montreal. So, as I say, it was bittersweet, but, of course, it was&#13;
a great privilege to serve as a country director in my last two years in the Bank.&#13;

&#13;
BECKER: Now, I'd like to turn to your book. Obviously, this is not something that just&#13;
came up; this is something that you've been thinking about for a long time. When did&#13;
you first start, well, forming the ideas that basically inform the book?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, I think I hoped to write the book when I left the Bank. I didn't&#13;
have any clear idea of what shape it would take, but I didn't want it to just be a memoir.&#13;
I wanted it to be a contribution to the debate on how to help Africa, and I thought I had&#13;
enough personal stories and also experience of writing things in a friendly way for a&#13;
general reader that there'd be a lot of stories in it. So I-I went back to notes and&#13;
journals I'd kept and also the manuscript of a book I'd written about my three years in the&#13;
Ivory Coast, which had almost been published by Harper Collins in the summer of '95,&#13;
but then they decided against it as being neither general enough for a generalist reader         !&#13;
                                                                                                 I&#13;
nor specialized enough for a specialized reader. And there was a lot of other material that&#13;
I could use, and so I just started this once I was in Montreal.&#13;
&#13;
One of the interesting developments was that in my own manuscript, which I finished in&#13;
December of '94, I put my own personal experience into an appendix rather than into the&#13;
main body, thinking that if I want to go bookshop to buy a book on Africa I wouldn't&#13;
want to read about the author in the first few pages. I'd be willing to accept that the man&#13;
                                                                                                 I&#13;
                                                                                                 I&#13;
                                                                                                 !&#13;
                                                                                                 t&#13;
knew about the subject he was writing.&#13;
&#13;
And then S1. Martin's Press expressed an interest in the book, and this-but, you know,&#13;
then I submitted a revised version with a longer appendix. And it was they who said,&#13;
"Bring it forward. Everybody here finds this-your story absolutely engaging. And it&#13;
will soften the blow of some of your hard judgments later in the book if they know&#13;
you've spent a lot of time in Africa, not just in offices but in people's homes and in&#13;
villages and the like, and will explain and make it more personal and appealing as an&#13;
account." I think that was good advice because many people have pointed to that&#13;
personal side of the book as distinguishing it from others. And, of course, the fact that&#13;
I'm making some suggestions about how to do things differently, rather than just add to&#13;
the general gloom, is seen as positive.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: When I read the book, the term that came to mind was "tough love." But did&#13;
you ever raise them to an official level while in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, I hadn't formulated them in enough detail to float anything in&#13;
particular, and, after all, I always had a job to do. In my chapter an foreign aid, I explain&#13;
that once you were given the challenge, you want to do it as well as you possibly can,&#13;
even if you think you're dealing with criminals. It's your job to find a way of helping the&#13;
country even through those criminals, which is why we keep making excuses for&#13;
governments as long as you're in an agency. And except for general references to the&#13;
fact that we could do with less resources and that a smaller IDA [International&#13;
Development Association] would be a better IDA, which I've always felt, no, I didn't&#13;
want to test my personal views on anyone.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I was forced to be much more specific when, in writing the book, I said to myself, "All of&#13;
this is easy to say, but what-what can one do that would be different and constructive?"&#13;
And so out of my own experience I drew some tentative suggestions for doing things&#13;
differently.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: But-but no, they didn't exist in my head as a program before I was&#13;
actually forced into filling a blank piece of paper with suggestions that would be&#13;
understandable to the layman and yet would also be faithful to the experience&#13;
development professionals have had, which is that aid that only works with governments&#13;
already doing the right thing for their own reasons, rather than to impress others.&#13;
&#13;
And-and, secondly, that we have to try to be more focused, which has been a theme&#13;
under successive managements at the Bank and at many international conferences. And&#13;
we can't-we refuse to be selective. So, many of my suggestions are just forcing to a&#13;
starker conclusion trends that have already been developing in the aid community for a&#13;
very long time.&#13;
&#13;
Now, in fact, when I launched the book here at the Bank on March 23 [2006], some&#13;
people in the audience said, "Well, most of your ideas are already in the aid dialogue with&#13;
countries."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Maybe that's true. But perhaps we should stop dialoguing and start doing."&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah. Well, that was my question. Again, the book is out a short time, and I&#13;
think you said it hasn't been reviewed formally yet. But how was it received when you&#13;
made this presentation in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, I also made another presentation this morning to the Friday&#13;
Morning Group about the book. And it was quite well received, including from Africans.&#13;
I want the general reader to be angry two-thirds of the way through the book but also&#13;
have some light-hearted moments on the way, so that there will be a real interest in what&#13;
to do about it.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: This brings up the question of the role of the Catholic Church, for one, but&#13;
I'm really thinking other Christian churches who were involved heavily in Africa as well.&#13;
You talk about the Church, obviously, in the book, but what do you see as the role for&#13;
non-Bank groups in making possible some of the things you're talking about?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, you know, churches already provide large portions of services to&#13;
the poor. In Cameroon, for example, the Christian churches provide at least 40 percent of&#13;
rural health and education services. So it's those kinds of things which are most needed&#13;
and most valuable, and so the-the more the Christian church in Africa and their&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
supporters outside of Africa can move money to villages and communities through&#13;
tightly-supervised small projects, the better. And-not just because the services are&#13;
delivered, but also because it bolsters a morale and purpose in these local communities,&#13;
and the motivation is so much clearer than the objectives behind official aid.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Let's talk about AIDS. How's that to be dealt with?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, there's no chapter in the book on AIDS because there's no chapter&#13;
in Africa on AIDS: it affects everything. And so there are frequent references to it as a&#13;
problem in the book.&#13;
&#13;
The most profound change has to be in improving women's control over their own&#13;
reproductive or sexual lives-which, of course, is a very, very long-term challenge in&#13;
Africa--being able to say no to their husband or at least insist that they wear condoms.&#13;
And secondly, it's about giving women who want access to contraceptive services or&#13;
family-planning services that access, rather than--than denying it or considering it&#13;
unimportant. And third, of course, it requires targeted information about how the disease&#13;
is spread. But all of this is being done. It just has to be accelerated and pushed by&#13;
African governments, rather than outsiders. It's-it's getting the shoe on the right foot&#13;
that's important.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I was encouraged to read in the Financial Times a few weeks ago that the actual&#13;
coverage of infected Africans with anti-retroviral medicines is rising. It's, I think, 17&#13;
percent. The only other parts of the world where it's higher is in the [United] States and&#13;
Europe. And 1 wouldn't have predicted that five years ago. I would have predicted it&#13;
would be very, very, very hard to push up that number even beyond 5 percent, given&#13;
conditions in Africa. So it's not hopeless. But there has to be a greater focus on political&#13;
commitment to do that.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Talking about politics and governments and all, how do you go from the&#13;
recognition that the problems in Africa have a lot to do with governments in Africa?&#13;
How do you go from that understanding to actually getting these governments to change?&#13;
And, obviously, it would change at different rates in different places. But what's to be&#13;
the mechanism to do that?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: My history professor in Montreal, who's now 80, when he was looking at&#13;
the manuscript said, "Really, you have to put in some over-arching political theory of&#13;
change in Africa for this to hang together." [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
1 said, "1 don't see an over-arching political theory."&#13;
&#13;
That-that people, given the opportunity to choose and express themselves, will seize&#13;
those opportunities, and they take different forms in different places and times. The&#13;
political systems, like economies, will respond quite quickly once you start doing the&#13;
right thing. It's like the human body-it's quite forgiving. If you've been abusing it for&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a while [laughter], start eating properly and doing some exercise, you see the effects quite&#13;
quickly.&#13;
&#13;
My only theory is that so few Africans have seen what good government is about, so if&#13;
you give them a little bit of good government, people will expect more for it and will&#13;
insist on it. And if we deny aid to governments that are conspicuously bad, then they're&#13;
going to become fragile. They'll fold, they'll collapse on their own, or they'll be pushed.&#13;
And so I hope that by removing the props of easy foreign aid that more governments will&#13;
change in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
That's a bit of a pious hope, but I don't see any other solution. I don't think we should be&#13;
toppling governments from outside. I don't see regime change, the Iraqi kind.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, right. One thing-well, I'll ask two more questions; I know it's been a&#13;
long haul here. A couple of questions further. It's the question about how is South&#13;
Africa perceived. Is South Africa a place that other Africans look up to?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: No, South Africa is still resented by many Africans, certainly by the&#13;
immediate neighbors because since majority rule South African goods are circulating&#13;
much more easily in neighboring markets, competing with and sometimes killing other&#13;
industries in those markets. And it's not a two-way street because South African tariffs&#13;
are much higher than those in neighboring countries, so they can't compete in the other&#13;
direction, even if they are fairly efficient producers.&#13;
&#13;
Also, South African investors, mostly white, have been fanning across Africa for the last&#13;
ten years, buying up companies and-and replacing them with South African managers,&#13;
again, I guess, often white managers. And the domestic economy of South Africa has&#13;
still to change profoundly enough for people to feel the benefits of majority rule in their&#13;
daily lives and for other Africans to think that this is a different place from the one that&#13;
they knew about.&#13;
&#13;
But of course, there's also hope and pride that this is one country that doesn't need aid&#13;
and will never ask for it and which has demonstrated the possibility of doing remarkable&#13;
things.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: South Africa has many, many problems, but its government runs pretty well,&#13;
so it's a model for other parts of Africa.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, it's a Commonwealth country, too. South Africa has had a system&#13;
of liberal democracy since 1910, since it became a republic, and there was a&#13;
parliamentary system and independent judiciary and free press. And even at the height of&#13;
the apartheid, the courts and the press were relatively independent.&#13;
&#13;
Now, of course, the big difference in South Africa, as in England until the late 19th&#13;
century, is most people didn't get to vote. It was a very select, small number of people,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and they were all white. But the institutions of representative government have had a&#13;
long track record in South Africa.&#13;
&#13;
Now that sounds a little-a little dispassionate as a description of South Africa under&#13;
apartheid. But I think it's probably fair to say that-that the black population of South&#13;
Africa has benefited indirectly from that, even when they weren't empowered by the&#13;
system. And I say in my book that Africans living in South Africa under apartheid, in&#13;
material terms, were probably better off than any other African country. They were&#13;
supposed to be free. Freedom's worth a lot more than-than material needs. But many&#13;
countries in Africa had neither.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption1&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
One other point about your book and some of your recommendations about the future of&#13;
the Bank: how did you come to those conclusions, and ...&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, a lot of our time at the Bank was taken up with arguments with the&#13;
IMF or with the United Nations Development Program. And we were often offering rival&#13;
advice to the same government, and it seemed so wasteful of time and inconsiderate to&#13;
the countries.&#13;
&#13;
So how do you fix that? It seemed to me that one way would be to bring the rivalry&#13;
inside four walls rather than across 19th Street or between Washington and New York.&#13;
And it's not a completely outlandish idea; people are already talking-have talked about&#13;
merging the-the IMF and the Bank. I suggest this is more coherent because it would&#13;
respond to a general ambition within the United Nations system to have a new&#13;
development institution that was both more effective and more representative of the&#13;
membership.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I tend to be old-fashioned in thinking the membership of the Bank and the IMF is&#13;
already good as it is. And you don't want a fully democratic system, with one nation, one&#13;
vote. I rather like the idea of a shareholding which reflects the relative economic power,&#13;
and hence interests, of people concerned. However, you can define that differently. I&#13;
mean, you might argue that larger poor countries have a larger interest in what the Bank&#13;
does than the larger rich countries. But it would be very complicated to effect that&#13;
merger. I'm making it as a suggestion to force the question to be asked and answered,&#13;
"Why not?" You know, what is it about the current system which is better than a&#13;
different one?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. And, finally, personally, what has the Bank experience and your&#13;
career meant to you?&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Well, I think the-the word which will always stick with me when it&#13;
comes to thinking of my career at the Bank is the privilege, the opportunity to use one's&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
education to serve a very noble cause day in, day out, and in an environment which is&#13;
inspiring. People from the entire world working around you and serving an ideal of&#13;
international cooperation, which has been rather diminished or derided in-in recent&#13;
years, I think it's nothing less than a privilege. And every day I came to work, except&#13;
occasionally during those last few years, I felt a sense of opportunity and--and honor to&#13;
serve at the World Bank, because I still think it's one of the most remarkable institutions&#13;
on earth, even if it isn't as healthy as it should be.&#13;
&#13;
And-and of course, how many people get to earn a good living while doing good?&#13;
[Laughter] So the combination of service to the international community and being well&#13;
rewarded for that is quite special.&#13;
&#13;
And, of course, as an opportunity to live in the United States for, in my case, 22 years,&#13;
that, too, was a privilege because it remains the cultural powerhouse of the earth. And, of&#13;
course, for a Canadian it's special because we're cousins, too, so I love this country much&#13;
more deeply as a result of having served at the World Bank, and I defend it to any critics&#13;
overseas at any opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
And finally, of course, I just learned an immense amount here, probably as much as I&#13;
would've learned at a university as a research fellow or as a professor, but in the practical&#13;
details of action rather than theory. And that, too, has been wonderful.&#13;
&#13;
I made a few friends. [Laughter] Most of them Americans, curiously enough. That, too,&#13;
has been part of it.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, I take away from this time at the Bank an energy and an ardor for promoting&#13;
international cooperation in other fields and in other ways.&#13;
&#13;
And I suppose-finally, if! were to give advice to newcomers to the Bank, it would be to&#13;
value the difference between one's own experience and that of others in the institution, to&#13;
be thrilled rather than surprised or disconcerted by a very different approach people may&#13;
take to the same problem because it's in that-it's in the convergences of talent and&#13;
experience that new things become possible.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
CALDERISI: Thank you, Bill.&#13;
