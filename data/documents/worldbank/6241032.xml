            Drawing on the World Bank's Private
            Participation in Infrastructure Project Database, this Note
            reviews developments in the water and sewerage sector of
            developing countries in 2004 and changes in private
            participation in the sector since 2001. Data for 2004 show
            that total investment in water and sewerage projects with
            private participation amounted to nearly US$2 billion.
            Recent private activity in water was concentrated in a few
            countries and focused on treatment plants and smaller projects.
