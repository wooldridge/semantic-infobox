ABSTRACT&#13;
Integrated rural development projects, instruments intended to&#13;
bring about equitable economic growth, have a number of functional components&#13;
which are operationally unrelated. Agricultural production promoting activi-&#13;
ties such as the extension of credit are combined with social components (such&#13;
as the provision of health services) and with infrastructure building works&#13;
(such as road construction or rural electrification).&#13;
Although the concept of a multipronged approach to rural develop-&#13;
ment appears sound and attractive to many, its actual application has in many&#13;
instances been disappointing. In particular, concrete achievements and hence&#13;
measurable benefits often fall short of planning goals. It is argued in this&#13;
study that the modesty in achievements experienced, so far, is due as much to&#13;
the complexity of the problem, rural underdevelopment, as it is the result of&#13;
structure and inexperience of the (mostly public sector) institutions that are&#13;
asked to implement the project designs.&#13;
Concluding that the concept of integrated rural development merits&#13;
further, albeit cautious and selective, application, the study recommends&#13;
(1) pursuing an institutionalization of project development activities in&#13;
stages, as is done de facto in, e.g., Brazil and Ecuador; (2) enlisting private&#13;
sector land development companies operating in frontierlands as executing agencies;&#13;
and (3) supporting financially and with technical assistance the many nongovern-&#13;
mental agencies that operate in rural development.&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
Los proyectos de desarrollo rural integrado, que son mecanismos&#13;
cuyo objetivo es producir un crecimiento econ6mico equitativo, tienen&#13;
diversos componentes funcionales que no estAn relacionados entre si desde&#13;
el punto de vista operacional. Las actividades de promoci6n de la produc-&#13;
ci6n agricola, como el suministro de credito, se combinan con componentes&#13;
sociales (como la prestaci6n de servicios de salud) y con obras de cons-&#13;
trucci6n de infraestructura (como la construcci6n de caminos o la electri-&#13;
ficaci6n rural).&#13;
Si bien el concepto de enfoque multiple para la soluci6n de los&#13;
problemas del desarrollo rural parece s6lido y es atractivo para muchas&#13;
personas, su aplicaci6n efectiva ha sido decepcionante en muchos casos.&#13;
En especial, la consecuci6n de logros concretos y, por lo tanto, de bene-&#13;
ficios  mensurables a menudo esta por debajo de las metas fijadas en la&#13;
planificaci6n.   Se sostiene en este estudio que los modestos  resultados&#13;
logrados hasta la fecha se deben en la misma medida a la complejidad del&#13;
problema, es decir, el subdesarrollo rural, y a la estructura e inexpe-&#13;
riencia de las instituciones (en su mayoria del sector puiblico) a las que&#13;
se solicita ejecutar los diseiios de los proyectos.&#13;
Se concluye en el estudio que el concepto de desarrollo rural&#13;
integrado es digno de una mayor aplicaci6n, aunque en forma cauta y selec-&#13;
tiva, y se recomienda lo siguiente: 1) procurar la institucionalizaci6n de&#13;
las actividades relativas a los proyectos en etapas, como se hace de&#13;
hecho, por ejemplo, en el Brasil y el Ecuador; 2) lograr que participen&#13;
como organismos de ejecuci6n empresas privadas de explotaci6n de tierras&#13;
que actuan en regiones no colonizadas, y 3) apoyar, financieramente y con&#13;
asistencia t6cnica, a los numerosos organismos no gubernamentales que rea-&#13;
lizan actividades de desarrollo rural.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CONDENSE&#13;
Les projets de d6veloppement rural integr6, qui sont cens6s&#13;
engendrer une croissance economique equitable, presentent un certain&#13;
nombre de volets entre lesquels n'existe nul lien op6rationnel. Les acti-&#13;
vites propres a encourager la production agricole, telles que la mise en&#13;
place d'institutions de credit, sont associees a des composantes a carac-&#13;
tere social, comme les services de sant6, et a des travaux d'am6nagement&#13;
du territoire, par exemple la construction routiere ou l'6lectrification&#13;
des zones rurales.&#13;
Si, en theorie, une approche pluridisciplinaire du developpement&#13;
rural parait satisfaisante, voire s6duisante, dans la pratique, son appli-&#13;
cation a souvent donne des resultats decevants. Les realisations con-&#13;
cretes, et donc les avantages mesurables, en particulier, restent fort en&#13;
deqa des objectifs fix6s au depart. On avance, dans cette 6tude, que&#13;
l'echec relatif enregistre jusqu'a present tient autant a la complexite du&#13;
probl6xme que pose le sous-d6veloppement rural, qu'a la structure et a&#13;
l'inexperience des institutions (essentiellement du secteur public) a qui&#13;
l'on a confie l'ex6cution des projets.&#13;
Concluant qu'il n'y a pas lieu de rejeter la notion de d6velop-&#13;
pement rural integre, mais qu'il faut l'appliquer avec prudence et discer-&#13;
nement, l'6tude recommande : 1) de poursuivre l'institutionalisation par&#13;
6tapes des activit6s d'6laboration des projets, comme cela se fait de facto&#13;
au Br6sil et en Equateur; 2) de faire appel a des societes d'amenagement&#13;
du territoire privees, operant dans les regions en voie de peuplement, en&#13;
tant qu'agences d'execution; et 3) de fournir un appui financier et tech-&#13;
nique aux nombreuses organisations non gouvernementales qui menent des&#13;
activit6s de developpement rural.&#13;

Preface&#13;
This Staff Working Paper deals with a topic that has been much&#13;
discussed and on which a great many theoretical articles have been written.&#13;
There is, however, a surprising paucity of empirical studies on rural&#13;
development projects in general and "integrated" projects in particular.&#13;
After hundreds of projects have been financed by governments around the world,&#13;
most supported by foreign aid, the virtual lack of studies dealing with actual&#13;
experiences and results is striking indeed.&#13;
Richard L.J. Lacroix undertook the work embodied in this Staff&#13;
Working Paper at the behest of the then Regional Vice-President for Latin&#13;
America and the Caribbean, Mr. Nicolas Ardito-Barletta. I supervised the work&#13;
from its inception to its conclusion. During the course of the research many&#13;
discussions were held with staff members of the World Bank, notably in&#13;
Operations Evaluations. The staff of the Latin America and Caribbean Region&#13;
provided extremely useful comments based on their field experience.&#13;
Readers should be aware that this is only a tentative and&#13;
preliminary foray into a subject deserving far more comprehensive treatment.&#13;
The Paper does not purport to do more than convey impressions derived from&#13;
visits to a handful of integrated rural development projects in Latin America&#13;
supplemented by a fairly comprehensive literature search. Yet it comes up&#13;
with potentially useful practical policy recommendations. In essence, then,&#13;
this is a pioneering attempt at drawing policy conclusions across countries in&#13;
the area of integrated rural development projects in Latin America.&#13;

A.   INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.         After World War II  the emphasis of public development  efforts was&#13;
on capital investment projects, in line with prevailing development theories.&#13;
The   creation  of   physical  capital,  as   engine   for  the   "big   push"&#13;
(Rosenstein-Rodan), or to bring about the "take-off stage" (Rostow), was seen&#13;
as the basis for economic growth and its attendant accumulation of wealth. It&#13;
was further supposed that the wealth, accumulated principally at the socially&#13;
and economically better off layers of society, would "trickle down" to the&#13;
poor. Although earlier attempts had been made to address the poor directly,&#13;
notably with the community development concept of the 50's; and although&#13;
doubts about the exclusive focus on capital formation had been voiced,&#13;
notably by Viner in 1953 and by Tinbergen in 1958, it was not until the early&#13;
70's that governments started to redirect their focus from the formation of&#13;
physical capital to certain aspects of the promotion of human capital. The&#13;
main reason for this shift in focus was the belief that "trickle down" did&#13;
not occur, or at least did not occur to the extent and with the speed&#13;
previously assumed. As a result, attempts to create wealth were now combined&#13;
with efforts to achieve a more equitable distribution of the development&#13;
effort.&#13;
2.         Early projects  with  a poverty  orientation, such  as  the  Puebla&#13;
rural   development  project  in   Mexico,  were   purely   equity   oriented,&#13;
concentrating on increasing production, and hence income, among poor farmers.&#13;
However, it was soon realized that equitable growth required providing social&#13;
services. In practice this meant a shift away from financing hardware towards&#13;
"new style" projects which, although still strong in financing capital&#13;
investment, also included components to satisfy "basic needs" and to supply&#13;
social services.&#13;
3.         With respect to lending to agriculture, the focus upon  poverty and&#13;
the emphasis on the development of human as well as physical capital, led to&#13;
the concept of integrated rural development projects. These projects are&#13;
concentrated efforts that bring to a specific rural area a basket of goods&#13;
and services including social and infrastructure components. This concept&#13;
had, by 1973, been developed and tested in various parts of the world, by a&#13;
number of development institutions, including the World Bank. Between 1969&#13;
and 19731)the Bank authorized an average of only 3 of these multi-sectoral&#13;
projects   yearly; constituting about  9%  of all  its  agricultural projects,&#13;
and representing less than 6% of its total lending to agriculture. During the&#13;
years from 1974 to 1979 these annual averages had risen to 9 multi-sectoral&#13;
projects,   representing  almost  12.5%  of  all   agricultural  projects  and&#13;
accounting for about 11% of all lending to agricul5ure, almost double the&#13;
average percentage of the 5 year period prior to 1974 .&#13;
4.         The shift  from  fairly well defined and definable engineering-type&#13;
projects to the far more complicated and uncertain "new style" projects, had&#13;
profound  consequences  for  the  promoting  and  implementing   institutions,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
including  for  the  World  Bank.  By  the nature  of  the  work  done,  these&#13;
institutions were mainly staffed by engineers and economists; professionals&#13;
whose operating methods and philosophy are dominated by fairly rigorous&#13;
analysis. Now, these same people were confronted with the necessity to&#13;
understand the motivations of people in alien cultures, they had to adapt&#13;
implementation of project components to the wishes of recipients of the&#13;
supposed benefits, they had to contend with personal and inter-institutional&#13;
rivalry in the member countries they worked in, they had to understand and&#13;
appreciate the risk to the beneficiaries of adopting recommendations that&#13;
often looked good only on paper. With respect to the implementation of the&#13;
projects, they had to contend with a large number of components, each dealing&#13;
with a particular economic or social aspect of the multi-task project;&#13;
components that were unrelated and whose simultaneous development created a&#13;
totally new problem of inter-agency coordination. While success or failure of&#13;
most engineering type projects is rather uncontroversial, success or failure&#13;
of a new style project, combining economic and social development goals, can&#13;
become  a   subjective  judgement,  often   related  to  moral  and  political&#13;
convictions. Not surprisingly, there is disagreement about whether certain&#13;
projects, and indeed the whole concept of integrated rural development,&#13;
should be called a success or a failure.In short, human development proved to&#13;
be vastly different and often much more frustrating than building a bridge or&#13;
an irrigation system. The shift in emphasis has thus led to much uncertainty&#13;
and discussion in the institutions involved as well as to much soul searching&#13;
and  frustration  among  their  staff.  This process  of adaptation to  a  new&#13;
development philosophy is on-going and appears far from finished.&#13;
5.         The  following report tries to make a contribution to understanding&#13;
and hence to future design of "new style", integrated, rural development&#13;
efforts in Latin America, and to the adaptation of the institutions involved&#13;
for the task they have set themselves. The degree of participation of&#13;
beneficiaries in design and implementation of integrated rural development&#13;
projects is a special line of inquiry that has been followed throughout the&#13;
report. The work is based on an extensive literature survey, complemented by&#13;
field research in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B.   RURAL DEVELOPMENT&#13;
6.          Agricultural  development generally  tries  to  raise  agricultural&#13;
production and productivity and is of a technical nature. It is similar to&#13;
other efforts to develop physical capital as a means for economic growth. The&#13;
construction of irrigation works, land clearing, the supply of agricultural&#13;
credit, the support for agricultural research and extension, etc. are all, by&#13;
themselves, technical aspects of agricultural development. Rural development,&#13;
though, by definition is oriented more toward benefitting primarily the poor.&#13;
Hence,  in  a  narrow  interpretation,  rural  development   is   agricultural&#13;
development among the poor segment of the rural population. Raising the poor&#13;
(usually small) farmer's production and productivity requires not only the&#13;
traditional efforts of agricultural development, but includes other specific&#13;
aspects related to the nature of the clientele as, for instance, the&#13;
provision of health services to increase work capacity; the provision of&#13;
education, to increase comprehension and absorbtion of new knowledge and of&#13;
extension,  to  increase   technical  skills,  etc.   This  aspect  of   rural&#13;
development, as a direct result of working with the poor, makes rural&#13;
development  synonymous   with   human  development.   Thus,  the  fundamental&#13;
distinction between pure agricultural and rural development is the emphasis&#13;
on physical capital development for the former, and human capital development&#13;
for the latter. It is this distinction that is often over looked and that has&#13;
created   much   frustration,   particularly  among   the   practitioners   of&#13;
agricultural  development.  Most  institutions,  including  the   World  Bank,&#13;
entrusted rural development, when that became a dominant part of prevailing&#13;
policies in the early 70's, to their specialists in agricultural development.&#13;
These latter were technicians, mostly agronomists, agriculturalists, and&#13;
economists who were trained and experienced in "old style" agricultural&#13;
development projects. For many, the new style rural development projects&#13;
represented nothing more than a shift in target population, i.e. towards the&#13;
poor. The concomitant fundamental change in the nature of the work done was&#13;
not always perceived.&#13;
7.         Early in  the  discussion  about  rural  development, policy makers&#13;
realized that agricultural development activity among the poorer segments of&#13;
the population was probably not sufficient and argued to include other than&#13;
purely production related components in rural development projects. For&#13;
instance, social services and infrastructure related components were proposed&#13;
on the basis of expected synergism between the different components. Further&#13;
arguments to include other than production related components were based on&#13;
equity considerations, i.e. more on moral than on economic grounds. Finally,&#13;
some project workers, familiar with the early years of the new style&#13;
projects, say that the attempt to meet "basic needs" was justified as an&#13;
effort to channel the increased income of small farmers, resulting from&#13;
productivity increases, into socially useful forms of expenditure. Without&#13;
this paternalism, it is alleged, the extra income would be largely spent on&#13;
frivolous forms of entertainment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
8.         The rest of this  chapter will deal briefly with : (1) clientele of&#13;
rural development, i.e. the small farmer; (2) the history of efforts at rural&#13;
development, and (3) the institutions involved in this particular facet of&#13;
economic development.&#13;
1.   The Small Farmer&#13;
9.         Rural  poor  are regarded  as  a  single  target  group  for  rural&#13;
development efforts, as if this group constitutes a homogeneous mass of rural&#13;
population, but poor rural societies are at least as diverse as the better&#13;
known urban societies. There are landless laborers, seasonal workers and&#13;
sharecroppers at the lower end of income distribution. There are small&#13;
farmers with production insufficient, or barely sufficient, for their own&#13;
subsistence. And there are small farmers with a marketable surplus which&#13;
contributes to total family income. Apart from groups directly linked to the&#13;
land  and  its  production  potential,  there  are  small   entrepreneurs  and&#13;
tradesmen either itinerant or located in rural towns. The primary target&#13;
population of rural development is the small farmer, and the other groups&#13;
will benefit only indirectly from most rural development projects. It is&#13;
sometimes argued that "integrated" rural development project must include all&#13;
rural poor, but in practice attention has generally been focussed on the&#13;
existing small farmer, since to help the others would usually require&#13;
sweeping social and political changes (land reform, etc.).&#13;
10.        The definition  of  a  small  farmer is  difficult, because of  the&#13;
diversity of natural endowments for agricultural production. A definition of&#13;
small farmer cannot simply be related to the area of land owned or worked on.&#13;
It cannot be related solely to the type of production obtained or even to the&#13;
absolute level of income generated. For the practical purposes of defining a&#13;
target population for rural development, the small farmer should best be&#13;
defined relative to his production and social environment. The lower limit of&#13;
small farmer should be the farming family who has sufficient resources to&#13;
produce just enough for its own subsistence. This may include production of&#13;
an occasional surplus in order to generate the cash, or to barter, for&#13;
products not produced on the family farm. Defining the upper limit of&#13;
"smallness"  is  more  difficult.  There  is  enough  diversity  among   rural&#13;
conditions to make it impossible to determine in general terms an upper limit&#13;
to the  definition of "small  farmer",  i.e.  an upper limit  to  the type  of&#13;
farmer  that  should benefit substantially  from rural  develoent  in  Latin&#13;
America.  However, following  the reasoning  of Morss, et. al.   the "largest"&#13;
small farmer can be defined relative to the "smallest" small farmer. The&#13;
largest farmers still eligible to be included would be those whose production&#13;
techniques do not differ principally from those used by the smallest farmer.&#13;
A typical example where this condition applies is much of the highland areas&#13;
under the integrated rural development programs in Colombia. In many parts of&#13;
the areas under the project, farming is very intensive using multi-cropping&#13;
systems on often very steep hill slopes, exclusively manually worked. This&#13;
applies to small as well as to larger farms in these areas. The largest&#13;
farmer included under this definition would face essentially the same risk as&#13;
the smallest farmer when adopting new techniques, inputs or crops. In other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
words,   the  willingness  and  ability   to  take  chances  with  respect  to&#13;
agricultural development should be more or less the same for the entire class&#13;
defined as "small". Finally, the largest "small" farmer   should not cultivate&#13;
significantly more land than the average farm in the area.&#13;
11.         It  is our experience that the  definition of small  farmer is more&#13;
difficult on paper than his, or her, identification is in the field. There is&#13;
a certain kinship, a certain class identification, among those farmers who&#13;
manage to subsist fairly well. This class tends to define itself and its&#13;
members.   It  automatically   excludes   the  very  poor,  who  may  work  as&#13;
sharecroppers or as seasonal workers on the small farmer's property. On the&#13;
other hand, those belonging to the small farmer's class are not considered&#13;
peers by larger land holders in the same area, i.e. by those whose holdings&#13;
are substantially larger than the average around them.&#13;
12.        The  extensive literature  on  small  farmers  offers some  extreme&#13;
positions on whether the small farmer acts economically rational or not. The&#13;
views range from seeing small farmers as fatalistic, favoring luck over&#13;
knowledge  and   as  being  subject  to  severe  community  pressures  against&#13;
innovation, to the view that the attitude of traditional producers towards&#13;
production,  and   particularly  changes  )in   production  can  be   explained&#13;
satisfactorily by  profitability  alone.    A  more  temperate view holds that&#13;
small farmers are rational, but fear innovations because of the high risks&#13;
they usually entail for a subsistence farmer. They are generally more&#13;
knowledgable than external experts about the reality of their existence.&#13;
Proponents of this view often contend that the real problem lies in the&#13;
nature of modern technology and in the institutions promoting it rather than&#13;
with the small farmer, as the new technology makes the farmer highly&#13;
vulnerable  and   dependent   on   fluctuating  markets  and  on 5institutions&#13;
controlled by non-farnmers and not accountable in case of failure.&#13;
13.         It would appear that the latter view is  the most  realistic. Small&#13;
farmers in any specific area have usually survived there for generations and&#13;
have accumulated a rather solid body of - maybe instinctive - knowledge about&#13;
the possibilities, limits and risks of cultivation in the particular region.&#13;
Living relatively close to the subsistence level, the risk of experiments for&#13;
them is very large - it can easily spell starvation if things go wrong. This&#13;
element is often overlooked when schemes are promoted which seem to involve&#13;
fairly reasonable risks compared to the expected returns. One such case, in&#13;
which risks were actually calculated is the Caqueza project in Colombia. This&#13;
project, an early integrated rural development pilot project in Cundinamarca,&#13;
initially assumed that low corn yields found in the area were due to a lack&#13;
of knowledge about modern production techniques on the part of the farmer.&#13;
However, after two years of on-farm experimental work, in which the farmers&#13;
cooperated and in which it was shown that the new techniques could more than&#13;
double their corn yields, farmers by and large still refused to adopt the new&#13;
technology. Further analysis of production data showed that the recommended&#13;
technology required tripling the traditional value of inputs, with nearly all&#13;
of this increase in the form of cash outlays at the time of field preparation&#13;
and seeding. Furthermore, project personnel calculated that the increase in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
cash cost, associated with the recommended new production technology, was not&#13;
offset by a commensurate return. Each dollar invested in the  inputs under the&#13;
new technology returned only $2.44, while each dollar of invested inputs&#13;
under the old technology, i.e. for seeds, fertilizer and pesticides returned&#13;
$3.75. Still, increased cash requirements and reduced returns for each dollar&#13;
spent appeared  to be  insufficient reason  for the almost total rejection  of&#13;
the new technology. After all, it could also be calculated that counter&#13;
balancing the diminished returns to cash were increases in land returns by&#13;
155%, increases to labor by 73% and increases in returns to total investment&#13;
by 13%. Furthermore, production per hectare increased by somewhat over 200%&#13;
and net returns rose by 253% under the new technology. On balance then the&#13;
technology offered was clearly profitable. Subsequently, a production risk&#13;
calculation showed that the risk to be incurred by the farmer in terms of&#13;
dollars per hectare was three times as high for the recommended new&#13;
technology as it was under traditional production methodology. In spite of&#13;
the substantially higher net returns of the new technology, the risk per&#13;
dollar net return was still 50% higher under the new technology than it used&#13;
to be. It was concluded that the farmer's perception of risk was an&#13;
important, and maybe the decisive factor in his decision of whether to adopt&#13;
or not to adopt the new technology.&#13;
14.        Another  factor  that  influences small farmers'  attitude  towards&#13;
changes, such as suggested new production approaches, are group and community&#13;
pressures.  Small  farmer  communities  often  face   distinct  socio-cultural&#13;
inhibitions against personal accumulation of wealth; they may be subject to&#13;
income   levelling  mechanisms   such   as   religious  and  extended   family&#13;
obligations. This can strengthen their determination to remain at the&#13;
subsistence level of the community rather than rise above it. The previously&#13;
mentioned study by Morss, et. al. suggests that such local sanctions against&#13;
innovation   or  accumulation  have  been  important  in  a  number  of  rural&#13;
development projects, as have social, including family, obligations, and&#13;
strong preference for leisure. Thus, the small farmers' willingness to adopt&#13;
recommendations for new production techniques depends not only on his&#13;
estimates of possible risks, but also on complex, subjective considerations,&#13;
resulting from the socio-cultural climate in which he lives.&#13;
15.        The small  farmer  in most Latin American countries is particularly&#13;
vulnerable  with  respect  to  marketing  his  excess  production.   Marketing&#13;
cooperatives are still rare, particularly among small farmers. Examples&#13;
abound, where either unscrupulous management or strong differences of opinion&#13;
among members led to premature abandonment of cooperatives. As a result, most&#13;
small farmers depend upon the itinerant trucker merchant ("rescatista") to&#13;
sell their marketable surplus as well as to buy production inputs and&#13;
household goods. It would be wrong to assume that the trucker merchant system&#13;
is monopolistic, high cost and inefficient. To the contrary, it is often&#13;
difficult to see how any other system could collect products for a market&#13;
from widely scattered small producers with a poor or non-existent feeder road&#13;
system and totally inadequate public transportation. It is often argued,&#13;
particularly by those who advocate low food prices for poor urban consumers&#13;
that the profit margins of intermediary traders are excessive. This is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
unlikely, because in most areas there is sufficient competition within the&#13;
system to prevent monopoly pricing. Nevertheless, better price information&#13;
system strengthen the bargaining hand of the small farmer vis-a-vis the&#13;
trucker merchant and could result in an overall decrease in profit margins of&#13;
the latter.&#13;
16.        There  is  often  a paternalistic  relationship  betwe-n the  small&#13;
farmer and the trucker merchant who buys up his occasional surplus production&#13;
and supplies him with his occasional requirements for inputs and household&#13;
goods. This paternalistic relationship works both ways. The trucker merchant&#13;
depends to a certain extent on the small farmer as a source for products to&#13;
be sold. The small farmer depends upon the trucker merchant in times of&#13;
distress, particularly as a source of credit. It is a relationship that is&#13;
similar to that between a tenant farmer or sharecropper and the land owner,&#13;
his "patron". As a matter of fact, in Brazilian rural development projects in&#13;
the northeast where the project entity, a public sector institution, had&#13;
acquired land from large land holders, this same institution was then&#13;
expected by the small farmers to assume the old paternalistic role of the&#13;
patron as part of its responsibility as a land owner.&#13;
17.        Sudden changes  in existing production and  marketing  patterns can&#13;
lead to precarious situations. A number of rural development projects,&#13;
notably  those  in  Colombia,  have  been  quite  successful   in   increasing&#13;
production of the small farmer population in their areas. However, this&#13;
created over-supply and actual inability to sell the increased production in&#13;
some instances. In most of these cases, public sector institutions engaged in&#13;
marketing functions have been unable to find outlets for the surplus&#13;
production of the small farmers of these areas.&#13;
18.        The small farmers' excess production that goes  to market is mostly&#13;
in the form of food for direct consumption. These are precisely the food&#13;
items whose prices are often controlled by governments in order to keep&#13;
inflation down and in order to appease urban constimers. This puts an added&#13;
and institutionalized burden on the marketing problem for the small farmer's&#13;
output.&#13;
19.        Finally, while agricultural  production  is emphasized  as the main&#13;
source of small farmers' income in monetary terms and in kind, the value of&#13;
their agricultural production is typically only somewhat over 50% of the&#13;
total income of the average poor rural family in Latin America. The remainder&#13;
is derived from other activities of various members of the family, such as&#13;
trade and wage labor. If an integrated rural development project results in&#13;
overall increased economic activity, the smallholder family not only benefits&#13;
directly through increased production of its own, but also indirectly through&#13;
increased income from its non-agricultural activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.   A Brief History&#13;
20.         Efforts at rural development  are not new. An  early  international&#13;
rural development exercise, and one that can be seen as the predecessor of&#13;
current programs, was community development. Its decade of growth and&#13;
prominence were the 50's, although the origin of the term can be traced to&#13;
the 30's when it was used to define community participation in municipal&#13;
planning in the United States. In 1948 the term community development was&#13;
first used officially in relation with rural development efforts, in what&#13;
latter came to be called developing countries, by the British Colonial&#13;
Office. Community development as proposed then was intended to help the&#13;
British Colonies in Africa to prepare for independence by improving the&#13;
territories' economy and by strengthening local government. Upon British&#13;
initiative a number of fairly modest national community development efforts&#13;
were launched in British territories in Africa about 1950. The first large&#13;
community development program was initiated in India in 1952 with support&#13;
from the Ford Foundation and the United States Foreign Economic Assistance&#13;
Agency. Soon thereafter the concept was accepted by a number of countries&#13;
worldwide, as well as by the United Nations system. Primarily as a result of&#13;
promotion and financial support by the United States, community development&#13;
experienced phenomenal growth in the decade of the 50's.&#13;
21.         However, the  varied experiences  which  led to the formulation  of&#13;
the concept of community development were related more to social goals&#13;
functions and to political objectives than they were to economic development.&#13;
Hence, the prevailing ideology underlying the concept and approach of&#13;
community development was biased towards social welfare and politics, with&#13;
matters of economic development and growth having secondary priority. The&#13;
strong support for the community development concept in the 50's by the&#13;
United States was rooted in the international political situation of that&#13;
era. Essentially, community development was seen by its advocates as the&#13;
free world's response to totalitarianism. A central theme in the cold war era&#13;
of the 50's was that the free world, and in particular its developing&#13;
nations, faced a double threat from international communism with military&#13;
agression, and the possibility of internal subversion through communist&#13;
inspired agrarian movements. It was then still believed that military and&#13;
economic  assistance  would  be  sufficient  to  counter  these  threats.  The&#13;
community  development  concept was seen, both by  the United  States  and the&#13;
United Nations  as a  democratic  means to  bring  about  economic, social and&#13;
political development. The  long  term  objective of community development was&#13;
to build stable, democratic nations. With this background and origin,&#13;
community development was described as organization, education and social&#13;
action in, for and by the community. It was designed to encourage self-help&#13;
efforts to raise standards of living and to create self-reliant communities&#13;
with an assured sense of social and political responsibility. The development&#13;
of infrastructure and social services and even the increase in production,&#13;
i.e. economic development, were seen as somewhat incidental to the basic&#13;
political motive of community development. Community development thus, as far&#13;
as the  developing countries  were concerned, was of alien origin, and was  to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
further objectives that, at best, were not directly related to their day to&#13;
day problems. Furthermore, it was political in an imposed way, it did not&#13;
plan for revolutionary changes in the existing political and economic order.&#13;
22.        Mostly through massive support by the United States and later  on a&#13;
somewhat more modest scale by the United Nations, the community development&#13;
movement saw some spectacular growth in the early 50's. By 1960 more than 60&#13;
nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America had initiated national community&#13;
development programs. India's much vaunted community development program&#13;
launched in 1952, gave the movement an added legitimacy. Actually, until&#13;
about the mid-50's the Indian program served as a prototype for national&#13;
programs in other Asian countries. Where national community development&#13;
efforts  were  being  implemented,  usually  a  large  new   bureaucracy   was&#13;
established to administer the program and to coordinate its components,&#13;
executed by various technical ministries and regional offices. At the field&#13;
level, the community development activities were usually initiated by posting&#13;
a specially trained civil servant, the "multi-purpose village level worker"&#13;
into a community or village. These village level workers were generally&#13;
secondary school graduates with several months of pre-service training in a&#13;
community development institute. He, or she, was supposed to guide and assist&#13;
villagers in identifying their needs, and translating those needs into action&#13;
programs. For doing that the village level worker was supposed to have skills&#13;
in a variety of subjects ranging from village organization to technical&#13;
matters of agriculture and the supply of health services. These generalists&#13;
were supposed to be assisted by specialists from central offices.&#13;
23.        There were very limited and sporadic efforts  made to recognize the&#13;
stratification  of  most   rural  communities  and  the   resultant  different&#13;
interests ranging from those of the landless laborer to those of the&#13;
commercial farmer. The village level worker often identified easiest with the&#13;
local elite and thus alienated the majority of the population. Consequently,&#13;
there was little attention given to assuring that benefits from community&#13;
development programs actually acrued to the rural poor. Realizing this, the&#13;
majority of the rural poor did not respond to the community development&#13;
approach.&#13;
24.        Compounding this problem was  the widespread  internal conflict and&#13;
animosity within the major United States agencies that supported development&#13;
and provided technical services. Conflicts, which permeated the foreign aid&#13;
agencies were essentially ideological battles pitting generalists against&#13;
specialists, social scientists against tezhnocrats. Finally, by the early&#13;
60's, these bureaucratic battles were won by the bureaucratically better&#13;
entrenched  technical  services'  personnel who were less  abstract,  and some&#13;
would say more practical, in their perceptions of economic development. As a&#13;
corollary of this, community development agencies in developing countries&#13;
were merged into long established ministries of agriculture or internal&#13;
affairs, if not totally abolished.&#13;
25.        Probably because of the nature  of the victors in this bureaucratic&#13;
battle, the criticism most often heard, in retrospect, of the community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
development movement is that its programs were inefficient in reaching&#13;
economic goals. This criticism is voiced in spite of the fact that economic&#13;
goals never had priority with the movement, since the evolution of the&#13;
community development movement went from social welfare and public works to&#13;
cooperatives, to organizing local government and finally to some technical&#13;
support for agriculture.&#13;
26.         By the early 60's a  number of large community development programs&#13;
were being discontinued, including the well known Indian program. It is fair&#13;
to say that by 1965 the community development movement had ended. The two&#13;
main reasons for the rapid decline of the movement appear to be the sharp&#13;
reduction of interest in the topic in the United States, and diminishing&#13;
financial support for it, and the realization of leaders in principal&#13;
developing countries that community development failed to achieve stated&#13;
objectives.  A  fundamental   reason  for  the  ineffectiveness  of  community&#13;
development as a concept of rural development was that it did not, and was&#13;
not   intended   to   change  the  basic  structural  barriers  to  a  general&#13;
acceleration of economic growth since it did not promote growth among the&#13;
lower levels of society. It also remained an alien movement in most&#13;
developing countries, directed and financed by foreigners.&#13;
27.         We  have described the community  development movement, its  growth&#13;
and decline in some detail because of the striking parallel between this&#13;
concept and the concept of integrated rural development, which we will&#13;
discuss in the following chapter. The era of community development was&#13;
followed, in Latin America, by a period of institutionalized agrarian reform.&#13;
Land reform, the large scale exchange of ownership of land between different&#13;
social classes, has  a long  history in Latin America.  Early attempts at land&#13;
reform were the result of severe social inequities and came about after&#13;
violent revolutionary action outside the institutional framework of the state&#13;
and society. This was generally true of revolutionary land reform movements&#13;
up to the early 60's. The land reform movements of 1917 in Mexico are&#13;
probably the best known of this era of land reform.&#13;
28.         By  the  early  60's, governments  throughout  Latin  America  felt&#13;
increasing pressure to increase production and agricultural exports in order&#13;
to meet food requirements of the growing urban populations on the one hand&#13;
and to meet foreign exchange requirements for industrial development on the&#13;
other. As a result, land reform movements were institutionalized as a means&#13;
to rationalize and improve agricultural production. This new motivation for&#13;
land reform was supported by secondary motivations such as the Cuban&#13;
Revolution, which increased the fears of extremist agrarian movements in many&#13;
countries, by a desire to stem the flow of rural poor to the cities, and by&#13;
the political pressures that originated from the Punta del Este Charter of&#13;
the Organization of American States in 1961. Based on the ideas of Raul&#13;
Prebisch the Punta del Este conference established a development policy for&#13;
agriculture based on a combination of agrarian reform and support for&#13;
technological   improvements.   In   most   Latin   American   countries   the&#13;
institutionalized  agrarian  reform  of   the  60's  was  accompa ied  by  the&#13;
formation of a number of public sector institutions, to deal with and to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
assist the newly landed farmers.&#13;
29.        Redistributive land reforms in  general have been  most  successful&#13;
if they were exercised against the remnants of feudalism. They have been less&#13;
successful if they were promoted against large land holdings which were&#13;
either under-utilized or condemned because size limits were imposed on land&#13;
ownership. The former type of land reform, directed against outdated social&#13;
structures could generally find broad political support. The latter, directed&#13;
against sometimes strong opposition of the landed elite has generally been&#13;
less successful in redistributing land from large land holders to small and&#13;
medium scale rural farmers. Land reform is often seen as a pre-condition for&#13;
effective  rural  development  since  increases  in  production  require  land&#13;
ownership by the rural poor which is assumed to be the only means to provide&#13;
a sufficient motivation to increase agricultural production.&#13;
30.        With the possible exception  of some Central American countries and&#13;
parts of Brazil, elimination of estates as a justification for agricultural&#13;
reform has been exhausted in Latin America. Thus, agrarian reform based on&#13;
transfer of land ownership that aroused little political opposition was&#13;
finished by the end of the sixties. Further agrarian reform would have&#13;
implied redistribution of land ownership away from increasingly strong&#13;
sectors of society. This did not happen, and as a result, by the early 70's&#13;
the   agrarian  reform  movements  in   most  Latin  American   countries  had&#13;
essentially come to a halt. From then on attention became focused on the&#13;
concept of integrated rural development as a means to foster economic growth&#13;
among the rural poor and a way to achieve a more equitable distribution of&#13;
the fruits of economic development.&#13;
3.   The Institutions&#13;
31.        Public  sector institutions engaged in rural development work  both&#13;
at the international and national levels are mostly staffed with planning and&#13;
evaluation personnel who are trained primarily in economic analysis. These&#13;
economic (and financial) analysts are supported by technical specialists,&#13;
mostly agronomists and agricultural subsector specialists. The distinction&#13;
between agricultural development and rural development is often unclear for&#13;
these specialists who work on both types of projects.&#13;
32.        Local  implementing  agencies often  are staffed, at least  at  the&#13;
decision making level, by persons with administrative and professional&#13;
experience in other institutions of the public sector. Because of the nature&#13;
of the work undertaken, the staff of agencies involved in rural development&#13;
tends to be from ministries of agriculture, agrarian banks, or agrarian&#13;
reform institutions. Many people at the decision making level in such Latin&#13;
American institutions have been educated in either Europe or the United&#13;
States. Functional key personnel such as those dealing with agricultural&#13;
extension, technical assistance, and agricultural credit are often only&#13;
accustomed  to  work  with   medium  and  large  scale farming.  Policies  and&#13;
operational methods of many institutions in Latin America were developed in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Europe and in the United States by similar institutions which, however, work&#13;
for a different clientele. Principles and methodologies employed there were&#13;
designed for the economic and social reality of the countries concerned. For&#13;
instance, agricultural extension, technical assistance or credit as supplied&#13;
to the highly technified and well capitalized producer of commodities in the&#13;
mid-western part of the United States are vastly different from the methods&#13;
that should be employed to supply the same goods and services to a&#13;
smallholder in Colombia operating a multi-crop production system producing&#13;
partially for his own subsistence and partially for an uncertain home market.&#13;
Thus, a problem faced by the practitioners of rural development is that&#13;
national institutions often have neither the personnel and the operational&#13;
methods for the real task at hand, nor the inclination to adapt their&#13;
methodologies to the needs of the small farmer. Local institutions often&#13;
continue to promote unsuitable technologies such as mechanized mono-cropping&#13;
systems  with   capital  intensive  use  of  inputs  developed  for  extensive&#13;
commercial agriculture, instead of trying to develop systems to enhance the&#13;
efficiency of the traditional multi-cropping systems that use a minimum of&#13;
purchased inputs and employ a maximum of family labor. Only recently and&#13;
sporadically are public sector institutions in Latin American countries&#13;
coming to realize that technical assistance and supply of credit should be&#13;
specific to the demands of the small rural farmer clientele.&#13;
33.        Hence,  it is gradually  recognized that redirection of  funds  for&#13;
development towards the rural poor in new style projects will require changes&#13;
in the evaluation and operational capacity of donor as well as national&#13;
implementing organizations. These institutions must be better geared to&#13;
respond to local needs while building local social and technical capacity.&#13;
Unfortunately, many institutions both international and national, are under&#13;
pressure not  to  effect these necessary  changes.  Most  institutions have to&#13;
meet short term goals and pressures for immediate results are very strong.&#13;
Timing and amount of funds committed for disbursement are used as internal&#13;
yardsticks to judge professional performance. Such emphasis on short term&#13;
results makes it difficult to adapt evaluation and implementation procedures&#13;
to local requirements, and often prevents the institution from moving beyond&#13;
an ad hoc relief and welfare approach to poverty. A corollary is the bias&#13;
toward   project  as   against  program   funding.  Projects  can  be  clearly&#13;
circumscribed,  they  are   by   nature   bound  to   specific  deadlines  for&#13;
implementation. They have expected start-up costs and emphasize technical&#13;
facilities  and equipment over the  development  and  funding of capacities to&#13;
sustain the operation and to maintain it after the project has disbursed its&#13;
funds. By the nature of the institutions, and the way they operate, their&#13;
professionals are not rewarded for being responsive to local conditions nor&#13;
for contributing toward the development of local institutional capacities.&#13;
Personal initiative of competent and dedicated staff of these organizations&#13;
occasionally produces efforts in that direction, but they remain fragmented&#13;
and individual and are, as yet, not institutionalized.&#13;
34.        The  emphasis  on  short  term  results, on meeting  deadlines,  on&#13;
disbursement of funds, leads to a strategic approach of institution building&#13;
that is equally short term and is often meant to serve mainly the direct&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
interests of a specific project. These interests are then equated with the&#13;
interests of the main institutions supporting the project, rather than with&#13;
the project and its beneficiaries proper. As a result, special project units&#13;
are established, using special incentives to lure personnel away from the&#13;
more permanent institutions of the public sector, undermining the latter's&#13;
potential for sustained long term action. Pressures to move large amounts of&#13;
money put emphasis on projects and project components that are capital&#13;
intensive. The administrative overhead, in terms of professional time to be&#13;
spent per dollar disbursed can thus be minimized. Effective work with the&#13;
rural poor, though, would require a much higher ratio of staff to dollars&#13;
disbursed and obtaining achievements takes much longer than experience with&#13;
capital development projects would suggest.&#13;
35.        The  large international donor  agencies, in  line  with commercial&#13;
practices, emphasize the "sales function" of their professional staff. As a&#13;
consequence, the largest portion of operational budgets go to project&#13;
identification, preparation and appraisal; to the efforts necessary to making&#13;
the  loan.  Resources  spent  on   project  supervision  and   evaluation  are&#13;
notoriously limited and are under constant pressure to be reduced even&#13;
further. This tendency is against the expressed wish of many field personnel,&#13;
who welcome the multiple and broad based experience of most staff members of&#13;
large international organizations, as well as their political neutrality in&#13;
the country concerned. They appreciate the continuity that international&#13;
agency personnel can bring to public sector institutions that have a high&#13;
turnover of personnel. But again, it is most often because of personal&#13;
initiative by dedicated and competent individual staff that the consistent&#13;
support   is  given.   This   type   of   more   intensive   effort   is   not&#13;
institutionalized, and is in effect continuously threatened to be diminished,&#13;
mainly for reasons of cost. Institution building results cannot be quantified&#13;
and easily shown as "output".&#13;
36.        There  are large numbers  of  non-governmental  agencies engaged in&#13;
one or another aspect of rural development. Often, these organizations are&#13;
based on personal initiative, drive and ambition of a charismatic leader who&#13;
is following his, or her, own vision of human development. Sometimes these&#13;
organizations are established by other agencies or institutions such as&#13;
churches, unions, and even political parties. Generally, the non-governmental&#13;
organizations are small and their impact is limited both geographically as&#13;
well  as  substantively.  For  that  reason  and  for  reasons  of  questioned&#13;
effectiveness,   non-governmental  organizations   are   often   dismissed  as&#13;
inefficient  agents  for  rural  development   by  the  larger  public  sector&#13;
institutions.  However,  given   the  immensity  of   the   problem  of  rural&#13;
underdevelopment, and the relatively limited impact that the massive effort&#13;
of international agencies and national public sector institutions so far have&#13;
achieved, it does not appear justified to omit any possible resource in&#13;
mounting efforts at integrated rural development. Many non-governmental&#13;
private agencies engaged in rural development in Latin America receive&#13;
international  support  from  large  donor   organizations  with   social  and&#13;
developmental philosophies similar to those of the particular organizations&#13;
supported.   With  respect  to   rural   development,   relief   and   welfare&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
organizations   with   religious    backgrounds   and   politically   oriented&#13;
institutions left of center, mostly from European origin, are the main&#13;
institutional supporters of private efforts at rural development in Latin&#13;
America. The type of rural development activity in which the non-governmental&#13;
organizations are engaged is more oriented toward community development and&#13;
to a mediator role between the rural poor and the services of the public&#13;
sector than is the case for most large scale rural development projects&#13;
supported by international donors and the main national public institutions.&#13;
One of the reasons for this somewhat different emphasis is the origin of many&#13;
of the non-governmental agencies, in relief and welfare work, before their&#13;
relatively recent reorientation towards productive efforts as a basis for&#13;
rural   development.   Thus,   although  both   public  and   non-governmental&#13;
institutions see rural development as a combination of production related&#13;
activity and relief, the public sector institutions, today, tend to emphasize&#13;
agricultural production while this emphasis only begins to emerge among the&#13;
non-governmental institutions.&#13;

C.   INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT&#13;
37.        The discussion of rural  development contained in this  chapter  is&#13;
sub-divided into two parts : the first deals with the concept and major&#13;
issues, the second with observing integrated rural development projects and&#13;
interviewing both project personnel and client6le in Brazil, Colombia,&#13;
Ecuador and Mexico. The synthesis at the end of this chapter leads to the&#13;
suggestions made subsequently in the last chapter of the report.&#13;
1.   The Concept&#13;
38.        The  concept of integrated rural development  is  often  considered&#13;
vague, particularly in academic literature, either because the philosophy is&#13;
considered unclear, or because the concept is considered too confused to&#13;
serve as a practical strategic tool. Field experience shows, however, that&#13;
the practical application of the concept is less vague than it is often&#13;
considered to be. Most practitioners use the term "integrated" as describing&#13;
the fact that this type of rural development projects tries to integrate a&#13;
number of otherwise unrelated components, each of them addressing one aspect&#13;
of rural underdevelopment. It is generally agreed that the various components&#13;
of the projects can be sub-divided into three main categories : components&#13;
related to agricultural production, components related to social services,&#13;
and infrastructural components. Among the first category, those directly&#13;
related to agricultural production are agricultural credit, extension and&#13;
technical assistance, input supply, and marketing assistance. The most&#13;
frequent social components are education and health. Among infrastructure&#13;
components,   road  construction  tends  to   predominate,  followed  by   the&#13;
construction of potable water supply systems, irrigation works and rural&#13;
electrification.&#13;
39.        By  definition  then,  integrated  rural  development  projects are&#13;
those that try to bring a basket of goods and services, consisting of&#13;
production, social  and infrastructure components  to  poor  rural  areas. Not&#13;
only the operational implications of the concept appear to be fairly clear to&#13;
its field practitioners, but the reasons for integrating a number of&#13;
otherwise  unrelated  components  appear   to   be  agreed  upon.  Often,  the&#13;
justifications advanced for including social components are based on moral&#13;
convictions, i.e. that the rural poor have an innate right to social benefits&#13;
such as health and education, partly because they are supposed to be&#13;
available to poor urban dwellers. For other practitioners the inclusion of&#13;
social components in rural development projects is justified if these&#13;
components contribute to the effectiveness of production related components,&#13;
as e.g. when a healthier farmer is able to work harder and hence produce&#13;
more, or when a better educated farmer is able to absorb more fully the&#13;
benefits of new technology. Finally, there are those who do not see a&#13;
justification for the complexity entailed in combining a number of unrelated&#13;
components into one project. Mostly this view can be found among the&#13;
traditional practitioners of agricultural development, i.e. among those who&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
do not distinguish between rural and agricultural development.&#13;
40.        The most temperate  view  of  integrated  rural development,  and a&#13;
consensus that can be reached with most practitioners is based upon seeing&#13;
components as complementary to the basic objective of a project. It is&#13;
generally agreed that the basic objective of rural development projects is to&#13;
bring about an increase in production and productivity of the small farmer&#13;
rather than welfare. It can then further be agreed that other components be&#13;
brought into integrated rural development projects only if and when needed to&#13;
support the major objective. But often project design simply follows a&#13;
blueprint  approach.  Overzealous   project  designers  include   the  largest&#13;
possible number of components, and their implementation is fixed with time&#13;
frames and deadlines, based on scant information about realities in the&#13;
project area. Typically, agricultural credit and technical assistance are&#13;
found as production components; health and education as social components;&#13;
and road construction as an infrastructure component. Projects designed with&#13;
such a standard set of components, coupled with rigid implementation and&#13;
disbursement   schedules,   lack   the  flexibility   necessary  to  fit   the&#13;
complementary components to the local situation.&#13;
41.         However, the less  rigid  and  least bureaucratic  of international&#13;
organizations allow project design and implementation timing to be adjusted&#13;
during the  life  of the project, based on its particular requirements.  As  a&#13;
matter of fact, the majority of projects require such adjustments in their&#13;
original design. Many projects are extended beyond the usual five year&#13;
implementation period. These actions are usually taken to adapt the reality&#13;
of project implementation to project design, i.e. to increase complementarity&#13;
between components to reach an optimum combination of project activities.&#13;
42.        Most  integrated  rural   development  projects  rely  on  existing&#13;
sectoral agencies of the public sector to implement the various project&#13;
components. The ministry of agriculture will be responsible for technical&#13;
assistance and extension, the ministry of health for the health component,&#13;
public works i'or road construction, etc. Usually, there is a project&#13;
directorate responsible for day to day management of the project and,&#13;
particularly, for the coordination between the various sectoral agencies.&#13;
Difficulties associated with these coordination activities have become the&#13;
best known, and most widely commented on management problem of integrated&#13;
rural development projects.&#13;
2.   Issues&#13;
43.        The following are  the major  issues identified in discussions with&#13;
project  personnel,  with   beneficiaries  and  with  other  practitioners  of&#13;
integrated rural development. They are either related to the projects proper&#13;
or to the institutions that promote or implement the individual projects.&#13;
44.         a.     IRD, Does It Work? - The  answer to this loaded  question is&#13;
a qualified yes. Integrated rural development appears to work but often not&#13;
exactly  as  it  was  intended   to,  particularly  in  the  early   years  of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
implementation. It does not produce quick results. Underperformance with&#13;
respect to meeting deadlines, pace of disbursement of funds, and problems&#13;
with project management have led to many frustrations for those responsible&#13;
for project design and supervision. Much of this frustration is related to&#13;
both the ing5itutions promoting the projects and the concept of the projects&#13;
themselves.&#13;
45.        The  complexity   and  the  required  technical  sophistication  of&#13;
project design effectively exclude the target population from participation&#13;
in project formulation. Thus, technocratic outsiders are making decisions&#13;
about problems and their solutions. The resulting project is usually in line&#13;
with prevailing national policies and project objectives are couched in terms&#13;
of   national  development  and  production  goals,  contributions  to  export&#13;
potential and the like. The requirement of bankability leads to stereotyped&#13;
project formulation, anticipating what financing institutions want to see, by&#13;
personnel trained in standard evaluation procedures by the same banking&#13;
institution. This procedure atrophies the effort of project evaluation as&#13;
well as the generation of creative ideas and unusual solutions. On the&#13;
contrary, preparation/appraisal reports tend to become rigid implementation&#13;
manuals.&#13;
46.        The  dichotomy  between   project   design   and  the   reality  of&#13;
implementation is quite obvious in most projects. Uncertainties, absence of&#13;
real knowledge about the area targeted, and the inexperience of the project&#13;
personnel almost invariably lead to an initial period of a few years when&#13;
tangible achievements are minimal. In those projects that ultimately can be&#13;
considered successful, this initial period is used, in essence, by well&#13;
motivated and dedicated project personnel as the real project preparation&#13;
stage, in the sense that during this initial stage of project formulation,&#13;
decisions can be made about what can and should be done in terms of project&#13;
components in the particular area. This initial period is used to establish a&#13;
rapport between the project personnel and the intended beneficiaries, which&#13;
may lead to a certain level of beneficiary participation.&#13;
47.        The  fact   that  time   tables,   deadlines   and   implementation&#13;
expectations are often unrealistic, is recognized by some of the larger donor&#13;
organizations whose supervisory personnel shows flexibility and willingness&#13;
to adapt the project's planning to the realities of implementation. Funds are&#13;
shifted between components, deadlines for certain components are extended,&#13;
the inability to implement certain components is accepted, and often,&#13;
projects are extended beyond the usual five year implementation period.&#13;
However, there is a gap between these lessons from the field and project&#13;
evaluation  and   approval  procedures.   There  is  a   certain   inertia  in&#13;
institutions to adapt themselves to the operational requirements of a new&#13;
concept. As a result, influential members of the institutions blame the&#13;
concept of integrated rural development for many of the frustrations that&#13;
actually originate in their own institution's slowness of adaptation.&#13;
48.        b.      Beneficiary Participation - The  clientele  of an integrated&#13;
rural development project participates not only in the project's benefits but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
also in some decisions about and within the project. In the early stages of a&#13;
project, however, there is usually little or no dialogue between project&#13;
personnel and the intended beneficiaries. Project personnel, new to the area,&#13;
know neither the social structure nor the politics of the society it has to&#13;
deal with. The inhabitants of the area tend to regard these new arrivals in&#13;
the light of their previous experience with public sector personnel, i.e. the&#13;
police, the tax collector, and, in some countries, a local politician. Under&#13;
such conditions meaningful beneficiary participation in project evaluation&#13;
and  design  is  difficult  to  establish.  A   second  reason  why  extensive&#13;
representative participation does not take place is related to the structure&#13;
of rural society. Rural society is stratified with very poor layers such as&#13;
laborers or sharecroppers, intermediate layers such as small land owners and&#13;
tradesmen, and elites, such as large land owners or village notables. It is&#13;
unrealistic to expect within a rural project sudden democratic decision&#13;
making by a heterogeneous population which normally does not do that.&#13;
Finally, universal representative beneficiary participation conflict with the&#13;
motivations of the bureaucracy of some donor agencies. Committing money for&#13;
disbursement is the key to their career and full participation by project&#13;
beneficiaries would typically imply that the project would be implemented at&#13;
the people's pace and scale, because project personnel would have to struggle&#13;
with the population's learning processes. As a result, project design would&#13;
have to be more conservative, project implementation schedules would have to&#13;
be lengthened and discounted cost benefit analysis would come out much less&#13;
favorable than if stricter controls of a project are assumed.&#13;
49.         Basically,  integrated  rural  development   projects  are  service&#13;
delivery efforts, and beneficiary participation normally is limited to&#13;
decisions about how to do things and to sharing in the benefits of the&#13;
project. Decisions about what to do are mostly made by project staff, who are&#13;
responsible for the money spent. This separation of responsibility between&#13;
the project personnel who decide essentially about what to do, and the&#13;
beneficiaries who participate in how to do it is not really an unrealistic or&#13;
unfair separation of responsibilities. After all, in most deprived rural&#13;
areas it is quite easy to see what can be done: in essence anything that&#13;
would contribute to economic and social well being of the population and to&#13;
an equitable distribution of the fruits of development. Usually, a number of&#13;
ideas and pet projects have been around for a long time. Thus, drawing up a&#13;
list of actions that could be taken is easy. The problem is to establish&#13;
priorities, given the financial constraints faced by the project. Project&#13;
personnel, not directly involved with political considerations in the area&#13;
can by and large be considered better placed to decide on political and&#13;
economic trade-offs. But participation by the population in how to do things&#13;
is important for two reasons. First, it will bring to the project the&#13;
particular expertise and knowledge of the rural population with respect to&#13;
general conditions and natural phenomena in the area. Second, decisions about&#13;
how to implement certain project components may generate enough popular&#13;
interest and a sense of participation to induce long term involvement&#13;
necessary for the maintenance of works and for the continuation of progress&#13;
achieved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
50.         c.   Coordination of Project Components -    Problems   with    the&#13;
coordination of activities of the various sectoral agencies participating in&#13;
a project have plagued almost all integrated rural development projects. When&#13;
discussing coordination problems, reference is mostly made to horizontal&#13;
coordination, i.e. integration of usually independent services in order to&#13;
secure a unity of purpose and joint action. Management problems arise because&#13;
separate budgets are involved and bureaucratic power struggles arise as the&#13;
various institutions mobilize their political backers i3 win jurisdictional&#13;
and legal arguments. As Judith  Tendler has  pointed out   these  institutions&#13;
act rationally from their perspective. Tendler distinguishes between strong&#13;
and weak institutions in general, and with respect to rural development in&#13;
particular. Strong institutions are those that generate revenue or have&#13;
strong   supporters  lobbying  for  their   interests,  such  as  construction&#13;
companies who support the interests of public sector institutions responsible&#13;
for rural road construction. Strong institutions also can often garner a&#13;
strong political constituency in the form of influencial elites in the area.&#13;
Weaker institutions on the other hand are those that do not have their own&#13;
revenue  base,   strong   supporters   or  strong  constituents.  Institutions&#13;
supplying rural health and education are typically weaker than institutions&#13;
supplying production related services, such as the ministry of agriculture or&#13;
the agricultural bank. Strong agencies will want to play a central role in&#13;
the project, and will often have enough political backing to obtain that&#13;
role.  Weaker   agencies,  perceiving  their  subordination  to  the  stronger&#13;
institutions, will be disinclined to participate in the project. They will&#13;
prefer to concentrate their effort on activities that are completely within&#13;
their control. This has been typically the case with the health components in&#13;
integrated rural development projects.&#13;
51.        Problems  of  vertical   coordination,   i.e.  intra-organizational&#13;
integration and problems of integration of a project with national policies&#13;
are much less frequently discussed. Integrated rural development can of&#13;
course be more successfully implemented the fewer the coordination problems&#13;
and the stronger the national commitment to this type of development effort.&#13;
Project implementation will be facilitated when national development policies&#13;
articulate the necessity to coordinate efforts, including a requirement for&#13;
the various institutions to collaborate in the effort. Also, projects will&#13;
run more smoothly when there is an appropriate organization within ministries&#13;
to support integrated rural development at the field level.&#13;
52.         The  history of integrated rural development in Colombia provides a&#13;
good example of the importance of top level commitment to a rural development&#13;
policy. The Colombian integrated rural development program started with&#13;
modest pilot scale projects in the early 70's. By 1975, the results of these&#13;
pilot projects had become sufficiently known and appreciated for the newly&#13;
elected President Lopez Michelsen to give it his strong personal backing. At&#13;
that point, the concept of integrated rural development was made part of&#13;
national development policy; major international organizations, the World&#13;
Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and AID were invited to cooperate,&#13;
while the president extended substantial personal efforts to develop a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
nation-wide program. Recognizing the potential problems of coordination&#13;
between the various agencies that were supposed to cooperate in this national&#13;
effort, Lopez Michelsen personally secured their collaboration.&#13;
53.        Three  factors should be kept in mind in designing and implementing&#13;
integrated rural development projects. First, the more a project is perceived&#13;
as being strictly local, the less opposition it will create at the national&#13;
headquarters   level   of    major   institutions.   This    factor   suggests&#13;
decentralization of programs, i.e. the transfer of certain powers and&#13;
functions to local authorities and the selection of projects for fairly small&#13;
areas. Second, coordination of efforts between personnel of sectorally&#13;
different institutions  is usually better at  the  operational  level  in  the&#13;
field. Inevitably, personnel of such institutions working in the same&#13;
geographic area will be in frequent contact with each other. Unless there are&#13;
strong   personal  dislikes,  this  personnel  will  discuss  common  problems&#13;
encountered in their respective work and find ways to accommodate each other.&#13;
Higher echelons in the institutional bureaucracy will increasingly have&#13;
other, and often conflicting interests and coordination efforts will be&#13;
influenced more by unrelated issues. Third, the role of overall coordinator,&#13;
and sometimes mediator, is best played by an institution which does not have&#13;
a direct functional responsibility. A staff type agency, such as a national&#13;
planning office or a development ministry are better equipped to perform the&#13;
coordinating role than, for instance, the ministry of agriculture or a&#13;
ministry of public works. A staff type agency is particularly appropriate if&#13;
it has budgetary responsibilities, such as national planning offices often&#13;
have.  The  power  of  the  purse  is  a  very  strong  motivator   to  enlist&#13;
collaboration.&#13;
54.        The attempt to solve the coordination problem by creating  entirely&#13;
new autonomous implementation units has not been very successful. The idea to&#13;
create a new unit for project implementation was the logical consequence of&#13;
the frustration of early project designers and supervisors. Their experience&#13;
lead  them  to   regard  existing  institutions  as  inefficient,  technically&#13;
incompetent, understaffed and philosophically conservative with respect to&#13;
the ideas behind the new rural projects. Thus, they saw clear administrative&#13;
advantages in establishing a brand new unit. This was particularly so if they&#13;
could find like-minded local professionals to manage and staff such a unit.&#13;
However, experience has shown that these new administrative units operate&#13;
only as long as they have the financial and administrative backing from the&#13;
international agency, through the project under their responsibility. Almost&#13;
nowhere have these new administrative units been able to survice in the local&#13;
political and bureaucratic establishment. As a result, these project units&#13;
were disbanded after the project was completed, or when disbursements&#13;
stopped.&#13;
55.        The best place for  the coordination  unit  is  in  an independent,&#13;
existing, government agency at the highest possible level. Colombia has done&#13;
that from the inception of its nation-wide program for integrated rural&#13;
development, by  pla ng the directorate for this development in  the national&#13;
planning department . Ecuador has recently established a "super" ministry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
responsible for all of the country's 17 integrated rural development projects&#13;
in its current five year development plan in order to have a non-sectoral&#13;
agency responsible for coordination of its integrated rural development&#13;
program. However, the disadvantage of this new ministry is its newness; it is&#13;
not part of the bureaucratic establishment of the country, and does not have&#13;
any particular clout, other than that resulting from the channeling of&#13;
finances for the various projects.&#13;
56.         d.     Impact and Clientele - Integrated   rural   development   is&#13;
targeted on a clientele called "rural poor", which is very ill-defined. The&#13;
lack of definition of "rural poor" has been exacerbated by the need to focus&#13;
projects on farmers who have a production potential, because integrated rural&#13;
development is supposed to be development, and not welfare. Thus, many&#13;
analysts failed to recognize the complexity of the structure of rural&#13;
society, the target clientele. Subsequently, and as a corollary, they often&#13;
fail  to  recognize  that  only a  fraction  of the population  has production&#13;
potential,  in  the  sense  desired for integrated rural development projects.&#13;
The twin  results of a vague definition of the client have been a very limited&#13;
impact of integrated rural development projects, as compared with the efforts&#13;
extended, and a bias with respect to benefits extended, i.e. towards farmers&#13;
with highest production potential. By definition, the latter tend to be those&#13;
who were somewhat better off from the beginning. For instance, national&#13;
Brazilian statistics indicate that the country's entire POLONORDESTE program,&#13;
the major development program in the Northeastern part of Brazil, has reached&#13;
not more t ,n approximately 100,000 poor rural families directly in  more than&#13;
10  years.    The   same  source  estimates  that  the  area  covered  by  the&#13;
POLONORDESTE  program  contains   approximately   three   million  rural  poor&#13;
families.  Consequently, the  direct  program reached  approximately 3% of the&#13;
rural poor. Even if one assumes that there is a multiple of indirect&#13;
beneficiaries, total coverage is modest.&#13;
57.         Focusing  exclusively  on  those  who  have a  production potential&#13;
excludes  landless laborers,  and  in effect, most sharecroppers. Although the&#13;
latter are often included as potential beneficiaries of agricultural credit&#13;
under integrated rural development projects, societal and institutional&#13;
constraints  may  prevent  their   participation.  For  instance,  under   the&#13;
Colombian   Integrated   Rural   Development   Program,    sharecroppers   are&#13;
specifically included as potential beneficiaries of agricultural credit.&#13;
However, the program's administrator, the agricultural bank, requires a land&#13;
lease document as proof of a sharecropper's production intentions. In the&#13;
period of agrarian reform, in the 60's, such land lease documents were often&#13;
used by sharecroppers to claim title to the land worked on. As a result,&#13;
written proof of sharecropping contracts to-day is extremely difficult to&#13;
obtain from a Colombian land owner. Consequently, most sharecroppers are&#13;
excluded from agricultural credit, one of the main benefits under the&#13;
integrated rural development project. Since other benefits such as home&#13;
improvement loans and loans to extend rural electrification to a property,&#13;
are tied to production credit, sharecroppers under the Colombian program are&#13;
effectively excluded from the direct benefits of the entire program. In&#13;
Mexico, more than 60% of agricultural labor is landless; in Colombia about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
40% of agricultrual labor is landless. These portions of the rural poor&#13;
remain excluded from the direct benefits of integrated rural development&#13;
projects, since they have no production potential, although they benefit&#13;
indirectly from such components as health, education, construction of rural&#13;
roads, and from secondary effects such as an increased demand for labor,&#13;
coupled with higher wages. Also, a sharecropper who works under an agreement&#13;
to obtain 50% of production, will see his share increase in line with total&#13;
production increases brought about by the project. As a matter of fact, the&#13;
indirect benefits of integrated rural development projects for those at the&#13;
lower levels of the rural society provide a strong argument to include social&#13;
and infrastructural components in rural development projects. It is precisely&#13;
these components that benefit the poorest of that society.&#13;
58.        e.      Size of Project Area - Many   integrated  rural  development&#13;
projects  are   large,   covering  vast,  varied,   and  heterogeneous  areas.&#13;
Population, both in type and density, as well as agricultural and other&#13;
activities can vary considerably from one area of the project to the next.&#13;
Field experience suggests that it is more effective to limit a project to a&#13;
general farming district that is homogeneous as far as its type of population&#13;
and agricultural production potential is concerned, i.e., project boundaries&#13;
should  be  based  on  ecological  or  economic  conditions   rather  than  on&#13;
administrative divisions. In functionally or socially homogeneous areas,&#13;
problems tend to be similar in the entire area, and the same number and type&#13;
of components can be brought to bear in an integrated rural development&#13;
effort. In fact, many nationwide projects tend to get divided into area&#13;
specific sub-projects over time. The Colombian integrated rural development&#13;
program distinguishes internally between, for instance, the project parts in&#13;
Cundinamarca or in Antioquia. Actually, there is so little interchange&#13;
between the various sub-projects under the nationwide program that they&#13;
function as individual and independent projects.&#13;
59.        f.      Monitoring aygEvaluation - Following   definitions   in   a&#13;
recent World  Bank publication    monitoring is here defined as  the provision&#13;
and   use  of   information  to   enable  management  to  assess  progress  of&#13;
implementation and to take timely decisions to make sure that progress is&#13;
maintained according to schedule. Evaluation is defined as the process that&#13;
draws on the same data, generated by the monitoring system, to help explain&#13;
trends, effects and impact of the project.&#13;
60.        Monitoring,  evaluation and  interchange  of ideas between projects&#13;
are generally weak in Latin American integrated rural development projects.&#13;
There are surprisingly few publications relating objectively the experiences&#13;
of integrated rural development. And even those publications that are&#13;
available, repeatedly mention that cost figures, production data and other&#13;
quantitative information are not available. This leads to the conclusion not&#13;
only that monitoring and evaluation are not reported, but that there is also&#13;
a lack of systematic documentation, collection of data, etc.&#13;
61.        It is  not surprising  that  evaluation and monitoring are not done&#13;
systematically, since they are highly political and may affect future funding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
and employment prospects of personnel engaged in these activities as well as&#13;
of those being monitored and evaluated. More generally, there is no tradition&#13;
in Latin American societies of objective reporting that could underpin&#13;
systematic   monitoring  and  evaluation.  Evaluation  is  more  of  a  public&#13;
relations effort than an information gathering exercise. As a result, little&#13;
is known about the objective successes and failures of projects and little&#13;
agreement can be reached in this respect with regard to specific projects.&#13;
What some call successes, others will call failures, both opinions based on&#13;
subjective and intuitive interpretations of actual or imagined events. Human&#13;
development efforts such as rural development are particularly prone to such&#13;
confusions about what constitutes success or failure since many intangible&#13;
benefits   and  costs  can  be  counted  and  interpreted  quite  differently,&#13;
following personal, subjective viewpoints.&#13;
3.   Field Experiences&#13;
62.        The following sections  relate field experience  in four countries,&#13;
highlighting different approaches to defining and implementing integrated&#13;
rural development projects. These observations are based on visits which&#13;
focussed on discussions with both clients/beneficiaries and by interviews of&#13;
institutional staff, politicians, etc. both at the local and national&#13;
(capital city) level.&#13;
a.    Brazil&#13;
63.        Integrated rural development projects can  be  found  in  different&#13;
parts of Brazil; in the northeast, in the state of Minas Gerais, in the&#13;
frontier areas of the northwest and in the state of Parand. The best known&#13;
and still largest program of integrated rural development projects is located&#13;
in the Northeastern part of the country, called POLONORDESTE. As of the&#13;
middle of 1982, the POLONORDESTE program comprised 43 different integrated&#13;
rural development projects covering a geographical area corresponding to&#13;
slightly more than half of the northeastern part of Brazil and concentrating&#13;
a variety of investments and services in geographic areas that are selected&#13;
largely on the basis of their agricultural potential.&#13;
64.        An overriding impression of  the Brazilian experience is that it is&#13;
not a program at all. Rather, Brazil has a large number of projects that are&#13;
unrelated, without systematic communication or exchange of experience beween&#13;
them. There are several reasons for this fragmented development. First, the&#13;
Brazilian integrated rural development projects are identified, organized,&#13;
and actually implementÂ¶I) by the states. Although the development agency of&#13;
the Northeast,  SUDENE   , is  supposed to play a coordinating role, in effect&#13;
that role is very limited. The second reason is related to the origin and&#13;
method  of  financing.  Project  funds,  particularly  for   the  Northeastern&#13;
projects depend on yearly central government budgets. Experience over the&#13;
last 10 years has shown that such funding varies substantially from year to&#13;
year, while the way in which it is made available to the operational level is&#13;
rather complicated. In the Northeast, for instance, resources for production&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
related components are channeled through the Ministry of Agriculture, which&#13;
makes  them  available  to   its  Delegates  in  each  state.  The  extent  of&#13;
cooperation by the Delegates of the Ministry of Agriculture in the integrated&#13;
rural development projects in their state depends entirely upon the goodwill&#13;
of the Delegate proper. Resources for social components are channeled through&#13;
the Ministry of the Interior. This ministry, in turn, makes the funds&#13;
available to the finance secretariat of the state in question, which then&#13;
turns funds over to the particular project. The project directorate is&#13;
responsible for administrating the funds for the various components under the&#13;
project.&#13;
65.         Administrative  units  established specifically for  the  operation&#13;
and management of projects often have no legal status and their personnel is&#13;
delegated to them from a variety of other institutions in the public sector.&#13;
Administrative procedures are cumbersome and dedication of such personnel to&#13;
work in the integrated rural development project is sometimes questionable.&#13;
For instance, the funds for the payroll of one of the largest and oldest&#13;
project management units, in the state of Bahia, have to be distributed to&#13;
the various institutions from which its personnel originates, which use these&#13;
funds to pay the salaries. As a result, there is much confusion, delays in&#13;
payment  and   dissatisfaction  among   the   personnel.   The  administrative&#13;
establishment of the individual states tends to ignore the projects when they&#13;
are not directly involved and funding comes from Brasilia. As a result, state&#13;
funds that otherwise would have gone into areas where integrated rural&#13;
development projects  are  operating, often go  to other areas  in the  state.&#13;
Moreover, once disbursement stops, projects tend to peter out.&#13;
66.        However, there  are  exceptions, as  in the state of  Minas Gerais.&#13;
That state deals directly with international organizations, such as the World&#13;
Bank,  and funds major parts of its integrated rural development programs from&#13;
state resources. As one practitioner observed: "in the Northeast you deal&#13;
with projects in poor areas in poor states, in Minas Gerais you deal with&#13;
projects  in poor areas in a  rich  state." Differences between management and&#13;
administration of projects in the Northeast and in Minas Gerais are in&#13;
consequence quite large and fundamental. In Minas Gerais there is a much&#13;
stronger   commitment   among   the   local   political   and   administrative&#13;
establishment with respect to integrated rural development. As a matter of&#13;
fact, in the 1982 elections for governors, all three  candidates  in the state&#13;
of Minas Gerais  pledged  their support for  the integrated  rural development&#13;
programs of the state. There are also differences at the operational level&#13;
between the projects in Minas  Gerais and  in the Northeast,  differences that&#13;
may relate  to the  different  administrative structures  as  well as  to  the&#13;
conditions  in  the  areas.  By  and large, the personnel of projects  in  the&#13;
Northeast would like to see the projects have fewer components, in order to&#13;
be less complicated to implement. In Minas Gerais, on the other hand, the&#13;
higher echelons of the integrated rural development program administration&#13;
would like to increase the number of components available for any one&#13;
project. Personnel in Minas Gerais appears to be gravitating to a notion of a&#13;
state-wide program to support a large number of small, area-specific,&#13;
integrated rural development projects. The overall program should have a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
maximum number of potential components available to serve the specific needs&#13;
of any particular project.&#13;
67.        An  occasional  complaint is that  project areas are chosen  mainly&#13;
for political reasons, rather than for developmental potential, and if the&#13;
developmental potential is considered, it is judged more on technical&#13;
grounds, i.e. with respect to agricultural production potential, than it is&#13;
on social  grounds. These criticisms reflect the problems  of an approach that&#13;
seeks to combine economic and social objectives. A more frequent complaint&#13;
comes from project personnel  in a number of states: that the projects are too&#13;
large, and hence too heterogeneous with respect to population, physical&#13;
structure, land holding, climate, and agricultural production. They would&#13;
like to see smaller projects, but have not yet arrived at the notion of a&#13;
programatic  approach  supporting   a  number  of   smaller,   area   defined,&#13;
sub-projects.&#13;
68.        In spite  of  the political,  administrative and budgetary problems&#13;
the actual development of many projects in Brazil is impressive. A main&#13;
reason is the dedication of personnel in charge of field operations. Mostly,&#13;
these are young graduates from local colleges, socially conscious men and&#13;
women who have found a constructive way to vent frustrations with their&#13;
society and yet make a contribution to it. These young people realize at the&#13;
start that they do not know very much about the task at hand or about the&#13;
people they are supposed to work with. So they go out and try to learn.&#13;
Generally, teams of up to 10 project workers will spend at least a month&#13;
living and working among the target population, collecting sociological&#13;
information and beginning to build a bridge between themselves and the rural&#13;
families. The information gathered during these initial exercises is used to&#13;
gain a sociological insight into the area they deal with and, particularly,&#13;
to identify possible associations or groups that either have a natural&#13;
cohesion or that could be formed.&#13;
69.        However, what these young  project workers  have in enthusiasm  and&#13;
dedication, they often lack in practical experience. This is particularly&#13;
noticeable in such components as, for instance, extension and technical&#13;
assistance to agriculture. Given their natural inclination, and sometimes&#13;
their educational background in the social sciences, they emphasize community&#13;
development. This lead to organization and increased social awareness among&#13;
the  target  populations  and  also  to   a  certain  measure  of  beneficiary&#13;
participation. As such, this type of project personnel and the way they&#13;
operate are  quite  appropriate  and  beneficial  for the  first  phase  of an&#13;
integrated  rural  development  project,  i.e.  the   phase  of  learning  and&#13;
developing a rapport between the project personnel and the target population.&#13;
However, the subsequent phases of tangible production achievements tend to be&#13;
rather weak. As a matter of fact, project personnel complain about the&#13;
complexity of having too many components to be integrated in these projects&#13;
and, what they call "extension work" tends to relate more to social,&#13;
community development than to agricultural production. Furthermore, this&#13;
emphasis on the societal aspects of development leads to a neglect of other,&#13;
somewhat more remote and technical aspects such as the introduction of more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
appropriate technologies, construction of bio-gas plants, the use of solar&#13;
energy, simple post harvest processing techniques to reduce spoilage, or&#13;
aspects of storage and marketing. Project personnel often appears to be&#13;
ignorant about technical aspects of rural life, particularly about those that&#13;
are not usually found in their immediate surroundings. Hence, the lack of&#13;
tangible,   physical  achievements   in  those   projects  may   well   become&#13;
increasingly frustrating, unless efforts are made to upgrade the technical&#13;
capabilities of project implementation personnel.&#13;
70.        Recurring   operational  problems  are   related  to  the   erratic&#13;
availability of agricultural credit, which reflects the financial budgetary&#13;
problems mentioned above. Availability of credit is most often cited by the&#13;
small farmer himself as the major benefit accruing from the integrated rural&#13;
development project. Thus, it is most detrimental for overall project success&#13;
that credit availability at, for instance, the Bank of Brazil's local office&#13;
is unpredictable and haphazard. A variety of reasons are usually given for&#13;
the frequent lack of funds, depending on who one talks to. Some blame local&#13;
branch managers of the banks as not being sympathetic to the project, or to&#13;
the plight of the small farmer. Others contend that central authorities have&#13;
not made funds available to the local level for onlending to small farmers,&#13;
etc. Both observations probably apply to the situation, although to a degree&#13;
varying from region to region.&#13;
71.        Other  problems arise fairly  often  from land  tenure arrangements&#13;
and  marketing   bottlenecks.  Since  secure  land  ownership  is  the   major&#13;
precondition for obtaining credit from commercial sources, the sometimes&#13;
vague tenure/ownership arrangements in rural areas have created problems when&#13;
ownership was not "regularized", i.e. when farmers either did not have a&#13;
written title to their land or, if they had a title it was not registered.&#13;
Therefore, several projects (Rio Grande Do Norte, Parana) have separate "land&#13;
titling regulations" components. With regard to marketing,  efforts to improve&#13;
the situation for small farmers in project areas have been ineffective,&#13;
mainly because marketing was left to public sector institutions which are not&#13;
well  equipped to perform such functions,  especially  if they are established&#13;
in competition with, or even to replace, traditional middlemen. Bureaucratic&#13;
procedures are not easily adapted to dealing in mostly perishable goods which&#13;
have to be bought, transported and sold in a short time and at a profit.&#13;
72.        Finally,  there  are  a  number  of  private  projects  that  merit&#13;
attention. The largest and oldest private rural development project in Brazil&#13;
is a 60 year old project in the Northern part of the state of Parana. It has&#13;
developed over 1.3 million hectares of virgin land, founded 6 major cities&#13;
and 57 minor ones, sold approximately 50,000 farm properties, with an average&#13;
size of about 30 hectares, ranging from 12 to 73 hectares to small farmers,&#13;
and sold over 75,000 urban residential plots. The total population of the&#13;
project's area is now several million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
73.        Early attempts at development of the Northern areas of  Parand i.e.&#13;
around 1910, were based on a model that had been successful in the&#13;
northeastern part  of the state  of Sao  Paulo and  in  parts of the state  of&#13;
Minas Gerais.  This was based on opening large  tracks of land for plantations&#13;
growing  coffee.  The early settlers in  Northern  ParanA realized  that  they&#13;
needed more financial assistance in order to be able to extend transportation&#13;
infrastructure, particularly railroads, to the area, and so to relieve their&#13;
relative isolation. One of their efforts to attract additional investments&#13;
into the area was to contact a British technical mission visiting Brazil in&#13;
the early twenties. This mission was looking for lands to establish cotton&#13;
cultivation, similar to the then very successful cotton growing undertaken by&#13;
the Sudan Syndicate. Expected high fertility, low land prices and the&#13;
expectation of rapid appreciation in price of the land because of the&#13;
construction of a railroad, led to the purchase in 1925 of more than 1&#13;
million hectares in the Northern part of the state of ParanA by British&#13;
investory. The original intention, though, to grow cotton, was a complete&#13;
fiasco for a variety of technical reasons. The company had to abandon efforts&#13;
in that direction and decided instead to attempt colonization of the land&#13;
acquired. As a first step the company bought, in 1928, the railroad company&#13;
Sao Paulo-Parana. Also, in preparation for subsequent land sales, the company&#13;
went to great lengths to assure correct and unassailable title to the lands&#13;
acquired.  It went so far as to pay several times  for certain tracts of  land&#13;
to various interests that claimed ownership. In retrospect, the firm title to&#13;
the lands acquired by the company and subsequently sold to small holders has&#13;
proven to be one of the cornerstones of their successful development.&#13;
74.        The   British  company's   development  philosophy   was  radically&#13;
different from  the large plantation-style  development practiced in that part&#13;
of Brazil at the time. Its plans were based on concurrent urban and rural&#13;
development and on linking the area with major domestic and export markets.&#13;
With respect to the latter, the purchase of the railroad from Sao Paulo, and&#13;
its gradual extension into the project area was a crucial factor. The&#13;
company's basic development plan for the undulating terrain was to build&#13;
roads over the crests of the hills, with the properties, like fishbones from&#13;
a central spine, extending downwards along the gently sloping terrain towards&#13;
the rivers in the valleys. Concurrent urban and rural development was&#13;
achieved by planning major cities at roughly every 100 kilometers on the main&#13;
penetration roads and minor towns at intervals of 10 to 15 kilometers. The&#13;
unit size of rural properties to be sold was kept small intentionally, in&#13;
order to achieve a high density rural population, able to support and use the&#13;
growing transport and urban infrastructure. A green belt was conserved around&#13;
cities as well as around towns, in order to settle small producers of&#13;
horticultural products, chickens and eggs, to supply the city and town&#13;
populations with their daily needs. The average rural plot sold was a narrow&#13;
strip of land of approximately 30 hectares, extending from the road running&#13;
along the crest of the terrain to the river at the bottom of the valley. At&#13;
the higher elevations, close to the road, coffee was planted. This is&#13;
generally  the  area  least  affected  by   frost.  The   farmer's  residence,&#13;
horticultural plots, and stables for small livestock were built at the lower&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
parts of the property, close to the river. Water was obtained either from&#13;
tube wells or from the river. In the early 30's, the period of the company's&#13;
major expansion, 30 hectares of land in that part of Brazil was sufficient&#13;
for a small farmer family to be entirely independent. The reason was the&#13;
existence of one secure cash crop, coffee. Throughout the 30's and the 40's,&#13;
Brazil's federal policy with respect to coffee prices and support for coffee&#13;
was crucial for the development of many colonization projects.&#13;
75.        The  price  of  the  land   must have  been affordable to  a  large&#13;
segment of the Brazilian and foreign migrants that moved into the area, given&#13;
the briskness of sales during the initial period of major expansion.&#13;
According to personnel of the still existing development company CMNP&#13;
(Companhia Melhoramentos Norte do Parana), at least 50% of the ultimate land&#13;
buyers started out as rural laborers, saving to buy their plot. Currently&#13;
land is resold, often for the third or the fourth time, at prices of&#13;
approximately US$1,000 per hectare.&#13;
76.        The company  has  always  done  everything necessary to support its&#13;
one and only objective: sell land. Nevertheless, the combined actions taken&#13;
by the company add up to what today might be called an integrated rural&#13;
development project. The company also built and operated hotels, saw mills,&#13;
brick making plants, etc. at the places of intended urban settlements. It&#13;
built the complete water supply systems for most of its cities; it donated&#13;
land and even building materials for churches, hospitals and government&#13;
offices, but it never maintained for its own exploitation any of the&#13;
auxiliary services that were established as an aid to land sales in the first&#13;
place. The company never found it necessary to supply social or even&#13;
production   related   services  on   its   own  account:  health,  education,&#13;
agricultural extension, etc., since the public sector supplied those services&#13;
from the moment they were required. For instance, Maringa, a major city in&#13;
the heart of the company's area, and the current location of the company's&#13;
headquarters, was incorporated as a municipality only 4 years after the first&#13;
house was built, i.e. in 1947. From that moment on it was eligible for the&#13;
usual state and federal support to municipalities and was also able to&#13;
develop its own tax base. Its current population is well over 300,000.&#13;
77.        The  CMNP  has  been  a  fully  Brazilian  owned company  since its&#13;
acquisition in  1944 from  the  original British  interests.  Most of its  500&#13;
share  holders are company employees.  Its current  executive  field director,&#13;
headquartered  in Maringd, was hired by the company as a  railroad engineer in&#13;
1932. In 1975, the company had 22 senior  personnel with more than 30 years of&#13;
service.  Its  total staff currently numbers  approximately  1,500.  Realizing&#13;
that the company finally would run out of land to sell, it was decided, about&#13;
10 to 15 years ago, to diversify into other 'activities. As a result, the&#13;
company now owns and operates 17 farms in Parana and in the state of Sao&#13;
Paulo. The company has the largest cattle herd in the state of Parana and is&#13;
an  important  producer  of  one  of  the  states current  major  cash  crops,&#13;
soybeans.  Furthermore,  the   company  has  diversified  into  a  number   of&#13;
industrial ventures. Moreover, CMNP has been looking actively into the&#13;
possibility of acquiring a large tract of land at today's frontier, in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
state of Matto Grosso, to continue its original activity, land development.&#13;
78.        Criticisms heard  today about the type  of development such as  the&#13;
one pioneered by the CMNP, and later copied by a number of other developers,&#13;
is that the properties sold by the company are really too small. Furthermore,&#13;
the high level of sub-division has led to erosion, and to pollution of the&#13;
rivers along which the settlements have been made. The counter argument of&#13;
company personnel is that the original plan and philosophy of the development&#13;
were based on economic conditions of the twenties. In particular, coffee was&#13;
then the most profitable crop and the clients could afford only relatively&#13;
small areas of land. In other words, the type of development was dictated by&#13;
the reality of economics of the time and by the type of client catered to.&#13;
However, now conditions have changed. Coffee is no longer as profitable in&#13;
this area as it used to be. Through erosion and through lack of maintenance&#13;
of  fertility, the land  has become  gradually poorer.  Erosion and  pollution&#13;
problems,  as  well  as  the gradual deterioration of soil  fertility  may  be&#13;
blamed partially on  a lack  of continued involvement by  the  company and  in&#13;
part upon a lack of vigorous enforcement of existing laws by the public&#13;
sector. For instance, all title deeds contained a covenant that 10% of the&#13;
land of each lot had to be kept in woodlands. This restriction, meant to&#13;
combat erosion, was never enforced, either by the company or by public sector&#13;
authorities. Pertinent farmer training and well focused extension work might&#13;
have helped to maintain soil fertility by different agricultural practices&#13;
and by correct application of fertilizer.&#13;
79.        Current developments on these  tracts of land after a generation of&#13;
farming has taken place, are three-fold. First, there is a tendency to&#13;
aggregate adjacent plots. Farmers sell off to their neighbors and move onto&#13;
lands further inland, particularly in the Matto Grosso. With the money&#13;
obtained from selling their plot in northern Parang, they can buy a&#13;
substantially larger area in current frontier developments. Second, the type&#13;
of products grown on the best lands are changing. Instead of coffee, one can&#13;
see  increasingly   wheat, soybeans, some  other beans, and even castor beans.&#13;
The third type of development is that the poorer lands are gradually taken&#13;
out of intensive farming and put into extensive livestock production. Thus,&#13;
on the one hand, it would appear that the original small holder development&#13;
of CMNP is gradually evolving into an area of medium to large scale&#13;
properties, because it is suffering from a deterioration in quality due to&#13;
erosion and pollution, and therefore shifting gradually from intensive&#13;
farming to extensive cattle production. On the other hand, this development&#13;
managed tc open up more than a million hectares of virgin land, settled about&#13;
50,000 small holders, and was instrumental in the development of an entire&#13;
urban base with various industries, without any public sector subsidy.&#13;

b.    Colombia&#13;
80.        Integrated   rural  development,   both   the   concept   and   its&#13;
implementation,  are   notably  different  in  Colombia  than  in  Brazil.  In&#13;
Colombia, integrated rural development started in 1970, with a few small&#13;
pilot projects. The original emphasis was on the development of agricultural&#13;
production technology that would be appropriate to increase the productivity&#13;
of the traditional small scale farmer in some parts of the country,&#13;
particularly in the mountainous regions close to BogotA and Medellin. Five&#13;
years later, by the middle 70's the pilot program had grown to approximately&#13;
20 projects. By that time, the program's philosophy, and its positive results&#13;
in  terms  of  agricultural   production   increases   had  become  known  and&#13;
appreciated, both in Colombia and abroad. National attention resulted in the&#13;
adoption of the program by a newly elected President and incorporation of&#13;
integrated rural development into national development policy. With the&#13;
strong and personal backing of the president a national program was developed&#13;
with the aid  of international organizations  and the program  was coordinated&#13;
by the National Planning Office.&#13;
81.        Of  fundamental importance  for the  development of the  concept in&#13;
Colombia   has   been  the  early  stress,  by  personnel  of   the  Colombian&#13;
Agricultural  Institute  (ICA), of the  parallel existence  of commercial  and&#13;
subsistence sectors  in  the country's agriculture and  of the different needs&#13;
of each  sector  with  respect  to  extension  and  technical  assistance.  In&#13;
essence, they noted that the commercial sector needed technology only, and&#13;
could  be  relied  upon  to  incorporate  new   knowledge  in  its  production&#13;
practices. The small scale subsistence farmer needed technology plus basic&#13;
assistance, as e.g. education in principles of agronomy and animal production&#13;
in order to be able to assimilate new production technology, while at the&#13;
same time improving his, or her, overall operations and management. ICA was&#13;
uncertain about how to do the latter, although it recognized the inadequacy&#13;
of existing extension methods. In retrospect it can be said that what ICA&#13;
personnel did was to improve upon existing multi-cropping systems of the&#13;
small  farmer,   rather   than  trying   to   introduce   supposedly  superior&#13;
technologies, based on large scale mechanized mono-cropping systems. The idea&#13;
to upgrade existing production systems instead of trying to introduce radical&#13;
change, is an idea that was originally developed in Mexico, and is known as&#13;
the ideas upon which the Mexican Puebla project was based. The direct&#13;
production related technical work was then complemented by actions that were&#13;
indirectly related to production, in particular those that assist farmers to&#13;
obtain credit and to market their excess production. Another decision of&#13;
fundamental importance was to find these additional services for the farmers&#13;
within existing institutions of the public sector, rather than to try and&#13;
supply them as new and integral parts of ICA's own effort. The latter, i.e.&#13;
an all encompassing service had been the strategy of Colombia's land reform&#13;
agency INCORA, a strategy found to lead to much duplication and creation of&#13;
ill will among sectoral agencies. Finally, ICA decided to include attention&#13;
to social aspects such as improvements of diets and nutrition, health&#13;
services and education as part of its rural development efforts. It remains&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
somewhat unclear why these social service components were included with ICA's&#13;
basically production related strategy. Some of the personnel who were&#13;
involved with ICA's early efforts, contend that they thought to have a social&#13;
responsibility to lead increased earnings of farmers' increased production&#13;
into socially acceptable channels. In this somewhat paternalistic view,&#13;
health and education are considered socially acceptable channels, more&#13;
frivolous forms of consumption, such as festivities and drinking, were&#13;
considered not to be socially acceptable or desirable. Others give the&#13;
impression that the inclusion of social components was based upon the desire&#13;
for equity, i.e. the right of the rural poor to services of the public sector&#13;
that were already available to the majority of urban poor.&#13;
82.        In summary,  ICA's original concept of integrated rural development&#13;
projects was area specific, was based on increasing production and income,&#13;
and aimed to induce institutional change in response to the needs expressed&#13;
by farmers and their families. The resulting projects built on the existing&#13;
institutional structure in their area, they did not create new institutions.&#13;
83.        The  rural  development  effort  spearheaded  by  ICA  was  closely&#13;
followed by Colombia's National Planning Office. This office is the technical&#13;
arm of the executive and is responsible for planning and controlling public&#13;
sector investments. It was this office which was given the responsiblity, in&#13;
the middle 70's, to formulate and manage a nationwide program for integrated&#13;
rural development. The first five year program was started in July of 1976&#13;
and was budgeted at the equivalent of 273 million U.S. dollars. The program&#13;
covered selected areas in 8 departments. It was sub-divided into 3 main&#13;
groups of geographic areas, each one supported by a major foreign loan. Of&#13;
the total program, 54% of expenditures were scheduled for production related&#13;
components, i.e. for agricultural credit and for technical assistance to&#13;
agriculture. The DRI program, as it was called, was a true multi-sectoral&#13;
integrated rural development program with its own funds to finance all&#13;
components deemed necessary. Although the National Planning Office was the&#13;
central   coordinator,   with  its  own  directorate   for  integrated   rural&#13;
development,   the   Agricultural  Bank  was   designated   as   the   overall&#13;
administrator of the program and controller of funds. Thus, the National&#13;
Planning Office could limit its role to matters of true managerial concern&#13;
and could minimize its administrative burden. As a result, its directorate of&#13;
integrated  rural   development   has  always  been  relatively   small,  with&#13;
approximately 95 staff at the peak of its activity, in early 1981.&#13;
84.        The  Colombian  integrated  rural  development  program has  gained&#13;
considerable support among the rural population. Partly as a result of this,&#13;
its political support at all government levels, in both parties, and in the&#13;
legislature is substantial. Unfortunately, this support is a mixed blessing&#13;
since the project and its institutions are coming under pressure from&#13;
politicians trying to use them to advance other than project related&#13;
interests. Also, the high visibility of the program has revived bureaucratic&#13;
struggles for control. Currently, the Ministry of Agriculture is laying claim&#13;
to the  coordination responsibility of the coTÂ¶ined  DRI and PAN program  (the&#13;
food supply program to poor urban consumers).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
85.        With respect to  its prime objective, the increase  of agricultural&#13;
production in the areas under the program, the integrated rural development&#13;
program in Colombia is a success. Production increases of many crops have&#13;
been large, to the extent that they created marketing problems. Participation&#13;
in decision making by the beneficiary farmers and their families has been&#13;
kept at a modest institutionalized level. From the outset, the government did&#13;
not wish to create entities that might come under the control of one&#13;
political party or another, as has happened in the past in Colombia in&#13;
similar    rural   development   efforts.    Beneficiary    participation   is&#13;
institutionalized through four levels of committees, from the village level&#13;
up to the national level. Reportedly, this form of popular involvement in&#13;
development aspects declines once the projects proper are finished. Community&#13;
development, aiming at political education of the rural population as in&#13;
Brazil, is not attempted in Colombia.&#13;
86.        In  spite  of  national commitment, and  support from  the  highest&#13;
levels   of   the   executive,  coordination   between  the  various  sectoral&#13;
institutions involved in Colombia's integrated rural development projects&#13;
remains a problem. In particular, it remains difficult to implement health&#13;
and education components in these projects. Consistently, implementation&#13;
goals for rural health centers and for schools have not been reached. As a&#13;
result,   arguments  are   advanced   against   including  social,   and  even&#13;
infrastructure components  in  rural development projects. However,  among the&#13;
advantages of the integrated approach, including social components, are&#13;
cited: close financial control by a central agency, appropriate phasing of&#13;
works in relation with overall development goals, and the certainty of having&#13;
social components in integrated rural development projects, components that&#13;
may never materialize through nationwide sectoral programs.&#13;
87.        A  serious  omission in the entire DRI program in  Colombia  is the&#13;
absence of an independent, thorough and consistent monitoring and evaluation&#13;
effort. The evaluation unit established in the early years of the program, in&#13;
the offices of the directorate never gained the necessary independence.&#13;
88.        It is inevitable that  national programs, such as  the DRI  program&#13;
in  Colombia,  will  be  influenced  by  changes  in  national   policy.  When&#13;
conceived,  Colombia's  integrated   rural  development  program  was  poverty&#13;
oriented and its emphasis was on raising living standards in rural areas,&#13;
albeit primarily through raising production. Gradually, though, the emphasis&#13;
of the program has shifted away from its focus on poverty, i.e. on increasing&#13;
the living standards of the target population, towards a focus on food&#13;
production,  i.e.  on   increasing  the  marketable   surplus  of  the  target&#13;
population. The practical result of the shift in emphasis is that now areas&#13;
and target populations of projects are being chosen only on the basis of&#13;
their production potential. Alleviation of poverty is a welcome but not&#13;
necessary, secondary benefit.&#13;
89.        In retrospect,  a number  of  reasons  can  be  identified  for the&#13;
successful growth and for the continuity of Colombia's integrated rural&#13;
development program. First, the Colombian program has shown consistent growth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
from a small, pilot scale operation run by a group of young and dedicated&#13;
local professionals to a virtually nationwide program. Second, a firm&#13;
political commitment to the program was made at a crucial point in its&#13;
development, i.e. when the transition had to be made from a number of&#13;
successful pilot projects to a multi-area scale program. Third, the program&#13;
developed its own technology in response to the real needs of its clientele,&#13;
the small farmers. Fourth, the projects were able to work within long&#13;
established communities and therefore, community development in the sense of&#13;
creating associations of beneficiaries was never required in Colombia. Fifth,&#13;
farming has traditionally enjoyed a high social status in Colombia. As a&#13;
result, there is not only a national development policy with respect to&#13;
agriculture but there is also a reservoir of well trained professionals with&#13;
motivation and dedication to do agricultural and rural development related&#13;
work. And lastly, once large scale international support was called for the&#13;
World Bank played a constructive, yet flexible, role in further refining and&#13;
implementing integrated rural development as defined in Colombia. Finally, in&#13;
the operational phase of the program, the Bank and other donors gave&#13;
continuity to the program, in part making up for discontinuities resulting&#13;
from frequent turnover of personnel in local offices of public sector&#13;
agencies.&#13;
c.    Ecuador&#13;
90.         The  history  of organized  rural  development  in  Ecuador  can be&#13;
traced back to the community development concept of the 50's. Of particular&#13;
importance was a project in Santo Domingo de los Colorados started around&#13;
1958  by  the  National  Institute  for   Colonization  with  support  of  the&#13;
Inter-American  Development   Bank.   This   project   supported   spontaneous&#13;
colonization in the area and, for the first time in Ecuador, included a&#13;
number of unrelated components. The central idea was to normalize land&#13;
titling for the settlers to make them eligible for agricultural credit, but&#13;
the government also assigned resources for the construction of schools,&#13;
health posts and other communal services. The project in Santo Domingo de los&#13;
Colorados was meant to develop a specific area and as such was a concept of&#13;
regional planning which supported the development of not only the small&#13;
farmer  but   also   of   other  inhabitants  of  the  area,   such  as  small&#13;
entrepreneurs, tradesmen and others living in the villages.&#13;
91.        Between 1975 and  1980 a  number  of  international agencies became&#13;
active in Ecuador to promote and institutionalize the idea of integrated&#13;
rural development. The World Bank lent four million dollars to the National&#13;
Planning Office, with which the preparatory work for the current integrated&#13;
rural development project in Tungurahua, as well as some minor projects, were&#13;
financed.  The  organization  of  American  States,  the  FAO,  AID,  and  the&#13;
Inter-American Institute  for  Agricultural Sciences (IICA) all were active in&#13;
the  same period  promoting similar  projects. As  a result,  a  fairly  large&#13;
number of projects were  formulated,  each one with  a particular emphasis and&#13;
methodology. Furthermore, a large number of public sector institutions was&#13;
assigned the responsibility for implementation of one or another of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
projects. By the end of the 70's a rather chaotic situation was developing&#13;
and it seemed necessary to plan and organize integrated rural development on&#13;
a national level.&#13;
92.        As a result, in October of 1980, the  government established  a new&#13;
institutional framework to promote integrated rural development within the&#13;
public sector. Under this system, the National Development Council proposes,&#13;
yearly, a national program to the president based on a rural development&#13;
policy formulated by the same Council. The Council remains responsible for&#13;
monitoring and evaluating the program but by the same decree of October,&#13;
1980, a secretariat for integrated rural development (SEDRI) was created.&#13;
This executive office of the rural development program is attached to the&#13;
office of the President of the Republic and is responsible for programming,&#13;
preparation and coordination of implementation and channeling of funds to all&#13;
rural   development  projects   included  in  the  National  Development  Plan&#13;
s:urrently 17). Project implementation is the responsibility of executing&#13;
tlits to be established for each project. It is expected that these executing&#13;
units will get broad based support, particularly with respect to attracting&#13;
personnel,  from  ministries  as  well  as  from  other   public  and  private&#13;
specialized agencies. The rural development program is financed through an&#13;
integrated rural development fund (FONADRI) in the central bank. SEDRI has to&#13;
channel all funds, both local and external, through this rural development&#13;
fund. Because of its independent position, and its direct access to the&#13;
President, SEDRI enjoys substantial political and bureaucratic influence. In&#13;
principle it should thus be able to effect adequate coordination among&#13;
government   agencies  and  should  in  general  be   able   to  expedite  the&#13;
implementation of integrated rural development projects. In reality, though,&#13;
its effectiveness depends on its secretary, who has the full power to use or&#13;
not to use the influence of his office.&#13;
93.        According to project personnel  in Ecuador,  their  projects suffer&#13;
from the same coordination problems as similar projects elsewhere. Project&#13;
execution units are mainly composed of people who are seconded by the various&#13;
sectoral agencies, such as by the ministry of agriculture, the ministry of&#13;
education, the ministry of health, etc. This staff remains on the payroll of&#13;
their  parent   institutions  and   hence,   their  loyalty   remains   there.&#13;
Furthermore, they bring  with them  the traditional way  of operation to which&#13;
they were accustomed in the other institutions. Not being attuned to working&#13;
with small farmers, and not understanding rural societies, the majority of&#13;
this   personnel  faces  an  initial,  difficult,   period  of   learning  and&#13;
adaptation. Since they are selected by their own institutions, they are often&#13;
those that are considered less efficient and project units are thus saddled&#13;
with a staff that has low motivation to do the work they are supposed to do,&#13;
over which management has very little discipline, and which is engrained in a&#13;
traditional  way   of  work.   Another   major  problem  is   lacking  project&#13;
preparation. Staff is often moved to the countryside where they are literally&#13;
left to themselves to try to define their task and it can take more than a&#13;
year to begin to understand the area they are working in and to begin to&#13;
pinpoint some of the problems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
94.        National   coordination,  through   SEDRI,   of   Ecuador's   rural&#13;
development efforts is too recent to be commented on meaningfully. It will&#13;
take some time before  the dispersed  and  fragmented efforts of the past will&#13;
have been integrated into one program and will show some unity of purpose and&#13;
focus. However, what can be seen already, is a tendency to redefine the&#13;
clientele of integrated rural development projects in the sense of trying to&#13;
work with the poorest segments of society. Also, there appears to be an&#13;
increased emphasis on trying to re-establish and reinforce the traditional&#13;
rural   societies,   particularly   those   among   the  indigenous   highland&#13;
populations. Thus, there is perhaps a move away from the focus on economic&#13;
results towards socio-political objectives.&#13;
95.        Ecuador  also  has  private,  non-governmental,  efforts  at  rural&#13;
development. Among  the  institutions engaged in this work, the most prominent&#13;
is  probably  the   Central Ecuatoriana de Servicios Agricolas  (CESA).   This&#13;
organization was established in 1967 by the Roman Catholic Church of Ecuador&#13;
to manage its land reform program and, particularly, to assist and organize&#13;
the small farmers that were going to benefit from that program. However, the&#13;
ambitious   goals  of  the  Church's  agrarian  reform  were  never  realized,&#13;
specifically in respect of the total Church land to be ceded to farmers. In&#13;
effect, by 1972, the reform had stopped altogether. CESA was then working&#13;
with 7 farmer cooperatives, 5 on the altiplano and 2 on the coast, on 7&#13;
properties that used to belong to various institutions of the Catholic&#13;
Church. CESA's management decided to continue assisting small farmers and to&#13;
wean itself from its identification with the Catholic Church. To-day, about&#13;
80% of all CESA's expenses and project related costs are covered by a variety&#13;
of sources, mostly in the form of donations, with or without a religious&#13;
denomination. Major support is extended by European aid organizations. The&#13;
remaining 20% are generated by a number of auxiliary activities, such as&#13;
rental from a pool of agricultural and road maintenance equipment, occasional&#13;
consulting work for third parties, sale of publications, and the operation of&#13;
a seed certifying and packing plant.&#13;
96.         In 1983, CESA had 77 personnel,  the majority working in the field.&#13;
It had 26 projects under execution with a total estimated cost of about 5.8&#13;
million dollars. CESA still works in, and particularly around, the original 7&#13;
areas where it started its activities in relation with the agrarian reform of&#13;
the Church. At any point in time, CESA's field personnel reportedly works&#13;
with  about  150 to 200 groups of an average of 35  families with, in turn, an&#13;
average  of 5 members per family. Thus, at any point CESA  works actively with&#13;
about 5,000 to 7,000 rural families, representing between 25,000 and 35,000&#13;
people.&#13;
97.         CESA's aim is to teach organizations of small  farmers  to fend for&#13;
themselves, to assert their place in society and to use and demand social&#13;
services  considered  rightfully  theirs.  The   process  is  referred  to  as&#13;
"capacitaci6n".  Beneficiary  participation  is  thus  an  integral   part  of&#13;
anything done by CESA for or with farmer organizations. CESA tries to work&#13;
with the poorest segment of Ecuador's rural population, the part its staff&#13;
calls "marginados". Because of the emphasis on the rural poorest and because&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
of CESA's concentration on the altiplano, the institution works predominantly&#13;
with the autochtone population of the highlands, Quechua Indians. This&#13;
population has a tradition of communal ownership of land and of communal&#13;
action, working in "mingas" as it is called in Ecuador. Thus, it was never&#13;
necessary, as it is for instance in Brazil, to start with organizing the&#13;
target population into some kind of association. As a matter of fact, CESA&#13;
does not work with individual farmers, or farm families, but with their&#13;
associations. Projects are for the benefit of the community: services such as&#13;
credit are extended exclusively to groups, formed de jure or de facto. CESA's&#13;
operational   philosophy   is  obviously  to  revive  and  to  reinforce   the&#13;
traditional community organization of Ecuador's Quechua Indians, aiming at&#13;
the same time to integrate these people, through their associations, into&#13;
present day Ecuadorian society. Typically, about 60% of the total income of a&#13;
poor rural family in an area where CESA operates is attributable to sale of&#13;
agricultural production and to an imputed value of what is used for the&#13;
families' subsistence. About 40% of the family income is derived from&#13;
non-agricultural sources, such as part-time wage employment by some family&#13;
members, trade or services. This is fairly typical of the rural poor in Latin&#13;
America.&#13;
98.         CESA's  field staff  lives either  in the area of activity or close&#13;
by. Through frequent visits to the communities they slowly establish a&#13;
relationship of trust. The development of a workable relationship takes at&#13;
least two years and sometimes four or more, similar to the experience in&#13;
other countries. Relatively small, immediate, actions are used to develop and&#13;
cement the relationship. The activities most often carried out with and for&#13;
the  communities  are:  assistance  with  obtaining  credit   and  later  with&#13;
marketing; technical assistance with production, initially in the form of&#13;
demonstration and trial plots, later in the form of assistance with obtaining&#13;
inputs; and the construction of irrigation and potable water systems. With&#13;
respect to services offered and the infrastructure projects undertaken, it is&#13;
CESA's rule that the communities should shoulder the burden to the maximum&#13;
extent possible.&#13;
99.         CESA  promotes  the renewal and  the reinforcement  of  the age-old&#13;
social  structures of  the  Quechua  highland  indians, which  CESA  personnel&#13;
apparently sees as highly egalitarian. But trying to increase the marketable&#13;
surplus of the small producer, or trying to make him less of a subsistence&#13;
and more of a market oriented farmer, tends to increase the differences&#13;
within these traditional societies. According to CESA personnel, it is almost&#13;
inevitable that those who are already doing some marketing will benefit most&#13;
from production and marketing related activities in a project. Also, if land&#13;
is made available for purchase under the project the most progressive farmers&#13;
will  use the opportunity   more often than  the smaller or  poorer members of&#13;
society. As a  consequence, CESA actively tries to  obtain a   distribution of&#13;
project benefits that is as equitable as possible and thus, limits the&#13;
possibility  for  the  most  progressive  members  of   society   to   benefit&#13;
extraordinarily from the  project. For instance,  in  one irrigation  project,&#13;
CESA's assistance is limited to financing one hectare of fruit trees per&#13;
farmer. In the same area, CESA has purchased land which is called a "land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
bank". CESA tries to convince groups of farmers in the area that only those&#13;
among them who have the smallest areas of land should be eligible to buy land&#13;
out of this land bank.&#13;
100.        In line  with experiences elsewhere,  even an organization  as CESA&#13;
does not  have an  institutionalized monitoring and evaluation effort. One has&#13;
to depend upon the memory, and upon the willingness to talk, of senior&#13;
personnel who have been with the organization for a long time. There are no&#13;
periodic reports about the organization's activities. Nobody seems to know&#13;
how many projects were undertaken in the past, at what cost and with what&#13;
benefits. There is a lot of basic information and there is a lot of paper,&#13;
but no systematic analysis of the information is contained in the various&#13;
documents, reports and memoranda. As usual, the information is there, in some&#13;
form. However, it is not categorized and there is no systematic analysis.&#13;
d.    Mexico&#13;
101.       The emphasis  of the Mexican field work has been somewhat different&#13;
from the emphasis of the field work in the other three countries. Since&#13;
Mexico has the oldest, and largest, nationwide integrated rural development&#13;
program its experience has been used to corroborate our findings elsewhere.&#13;
In particular, Mexico's experience with beneficiary participation provides&#13;
some insights into this complex problem.&#13;
102.       The  PIDER  program  in  Mexico  is one of  the  oldest  nationwide&#13;
integrated rural development efforts in Latin America. It is also one of the&#13;
most often cited examples of a government's attempt to coordinate the process&#13;
of  rural  development  planning and  implementation at  the  national  level.&#13;
Through PIDER, and subsequently through other public sector institutions, the&#13;
Mexican government has tried to put into practice many of the key theoretical&#13;
concepts of integrated rural development.&#13;
103.       PIDER  was started in 1973  as  a  public  investment  program  for&#13;
promoting development in rural sectors in Mexico which had not benefitted&#13;
from earlier agricultural development projects like large scale irrigation&#13;
works.   Although  these  old  style  agricultural  and  rural  infrastructure&#13;
projects increased production among a small group of large farmers, they did&#13;
not generate enough employment, nor did they increase production sufficiently&#13;
to materially improve the lot of the subsistence farmer and rural laborer.&#13;
The old style projects tended to increase the disparity in wealth and income&#13;
between classes of the rural society. The growing relative impoverishment of&#13;
small rural producers and landless laborers loomed as a major political and&#13;
economic problem for the Mexican government by the early 70's. A corollary of&#13;
the continued and aggravating situation in the rural areas was the increased&#13;
migration of rural poor to urban centers and to the U.S.A. in search of work.&#13;
104.       PIDER   developed  in  response   to  this  critical  situation  of&#13;
pervasive  rural   unemployment  and  seasonal  underemployment.  The  Mexican&#13;
government concluded that the small scale farmer could not realize his&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
productive potential without direct government intervention, because he did&#13;
not have access to the necessary productive and social infrastructure.&#13;
Furthermore, there was a growing belief among Mexican policy makers that&#13;
increased production among subsistence farmers was essential for attaining&#13;
self sufficiency in the production of basic foods.&#13;
105.       In order to  fulfil  its  role as  an  integrated rural development&#13;
program, PIDER ascribes to three general objectives. First, generate and&#13;
retain economic surpluses within circumscribed rural regions that have a&#13;
potential   for  production   increase,   by  promoting  self   sustained  and&#13;
participatory development among small rural producers. Second, channel newly&#13;
generated income into productive investments. And, third, guarantee access to&#13;
minimum levels of social welfare for the rural poor.&#13;
106.       In  order  to  attain  these  objectives,  PIDER  has a  number  of&#13;
operating principles, the most important of which attaches priority to&#13;
productive investments, which must  total 70% of its  operating budget in  any&#13;
one state. The remainder 30% are split between social services (20%) and&#13;
infrastructure (10%). The 70-20-10% split must hold state wide but can vary&#13;
within a particular community or region according to the needs of that area.&#13;
The emphasis on production potential also accounts for the restrictions&#13;
specifying that PIDER micro-regions, as they are called, must have overall&#13;
productive potential, while target communities must be no smaller than 500&#13;
inhabitants and no larger than 5,000. A second operating principle is that&#13;
all investments, i.e. those in production, social services and infrastructure&#13;
related  components  have  to  be  multi-sectoral.  Hence,  PIDER  investments&#13;
typically are in agriculture, small industry, in education, in health and in&#13;
commerce, among others. PIDER coordinates investments through government line&#13;
agencies and supervises projects financed by PIDER allocations. The program&#13;
as such does not execute projects directly in the community. A third and&#13;
important operational characteristic is that the program is decentralized.&#13;
Much of the planning is undertaken at the local and state levels and the&#13;
implementation of projects is the responsibility of 27 government line&#13;
agencies. Finally, program and planning implemention in PIDER are supposedly&#13;
participative  processes,  involving  planners   and   technicians   from  the&#13;
government   line  agencies  as  well  as  the   beneficiaries  in  the  rural&#13;
communities.&#13;
107.       PIDER  officials,  in  collaboration  with  staff  of   its   major&#13;
international funder, The World Bank, undertook a mid-term evaluation in 1978&#13;
which identified 4 major operational problems. These were: a lack of&#13;
capability for multi-year investment programming at the state level; poor&#13;
preparation of individual projects; limited beneficiary participation; and&#13;
poor coordination between federal and state agencies involved in the program.&#13;
As a result of this evaluation, PIDER, and the Mexican government, emphasized&#13;
decentralizing project planning and implementation by giving state and&#13;
municipal governments a much greater role in determining how PIDER funds&#13;
would be invested. Furthermore, PIDER administrators developed 4 operational&#13;
programs   with  the  objectives   to   improve  project   identification  and&#13;
preparation, to encourage beneficiary participation, to reinforce social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
economic studies, and to conduct evaluations.&#13;
108.       Over  the years,  beneficiary participation  and  organization have&#13;
been repeatedly mentioned, together with two other related factors, technical&#13;
assistance and credit availability, as the most prominent problems impeding&#13;
success of PIDER's nation wide program. Nevertheless, PIDER has as yet been&#13;
unable  to  systematize  beneficiary  involvement  in   project  planning  and&#13;
implementation, despite the production of several manuals and working papers&#13;
addressing to this problem.&#13;
109.       Field   work   shows   that  the  main  problems   of   beneficiary&#13;
participation  are  as   follows.  First,   beneficiaries  frequently  do  not&#13;
contribute either labor or capital resources to infrastructural works and&#13;
therefore do not develop a sense of proprietorship, nor of responsibility for&#13;
the finished projects. Second, the peasants role in defining their needs and&#13;
the appropriate solutions for their problems is constrained by inflexible&#13;
bureaucratic procedures, by insufficient numbers of trained field personnel,&#13;
and by   a lack  of involving peasants  in  making decisions  about  their own&#13;
development.   Third,   fears   of  political  repercussions   and  inadequate&#13;
understanding of already existing social organizations in peasant communities&#13;
prevent   PIDER   from  institutionalizing  their  beneficiary  participation.&#13;
Fourth, PIDER, and more importantly, the executing line agencies do not give&#13;
enough importance to training beneficiaries and extension staff in a fashion&#13;
that would encourage participation. In particular, the institutions fail to&#13;
recognize what extension agents and planners can learn from the peasants if&#13;
training were conceived of as a two way process between the personnel of the&#13;
institutions and the beneficiaries.&#13;
110.       In  summary,  the principles  guiding  the  quest  for  beneficiary&#13;
participation in PIDER projects remain abstract and non-operational. Lacking&#13;
concrete procedures, the line agencies and credit banks implementing PIDER&#13;
investments procede in the top-down manner to which they are accustomed. In&#13;
many instances, the beneficiaries feel that development is dictated to them&#13;
but not really useful for them. They take an active role in planning and&#13;
executing projects only when line agencies and peasants are able to adapt to&#13;
each others values and procedures.&#13;
Ill.       The  general consensus among  PIDER staff in the State  of Nayarit,&#13;
for example, was that there are three basic problems afflicting PIDER in&#13;
Mexico: administration and organization of beneficiary groups and government&#13;
agencies; administration and supervision of credit for small rural producers;&#13;
and the market structure that controls the distribution of rural produce. The&#13;
same staff attributes many of its day to day problems with its projects to&#13;
PIDER's lack of authority and influence over the line agencies charged with&#13;
executing its projects. In the opinion of PIDER's staff, their institution,&#13;
the many other public sector agencies dealing with rural development and any&#13;
future programs dealing with the same problems should all be administered by&#13;
a central coordinating committee for rural development and the present system&#13;
for processing project proposals and disbursing funds should be simplified&#13;
and standardized to allow the beneficiaries to participate more fully in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
directing these procedures. Currently, there is too much competition among&#13;
programs and line agencies for the attention of the prospective participants,&#13;
whose patience and interest are tried by government officials' opulent&#13;
promises that have little substance.&#13;
112.       Local  PIDER  staff  also considers that the organizational schemes&#13;
sent to them by the Mexico City office of PIDER are usually inadequate&#13;
solutions for their particular problems. They believe that it is impossible&#13;
to develop packaged program guidelines that will be appropriate for the&#13;
varied social, ecological, economic, and cultural conditions throughout&#13;
Mexico. They say that  their  own efforts to develop local methodologies based&#13;
on their own study of the reality of the local society are hampered because&#13;
they have to comply with the requirements of irrelevant programs developed in&#13;
Mexico City.&#13;
113.       Project personnel  in Nayarit  gave several  examples  of  projects&#13;
that urgently need to be supported with technical supervision and training&#13;
and commercial and organizational orientation for the beneficiaries, but&#13;
there is no supervision of projects other than that provided by the credit&#13;
banks and line agencies when they deem it necessary. The quality of&#13;
supervision and training is very uneven, depending on the relative importance&#13;
that different government agencies assign to these tasks.&#13;
114.       Similar  opinions  with  respect  to  decentralization  of  project&#13;
authority were voiced by PIDER staff in the State of Chihuahua. They contend&#13;
that many states now have qualified personnel that is capable of managing&#13;
rural investment programs directly with very little help from the federal&#13;
government. They regard the review of each project by PIDER officials in&#13;
Mexico City as superfluous and unwieldy. In the opinion of Chihuahua's staff,&#13;
the officials in Mexico City should confine their work to defining policy and&#13;
to developing better relations between line agencies' officials to facilitate&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
115.       PIDER  personnel in Chihuahua  attributes  the relative  success of&#13;
their programs to their field agents' knowledge and experience with rural&#13;
conditions particular to their state. They assert that investment programs&#13;
work well when the people directing and executing them have first hand, long&#13;
term and fairly permanent involvement in rural areas as the majority of the&#13;
Chihuahua staff which is from rural areas within the state. The PIDER&#13;
extension agents in Chihuahua live in the field and even the state delegate&#13;
and the director of PIDER in Chihuahua maintain face-to-face contact with the&#13;
beneficiaries through frequent visits to rural communities.&#13;
116.       PIDER's staff  in  Chihuahua  believe that  organization of peasant&#13;
groups should receive greater emphasis in PIDER projects. With respect to the&#13;
role of international organizations, PIDER staff in Chihuahua asserts that&#13;
these organizations could contribute more positively to rural development if&#13;
their personnel had a more intimate understanding of the complexity and&#13;
diversity of rural, social and economic conditions in the various regions of&#13;
Mexico. They recommend more frequent extended trips to the countryside by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
personnel of international organizations, as well as a greater use of&#13;
consultants and advisors in  rural areas rather  than in capital cities.  They&#13;
saw great potential benefits from working directly with field technicians  and&#13;
peasants to develop appropriate technical packages and viable organizational&#13;
forms.&#13;
4.    Synthesis of Field Experience&#13;
117.       Field experience suggests a number  of  major issues  which recur -&#13;
although in varying form - in many integrated rural development projects.&#13;
These will be discussed below in a summary fashion to provide the framework&#13;
for some suggestions which will be made in the concluding chapter.&#13;
118.       The first and most difficult problem concerns the varying  priority&#13;
and importance given to the three major groups of components of integrated&#13;
rural   development   projects :   productive,   infrastructure   and   social&#13;
components. The motivation for including individual components often differs&#13;
widely  and  motives   are  not  necessarily  complementary.   The  productive&#13;
component - and sometimes the supporting infrastructure component - is&#13;
motivated by primarily material objectives, i.e. to increase production of&#13;
basic foods, exportable surpluses, etc. The social component more often has&#13;
an ethical background in humanitarian and equity considerations. It is&#13;
generally alleged - probably with some reason - that the social components&#13;
contribute  considerably  to  reaching   the   objectives  of  the  productive&#13;
components, although this is difficult to prove conclusively and impossible&#13;
to  measure.  The  conflicting  motives  come   into  play  when  cost/benefit&#13;
calculations are made. Obviously, social components increase the cost of a&#13;
project but their benefits cannot be measured except through very rough&#13;
estimates which quickly become fairly  ethereal. Since an  additional  feature&#13;
of these projects is their long gestation period, it is quite difficult to&#13;
obtain (and demonstrate) a statisfactory rate of return on the basis of&#13;
measurable benefits only, particularly if the social components are large and&#13;
if benefits are discounted by a high opportunity cost for capital. Hence,&#13;
there is an urge to obtain - or at least show in appraisal - early measurable&#13;
benefits. This urge can translate into counterproductive haste in project&#13;
implementation and often this haste comes in addition to some haste already&#13;
experienced during project preparation and appraisal due to the general&#13;
desire to lend more and quickly for rural development. The consequences are&#13;
twofold: social components tend to get short shrift in crises situations&#13;
(lack of funds, etc.) and over the life of many projects there is a&#13;
noticeable drift away from the social components and toward the productive&#13;
components, the latter sometimes even at the expense of the infrastructure&#13;
component. One of the major suggestions in the next chapter is based on these&#13;
observations.&#13;
119.       Another issue  raised  frequently  is beneficiary  participation in&#13;
integrated rural development projects. There seems to be a consensus that a&#13;
certain degree of beneficiary participation is a precondition for success in&#13;
most projects. But beyond this consensus there is no clear agreement on what&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
beneficiary   participation   includes  and  how   far   it  should  go.  Most&#13;
difficulties arise from misinterpretation of the beneficiary's, i.e. the&#13;
small farmer's, position and mentality, since professional developers tend to&#13;
assume that the small farmer is, of course, ready and eager to go for&#13;
development. In most cases, however, this is not correct. Small farmers have&#13;
usually lived for generations on the edge of subsistence and managed to&#13;
survive somehow. To them "development" is a highly risky business, proposed&#13;
by a government they habitually distrust, involving often drastic departures&#13;
from perhaps poor, but proven techiques. Obviously, such clients need to be&#13;
convinced and won over to the idea of development and new techniques. To&#13;
achieve this they must be involved, both in the process of determining the&#13;
methods and techniques to be employed and in the major decisions made about&#13;
the future course of their lives. The first step in generating beneficiary&#13;
participation is therefore to shed feelings of superiority and study the&#13;
client of this type of project with the purpose of involving him already in&#13;
the project preparation stage to make sure that the project includes&#13;
components that he wants and understands and that techiques will be at least&#13;
grosso modo acceptable to him.&#13;
120.       The next  step then involves the promotion of  a fundamental change&#13;
in the attitude of the client - usually referred to as "human development" -&#13;
by shifting him from a defensive, subsistence/survival-oriented attitude&#13;
towards an agressive, market oriented producer attitude. Such a change is&#13;
neither easy nor can it be accomplished in the relatively short periods of&#13;
time that discounted cost/benefit analysis demand. Again, patience rather&#13;
than haste would be indicated and, as an aside, the emphasis should not be&#13;
exclusively on production but  also on selling the  output, i.e. marketing the&#13;
surplus.&#13;
121.       The  points  made  above  suggest  that  a  rather  intensive human&#13;
contact between project personnel and client is needed. Consequently, the&#13;
size of project area and population becomes a significant factor, as well as&#13;
the personal attitudes and qualifications of project personnel. Unless one&#13;
has available an army of suitable project officers, it seems essential to&#13;
adapt the project area to the number of personnel rather than to finances&#13;
available, as is often the case, particularly when there is a political&#13;
motive for "bringing development to the rural poor of the (entire) country".&#13;
With regard to the quality of project personnel, however, the problem of&#13;
component choices resurfaces. Experience shows that socially motivated,&#13;
dedicated personnel - which is excellent for winning the farmer's confidence&#13;
and for promoting the social components - often lacks the technical know-how&#13;
to be of much help in implementing the productive components. Finally, the&#13;
situation also raises the cost/benefit question to a particularly difficult&#13;
emotional and political level : Transforming the poor, backward subsistence&#13;
farming sector - a quite large one in most countries - into an efficient,&#13;
commercially oriented sector is undoubtedly a very major undertaking with&#13;
very major long term benefits. But equally certain is that it requires a very&#13;
intensive and quite costly effort over a prolonged period of time if it is to&#13;
succeed. Arithmetic cost/benefit calculations cannot possibly reflect all the&#13;
factors involved and therefore there remains a larger than usual proportion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
of decision-making which must be based on qualitative evaluation, i.e. on&#13;
human judgment.&#13;
122.       Another  problem  encountered in the  field  is the  difficulty  of&#13;
coordinating   the   various    agencies   which   usually   participate    in&#13;
multi-component projects. The causes for this problem range from simple&#13;
administrative chaos to political rivalry and power fights between the&#13;
agencies which, unfortunately, more often than not affects the regular and&#13;
timely provision of finance. But there is no general pattern to these&#13;
difficulties. They must be analysed and dealt with in each individual case,&#13;
which may vary considerably, sometimes within the same country (compare e.g.&#13;
the Northeast and Minas Gerais in Brazil).&#13;
123.        Finally,  a  conclusion  can  be  drawn  from  practical experience&#13;
regarding the objectives that integrated rural development projects cannot&#13;
achieve, be it for practical or political reasons. First, these projects&#13;
apparently cannot take care of all the rural poor but in general only of the&#13;
small  farmers,  although  secondary  effects  of   successful  projects  will&#13;
certainly benefit the landless rural poor, who for instance benefit directly&#13;
from the welfare effect of the social components. Second, these projects&#13;
cannot solve the problem of land distribution, which is usually well beyond&#13;
the relatively small scale of a successful IRD project. However, the projects&#13;
can and should contribute to the solution of the many land tenure problems.&#13;
Security of tenure is a precondition for obtaining credit in most countries&#13;
and the uncertainties about land tenure can be tackled and resolved (titling,&#13;
registration of titles, etc.).&#13;
124.       There  remains  the question whether these  projects work  and  are&#13;
worthwhile. The answer is a qualified yes. They can be made to work if an&#13;
adequate human effort is made in addition to providing finance. That means,&#13;
however, that they can be made successful only at a certain cost and will&#13;
rarely produce an impressive rate of return on a discounted basis. However,&#13;
it should not be forgotten that part of the industrial development effort in&#13;
many of these countries turns out - ex post - to have been costly and has&#13;
shown good rates of return only after a large part of project cost had to be&#13;
written off as "sunk investment". Perhaps one problem of integrated rural&#13;
development  projects  is  that   it  is  impossible  to  base  appraisals  on&#13;
optimistic assumptions about the results that new equipment and techniques&#13;
will produce, since the real improved in this sector occurs in human capital&#13;
rather than equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
D.    THREE SUGGESTIONS&#13;
125.       The principal conclusion of  the field work was that  IRD  projects&#13;
need a larger, more intensive input of project staff time to produce the&#13;
desired changes in attitudes and modes of production of small farmers. At the&#13;
same time it was realized that this raised difficult cost/benefit questions&#13;
because of the long lead time before substantial measurable benefits are&#13;
produced. This leads to three suggestions on how to circumvent this problem&#13;
in (1) modifying the traditional IRD approach; (2) splitting the task between&#13;
the private and public sector, and (3) using free or low cost sector help&#13;
from private organizations to bring down the cost of extended intensive work&#13;
with the small farmer.&#13;
1.    A Participatory IRD Program Approach&#13;
126.       The  suggestion for a broad based,  flexible, programmatic approach&#13;
to rural development, embedding specific projects when and where needed and&#13;
asked for, is based on the observations of actual project development in all&#13;
four countries where field visits were made. The development pattern of most&#13;
projects observed can almost be called organic, and appears to be related to&#13;
the nature of the work undertaken. Rarely do projects and particularly their&#13;
timetables follow the programming as laid down by the project designers.&#13;
Often project design, and hence its attempted implementation, do not fully&#13;
recognize   the  human  development  component  of   these  projects.  Rather,&#13;
technical considerations prevail. Rural development is equated mechanically&#13;
with production increases, better marketing, infrastructure development and&#13;
the supply of social services. Essentially, it is a design to bring goods and&#13;
services to people, without considering if these people need them, want them,&#13;
or will be able to use them.&#13;
127.       In  recognition of the fact that rural development largely is human&#13;
development we propose support for multi-task programs, de-centralized at the&#13;
very local level, truly national in conduct and approach, working in an&#13;
iterative fashion with the rural poor.&#13;
a.    Arguments and Ideas&#13;
128.       The design of  integrated rural development projects  usually still&#13;
follows the design patterns of traditional engineering and infrastructure&#13;
projects, which involves admitting some risks and uncertainties, but assuming&#13;
that these can be dealt with in an orderly, and particularly in an&#13;
expeditious manner. In essence, we assume that we have sufficient information&#13;
ex-ante to plan the entire project and to predict its outcome with confidence&#13;
although, if design changes prove necessary during implementation they will&#13;
of course be made. And, indeed, we achieve remarkable successes with this&#13;
engineering approach to technical problems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
129.       However,  when  the project  is to  change  and  develop  people we&#13;
cannot a-priori assume that we have a clear cut design or even that we will&#13;
overcome all problems we encounter; the uncertainties in human development&#13;
are much larger, our information base is much narrower and the analytical and&#13;
strategic tools we have developed so far are much less precise, than what we&#13;
have available for more technical projects. Project personnel repeatedly&#13;
admitted that the design of first projects, in new areas, by personnel&#13;
without topical experience is done in a vacuum. In essence, they do not know&#13;
how to do what they propose should be done; they do not know the area&#13;
targeted, nor its inhabitants, their aspirations or their social structure.&#13;
Participation of supposed beneficiaries at that stage is illusory, there is&#13;
no way to communicate with them, let alone to solicit their views, assuming&#13;
they can express them in a way understandable and, thus, useful to those who&#13;
design  the  project.  Thus,  project  design  really  revolves   around  some&#13;
macro-targets that everybody can agree upon, like kilometers of roads to be&#13;
built, numbers of schools to be constructed, man-months of extension to be&#13;
supplied,  etc.  And  even   those  overall  targets  are  based  on  doubtful&#13;
information  about   numbers  of  people,  living   and  working   conditions,&#13;
population distributions in the area, etc., since the information generally&#13;
available  from  such  sources   as,  for  instance,   the  Geological  Survey&#13;
Institutes or Agencies for Colonization and Agrarian Reform is at best&#13;
inadequate and at worst misleading. Available information most often is&#13;
related to properties, it does not tell about people living there, what they&#13;
do, their aspirations, etc. These data are insufficient and inadequate for&#13;
the design of a developmental process that will expand production and raise&#13;
incomes; they are even more insufficient to design "people development"&#13;
projects. Hence, under these conditions of fundamental uncertainty projects&#13;
cannot be designed with the rigor and the time-frames customary for the&#13;
design  of  technical  and  infrastructure  projects.  Observing  the   actual&#13;
development of IRD projects leads to the following specific observations:&#13;
130.       -   Dedicated and  well  motivated  project  staff realizes, at the&#13;
outset, that they do not know very much about the task at hand or about the&#13;
people they are supposed to work with. So they go out and try to learn.&#13;
Typically, teams of up to 10 project workers will spend at least a month&#13;
living and working among their target population, collecting sociological&#13;
information and beginning to build a bridge. between themselves and the rural&#13;
families. The information gathered during these initial exercises is used to&#13;
paint  a  true  sociological  picture  of   the  area  they   deal  with  and,&#13;
particularly, to identify possible associations or groups that either have a&#13;
natural cohesion or that could be formed. The importance of this way of&#13;
operation, is the implicit recognition that both project staff and supposed&#13;
beneficiaries have to get to know each other and have to establish mutual&#13;
respect. Although ultimately a certain measure of paternalism on the part of&#13;
project  staff is  inevitable,  and probably desirable,  the  essentially open&#13;
attitude   of  the   staff   fosters  a  natural,  relaxed  participation   of&#13;
beneficiaries in the project.&#13;
131.       -      Project staff  with empathy  towards its work and its  target&#13;
population  will  be able to bring the true  beneficiary participation  into a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
development  project, especially about how  )  things  should be done,  rather&#13;
than about what should be done. Given the almost universal deprivation in&#13;
most areas that are selected for integrated rural development, it is usually&#13;
quite obvious what can be done, i.e. anything generally labelled as improving&#13;
economic and social welfare. True participation of beneficiaries is to&#13;
generate realistic and popularly supported ways and means to do things, with&#13;
the help of the project but within its constraints.&#13;
132.       -   Human development  requires patience  and thus takes time, more&#13;
time than is generally allocated to technical projects with roughly similar&#13;
goals for physical achievements. The extra time required is needed to&#13;
organize the beneficiaries into participative groups, as well as to allow for&#13;
the learning process of the project staff. As indicated earlier, basic&#13;
information related to social and anthropological factors in most rural areas&#13;
is scant, and our operational methods for human development are vague. As a&#13;
consequence, much of the extra time required in rural development projects,&#13;
as compared with, for instance, construction projects is unfortunately at the&#13;
front  end  of  the project.  Ex 5ience appears to indicate that this initial&#13;
learning  and "conscientization"    phase, where few tangible achievements can&#13;
be expected, may last from two to four years, mostly depending upon the level&#13;
of community organization already existing in the project's area. However,&#13;
the almost universal use  of the discounted cash flow method  to  appraise the&#13;
financial viability  of  a project introduces  a strong bias  against projects&#13;
with  low  benefit streams  in  the early years, particularly since there is a&#13;
tendency to  plan for early disbursements,  i.e. to incur costs early, on  the&#13;
part of lending institutions. Under this method, human development projects,&#13;
just as reforestation projects, are just "not worth it". Limited initial&#13;
benefits thus typically frustrate both the traditional project designer as&#13;
well as the supervisor of project implementation, the latter by forcing him&#13;
to extend timetables of most rural development projects in order to reach&#13;
original goals, and the former by having to find a project design that&#13;
produces  early  benefits,  usually  in  the   form  of  expected   production&#13;
increases, the most easily quantifiable benefit. Other more intangible&#13;
benefits are then considered as "gravy&#13;
133.       -   Each  project   is   different;  its  mode  of  operation,  its&#13;
components  and its  timetable  should  all  be  tailored  to  the  particular&#13;
circumstances of the area targeted and of its inhabitants. Integrated rural&#13;
development, as a multi-component attack on poverty, is a useful concept, but&#13;
too general to be the panacea for overall rural underdevelopment. If we&#13;
accept that human development aims in essence at a change in basic attitudes,&#13;
the creation of an awareness among the population that they have to work&#13;
together toward common new goals, becomes a central part in each project and&#13;
has to be based on the existing reality of the project area. It will then&#13;
also be clear that many of the current, supposedly homogeneous, projects try&#13;
to cover too large an area with a blueprint approach. The inherent diversity&#13;
of conditions calls for a flexible approach by intelligent, dedicated and&#13;
motivated project personnel with authority to structure their work as they&#13;
see fit within their particular area. In this sense project staff are not&#13;
mere executors of a plan but are the creators and continuing supporters of an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
on-going process of change.&#13;
134.       -   Many  current projects  are  too large  for  available  project&#13;
staff to deal with effectively, particularly with respect to geographic areas&#13;
covered.  Also,  very  large  areas  tend  to  be  so  diverse   socially  and&#13;
economically that coverage with one project, and its set of components, does&#13;
not make much sense. An umbrella program covering a large number of smaller,&#13;
independent, projects is a better approach. This mode of operation and&#13;
managerial control is similar to the profit center concept of corporations.&#13;
Each   profit  center  has  a   fairly  large  degree  of  autonomy   and   of&#13;
responsibility for its own performance, as long as general company-wide&#13;
guidelines are obeyed. Similarly, each rural development project would have&#13;
substantial authority to decide its own destiny, within guidelines and&#13;
constraints of the overall IRD program. Of course, a large measure of local&#13;
authority does imply the necessity of strict and objective ex-post control of&#13;
expenditures and critical review of decisions made; i.e. periodic cost and&#13;
performance audits.&#13;
135.       -   In spite of  the  limited tangible  achievements to be expected&#13;
in the initial two to four year period of project evolvement, the staff will&#13;
need during this  period limited resources  t?5)take  some  immediate actions.&#13;
This ability to  get some modest achievements    is particularly important for&#13;
creating goodwill and an atmosphere of trust among the population with&#13;
respect to the project and its personnel. Also, it makes the project real and&#13;
tangible in the eyes of its beneficiaries from the start, i.e. from the time&#13;
traditionally spent on project design and evaluation. Urgent problems are&#13;
dealt with earlier, often yearslgtrlier, than is the case in a common IRD&#13;
project and  implementation cycle   . The  cost  of the formative stage of the&#13;
project is limited to the salaries and expenses of the staff plus outlays for&#13;
immediate actions. Experience in Brazil, best documented for a pilot project&#13;
in Natal, indicates that about 85% of the costs of the formative stage are&#13;
related to staff and their expenses while the remainder is spent on immediate&#13;
actions.&#13;
136.       -   Experience with  on-going IRD projects  shows that  preparation&#13;
has usually been done hurriedly, under pressure from a particular high&#13;
official or from an institution that saw an opportunity to obtain financing.&#13;
A long term programmatic approach would reduce this pressure on project&#13;
personnel and might lead to better, more careful and well founded projects.&#13;
In particular, beneficiary participation in project design is illusory when&#13;
design and appraisal personnel are under severe time pressures.&#13;
137.       -   There is little interaction  between  projects  even when  they&#13;
are  operating  fairly  close  to  each other  geographically.  Project  staff&#13;
generally has little or no opportunity to  learn from the experiences in other&#13;
projects  or to discuss their own  practices  and frustrations with colleagues&#13;
from elsewhere.  Cross  fertilization between projects in  a country  and even&#13;
between  projects  in   different  countries  would   be  beneficial   and   a&#13;
programmatic approach with an institution that covers a number of projects,&#13;
could  incorporate  easily  an  organized   substantial  interchange   between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
projects.&#13;
b.   General Approach&#13;
138.       National or regional  programs  should  be  set  up  to support and&#13;
guide the development of a number of fairly small and independent rural&#13;
development projects. The field projects proper should be allowed to develop&#13;
in two stages, a preparatory first stage and a major second, action oriented,&#13;
stage.&#13;
139.       The first  stage should be dedicated to a  learning  experience  of&#13;
the   project  staff  and  to   studying,  understanding  and  organizing  the&#13;
communities.  Project  management  should  have   modest  discretionary  funds&#13;
available to take immediate actions in instances where this is warranted and&#13;
where it will serve, for instance, to bring a community together. Funding for&#13;
this first stage should be limited to the cost of the personnel and its&#13;
operations, plus an immediate action fund. Project staff should be drawn, on&#13;
a long term basis, from various sectoral agencies such as the Health and&#13;
Agriculture Ministries, so as to insure an early integration of various types&#13;
of efforts and to bring, from the start broad based expertise into the field.&#13;
This expertise should be related to both production and social issues. In&#13;
order to maintain the appropriate authority and discipline it is necessary to&#13;
transfer all personnel to the payroll of the project. This creates a certain&#13;
distance between the sectoral agencies where the personnel originates and&#13;
their employment in the integrated rural development project. It should be&#13;
expected that the first, formative stage of the project may last from 2 to 4&#13;
years. Also, it should be expected that some projects may not be successful,&#13;
for a variety of reasons, and will therefore not proceed to the second stage&#13;
of substantial physical achievements.&#13;
139.       Once the  project area, and its inhabitants  are well understood by&#13;
the project staff and the communities begin to generate their demands, a&#13;
detailed  plan  for the  construction of physical  infrastructure and  for the&#13;
supply of technical and social services can be drawn up. This plan now can be&#13;
a project document, similar in form but more reliable in substance than&#13;
current project evaluation cum implementation reports. Still, in the spirit&#13;
of letting these projects grow organically only overall targets should be&#13;
set, even for the second phase. It should not be attempted to specify in&#13;
detail where and when everything should go. The combined targets, or the sum&#13;
of all the components, should be a basket of works and services available to&#13;
the project staff for use during implementation. This delegation of spending&#13;
authority to the field level will require formal scrutiny of expenditures in&#13;
order to avoid misuse and clear misallocation of funds. A standard accounting&#13;
system, independently verified periodically, should fulfill this requirement.&#13;
Timing and locale of implementation of any one component should be reported&#13;
in yearly or half-yearly implementation plans. In other words, implementation&#13;
should be geared to the development of the communities of beneficiaries and&#13;
to the extent and timing of their readiness to use the works services&#13;
productively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
140.       Project supervision  should  have  two main  components, evaluation&#13;
and auditing. Both should be done frequently, half-yearly or at least yearly.&#13;
The latter (auditing) should be an objective and independent scrutiny of the&#13;
expenses incurred by the project. Evaluation should be related to conceptual&#13;
issues, to judgments made, and to the overall development of the project.&#13;
Hence, evaluation, to a large extent, should be seen as technical assistance&#13;
to the project staff, rather than as a supervisory function. Evaluation&#13;
should be done by personnel with substantial experience in similar projects&#13;
who can discuss problems and experiences of particular projects in the light&#13;
of their broad familiarity with this work. Project evaluation in this sense&#13;
would be more time consuming and should be more analytical than current&#13;
supervision work. An specialized evaluation and monitoring facility should be&#13;
part of the framework organization under the overall integrated rural&#13;
development program. This facility should report directly to the director of&#13;
the program and should be administratively independent of any other unit&#13;
under the program.&#13;
c.   Required Pre-conditions&#13;
141.       Since the proposed  programmatic approach, with its flexibility and&#13;
delegation of authority to  the field level,  is  somewhat  alien to the usual&#13;
rigid operations of hierarchical and centralized sectoral agencies, it is&#13;
worthwhile to list a number of pre-conditions to be fulfilled before such an&#13;
approach can realistically be suggested.&#13;
142.       -   First,  there  should  exist  a  serious  national  or regional&#13;
interest  in  establishing  a  rural  development  program.  This interest may&#13;
reside in a government agency, in a public office or in a person. The&#13;
interest often is created by examples elsewhere, by readings or visits, or is&#13;
induced from the outside. Important, though, is to have a strong political&#13;
commitment that transcends the confines of any sectoral agency.&#13;
143.       -   Governments and supporting agencies should be  willing to relax&#13;
requirements  for  project  preparation,  in  exchange  for   assurances  that&#13;
dedicated multi-disciplinary project teams will be selected in an objective,&#13;
professional manner. This would include an effort to balance technical&#13;
expertise in project staffs with well qualified social and anthropological&#13;
expertise. Terms of reference should be drawn up carefully, but only as&#13;
concepts to guide the work and not as manuals to be followed blindly.&#13;
Remuneration and job security should be sufficiently attractive to interest&#13;
the above average young university graduate. In other words, stringent&#13;
project preparation by outsiders should be substituted by careful selection&#13;
of national teams which would be insiders, who  will have more1littitude to use&#13;
their own judgment in developing and implementing the project.&#13;
144.       -   Governments  should  commit themselves  to make  the  necessary&#13;
administrative arrangements guaranteeing that essential features of the&#13;
approach are preserved. This includes in particular long term delegation of&#13;
staff from specialized agencies to the project and granting financial&#13;
independence to the individual project (including payment of delegated staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
through the project).&#13;
145.       -   Governments  should accept independent  auditing  of  projects.&#13;
This  pre-condition  is   based  on  the   recognition   that  the   advocated&#13;
de-centralized approach avoids some of the administrative control mechanisms&#13;
inherent  in  centralized  bureaucracies  to   an  extent  l\at  unscrupulous&#13;
manipulators  could take advantage  of local  opportunities   . Control should&#13;
be imposed, but should be commensurate with the spirit of independence, trust&#13;
and local authority that is embedded in the concept of a decentralized&#13;
programmatic  approach.   Thus,  control  should  be  independent,   fair  and&#13;
reasonable, but must include the ability and authority for quick and drastic&#13;
action if deemed necessary.&#13;
146.       -   Projects  should   receive  a  grace  period  with  respect  to&#13;
tangible achievements. This relates in particular to expectations of early&#13;
benefit streams needed to show a viable project based on discounted benefit&#13;
flow analyses. Efforts should be made to quantify, or otherwise to take into&#13;
consideration those early benefits, that we now call intangible. Among those&#13;
are: community organizations, sense of belonging to a nation, some hope for&#13;
the  future  where  none  existed before,  increased  knowledge  and thus mÂ§&#13;
bargaining strength and leverage in both job and product markets, etc.&#13;
Another possibility would be to finance the extended preparation stage&#13;
through preinvestment or project preparation facilities and begin proper&#13;
project financing only with the second stage when measurable benefits can be&#13;
expected after a shorter period.&#13;
d.   A Suggested Sequence of Events&#13;
147.       It  appears best to describe a  potential IRD program as a sequence&#13;
of events, with the types of actions that should be taken  place  at each step&#13;
of its development.&#13;
148.       -   Early in the institutionalization  of  the  interest in  an IRD&#13;
program it  is  important to assign  overall responsibility for the  start and&#13;
development of a program to an agency that is independent from the rural&#13;
sectoral institutions of the public sector. This agency must have the&#13;
authority to enlist and coordinate the assistance of the various ministries&#13;
and other institutions since none of the latter has a mandate over any other&#13;
similarly positioned institution and hence will always lack the authority for&#13;
effective   coordination.  The   National  Planning  Office,  coordinator   of&#13;
Colombia's integrated rural development program is a good example of a&#13;
non-sectoral agency with the appropriate authority to lead an IRD program.&#13;
149.       -   Experience  shows  that success  or failure of  most  ventures,&#13;
undertakings or institutions in Latin America depend to a large degree upon&#13;
the person leading it. Charismatic and motivated leadership is behind most&#13;
successes; faceless and nameless leadership by groups, e.g. through boards of&#13;
directors or committees, is much rarer in Latin America than it is, for&#13;
instance, in Northern Europe or the United States. Thus, we would put much&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -    I&#13;
emphasis on finding and nominating the right director for an IRD program.&#13;
Once the right person has been found, he or she can be relied upon to select&#13;
and hire a trusted and dedicated core team. This core team would be&#13;
multi-disciplinary, i.e. would include technicians such as agricultural&#13;
production   and  extension   specialists  as   well   as   sociologists   and&#13;
anthropologists. The total initial team would probably number less than ten.&#13;
150.       -   The right  director,  by  virtue  of being  called  the  "right&#13;
person" will probably not accept the job without commensurate authority.&#13;
Nevertheless,  it  may  be  worthwhile  to  emphasize  that  an   IRD  program&#13;
directorate, in order to be able to be effective, will need a large measure&#13;
of financial independence and budgetary control. In other words, the IRD&#13;
program directorate should have the purse strings of its own operations. Much&#13;
of the authority needed to enlist the cooperation of various public sector&#13;
agencies emanates from the ability to underwrite part of their budgets. Thus,&#13;
the next step would be the administrative action necessary to effect these&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
151.       -   If one deals with a new program in a new  region, to be run by,&#13;
as yet, irnexperienced people, a concentrated learning exercise is called for.&#13;
A seminar should be arranged for the core team of the program, including the&#13;
director, conducted by a number of people who are experienced with the&#13;
concept and with the various applications of IRD. This seminar should be&#13;
followed by field visits to selected projects, again by the entire core team.&#13;
152.       -   The  core  team,  guided by  its director, should now  draft  a&#13;
position paper with their elaboration of the IRD concept, and its objectives,&#13;
as applicable to the particular reality of the area or region they'deal with.&#13;
This paper should be followed by an operational plan that should include&#13;
guidelines and time schedules, if applicable, for the following&#13;
i)   sources and selection criteria for field personnel;&#13;
ii)   selection  criteria for areas that might  be considered for nucleus&#13;
projects. This part of the operational plan will probably include&#13;
preliminary choices of a number of areas. Areas should not be&#13;
larger than what can be covered by a team. Their size will thus&#13;
depend on the type of agriculture employed, population density,&#13;
topography, extent of road network, type and extent of community&#13;
organization, and the expected required intensity and frequency of&#13;
contact with individuals or groups of beneficiaries.&#13;
iii)   terms of reference  for the  field  teams that eventually  will run&#13;
the nucleus projects. Although largely conceptual in nature, these&#13;
terms  of reference should be  used  for  some  operational  target&#13;
setting as, for instance, the type of information sought in the&#13;
initial social survey, the number of families expected to be&#13;
visited daily or weekly by the respective team members, maximum&#13;
time to be dedicated to various tasks, etc. Although the terms of&#13;
reference  for  the  field   teams  should  leave  ample  room  for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
initiative, the inherent flexibility should not be usable as an&#13;
easy excuse for underperformance on the part of program personnel.&#13;
In particular, maximum amounts of time allowed, and deadlines,&#13;
should be set for the various tasks.&#13;
iv)   detailed   budgeting   of  all  operations,  including  funds   for&#13;
immediate actions.&#13;
153.       -   While the  previous task is being conducted,  the  selection of&#13;
field  personnel  can  be   started.   Again,  some  intensive  training   and&#13;
familiarization with the concept of IRD is called for. In this case, a&#13;
training course or seminar should be conducted by experienced field personnel&#13;
from  other  projects, preferably  from within26e same  country.  The courses&#13;
conducted by  the Ecuadorian organization CESA    are  a good example  of  the&#13;
practical teaching cum training needed.&#13;
154.       -   With a  new program,  the number of initial field teams will be&#13;
quite small. The number of potential areas for nucleus projects will exceed&#13;
the number of teams available. Thus, selections of teams and assignments to&#13;
areas will have to be made. It is in the spirit of the program's organization&#13;
to let the teams have a voice in the ultimate selection of the particular&#13;
area they will work in. A team should probably be sent on a preliminary&#13;
reconnaissance mission of one week to each of, let's say, four different&#13;
areas. Upon return they should decide, together with the program's core team&#13;
which of the areas they should work in.&#13;
155.       -   An  area  team will probably  need  a  month or so to establish&#13;
themselves in their area before they can start the sociological survey.&#13;
156.       From here on,  the sequence of events  becomes, of necessity,  much&#13;
vaguer. It is  now  up to  the  individual field teams  to develop their  work&#13;
within the reality of the situation in their area and within the confines of&#13;
the team's own resources and capabilities. It is likely that development&#13;
plans, specific achievements and schedules of operations will be different&#13;
between different projects under the same overall program. Three generally&#13;
applicable comments, though, can be made. First, the teams should receive&#13;
periodic visits by knowledgeable outsiders, preferably from international&#13;
support  agencies,  to  supervise  their   protiss  and  to   give  technical&#13;
assistance  with respect to conceptual issues.    Second, a methodology and an&#13;
organizational  framework  should   be  established  for  the  interchange  of&#13;
experience between teams in different areas. And third, the initial formative&#13;
stage of a project, may last anywhere between 2 to 4 years. In this stage not&#13;
much tangible progress should be expected apart from modest "immediate&#13;
actions". However, the end of this stage should be considered to be reached,&#13;
when it becomes possible to prepare a firm project proposal of production,&#13;
social and infrastructure services and works to be delivered within a period&#13;
of not more than the next five years. The project proposal should be a report&#13;
with substance, done by insiders familiar with the real situation in their&#13;
area, and with implicit and explicit contributions by the target population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
157.       -   The second phase of the project should then be similar to  what&#13;
currently is called an integrated rural development project. However, the&#13;
particular projects under a program should be smaller than the average&#13;
current projects, in order to have operational units that are as nearly as&#13;
possible economically and socially homogeneous. This, in order for project&#13;
staff to deal effectively with the target population and its concerns. As a&#13;
consequence, more diversity among projects should be expected, because&#13;
projects will be more custom tailored and less following a blueprint.&#13;
158.       How this  sequence  of  events  will  be  put  into  practice,  and&#13;
particularly at which point it will be actually entered, depends on the&#13;
extent of existing rural development efforts in the particular locale or&#13;
situation. For instance, many areas in the Northeastern part of Brazil have&#13;
so far been untouched by systematic rural development efforts. In most of the&#13;
area, community organization is rudimentary or non-existent. Thus, one would&#13;
expect local projects, as part of a regional program, to start at the very&#13;
beginning of the sequence described here. On the other hand, another project&#13;
let's say in Minas Gerais would build on substantial experience, gained over&#13;
many years, with at least two large scale programs. Further rural development&#13;
projects, using local expertise, would probably start, at the very least,&#13;
with experienced field teams. Colombia had about twenty small scale pilot&#13;
projects gradually developed over a 5 year period, run by an institution&#13;
under  the  Ministry  of   Agriculture,  before  a  nationwide   program  with&#13;
independent nucleus projects was undertaken. The nationwide program, thus,&#13;
was able to start with a core of experienced personnel and with an inventory&#13;
of specially developed technical assistance.&#13;
2.    Co-ventures between Private and Public Sector&#13;
for New Settlements&#13;
159.       The  suggestion  of possible  synergism  in  rural  development  if&#13;
private and public sector initiatives are combined, is based on observations&#13;
and experiences in Brazil and in Ecuador. Both countries have a history of&#13;
successful private land development and settlement. Until very recently,&#13;
Brazilian  experiences   with  colonizations  and  settlement  projects   have&#13;
remained purely private sector undertakings; early spontaneous colonizijjons&#13;
in  Ecuador have  been supported later with various government  actions.    It&#13;
should be noted, though, that what is proposed here should properly be called&#13;
support for settlement schemes rather than for colonization. The latter&#13;
refers to extensive intervention in new virgin territory where otherwise&#13;
development would not, or not yet, take place. The type of settlement&#13;
projects advocated here imply a more marginal type of intervention in current&#13;
frontier lands where development is, or will be, spreading anyway. It is&#13;
these settlement projects on frontier lands which offer scope for combined&#13;
private and public sector ventures. Although Brazil springs to mind as the&#13;
Latin American country presently most active in opening up frontier lands,&#13;
others  offer  similar  opportunities:  the   low   land   areas  of  Bolivia,&#13;
particularly around Santa Cruz; the area between Tingo Maria and Pucailpa in&#13;
Peru; frontier lands on the Paraguay side of the Paraguay river; or the&#13;
Oriente of Colombia. What is proposed here, at least as far as type of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
project is concerned, is a variation upon current rurf)development projects,&#13;
rather  than a radical departure. As noted  by Tendler   ,  there are striking&#13;
similarities in concept between the type of rural settlement projects&#13;
suggested  here and new style urban projects. She goes so far as to call these&#13;
settlement projects : "rural sites and services" projects.&#13;
a.   Arguments and Ideas&#13;
160.       The arguments for  the suggestion  of  joint  private-public sector&#13;
settlement or colonization projects are related both to the nature of these&#13;
projects (settlement schemes) and to the type of implementing agency, a&#13;
private land developing company.&#13;
161.       -   Some  private development schemes have been very successful  in&#13;
providing land and opportunity for large numbers of small and medium scale&#13;
farmers. As was shown in the last chapter, one of the most successful of&#13;
these private companies, and for a long time Brazil's largest private land&#13;
developer, the Companhia Melhoramentos Norte do Parana (CMNP) has developed&#13;
over 1.3 million  hectares of  virgin land, founded six  major  cities  and 57&#13;
minor ones, sold approximately  50,000  farm properties, with an average  size&#13;
of  about 30 hectares, ranging from  12 to  73 hectares, to small farmers, and&#13;
sold over 75,000 urban residential plots. The total population of the&#13;
company's area with a size somewhat larger than the state of Connecticut, is&#13;
now several million.&#13;
162.       -   There  are frontier areas in  several Latin  American countries&#13;
where similar long term settlement schemes could be developed. However, some&#13;
of  the  better  lands  available  are  marginally  unattractive  to   private&#13;
companies, because of complications such as confusion about ownership,&#13;
institutional  problems  and  political  interference.   A  partnership   with&#13;
government might alleviate these complications sufficiently to make the&#13;
development attractive to private initiative. The CNNP, mentioned in the&#13;
previous paragraph, appears to be in just this situation. Some years ago,&#13;
this company tried to acquire a large tract of frontier land in the state of&#13;
Matto Grosso. The purchase was not affected, however, because of ownership&#13;
complications and of, what was called, unwarranted political interference&#13;
from the Matto Grosso state government.&#13;
163.       -   Directed settlement  projects  in  remote frontier  lands  have&#13;
some of  the  advantages  of  urban projectI45hat are  often  absent  in  more&#13;
traditional   rural   development  projects   . Among   those  are:   phy,sical&#13;
separation from areas under, what Tendler calls, elite control, and hence&#13;
less unwarranted influence by powerful groups; benefits of infrastructure&#13;
development can be focused clearly on the poor; and the project's building&#13;
agency can provide employment.&#13;
164.       -   A  private  managing  partner  can provide the  continuity  and&#13;
stability  that  is  mostly  difficult  to  find  in  public  sector agencies.&#13;
Frequent personnel turnover, which is a notorious problem of many IRD&#13;
projects can be avoided. The  CMNP  , for example, has a managing director who&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
joined the Company in 1932. In 1975, the Company had 22 senior personnel with&#13;
more than 30 years of service.&#13;
165.       -   The  operational  philosophy  of  a  private  land  development&#13;
company is deceptively simple, based as it is on a single motive, profit.&#13;
Instead of trying to combine a number of different and unrelated development&#13;
objectives and thus being forced into compromises and committee solutions, as&#13;
is usually the case in public sector projects, a private developer will&#13;
select the area with highest potential for successful development and will&#13;
seek to eliminate bottlenecks. The private land development companies in&#13;
Brazil have selected, and still select, areas of high potential as e.g. the&#13;
coffee growing areas on terra roxa in Parand and, today, rubber and cacao&#13;
growing areas in Matto Grosso. The private developer focuses clearly on the&#13;
main issues. CMNP, for example, spent the first years of its efforts clearing&#13;
title to the land, often paying off several holders of dubious claims. This&#13;
is  a  critical   step,  as   land  tenure  for  smallholders,  the   intended&#13;
beneficiaries of these settlement schemes, is most precarious in Brazil. On&#13;
the basis of secure land titles the company, in the 1930's and 1940's offered&#13;
mortgages  at terms 415  were better than those ever  offered to smallholders&#13;
in  Brazil's history.    In  order to  create markets  for  the small farmer's&#13;
production  and to have  a ready source of production  inputs  and consumption&#13;
articles, the company planned and built towns at 15 Kms. intervals along the&#13;
main penetration roads. Thus, parallel rural and urban development was part&#13;
of the overall plan from the start. The basic development strategy of this&#13;
company clearly focused on the rural poor. According to CMNP's managing&#13;
director, about 50% of the ultimate purchasers of properties started in the&#13;
area as rural laborers, saving enough to be able to buy their own property&#13;
eventually. All this, and more, was done by a company whose guiding&#13;
motivation was to make a profit through the sale of land.&#13;
166.       -   The proposed mode of  implementation of the settlement projects&#13;
appears to be  almost  diametrically opposed to the  way  in which current IRD&#13;
projects are realized. In essence, these settlement projects pay their own&#13;
way. Each increment is financed with the surplus of returns of the previous&#13;
phase. Of course, there is an initial outlay of funds to purchase the basis&#13;
for development, the land. But, contrary to the practice in public sector&#13;
projects,  there  are  no   large  outlays   planned  up   front,  neither  in&#13;
infrastructure nor in social services. This practice, incidentally, must&#13;
alleviate some of the bias built into current IRD projects, where discounted&#13;
benefit considerations force the search for, and incorporation of, means to&#13;
generate early benefits in order to off-set high early costs.&#13;
167.       -   Public sector  services, particularly  extension, in settlement&#13;
projects on frontier lands have an entirely new clientdle. There are no&#13;
established large landholders. Hence the common problem in other rural&#13;
development projects, where the extension service has to be re-directed&#13;
towards the small farmers, does not apply. Also, successful extension work&#13;
means successful farmers, which in turn helps land sales. This promotes&#13;
practical, result-oriented extension work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
168.       -   Although  an organized  public  sector  and its  services  came&#13;
fairly early to most parts of private settlements, largely through the early&#13;
incorporation of municipalities and the attendant tax revenues, long term&#13;
developments appear to have been influenced negatively by the weakness of the&#13;
public sector and its institutions. For instance, the requirement to leave at&#13;
least 10% of each holding under its original vegetative cover, as a means to&#13;
combat erosion, was never enforced in Brazil. An alert extension service&#13;
might have prevented the gradual impoverishment of the land through over&#13;
exploitation and virtual absence of measures to maintain and restore soil&#13;
fertility.&#13;
b.    General Approach&#13;
169.       In  recognition  of  the  apparent success of  private  development&#13;
schemes, at least in the short to medium term, and in an attempt to alleviate&#13;
some of its constraints, the following might be an effective approach :&#13;
170.       -   Organize  large  settlement projects  on  frontier  lands  with&#13;
expected implementation periods of thirty years or more. The development&#13;
entity should be a partnership between a reputable and experienced private&#13;
land development company and the government. Day-to-day management should be&#13;
in the hands of the private partner. The role of the public sector partner&#13;
should be two fold: to bring public sector services to places and at levels&#13;
pre-determined in a master plan of development and, second, to support&#13;
financially some of the prospective settlers. The way in which the public&#13;
partner's role should be exercised in conceptualization and management, its&#13;
responsibilities with respect to timely delivery of services, and the extent&#13;
and   manner  of  support  for  some   settlers,  should  be  the  subject  of&#13;
negotiations between the private and public partner.&#13;
C.    Required Pre-conditions&#13;
171.       The following  listing  of pre-conditions  is  intended to indicate&#13;
what might be done to alleviate the usual and mutual distrust between the&#13;
private  and public sector  before  a project as  the  one  suggested could be&#13;
undertaken.  Also,  some  of   the  pre-conditions  are  meant   to  establish&#13;
responsibilities clearly and a priori; to try and bridge the gap created by&#13;
the inherent political discontinuity of the public sector; and to suggest a&#13;
mediator to bring the parties together. All this is suggested with the&#13;
conviction that the time appears to be right, i.e. the political conditions&#13;
are favorable in many parts of Latin America for joint private/public sector&#13;
rural development projects.&#13;
172.       -   Suitable  land  should  be  available,  i.e.  large  tracts  of&#13;
frontier land, with good soil and climate, with known and favorable growing&#13;
conditions for stable and remunerative cash crops and with unambiguously&#13;
identifiable title. Although its location will be at the margin of current&#13;
developments, the area should have easy access to markets for its main cash&#13;
crop(s).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
173.       -   The  private  partner should be selected for his experience and&#13;
reputation as a developer. It should be a company of substance, i.e. the&#13;
company should be able to undertake the envisioned development on its own, if&#13;
expertise and financial strength were the only criteria.&#13;
174.       -   Of  crucial importance is  the selection, by the government, of&#13;
the  right  executing  agency  for  the   public  sector's  role.  Taking  the&#13;
experiences with integrated rural development projects as a guide we would&#13;
suggest that a non-sectoral agency be selected, an agency with a staff&#13;
function, not a line function. It should be an institution with sufficient&#13;
authority to command the respect of, and to effect the coordination among&#13;
various sectoral agencies. Furthermore, it should be a well established and&#13;
stable   agency,   not  subject  to  drastic  changes  with  each  change   of&#13;
administration. This is of particular relevance given the expected longevity&#13;
of the type of settlement projects advocated here. Another possibility would&#13;
be a large, well managed public development bank, whether agricultural or&#13;
not.&#13;
175.       -   It  may  be useful  to  bring  in  a third  party mediator,  or&#13;
"matchmaker",  to facilitate the  negotiations between the private  and public&#13;
partners. This may be particularly relevant for the first projects when the&#13;
impact of mutual distrust is still large and when the developmental concept&#13;
and respective positions of the partners are ill defined. An international&#13;
lending institution like the World Bank would appear to be an appropriate&#13;
candidate for this mediation role, probably enjoying the trust and confidence&#13;
of both parties to the project and having substantial experience, in its own&#13;
right, with agricultural and rural development.&#13;
176.       -   Finally,  the  joint design of a master plan  is  probably  the&#13;
last step in the preparatory process, prior to work on the project proper.&#13;
This master plan should be based on a firm understanding of the respective&#13;
roles of the partners. It should contain an elaboration of the concept upon&#13;
which the project is based, i.e. with respect to types of settlers, products&#13;
to be produced, expected speed of development, etc., and it should include&#13;
plans for physical accomplishments.&#13;
d.    Sequence of Events&#13;
177.       Not much  can be suggested  at this point about how to proceed with&#13;
the  idea  of   a  joint  private/public   sector   settlement  project.  Much&#13;
uncertainty  is  attached  to  the   initial  phases  of  planting  the  idea,&#13;
generating interest in the appropriate quarters in both the private and&#13;
public sector and trying to mediate and negotiate a long term relationship.&#13;
Given the uncertainty a private investor faces and the reluctance of many&#13;
Latin American governments to work closely with private companies in projects&#13;
with great political appeal, an outside third party would probably be the&#13;
best catalyst for such ventures. International lending institutions would be&#13;
in a good position to promote such a project as the promise of finance would&#13;
encourage the government to overcome its political scruples while the private&#13;
sector would feel secure against politically motivated arbitrary interference&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
with an international institution involved.&#13;
3.    Programs to Support Non-Governmental Organizations&#13;
178.       Most  countries  in  Latin   America   have  a  large   number   of&#13;
non-Governmental organizations that are  engaged in  various aspects  of rural&#13;
development.  It is gradually recognized that NGOs can increase  the scope  of&#13;
development efforts  and as such can be  considered important partners2gyr the&#13;
elaboration,  design   and  implementation  of  development  projects.            For&#13;
instance, between 1975 and 1982, a total of 46 different NGOs were involved&#13;
with various aspects of 75 World Bank financed projects. Of the 75 projects,&#13;
30 were in agriculture and 4 were in rural electrification. In 25% of the&#13;
cases of NGO involvement with World Bank funded projects, the NGO was a&#13;
contractor; in an equal number of cases the NGO was the recipient of a loan&#13;
or a grant from the government out of the proceeds of the Bank loan. In spite&#13;
of this increased recognition of the potential contribution by NGOs, there is&#13;
much controversy about the effectiveness of these organizations, mostly&#13;
because of their  limited size and scope of work.  The  c ims of success made&#13;
by  the  organizations themselves  are often  questioned.          What Tendler has&#13;
called   the   "the  articles   of   faith",  refer   to  common   themes   of&#13;
self-descriptions of non-governmental agencies, including claims that these&#13;
organizations reach the poorest better than public sector bureaucracies;  that&#13;
they are better in generating real beneficiary participation; that they are&#13;
good in engendering the process of  change in society; that they are better in&#13;
working directly with the people in the field; that they are more flexible&#13;
and innovative in their methods of operation and, finally, that they have a&#13;
special ability to work with and strengthen local private institutions.&#13;
Although   some,  if  not  most,   of  these  claims   may   be   exaggerated,&#13;
non-governmental  organizations  probably  are  an   important  under-utilized&#13;
resource for rural development in many countries. Given the limited coverage&#13;
achieved by most of the rural development efforts of the public sector, there&#13;
appears  to  be  a  strong  justification   to  use  any  additional  resource&#13;
available, in spite of its limitations and some reservations about its&#13;
effectiveness.  This is beg Wing to be  recognized in several countries.  For&#13;
instance  in Ecuador, SEDRI    is in the process  of establishing a program to&#13;
support the many non-governmental agencies engaged in rural development work&#13;
in Ecuador with managerial and technical assistance.&#13;
179.       Often, non-governmental  agencies,  the  majority  of whose workers&#13;
are motivated by a strong social conscience, come under attack for policies&#13;
that displease the government. Frequent attacks on non-governmental agencies&#13;
by more traditionally inclined governments in Latin America have led to a&#13;
certain paranoia among those agencies in a number of countries. This is true&#13;
particularly in Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay. It is true that little is&#13;
known publicly about the activities of non-governmental agencies in those&#13;
countries and that it often is even difficult to contact them. On the other&#13;
hand, the limited evidence available, and experience in the field, suggest&#13;
that a more systematic use of, and support for the activities of non-public&#13;
sector institutions working in the rural areas could be quite productive. Two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
examples of pragmatic and successful p5Â¢jate initiatives in their own right&#13;
are CESA in Ecuador and DESEC in Bolivia.&#13;
a.    Justifications&#13;
180.        The  positive attributes of non-governmental organizations probably&#13;
outweigh substantially their limitations and ineffectiveness for certain&#13;
tasks. Among the apparent arguments for organized and systematic public&#13;
sector   support   for  non-governmental  organizations   engaged   in   rural&#13;
development are the following :&#13;
-     Non-governmental organizations appear to be  able to  attract&#13;
well motivated, socially conscious staff willing and able to&#13;
live in remote areas for long periods of time among the&#13;
population they work with. One of the reasons why NGOs&#13;
appear  to  be  able  to   attract  unusually  dedicated  and&#13;
motivated  staff  are  their  main   recruitment  criteria  :&#13;
attitude towards and aptitude for the work to be done. NGOs&#13;
tend to recruit their staff on the basis of a consideration&#13;
of their professional capabilities, but often and more&#13;
importantly,  on  the  basis of  their  perceived  commitment&#13;
towards  the   particular  goals   of  the   organization  in&#13;
question. This contrasts with the usual hiring practice of&#13;
government institutions where more objective criteria of&#13;
professional   qualifications,  curriculum  vitae  and  other&#13;
technical considerations have to be taken into account,&#13;
rather than attitudes of commitment to particular sectors of&#13;
the population or particular policies.&#13;
-     Non-governmental organizations can be  a good vehicle for the&#13;
dynamic and charismatic person who has drive and ambition to&#13;
do rural development work as he, or she, sees fit. As a&#13;
matter of fact, most of the successful organizations that we&#13;
are familiar with were started by one person with a vision.&#13;
Often, part of the drive and dedication of the staff,&#13;
alluded to earlier, is based upon their respect for and&#13;
belief in the founder and director of the institution.&#13;
Many NGOs  show  a method of  operation  that  was  advocated&#13;
previously as part of a different approach to public sector&#13;
IRD projects, i.e. the willingness to allow for an initial,&#13;
mutual, learning and familiarization period for both project&#13;
workers and beneficiaries.&#13;
In  spite of  the  origins of many  NGOs as relief  agencies,&#13;
there  is  a  tendency  now  to   focus  more  on  production&#13;
increases, as  a  means  of  development,  in  line with  the&#13;
current   development   philosophy   of   the   large   donor&#13;
organizations. However, their old and continuing emphasis on&#13;
relief  makes  these  organizations   rather  appropriate  to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
conduct   the   social   components   of   integrated   rural&#13;
development projects.&#13;
There are indications that NGOs can  accomplish  a number  of&#13;
activities, particularly the construction of  infrastructure,&#13;
less expensively than the usual public sector institutions.&#13;
The main reasons appear to be first, that their personnel&#13;
works close enough to the beneficiaries and their local&#13;
organizations to be able to mobilize traditional communal&#13;
self help energies, and second, NGOs depend upon private&#13;
contractors rather than upon the executing agencies of the&#13;
public   sector  for  the   construction  of  such  works  as&#13;
irrigation canals and feeder roads.&#13;
Many  NGOs  still  try  to  do the new  type  of work,  rural&#13;
developent,  with  the  old  type  of  staff,  i.e.  with  an&#13;
idealistic staff of generalists. In many cases they need&#13;
extra  technical  assistance  in  order   to  do  their  work&#13;
efficiently.&#13;
There  is  often   no   dialogue   between   non-governmental&#13;
organizations and the sectoral institutions of the public&#13;
sector. This can seriously hamper the brokerage role that&#13;
non-governmental agencies could perform effectively between&#13;
the  rural   poor   and   public   sector   institutions.  An&#13;
authoritative support agency for NGOs might be able to&#13;
mediate some of the coordination problems encountered.&#13;
There   is  evidence   that,   as   in  most   organizations,&#13;
creativity, efficiency and hard work are related to newness&#13;
and youth. Accordingly, the promotion of the establishment&#13;
of more and new non-governmental agencies to work on one or&#13;
another aspect of rural development would appear to be in&#13;
the overall interest of that work. The existence of a&#13;
supporting agency might just be the "venture capital" that&#13;
is needed to get a number of these programs started.&#13;
Non-governmental agencies appear to be good  in bridging  the&#13;
gap between the small holder and the credit system. Because&#13;
of their closeness to the small farmer and the community,&#13;
non-governmental agencies and their personnel can often make&#13;
personal, subjective judgments about the credit worthiness&#13;
of a person or an association. This may open the way to&#13;
extend credit, not so much on the basis of collateral which&#13;
the small farmer often does not have, but on the basis of&#13;
knowledge and judgment of the person in question.&#13;
Non-governmental development agencies can remain  independent&#13;
of the governmental development policy of the day. Contrary&#13;
to the situation of government development agencies, NGO's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
policies  do  not   have   to  be  consistent  with   overall&#13;
government development policy. In other words, changes in&#13;
these policies at governmental level will not necessarily&#13;
affect the functioning of the NGO's development concepts or&#13;
of its concrete development projects. The developmental&#13;
policies of NGOs tend to be generated internally. Actually,&#13;
a certain developmental policy is often at the heart of the&#13;
creation and existence of many NGOs. At most, the NGOs&#13;
developmental policies will be adjusted in the face of&#13;
criticism and suggestions of the target population with&#13;
which the organization works and as a result of suggestions&#13;
and requests by co-financing agencies for certain projects&#13;
implemented by the NGO. Thus, the changes in policies of&#13;
NGOs   tend   to   be  more  project  specific,   while   the&#13;
organization as such tends to follow a rather steady policy&#13;
course.   Hence,  the   voluntary  nature  of  the   work  of&#13;
non-governmental organizations distinguishes them from the&#13;
compulsory   nature   of  the   activities   carried   on  by&#13;
governmental agencies, and there can be more continuity in&#13;
their developmental efforts.&#13;
In  contrast  with  government agencies,  who  will  have  to&#13;
strive  for  an  equitable  distribution  of   their  efforts&#13;
nation-wide, following fluctuations in national policies,&#13;
non-governmental organizations can be more parochial and can&#13;
direct their efforts to specific parts of the population or&#13;
to limited and well-defined areas of the country. As a&#13;
matter of fact, most NGOs have fairly clearly defined target&#13;
populations.&#13;
The  limited  size  of  NGOs,  which  admittedly  limits  the&#13;
absolute impact that most of them can have, also has its&#13;
advantages.  Because   of  the  limited  number   of   people&#13;
involved, and because an NGO does not have to cope with a&#13;
large bureaucracy, their decision making structure can be&#13;
rather simple and fast. For the same reason, their overhead&#13;
costs per dollar spent on actual project related activities&#13;
can be smaller than similar costs of larger governmental&#13;
institutions dealing with rural development. Hence, NGOs can&#13;
operate with lower budgets and with more agile and flexible&#13;
procedures    for   decision   making   than   their   larger&#13;
counterparts in the public sector bureaucracies.&#13;
Contrary  to government institutions,  NGOs  appear  to  have&#13;
greater  difficulties   in   financing  the  start  of  their&#13;
operations. However, once started, usually with financial&#13;
support from abroad, their financial situation tends to be&#13;
more   stable  than  the   situation  of   most  governmental&#13;
agencies. The latter usually have to deal every year with&#13;
national priorities in terms of budget composition and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
allocation of funds. NGOs have a certain guarantee of&#13;
operating with the financial support already conceded, often&#13;
for a fairly long period of time; at least as long as their&#13;
major projects last. Not only do government institutions&#13;
suffer from the yearly budget process of the government, but&#13;
they also tend to be, for very much the same reasons, under&#13;
pressure to show yearly results and particularly to spend&#13;
the  yearly   allocated  sums   of  money.   Non-governmental&#13;
organizations usually do not have this type of disbursement&#13;
pressure on them.&#13;
b.    General Approach&#13;
194.       The  term   non-governmental  organizations  covers  a  varied  and&#13;
somewhat confused universe of institutions, aiming at diverse goals, usually&#13;
different  from   those  of  institutions   in   the   public   sector.  These&#13;
organizations include those established by churches, by social clubs, by&#13;
universities,  research centers, or  political  parties,  by  craft  and union&#13;
organizations and by other private associations. For the purposes of this&#13;
report we will define the non-governmental organizations as those that are&#13;
private,   non-profit   and  dedicated   to   the   design,   evaluation   and&#13;
implementation of development projects and programs in rural areas. We&#13;
include only those organizations that are action oriented and focus on&#13;
developmental work rather than on relief.&#13;
195.       Mostly, these organizations  define  as  their target  groups those&#13;
sectors of the population that are known as poor or "marginalized", meaning&#13;
that their clientele is not integrated in society. Their declared goals and&#13;
specific activities often imply an intent to change the prevailing social&#13;
system. They tend to receive financial support from other entities and&#13;
institutions, usually from abroad, who are sympathetic with the particular&#13;
organizations' views of the society or with its intention to change the&#13;
social system. As such, many NGOs in Latin America, working on various&#13;
aspects of rural development, are supported by a multitude of European left&#13;
of   center   institutions.   Thus,  grass  roots  movements,   with   popular&#13;
participation, aiming at the political mobilization of the rural poor usually&#13;
receive support from national non-governmental organizations dealing with&#13;
rural development, who in turn receive international support from kindred&#13;
institutions.&#13;
196.       The  most  important  pre-condition  for  the  establishment  of  a&#13;
successful support program for non-governmental agencies appears to be the&#13;
acceptance at a high level in government, of the idea that NGOs are&#13;
potentially  effective.  This   acceptance   should   go  together   with   an&#13;
understanding of the workings, of the limitations and of the aspirations of&#13;
these institutions among the top decision making level in the government.&#13;
197.       Methods   of   cooperation   have   to   be   established   between&#13;
non-governmental agencies and their counterparts in the public sector.&#13;
Competition between governmental and non-governmental organizations often&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
arises as a result of professional jealousy or because of competition for the&#13;
interests and support of the same target groups. Suspicions on the part of&#13;
governmental institutions that NGOs are against the establishment or against&#13;
the development policies stated by governmental institutions have to be&#13;
resolved.&#13;
198.       A  support  program  for non-governmental organizations, of  course&#13;
must remain evenhanded and has to prevent creating the impression that one&#13;
agency is favored over another.&#13;
c.    Possible Types of Support&#13;
199.       A national  or international support  program  for NGOs should have&#13;
three main objectives: render direct managerial and technical assistance;&#13;
facilitate cooperation between NGOs and pertinent sectoral agencies of the&#13;
government; and provide access to a pool of information about the state of&#13;
the art of activities in which the NGOs engage.&#13;
200.       Many NGOs are established  and run  by  professionals  who  have no&#13;
formal   training  in  the   managerial   or   organizational  aspects  of  an&#13;
institution. Often, these same professionals have little inclination to get&#13;
involved with what they consider matters of bureaucracy. Furthermore, the&#13;
increased emphasis on development, rather than on welfare, in the work of&#13;
many NGOs, has created demands for technical skills, such as agricultural&#13;
production expertise, that these organizations do not have. The availability&#13;
of topical expertise, that can be drawn on if and when required, in the form&#13;
of short term consulting assistance would be helpful to many NGOs.&#13;
201.       NGOs  often  are  in  a  good position  to bring  public  goods and&#13;
services, such as agricultural extension, health supply or education to&#13;
communities   that  are  so  far  untouched  by  the  relevant  public  sector&#13;
institutions. However, many reasons, from ignorance to jalousie de mdtier may&#13;
keep NGOs from bridging the gap between the government institutions and the&#13;
population groups with whom they are involved. Support for NGOs by an&#13;
international agency, trusted and respected by both the public sector and the&#13;
NGOs, could play an important mediation role between the two.&#13;
202.       Most  NGOs, and  particularly indigenous,  local  organizations, do&#13;
not have ready access to information about developments in their areas of&#13;
technical or social activity. Hence, a useful objective of a national support&#13;
system for NGOs would be to function as a "resource center for NGOs". This is&#13;
one activity of a local support organization that could benefit from&#13;
connections with external agencies, including internationally operating NGOs.&#13;
This  access   to  information   and   assistance   need  not  be  limited  to&#13;
technological  matters,  but  can  as  well   include  access   to  managerial&#13;
assistance, information about financing sources, etc.&#13;
203.       Finally, some modest  financial aid  for organized local support of&#13;
NGOs would probably contribute considerably to establish better cooperation&#13;
between NGOs and local public sector agencies.&#13;

6) Technically, the desire for quick results stems from the use of discounted&#13;
benefit analysis which puts an exceedingly high premium on time and hence&#13;
quick results. It is doubtful that any integrated rural development project&#13;
in a country with a high estimated discount rate could ever show a high&#13;
rate of return with discounted benefits.&#13;

8) The continuity of bureaucratic struggles is attested to by the current&#13;
desire, in some quarters in Colombia, to put the country's entire combined&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
integrated rural development and low cost food supply program under the&#13;
responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture. In our opinion that would be&#13;
a retrogression with respect to Colombia's history of integrated rural&#13;
development.&#13;

13)  For  instance,  where and how to  construct weirs in  rivers  to hold  water&#13;
during periods of drought, but such that they are not washed away in the&#13;
rainy season; organization of communual labor and the accounting of who&#13;
participated; how and on what to spend the funds contributed by community&#13;
members to communal cash accounts, etc.&#13;
14)  A  literal  translation  of the  Portuguese  word "concientizavao"  used  in&#13;
Brazil to describe part of the psychological "awakening" experienced by&#13;
project beneficiaries in the early stages of a successful IRD.&#13;
15) Modest achievements in our eyes may be not so modest in the eyes of a&#13;
deprived family of a small farmer.&#13;
16) An illustrative example of the importance of an immediate action program is&#13;
given in a publication describing the first, formative, stage of a project&#13;
in Ecuador now financed by the World Bank, and known as the Esmeraldas&#13;
project.&#13;

17) Personal experience with local field personnel in rural development in&#13;
Latin America has given us full confidence that intelligent, motivated and&#13;
dedicated young professionals can be found to form superb teams for rural&#13;
development action.&#13;
18)  In general graft and corruption tend to increase the  further one is removed&#13;
from the operational field level. Thus, the advocated de-centralization,&#13;
delegating authority downwards, might actually diminish the incidence of&#13;
abuse.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
19) The mayor of Nova Serrana, a municipality in an IRD area in Minas Gerais&#13;
(Brazil), cited as positive evidence of the beneficial impact of the&#13;
community organization under the project the fact that he now was able to&#13;
build a new road through the community of Ripas, in his municipality,&#13;
without having to pay indemnizations to all owners whose properties were&#13;
more   or  less   physically  influenced   by  the   construction.  Although&#13;
quantifiable in  this case, these and  similar side benefits are usually not&#13;
considered.&#13;
20) Central Educatoriana de Servicios Agricolas.&#13;
21) Outsiders and their institutions, with long term involvement in programs,&#13;
often also provide continuity of purpose in projects that have a rapid&#13;
turnover of personnel. The latter is unfortunately common among many public&#13;
sector agencies dealing with IRD. Furthermore, outsiders can often diminish&#13;
or eliminate unwanted influences, mostly political, that local personnel&#13;
finds difficult to oppose.&#13;
22) The best known example in Ecuador is the project in Santo Domingo de los&#13;
Colorados.&#13;

25) Farm lots were sold for 30% down, 10% the first year of occupation, 20Z for&#13;
the next 3 years. An interest rate of 8% was applied to the unpaid balance.&#13;
Urban lots were sold for 40% down and 30% in each of the ensuing two years.&#13;

            Integrated rural development in Latin America
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Integrated rural development projects
            have a number of functional components which are
            operationally unrelated. Agricultural production promoting
            activities such as the extension of credit are combined with
            social components such as the provision of health services
            and with infrastructure building works such as rural
            electrification. Although the concept of a multipronged
            approach to rural development appears sound and attractive
            to many, its actual application has in many instances been
            disappointing. In particular, concrete achievements and
            hence measurable benefits often fall short of planning
            goals. It is argued in this study that the modesty in
            achievements experienced, so far, is due as much to the
            complexity of the problem, rural underdevelopment, as it is
            to the result of structure and inexperience of the mostly
            public sector institutions that are asked to implement the
            project designs. Concluding that the concept of integrated
            rural development merits further application, the study
            recommends pursuing an institutionalization of project
            development activities, (2) enlisting private sector land
            development companies as executing agencies; and (3)
            supporting financially and with technical assistance the
            many nongovernmental agencies that operate in rural development.
