ANNEX 1: BACKGROUND AND DAMAGE ASSESSMENT&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    At 11.50 am on January 10, 1998 an earthquake of magnitude 6.2 on the Richter&#13;
scale occurred on impoverished rural areas on Bashang plateau in Zhangjiakou&#13;
Municipality. The epicenter was at the border of Zhangbei and Shangyi counties at&#13;
latitude 41.100 andL longitude 114.300. The earthquake was followed by a large number of&#13;
aftershocks, with a total of 481 being recorded in the week following the earthquake.&#13;
Fifteen of these measured over 4.0 on the Richter scale.&#13;
2.    Zhangjiakou Municipality consists of the Bashang plateau in the north, bordering&#13;
on Inner Mongolia, and the Baxia plain to the south. The total area of the municipality is&#13;
36,873 square kilometers (km2), containing a total population of 4.4 million. There are&#13;
four counties located on the Bashang plateau-Zhangbei, Guyuan, Kangbao and Shangyi,&#13;
with a total area of 12,480 km2. The altitude of the plateau varies from 1,300 to 1,600&#13;
meters (m) above sea level. The average annual temperature on the plateau is 2.6°C, and&#13;
the lowest recorded temperature is -34.8°C. The average length of the frost-free period is&#13;
110 days, with a minimum of 70 days. Water resources are scarce, with most of the&#13;
supply coming from wells. The area supports dryland agriculture, with limited areas of&#13;
irrigation using groundwater. Soil conditions are poor and the economic base is weak,&#13;
with per capita incomes of the order of Y 1,000 per year.&#13;
Damage Assessment&#13;
3.    There were 49 recorded deaths and 11,439 injuries. The earthquake caused&#13;
extensive damage over an area of some 2,600 km2 covering Zhangbei, Shangyi and&#13;
Kangbao counties on the plateau, and Wanquan county adjacent to the plateau. The&#13;
affected area includes 37 townships, 585 administrative villages and 1,824 other villages&#13;
with a population of 471,000. Of the above, 15 townships, 281 administrative villages&#13;
and 696 other villages, containing a total population of 241,000, were seriously affected.&#13;
Within these areas, the intensity of the earthquake was VIII measured on the modified&#13;
New China Intensity Scale (NCIS). A total of 136,000 rooms collapsed and a further&#13;
264,000 rooms were damaged, leaving a total population of 44,000 homeless.&#13;
4.    As was the case in the North China earthquake of October 1989 (North China&#13;
Earthquake Project-Credit 2091-CHA), which struck parts of Shaanxi and Hebei&#13;
Provinces, village housing suffered the most damage in the earthquake. Housing and&#13;
other village infrastructure in the affected areas are mainly local timber post and mud-&#13;
brick and stone construction that is vulnerable to earthquake shocks. Basic building&#13;
construction techniques have not always been incorporated into traditional building&#13;
practices. Bonding of corners, securing of gable walls, provision of lintels over openings,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-                       ANNEX 1&#13;
securing of roof structures, and the construction of the roof itself all too frequently have&#13;
structural weaknesses built into them.&#13;
5.    The earthquake has damaged the water supply to some 60,000 villagers in the&#13;
Zhangbei, Shangyi and Kangbao counties. Some 130 wells need rehabilitation (20&#13;
percent repair, 80 percent replacement), and pipelines will be extended to some 90&#13;
percent of the households with the remaining villagers relying on standpost supply. The&#13;
damage to water conservancy works in Zhangbei and Wanquan counties include&#13;
irrigation canals, office buildings and dormitories. Also, some 730 motor wells for&#13;
irrigation need repair/ reconstruction, mainly in Zhangbei and Shangyi counties. The&#13;
Friendship Reservoir, constructed in 1958, is the largest water storage facility in northern&#13;
Hebei Province. The dam, an earthfill structure of 40 m high and 290 m long, shows a&#13;
total of 27 cracks on the dam crest and slope failures occurred on both the upstream and&#13;
downstream dam faces. Additionally, the outlet tunnel and water intake tower were&#13;
damaged as well as part of the spillway channel and office buildings/dormitories.&#13;
6.    The total direct economic loss is estimated at Y 2.4 billion, of which rural housing&#13;
losses are estimated at Y 1.7 billion. The loss of economic and social facilities in the&#13;
severely affected townships and villages has wrecked the fragile local economy.&#13;
Although there is some local industry and mining, the local economy is primarily&#13;
agriculture-dependent. The villagers' barns, stables and grain storage facilities were&#13;
destroyed or damaged, resulting in stored winter food and animal feed being lost or&#13;
exposed to the elements. Schools, health centers, wells, irrigation channels, power lines,&#13;
and other infrastructure were also destroyed or damaged.&#13;
7.    China has recorded some of the most severe recorded earthquakes in the world.&#13;
Since 1900, there have been 664 earthquakes with magnitude over 6 on the Richter Scale&#13;
(RS), of which 107 registered over magnitude 7, or around 30 percent of world&#13;
earthquakes of that size. The most severe recent earthquake occurred in 1976, registering&#13;
7.8 on the Richter Scale, killing over 400,000 people, and substantially destroying the&#13;
city of Tangshan in Hebei Province, about five hours' journey by rail east of Beijing. The&#13;
death toll from earthquakes in China in the twentieth century exceeds 600,000,&#13;
accounting for over 50 percent of the world total. Chinese earthquake specialists have&#13;
predicted that, after a decade of relative calm, China is entering a period of high seismic&#13;
activity that is likely to last for 12 to 15 years.&#13;
Relief Operations&#13;
8.    Given that it was mid-winter and extremely cold in the earthquake area, the&#13;
central and local governments' immediate concerns were to provide adequate temporary&#13;
shelter, fuel, warm clothing and food supplies to the affected people. Governments,&#13;
supported by the People's Liberation Army (PLA), responded immediately by putting up&#13;
thermal tents, constructing temporary shelter, and treating, and evacuating where&#13;
necessary, the injured. Emergency relief supplies and donations were also received from&#13;
elsewhere in China and abroad. The relief effort was coordinated by a Leading Group&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -                      ANNEX 1&#13;
established at the level of Zhangjiakou Municipality (ZM), supported by the affected&#13;
counties' administration. Within one week of the earthquake a preliminary assessment of&#13;
the damage was made-a feat, given the widespread area that was affected and the bitter&#13;
cold of the plateau. The technical resources of the local governments were supplemented&#13;
by a provincial task force drawn from the architectural, engineering and town planning&#13;
institutes, and supported by experts from the Ministry of Communications (MOC) and&#13;
State Seismological Bureau (SSB).&#13;
Damage Mitigation&#13;
9.    The Tangshan earthquake resulted in a sweeping review of earthquake design&#13;
codes in China and in 1978 a revised antiseismic Building Design Code for Industrial and&#13;
Public Buildings was adopted. This code was followed by similar codes for water supply&#13;
and drainage works, gas and power/heating plants, hydraulic structures, railways,&#13;
highways and bridges. The effect of the new codes was evident in Zhangjiakou and in the&#13;
recent Inner Mongolia and Yunnan earthquakes as most of the recently constructed&#13;
buildings suffered only light damage or none at all. The Hebei Provincial Government&#13;
(HPG) confirmed that (a) all project-financed reconstructed works (except housing)&#13;
would be carried out to the latest antiseismic design codes; (b) designs would be to level&#13;
VIII on the modified New China Intensity Scale; and (c) in line with current practice, the&#13;
implementing agencies would be required to comply with the earthquake-expert team's&#13;
recommendations on whether buildings, or parts of buildings, would be demolished for&#13;
reconstruction or repaired.&#13;
10.   The Zhangjiakou Municipal and county governments will require the adoption&#13;
and use of cost-effective earthquake-resistant design and construction methods for&#13;
housing and other village infrastructure. Planning and design work will take place&#13;
through March, alfter which the ground conditions would be suitable for starting&#13;
reconstruction during the six months' construction window (April to September).&#13;
11.   China has a standardized procedure for classifying damage caused by earthquakes.&#13;
A team of experts is assembled by MOC and sent to investigate and classify the damage.&#13;
12.   The expert team categorizes structures as follows, taking into account the&#13;
structure's age, the type of structure, its suitability for repair, its depreciated value and&#13;
other factors such as its strategic importance (see Figure Al.1).&#13;
Level 1     No damage;&#13;
Level 2     Light damage-repairable;&#13;
Level 3     Medium  damage-repairable depending on age and type of&#13;
structure;&#13;
Level 4     Severe damage-irreparable, structure to be demolished; and&#13;
Level 5     Collapsed structure.&#13;

systems; and&#13;
* Institutional Development-$0.1 million: technical assistance, training and support&#13;
to Provincial, Municipal, County and Township level agencies, particularly for&#13;
building standard development, project management coordination, and monitoring.&#13;
Project Organization&#13;
2.    The Hebei Provincial Government (HPG) has established a Leading Group&#13;
chaired by the Deputy Party Secretary, whose members include directors from the&#13;
Planning Commission, the Finance Bureau and the Construction Commission. The Group&#13;
gives policy guidance on all matters relating to the earthquake emergency relief and&#13;
reconstruction effort, and will coordinate agency investments in the affected areas.&#13;
3.    The Provincial Government's existing Provincial Project Management Office&#13;
(PMO), which is responsible for all World Bank Group-financed projects in the Province,&#13;
would also be responsible for this emergency project. The PMO is chaired by the Vice&#13;
Director of the Hebei Provincial Finance Bureau (HFB). The functions of the PMO are&#13;
the coordination and monitoring of project preparation and implementation, collection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-                       ANNEX2&#13;
and analysis of project expenditures, and consolidation of information for the purposes of&#13;
reporting progress to HPG, and to the Bank Group. It will perform the same functions for&#13;
this project. The PMO also has the responsibility of managing the Special Account of this&#13;
IDA credit. The PMO has the responsibility to review the statements of expenditure&#13;
(SOEs) submitted by the Zhangjiakou Leading Group Project Office and submit the&#13;
withdrawal application to the IDA for replenishment.&#13;
4.    The Zhangjiakou Municipal Government (ZMG) has established a Municipal&#13;
Leading Group (MLG) chaired by the Vice Mayor. The members of the MLG include&#13;
directors or vice directors of Finance, Planning, Construction, Water Conservation,&#13;
Health, Education, Earthquake, Grain, and Audit Bureaus. The main functions of the&#13;
MLG are to coordinate the different government agencies involved, to approve major&#13;
policies related to the earthquake reconstruction activities, and to make sure the&#13;
counterpart fund for the project is available and future repayment is on time.&#13;
5.    ZMG has established a Municipal Leading Group Project Office (MPO), to be&#13;
headed by an vice director of the Zhangjiakou Finance Bureau (ZFB), staff of all&#13;
concerned government agencies are the members of the MPO. The project area includes 4&#13;
counties, 32 townships and 217 villages. The 4 counties and 32 townships will set up&#13;
project offices to monitor the project, and 217 village representatives will manage the&#13;
construction. The organization structure chart of this project is indicated in Figure A2. 1.&#13;
6.    Under the MPO, there are four divisions, credit management, project&#13;
management, materials and procurement, and technical advice. The staff of credit&#13;
management division are mainly from the municipal finance division, which will be&#13;
responsible for onlending the credit, withdrawal application, use of credit, delivery of&#13;
funds, and audit. The project management division is based on the municipal planning&#13;
bureau with the main functions of planning, design, and contract approval. Key persons&#13;
of materials/procurement and technical advice divisions are from the municipal&#13;
construction division, which will look after procurement, construction, quality&#13;
supervision and project completion review. The MPO will provide training and has the&#13;
authority to review the works in the county and township levels. The MPO has the&#13;
authority to release the responsibilities to a county or township if a lower-level office has&#13;
the ability and personnel to take over the works, and has the authority to take back the&#13;
works to a higher level if an office does not follow the government regulation and the&#13;
World Bank Group procurement and disbursement policies.&#13;
Project Management&#13;
7.    Since the project management involves so many levels, a proper contract&#13;
monitoring system has been set up that provides good monitoring of project progress.&#13;
Contracts incurred at a lower level should be reviewed and agreed by a higher level. A&#13;
system of responsibility and signature authorization has been established at each level&#13;
(see Table A2. 1). Disbursement staff will record the dates SOEs are received and&#13;
dispatched to trace financial performance. The time for reviewing the contracts and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
preparing the SOE documents should be very short; a proper working time at each level&#13;
should be established. The contract monitoring system and the disbursement system&#13;
should be set up and be agreed at each level before the disbursement begins.&#13;
8.    Quarterly progress reports would be submitted to the Bank Group by HPG, or its&#13;
designee, in a format acceptable to HPG and the Bank Group. The project quarterly&#13;
reports, together with contract awards, disbursement documents, and Bank Group&#13;
supervision missions would form the basis for routine monitoring of physical and&#13;
financial progress. The performance of the project will be measured against its objectives&#13;
by the MMPO and included in the Quarterly Progress Reports for IDA review.&#13;
Performance monitoring indicators have been defined for each project (sub)component.&#13;
9.    The provincial, municipal, county and township PMOs, through their well-&#13;
established finance bureaus/units, would maintain separate accounts and records for the&#13;
project and for all SOE-related expenditures. This arrangement provides clear allocation&#13;
of financial authority, responsibility and accountability with well-defined systems and&#13;
procedures. The financial documentation would be subject to audit by the Foreign&#13;
Investment Audit Bureau of the China National Audit Office (CNAO), established in 1983&#13;
under the name of State Audit Administration. The actual auditing work would be&#13;
conducted by the Hebei Provincial Audit Department under CNAO's supervision.&#13;

ANNEX 3: HOUSING AND PUBLIC BUILDING PRACTICES,&#13;
MODEL DESIGNS AND CONSTRUCTION ASPECTS&#13;
Existing Building Practices&#13;
1.    All houses and schools are similar in their essentials. They are single-story, one&#13;
room deep and two or more long. Dwelling rooms vary from 12 to 1l5 square meters (mi)&#13;
in area. The shape on plan is rectangular, with a south-facing elevation containing large&#13;
timber-framed windows (in order to capture solar gain) and an entirely blank north&#13;
elevation. Most walls are mud-brick or semicoursed random-rubble stonework, often&#13;
without mortar, and there are no foundations. Internal walls are rendered. Some houses&#13;
have clay brick leaves externally, untied and unbonded. The roofs are pitched at 30&#13;
degrees, with gables. Pine pole rafters (purlins) are nailed to larger poles spanning&#13;
between cross-walls and gable walls. Reed woven mats are wired to the purlins, and they&#13;
support a layer of mud into which interlocking clay tiles are bedded. The roof timbers&#13;
(corbels) are not tied to the walls, but in most cases rest within stepped projecting courses&#13;
of masonry. Hospitals and grain stores are larger, more complex and diverse in design.&#13;
Building Failures Observed&#13;
2.    Separation of Wall Leaves. Commonly, the outer leaf of a wall had peeled away&#13;
from the inner leaf and usually collapsed, leaving the inner leaf statnding in most cases.&#13;
The two leaves were of different materials with no bonding or ties laterally. The outer&#13;
leaf functioned as a separate structural element and had too large a height-to-width ratio&#13;
and length-to-height ratio to be stable in earthquake conditions. In some cases, the inner&#13;
leaf may have collapsed progressively as a result of the loss of the outer leaf. Lateral&#13;
bonding is vitally important to establish the structural integrity of the wall. This will&#13;
require the materials of both leaves to have compatible dimensions and similar structural&#13;
characteristics. This can be most readily achieved if they are the same material, sound&#13;
mortar is used and joints well filled.&#13;
3.    Separation of Adjacent Walls. Gable walls, side walls, and internal cross-walls&#13;
had often separated at the corners, with one or both leaning or collapsed. One could see in&#13;
most cases that there was no bonding, but even where bonded, the force of the earthquake&#13;
had sometimes separated the walls. It appeared that rafters were built into corbels at eaves&#13;
level, but not actually fixed to the wall and therefore incapable of restraining it.&#13;

4.    There was no evidence that movement of the roof had pushed over walls, but&#13;
rather that movement of the wall had led the rafters to collapse progressively. It is&#13;
important that the long front and rear walls are fully stabilized by the cross-walls and&#13;
gable walls, since otherwise their length-to-height ratio will render them unstable.&#13;
Probably bonding, though necessary, is not sufficient. The basic aim should be to&#13;
establish structural continuity, so that forces are shared by all walls together while the&#13;
roof has a similar role to play.&#13;
5.    Careful bonding is vital, but also steel mesh or steel bars bent at 90 degrees,&#13;
should be inserted every five courses in the horizontal joints, which should be made&#13;
deeper for the purpose. Furthermore, the cross-walls should be strong enough to perform&#13;
the task of stabilizing the front and rear walls, which requires minimal openings. Lastly,&#13;
but most importantly, a structurally continuous ring beam should run around the entire&#13;
building at a level between the eaves and the window heads. Typically this is reinforced&#13;
concrete or timber. It must be adequate to resist force from any direction, and should be&#13;
rigid at the corners. This will bind the walls together and prevent distortion. Turning now&#13;
to the roof, the rafters could be bolted to the ring beam, or strapped into the brickwork, or&#13;
cross-nailed to a timber wallplate, which should in turn be bolted to the ring beam. This&#13;
would certainly establish continuity laterally. But cross-bracing, perhaps by means of&#13;
diagonal members between purlins, might be advisable.&#13;
6.    Collapse of Piers and Beams on Front Elevation. In a few cases, the front&#13;
elevation had collapsed. There are exceptionally big windows to all rooms, but none at all&#13;
on the north-facing facades. The greenhouse effect heats up the walls from the inside,&#13;
which then radiate during the night. This creates a very soft wall on the south side and a&#13;
very hard one on the north. Conventional wisdom says that this extreme structural&#13;
asymmetry would cause destructive torsion effects during an earthquake. Surprisingly, we&#13;
saw relatively little clear evidence of this, but further study of this puzzling point would&#13;
be worthwhile. The narrow piers between windows had sometimes fallen forward and&#13;
were not tied effectively to the cross-walls behind them. The beams above, normally&#13;
precast concrete, were spanning only one bay. The rafters collapsed progressively,&#13;
although in a few cases the purlins had collapsed. Always they were seated on gable and&#13;
cross-walls, which usually remained standing. This probably saved a lot of people from&#13;
injury or worse.&#13;
7.    The piers were too narrow. In the case of the Hebei earthquake, that may not be&#13;
the main problem. The root cause of this failure was probably the discontinuity of the&#13;
beam. Each beam was resting on half a pier width, which might be as little as 300 mm.&#13;
This is inadequate. As the slender piers vibrated laterally, they caused the beams to fall,&#13;
but if the beam had been structurally continuous, this would not have occurred.&#13;
Furthermore, the piers were not tied to the cross-walls behind them, and so they were free&#13;
to move.&#13;

8.    So far as possible, the piers should be made thicker, or otherwise strengthened, for&#13;
example, by vertical reinforcement. The beam should be structurally continuous. The&#13;
piers should be firmly tied to the gable, by bonding and reinforcement consisting of steel&#13;
mesh or bars.&#13;
9.    Foundations. Traditionally foundations were not provided although there was&#13;
little evidence of failure arising from this. Nonetheless, it is recommended that stone-strip&#13;
foundations (or, still better, reinforced concrete ones) be provided. Frost in Hebei can&#13;
reach 2 m deep, but there was no clear evidence of frost heave and, reportedly, it does not&#13;
occur. This suggests that the footings need not be especially deep, although this must&#13;
always be subject to ground being suitable at the bottom of the trench. A depth of&#13;
700 mm may be generally acceptable. Even so, mud brick (or even poor clay brick) could&#13;
be damaged by groundwater or frost, and should not be used below the damp-proof&#13;
course.&#13;
10.   Complex Plan Forms. Complex plan forms-for example, E, L, X or similar&#13;
layouts-normally perform badly in earthquakes, as do long, thin rectangles. While the&#13;
mission saw little evidence of damage due to the L-shaped plan of some schools and the&#13;
hospital, we would still recommend that such forms be avoided.&#13;
11.   Proximity of Pit Latrines and Domestic Wells. It was noticed that drinking&#13;
water wells are located close to pit latrines. Particularly after an earthquake, this can&#13;
cause the water supply to be infiltrated by fecal matter, causing the spread of disease.&#13;
Standard Dwelling Designs&#13;
12.   The Zhangjiakou authorities had prepared model designs for a two-room house&#13;
and a three-room house, including specification notes and outline quantities and costs. On&#13;
the basis of the observed building failures and previous studies, the following design&#13;
recommendations were agreed upon.&#13;
13.   The Two-Room House. The design is fundamentally sound but consideration&#13;
should be given to the following points: Walls. It is proposed that all walls should be clay&#13;
brickwork, with external walls three bricks wide and internal walls two bricks wide. One&#13;
gable is two bricks wide, since a provision is made for a room to be added later.&#13;
Recommended as follows:&#13;
* A detail of the method of bonding should be prepared, since not all bonds are of equal&#13;
strength.&#13;
* The habit of building one wall completely before building the next one should be&#13;
abandoned. It is easier to achieve good bonding if all walls rise simultaneously, at&#13;
least at the corners.&#13;
* More information should be given to builders on mortar mixes, and they should be&#13;
told to reject all bags of cement affected by moisture. All joints should be properly&#13;
filled.&#13;

-17-                      ANNEX3&#13;
* Both gables should be three bricks deep, since the slenderness ratio is otherwise too&#13;
high&#13;
* All corners should be reinforced in the manner described in the previous section,&#13;
including junctions with internal walls.&#13;
14.   The piers should be wider and the openings narrower. Reversing the position of&#13;
front door and adjoining window would add strength to the end pier, which is particularly&#13;
narrow. The spandrel brickwork below this window should be restrained at the end next&#13;
to the door. Finally, if the piers cannot be adequately thickened, then consideration may&#13;
be given to vertical reinforcement, which could be tied to the horizontal reinforcement&#13;
previously mentioned.&#13;
15.   Ring BeaEn. A ring beam is proposed, with a continuous reinforced concrete&#13;
beam on the south elevation and reinforced brickwork elsewhere, but reinforcing bars are&#13;
overlapped at corners by 300 mm. The overlap is insufficient and should be a minimum&#13;
of 600 mm or more. Also parallel bars should be wired together with stirrups. Otherwise,&#13;
the proposal is probably adequate, although a reinforced concrete beam all the way round&#13;
would be even better. This would be more costly, of course. Recommended as follows:&#13;
* Proper guidance should be given on quality and quantities of constituent components,&#13;
as well as thoroughness of mixing and careful curing. If cast in situ, the concrete form&#13;
work should be of adequate quality and not distort, and nor should it be prematurely&#13;
struck;&#13;
* It is important to create continuity between bars. Stirrups should connect bars at&#13;
frequent intervals.&#13;
16.   Roof. The roof design follows the traditional principles. Improvements are&#13;
recommended as follows:&#13;
* Purlins and joists should be secured to the walls either by steel straps or by cross-&#13;
nailing to a wallplate bolted to the Ring Beam.&#13;
* The jointing of timbers should be described in more detail, as bad jointing can&#13;
weaken the overall structural integrity. Judging from the site inspection, it is not done&#13;
well at the moment.&#13;
* Diagonal bracing should perhaps be included to ensure that no distortion can occur.&#13;
* It may be advisable to put a timber spreader plate under the purlins where they sit on&#13;
the gable or cross-walls, in order to reduce the pressure at that point.&#13;
17.   Foundations. The foundations proposed are in coursed stone bedded in mortar to&#13;
a depth of 1.3 m and with a width at the base of 700 mm. This does seem adequate, and&#13;
some reduction in depth may be acceptable. Recommendations:&#13;

* Particular attention should be paid to the ground quality at the bottom of the trench,&#13;
and if an expert inspector believes it to be too soft, then remedial action should be&#13;
taken. It is an error to build on bad ground for economy reasons.&#13;
* Internal cross-walls should have similar foundations.&#13;
18.   The Three-Room House: Additional Points. The design for this house is similar&#13;
to that for the two-room house, and the same comments apply. Again, the design is&#13;
fundamentally sound but one internal cross-wall contains a window as well as a door. The&#13;
masonry is mud brick, and the wall is stabilized by timber columns connecting to the&#13;
purlins. Recommendations:&#13;
* The internal walls should be double-leafed brickwork, and the window should be&#13;
eliminated.&#13;
*  The previously mentioned design features should be incorporated here also, which is&#13;
to say: wall junctions should be bonded and reinforced, and there should foundations&#13;
similar to those elsewhere.&#13;
19.   Additional House Designs. Another six house designs were under preparation,&#13;
all with three bays and similar in dimensions to the previously mentioned three-room&#13;
house. The recommendations made above applied here too, but the following&#13;
recommendations can be added:&#13;
- The design with the re-entrant corner should be changed so that it is rectangular on&#13;
plan, since the proposed form is vulnerable.&#13;
3 The design with an open porch has a corner column freestanding. This should be&#13;
changed so that the corner of the building is solid masonry.&#13;
3 The variety of materials from which walls are composed creates doubt about their&#13;
performance and the lack of lateral bonding or ties between leaves should be&#13;
questioned.&#13;
* The flat roof design has the advantage of lightness, but may be vulnerable to high&#13;
winds and to snow load as well as condensation via cold bridges. Checks should be&#13;
made. Its appearance is a departure from tradition and some people may find it&#13;
aesthetically objectionable.&#13;
20.   Most of these designs are relatively expensive, and this arises in part from&#13;
needless complexity, which is not offering value for money. Overall, however, they are&#13;
sound in earthquake engineering terms.&#13;
Review of Designs for Public Building Types&#13;
21.   Schools. Three designs (for primary, middle and secondary school classrooms)&#13;
were prepared with alternative pitched and flat roofs. Generally they resembled the&#13;
dwelling designs, and appeared satisfactory, with the following recommendations:&#13;
* As with the dwellings, the piers on the south elevation should be wider and the&#13;
windows smaller if possible, in order to reduce the torsion caused by asymmetry. If&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20 -                       ANNEX3&#13;
this is not acceptable, due to solar heat requirements, then the piers should be&#13;
strengthened, perhaps by vertical reinforcement and buttresses.&#13;
* Ring beams are drawn at 240 mm x 120 mm deep. The depth is insufficient and the&#13;
design should be checked.&#13;
* The front and rear walls are in some cases very long and likely to flex dangerously if&#13;
not restrained by internal buttresses and a strong fixing to the roof trusses.&#13;
* The roof needs diagonal bracing.&#13;
* The flat roof option has the advantage of lightness but will be more vulnerable to&#13;
suction in windstorms and to snow loads.&#13;
. If a flat roof is used, then it is recommended to build it with a minimal gradient to&#13;
allow for rainwater runoff.&#13;
22.   Hospitals. Design preparations for the hospitals were less advanced. Only&#13;
sketches were prepared for a large and small hospital and for a clinic or ambulatory but&#13;
no construction drawings were available. It was noted that complex plan forms, namely&#13;
an H and an L shape, are being considered. However, such forms are particularly&#13;
vulnerable during earthquakes. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid complex plan&#13;
forms, and desegregated into separate rectangular blocks. If this is not feasible, then&#13;
movement joints should be provided at the interface of component rectangles.&#13;
23.   Grain Stores. The standard grain store is a reinforced concrete frame, with brick&#13;
infill panels and a steel-trussed roof. It measures some 60 m by 15 m by 6 m high, and is&#13;
a relatively complex structure. The following recommendations have been made:&#13;
* The form is long enough to merit at least one movement joint.&#13;
. The eaves detail incorporates a large overhang of excessive depth and weight.&#13;
Lightweight eaves should be provided instead, since such a heavy feature, eccentric to&#13;
the columns, presents a risk.&#13;
* The upper ring beam, at eaves level, is not deep enough.&#13;
Review of Building Materials&#13;
24.   The roofs are too massive to be safe, and in principle they should be lighter. It&#13;
would require lightweight insulation as a substitute for mud; and also sawed and stress-&#13;
graded timber for purlins and joists. Without the mud, tiles would have to be pegged to&#13;
battens, or some type of roof sheeting used. It appeared that this would be prohibitively&#13;
expensive.&#13;
25.   The need for economy compelled the use of mud brick in places. This is too&#13;
brittle a material and far from suitable for use in earthquake areas. The scope for concrete&#13;
block as an affordable but superior alternative is being considered. The Zhangjiakou&#13;
Light Concrete Enterprise makes concrete blocks utilizing volcanic rock, which is&#13;
quarried in the general earthquake area. They use small quasi-mobile plant, and it would&#13;
be possible to establish local production at several places in the earthquake zone. The&#13;
material test certificate shows that it has adequate structural and thermal qualities, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-                      ANNEX3&#13;
reportedly slightly cheaper than mud brick. It will allow sounder building and will also&#13;
enhance the livelihood of local people in the earthquake area.&#13;
Construction Costs and Review of Possible Economy Measures&#13;
26.   Two Room House. The total labor value is Y 2,170 and the total material value is&#13;
Y 10,080. The labor element is divided into self-help, valued at two thirds or Y 1,450 and&#13;
paid skilled labor, valued at one third or Y 725. The material element is divided into new&#13;
material (Y 7,970) and recycled material (Y 2,120). The new material will be paid for, but&#13;
the recycled material will be prepared at no charge. The self-help labor will be done at no&#13;
charge, but the skilled labor may be either paid cash or by labor onsite or by recycled&#13;
material. There are two scenarios: only the new material cost is repaid or the skilled labor&#13;
plus materials.&#13;
27.   Scope for 'Economy Measures. While the total value of Y 12,253 and the cost&#13;
rate of Y 385 per m do appear reasonable and realistic, there are nonetheless fears that in&#13;
so poverty-stricken an area, they may not be generally affordable. Consideration was&#13;
given to economy measures. Below is scheduled the possible items of saving.&#13;
1. Substitute mud brick or concrete block in all walls.  Y 450&#13;
2. Reduce foundation depth from 1.3 m to 700 mm.          592&#13;
3. Omit ground concrete surface next to foundations.       52&#13;
4. Omit ceiling                                           405&#13;
5. Omit internal wall plastering                          175&#13;
6. Omit concrete skirting.                                 30&#13;
7. Omit whitewashing of internal walls.                    36&#13;
Total Saving:                                          Y 1,740&#13;
28.   The omitted items could be easily completed later at the expense of the&#13;
householder. The other items are deemed essential regardless of the earthquake resistance&#13;
issue. The use of mud brick walls is feasible, although it is important that the quality of&#13;
work is good and the techniques sound. Few houses currently have any foundations and&#13;
yet there was little evidence that clearly indicated failure for this reason. Therefore, one&#13;
would contemplate some economy on the foundations. There is no scope for economizing&#13;
on the ring beam.&#13;
29.   Alternative Scenarios. Below is illustrated several options regarding the loan&#13;
principal for the two-room house mentioned above. It is suggested that the provincial&#13;
government consider whether some such economies would allow the inevitably scarce&#13;
resources to secure more widespread good. Obviously, the motive concerns resource&#13;
allocation and not architectural or technical questions.&#13;
Full design plus skilled labor                         Y 8,690&#13;
Full design without skilled labor                        7,970&#13;
Reduced design in clay brick plus skilled labor          7,400&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-                       ANNEX3&#13;
Reduced design in clay brick without skilled labor         6,680&#13;
Reduced design in mud brick/concrete block plus skilled labor  6,950&#13;
Reduced design in mud brick/concrete block without skilled labor  6,230&#13;
30.   It is noted that the above figures do not include the cost of the recommended&#13;
design improvements above. It is estimated that these costs would be between Y 200 and&#13;
Y 400. Such extra expense is justified in the interests of earthquake resistance while the&#13;
amenity measures can be feasibly accomplished at a later time.&#13;
31.   Public Buildings. In the schools sector, the total program comprises 2,707 rooms&#13;
in 127 schools, at a total cost of Y 28.2 million. The cost rate is Y 520 per m2. In the&#13;
health sector, there will be 26 projects at a total cost of Y 8.0 million. The cost rate is&#13;
2&#13;
Y 527 per m . In the grain sector, there will be 18 projects at a total cost of Y 20.6&#13;
million. The cost rate is Y 1,270 per m2.&#13;
32.   The cost rate for schools and hospitals is reasonable. The far higher cost rate of&#13;
the grain store design is due to the more sophisticated construction, as well as much&#13;
greater span and height. However, there may be scope for refinement and simplification&#13;
of the design, leading to economies.&#13;
Other Factors&#13;
33.   Geotechnical and Site Conditions. While general geological data are available,&#13;
there appears to have been no assessment of localized conditions, or the impact they&#13;
would have on construction technique or choice of site. It can be dangerous to build close&#13;
to fault lines or on sloping ground, unless it is terraced and stabilized. Similarly, building&#13;
on outwash fans or alluvial soil in narrow valleys imposes very important conditions on&#13;
the design and should be avoided if possible.&#13;
34.   Availability of Construction Materials. The total quantities of materials&#13;
required for all the reconstruction was estimated as well as the total production capacity&#13;
in the area. For example, the project will require 134 million bricks, and local production&#13;
capacity is said to be 1.2 billion. As for tiles, 6.9 million will be needed against a capacity&#13;
of 10 million. Cement capacity is 1.5 million tons, and the need here is for 27,000. Only&#13;
in the case of timber will imports (Heilongjiang) be needed.&#13;
35.   Manpower. The total manpower requirements has been calculated in person-days&#13;
based on standard norms, and assumed that the unskilled labor-about two thirds-will&#13;
be provided by self-help, while the remainder, that is the skilled element comprising two&#13;
thirds, will be provided by labor gangs. It is estimated that 418 teams of 18 workers each&#13;
-a total of 7,524 workers for the target time of 150 days-will be required. It was&#13;
reported that the construction sector labor force in the city region is over 100,000 persons.&#13;
36.   Skill Dissemination  and  Quality  Control. The implementing agencies&#13;
responsible for construction management have properly equipped materials testing&#13;
laboratory available. They will appoint between one and three Quality Control Inspectors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23 -                       ANNEX3&#13;
to each village, and after a training course, they will perform tests and random inspections&#13;
on site. They will be independent in status and report their findings to the Project Office.&#13;
37.   The matter of knowledge dissemination is of fundamental importance for the&#13;
successful implementation of the project. The local project leadership understands this&#13;
and have proposed an extensive training program of a formal type, and also a type of&#13;
onsite organization that would facilitate skill transfer between craftsmen and local&#13;
farmers engaged in construction. It is suggested that booklets and posters, as well as a&#13;
video of a demonstration project and large-scale models, would facilitate understanding&#13;
of technical points. The drawings so far produced have two defects in this respect: they&#13;
are too technical to be understood by ordinary people and also they lack detail of the&#13;
precise mode and sequence of work. In short, they presuppose a level of prior training and&#13;
knowledge thalt many do not possess. Perspective drawings at a level of detail should be&#13;
prepared, and strip cartoons could be used to explain the sequence of operations. Posters&#13;
and booklets should also explain in simple terms the underlying reasons for things, and&#13;
not only the things themselves. The funds for assistance by local consultants has been&#13;
included in the credit to help the local authorities to produce the materials as well as to&#13;
assist in the dissemination effort.&#13;
38.   Community Participation. More attention needs to be given to community&#13;
involvement in the design and implementation of the reconstruction effort, particularly&#13;
the housing reconstruction. A lack of grassroots commitment will doom the project to&#13;
failure, and it is vital that the professionals and government officers take the feelings of&#13;
the local villagers fully into account, particularly as regards the financial and labor&#13;
arrangements. Project staff should meet the villagers soon in order to explain fully all&#13;
bottomline matters and check out their views so as to incorporate them into the project&#13;
before it starts. Technical assistance by local consultants for this purpose has been&#13;
incorporated in the project design.&#13;
Technical Assistance Component&#13;
39.   The general ability and expertise of technicians and administrators working on the&#13;
project is relatively high, but they will benefit from advice prior to and during project&#13;
execution in several fields. Their basic knowledge, leaming capacity, organizing ability&#13;
and energy is such, that a major program will not be needed. The following areas for&#13;
assistance have been identified:&#13;
*  Geotechnical Assessment. The aim is to transmit knowledge and understanding of&#13;
the significance of microzoning and the need to link this to choice of both sites and&#13;
techniques of construction;&#13;
.  Building Design and Quality Control. The aim  is to reinforce and deepen&#13;
knowledge of the relevant research, design principles, and detailed design and&#13;
construction techniques, and also to check current design and execution, and advise in&#13;
a concrete, practical and detailed way on feasible improvement. Additionally, advice&#13;
on all aspects of Quality Control should be given;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24 -                      ANNEX3&#13;
Dissemination Techniques and Community Participation. The aim is to advise on&#13;
the best techniques for communicating relevant knowledge to (and obtaining and&#13;
reacting to feedback from) construction workers, quality control inspectors , the local&#13;
community and others. Assistance with the preparation of communication material&#13;
should be provided; and&#13;
*  Project Organization and Management. The aim is to examine and suggest feasible&#13;
improvements to technical organization both overall and in specific component parts,&#13;
and likewise to suggest improvements to the management of construction,&#13;
procurement, supply chain operation, liaison, financial planning and control and other&#13;
relevant matters, including the transfer of general principles as well as project-specific&#13;
issues.&#13;
40.   The manpower input has been estimated at 10 person-months of local consultants&#13;
and will occur in three stages: at the inception, early stages of execution, and the&#13;
conclusion of the first construction season. The first report should be submitted in April&#13;
and the final report in October. The following expertise has been identified:&#13;
*  Geotechnics         one person, one month       1 person-month&#13;
*  Building           three persons, seven weeks   5 person-months&#13;
3  Community           one person, one month       1 person-month&#13;
*  Management         two persons, seven weeks     2 person-months&#13;

ANNEX 4: WATER CONSERVANCY FACILITIES&#13;
Drinking Water Reinstatement&#13;
1.    This component of the project is designed to reinstate potable water supplies to&#13;
villages in three counties (Zhangbei, Shangyi, Kangbao). The proposed works include&#13;
130 wells repaired or replaced (approximately 20 percent repaired, 80 percent replaced);&#13;
pumps; pipelines; storage tanks; house connections; and standpipes.&#13;
2.    The total population to be served by this component of the project is 66,000, made&#13;
up of 20,000 in Zhangbei, 30,000 in Shangyi and 16,000 in Kangbao. Of this total, about&#13;
90 percent will have household connections and the remainder will rely on standpipe&#13;
supplies. The proportion of those having household connections will be considerably&#13;
higher than existed prior to the earthquake.&#13;

5.    The wells are either drilled or dug by hand, depending on the local&#13;
hydrogeological conditions and other factors. Drilled wells are typically 400-500 mm in&#13;
diameter and 200 m or more in depth. They are lined with a concrete sleeve. Hand-dug&#13;
wells are typically 1.2 m diameter at the surface, and up to 3 or 4 m diameter at their&#13;
base. The depth of the hand-dug wells is usually 15-20 m, and they are normally lined&#13;
with stone.&#13;
6.    Each well is equipped with a pump, mostly driven by an electric motor although a&#13;
few in remote areas are driven by a diesel engine. The pump and wellhead are enclosed in&#13;
a small brick building. Storage is provided by a concrete tank. The pipeline carrying the&#13;
water from the well to the village is buried, and the materials used depend on the size of&#13;
the pipeline and whether it is under pressure or under gravity flow. Small-diameter&#13;
pipelines (50-100 mm) are made of plastic (probably PVC), medium-diameter pipelines&#13;
(150-250 mm) are earthenware, and large diameter pipelines (&gt; 300 mm) are made of&#13;
concrete. There is normally further storage provided within the village and small-&#13;
diameter plastic pipe is used to connect the supply to each household. No treatment is to&#13;
be provided as the quality of the well water is generally very good, and in any event the&#13;
population in this region follows the traditional practice of boiling water before drinking.&#13;
Water Conservancy Facilities&#13;
7.    This component of the project is designed to repair or rebuild water conservancy&#13;
facilities in two counties (Zhangbei, Wanquan). The works to be repaired or rebuilt are&#13;
principally canals and offices/dormitories owned by the water conservancy authority, and&#13;
include expenditures for the repair of collapsed canal lining, repairs to inlet and outlet&#13;

dam crest and slope failures occurred on both the upstream and downstream dam faces.&#13;
Additionally, the outlet tunnel and the water intake tower were damaged, a rockslide&#13;
occurred on one side of the spillway channel and a large number of buildings belonging&#13;
to the water conservancy authority were damaged.&#13;
9.    The Friendship Reservoir is the largest water storage facility in northern Hebei&#13;
province and is a vital element in the water supply system of this region. The reservoir is&#13;
on the Dongyanghe River and sits at the border of Hebei Province and Inner Mongolia in&#13;
Shangyi County. The dam forming this reservoir was constructed in 1958 and underwent&#13;
some modifications in 1970. The reservoir is a multipurpose facility used for water&#13;
supply (mainly irrigation), flood control and hydroelectricity. The original storage&#13;
capacity was 116 million mi3; however, much of this has been lost due to siltation and it is&#13;
3&#13;
understood the capacity is now only 60 million m3.&#13;
10.   The dam is an earthfill structure, 40 m high, approximately 290 m long. The crest&#13;
is at an elevation of RL1200 m, is 4.0 m wide and has a 1.2 m high wave wall along the&#13;
upstream edge. Both the upstream and downstream faces of the dam have a rock rip-rap&#13;
protective layer. The slopes of the dam faces vary from 1:2.5 to 1:3.5. The downstream&#13;
toe has a rock filter. The dam is designed to operate normally in a flood of up to 1 00-year&#13;
return period, and is rated as safe in a flood event of up to 1,000-year return period. This&#13;
falls short of the national standard safety rating for dams in China of a minimum 2,000-&#13;
year return period, and this is one reason why upgrading works are being proposed (see&#13;
below).&#13;
11.   The intake structure is located to the right of the dam wall, between the dam and&#13;
the spillway. It is an inclined structure about 25 m deep, containing an inclined steel gate&#13;
operated by a cable winch. The outlet tunnel is 2.2 m diameter, reducing downstream to&#13;
1.8 m diameter. Maximum discharge capacity is 39 cubic meters per second (m3/sec).&#13;
12.   The spillvvay is cut through rock on the right side of the dam. The spillway is at&#13;
RL 1193 m, 7 m below the dam crest. It is a chute spillway about 200 m long with energy&#13;
dissipaters at the downstream end. Maximum discharge capacity is 1,030 m3/sec.&#13;
13.   The power station is located below the dam and is equipped with three 400 kW&#13;
turbine generators. Power is delivered to Shangyi County via a 35 kV transmission line.&#13;
Irrigation water is delivered to three counties (Wanquan, Huaian and Shangyi) and the&#13;
reservoir currently supports 200,000 mu of irrigated land.&#13;
14.   The work proposed to be carried out on the reservoir and dam falls under two&#13;
categories, repairs to the damage caused by the earthquake, and a general upgrading and&#13;
refurbishment to make it function more safely and efficiently. The cracks in the dam are&#13;
to be investigated further. It is proposed that cracks of less than 3 m depth will be filled&#13;
with compacted soil. Cracks deeper than 3 m will be filled with cement grout. The&#13;
proposed works are summarized below:&#13;

15.    During a site visit on March 6, cracks and slope failures were observed. On&#13;
questioning the local staff it was apparent that the extent of seepage through the dam had&#13;
increased following the earthquake. The color of the seepage water had not changed&#13;
however, indicating that there was not a noticeable increase in transport of fine material&#13;
from the body of the dam. At the time of the site visit the reservoir water level was at&#13;
RL1 190.8 m, approximately 9 m below the dam crest. During the flood season (summer)&#13;
the water level could be expected to rise several meters above this level. It was apparent&#13;
from the site visit that the dam was potentially dangerous and was in need of urgent&#13;
remedial works.&#13;
16.    Cost estimates have been made of cost of the proposed works. The extent of&#13;
repairs needed to remedy the earthquake damage is still under investigation and because&#13;
of the nature of the work it is unlikely that this can be accurately costed at this point in&#13;
time. Estimates are as follows:&#13;

17.   The darnage to the dam has been investigated by the Hebei Investigation and&#13;
Design Institute of Water Conservancy and Hydropower of the Ministry of Water&#13;
resources and the plans prepared to date for repairing the dam are based on these findings.&#13;
There is clearly some urgency in completing the repairs to the dam before the next flood&#13;
season commences around June/July and the following issues are to be considered. The&#13;
exact extent of repairs will not be known until after all investigations are complete, and&#13;
even then there is a possibility that the need for further repairs may be discovered after&#13;
the repair work commences.&#13;

ANNEX 5: REGENERATION OF AGRICULTURAL&#13;
PRODUCTIVITY&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Location. The three counties affected by the earthquake are Zhangbei, Shangyi&#13;
and Kangbao. The three counties are located at the southern edge of the Mongolia plateau&#13;
with the elevation from 1,200 to 1,500 m. The three counties share the border with Inner&#13;
Mongolia in the north and Zhangjiakou City in the south and southeast. It is about&#13;
250 km from Beijing to the area. The total area of the three counties is 10,170 km2, of&#13;
2                  ~~~~~~~~~~~2&#13;
which 1,017 km2 is urban area and 9,153 km  is rural area. The total farmland is&#13;
320,000 ha (4.8 million mu).&#13;
2.    Climate. With an inland monsoon climate and average annual precipitation of&#13;
389.7 mm, drought occurs 9 years out of 10 in this area. The frost-free period is only 90&#13;
to 110 days. The natural conditions are unfavorable for agricultural production.&#13;
3.    Demographics. There are 47 townships and 836 villages in the three counties.&#13;
The total population of the three counties is 849,000, of which 76,000 is urban population&#13;
and 773,000 is rural population.&#13;
4.    Socioeconomics. The urban economy is based on a processing industry of&#13;
agricultural products, winery, sugar mill and leather industry, as well as small business.&#13;
The total farmland of the three counties is 4.8 million mu, of which 4.3 million mu is&#13;
rainfed area and 0.5 million mu is irrigated area. Due to unfavorable natural conditions,&#13;
agriculture productivity is very low in this area. The average holding of farmland is&#13;
6.2 mu per capita or some 25 mu per household. The average annual income in urban&#13;
areas in Y 2,000 per capita while in the rural areas this is only Y 1,200 per capita. The&#13;
three counties are on the national poverty list.&#13;
5.    Damage by Earthquake. In the three counties, 336 villages with 470,000 persons&#13;
are affected by the earthquake. About 861 tube wells and 983 small stone wells were&#13;
damaged by the earthquake, which affected the water supply to some 75,000 people and&#13;
the irrigation to some 380,000 mu of farmland.&#13;
Dryland Agriculture&#13;
6.    Present Agriculture. The present crop pattern and yields are listed in Table A5. 1.&#13;

7.    Markets. Most of the grain grown in the area is consumed by the farmers&#13;
themselves. About half of the vegetable and bean crop is sold to Beijing and Tianjin. The&#13;
prices of the local crops is listed in Table A5.2.&#13;

9.    Salt and Water Balance. Groundwater is the major source for irrigation in the&#13;
area. The extent of pumping of groundwater for the scheme will not raise the groundwater&#13;
level. Also, the existing irrigation experience indicates no soil salination problems.&#13;
Therefore, soil salination is not expected in the new irrigation areas.&#13;
Water Resources&#13;

11.    Groundwater is the major water resource in the three counties. In order to&#13;
maintain sustainable development of the groundwater resources, the exploitable&#13;
groundwater resources has been determined carefully. Table A5.5 lists the results of&#13;
water resources analysis for the plain areas in Zhangbei, Shangyi and Kangbao.&#13;

12.    The sustainable exploitable groundwater resource is the result of the total inflow&#13;
to the groundwater times a factor of 0.7. The total exploitable groundwater resources in&#13;
the three counties is calculated at some 150 million m3 per year. The existing surface&#13;
water resources projects can supply 90 million m3 per year. Therefore, the total&#13;
sustainable water supply quantity is 240 million m3 per year in Zhangbei, Shangyi and&#13;
Kangbao Counties. The present water application statues are listed in Table A5.6.&#13;

13.   The present water application is about 70 million m3 per year, accounting for less&#13;
than 30 percent of the total sustainable water supply quantity. Therefore, the remaining&#13;
potential water supply quantity is over 170 million mi3. The present surface water&#13;
application volume is 28.4 million m3 per year, accounting for 31 percent of the existing&#13;
surface water supply capacity, and the present groundwater application volume is 38.4&#13;
million m3, accounting for 26 percent of exploitable groundwater resources. The&#13;
remaining exploitable groundwater resources is 110 million m3n&#13;
Outline Irrigation Project&#13;
14.   Location. The irrigation scheme will benefit 29 townships and 228 villages in the&#13;
three counties. The extent of present irrigation and proposed irrigation areas in Zhangbei,&#13;
Shangyi and Kangbao counties is listed in Tables A5.7, A5.8 and A5.9. The new&#13;
irrigation areas were selected through a consultation process with the villages and&#13;
townships.&#13;
15.   Scope. The scheme includes the development of 50 deep tube wells, 150 shallow&#13;
tube wells, 300 large dug wells with associated sprinkler and drainage systems, as well as&#13;
road infrastructure. In addition, the project will provide some 4,500 small stone wells to&#13;
the farmers. The farm road system is in need of upgrading while small-scale drainage&#13;
work should be constructed. All the new irrigation areas have access to 1O kV power&#13;
supply.&#13;

Financing Arrangement&#13;
20.   The total cost of the irrigation scheme is estimated at Y 64.7 million, of which 70&#13;
percent will be financed by the IDA credit. The balance will be raised from project&#13;
counterpart funds (Y 15.1 million) and Y 4.3 million will be raised by farmers, mainly&#13;
through labor contribution (average 5 days per capita). The sources of the project&#13;
counterpart funds are listed in Table A5.14. IDA funds will be applied to: (a) civil works&#13;
for well drilling by specialized firms, and (b) materials and equipment for wells and&#13;
sprinkler systems. The remainder will be funded by local financing.&#13;

Implementation Arrangements&#13;
21.   The proposed irrigation project will be implemented in a three-year period: the&#13;
first year 20 percent, the second year 50 percent, the third year 30 percent. Tube wells&#13;
will be constructed by specialized well-drilling teams, of which there are 17 specialized&#13;
firms in the Zhangjiakou area. The construction of large dug wells will be organized by&#13;
the townships through labor contributions by the farmers under skilled supervision. The&#13;
construction of small stone wells will be organized by villages and constructed by&#13;
farmers.&#13;
22.   The Project Management Office (PMO) for the irrigation scheme will be&#13;
established under Zhangjiakou Earthquake Reconstruction Leading Group and the three&#13;
counties. The responsibility of the PMO is to supervise the implementation of the scheme&#13;
as well as quality control. The design will be carried out by the Zhangjiakou Design&#13;
Office of Water Resources Engineering under the guidance of the Hebei Design Institute&#13;
of Water Resources Engineering. The PMO will technically be supported by the Bureau&#13;
of Water Resources of Zhangjiakou and the Bureau of Water Resources at the county&#13;
level.&#13;
Operation and Maintenance&#13;
23.   Water Management. The water resources engineering station has been&#13;
established at the township level. The station will supervise the operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) of the irrigation. A special team for the O&amp;M of tube wells, large&#13;
dug wells and irrigation has also existed at each village. Under the leadership of village&#13;
committee, the team will operate and maintain the wells and sprinkler irrigation system,&#13;
will record data and will collect the water fee. The irrigation fee has been estimated at&#13;
Y 90/mu (total O&amp;M cost of scheme divided by 120,000 mu).&#13;
24.   O&amp;M Costs. The costs of O&amp;M include labor, power, repair and depreciation.&#13;
The total O&amp;M cost is Y 10.9 million and the details are as follows: (a) labor costs: the&#13;
annual cost for O&amp;M staff is Y 2,000 per person. With one person managing a 100 mu&#13;
sprinkler irrigation area, to develop a 100,000 mu sprinkler irrigation area 1,000 staff are&#13;
required. Therefore, the total labor cost for O&amp;M is Y 2.0 million; (b) electricity costs:&#13;
each tube well and large dug well can irrigate a 200 mu area; each small stone well can&#13;
irrigate 5 mu. To irrigate the total area, the annual power consumption of each deep tube&#13;
well, shallow tube well, large dug well and small stone well are 9,000, 8,400, 4,200 and&#13;
2,100 kWh, respectively. The unit cost of power is Y 0.45/kWh. Therefore, the annual&#13;
power cost is Y 5.6 million to operate 50 deep tube wells, 150 shallow tube wells, 300&#13;
large dug wells and 4,500 small stone wells; (c) repair cost: the annual repair cost is&#13;
Y 0.6 million, i.e., 1 percent of the construction cost; and (d) depreciation: the annual&#13;
depreciation cost is Y 2.7 million, i.e., 4.5 percent of the total construction cost.&#13;

26.   The total gross incremental revenue from the 122,500 mu irrigated area is Y 46.43&#13;
million per year. The marginal value of water is Y 2.13/m3. The crop budgets are listed in&#13;
Tables 1 to 8 in the attachment to this Annex.&#13;
27.   Expenditures. The total investment for the development of new irrigation scheme&#13;
is Y 64.7 million and the annual O&amp;M cost for the 120,000 mu irrigation area is&#13;
estimated at Y 10.9 million. The depreciation and O&amp;M costs will be entirely recovered&#13;
from the farmers through a water charge of Y 0.5/m3.&#13;
28.   Rate of Return. The cash flow of the irrigation project is listed in Table A5.16.&#13;
With the prevailing interest rate at 8 percent, the repayment period is calculated at a little&#13;
over two years. If 15 percent of the net revenue (Y 290/mu) from the irrigation area is&#13;
used to service the IDA credit, it will take about eight years.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This is a credit to the People's
            Republic of China to help finance the Hebei Earthquake
            Rehabilitation Project. The project's primary objective
            is to assist in the restoration of economic and social
            activities following an earthquake in Zhangjiakou
            Municipality in northwest Hebei province, by restoring
            social and economic infrastructure and priority production
            facilities. A second objective is to strengthen the
            socioeconomic situation in the area through enhancing
            productive activities, which would alleviate the extreme
            poverty. The project supports emergency reconstruction,
            repair, and rehabilitation (and for some components,
            equipment purchases) of housing; schools; health care
            facilities; grain storage facilities; drinking water
            facilities--including distribution networks; water
            conservancy facilities--a reservoir, wells, buildings,
            canals, bridges, aqueducts, etc.; and irrigation
            works--shallow stone wells, dug wells, tube wells, and small
            sprinkler irrigation systems. An added component provides
            technical assistance, training, and support to municipal,
            county, and township level agencies, particularly for
            building standard development, project management, and monitoring.
