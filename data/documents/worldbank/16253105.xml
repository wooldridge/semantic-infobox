            Internet access : regulatory levers for a
            knowledge economy
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Internet access depends on four critical
            players: First, providers of telecommunications
            infrastructure (bandwidth capacity) for international access
            to the global Internet backbone. Second, providers of
            national long-distance telecommunications transmission
            capacity (such as leased lines) to connect Internet service
            providers (ISPs) with one another and with international
            connectivity nodes. Third, providers of local loop access
            (narrowband and analogue, such as traditional copper wire
            connections, or broadband and digital, such as digital
            subscriber lines [DSL], cable television modems, and fixed
            wireless service). Fourth, ISPs, which provide Internet
            services to customers using these layers of networks.
            Expanding Internet access requires cooperative behavior by
            these players, and regulators have a key role in ensuring
            such behavior. A regulatory strategy for doing so focuses on
            promoting the telecommunications infrastructure, enabling
            viable ISPs, ensuring efficient pricing, maintaining
            appropriate service quality, supporting diffusion in remote
            areas, and ensuring legal certainty for electronic
            transactions. Promoting the telecommunications
            Infrastructure - competition is key. So regulators should
            take a permissive approach to licensing multiple financially
            sound providers (owners and resellers) of telecommunications
            infrastructure for international connectivity, alternative
            national long distance networks, and local loop access. To
            ensure competition in the ISP market, regulators should
            require no formal licensing for ISPs; simple registration
            should suffice.
