between face-to-face meetings on a no-objection basis involving all members of the SC.&#13;
The SC will meet in person twice a year or more often if necessary. SC meeting locations&#13;
and dates will be proposed by the Secretariat and agreed by the SC.&#13;
2. GPSA Secretariat&#13;
A Secretariat housed in the World Bank has the responsibility to manage the funding,&#13;
networking, communications, reporting and administrative tasks of the GPSA as well as&#13;
the overall management of the GPSA, including coordination, administration and grant-&#13;
