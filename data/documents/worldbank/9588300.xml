            Economic impacts of sanitation in Vietnam :
            a five-country study conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao
            PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam under the Economics of
            Sanitation Initiative (ESI)
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Vietnam, like other countries of Asia,
            is on a development path that is lifting large numbers of
            people out of poverty and improving access to goods and
            services that improve quality of life. Vietnam has done well
            so far in achieving significant development gains,
            especially in terms of poverty reduction. However, some
            aspects of development are being forgotten in the race to
            economic progress, affecting especially the vulnerable and
            low income groups. Sanitation is one such neglected aspect
            of development. In places where the public purse is severely
            limited and population needs seemingly boundless, sanitation
            is not deemed attractive or important enough to gain the
            attention of politicians or journalists. It is often seen as
            a private matter to be handled by the household or local
            community, and something that results from economic
            development rather than being seen as a precondition for
            economic development. Also, institutionally, sanitation is
            sidelined by lack of clear ministerial responsibilities.
            This study examines the major health, water, environmental,
            tourism, and other welfare impacts associated with poor
            sanitation. By examining the economic impacts of poor
            sanitation, and the potential gains from improved
            sanitation, this study provides important evidence to
            support further investments in sanitation.
