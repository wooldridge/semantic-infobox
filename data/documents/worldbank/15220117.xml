latrines and septic tanks. These interventions have the high-&#13;

annual economic rate of return was more than 100 percent,&#13;

reduced mortality and access time savings associated with&#13;
improved, private latrines. The reuse value for compost-&#13;
ing latrines is relatively small compared to health and time&#13;
benefits, while for biogas digesters the reuse value (electric-&#13;
ity and sludge value) makes up more than three-quarters of&#13;
the economic benefit; for biogas digesters a major part of&#13;
the excreta comes from animals, not humans. The annualized&#13;
cost of a double-vault composting latrine of US$40 is margin-&#13;
ally higher than that of a pit latrine of US$30, but the differ-&#13;
ence in up-front investment cost is more marked (US$110&#13;
versus US$190). Options with septic tank are considerably&#13;
                                                                   US$&#13;

more expensive. The investment cost of a septic tank aver-&#13;
ages US$322 (annualized US$70) and is exceeded by septic&#13;
tank with safe septage management of US$531 (annualized&#13;
US$93). A biogas digester (not shown in Figure 3) has an in-&#13;
vestment cost of US$9,339 (annualized US$1,310).&#13;

Under actual program conditions, there is a small decline in&#13;
performance for all sanitation options. This is due to projects&#13;

       was found for improved wet pit latrines, with a benefit-&#13;
       cost ratio of 8.6. The annual economic rate of return&#13;
       was more than 100 percent, requiring less than one year&#13;
       to recover the economic value of the initial investment&#13;
       costs. Septic tanks with no post-treatment were evalu-&#13;
       ated in four of the five urban sites, and have a benefit-&#13;
       cost ratio of 3.6. The sanitation options evaluated with&#13;
       improved off-site excreta management had a benefit-&#13;
       cost ratio of 2.7 (sewerage with treatment). These lat-                                                                  Reuse&#13;

       The two major contributors to the economic benefits&#13;
       were reduced mortality and access time savings asso-&#13;
       ciated with improved, private latrines. The reuse value of&#13;
       sludge from safe off-site septage management contrib-&#13;
       uted a small proportion of economic benefits (less than&#13;
       20 percent). The annualized wet pit latrines of US$20,&#13;
       with an investment cost averaging US$88 across the&#13;
       sites, is by far the cheapest option. However, due to&#13;
       space limitations and risk of polluting groundwater&#13;
                                                                    US$&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
       and neighborhoods, pit latrines without treatment are&#13;
       not a feasible option in most urban areas of Vietnam.&#13;
       Septic tanks with partial but inadequate treatment (as&#13;
       most are not properly designed) cost US$416 (annual-&#13;
       ized US$65). Septic tanks with improved septage man-&#13;
       agement cost US$530 investment (annualized US$78),&#13;
       while sewerage costs more than twice as much at&#13;
       US$1,361 (annualized US$134).&#13;
                                                                                               Investment       Maintenance             Operations&#13;
       For the urban centers, where off-site sanitation seems&#13;
       the most feasible option, high connection rate of house-&#13;
       hold to the sewerage and drainage system is a very im-&#13;

            The Economic Returns of Sanitation

        <abstracts>
            The Economics of Sanitation Initiative
            (ESI) is a multi-country study launched in 2007 as a
            response by the World Bank's Water and Sanitation
            Program to address major gaps in evidence among developing
            countries on the economic aspects of sanitation. Its
            objective is to provide economic evidence to increase the
            volumes and efficiency of public and private spending on
            sanitation. This research brief summarizes the key findings
            the study of second phase cost-benefit analysis of
            alternative sanitation options from Vietnam. The study
            results presented in this report focus on human excreta
            management, covering selected field sites as well as
            national surveys. The main report also presents results on
            the costs and benefits of solid waste management in four
            field sites. Surveys were conducted in nine rural and eight
            urban sites that have recently been the focus of sanitation
            programs or projects, of which 13 were implementing improved
            toilet and wastewater management options. Overall 2,400
            household questionnaires were administered, and focus group
            discussions, physical investigations, water quality
            assessments, market surveys and health facility surveys were
            conducted in each site. Primary data were supplemented with
            data from other national and local surveys.
