MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD&#13;
This Annual Report, covering July 1, 1996 to June 30,&#13;
1997, chronicles a year of renewal at the World Bank.&#13;
Strengthening partnerships and getting results in serving the&#13;
poorest people in the world are two recurring themes run-&#13;
ning through these pages. Nowhere have these two objec-&#13;
tives been better illustrated than in the strengthened work-&#13;
ing relationship that is being forged between management&#13;
and staff of the World Bank and its shareholders represented&#13;
by the Executive Board.&#13;
Over the last ten years the environment for the Bank's&#13;
clients has changed dramatically. While official development&#13;
assistance has declined, private capital flows have surged.&#13;
But they have been concentrated in a comparatively small&#13;
number of countries. At the same time, the role of civil&#13;
society and that of the private sector have become more pronounced, governments have&#13;
become more accountable for their actions, and all the players rely on the new capacity to&#13;
share knowledge rapidly as a result of dramatic changes in technology.&#13;
As the Bank has recognized these developments, we have introduced new approaches to&#13;
ensure that the lending and advice we provide is what our clients really need. One conse-&#13;
quence of the reform process is of special note. Institutional change, encapsulated in the&#13;
Strategic Compact, has been given momentum by a joint commitment by management and&#13;
the board to enhance the latter's role in defining policy directions.&#13;
The Executive Board's unanimous approval of the Strategic Compact last March,&#13;
whereby investment in changes over the next two years will lead to a much stronger and&#13;

Strengthening social safety nets continues to&#13;
be a high Bank priority, particularly in the cis&#13;

and hence payroll taxes, resulted in a severe&#13;
erosion of cash benefits, such as pensions, un-&#13;

Well-functioning infrastructure services-es-     V&#13;
pecially electric power, transportation systems,&#13;
and telecommunications networks-are critical&#13;
for the growth of internationally competitive&#13;
private sectors. Despite heavy past investment,&#13;
much of the region's infrastructure is unable to&#13;
provide the levels of service that industry needs.&#13;
Meanwhile, government budgets are increas-&#13;
ingly constrained, both by the nieed to maintain &#13;
fiscal balances and by new demands for expen-&#13;
ditures in other areas, such as human resources&#13;

private financing with a $ 100 mnillion guarantee&#13;

the Bank also made a $65 million loan). This&#13;

the transfer of SDR 416 million from the IBRD'S&#13;

other income. Of the latter amount, SDR 1,750&#13;

SDR 783 million in the release of donor contri-&#13;

a. World Bank Atlas methodology; per capita GNP figures are in 1996 US. dollars.&#13;
b. Countries are eligible for IDA on the basis of (a) relative poverty and (b) lack of creditworthiness. The operational cutofffor iDA eligi-&#13;
bility for Fr98 is a 1996 GNP per capita of $925, usingAtlas methodology. To receive IDA resources, countries also meet tests of perfor-&#13;
mance. In exceptional circumstances, IDA extends eligibility temporarily to countries that are above the operational cutoff and are&#13;
undertaking major adjustment efforts but are not creditworthy for IBRD lending. An exception has also been made for small island&#13;
economies (see footnote c).&#13;
c. During the IDA-1I period (Fe97-99), an exception to the GNP per capita operational cutofffor IDA eligibility ($925 for Fe98) has been&#13;
made for specific small island economies, which otherwise would have little or no access to Bank Group assistance because they lack&#13;
creditworthiness. For such countries, IDA funding is considered case by case for the financing of projects and adjustment programs&#13;
designed to strengthen creditworthiness.&#13;

operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted account-&#13;
ing principles in the United States and with Intemational Accounting Standards. These financial state-&#13;
ments are the responsibility of management of the International Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our&#13;
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing&#13;
standards, including International Standards on Auditing, which require that we plan and perform the&#13;

sures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates&#13;
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our&#13;
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.&#13;

We have audited the special purpose Statement of Sources and Applications of Development Resources as&#13;
of June 30, 1997 and 1996, the Summary Statement of Development Credits and the Statement of Voting&#13;
Power, and Subscriptions and Contributions as of June 30, 1997, and the related special purpose Statements&#13;
of Changes in Accumulated Surplus and of Cash Flows for the years ended June 30, 1997 and 1996,&#13;
expressed in terms of United States dollars, of the International Development Association (IDA), which&#13;
appear on pages 220 through 238 of this Report. These financial statements are the responsibility of man-&#13;
agement. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including International&#13;
Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable&#13;
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes&#13;
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An&#13;
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,&#13;
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a rea-&#13;
sonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
The special purpose financial statements were prepared to reflect the sources and applications of develop-&#13;
ment resources and the development credits, voting power, and subscriptions and contributions of IDA to&#13;
comply with Article VI, Section 11 (a) of the Articles of Agreement of IDA as described in Note A, and are&#13;
not intended to be a presentation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United&#13;
States or with International Accounting Standards.&#13;
In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material&#13;
respects, in terms of United States dollars, the sources and applications of development resources as of&#13;
June 30, 1997 and 1996, the development credits, voting power, and subscriptions and contributions of&#13;
IDA at June 30, 1997 and the changes in its accumulated surplus and its cash flows for the years ended&#13;
June 30, 1997 and 1996, on the basis of accounting described in Note A.&#13;
This report is intended solely for the information of the Board of Governors, management and members of&#13;
IDA. However, under IDA's Articles of Agreement, this report is a matter of public record and its distribu-&#13;

President and Board of Governors&#13;
International Development Association,&#13;
as Administrator of the Interim Trust Fund&#13;
We have audited the special purpose Statement of Sources and Applications of Development Resources, the Sum-&#13;
mary Statement of Interim Fund Credits, and the Statement of Contributions as of June 30, 1997, and the related&#13;
special purpose Statements of Changes in Accumulated Surplus and of Cash Flows for the year ended June 30,&#13;
1997, expressed in terms of United States dollars, of the Interim Trust Fund, which appear on pages 241 through&#13;
247 of this Report. These financial statements are the responsibility of management. Our responsibility is to&#13;
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.&#13;
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including International Stan-&#13;
dards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance&#13;
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test&#13;
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assess-&#13;
ing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall&#13;
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
The special purpose financial statements were prepared to reflect the sources and applications of development&#13;
resources and the Interim Fund Credits, and contributions of the Interim Trust Fund to comply with Section 2(e)&#13;
of the Board of Governors' Resolution of International Development Association (IDA) and Article VI, Section&#13;
I I (a) of the Articles of Agreement as described in Note A, and are not intended to be a presentation in conformity&#13;
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States or with International Accounting Standards.&#13;
In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, in&#13;
terms of United States dollars, the sources and applications of development resources, and the Interim Fund Cred-&#13;
its, and contributions of the Interim Trust Fund at June 30, 1997 and the changes in its accumulated surplus and&#13;
its cash flows for the year then ended, on the basis of accounting described in Note A.&#13;
This report is intended solely for the information of the Board of Governors, IDA's management as Administrator&#13;
of the Interim Trust Fund, contributors to and borrowers from the Interim Trust Fund, and members of IDA.&#13;
However, under IDA's Board of Governors' Resolution establishing the Interim Trust Fund, this report is included&#13;
in the Annual Report of the Executive Directors to the Board of Governors of IDA and is therefore a matter of&#13;
public record and its distribution is not limited.&#13;

            This Annual Report, covering July 1,
            1996 to June 30, 1997, chronicles a year of renewal at the
            World Bank. Strengthening partnerships and getting results
            in serving the poorest people in the world are two recurring
            themes running through the report.  These two objectives are
            illustrated in the strengthened working relationship being
            forged between management and staff and the Executive
            Directors. One of the year's most significant
            achievements was the initiative to address the debt of the
            heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs), which combines
            powerful partnerships to meet new needs, using nonlending
            and lending services with funding drawn from the Bank as
            well as other partners.  Another was the Executive
            Board's unanimous approval of Strategic Compact in
            March 1997. The board will have an integral role in
            monitoring the Strategic Compact.  This investment in
            changes will lead to much stronger and cost-effective
            institution in the future, and is an important step in
            further strengthening the relationship between the Bank and
            its shareholders.
