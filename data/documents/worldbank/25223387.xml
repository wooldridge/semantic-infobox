                        FOR THE SAVA RIVER BASIN&#13;
&#13;
1          INTRODUCTION&#13;
This report provides a description of the development of a hydrologic model for the Sava River Basin&#13;
(SRB) that is one of the main components of the Water and Climate Adaptation Plan (WATCAP) be-&#13;
ing prepared by the Consultant for the International Sava River Basin Commission (ISRBC) under&#13;
World Bank funding.1&#13;
&#13;
Development of a hydrologic model that should be used to assess the hydrologic response of the&#13;
SRB to future climate scenarios is one of the key steps in establishing the WATCAP for this basin.&#13;
Predicting hydrologic response over a different range of climate scenarios will be of crucial im-&#13;
portance for the future development of the SRB. It will enable ISRBC to make adequate plans and be&#13;
better prepared for future adaptation and mitigation measures.&#13;

This model is the basis of the analysis of climate change impacts on specific water management sec-&#13;
tors (navigation, hydropower, flood control, and irrigation) and as such should be able to simulate the&#13;
hydrologic regime adequately on a 10-day or monthly time scale.&#13;

The Sava River Basin (Figure 2) is a major drainage basin of the South Eastern Europe covering the&#13;
total area of approximately 96,000 km2 (Prohaska, 2009). The Sava River is the second largest tribu-&#13;
tary to the Danube River by catchment area, and has the largest water discharge to the Danube of all&#13;
tributaries. The Sava River flows from the highest Slovenian Alps on the north-west toward conflu-&#13;
ence with Danube on the east in total length of 990 km (ISRBC, 2009). The basin is asymmetric, with&#13;
much more developed river network on the south (right tributaries) than on the north (left tributaries).&#13;
Major tributaries are the right tributaries: Kupa, Una, Vrbas, Bosna, and Drina rivers, with basin areas&#13;
ranging from about 7,000 km2 (Vrbas) to 20,000 km2 (Drina). Average discharge of the Sava River at&#13;
the confluence with Danube in Belgrade is 1700 m3/s, which results in average runoff yield of 18&#13;
L/s/km2.&#13;

&#13;
A hydrologic model of the whole Sava River basin has never been developed before, not even in the&#13;
former Yugoslavia. The most noteworthy modelling efforts have been made in Slovenia for their part&#13;
of the Sava River basin. Initially, Republic Hydro-meteorological Service of Slovenia (2001) developed&#13;
a model in the WMS (Watershed Management System) environment, based on the Hydrologic Engi-&#13;
neering Centre - Hydrologic Modelling System (HEC-HMS) model, for the Sava River down to the&#13;
Zidani Most station.2 The WMS environment was later abandoned and the HBV model3 was used&#13;
(e.g. Kobold and Brilly, 2006; PrimoÅ¾iÄ&#141; et al, 2008), but the primary purpose of the model was flood&#13;
forecasting. A rainfall-runoff model for the Vrbas basin was developed using the HEC-HMS software&#13;
within the scope of the Update of the Water Resources Management Basis for the Vrbas River basin&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
This report presents development of the hydrologic model for the SRB and represents one of the prin-&#13;
cipal tasks of the WATCAP project. The scope of work related to model development included the fol-&#13;
lowing tasks:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢     Perform an analysis and make the selection of the meteorological and hydrological stations from&#13;
      which the data will be collected and used for the modelling;&#13;
â&#128;¢     Collect and analyse data needed for the model (meteorological, hydrological, digital terrain&#13;
      model, land use, etc.);&#13;
â&#128;¢     Set-up the model, including calibration and verification;&#13;
â&#128;¢     Using the observed and modelled hydrologic and meteorological data, create scenario forecasts&#13;
      for each of the gauges within the basin and create simulation forecasts;&#13;
â&#128;¢     Complete a hydrologic model that will be used in simulation and planning purposes that will allow&#13;
      the users to make decisions with future scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
This report describes work done on data collection, model setup, calibration and verification, and also&#13;
gives the results of simulations with future climate scenarios. The SRB is described to a high detail in&#13;
the Sava River Basin Analysis Report4 published by ISRBC (2009), while a systematic overview of nu-&#13;
merous previous studies of the hydrologic regime of the Sava River and its tributaries has been com-&#13;
piled by Prohaska (2009). Development of climate scenarios has been prepared by other consultants&#13;
and is presented in a separate report (VujadinoviÄ&#135; and VukoviÄ&#135;, 2013).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2          PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS FOR MODEL DEVELOPMENT&#13;
&#13;
2.1        Selection of the model&#13;
The decision to use HEC-HMS (USACE, 2010) as the modelling platform for development of the hy-&#13;
drologic model of the Sava basin has been made in agreement with the ISRBC for two reasons. First,&#13;
a preliminary HEC-HMS model for the Sava basin had already been developed and initially calibrated&#13;
by USACE in the course of development of the unsteady hydraulic model of the Sava River with the&#13;
HEC-RAS (River Analysis System) software (USACE, 2011). Second, an HEC-HMS model could eas-&#13;
ily be disseminated to the relevant users in the riparian countries since the HMS software can be ob-&#13;
tained free of charge. In the case of general poor data availability in the Sava basin, HEC-HMS has&#13;
an advantage of having low data requirements. The main disadvantage is that HEC-HMS is not com-&#13;
pletely suitable for continuous simulation of large basins since it has originally been developed for es-&#13;
timating flood hydrographs from smaller basins.&#13;
&#13;
HEC-HMS models runoff in 5 steps. It calculates (1) interception, (2) surface detention, (3) infiltration,&#13;
(4) direct runoff, and (5) baseflow. For a basin divided into sub-basins, routing the outflow hydrograph&#13;
from a sub-basin toward downstream nodes of the river network is also necessary. Different methods&#13;
can be applied in each step, but not all the methods are applicable for continuous simulation.&#13;
Two main decisions related to the model have to be made before actual modelling and corresponding&#13;
data collection can begin. These are:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢     definition of sub-basins within the basin, and&#13;
â&#128;¢     choice of computational time step.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                                             Page 4&#13;

DevelopmentÂ ofÂ theÂ HydrologicÂ ModelÂ forÂ theÂ SavaÂ RiverÂ BasinÂ Â &#13;
Â &#13;
These two problems are interrelated. Basin subdivision into sub-basins should be made in such a&#13;
manner to include all locations at which description of the water regime is needed, but also to include&#13;
locations of hydrologic gauging stations where reliable observed data is available for model calibration&#13;
and verification. On the other hand, computational time step should be chosen so that it enables good&#13;
temporal representation of hydrologic processes in the basin, but it is generally related to the size of&#13;
sub-basin (smaller basin size requires shorter time step and vice versa). Finally, choice of the compu-&#13;
tational time step dictates temporal resolution of the model input data.&#13;
&#13;
In case of the SRB, computational time step of 1 day was initially chosen for modelling since this is&#13;
the longest possible time step in HEC-HMS. However, a 12-hour time step was later adopted to re-&#13;
solve the issues related to precipitation data representation (measured from 7 am one day to 7 am&#13;
next day, in contrast to flow and temperature measurements that are averaged over 0-24 hour period)&#13;
and to enable more realistic hydrologic routing on smaller sub-basins.&#13;
&#13;
Basin subdivision was made with respect to daily time step (sub-basin sizes approximately from 2000&#13;
to 5000 km2) and to data availability and quality (i.e. reliable measurements, no gaps). Priority was&#13;
generally given to stations recommended by riparian experts hired by the World Bank5. In fact, basin&#13;
subdivision had to be made in two phases: after initial subdivision and request for data, final subdivi-&#13;
sion was made in accordance with available hydrologic and meteorological data.&#13;
&#13;
It should be mentioned here that the preliminary hydrologic model mentioned above and developed&#13;
by USACE could not have been used. This model was developed as the event-based model, aimed at&#13;
simulating flood runoff hydrographs from rainfall events with very fine temporal resolution of 15&#13;
minutes. The modelling methods chosen for this model were not suitable for continuous simulation&#13;
aimed at future climate analysis that is the main goal of this project. These methods did not include&#13;
interception and surface losses and the snow melt procedure; also, they included soil loss method&#13;
(â&#128;&#156;Initial and Constantâ&#128;&#157;) that is not applicable for continuous simulation. The USACE model was cali-&#13;
brated against statistically derived design rainfall and flows (of 50 and 100 years return period) in ab-&#13;
sence of the observed sub-daily data on rainfall and flows. In contrast, a continuous hydrologic model&#13;
needs to be built on the continuous time series of precipitation and temperatures, with a time scale&#13;
not shorter than one day. In addition, the division of the Sava basin into the sub-basins applied in this&#13;
model did not include sub-basins related to additional hydrologic stations needed for this study.&#13;
Therefore, virtually none of the elements of the USACE model could have been retained for develop-&#13;
ment of the hydrologic model for continuous runoff simulation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.2        Data collection&#13;
The principal input data for the model is: daily precipitation, daily air temperatures, and monthly poten-&#13;
tial evapotranspiration. In addition to the meteorological input, hydrologic data (daily flows) is needed&#13;
for calibration and verification purposes.&#13;
&#13;
Data for the Sava hydrologic model were collected from several sources. Part of the required hydro-&#13;
meteorological data was available from previous work undertaken by the World Bank on the WATCAP&#13;
project on the analysis of statistical trends at 33 meteorological and 38 hydrologic stations over the&#13;
Sava basin (Tables A1, A2 and A3 in Appendix A) (World Bank 2011).&#13;
Additional data collection was performed by five experts from riparian countries. Data requested from&#13;
riparian countries generally consist of:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢     hydrologic data at selected stations and in selected periods (daily flow rates),&#13;
â&#128;¢     precipitation and air temperature data at selected meteorological stations (daily data),&#13;
&#13;
5Â IndividualÂ contractsÂ wereÂ madeÂ betweenÂ WorldÂ BankÂ andÂ riparianÂ expertsÂ inÂ Slovenia,Â Croatia,Â BosniaÂ andÂ HerzegovinaÂ (oneÂ withÂ Fedâ&#128;&#144;&#13;
&#13;
erationÂ ofÂ BiHÂ andÂ oneÂ withÂ RepublikaÂ Srpska)Â andÂ Serbia.Â Â DataÂ fromÂ MontenegroÂ wasÂ obtainedÂ directlyÂ fromÂ theÂ Hydroâ&#128;&#144;&#13;
meteorologicalÂ instituteÂ directlyÂ byÂ ISRBC.Â &#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                            Page 5&#13;

Â &#13;
â&#128;¢    potential evapotranspiration data at selected stations (monthly data),&#13;
â&#128;¢    data on water control facilities in the Sava River basin.&#13;
&#13;
Data gathered by riparian experts is listed in Tables A4 and A5 in Appendix A. The experts collected&#13;
additional data at stations already available from the World Bank trends report and data for additional&#13;
hydrologic and meteorological stations. Data from Montenegro needed for the Drina River basin part&#13;
of the SRB was obtained by courtesy of the Hydro-meteorological service of Montenegro via ISRBC&#13;
(these stations are included in Table A5 in Appendix A). A small amount of data for the Vrbas River&#13;
basin was used from the Vrbas Study project (COWI, 2012).&#13;
&#13;
Locations of all hydrologic and meteorological stations for which any data has been collected are&#13;
shown in Figures A1 and A2 in Appendix A.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 3 shows number of hydrologic and meteorological (precipitation and temperature) stations with&#13;
data collected and stored in the project database. A major drawback is lack of data from Croatia and&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war and post-war period between 1991 and 2005. Because of&#13;
general poor availability of digitized meteorological data in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the period pri-&#13;
or to 1990, precipitation and temperature data were obtained only for two 5-year periods selected for&#13;
model calibration and verification (1969-1974 and 1979-1984); hence the drop for precipitation and&#13;
temperature data in mid 1970s in Figure 3.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ISRBC provided digital elevation model (DEM) of the basin in raster format. The DEM is based on&#13;
SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission; Farr et al., 2007) data with a horizontal resolution of ap-&#13;
proximately 85 m. ISRBC also provided input and output data for the HEC-HMS model developed by&#13;
USACE. This data also included a 30-m DEM and two products of this DEM created in HEC-GeoHMS&#13;
for the USACE model, namely the river network and sub-basin delineation vectors. However, these&#13;
two products could not have been used. The river network, produced by automatic procedures for&#13;
stream recognition in HEC-GeoHMS (ArcView), has significant departures from the true network. New&#13;
river vectors were therefore digitized from the 1:250,000 maps. The basin subdivision created by an&#13;
automatic delineation procedure in HEC-GeoHMS was only partially used for locations that are com-&#13;
mon to previous USACE basin subdivision and the new one made in this project. In addition, the&#13;
USACE automatic delineation has proved inaccurate in the plains of the Sava River valley since the&#13;
river channels generated from DEM did not correspond to the true channels, especially for the most&#13;
downstream parts of the major tributaries Una, Vrbas, Bosna, and Drina. At these locations sub-basin&#13;
boundaries were corrected manually. Sub-basins obtained in this way were used to develop eleva-&#13;
tion-area relationships that are required for the snow melt module of the model. However, sub-basin&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                              Page 6&#13;

Â &#13;
areas were not defined from this delineation, but from official information provided by national hydro-&#13;
meteorological services via the riparian experts and from information given by Prohaska (2009).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.3        Selection of the calibration and verification periods&#13;
Having in mind the number of stations for which calibration had to be made and a large number of the&#13;
model parameters involved in calibration, it was concluded that it would be reasonable to select two 5-&#13;
year periods for calibration and verification. Poor data availability in the Sava Basin after 1990 sug-&#13;
gested that calibration and verification periods should be selected prior to this year, i.e. from the&#13;
standard climatological period 1961-1990. The basic idea was to seek for 5-year periods between&#13;
1961 and 1990 in which hydrologic regime could be considered representative or â&#128;&#156;averageâ&#128;&#157;. A prelim-&#13;
inary analysis of hydrologic regimes at 63 hydrologic stations in the Sava Basin had shown that the&#13;
departures of 5-year mean flows from the overall 1961-1990 mean are the smallest in the period&#13;
1970-1974, followed by the periods 1979-1983, 1969-1973, 1973-1977, and 1980-1984. The final&#13;
choice of the calibration and verification periods is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢     Calibration: 5 hydrologic years from October 1979 to September 1984;&#13;
â&#128;¢     Verification: 5 hydrologic years from October 1969 to September 1974.&#13;
&#13;
The initial idea was to have a second verification period (2005-2010) that would reflect recent condi-&#13;
tions within the basin, but this was abandoned due to poor data availability in this period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.4        Record extension&#13;
The decision to run the model for the complete 1961-1990 period was made at the meeting of 17th&#13;
January 2013 in Zagreb, after the data collection procedure by the riparian experts was completed.6 It&#13;
was therefore agreed that additional data collection would result in long delays and that a more prac-&#13;
tical approach would be to extend the existing record to cover the 1961-1990 period. A total of 29 pre-&#13;
cipitation records and 13 temperature records needed extension, while an additional 30 precipitation&#13;
stations and 23 temperature stations with complete record were used for the record reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
Filling in the missing observations and extension of short records of daily precipitation and tempera-&#13;
tures was based on the application of a regional climate model. The idea behind the record recon-&#13;
struction is the following: if the meteorological parameters are represented by spatially continuous&#13;
fields in the atmosphere, then the observations can be seen as the values of meteorological parame-&#13;
ters sampled in points at synoptic, climatological or precipitation stations. The problem is then how to&#13;
reconstruct these parameter fields from a set of discrete (point) measurements. This reconstruction is&#13;
made using a three-dimensional non-hydrostatic mesoscale model (NHMM) developed in Republic&#13;
Hydro-meteorological Service of Serbia on the basis of the FITNAH model7, but adapted for local cli-&#13;
mate conditions by taking into account large scale processes, mesoscale meteorological parameters&#13;
and local orography. For reconstruction of daily precipitation and temperature records in the SRB, the&#13;
NHMM model was used with horizontal resolution of 1 km by 1 km. The model was calibrated against&#13;
data from 10 synoptic stations and verified on the remaining available data over the whole period. The&#13;
verification has shown that the record reconstruction produced satisfactory results except for some&#13;
underestimation of precipitation at stations in the Montenegrin part of the Drina River basin (part of&#13;
the SRB). This is because the applied model could not perform well in the mountainous region such&#13;
as the upper Drina basin without proper boundary conditions. However, subsequent hydrologic simu-&#13;
lations proved that this uncertainty did not affect the modelling process significantly.&#13;

3         MODEL SETUP&#13;
&#13;
3.1       Basin subdivision&#13;
For the modelling purposes, the complete Sava River basin is divided into sub-basins. Two levels of&#13;
division are made. On the first level, 14 major sub-basins are defined (Figure 4 and Table 1):&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢     the upper Sava in Slovenia (01) and major tributaries (Kupa, Una, Vrbas, Bosna, Drina, Kolubara&#13;
      rivers; odd numbers from 03 to 13);&#13;
â&#128;¢     sub-basins along the Sava valley between the major tributaries (even numbers from 02 to 14).&#13;
&#13;
Figure 4 shows major sub-basins in different colours, as indicated in the legend. Major sub-basins are&#13;
modelled separately and linked sequentially for joint simulations.&#13;
The second level of division is also shown in Figure 5. A complete list of the second-level sub-basins&#13;
is given in Table 2. The total number of sub-basins is 44, of which 35 are controlled by hydrologic sta-&#13;
tions at the outlet.&#13;

3.2       HEC-HMS setup&#13;
3.2.1 Model structure&#13;
A HEC-HMS project consists of basin models, meteorological models and control specifications. A&#13;
basin model serves to define elements of the basin (such as sub-basins, reaches and junctions), and&#13;
runoff computation method for each element. A meteorological model is used to define methods for&#13;
calculation of basin precipitation, snow melt and potential evapotranspiration. Control specifications&#13;
are used to define the time window for computation. To perform a simulation run, these three compo-&#13;
nents need to be specified.&#13;
&#13;
The Sava Basin hydrologic model is built with 14 separate basin models representing major sub-&#13;
basins as listed in Table 1. The model is implemented in this manner to allow application of different&#13;
meteorological models to each basin. This is particularly important for the snowmelt and evapotran-&#13;
spiration representation. If the whole Sava Basin had been described with one basin model in HEC-&#13;
HMS, only one set of snowmelt parameters and one set of potential evapotranspiration data could&#13;
have been used.&#13;
&#13;
Fourteen basin models consist of odd-numbered basins representing upper Sava in Slovenia and ma-&#13;
jor tributaries (Kupa, Una, Vrbas, Bosna, Drina and Kolubara rivers), and even-numbered basins that&#13;
represent the Sava Basin parts between the major tributaries. Figure 6 shows the HEC-HMS typical&#13;
interface with the list of basin models in the left pane, with the second basin model selected so that its&#13;
elements are displayed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Figure 6: Basin models of the Sava project in HEC-HMS are listed in the left pane. Right pane shows elements of the&#13;
              second basin model.&#13;
The basin models are linked using the source elements in the even-numbered basins. A source ele-&#13;
ment is used to represent boundary conditions to the basin model. For example, the selected basin&#13;
model in Figure 6, named â&#128;&#156;02_Sava to Kupaâ&#128;&#157;, is the part of the Sava basin from the Ä&#140;ateÅ¾ hydrologic&#13;
station to the confluence with the Kupa River. The first element in this basin model is â&#128;&#156;Source-01â&#128;&#157;,&#13;
which represents inflow to this basin from basin â&#128;&#156;01_Sloveniaâ&#128;&#157;. This inflow is routed via the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                               Page 11&#13;

station. The same junction receives runoff from the â&#128;&#156;02_S1_Zagrebâ&#128;&#157; sub-basin element. Routed inflow&#13;
and the sub-basin runoff are added in the junction, to be routed downstream by the â&#128;&#156;02_R2_Zagreb-&#13;
UsceKupeâ&#128;&#157; reach. Outflow from this reach and runoff from the â&#128;&#156;02_S2_UsceKupeâ&#128;&#157; sub-basin are&#13;
added in the final â&#128;&#156;02_J2_Sava to Kupaâ&#128;&#157; junction. Outflow from this final junction is later used as the&#13;
inflow to the downstream â&#128;&#156;04_Sava from Kupa to Unaâ&#128;&#157; basin model. Similarly, outflow from every last&#13;
junction in other basin models becomes a source in the corresponding downstream basin model, thus&#13;
enabling the basins to be linked.&#13;
&#13;

              output data (bottom right).&#13;
The source elements are implemented in HEC-HMS so that they can produce a constant flow or flow&#13;
from a discharge gauge. In case when a source element represents a contributing area in a separate&#13;
basin model, this discharge gauge is just a formal way to associate the simulated outflow from anoth-&#13;
er basin model with the source element. To accomplish this, the Discharge Gage option is selected&#13;
(Figure 7 left) and a discharge gauge specified (Figure 7 top right), while the gauge is defined with&#13;
outflow data from the output file of the other basin model (Figure 7 bottom right). The complete list of&#13;
model elements is given in Appendix B.&#13;
&#13;
A consequence of having multiple basin models is that multiple simulation runs have to be made.&#13;
These simulations have to be run in sequence from the most upstream basin to the most downstream&#13;
one to enable correct computations. This is easily accomplished by using the Multiple Compute dialog&#13;
box in HEC-HMS.&#13;

The following methods for continuous runoff modelling in HEC-HMS are used in each basin model&#13;

â&#128;¢    Muskingum method or Lag method for hydrograph routing along reaches.&#13;
&#13;
The Soil Moisture Accounting (SMA) loss method was also considered, but was abandoned due to&#13;
the large number of parameters required and poor data availability.&#13;
&#13;
The constant monthly base flow method was used for sub-basins where the recession method could&#13;
not provide good agreement of simulated runoff with the observed data in the calibration process.&#13;
This is mostly the case of sub-basins with significant presence of karst in geological structure, which&#13;
usually produces a complex watershed response that cannot be modelled with simple methods such&#13;
as the exponential recession or the linear reservoir.&#13;
&#13;
The lag routing method was used for short reaches for which the Muskingum method could not be&#13;
applied because the 12-hour time step did not allow stable numerical computation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
3.2.3 Meteorological modelling methods&#13;
Different meteorological models were defined for each basin model to enable application of different&#13;
parameters for snow melt and potential evapotranspiration.&#13;
&#13;
Precipitation for each sub-basin in the Sava Basin model is determined as a weighted average of pre-&#13;
cipitation at gauge locations (the Gage Weights method in HEC-HMS). The weights were initially es-&#13;
timated using the Thiessen polygons method, but were later adjusted during the calibration process to&#13;
obtain the best possible agreement of simulated and observed flows.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   Page 13&#13;

DevelopmentÂ ofÂ theÂ HydrologicÂ ModelÂ forÂ theÂ SavaÂ RiverÂ BasinÂ Â &#13;
Â &#13;
The snow melt is calculated with the Temperature Index method, which is the only method available&#13;
in HEC-HMS. Most of the parameters of this method are defined on the level of the basin model (i.e.&#13;
on the level of the major Sava sub-basins). Each sub-basin within the basin model can use a different&#13;
temperature gauge data and different parameters including the temperature gradient and distribution&#13;
of elevation bands in the sub-basin with different initial snowmelt conditions.&#13;
&#13;
Potential evapotranspiration (PET) can be calculated in HEC-HMS using the Priestley-Taylor method&#13;
or specified with the Constant Monthly method. In addition to the temperature data, the Priestley-&#13;
Taylor method requires data on solar radiation, which was not available. The Constant Monthly meth-&#13;
od uses a fixed pattern of monthly PET that can be estimated outside HEC-HMS, and it was therefore&#13;
suitable for use in the Sava Basin modelling. Each sub-basin in the basin model can have different&#13;
Constant Monthly PET.&#13;
&#13;
The model uses 48 precipitation stations and 27 temperature stations, as noted in the last column of&#13;
Table A5 of Appendix A. These stations are also listed in Table B2 of Appendix B. In addition to 48&#13;
regular precipitation stations, Table B2 indicates two more stations included in the model. These are&#13;
artificial stations with transformed data from two regular stations that are formally used in HEC-HMS&#13;
for achieving better results. First, precipitation from the Celje meteorological station shifted backwards&#13;
in time (for 36 hours) was used for the 01_S5 subbasin of the Savinja River because there was no&#13;
other appropriate precipitation station for this subbasin. The Celje station is located at very down-&#13;
stream part of this sub-basin and actually proved well in calibration except that the simulated hydro-&#13;
graph had significant delay behind the observed one. Since there was no other precipitation data&#13;
available from stations within this sub-basin, the time-shifted Celje precipitation was used and was&#13;
denoted in the model as the â&#128;&#156;Celje -36hâ&#128;&#157; precipitation gauge. Similarly, precipitation for the 05_S5&#13;
subbasin of the Una River was taken as reduced precipitation from the Novi Grad meteorological sta-&#13;
tion by factor 0.88. Again, no other precipitation station could produce satisfactory results in the cali-&#13;
bration phase in terms of the runoff dynamics, while the precipitation data from the Novi Grad station&#13;
provided fair simulated runoff dynamics but produced overestimated runoff. Specifying a weight less&#13;
than 1 to a single precipitation station on a subbasin is meaningless because HMS would rescale it to&#13;
1. Therefore, the reduced precipitation from the Novi Grad station was used as the â&#128;&#156;Novi Grad x 0.88â&#128;&#157;&#13;
precipitation gauge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4         MODEL CALIBRATION AND VERIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
4.1       Control hydrologic stations&#13;
Calibration and verification of the hydrologic model of the Sava River basin was performed for two pe-&#13;
riods, each having duration of five hydrologic years:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢     Calibration: from October 1979 to September 1984;&#13;
â&#128;¢     Verification: from October 1969 to September 1974.&#13;
&#13;
The complete Sava basin model was calibrated against observed daily flow data at 35 hydrologic sta-&#13;
tions. Out of these 35 stations, five were excluded from evaluation. Three stations (Pliva @ Volari,&#13;
Vrbas @ BoÄ&#141;ac and Drina @ FoÄ&#141;a Nizvodno) had incomplete records in both calibration and verifica-&#13;
tion periods. One more station (Drina @ Radalj) has incomplete record in the verification period.&#13;
Moreover, data from stations Pliva @ Volari and Vrbas @ BoÄ&#141;ac is considered unreliable since nu-&#13;
merous errors were discovered in the record. Data from the Vrbas @ Han Skela station is also found&#13;
to be unreliable and was therefore excluded despite the complete record. Model performance in the&#13;
calibration and verification periods is presented for the remaining 30 stations.&#13;
&#13;
Additional verification was conducted for model simulations with the extended input data records in&#13;
the 1961-1990 period. Complete historical streamflow record for 1961-1990 was available only for 19&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       Page 14&#13;

Â &#13;
stations. Five stations excluded from evaluation in the calibration and verification periods were ex-&#13;
cluded here as well. Incomplete records from the remaining 11 stations for 1961-1990 are generally&#13;
longer than 20 years, and these stations are not excluded from evaluation for this period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.2       Model performance criteria&#13;
Evaluation of the model performance is typically based on specific statistics and ratings developed to&#13;
evaluate (or penalize) various performance criteria, such as accuracy of predicting peak flows, total&#13;
hydrograph volume, peak flow, time to peak etc., depending on project goals. For this project and the&#13;
model intended to perform long-term simulations of present and future hydrologic regime, the goal is&#13;
to predict the long-term mean flows on monthly and annual scale with reasonable accuracy. The fol-&#13;
lowing measures are used to assess performance of the Sava Basin model.&#13;
&#13;
    (1) Percentage error (bias) in long-term mean annual flow, defined as:&#13;
&#13;
                     | Q sim ï&#128;­ Q obs |&#13;
             PBIAS ï&#128;½                   ï&#131;&#151; 100 (%)&#13;
                           Q obs&#13;
&#13;
      where Q sim and Q obs are simulated and observed mean flows, respectively. This measure re-&#13;
      flects the modelâ&#128;&#153;s capability to maintain water balance by reproducing total runoff volume. The&#13;
      lower PBIAS, the better is the modelâ&#128;&#153;s performance.&#13;
&#13;
    (2) Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             NSE ï&#128;½ 1 ï&#128;­&#13;
                       ï&#131;¥ (Q       i&#13;
                                   sim&#13;
                                         ï&#128;­ Qiobs ) 2&#13;
                       ï&#131;¥ (Q       i&#13;
                                   obs&#13;
                                         ï&#128;­ Q obs ) 2&#13;
&#13;
               sim        obs&#13;
      where Qi       and Qi     are simulated and observed flows at time step i, respectively, and Q obs is&#13;
      observed mean flow. The NSE coefficient determines the relative magnitude of the error variance&#13;
      compared to the observed data variance, and essentially represents the percentage of observed&#13;
      data variance explained by the model. NSE takes values in range between â&#136;&#146;â&#136;&#158; and 1; value of 1&#13;
      indicates a perfect agreement, while negative values indicate very poor agreement. The NSE co-&#13;
      efficient is evaluated for the monthly and daily time steps.&#13;
&#13;
    (3) Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in long-term mean monthly flows:&#13;
&#13;
                                  sim&#13;
                          1 12 | Qm   ï&#128;­ Qmobs&#13;
                                              |&#13;
             MAPE ï&#128;½         ï&#131;¥&#13;
                         12 m ï&#128;½1    Qmobs&#13;
                                                ï&#131;&#151; 100 (%)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               sim        obs&#13;
      where Qm and Qm are simulated and observed long-term mean monthly flows in month m, re-&#13;
      spectively. This measure is introduced here to evaluate differences in simulated long-term mean&#13;
      seasonal flow distribution compared to the observed one. Lower values of MAPE indicate better&#13;
      agreement.&#13;
&#13;
Although there are no generally accepted criteria for model evaluation in terms of the accuracy of&#13;
simulated flow compared to measured data, the performance ratings given by Moriasi et al. (2007),&#13;
based on the ratings and corresponding values reported from individual studies, are used here to&#13;
evaluate quality of the fit. The ratings for NSE and PBIAS are shown in Table 3. In general, a model&#13;
simulation can be judged as satisfactory if NSE &gt; 0.50 and if PBIAS &lt; Â±25% for stream flow.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                             Page 15&#13;

4.3       Calibration and verification results&#13;
Examples of calibration results at three selected stations along the Sava River are shown in Figure 9.&#13;
The graphs show simulated vs. observed mean monthly flows for 5 water years during the calibration&#13;
period. The results for the verification period at the same stations are shown in Figure 10. Complete&#13;
results for all stations are given in Appendix C (calibration) and Appendix D (verification).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Figure 10: Validation results for the Sava hydrologic model for selected stations.&#13;
Simulated vs. observed seasonal distribution of flows at selected stations are shown in Figure 11.&#13;
These are examples with fairly good agreement. The results for all 30 stations are given in Appendix&#13;
E (calibration) and Appendix F (verification). At all stations one can generally notice spring underesti-&#13;
mation and summer/autumn overestimation. Overestimation is due to the fact that HEC-HMS does&#13;
not account for evapotranspiration in time steps in which precipitation occurs. This creates problems&#13;
in modelling runoff from short-duration heavy precipitation events that usually take place in summer.&#13;
Such events typically last for several hours, and therefore it is unrealistic to neglect evaporation dur-&#13;
ing the same time step of 12 hours. HEC-HMS is mainly intended for simulations on smaller catch-&#13;
ments with shorter time step, e.g. hourly step, in which case it would be justified to neglect evapotran-&#13;
spiration. Therefore, in order to obtain a better fit in summer, precipitation station weights are calibrat-&#13;
ed so as to reduce the summer runoff, meaning that the overall basin precipitation is probably gener-&#13;
ally underestimated. However, this also results in spring underestimation. If the precipitation station&#13;
weights were chosen to obtain good fit in spring, the summer overestimation would be much more&#13;
pronounced.&#13;
&#13;
The percentage error in mean flows (PBIAS) is shown in Figure 12. This error is quite small in the cal-&#13;
ibration period (rating for PBIAS in the calibration period is â&#128;&#156;very goodâ&#128;&#157; for all stations). In the verifica-&#13;
tion period PBIAS is rated â&#128;&#156;very goodâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;goodâ&#128;&#157; at the majority of stations, whereas only five sta-&#13;
tions are rated â&#128;&#156;satisfactoryâ&#128;&#157;. The underestimation at Slovenian stations is due to the use of the con-&#13;
stant monthly baseflow method, i.e. the constant values of baseflow for each January, February etc.&#13;
that can be unrepresentative in some years. This method was nevertheless kept for further simula-&#13;
tions at Slovenian stations since it proved to be superior to the recession method. Stations on the&#13;
Bosna River and the DelibaÅ¡ino Selo station on the Vrbas River in BiH exhibit significant overestima-&#13;
tion in the verification period, but this overestimation is not conveyed downstream in any significant&#13;
amount. One of the reasons for this overestimation in the Bosna River basin could be that available&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                 Page 17&#13;

precipitation data is either not representative for the basin in question or is subject to errors. For&#13;

BoÄ&#141;ac reservoir or a problem with the hydrologic measurements.&#13;

The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficients for monthly flow series are shown in Figure 13. Val-&#13;
ues of about 0.8 achieved here in calibration for monthly values at the majority of stations (25 out of&#13;
30) are considered â&#128;&#156;very goodâ&#128;&#157; according to the ratings from Table 3. Five stations have NSE rated as&#13;
â&#128;&#156;goodâ&#128;&#157;. Results for the validation period generally give slightly lower NSE than for calibration, except&#13;
again at stations on the Bosna River, the DelibaÅ¡ino Selo station on the Vrbas River and the PodboÄ&#141;je&#13;
station on the Krka River which are unsatisfactory. The hydrologic regime of the Krka River is under&#13;
heavy influence of karst in the catchment.&#13;
A primary goal in model calibration was to achieve good model performance on the monthly time&#13;
scale, rather than for the computational time step of 12 hours or on a daily scale. The degree of&#13;
agreement of observed and simulated runoff on these shorter time scales varies from station to sta-&#13;
tion. Figure 14 presents NSE coefficients for daily flows at 30 selected hydrologic stations. Only three&#13;
stations exhibit NSE &lt; 0.5 in the calibration period, while significant deterioration in the validation pe-&#13;
riod is again at the stations on the Bosna River and the DelibaÅ¡ino Selo station on the Vrbas River. It&#13;
is interesting to notice that the quality of simulations at the PodboÄ&#141;je station on the Krka River in the&#13;
verification period is better on a daily scale than on the monthly scale, indicating that the model can&#13;

The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in long-term mean monthly flows, used to evaluate dif-&#13;
ferences in simulated long-term mean seasonal flow distribution compared to the observed one, is&#13;
shown in Figure 15. In the calibration period this measure ranges from 8% to 16%, with two excep-&#13;
tions for the PodboÄ&#141;je station on the Krka River and the Beli Brod station on the Kolubara River. Pos-&#13;
sible reasons for unsatisfactory model performance for the Krka @ PodboÄ&#141;je have already been men-&#13;
tioned. On the other hand, the Kolubara basin is very heterogeneous in terms of relief and geological&#13;
structure. There is also karst present in some of its sub-basins, but the major obstacle to better mod-&#13;
elling results seems to be unreliable precipitation data, especially during winter. The values of MAPE&#13;
are generally somewhat higher in the verification period, where again the worst results are attributed&#13;
to the Bosna River basin and the DelibaÅ¡ino Selo station on the Vrbas River. Since there are no rec-&#13;
ommended limits to assign ratings to the values of MAPE, based on the results from calibration period&#13;
and visual inspection of seasonal distributions shown in Appendix E, it could be assumed that the&#13;
MAPEs below 10% or 15% could be characterised as an acceptable model performance.&#13;

4.4       Verification of simulations with the extended record of input data&#13;
Precipitation and temperature data sets with missing data in the 1961-1990 period were extended to&#13;
enable model simulations for a complete 30-year climatological period. The actual simulations with&#13;
the extended record were performed for a time window from 1 September 1961 to 30 September&#13;
1990 to obtain 29 complete hydrologic years from October 1961 to September 1990. One additional&#13;
month (September 1961) was intended for the model warm up.&#13;
&#13;
The results of these simulations can be compared to the observed data at 19 hydrologic stations hav-&#13;
ing a complete historical streamflow record for 1961-1990. The remaining 11 stations used in calibra-&#13;
tion and verification have an incomplete record in this period, but are long enough (more than 20&#13;
years) to allow appropriate evaluation of model performance. In the following text, the evaluation is&#13;
given for all 30 stations, but the stations with incomplete records were marked to differentiate them&#13;
from those with complete records. As already mentioned, five stations excluded from evaluation in the&#13;
calibration and verification periods were excluded here as well.&#13;
&#13;
It should be noted that the evaluation of the model performance with input data from the extended&#13;
record actually includes evaluation of both the quality of the extended data sets in comparison to the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                          Page 20&#13;

Â &#13;
historical data and the quality of the hydrologic simulations. In other words, the uncertainties present&#13;
in the results can equally be attributed to uncertainty in input data and to the modelling uncertainty.&#13;
Three measures for model performance evaluation (percentage error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coeffi-&#13;
cient and average percentage error) for simulation with the extended record 1961-1990 are given in&#13;
Figure 16, Figure 17, and Figure 18. Each measure is compared to those from the calibration and ver-&#13;
ification periods. The error in the long-term water balance as reflected by PBIAS is generally smaller&#13;
for the whole 1961-1990 period than in the verification period 1969-1974 (Figure 16). The bias re-&#13;
mains relatively large at Slovenian stations, which exhibit underestimation of about 10%. It is interest-&#13;
ing to note that the large bias from the verification period at stations Krka @ PodboÄ&#141;je, Vrbas @&#13;
DelibaÅ¡ino Selo and the stations on the Bosna River has decreased to more acceptable values with&#13;
the extended input data. The only exception is the Bajina BaÅ¡ta station on the Drina River which ex-&#13;
hibits greater underestimation in this overall period than in the calibration and verification periods; this&#13;
is a consequence of underestimated precipitation in the Montenegrin part of the Drina River basin af-&#13;
ter the record extension, as already discussed in section 2.4.&#13;

Similar conclusions can be made from the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient for the simula-&#13;
tions with the extended record shown in Figure 17. In general, there is a slight deterioration of NSE&#13;
compared to the values of the verification period 1969-1974, while a relatively bad performance of the&#13;
Krka @ PodboÄ&#141;je, Vrbas @ DelibaÅ¡ino Selo, and stations on the Bosna River from the verification&#13;
period has improved over the longer period. However, NSE exceeds the limit of 0.5 for satisfactory&#13;
performance at all stations, which can be considered a success.&#13;
&#13;
The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) in long-term mean monthly flows are shown in Figure&#13;
18. The lowest values of MAPE range around 15%, which is assumed to be an acceptable perfor-&#13;
mance. However, almost half of the stations exhibit higher MAPE of about 20%, with the Beli Brod @&#13;
Kolubara station exceeding 30%.&#13;

5         MODEL APPLICATION WITH FUTURE CLIMATE SCENARIOS&#13;
&#13;
5.1       Methodology&#13;
Investigation of the climate change impacts on the water resources management in the SRB starts&#13;
with the simulations of the future hydrologic regime in the basin using the hydrologic model and the&#13;
projected climate from the Global Climate Models (GCMs) as the input. To assess the change in run-&#13;
off under climate change, the runoff simulated with future climate scenarios should be compared to&#13;
the runoff from some reference period, called baseline runoff.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                Page 22&#13;

DevelopmentÂ ofÂ theÂ HydrologicÂ ModelÂ forÂ theÂ SavaÂ RiverÂ BasinÂ Â &#13;
Â &#13;
Due to uncertainties that are attributed to the observed record extension and both climate and hydro-&#13;
logic modelling, the baseline runoff in this study is not the historically observed runoff, but the runoff&#13;
simulated with baseline climate scenarios from the GCMs. Runoff simulations with the hydrologic&#13;
model using the baseline and future scenarios provide the means to estimate the relative change ra-&#13;
ther than the absolute runoff values. The results therefore offer an insight into the range of potential&#13;
consequences of climate change on water resources at the basin scale.&#13;
&#13;
The results of the hydrologic simulations with baseline and future climate scenarios are used to de-&#13;
scribe changes in the hydrologic regime of the Sava River and its tributaries. The following indicators&#13;
of the hydrologic regime are considered to assess the change:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢      mean annual runoff, defined as the long-term average flow across years in a given 30-year&#13;
       period,&#13;
â&#128;¢      mean seasonal runoff, defined as the long-term average flow in four seasons across years in a&#13;
       given 30-year period,&#13;
â&#128;¢      high annual flow, defined as the annual flow with 10% probability of exceedance in a given 30-&#13;
       year period,&#13;
â&#128;¢      low annual flow, defined as the annual flow with 90% probability of exceedance in a given 30-&#13;
       year period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.2        Climate scenarios as the input to the hydrologic model&#13;
Having in mind the characteristics of the hydrologic model developed in the HEC-HMS framework,&#13;
future climate scenarios include daily precipitation and temperature data series and a typical seasonal&#13;
distribution of monthly potential evapotranspiration (PET) as an input for each sub-basin in the model.&#13;
The precipitation and temperature scenarios were made available by Vujadinovic and Vukovic (2013),&#13;
as a result from five global/regional climate model (GCM/RCM) simulations under the A1B&#13;
SRES/IPCC scenario8. Table 4 lists the five GCM/RCM combinations and denotes them as climate&#13;
models 1 through 5 (CM1 through CM5) for easier communication. For each climate model, daily pre-&#13;
cipitation and temperature series were produced for three 30-year periods:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢      1961-1990 (past or baseline climate scenario),&#13;
â&#128;¢      2011-2040 (near future climate scenario), and&#13;
â&#128;¢      2041-2070 (distant future climate scenario).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The future scenarios for PET were not available from the GCMs, and therefore they had to be defined&#13;
in another way in order to enable hydrologic simulations. To achieve this with very limited data availa-&#13;
bility, an approach was adopted to assume that the change in future PET can be assessed from the&#13;
change in temperature. This approach is described in section 5.2.2.&#13;

5.2.1 Future climate as predicted by climate models&#13;
The change in temperature and precipitation resulting from five climate models listed in Table 4 for&#13;
two future time frames, 2011-2040 (near future) and 2041-2070 (far future), compared to the baseline&#13;
scenario 1961-1990 are briefly described here, while the detailed results are given by Vujadinovic and&#13;
Vukovic (2013). Figure 19 and Figure 20 present changes in mean annual and seasonal temperature&#13;
and precipitation for two future time frames; the separate graphs in these figures present results for&#13;
five climate models and ensemble median values.&#13;

Temperature&#13;
â&#128;¢    Temperature shows a clear increasing trend, with little variation over the basin.&#13;
â&#128;¢    The average change in mean annual temperature over all meteorological stations used in the&#13;
     hydrologic model ranges from 0.9 to 1.8Â°C (median value 1.0Â°C) for different climate models in&#13;
     the near future and from 2.0 to 3.1Â°C (median value 2.3Â°C) in the distant future.&#13;
â&#128;¢    Different climate models predict the most pronounced increase in temperature in different&#13;
     seasons. For the near future, one model predicts the highest increase in summer, two in autumn&#13;
     and two in winter. For the distant future, one model predicts the highest increase in summer, one&#13;
     in both summer and autumn, and three in winter.&#13;

Precipitation&#13;
â&#128;¢    Precipitation shows variable trends, with a lot of variation across the basin and across the climate&#13;
     models and seasons.&#13;
â&#128;¢    The change in mean annual precipitation is generally very small. This is typically a result of&#13;
     having two seasons with significant, but opposing trends. While the average change in mean&#13;
     annual precipitation at all precipitation stations used in the hydrologic model ranges from â&#128;&#147;6% to&#13;
     +4%, the average change in mean seasonal precipitation ranges from -12% to +14% in the near&#13;
     future and from â&#128;&#147;32% to +19% in the distant future. The variation across the basin is even&#13;
     greater: the change in mean seasonal precipitation at different stations can be as much as Â±30%&#13;
     in the near future and Â±40% in the distant future.&#13;
â&#128;¢    A clear increasing or decreasing trend in seasonal precipitation across the whole basin cannot be&#13;
     seen in all models. For the near future, two models predict a clear increasing trend in winter&#13;
     precipitation and a clear decreasing trend in summer precipitation. For the distant future, three&#13;
     models predict a clear increasing trend in winter precipitation and four models predict a clear&#13;
     decreasing trend in summer precipitation.&#13;
&#13;
To conclude, the climate models indicate that there is a general tendency that temperature would in-&#13;
crease in the future throughout a year, but especially during winter. Precipitation is expected to in-&#13;
crease in winter and decrease in summer.&#13;
&#13;
5.2.2 Scenarios for PET&#13;
Since future scenarios for potential evapotranspiration were not available from the GCMs, it was nec-&#13;
essary to define them in another way in order to enable credible hydrologic simulations. The choice of&#13;
potential methods was very limited since no information was available on any of the climatological pa-&#13;
rameters affecting PET (e.g. solar radiation, humidity, wind speed) except the air temperatures, nei-&#13;
ther for the past climate nor for future projections. It was therefore decided to assume that PET&#13;
changes with a change in temperature.&#13;
&#13;
It should be noted that the monthly PET used in the calibration and verification of the hydrologic mod-&#13;
el was taken either from the data gathered from the trend report or from data obtained from riparian&#13;
experts employed directly by World Bank. PET from the trends report was generally calculated by the&#13;
riparian consultants using the modified Eagleman method (Eagleman, 1967; Pandzic et al, 2009),&#13;
while there is no information on the methods of PET calculation for data obtained from the riparian&#13;
experts. Furthermore, seasonal distribution of monthly PET in HEC-HMS was defined for each sub-&#13;
basin based on available PET from the nearest meteorological station, but these seasonal distribu-&#13;
tions were further modified if necessary to enhance the model performance in the calibration process.&#13;
&#13;
Having in mind such a variety of sources and methods for the past climate PET data used in the hy-&#13;
drologic model, a reasonable approach would be to define future PET relative to PET for the past cli-&#13;
mate and not in absolute terms. If the future PET would be calculated using some temperature-based&#13;
formula with future temperature data, the past and future PET would most probably be inconsistent.&#13;
Therefore, it was concluded that the temperature-based estimation of PET should be made for both&#13;
past and future temperatures from climate models in order to determine the change in PET, and then&#13;
to apply this change to the past climate PET data used in the hydrologic model.&#13;
&#13;
To define change in future PET using the change in temperature, the methods for calculating PET&#13;
based on the temperatures alone have been considered and the Hargreaves equation (Hargreaves&#13;
and Samani, 1985) was chosen for further use. This equation is considered to yield results quite com-&#13;
parable to the more complex equations that utilize additional meteorological parameters, such as the&#13;
Penman-Montieth equation (Xu et al, 2002). The Hargreaves equation for PET (in mm/day) reads:&#13;
&#13;
        PET ï&#128;½ 0.0023 Ra TD 0.5 (TC ï&#128;« 17.8)&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     Page 26&#13;

Â &#13;
where Ra is the incoming solar radiation at top of the atmosphere (in MJ m-2 day-1), TD is difference&#13;
between maximum and minimum daily temperatures, and TC is the average daily temperature in Â°C.&#13;
The incoming solar radiation Ra is calculated based on astronomical parameters (Allen et al, 1998):&#13;
               GSC&#13;
        Ra ï&#128;½       d r (ï&#129;· s sin ï&#129;ª sin ï&#129;¤ ï&#128;« sin ï&#129;· s cos ï&#129;ª cos ï&#129;¤)&#13;
                ï&#129;°&#13;
&#13;
where GSC is the solar constant (118.08 MJ m-2 day-1), Ï&#134; is latitude (in radians), dr is inverse relative&#13;
distance between Earth and Sun, Ï&#137;s is the sunset hour angle (in radians), and Î´ is solar declination&#13;
(in radians). The last three parameters are computed from the following expressions:&#13;
                          ï&#131;¦ 2ï&#129;° ï&#131;¶                                                 ï&#131;¦ 2ï&#129;°            ï&#131;¶&#13;
        d r ï&#128;½ 1 ï&#128;« 0.33 cosï&#131;§    J ï&#131;·, ï&#129;· s ï&#128;½ arccos( ï&#128;­ tan ï&#129;ª tan ï&#129;¤), ï&#129;¤ ï&#128;½ 0.4093 sin ï&#131;§     J ï&#128;­ 1.405 ï&#131;·&#13;
                          ï&#131;¨ 365 ï&#131;¸                                                ï&#131;¨ 365           ï&#131;¸&#13;
&#13;
where J is the Julian day number.&#13;
&#13;
While the mean daily temperature is readily available for both past and future climate at all relevant&#13;
locations in the SRB, the minimum and maximum daily temperatures are available only for stations&#13;
considered from the trends report and are not provided in the future climate scenarios. After analysing&#13;
available observed minimum and maximum temperature data at several meteorological stations, a&#13;
difference of TD = 11Â°C was adopted for further calculations.&#13;
&#13;
The procedure for defining future PET can formally be described in the following way:&#13;
&#13;
1. Retrieve PET used in the model calibration for the reference period, PET(1961-1990).&#13;
2. Calculate PET for the reference period using temperature data from a climate model, PET*(1961-&#13;
   1990).&#13;
3. Calculate PET using temperature data from the climate model for two future periods, PET*(2011-&#13;
   2040) and PET*(2041-2070).&#13;
4. Find the change in calculated PET:&#13;
         â&#136;&#134;(2011-2040) = PET*(2011-2040) / PET*(1961-1990), and&#13;
         â&#136;&#134;(2041-2070) = PET*(2041-2070) / PET*(1961-1990).&#13;
5. Determine future PET from the past PET and the corresponding change:&#13;
         PET(2011-2040) = PET(1961-1990) * â&#136;&#134;(2011-2040), and&#13;
         PET(2041-2070) = PET(1961-1990) * â&#136;&#134;(2041-2070).&#13;
The above procedure has been applied to each sub-basin in the hydrologic model and for all five cli-&#13;
mate models.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.3       Hydrologic simulation with baseline climate scenarios&#13;
The results of the model simulations with input from five climate models of past climate 1961-1990&#13;
(denoted as CM simulations) were compared to the observed data and the simulations with the ex-&#13;
tended precipitation and temperature record for 1961-1990 (denoted as ER simulations). It was found&#13;
that the simulated streamflows are comparable to the observed ones in this period, but only in statisti-&#13;
cal terms. Neither daily nor monthly hydrographs from CM simulations are comparable to the ob-&#13;
served streamflow hydrographs and the hydrographs from ER simulations. An example of these hy-&#13;
drographs is shown in Figure 21.&#13;
&#13;
A closer look into the precipitation and temperature data series from the climate models for 1961-&#13;
1990 reveals that these time series do not resemble the observed record, neither on a daily nor on a&#13;
monthly scale (examples are shown in Figure 22). This is probably a result of attributing the climate&#13;

On the other hand, mean monthly precipitation and temperatures over 1961-1990 from the climate&#13;
models are in good agreement with the corresponding observed values, and therefore a reasonable&#13;
agreement is achieved between simulated and observed mean monthly flows. Examples of seasonal&#13;
distribution of precipitation are shown in Figure 23, while Figure 24 shows two examples of stream-&#13;
flow seasonal distributions. These two examples are typical representatives of good (Drina @ Bajina&#13;
BaÅ¡ta) and not so good (Sava @ Å½upanja) results. The CM simulations in Figure 24 are also com-&#13;
pared to the ER simulations beside the observed seasonal streamflow distribution. Although the de-&#13;
partures of the CM simulation results from the observed streamflow seasonal distribution can be&#13;
large, both examples indicate that the CM simulation results are grouped around the results of ER&#13;
simulations. A similar tendency can be observed in the results at other hydrologic stations (Appendix&#13;
H). This is expected since the bias correction of the output from climate models was performed using&#13;
the extended precipitation and temperature record.&#13;
&#13;
On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that the uncertainty inherent in the extended record&#13;
propagates through the hydrologic model and that, in combination with the GCM/RCM uncertainties,&#13;
produces variable results in the seasonal distribution of streamflows. Due to the overall uncertainty&#13;
that comprises all possible sources â&#128;&#147; observed data uncertainty, uncertainty of the record extension&#13;

5.4                                   Hydrologic simulations with future climate scenarios&#13;
A total of 15 simulation runs were made with the hydrologic model of the Sava River basin using the&#13;
input (precipitation, temperature and PET) from 5 different climate scenarios and for 3 periods: refer-&#13;
ence or baseline period 1961-1990, and two future periods, 2011-2040 and 2041-2070.&#13;
&#13;
For each future time frame, the change in the mean seasonal and mean annual streamflow at all rele-&#13;
vant locations in the Sava basin was assessed as the percentage change of future streamflow relative&#13;
to that in the baseline period:&#13;

where QFUT is the future streamflow predicted by the hydrologic model from future climate scenarios,&#13;
and QBASE is the streamflow simulated from the input from climate models for the baseline scenario&#13;
1961-1990.&#13;
&#13;
The output from the hydrologic model for all runs has been processed into mean annual flows (ANN)&#13;
and mean flows for four seasons:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢       winter: December, January and February (DJF);&#13;
â&#128;¢       spring: March, April and May (MAM);&#13;
â&#128;¢       summer: June, July and August (JJA);&#13;
â&#128;¢       autumn: September, October and November (SON).&#13;
&#13;
Complete results are listed in Appendix I for 50 locations across the Sava basin for five climate sce-&#13;
narios (Tables I1 through I5). Table I6 gives the ensemble median values. The spatial distribution of&#13;
the ensemble median runoff changes is shown in Appendix J for all seasons and on the annual level.&#13;
In this appendix, green numbers indicate an increase and red numbers indicate a decrease in stream-&#13;
flow at a given location.&#13;
&#13;
Table 5 presents a synthesis of all results showing the ensemble median change in mean seasonal&#13;
and annual flows averaged over 50 locations across the Sava basin. Results from all climate models&#13;
and the ensemble median values are given in Figure 25, where the box-and-whiskers plots describe&#13;
the range of changes at 50 locations across the basin.&#13;
&#13;
Changes for selected locations in the SRB derived from the simulated runoff for four seasons and on&#13;
an annual level are presented in Figure 26 to Figure 30 inclusive with separate results for the five cli-&#13;
mate scenarios. The selected locations include several hydrologic stations along the Sava River and&#13;
the mouths of the major tributaries.&#13;

Figure 30: Change in mean annual (ANN) runoff at selected locations for five climate scenarios.&#13;
A general conclusion that can be made from the results is that change in the hydrologic regime corre-&#13;
sponds to the projected change in precipitation and temperature. The most notable change in both the&#13;
near and distant future is the increase of stream flow in the winter season for 11% and 13% respec-&#13;
tively on average, as the result of the increased precipitation and a significant increase in tempera-&#13;
tures. The higher temperatures and increased precipitation in the winter season suggest that there&#13;
would be either smaller share of snow compared to rainfall or more snowmelt, but both alternatives&#13;
lead to greater winter stream flow. This increase is evident in the results from all five climate scenari-&#13;
os in both time frames (Figure 26) and over the whole basin (Figure 25 and maps in Appendix J).&#13;
&#13;
A substantial decrease of stream flow is expected in the spring and summer seasons, but somewhat&#13;
differently in the near and distant future. The spring decrease is clear in both near and distant future&#13;
over the whole basin, being greater in the distant future with greater variation over the basin. Summer&#13;
runoff decreases in the near future according to four scenarios, and increases according to scenario&#13;
CM5 (Figure 28). Because of the positive changes for CM5, the ensemble median decrease is mod-&#13;
erate (on average around 5.1%), with 8 locations exhibiting an increase. In the distant future, summer&#13;
runoff decreases substantially by about 15% on average and clearly over the basin. This behaviour is&#13;
mostly following the pattern of decreased precipitation and higher temperatures projected by the cli-&#13;
mate models, except that the near future summer runoff reduction is less pronounced despite greater&#13;
reduction of precipitation.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                     Page 33&#13;

&#13;
The autumn season exhibits a very small change in average for both the near and distant future. The&#13;
five scenarios produce changes in basin response with opposite signs, so that the change in ensem-&#13;
ble median runoff is almost negligible in the near future (on average +0.4%) with almost equal number&#13;
of locations exhibiting increase and decrease. For the distant future the stations are exhibiting a pre-&#13;
vailing decrease over those with an increase, so that the average change in ensemble median runoff&#13;
across the basin is small, but negative (-3.3%).&#13;
&#13;
The overall change in runoff on an annual level is small as a result of opposite winter and&#13;
spring/summer trends. Similarly to the autumn runoff, the five scenarios produce annual runoff&#13;
changes of opposite signs, which results in a small decrease in ensemble median runoff for the near&#13;
future (an average of 1.4%). In the distant future this decrease becomes more pronounced (an aver-&#13;
age of 4.7%) despite a very similar proportion of the number of locations with decreased runoff to that&#13;
in the near future (40 compared to 38).&#13;

Changes in high and low annual flows, defined as the flow with 10% and 90% respective probability of&#13;
exceedance in the 30-year series of mean annual flows, are shown in Figure 31. The results indicate&#13;
that low annual flows are subject to a small reduction, meaning that the proportion of very dry years&#13;
would slightly increase. On the other hand, high annual flows show greater reduction, indicating that&#13;
the proportion of very wet years would decrease. Altogether, these results are in accordance with the&#13;
fairly small overall reduction in runoff on an annual level, as shown in Table 5.&#13;

6                  REMARKS ON UNCERTAINTY OF THE RESULTS&#13;
The hydrologic simulations with climate projections from the global climate models are widely used to&#13;
assess the potential impact of climate change. However, it should be noted that there are a number of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   Page 34&#13;

uncertainties associated with making such projections. Uncertainty is introduced at each stage of this&#13;
process (Gosling et al. 2011):&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢    Uncertainty in definition of greenhouse gas emission scenarios exist because of unpredictability&#13;
     of future economic and societal development.&#13;
â&#128;¢    Climate model structural uncertainty causes different GCMs to produce different projections for&#13;
     the same scenario.&#13;
â&#128;¢    Uncertainty is also related to downscaling GCM projections to finer spatial and temporal scales&#13;
     for hydrological modelling.&#13;
â&#128;¢    Hydrological models used to translate climatological changes to hydrological impacts add&#13;
     additional uncertainty.&#13;
&#13;
GCM uncertainty has frequently been found to be the largest source of uncertainty, followed by the&#13;
emissions scenarios and hydrological modelling (Bates et al, 2008; Gosling et al. 2011). Uncertainty&#13;
coming from GCMs is associated with limitations and assumptions in representing the physics of&#13;
some of the key processes and the coarse grid size. In addition to this structural uncertainty, climate&#13;
models are sensitive to the initial conditions. Different model structure and different initial conditions&#13;
are the reason why GCMs developed by different climate modelling institutions result in different cli-&#13;
mate projections for a single greenhouse gas emissions scenario. The climate model structural uncer-&#13;
tainty is usually assessed by using an ensemble of climate projections from GCMs and producing an&#13;
ensemble of impact projections, which is the approach applied in this study. However, it should be&#13;
noted that only precipitation and temperature scenarios were available, while the future tendencies in&#13;
potential evapotranspiration (PET) had to be devised from the temperature scenarios due to the lack&#13;
of data necessary for PET calculations.&#13;
&#13;
The coarse spatial resolution of GCM results is not suitable for a reasonable description of the hydro-&#13;
logic systems. The downscaling methods are therefore used to downscale the climate model output to&#13;
a finer resolution. Two approaches are typically applied, statistical downscaling and dynamical&#13;
downscaling. The former uses statistical relationships to convert the GCM output from large to finer&#13;
scales. A central assumption of statistical downscaling is that the downscaling relationship derived for&#13;
the present day will also be valid in the future. The climate projections used in this study are&#13;
downscaled from GCMs using regional climate modelling as a dynamical downscaling tool (Vujadi-&#13;
novic and Vukovic, 2013). This approach is generally thought to be subject to fewer uncertainties than&#13;
the statistical downscaling approach.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to downscaling, the GCM output is also corrected for bias (Vujadinovic and Vukovic, 2013).&#13;
The bias correction procedure is applied to raw GCM output to obtain the series having statistical&#13;
properties (primarily the mean) of the observed data. This is particularly important for precipitation&#13;
projections, where differences between the observed values and those computed by climate models&#13;
can be considerable. The procedure consists of mapping the observed data frequency distribution to&#13;
that of the raw GCM output using an empirically developed transfer function. The transfer function is&#13;
identified on the data from the baseline period and then applied to GCM output for future periods. A&#13;
source of potential uncertainty is the underlying assumption on stationarity of the transfer function.&#13;
&#13;
When the downscaled and bias-corrected climate data is used as the input to a hydrological model,&#13;
both the model structure and parameters contribute to the overall uncertainty. The model uncertainty&#13;
arises from the simplifications that are necessary to describe the hydrologic cycle at the current level&#13;
of knowledge on the relevant processes and with available data. The modelling methods in HEC-HMS&#13;
used in this study can generally be characterised as simple because they require a minimum of input&#13;
data, but their use was dictated by data availability. The parameter uncertainty arises from the possi-&#13;
bility that the â&#128;&#156;optimalâ&#128;&#157; parameter values obtained through the model calibration process may not be&#13;
close to the real physical parameters of the processes on the catchment. The performance of the hy-&#13;
drologic model of the SRB developed in HEC-HMS has proved to be good at the majority of locations&#13;
across the basin, so that the authors believe that the hydrologic regime of the Sava River and its tribu-&#13;
taries is well represented by the model at the scale of the study. Nevertheless, further improvements&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                          Page 35&#13;

Â &#13;
would be possible with a hydrologic model that would be able to better describe the subsurface water&#13;
storage in the basin, especially in the karst areas which are present in the SRB. However, such a&#13;
model would require more detailed data from the basin that may not be readily available.&#13;
&#13;
Additional uncertainty in this study is associated with the climate data record extension described in&#13;
section 2.4. Filling in the gaps and extending data records was necessary in order to make a reason-&#13;
able coverage of the SRB in the reference period 1961-1990. The extended observed data record&#13;
was the basis for creating future precipitation and temperature daily series by Vujadinovic and&#13;
Vukovic (2013) through the bias correction procedure, thereby adding to the uncertainties emanating&#13;
from climate modelling. However, the authors believe that the impact of this additional uncertainty is&#13;
avoided or at least significantly reduced by taking the bias-corrected GCM output for 1961-1990 as&#13;
the baseline climate input for the hydrologic model instead of the observed climate data, and then&#13;
evaluating the hydrologic change by comparing runoff simulations with GCM output for future time&#13;
frames with that for the reference period 1961-1990. In other words, the baseline runoff in this study&#13;
was not the historically observed runoff, but the runoff simulated with baseline climate scenarios from&#13;
GCMs.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, it should be noted that the runoff simulated with climate data from the GCMs can only be tak-&#13;
en into further analysis of impacts on water management with its mean annual or seasonal values&#13;
over the 30-year periods and not as the daily or monthly time series. In other words, the resulting&#13;
streamflow series should not be treated as long-term forecasts. While it could be said that the mean&#13;
values and the variation of the future runoff on monthly time scale are well represented by the model-&#13;
ling results, this is not the case with extreme runoff. In the domain of floods, simulated runoff does not&#13;
yield representative results mainly as a consequence of unrealistically high daily precipitation pro-&#13;
duced by GCMs. A different approach is needed to assess the flooding potential under climate&#13;
change that would be able to capture changes in extreme precipitation and the basin response under&#13;
such input. Such an approach has been applied by Brilly et al. in a separate report to the World Bank.&#13;

            Water and climate adaptation plan for the
            Sava river basin
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report presents the water and
            climate adaptation plan (WATCAP) developed for the Sava
            river basin (SRB) as result of a study undertaken by the
            World Bank. The WATCAP is intended to help to bridge the gap
            between the climate change predictions for the SRB and the
            decision makers in current and planned water management
            investment projects that will be affected by changing
            climate trends. The purpose of the report is to: (i) assist
            stakeholders and decision makers in assessing and planning
            for the risks generated by climate change impacts on water
            resources; (ii) provide a basis for future plans and studies
            of adaptation to climate change impacts in the SRB; and
            (iii) stimulate cooperation and debate across the basin
            toward additional and more detailed studies on climate
            change impacts at the regional and basin scale. The SRB is
            projected to experience small increases in water use by the
            public water supply, industry, energy, and agricultural and
            irrigation sectors. However, it is widely expected that new
            hydropower plants (HPPs) will be constructed in the near
            future, making energy (primarily through hydropower) the
            most important water use in the SRB.
