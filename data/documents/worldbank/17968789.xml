                         Bennett , William L.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted by Professor Robert W. Oliver, on 1988-01-20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     William Bennett came to the Bank in January '49 as Financial&#13;
Editor, on loan for one year from the New York Herald Tribune where he&#13;
was bank editor. He came at the invitation of John McCloy, to&#13;
publicize the Bank, and deal with the rating services and other groups&#13;
assessing the quality of securities. At the same time, Rupert Fuller&#13;
was hired to handle the press. By the end of the year he was offered a&#13;
permanent position by Robert Garner, then Vice President and General&#13;
Manager of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Bennett covers Eugene Meyer's brief tenure as first President&#13;
[June'46-Dec'46], his disagreement with the US Executive Director&#13;
Emilio Collado and Sir James Grigg the UK Director over the Board&#13;
having executive power to run the day to day operations of the Bank,&#13;
and Meyer's subsequent resignation. The circumstances under which&#13;
McCloy was nominated and the conditions under which he agreed to&#13;
become second President of the Bank, bringing along Black who replaced&#13;
Collado as US Executive Director, Garner as Vice President and General&#13;
Manager, and E. Fleetwood Dunstan as Marketing Director. This group&#13;
ran the Bank from March'47 to approximately July'49 when McCloy left&#13;
to become UN High Commissioner in Germany, Black succeeded him as&#13;
President, Dunstan returned to Banker's Trust, and Garner stayed on&#13;
and finally retired in 1961 as President of the International Finance&#13;
Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Bennett elaborates on the Bank's bond ratings, the efforts made&#13;
by McCloy and his team to raise the Bank's visibility and to establish&#13;
its credibility as a lender. The various loans made, mainly the first&#13;
reconstruction loan to France in May'47, those made to other European&#13;
&amp;#12;countries, the first development loan to Chile in March '48, and the&#13;
expansion in development lending in the '50s. He covers in detail&#13;
Woods' personality, his affiliation with the Bank prior to becoming&#13;
its President, his nomination by President Kennedy in 1962, the Woods&#13;
era and the expansion of agricultural loans. More importantly, Woods'&#13;
relationship with the Board, the IDA problems and his battles with the&#13;
US administration and congress, his handling of the media and the&#13;
staff involved, his feelings about being reelected as President, and&#13;
his rapport with Eugene Black. Bennett assesses Woods' thorough&#13;
knowledge of the Bank and the relevance of bringing him as President,&#13;
his involvement in the choice of McNamara as his successor and&#13;
President Lyndon Johnson's subsequent nomination of him in Dec.'67, as&#13;
well as the reaction of the Board, staff, and media to McNamara's&#13;
appointment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Finally, Bennett talks about Woods recommending him to McNamara&#13;
resulting in his appointment as the Bank's representative in New York&#13;
as financial relations advisor, and opines on the pros and cons of&#13;
IDA's set up within the Bank.&#13;
