PRIVATE DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES:&#13;
POLICY ISSUES FOR HOST AND HOME GOVERNMENTS&#13;
AND FOR INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report, 1979&#13;
The paper discusses the changing characteristics of private direct&#13;
foreign investment in developing countries in relation to home and host&#13;
country policies.&#13;
An overall view of the geographical and sectoral characteristics of&#13;
private direct foreign investtent flows to developing countries introduces&#13;
the paper. The response of the transnational corporations to the changing&#13;
environment in developing countries is then discussed. The main body of the&#13;
paper is concerned with policy issues for the developing countries that wish&#13;
to attract private direct foreign investment and for the industrialized&#13;
countries that are the principal source of such flows. The authors conclude&#13;
that overall macro economic and sectoral policies are of overwhelming policy&#13;
importance, but also explore incentive policies and some institutional issues.&#13;
A discussion of the role of international institutions in the private investment&#13;
environment concludes the paper. A statistical annex reviews the availability&#13;
of data and provides a set of basic data, updating Working Paper No. 149.&#13;

PRIVATE DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES:&#13;
A SUMMARY OF TRENDS AND POLICY ISSUES&#13;
This paper on private direct foreign investment 1/ starts with&#13;
the premise that the outlines of the private investment situation&#13;
are well known. In economic terms, transnational corporations are profit-&#13;
maximizing, private enterprise with capital, management, technological and&#13;
marketing capabilities, whose operations yield private returns. They also&#13;
have social costs and benefits in their home and host countries. These&#13;
depend on the "rules of the game" within which they operate, for these&#13;
rules determine both private and social returns. The "rules of the game"&#13;
have undergone marked changes in recent years and have changed the&#13;
characteristics of private investment. New entrants--Japanese and European&#13;
firms, and some from developing countries--have changed the behavior of&#13;
transnationals.&#13;
The paper summarizes the principal trends and policy issues in&#13;
the area of private direct foreign investment. Private investment&#13;
statistics are incomplete and, except in the limited DAC series, are not&#13;
strictly comparable from country to country. The following is a brief&#13;
summary of the principal trends, which show divergencies among countries&#13;
and within the period covered. Japan and Germany have joined the United&#13;
States, United Kingdom and France as important "home" countries.&#13;
The share, by country, of private investment flows to developing&#13;
countries out of total flows in the last decade has been about 14% for the&#13;
US, 19% for the UK, nearly 30% for Germany and France, and nearly 60% for&#13;
Japan. The shares of France, the UK and the US have been declining, while&#13;
that of Germany has been growing. In Japan it is expected to decline in&#13;
the next decade as Japan's investment in other OECD countries increases.&#13;
Nearly 40% of the private investment flow from 1966 to 1976 went&#13;
to Latin America and the Caribbean, a little over 25% went to Asia, mainly-&#13;
to Southeast Asian countries.&#13;
With respect to sectors, petroleum accounted for a third, manu-&#13;
facturing nearly 40% and services such as banking that were associated with&#13;
manufacturing over 20% of investment flows.&#13;
Rate of Flow&#13;
Real private investment flows to developing countries grew at about&#13;
4% per annum during the 1960s. Disinvestment in petroleum and other minerals&#13;
was a factor. Growth accelerated to 10% per annum in the 1970s, reflecting&#13;
rapid middle income country growth and the raw material boom of the early&#13;
1970s. The literature on private investment is enormous, but the state of&#13;
the art can be summarized as follows. Given some positive impact from&#13;
private investment in terms of the flow of capital, management and technology&#13;

ii &#13;
which would not otherwise have been availabla9 there Seemo to be little doubt&#13;
that because the "rules of the same" have been inappropriate in the pastD the&#13;
coot/benefit balance to date has been questionable0 Private investment may&#13;
have a development impact, but clearly it can not be characterized as aid0&#13;
The impact of private investment has varied by sector:&#13;
(a)  It was ragarded as inappropriate for privates particularly foreign,&#13;
corporations to operate in "natural" monopoly sectors,&#13;
i.eoD public utilities. Hence corporations in such sectors&#13;
were expropriated at the end of World War 110&#13;
(b)  Tranenational corporations in the past were regarded as taking too&#13;
large a share of land and mineral renteO   This situation also led&#13;
to expropriations, as well as to a reduction in equity and&#13;
introduction of resource rent taxeso Further, many developing&#13;
countries have learned to increase benefits from investments&#13;
in fuel and non-fuel mineral sectors. Current low prices are&#13;
holding up investment, but exploration is well ahead of&#13;
potential demand, and many transnationals have investment&#13;
plans ready for implementation. This has meant a transfer of&#13;
economic rents from transnationals and developed country&#13;
consumers to mineral-producing developing countries0 Presently&#13;
new transnationals entering mineral production are doing so&#13;
on terms much more favorable to the developing countries0 The&#13;
old transnationals, whose corporate memory goes back to the&#13;
19th century, are not pleased0&#13;
(c) In manufacturing, developing countries gave transnational&#13;
corporations access to high monopoly rents by excessively&#13;
protective import substitution policies0 In some cases this&#13;
situation was carried further by excess export subsidies0 The&#13;
countries have resented the monopoly profits of the corporations&#13;
and the associated problems of other than an wa length transfer&#13;
pricing0&#13;
(d)  In many countries, protection, other incentives and direct&#13;
controls have been used to stimulate inappropriate industries&#13;
and technologies0 These policies were particularly attractive&#13;
to transnational corporations, often requiring their resources0&#13;
The result has been high social costs for the industrializing&#13;
countries.&#13;
(e)  Unless a country's monetary policies are well managed, there may&#13;
be dangers in excessive private investment in banking, insurance,&#13;
etc0 This potential for problems has led to caution toward&#13;
private investment in these sectors.&#13;
(f) There are very grave economic, political and social dangers&#13;
of heavy private investment in such sectors as mass media0&#13;
These sectors have therefore generally been closed to such&#13;
investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
On balance, much of the private investment that has taken place has&#13;
almost certainly been inappropriate and in that sense excessive. Had industrialization&#13;
been oriented toward mass consumption, much of-the production-differentiated, high&#13;
income consumer good-oriented production that attracts transnational corporations&#13;
would have been avoided. Hong Kong and Korea (Republic of, and Democratic&#13;
Republic of) havs industrialized with relatively little foreign investment&#13;
and have still grown rapidly (although the role of aid from the US government&#13;
and the Soviet Union to the two countries respectively can not be overlooked).&#13;
Experience with incentives such as tax holidays, frequently given&#13;
by host and home countries, suggests that they have little long run 4A-act&#13;
and that they are costly. The same may not, however, be true of adminis-&#13;
trative measures supported by direct subsidies, such as those used in&#13;
Japan. Policy stability is extremely important. Provision for the re-&#13;
negotiation of contracts should be included as a matter of course, not&#13;
come as a surprise.&#13;
With respect to technology transfer, the effect of private invest-&#13;
ment has been dubious. A great deal, though not all, "best practice"&#13;
technology is available (i) independently and (ii) with a partial package&#13;
of license agreements', etc. Most mass-oriented products do not require the&#13;
foreign investment-technology package. Transnational corporations are not&#13;
particularly adept at transferring "appropriate technology."&#13;
In the area of exports, the main advantage of transnationals has&#13;
been in marketing.. Again, such assistance has been available independently&#13;
in some industries, though not in all. Intra-firm international trade does&#13;
have anti-protectionist advantages.&#13;
Political trouble has followed private investment, even in developed&#13;
countries, where it has come predominantly from one home country and where&#13;
countries have been merely foreign investment recipients, e.g., Europe in the&#13;
1950s, Canada and Australia.   It is therefore important for developing&#13;
countries to diversify their sources of private investment and develop their&#13;
own transnationals. This development is taking place.&#13;
The political and cultural aspects of private investment cannot&#13;
be ignored. Transnationals may not operate in ways that are directly counter&#13;
to national policies, but they usually exercise a powerful political influence,&#13;
often in conjunction with prominent local interests. This influence is an&#13;
additional strong reason for diversifying the sources of private investment&#13;
in any country. Increased diversity of transnationals in terms of geographic&#13;
origin and size is making diversification possible.&#13;
In developing countries, current trends are toward:&#13;
(a) "Unbundling" of capital, technology, management, marketing,&#13;
etc., by transnationals.&#13;
(b)  Better host policies, combined with much more experienced,&#13;
tougher bargaining postures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iv &#13;
Within the industrial countries there io growing concern with the&#13;
impact of private investment outfiloo on the doQetic economy (particularly&#13;
on employment and scarce management reaourcce)o This iS analogouo to the&#13;
concern over trade adjustment. Discussion onx theas isse is advanced Ln the&#13;
US, UK and France, but not in Japan, and is lead:ing toxw2ard neutrality in home&#13;
country policies, sometimes with special tr@atmc@t for least developed&#13;
countries. For example, the Swedish government .s helping Tanzania obtain&#13;
favorable conditions in their mutugl dealings0 Mevertheleos, policies in&#13;
most industrial countries are still aimed at maxkiAxng benefits to home&#13;
countries, particularly in mineral investments0&#13;
Not much can be done intemationally beyond establishing general&#13;
rules of "good behavior" for transnati.onals and home and host countries,&#13;
technical assistance for small pooz countries , and bilateral action on&#13;
taxation.&#13;
Statistical difficulties-denlt with at length in Annex I indicate&#13;
that the statiotical conventiona in use do not pe-.Xt an evaluation of&#13;
(a) the consistency of past trends, and (b) ipact on LDCs or DCso Alternative&#13;
conventions would, howevez, be difficult to devise and eveu more difficult&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Private direct foreign investment (PDFI) in developing countries&#13;
dates back to the 19th century. During the colonial and neocolonial&#13;
period, it was concentrated in export-oriented mineral and agricultural&#13;
production and in public utilities. Mines and plantations were enclaves&#13;
with little overall impact on the growth of largely subsistence agri-&#13;
cultural economies: foreign investors, often backed by their home govern-&#13;
ments, appropriated most of the economic rents. As nationalist movements&#13;
emerged, these investors came to be regarded as exploiters.&#13;
Economic and political opposition to foreign investment was not&#13;
confined to the colonial countries. There was growing opposition to&#13;
investment from abroad in Canada and Australia in the 1920s and 1930s.&#13;
The same was true in Europe in the 1950s, when American inflows were&#13;
at their peak and European outflows were still negligible. Japan&#13;
simply kept foreign investors out.&#13;
Attitudes in developing countries toward private foreign&#13;
investment have accordingly ranged from cautious to prohibitive.&#13;
Many countries followed Mexico's pre-World War II lead and nationalized&#13;
the assets of foreign corporations, particularly in mining where&#13;
large rents were at issue. Public utilities were brought into the public&#13;
sector to avoid exploitation of natural monopolies by private firms.&#13;
However, the desire to industrialize made a new form of private&#13;
investment attractive to boLh transnational corporations and developing&#13;
countries. The host countries wanted to acquire technological and man-&#13;
agement skills, while the corporations wanted to defend and buy into&#13;
the vast new markets opened up by industrial growth. Unfortunately,&#13;
the high degree of protection accorded the transnational corporations&#13;
in most developing countries led to new opportunities for monopoly&#13;
profits and thus further fueled opposition to foreign investors, leading&#13;
to schizophrenic attitudes toward private investment in most developing&#13;
countries. The transnational corporations often heightened the opposition&#13;
by insisting on complete control of subsidiaries, ignoring local government&#13;
directives, failing to train and promote local staff and, until the late&#13;
1960s, forbidding exports to home country or third markets by manufacturing&#13;
subsidiaries. The interests of transnational corporations and of the&#13;
host countries did not necessarily coincide, particularly where the "rules&#13;
of the game" were highly distorted by protectionism, subsidies to&#13;
capital and direct controls that favored large, 'apital-intensive plants.&#13;
Given these conditions, foreign firms tended to grow at the cost of local&#13;
ones.&#13;
While transnational corporations themselves benefitted from&#13;
investment abroad, their home countries did not necessarily do so,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
particularly those which were poorer. Thus the subsidies which were&#13;
given to private foreign investment to assure home countries' access&#13;
to raw materials, to maintain exports and, in some cases, to provide&#13;
assistance to ieveloping countries were by no means universally supported.&#13;
Labor saw a potential danger in the undue, incentive-promoted, investment&#13;
abroad; it feared such investment would lead to relatively low capital/labor&#13;
ratios in the home country in the future. Labor would bear the costs&#13;
of adjustment to investment abroad, without benefltting commensurately--&#13;
the uneveness of domestic income distribution would be exacerbated by&#13;
the tax benefits given to transnational corporations and their senior&#13;
staff working abroad.&#13;
In addition, there are issues other than cconomic ones which&#13;
must be noted. Private investment cannot be analyzed in purely economic&#13;
terms; it is a political phenomenon as wello Developing countries fear&#13;
private foreign investment because it has neoimperialist connotations.&#13;
Some home countries of course welcome it for the same reasons. Trans-&#13;
national corporations wield political power within both home and host&#13;
countries, in the latter usually in collaboration with local citizens&#13;
on whom they are seen to have a corrupting influence. In such areas as&#13;
the media, foreign investment is seen as having a cultural as well as&#13;
a political influence, and foreign corporations are usually barred&#13;
from this sector, even in countries with otherwise liberal attitudes&#13;
to foreign investment0&#13;
The extensive disinvestment of the 1950s and 1960s was not sur-&#13;
prising; flows of new foreign investment to developing countries were&#13;
slow during that period0 The rate of growth, however, did accelerate&#13;
toward the end of the 1960s--from about 4% per year to about 10-12%&#13;
a year0 /1 The acceleration resulted from two principal sets of factors0&#13;
First was the overall expansion of the developing countries' economies&#13;
in the late 1960s and 1970s, with particularly high rates of growth&#13;
in those middle income developing countries to which the bulk of the in-&#13;
vestment has flowed. Second were the changing attitudes on the part of&#13;
transnational corporations and the changes in policies of host and home&#13;
governments, which created an environment in which the costs of foreign in-&#13;
vestment flows were reduced and the benefits increased for both host&#13;
and home countries0&#13;
1/ These and other private investment figures are extremely tenuous&#13;
for the following reasons: (a) the concept of equity interest cannot&#13;
be translated into exact figures; (b) private direct foreign investment&#13;
is an internal transaction within a firm; (c) reinvested profits&#13;
are at least 40% of private investment flows, but they are not re-&#13;
corded accurately; (d) the nature of private investment has been&#13;
changing, with less formal equity investment and a move to management&#13;
contracts, etc0 See Annex I for details0&#13;

The policy changes of corporations and countries are, of&#13;
course, part of a continuing long-term process of adjustment. This paper&#13;
focuses on the principal policy issues facing transnational corporations&#13;
and host and home countries in relation to private investment. It&#13;
does not review the extensive literature on such investment /1 or question&#13;
whether private investment per se is "good" or "bad." Rather, it assumes&#13;
that private investment has costs as well as benefits resulting from the&#13;
divergence between private and social benefits and the benefits accruing&#13;
to various groups in a country. The starting point is that it is up to&#13;
the governments of host and home countries to decide whether, and to what&#13;
extent, they want to use or promote private investment as an instrument of&#13;
development. It deals with the problems of private investment and the&#13;
policies for overcoming them where a decision has been made to use&#13;
private investment.&#13;
For host country governments, the real issues are how to&#13;
provide an environment in which transnational corporations can contribute&#13;
to national goals while minimizing the costs and maximizing the benefits&#13;
of private investment. For home country governments, the central&#13;
question is how to prevent adverse effects to the home economy as a result&#13;
of economic activities abroad. Both host and home countries are concerned&#13;
with maximizing the benefits of an efficient international division of&#13;
industrial production.'&#13;
Chapter II briefly indicates the principal trends in private&#13;
investment and then discusses its changing structure. Chapter III&#13;
analyzes the changes in the attitudes of transnational corporations and&#13;
the implications of these changes for governments. Chapters IV and V&#13;
deal with policy issues in developing, host countries and in developed,&#13;
1/ S. Lall, "Less-Developed Countries and Private Foreign Direct Investment:&#13;
A Review Article," World Development, Vol. 2, No. 4-5, 1974, pp.43-48,&#13;
has grouped the approaches to direct foreign investment into six&#13;
categories, three in favor and three against. At the extreme right&#13;
lies the "business-school" approach, with its implicit belief in the&#13;
virtues of the free enterprise system and recommendations as to how&#13;
best to minimize tax-burdens or how to plan the most profitable owner-&#13;
ship strategies. The "traditional economic" approach relies on the&#13;
same basic assumptions: that the freeing of international trade and&#13;
capital flows is conducive both to the welfare of the world and to&#13;
each country.  The "neo-traditionalist" approach shares the same&#13;
fundamental economic values but admits the potential divergence of&#13;
interests between foreign investors and host countries and accordingly&#13;
recommends remedial national and international measures. The "nationalist"&#13;
approach brings the basic virtues of the international free market&#13;
system into question. The "dependence" approach concludes that with&#13;
foreign investment developing countries are likely to remain politically&#13;
dependent and will not achieve real development. The Marxist approach,&#13;
analyzing private investment in terms of economic surplus, rejects&#13;
foreign capital completely.&#13;

home countries. Host country policies are discussed at three levels°-&#13;
general economic policies9, sectoral policies, and policies specifically&#13;
related to private investment--in terms of government-business relations&#13;
(incentive policies , "owTnership" policies and performance-orieit.:ed&#13;
policies) and government-to-government relations. Home country policies&#13;
are discussed in terms of three options--equal treatment of private&#13;
and domestic investment, discrimination against investment abroad and&#13;
promotion of private investment as an instrument of development aid&#13;
policy. Chapter VI is devoted to the role of international institutions&#13;
in the field of private investment. Annex I reviews the very considerable&#13;
statistical problems that face quantitative analysis of private investment&#13;
and provides tables of background data. Annex XI outlines Japanese policies0&#13;
II.  THE CHANGING CHARACTERISTICS OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT&#13;
In the 1950s, after the interruption of World War II, private&#13;
direct foreign investment /1 from the industrialized countries to devel-&#13;
oping countries began to flow again0 By the end of the 1960s, average&#13;
annual flows to developing countries, including reinvested earnings, were&#13;
on the order of $3 billion0 In constant 1975 US dollars, the growth&#13;
rate in the 1960s was about 4% per annum0 This relatively low rate&#13;
of growth reflected the mistrust of developing countries toward private&#13;
investment, reflected in expropriations and prohibitions of entry into&#13;
sensitive sectors in many countries0 Voluntary and mandatory regulation&#13;
of investment outflows by the US government, designed to protect the&#13;
US balance of payments, probably contributed to the low growth0&#13;
In the first half of the 1970s, the rate of investment accelerated,&#13;
reaching $10 billion in 1975, although subsequently flows declined to&#13;
about $7 billion0 /1 The rapid growth of 10% per annum in constant prices&#13;
reflected the middle income developing countries' rapid economic growth&#13;
and their more pragmatic policies toward transnational corporations1, as&#13;
well as the soaring mineral prices of the early 1970s0&#13;
The US has been the dominant source of private investment in&#13;
developing countries, accounting for just over 50% of total flows from&#13;
1960 to 1976. The UK and-France retained a relatively high share, with&#13;
about 10% and 8% respectively0 One of the most striking features is that&#13;
Germany (9%) and Japan(8%)1, both latecomers, have accelerated their&#13;
private investment activities sharply since the beginning of the 1970s1,&#13;
although appreciation of their currencies against the US dollar has un-&#13;
doubtedly been a factor. Private investment flows from these five countries&#13;
accounted for more than 80% of the total in 1960-76 0&#13;

In addition to flows from industrialized to developing countries,&#13;
new flows have been emerging among developing countries as firms have&#13;
become active within Latin America and Southeast and East Asia, although&#13;
the scale has been relatively small. /1&#13;
Despite the acceleration of private investment flows to developing&#13;
countries, these flows have remained a small proportion of total foreign&#13;
investment for most industrialized countries--foreign investment among&#13;
industrial countries still accounts for the bulk of total investment.&#13;
In the US, foreign investment to developing countries was only 14% in&#13;
1966-76; in the UK, 19% in 1965-75; in Germany and France, roughly 30% in&#13;
in 1966-76. Japan was the exception, with some 60% going to developing&#13;
countries in 1966-76, /2 but this share is expected to decline.&#13;

Private investment has moved out of agricultural production&#13;
almost entirely. There has been long-run growth in non-fuel minerals,&#13;
although investment has fluctuated sharply with changing market conditions&#13;
and changing attitudes in developing countries0 After the decline in&#13;
fuel investment accompanying the nationalization of foreign petroleum&#13;
corporations in the Middle East, investment grew rapidly in the 1970s in&#13;
anticipation of and with rising petroleum prices. Nsnufacturing and&#13;
associated services,D notably banking, have seen a steady expansion from&#13;
the 1950s, accounting for more than half the total foreign investment;&#13;
manufacturing alone has accounted for about a third of total investment. /1&#13;

Almost half the private investment flows have gone to Latin&#13;
America and the Caribbean, with Brazil and Mexico the largest recipients.&#13;
Southeast and East Asia were next in importance, although the flow&#13;
was significant only in Indonesia. Investment in Africa has been&#13;
predominantly in petroleum, although manufacturing investment has been&#13;
growing. India and Pakistan and the other countries of Louth Asia have&#13;
had very restrictive policies toward foreign investment, with accordingly&#13;
small inflows. /1&#13;

Redefining Private Investment&#13;
The various data do not, however, tell the whole story.&#13;
There have also been qualitative changes in the nature of private in-&#13;
vestment. In recent years, the changes have been quite rapid, principally&#13;
in two directions. There has been a shift from equity participation to the&#13;
use of loans and suppliers' credits. Second, there has been a shift from&#13;
direct control by the parent company over the management of an associated&#13;
enterprise to management participation, technical assistance agreements,&#13;
production-sharing, supply contracts, etc. The term "private direct&#13;
foreign investment" as it is currently understood--equity participation&#13;
by a foreign firm, with an effective voice in the management of the&#13;
enterprise--does not cover these shifts. Traditional definitions based&#13;
on equity participation now tend to underestimate actual foreign investment&#13;
activity in developing countries. If the trends continue, foreign investment&#13;

III.  THE RESPONSE OF TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS TO THE CHANGING&#13;
ENVIRONMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
In addition to the objectives customarily included in the&#13;
formal economic theory of a firm (profit maximization, cost minimization,&#13;
risk distribution or diversification) which a firm can choose to&#13;
achieve through production abroad, /1 transnational corporations are&#13;
also attempting: /2&#13;
- To safeguard supplies of raw materials--through mining&#13;
and agricultural, including processing, activities;&#13;
- To maintain or enlarge their market share in countries&#13;
with a policy of import substitution through manufacturing&#13;
activities;&#13;
- To take advantage of relatively low labor costs and other&#13;
favorable conditions of production, mainly through export-&#13;
oriented manufacturing and tourism;&#13;
-  To undertake, where profitable, activities which support&#13;
their, and the efforts of others, home country, firms in&#13;
developing countries through banking, insurance and&#13;
other service activities. /3&#13;

3/ Many researchers emphasize that decisions to invest abroad are&#13;
almost always defensive in character e.g. Raymond Vernon, "The&#13;
Economic Consequences of U.S. Foreig'n Direct Investment," in Robert&#13;
E. Baldwin and J. David Richardson,(eds.),International Trade and&#13;
Finance (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1974), pp. 287-290.&#13;
Others address the issue of monopolistic advantages which produce&#13;
private investment abroad, e.g. Charles P. Kindleberger, American&#13;
Business Abroad (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1969), pp. 14-27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

From the foreign investor's point of view, the traditional&#13;
forms of foreign investment satisfied the need for control believed&#13;
to be necessary for achieving these objectives. Control was needed&#13;
to avoid such problems as faulty products or wrong marketing decisions&#13;
that could damage the firm's reputation, or delays in the delivery of raw&#13;
materials or components that could interrupt the flows of inputs and&#13;
outputs in the firmis international network. Traditionally, control was&#13;
attained through majority ownership.&#13;
The changing environment for private foreign investment in&#13;
developing countries has produced new attitudes on the part of trans-&#13;
national corporations toward the forms of arrangements /1 under which&#13;
they can and are willing to conduct their activitie30 These changes&#13;
have not only resulted from such host goveriment policies as the&#13;
nationalization of natural resources, the phasing down of foreign&#13;
equity participation, and limitations on various aspects of foreign&#13;
business activities, they have also resulted from measures such as price&#13;
controls leading to a reduction of profitsD the subsiditation of local&#13;
competition, requirements to sell shares to locals, etc., all of thich&#13;
measures have been used by host governments to squeeze out foreign&#13;
investors.&#13;
Probably the greatest incentive to the development of new&#13;
attitudes has come from increased competitiono New competitors,&#13;
mainly European and Japanese or smaller and lesser known US firms,&#13;
are eager to capture markets and increasingly ready to negotiste&#13;
arrangements which satisfy new host government policies9, while still&#13;
allowing sufficient control to ensure a satisfactory output of products&#13;
or services and to provide adequate returns on investment. The growing&#13;
size of some projects, particularly in the mining sector, has also lead&#13;
to new forms of arrangements: a smaller proportion of equity to total&#13;
investment, co-financing, heavy loan financing, and more partners per&#13;
project to share the financial burden and risk0 /2&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Control and ownership are the core issues. Because many host&#13;
governments want to acquire foreign technology without allowing sub-&#13;
stantial foreign equity participation, transnational corporations have&#13;
sought arrangeresnts which allow the achievement of their objectives&#13;
without substantial ownership, or even without any ownership at all. /1&#13;
Their main objective in the new arrangements is to attain control or&#13;
at least management participation separately from ownerslhip or equity&#13;
participation.&#13;
The tie between control and ownership can be broken down into&#13;
three categories of techniques: /2&#13;
- Arrangements with no ownership at all: co-production&#13;
agreements (to date used mainly in socialist countries),&#13;
production-sharing agreements, and "contracts of work"&#13;
under which the foreign firm acts as a contractor for&#13;
the government.&#13;
- Management contracts, combined with some equity participation.&#13;
- Arrangements giving foreign investor(s) with minor equity participatior&#13;
"special rights", for example, to name certain company officers or to&#13;
have veto power by tying certain decisions to-more than a majority vote:&#13;
or by separating the number of shares from the number of votes&#13;
to give more voting power to foreign investors.&#13;
Transnational corporations have thus learned to safeguard&#13;
supplies and expand markets without using the traditional form of&#13;
private investment. They have also found, through experience, that&#13;
ownership or equity participation are not the only means of meeting their&#13;
profit goals.  Fees and royalties for the various services they provide&#13;
are playing a growing role in the transfer of income from developing&#13;
countries to home countries. (These have the added advantage of being&#13;
a charge prior to dividends and of being a cost rather than an earning&#13;
l/ Western firms have had experience with these arrangements in the&#13;
socialist countries of Eastern Europe, where they have had to&#13;
accept as payment for their technology and capital the products of&#13;
the enterprises concerned without any participation in ownership,&#13;
see Jeffrey M. Hertzfeld, "New Directions in East-West Trade,"&#13;
Harvard Business Review, Vol. 55, No. 3, May-June 1977, pp. 93-99&#13;
The same situation applies to many new petroleum agreements, which&#13;
involve production-sharing agreements or service contracts.&#13;

to reduce ownership over a long-term period&amp;-ay be a more reliable and&#13;
stable basis for business than unlimited majority otamership, if the&#13;
latter is viewed with hostility by the host government. Transnational&#13;
corporations are realizing that activities in developing countries&#13;
can be carried out successfully under a wide ran-e of investment&#13;
arrangements /1 and that they have to adapt their policies if they do&#13;
not want to lose opportunities to more flexible competitors.&#13;
It has also long been evident that transnational corporations&#13;
will conduct business, whether in the form of equity or managnment&#13;
participation, without incentives from host or homo governments.&#13;
Provided that the political and economic environment is favorable to&#13;
private business, the decision to participate directly in an    A e:iSe&#13;
in a developing country is usually almost independent of host and home&#13;
countries' private investment policies. /2 The motivation to enter or&#13;
remain in developing countries is an integral part of a transnational&#13;
corporation's strategy. It is the form of participation and its&#13;
location that can be more readily influenced by host and home country&#13;
policies. With respect to location, foreign investors have a strong&#13;
preference for large markets; thus the concentration of foreign Snvestment&#13;
in a relatively small number of developing countries with potentially&#13;
large markets is likely to continue.&#13;
Transnational corporations increasingly appear to be behaving&#13;
like international firms. Their investment decisions seem to be less&#13;
and less influenced by the traditional considerations of a "homecountry-&#13;
based" firm also operating in host countries. In accommodating the&#13;
changing conditions in developing and in developed host countris , it&#13;

makes little sense for them to think in terms of "home country versus&#13;
host countries." In doing so they are developing a greater distance&#13;
from their home country. This process of internationalization could&#13;
produce more serious problems for the transnational corporations with&#13;
home than with host governments. /1&#13;
IV.  POLICY ISSUES FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
Inflows of private investment have a wide range of potential&#13;
impacts on host country development objectives. They can:&#13;
-  Affect the generation of income, foreign exchange, tax&#13;
revenues and other areas at the macroeconomic level.&#13;
- Affect employment and manpower skills in both the modern&#13;
sectors (generally positively) and the traditional sectors&#13;
(to some extent often negatively).&#13;
- Affect regional and personal income distribution;&#13;
- Change sociocultural institutions and values;&#13;
-  Pave dynamic effects on competition, industrial efficiency,&#13;
technological development and product innovation;&#13;
- Have an impact on the "control potential" of the host&#13;
country's central government, other public authorities,&#13;
domestic organizations and firms. /2&#13;
The major concerns of host countries about private direct foreign&#13;
investment are that: (a) the products produced cater mainly to higher&#13;
income groups; (b) the technology employed is not suitable to the factor&#13;
endowment of their countries; (c) profits are excessive, because even&#13;
though production is inefficient, it is protected by restrictions on imports;&#13;

(d) foreign firms engage in restrictive business practices and conceal&#13;
profits with non-arms' length transfer prices; and (e) large foreign&#13;
firms have privileged access to local capital at the expense of local&#13;
firms.&#13;
For the most part1, host countries' policies have been directed&#13;
toward attracting private investment and maximizing the positive and&#13;
minimizing the negative effects on the host country. However, not&#13;
all developing countries are in a position to obtain private investment&#13;
and at the same time use the economic power of the transnational cor-&#13;
porations to achieve their objectives by directing them toward development&#13;
goals and reducing the costs of private investmento Those in the&#13;
strongest position are the semi-industrialized countries with large and&#13;
rapidly growing markets in which transnational corporations wan,t to&#13;
maintain or enlarge their share of local consumption, even if they&#13;
have to accept limiting conditions. These countries also have 'Well-staffed&#13;
administrations which enable them to negotiate effectively with the very&#13;
powerful transnational corporations0 Other semi-industrialized countries&#13;
with highly productive labor forces and organizational talent which&#13;
can be used as a platform for worldwide exports are also in a strong&#13;
position0 They can attract the type of private investment they believe&#13;
they need to achieve their objectives and yet at the same time constrain&#13;
it appropriately0 There has been a dramatic improvement in recent&#13;
years in the ability of resource-rich countries to appropriate larger&#13;
shares of mineral rents for themselves and to negotiate arrangements&#13;
which diminish the costs of private investment0&#13;
On the other hand, there are still many developing countries&#13;
with limited market potential, a lack of human capital and/or with&#13;
small resource endowments, and without a strong and effective admin-&#13;
istration, which are not yet able to negotiate with transnational cor-&#13;
porations from a position of strength0 At times, their already low&#13;
level of attractiveness and bargaining power is further weakened by&#13;
inappropriate general economic policies0 These countries often try to&#13;
attract transnational corporations by offering a wide range of incentives--&#13;
from tax holidays to government credits--which usually cannot offset&#13;
their disadvantages as loci for investment0 Even when they succeed in&#13;
attracting private investment from abroad, they often do not succeed&#13;
in attaining their development objectives because the incentives mitigate&#13;
against the possible benefits0 /1 While the situation is improving&#13;
1/ It is above all this group of countries which is handicapped by the&#13;
problem of unequal bargaining power with big transnational corporations0&#13;
That problem has received a great deal of attention in the literature0&#13;
See, for example, Stephen Hymer, "The Efficiency (Contradictions) of&#13;
Multinational Corporations," American Economic Review, Vol. 60, May&#13;
1970, PPO 441-4480&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
even for these countries, with smaller transnational corporations entering&#13;
the international arena and new forms of arrangements being made, for&#13;
many of them, obtaining and yet constraining private investment to&#13;
assist them in the achievement of their development objectives is still&#13;
and will continue to be difficult.&#13;
In devising policies to obtain private investment and to&#13;
maximize its benefits and minimize its costs, host governments have to&#13;
take into consideration the following:&#13;
- the paramount importance of general and sectoral policies;&#13;
-  the limited efficacy of incentive policies;&#13;
-  the question of goal achievements by "ownership' policies;&#13;
- the costs and benefits of performance-oriented policies; and&#13;
- the importance of clear procedures and a smoothly working&#13;
"entry" system.&#13;
A. The Paramount Importance of General and Sectoral Policies&#13;
There is a close relationship between the costs and benefits&#13;
of private investment and the general economic policies pursued by host&#13;
governments. These policies deal with the highly controversial issues&#13;
of effectiveness of general economic planning and efficient use of&#13;
available domestic and foreign resources which are beyond the puryiew of&#13;
this paper. However, it should be clear that because they establish&#13;
the economic environment for private investment, the general economic&#13;
policies of a country may well be more important in determining the&#13;
positive and negative effects of private investment than are the&#13;
incentives and regulatory policies related specifically to private&#13;
investment or the particular practices and attitudes followed by&#13;
foreign investors. Sensible general economic policies are often a pre-&#13;
requisite for reducing the windfall profits of transnational corporations&#13;
and the losses to host countries which result from policies such as&#13;
excessively high tariffs or overvalued exchange rates. As an example,&#13;
financial policies that are based on artificially low interest rates&#13;
may induce transnational corporations to look to the subsidized local&#13;
credit markets for financing. If capital goods can be imported duty-free&#13;
at an overvalued exchange rate, making machinery and equipment cheaper&#13;
than they would have been under more neutral policies, foreign as well as&#13;
domestic firms will tend to substitute capital for labor.&#13;
From this it can also be seen that general policies play&#13;
an important role in determining the employment effects of private&#13;
investment. /1 Inappropriate policies also bear on the assertion that&#13;
1/ Constantine V. Vaitsos, "Employment Effects of Foreign Direct Investment&#13;
in Developing Countries," in Edgar C. Edwards,(ed.),Employment in&#13;
Developing Nations (New York:. Columbia University Press, 1974), pp. 331-349.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
transnational firms charge their subsidiaries exorbitant prices for&#13;
components as a means of transferring profits to the home country.&#13;
Without protection or other distortions that enable subsidiaries&#13;
to earn exorbitant profits, there would be less incentive for other&#13;
than arm's length transfer prices. It is not possible to transfer&#13;
excess profits, by whatever device, if they have not been earned.&#13;
Developing countries can provide a better framework for&#13;
private investment and avoid many of the negative aspects by following&#13;
policies that allow prices of products and resources to reflect real&#13;
scarcities more closely. Sound general economic policies help to build&#13;
a good image for the host country and its economic development and create&#13;
confidence. Many case studies have shown that these factors are much&#13;
more effective in attracting foreign investors than the most favorable&#13;
tax incentives. 1/&#13;
The role which private investment can play in helping to&#13;
achieve the development objectives of a host country also depends on&#13;
the policies pursued at the sectoral level and on sectoral development&#13;
programs. A sectoral development program, in particular, can determine&#13;
to a large extent which investments can be envisaged and what the concrete&#13;
investment opportunities are. The more comprehensive and detailed&#13;
the program, the easier it will be for the government to decide in&#13;
advance about the need for private investment for individual projects&#13;
at the various stages of their preparation and to decide on the number&#13;
and size of projects and the backward and forward linkages among&#13;
them, giving attention to economies of scale. With sectoral development&#13;
programs, a government is in a much better position to obtain and&#13;
constrain private investment than it would be if it waited and reacted&#13;
to project proposals made by transnational corporations.   The programs&#13;
would allow the government to determine the import requirements as&#13;
well as the export potential connected with the individual private&#13;
investment projects. A well-elaborated sectoral development program&#13;
(primarily for the industrial sector) would provide information to&#13;
transnational corporations in advance of investment opportunities and&#13;
complementary industries; such information could reduce the risks&#13;
of obtaining required imputs and finding outputs for byproducts. In&#13;
an uncertain environment, such advance information would in most&#13;
cases be a greater inducement than financial incentives.&#13;
B. :The Limited Efficacy of Incentive Policies&#13;
Incentive policies have to be considered in a wider context.&#13;
First, it is the structure and stage of development of the host economy&#13;
which determine the investment decision of transnational corporations.&#13;
In particular, a large and rapidly growing market along with labor or&#13;
natural resource endowments provide powerful incentives for investment.&#13;
1/ See Aharoni, op.cit., pp. 221-242.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
Second, investment decisions are influenced by the general and sectoral&#13;
policies pursued by the host government.' Third, a smoothly working&#13;
investment approval mechanism is very often more important than a&#13;
sophisticated incentive scheme. Given these factors, incentive policies&#13;
tend to be redundant; without these factors, such policies are in-&#13;
effectual.&#13;
Incentive measures can be grouped as follows:&#13;
- Tax concessions (generous investment write-off provisions,&#13;
tax concessions on sales9 exports, license fees, etc.);&#13;
- Tariff concessions (exempting or reducing tariffs on imported&#13;
inputs and the provision of protective tariffs);&#13;
- Financial incentives (investment grants, local loans at&#13;
interest rates below the market level, subsidies for&#13;
exports, wages, training of local labors R&amp;D activities,&#13;
energy, etc.);&#13;
- Other incentives (exchange control concessions, efforts&#13;
to curb labor union activities, lowering environmental or&#13;
employment safety standards, etc.),&#13;
Because of competition among developing countries for foreign&#13;
investors, host governments now offer a wide range of incentives. Such&#13;
incentives are frequently designed largely to offset such disincentives&#13;
as poor general economic policies and a lack of structural factors&#13;
favorable to private investment.&#13;
The actual impact of incentive policies on private investment&#13;
flows seems to be somewhere between ineffective and inefficient.&#13;
They are ineffective in the sense that since many countries have similar&#13;
and competing schemes, they have had little impact on the distribution&#13;
of private investment among developing countries. They are inefficient&#13;
because with better general economic policies and a better entry&#13;
system, the same amount of investment could be attracted at a lower&#13;
cost.&#13;
Tax incentives appear to be a particularly inefficient way&#13;
of attracting private investment or attempting to influence its&#13;
characteristics. The benefits to firms are generally smaller than they&#13;
appear at first glance, the costs to the host country may be greater&#13;
than is immediately obvious, and there is a possibility that part of&#13;
the foregone tax revenue may eventually be taxed by the investor&#13;
country--thus implying a transfer of tax revenue from developing to&#13;
developed countries. In addition, the complex of incentives which host&#13;
governments give foreign investors often has the effect of strengthening&#13;
the position of transnational corporations or their affiliates over&#13;
locally owned firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 °&#13;
As a general rule, less emphasis should be placed on incentive&#13;
policies than on the creation of a sound general investment climate.&#13;
This would at the same time mitigate the incentive competition among&#13;
developing countries which leads to losses of revenue in taxes foregone&#13;
and other costs. If incentives are to be used, direct and clear incentives&#13;
such as grant or concessionary credits, which are of a temporary character&#13;
onlyD are preferable to indirect and structural incentives.&#13;
In many developing countries, the scarce financial resources&#13;
lost through tax revenues foregone or given away as subsidias could&#13;
better have been used to facilitate decisions by foreign investors. The&#13;
cost of on-the-spot investigation and the time-consuming efforts&#13;
required to work through an alien administration have often been&#13;
critical barriers to foreign investors, particul&amp;rly for the smaller,&#13;
less experienced firms. Many host governments in countries which do&#13;
not have large markets could help overcome these obstacles by initiating&#13;
and financing the preparation of pre-feasibility and feasibility studies.&#13;
They could further reduce the costs and difficulties of investigation&#13;
for the foreign firm by supporting it with a special service whicL&#13;
would make the necessary arrangements with, and help it work throu&amp;h,&#13;
the local administration. A system of project preparation would also&#13;
create a basis for the bargaining process between the host government&#13;
and the foreign investor.&#13;
Using industrial development banks as catalysts for private&#13;
investment&#13;
Most developing countries now have one or several public&#13;
development finance corporations or industrial development banks,&#13;
but most focus on indigenous entrepreneurs and local enterprises.&#13;
Because private investment can also stimulate domestic enterprises,&#13;
these institutions could, and some of course already do, encourage private&#13;
investment in conjunction with local firms0 They can act as catalysts&#13;
or marriage brokers between foreign investors and the domestic (private&#13;
and public) sectors by providing financial support (equity and loans&#13;
for local participants) and by project preparation0 Where they lack&#13;
the management skills to do so, they could cooperate with foreign&#13;
banks which have a large industrial clientele in developed countries0&#13;
C0 The Question of Goal Achievements by "Gwnership' Policies&#13;
The more successful a developing country is in attracting private&#13;
investment, the more emphasis it can place on policies that regulate&#13;
performance0 The reduction of the share of foreign ownership in the&#13;
firm has played, and still plays, an important role in host country&#13;
policies toward private investment. This applies particularly to Latin&#13;
American integration schemes such as the Central American or Andean&#13;
Common Markets, where foreign enterprises cannot obtain "integration"&#13;
status unless foreign ownership is relatively low0 However, there are&#13;
strong indications that by concentrating on ownership policies, host&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
governments have gained in ownership rather than in control of the firm&#13;
and thus have not been able to affect the achievement of their broader&#13;
objectives. For example, local shareholding and management by private&#13;
enterprisep or host governments are said to lead to internal checks&#13;
on transfer-pricing practices. However, local managers miay not have&#13;
the competence, information or motivation to counter biased transfer&#13;
pricing practices by the foreign firms.&#13;
Obviously, in many countries the reduction of foreign ownership&#13;
is an objective itself that has to be considered in the context of&#13;
such goals as national independence and identity. Nevertheless, and&#13;
given the value that may be attached to this objective, it also has&#13;
to be recognized that ownership objectives may require a trade-off&#13;
with economic efficiency. /1 Thus, concentrating on ownership policies&#13;
alone is not likely to lead to the achievement of the host country's&#13;
objectives (other than the reduction-of-foreign-ownership objective)&#13;
unless such policies are couched within the framework of general economic&#13;
policies and of other complementary policies that directly regulate the&#13;
performance of the foreign enterprise.&#13;
D. The Costs and Benefits of Performance-Oriented Policies&#13;
A second method of regulating the performance of firms with&#13;
foreign equity and management participation comprises a range of&#13;
policies toward private investment. (These have been developed by&#13;
host governments over the last 10-15 years in order to shift benefits&#13;
from transnational corporations and home countries to host countries,&#13;
to minimize the costs of private investment and to force investors&#13;
(without, however, losing them) to contribute as much as possible to&#13;
the achievement of the host country's development objectives.&#13;
Policies regulating the performance of private investment&#13;
These include measures intended to:&#13;
-  encourage the firm to use as many domestic inputs as possible&#13;
(e.g. by reducing the share of imported inputs step by&#13;
step), the purposes beinlg to increase national income and&#13;
employment and to save foreign exchange;&#13;
1/ See A. E. Safarian and Joel Bell, "Issues Raised by National Control&#13;
of the Multinational Corporation," Columbia Journal of World Business,&#13;
Winter 1973, pp. 11-12. The trade-off between independence and inter-&#13;
dependence with regard to foreign investment is a common problem&#13;
in some developed countries, too. See Raymond Vernon, "Storm over&#13;
the Multinationals: Problems and Prospects," Foreign Affairs, Vol. 55,&#13;
No. 2, 1977, pp. 250-251.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
-  control the firm's access to the local financial market&#13;
and to increase the share of exports year by year, thus&#13;
increasing the earnings of foreign exchange;&#13;
-  reduce tax evasion and transfer pricing;&#13;
- maximizeD quantitatively and qualitatively, the direct&#13;
effect on employment by fixing quotas for the various&#13;
levels of the employment pyramid, including the iwnagement level, by&#13;
requiring the training of domestic employees, the provision&#13;
of health services, etc.;&#13;
- use a set of technology-oriented policies in order to&#13;
restrict the inflow of undersirable technologiess, minimize&#13;
the direct financial cost of the technology transferred&#13;
and achieve greater research and d'           activities&#13;
over a certain period of time, along with the firm's&#13;
access to the technology of the parent company;&#13;
- prevent the creation of excessive market poWer or influence&#13;
on institutions of the host country, e.g. by finding the&#13;
right balance betweenD, on the one hand , pro-oting domastic&#13;
enterprise and fostering its growth agaianst the competitive&#13;
power of transnationals and1, on the other hand1, keeping&#13;
a reasonably efficient industrial structure which permits&#13;
competition but allows for the increasing size of individual&#13;
firms in response to technological and organizational&#13;
progress;&#13;
-  limit restrictive business practices, especially restrictions&#13;
on exports, sources from which imports can be purchased,&#13;
and the use and development of technology0&#13;
In practice, some of these policies are contradictory to&#13;
others. Some policies can have negative effects on the achievement&#13;
of other national objectives. For example, the creation of a "manpower&#13;
elite" can have a negative effect on income and regional distribution.&#13;
Furthermoree, the implementation of these policies is full of pitfalls-&#13;
i.e. administrative capacity is often insufficient for effective&#13;
implementation. The results are therefore sometimes counterproductive,&#13;
not only failing to meet the desired objectives1, but pushing foreign&#13;
firms out.&#13;
The need for discussion of "excessive" incentives&#13;
Performance-oriented policies are causing concern in many&#13;
home countries. As long as the effects of these policies are confined&#13;
to the host economies, no objections are made in the home countries.&#13;
However, where these policies--especially excessive requirements for&#13;
exports1, local content, advanced technology and hlgh export subsidies--&#13;
lead to serious repercussions on home economies1, pressure builds up&#13;
on home governments to take countervailing measures, It is argued that&#13;
such policies1, like subsidies1, distort the international division of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
production, reducing global welfare.   At the same tine, these excessive&#13;
performance-oriented policies can be detrimental to other developing&#13;
countries, particularly to their exports, As transnational corporations&#13;
are simultaneously spreading out from their home bases to other developed&#13;
countries, this adds to the concern of some home governhents. It is&#13;
certainly not possible to draw a clear boundary between reasonable&#13;
policies and those which are excessive in shifting benefits from home&#13;
to host countries, with adverse effects on the former and on global ef-&#13;
ficiency. Appropriate bilateral investment discussions leading to agree-&#13;
ments comprising not only investment protection and the avoidance of&#13;
double taxation, but also to a more coordinated aporoach with respect&#13;
to incentive and regulatory policies by both countries, may te necessary&#13;
to overcome such difficulties.&#13;
E. The Importance of Clear Procedures and Smoothly Working Entry and&#13;
Administrative Systems&#13;
General Framework&#13;
Host government procedures--that is, the degree to which&#13;
the overall strategy is embodied within a general framework of laws,&#13;
rules or regulations, and to what extent case-by-case treatment is applied--&#13;
are decisive in attracting private investment and determining its&#13;
quality. It is important to settle most components of the "rules of&#13;
the game" in a non-discriminatory and unambiguous way. Potential foreign&#13;
investors are usually attracted by having, from the very beginning,&#13;
a clear idea of conditions in the host country. /1 A case-by-case approach,&#13;
in contrast, inevitably places a heavy strain on the usually limited&#13;
administrative capacity of the host country, leading to delays which&#13;
seriously impede the process of obtaining private investment. It&#13;
also usually leads to discrimination (often concealed) among foreign&#13;
investors and between foreign and local investors, whereas a general&#13;
framework can safeguard the principle of equal treatment.&#13;
Even with a sound general framework, it is still possible to&#13;
pursue some case-by-case treatment. The higher the complexity of a&#13;
particular private investment, that is, the higher the level of product&#13;
1/ In addition to sound economic policies and direct assistance in the&#13;
pre-investment phase, offering the potential investor clear, unam-&#13;
biguous and reliable information about conditions well in advance and&#13;
avoiding zigzagging policies are decisive preconditions for attracting&#13;
foreign investment. Entry contracts likewise should contain precise&#13;
data about renegotiation so that the investor knows exactly what&#13;
he has to expect and when. There are strong indications that countries&#13;
which have succeeded in attracting foreign investment by following such&#13;
policies and procedures have also been in a better position to constrain&#13;
foreign investors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
differentiation and technology, the greater will be the need for case-by-&#13;
case treatment. /1 However, even the case-by-case approach should&#13;
follow publishes rules to reduce uncertainties on the side of the potential&#13;
investor and the possibility of arbitrariness on the side of the host&#13;
government.&#13;
Case-by-case evaluation&#13;
The social cost benefit evaluation techniques evolved in&#13;
recent years permit careful evaluation of the socioeconomic impact a&#13;
major project is likely to have on the economy. /2 Given the constraints&#13;
of personnel and time which limit administrations and their decisionmaking&#13;
process, and because highly sophisticated evaluation techniques require&#13;
much time and highly qualified personnel, in practice the application&#13;
of quantitative techniques has to be restricted to relatively simple&#13;
project appraisal and justification. However, Guch analysis should&#13;
provide the information necessary to enable the project to be adjusted&#13;
to the objectives of the host government. The extent to which the government&#13;
will succeed in adjusting the project will depend on its bargaining&#13;
position. Obviously, the more foreign investors are interested, the&#13;
better will be the government's position0 On the other hand, negotiating&#13;
a project with several investors from different home countries also Las&#13;
costs. Even where the government has to deal with only one group, the&#13;
whole investment package may still contain several components from&#13;
different firms0 /3&#13;
It is inadvisable to overemphasize the importance of&#13;
sophisticated evaluation techniques to increase the positive and reduce&#13;
the negative effects of private investment projects0 The application&#13;
of quantitative methods which consume scarce time and manpower and have&#13;
many methodological limitations is of limited value where many qualitative&#13;
factors, the analysis of which is based upon value judgments and subjective&#13;

assumptions, also have to considered. Evaluation can become a bottle-&#13;
neck and slow down incoming investments. If such a system is not to&#13;
be a new barrier to private investment, it must be more policy- and&#13;
negotiation-oriented. A feasible and satisfying solution is to focus&#13;
the analysis and the related policies on one or two objectives, for&#13;
example, on dynamic and competitive import substitution, exports or&#13;
employment, and to make sure these objectives are attained while meeting&#13;
the minimum requirements in other areas. This approach should not be&#13;
seen as reducing the long list of items to be negotiated. /1&#13;
Because of the many deficiencies of any system of evaluation&#13;
and negotiation, governments are well-advised to place more emphasis&#13;
on the development of a project pipeline for foreign investors, using&#13;
local and international consultants., as well as potential foreign&#13;
investors. The project-preparation approach can reduce the complexities&#13;
of the bargaining process and enable the government to respond immediately&#13;
to the constant efforts of transnational corporations to find new&#13;
ways of achieving their own objectives. Projects can be adjusted from&#13;
the inception of negotiations to meet development objectives simultaneously&#13;
with the project preparation that is undertaken in cooperation with&#13;
multilateral and bilateral aid agencies. If pre-feasibility and feasibility&#13;
studies are made in cooperation with potential foreign investors, the&#13;
government will be in a better position to negotiate the key issues&#13;
than it would if it relied on a relatively short analysis of projects&#13;
proposed by foreign investors. This emphasizes the importance of having&#13;
as guides sectoral and subsectoral development programs and of a project&#13;
pipeline as means of directing private investment.&#13;
Main weaknesses of entry and administration systems&#13;
The institutional arrangements needed for evaluation of private&#13;
investment and negotiations with transnational corporations have to be&#13;
accommodated to the administrative structures of the host country /2.&#13;

private investment compiled by P. Streeten, in "The Multinational&#13;
Enterprise and the Theory of Development Policy," World Development,&#13;

of the bargaining process, see Constantine V. Vaitsos, Inter-country&#13;
income Distribution and Transnational Enterprises (Oxford: Clarendon&#13;
Press, 1974), pp. 119-142.&#13;

that host countries should consider establishing centralized negotiating&#13;

Some host countries have established a special agency for reviewing&#13;
and/or negotiating private investment, while others have used the existIng&#13;
structure. Cumbersome special agencies or smoothly working intermiA.nisterial&#13;
committees can be found in some countries, with the reverse in others.&#13;
Overall, the administration of private investment seems to be growing&#13;
increasingly sophisticated and effective. /1   Its main wezkness is&#13;
an inability to insist on transfer pricing at arLI s length prices and&#13;
the failure to achieve performance control, that is, to determfline&#13;
whether the firm has complied with the cornditions of the entry&#13;
contract. Monitoring transnational corporations' activities is as&#13;
important as defining their conditions of entry0 12 A possiLle&#13;
way of approaching this problem is to assign a staff member within&#13;
the entry system to oversee performance and to use as perforaianco controls&#13;
only relatively simple indicators (minimum level of export sales,&#13;
local content or domestic participation).&#13;
The entry system does not always followJ the rules set by&#13;
legislation and official policies. There are many reasons for&#13;
deviations, and in some host countries a conside.rcble gap can be found&#13;
between officially announced policies and their implementation0&#13;
Sometimes the entry system has to play a delicate roleO facilitating&#13;
the entry of private investment by working around private invest4.ment-&#13;
related policies set up to please public opinion, Often the apparatus&#13;
which deals with private investment is itself a barrier. Given the&#13;
many administrative steps and ministries and other Sovernmental&#13;
units that are involved in the process of evaluating and negotiating&#13;
a foreign project, as well as domestic pressure groups, particularly&#13;
local industrialists who feel threatened by competition from 4ransnational&#13;
corporations, delays are not surprising0   Sometimes multilateral or&#13;
bilateral technical assistance can be used to overcome such bottlenecks.&#13;
F. Issues for Consideration among Host Governments and between Home&#13;
and Host Governments&#13;
Developing countries represent a spectrum of levels and types&#13;
of development. Differences in resource endotment, in the comaitment&#13;
of leaders to development, the presence or absence of clear and consistent&#13;
development strategies and development policies and, in some cases,&#13;
attitudes toward population growth lead to differences in the rate of&#13;
development0 The spectrum is widening0 In the OPEiC states,D relatively&#13;

rapid advances are being made in industrialization and the expansion&#13;
of economic and social infrastructure now that financial constraints&#13;
have either completely or largely disappeared and other constraints are&#13;
being progressively removed.   The economic momentum of a nuJiier of semi-&#13;
industrialized developing countries provides grounds for rapid progress.&#13;
Other countries, having in recent years reformulated their policies&#13;
with more consistency, are likely to join the group of semi-industrialized&#13;
nations. On the other hand, it is difficult to see how the countries&#13;
which are, for various reasons (lack of development commitment, in-&#13;
consistent policies, shortage of resources, population explosion),&#13;
almost stagnating can free themselves from the vicious circle of poverty.&#13;
The increasing differentiation among developing countries&#13;
also applies to the field of private investment. Countries which&#13;
have succeeded in attracting and harnessing private investment are&#13;
among those which are already on the way to rapid industrialization.&#13;
They are absorbing the bulk of private investment. The countries&#13;
which are developing slowly and which wish to share in investment flows&#13;
could find it more difficult to do so in the future, particularly if&#13;
the developed countries were to limit investment outflows. The rapidly&#13;
progressing developing countries are building up export markets in&#13;
developed countries. They have also begun tp penetrate the markets&#13;
of other developing countries with a widening range of exports. There&#13;
are already preliminary indications that--in the sense of the product&#13;
cycle--this export penetration will be followed by private investment&#13;
if the entrepreneurs in the advanced developing countries increase&#13;
their capacity for assembling capital and technology. /1&#13;
The same issues of conflict and negotiation are likely to&#13;
emerge between governments of various developing countries as now exist&#13;
between governments of developed and developing countries. However,&#13;
they are likely to be aggravated by some additional questions: how&#13;
to arrive at "arrangements" checking excessive incentive and performance-&#13;
oriented policies toward private investment (or even policies subsidizing&#13;
inward private investment while restricting outward private investment) /2&#13;
in the semi-industrialized, middle income countries; and how to achieve&#13;
something like export market "sharing" arrangements between the advanced&#13;
and other developing countries with respect to the markets of developed&#13;
countries.&#13;

While developed countries have succeeded in using OECD as&#13;
an institution for private investment policy harwDnization, developing&#13;
countries still need a common forum. Even if it is difficult to find&#13;
solutions for the problems caused by the growing gap among developing&#13;
country groups9 procedures for discussing problems such as how to avoid&#13;
incentive races or how to deal collectively with transnational corporations&#13;
are necessary. It is increasingly becoming an open question whether&#13;
such issues are best handled in a regional contento&#13;
Two main issues dominate bilateral negotiations between&#13;
home and host governments. The first concerns the avoidance of serious&#13;
conflicts arising from a continuing shift of benefits from home to host&#13;
countries. The second concerns the harmonization of policies of the&#13;
host country, especially incelative policies, with the respective policies&#13;
of the home country0 The objective of harmonizing policies has been pursued&#13;
for many years0 However, in most cases the initiative has come from&#13;
home countries which have been trying to safeguard their investments&#13;
abroad by guarantee schemes against political risks0 To complement these&#13;
guarantee schemes, an increasing number of bilateral investment&#13;
protection agreements have been concluded between host and home countries0&#13;
Compared with these, only relatively few tax treaties have been concluded&#13;
between developed home and developing host countries9 although they&#13;
are common practice among developed countries and there are important&#13;
reasons for tax coordination between host and home countries0&#13;
Without tax coordination, tax incentives of developing countries&#13;
can be offset by the tax system of a home country and can lead to a&#13;
transfer of tax revenue from host to home country0 If the taxation&#13;
of "international income" by both home and host countries is not&#13;
coordinated, an additional burden may be imposed on that income as&#13;
compared with domestic income, additional benefits might be granted&#13;
for that income, or tax evasion might be facilitated0 One of the main&#13;
problems of private investment--transfer pricing--certainly cannot be&#13;
handled without tax coordination0 Three models of standardization of&#13;
bilateral tax treaties exist: the Mexico (1943) and London (1946)&#13;
Model Tax Conventions and the OECD Model Convention (1963). 11&#13;
V0 THE POLICIES OF HOME COUNTRIES TOWARD PRIVATE DIRECT FOREIGN&#13;
INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
For the governments of home countries, private investment&#13;
abroad has to be viewed primarily in the context of its impact on their&#13;

(Paris: OECD, 1977).&#13;
&#13;

macroeconomic goals, that is, growth and employment and associated&#13;
balance of payments issues. Some also seek to strengthen their inter-&#13;
national, political and economic position by private investment. Private&#13;
investment has also sometimes been used an as instrument of development&#13;
policy.&#13;
The basic issue in home country policies toward private&#13;
investment is compatibility between macroeconomic goals and international&#13;
economic objectives. As long as governments do not have serious&#13;
problems in achieving their macroeconomic objectives, they remain re-&#13;
latively unconcerned about private investment. They focus on questions&#13;
like compensation for nationalized properties or evidence of discrimination&#13;
against investment originating in their countries, and they sometimes&#13;
consider private investment as an instrument for helping developing&#13;
countries achieve their economic and social objectives. As a result,&#13;
from the 1950s to the mid-1970s, home country policies either ignored&#13;
or favored the flow of private investment to developing countries.&#13;
Some home governments provided incentives for investment out-&#13;
flows to developing countries until the middle of the 1970s. Balance&#13;
of payments difficulties then led some to adopt restrictive measures,&#13;
but these were in effect for only limited periods of time. However,&#13;
given relatively high unemployment, home countries have now become concerned&#13;
with conflicts between their macroeconomic goals and international economic&#13;
objectives. The concern applies especially to home countries with con-&#13;
siderable foreign investment outflows that are related to the creation&#13;
of "off shore" export bases. /1 The issues are not related to private&#13;
investme!t as such, but rather to host country policies which sub-&#13;
sidize inward private investment and pull jobs or exports away from the&#13;
home country. Host government requirements that a considerable share&#13;
of the production of an enterprise be exported or that high technology&#13;
exports be built up have emphasized the need to reconsider home country&#13;
policies.&#13;
The attacks on home country subsidies to investment outflows&#13;
have been spearheaded by labor unions, but the unions have been joined&#13;
by businessmen threatened by imports from developing countries, as well&#13;
as by some government officials and academics who have become concerned&#13;
with the long-term impact of the loss of capital investment. The&#13;
growing concern centers primarily around the problem of "exporting&#13;
jobs" from home countries because of subsidies and other distortions in&#13;
host countries. On the other hand, growing subsidies in home countries&#13;

discriminate against investment outflows. /1&#13;
Whether the current concern over the impact of inv@stment&#13;
outflows on the export of jobs is only the beginning of growing opgosition&#13;
remains to be seen. In any case, home governments are aware thet .&#13;
investment represents a transfer of production potential and there:fore&#13;
has implications for the international division of production.&#13;
Unfortunately, existing knowledge about the total         o of&#13;
private investment on home countries is very limited and does not ?,Fo-&#13;
vide a sufficient basis for rational discussion of the isSues, let,&#13;
alone for the formulation of appropriate policies. Private inves2ment&#13;
flows are certainly not a zero-sum game but home and host countrioe do&#13;
not benefit automatically, particularly if one party discriminateo&#13;
against competitive market trends. Such interventions can make it&#13;
possible, in principle, for a group of semi-industrialized and otlO.r&#13;
relatively advanced developing countries to gain a disproportionate&#13;
share of the industrial investments of industrielized countriesD, w:th&#13;
possible repercussions on the rate of growth of industrial investw.ent&#13;

products are concerned, Within countries, moreover, not all E      :&#13;
gain0 Dividing up the benefits , even when two countries agree both&#13;
will gain, is not simple0&#13;
Home governments have three principal policy choices:&#13;
- Private investments can be treated the same way as &amp;omestic&#13;
investments, that is private investment-related policles cra&#13;
be based on the principle of capital export neutral!ty;&#13;
-  There can be discrimination against private investmeni;&#13;
- A policy of promoting private investment in developl.v2&#13;
countries can be pursued with or wi-^thout discriminnaa102;&#13;
against investment which has adverse effects on the d6osetic&#13;
job market0&#13;
A0 The Principle of Capital Export Neutrality&#13;
The political conflicts that involve private investment are&#13;
essentially those of trade-related policies0 /2 The state is infl-aenced&#13;
by powerful interest groups and therefore is not neutral.   In home-&#13;

countries, two groups have special interest in private investment-related&#13;
policies: transnational corporations and labor unions. While trans-&#13;
national corporations, with their strong desire for trade liberalization&#13;
and capital movements, are supported by other internationaily-oriented&#13;
groups such as retail corporations with import interests, farmers with&#13;
export interests and consumers, labor unions often find support from&#13;
industries seeking protection against imports in general and against&#13;
imports from foreign affiliates of transnational corporations in particular.&#13;
Workers trade off benefits of employment against cheaper goods. With the&#13;
spread of transnational corporations' activities abroad,- there has been&#13;
an increased differentiation in attitudes toward private investment.&#13;
At present, arguments vary from industry to industry according to the&#13;
specific interests at stake.&#13;
Modern political parties usually contain representatives from&#13;
both groups--liberal and protectionist--but in general favor either&#13;
liberalism or protectionism. Within many home governments, the various&#13;
ministries may also have different attitudes. It is not surprising that&#13;
policies toward private investment often are contradictory and that&#13;
incentives as well as disincentives can be found at the same time within&#13;
the same home country. The result is that peculiar combination of pro-&#13;
tectionism and liberalization which characterizes policies toward&#13;
private investment in many home countries.&#13;
The view that policies toward private investment should be&#13;
more neutral should be seen in this context. Capital export neutrality,&#13;
that is, the equal treatment of foreign and domestic investment would in-&#13;
volve balancing the attitudes of pressure groups toward foreign investment,&#13;
making it easier for governments to defend themselves against the pressures&#13;
of transnational corporations and labor unions. However, implementation&#13;
of the neutrality principle is very difficult politically. For example,&#13;
in the field of taxes, true neutrality would mean that, where foreign&#13;
taxes are higher than domestic taxes, transnational corporations should&#13;
receive a payment from the government of the home country. Capital&#13;
export neutrality requires that host countries increase their taxes&#13;
to the levels of home countries to avoid subsidizing the latter. /1&#13;
Tax sparing (permitting tax holidays in host countries as deductions&#13;
from tax payable in home countries) would not be allowed. Not to&#13;
permit tax sharing is often viewed as a hostile act toward developing&#13;
countries, even though it discourages tax exemption incentive races among&#13;
them. In the field of risk insurance, neutrality could mean that all&#13;
private investment would receive guarantees against all political risks.&#13;
It is sometimes even argued that a strict neutrality approach would not&#13;

- 30 -&#13;
permit adjustment assistance for firms and workers displaced as a&#13;
result of private investment because it is not available for other&#13;
firms affected by structural changes, but this view is antramse&#13;
Even if it is not possible to implement neutrality fully,&#13;
the principle can nevertheless serve as a guide in devising investment&#13;
outflow policies.    It can serve as a relatively unambiguous basis for&#13;
the reconciliation of currently contradictory policies and for the&#13;
reduction of excessive incentives or disincentives. As long as there&#13;
are no bilateral or multilateral arrangements restricting the use of&#13;
excessive incentives to private investment in host countrie@s the&#13;
principle of capital export neutrality can also serve as a basis for&#13;
potential countermeasures by home countries. Finally, the neutrality&#13;
principle could also be a point of departure for specific policies that&#13;
would use private investment as an instrument to promote development&#13;
in the least developed countries0&#13;
As transnational corporations becoms more international in&#13;
outlook, they are adapting to the conditions of host countries&#13;
without paying much attention to the impact on the homes economy. They&#13;
have learned that if they want to cc:nduct business internationally, they&#13;
have to do so without regard for the needs of the home country. They&#13;
will not move in certain directions unless induced or forced by governments&#13;
to do so. If host governments, however, harness transnational cor-&#13;
porations to direct the benefits of private investment in their favor,&#13;
home country governments will stop followaing policies of non-=interference0&#13;
B. Discrimination against Private Investment Flows&#13;
A strategy of discrimination against private investment can&#13;
involve the following options:&#13;
- General discrimination against private investment compared&#13;
to domestic investment, that is, following policies that&#13;
are the opposite of neutrality;&#13;
- Discrimination on a case-by-case basci , with the intention&#13;
of avoiding adverse effects from private investmaent on the&#13;
economy of the home country, in particular on domsotic&#13;
employment,&#13;
- Discrimination against "beyond-reasonable-norm policies"&#13;
of host country governments to offset the inducements they&#13;
offer to private investment0&#13;
General Discrimination&#13;
Knowledge of the impact of private investment on the hom@&#13;
economy is limited, not least because there has been much more anmsysis&#13;
of the costs and benefits of private investment for host countriso than&#13;
for home countrieso For example, there is insufficient empirical knowledge&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
about such important subjects as what would happen in the long-term&#13;
if there were a shift from domestic to foreign investment. /1 There&#13;
are some indications that the balance of payments effects on home countries&#13;
would be less 'avorable than is assumed under the neoclassic view. /2&#13;
Even less information is available about the impact of private investment&#13;
on home country employment. Despite the lack of knowledge, however,&#13;
in some cases governments have begun to devise policies to restrict&#13;
the use of incentive for "runaway industries." /3&#13;
The question of whether over the medium to long term the positive&#13;
effects of private investment on the development of new markets, the&#13;

in P. H. Ady,(ed.),Private Foreign Investments and the Developing&#13;
World (New York: Praeger, 1971), pp. 10-16. P. H. Ady's analysis is&#13;
based upon two major surveys of the effects of foreign investment on&#13;
the economies of the US and UK. One was conducted by G. C. Hufbauer&#13;
and J. Adler (Overseas Manufacturing Investment and the Balance of&#13;
Payments, Tax Policy Research Study No. 1, US Treasury Department, Washington,&#13;
D.C., 1968), the other by W. B. Reddaway et al (Effects of U.K.&#13;
Direct Investment Overseas, DAE Occasional Paper No. 15, Cambridge&#13;
University Press, 1967 and 1968). These studies suggest that in the very&#13;
long run outward foreign investment benefits the balance of payments,&#13;
but in the short run the net balance of payments effect may be&#13;
adverse. An earlier study by Philip W. Bell, "Private Capital&#13;
Movements and the U.S. Balance-of-Payments" in Factors Affecting the&#13;
United States Balance of Payments, Joint Economic Committee. 87th&#13;
Congress, 2nd Session,(Washington, D.C., 1962,) pp.395-481 concluded&#13;
that growth of US private investment between 1952-56 and 1957-61 had had&#13;
a deteriorating effect on the US balance of payments and that the&#13;
"catching up period with regard to the related inflows could be&#13;
longer than 10-15 years" (p. 459).&#13;
3/ In the United States, for instance, OPIC (Overseas Private Investment&#13;
Corporation) is specifically prohibited from supporting runaway&#13;
industries. OPIC was established as an agency of the US government&#13;
to mobilize and facilitate the participation of US private capital&#13;
and expertise in the development of the developing countries through&#13;
two programs: one, the financing of projects sponsored by US investors;&#13;
the second, insuring US private investment in developing countries&#13;
against political risks. OPIC does discriminate against enterprises&#13;
which might have adverse effects on the domestic job market. Decisions&#13;
to do so are based on case-by-case evaluation of the possible effect&#13;
of the proposed projects on balance of payments and employment, parti-&#13;
cularly via an analysis of the expected trade effects.&#13;

creation of new trade possibilities, the safeguarding of supplies of&#13;
raw materials and the general expansion of activities of the domestic&#13;
economy into the international economy will exceed the negative effects,&#13;
particularly on employment, remains open. It is extremely difficult&#13;
to evaluate the real impact of private investment, especially on em-&#13;
ployment in home countries. Study results largely depend on the&#13;
assumptions used and are accordingly contradictory. /1 Thus there is&#13;
no reliable empirical knowledge about the long-term impact of private&#13;
investment on the home country's employment. The short-term effects&#13;
are generally thought to be less favorable for the home country than&#13;
the long-term effects. /2 Given the absence of adequate information,&#13;
home country policies that discriminate against private investment over-&#13;
all are not based on empirical-rational grounds, unless the home country's&#13;
intent is to rely exclusively on "pure" trade in its international&#13;
economic relations.&#13;
Discrimination on a Case-by-Case Basis&#13;
It is important to distinguish between home country policies&#13;
which discriminate against private investment in general and policies&#13;
which exclude specific cases of private investment from the incentives&#13;
offered by the home government. Private investment can have negative&#13;
employment effects regardless of the sector. Even investments in mining&#13;
and agriculture can have a negative impact, at least as far as competitive&#13;

United States reveals, using a "reasonable" combination of assumptions,&#13;
a difference of from plus 279,000 to minus 660,000 jobs.   See Robert   4&#13;

The conclusion reached in a series of nine case studies is that&#13;

raw materials and foodstuffs are concerned. However, the main reper-&#13;
cussions usually come from investments in processing industries and&#13;
manufacturing. They will differ from industry to industry and also&#13;
depend on the protection-incentive structures in home and host. zountries.&#13;
It seems likely that a relatively unambiguous answer to the problem of&#13;
the impact of private investment on employment in the home country&#13;
can only be found by evaluating each case. /1 This approach makes it&#13;
possible to take into consideration differences among production sectors&#13;
and the particular trade relations between the foreign enterprise and&#13;
the parent and other home country firms. The main focus of case-by-case&#13;
evaluations would be on the extent of replacement of present and future&#13;
exports and domestic sales of the parent and other firms of the home&#13;
country by the foreign enterprise and on the exports of investment&#13;
goods, parts, components and services from the home country to the&#13;
foreign enterprise. /2 Although it may be impossible to evaluate all&#13;
the medium- and long-term effects on trade diversion and trade creation&#13;
caused by a given private investment outflow, /3 only this kind of evaluation&#13;
can suggest which ventures might have adverse effects on domestic&#13;
employment, the balance of payments and other variables. Such a policy&#13;
would probably discriminate against private investment in manufacturing.&#13;
1/ In all probability, however, an evaluation at the subsector level will&#13;
not provide sufficient information. See Kenneth S. Mericle, The,&#13;
Brazilian Motor Vehicle Industry, Its Role in Brazilian Development&#13;
and Its Impact on United States Employment, a report prepared for the&#13;
Office of Foreign Economic Research, US Department of Labor, Washington,&#13;
D.C., July 1975.&#13;
2/ Particularly in the United States, the basis for information regarding&#13;
the effects of private investment on the home economy is systematically&#13;
being improved. The questionnaire of the 1977 Benchmark Survey of U.S.&#13;
Direct Investment Abroad contains detailed questions about the trade&#13;
relations connected with private investment. See"Memorandum to companies&#13;
that may be required to report in the Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct&#13;
Investment Abroad - 1977," (Washington, D.C.: Bureau of Economic Analysis,&#13;
US Department of Commerce, November 9, 1977), pp.A9-AlO, Bll and B16-B17.&#13;

investment on trade fl&amp;ws, as viewed from the host country, are dis-&#13;

Flows of Less Developed Countries," World Development, Vol. 2, No. 2,&#13;

Discrimition aainst "Beond-Reasonable-Norm" Policies of&#13;
Host Governments&#13;
A policy of case-specific discrimination can also be based on&#13;
an evaluation of the policies of host country governments. It would be&#13;
analogous to foreign trade policies which allow for countervailing&#13;
duties against export subsidies or dumping practlccs by foreign&#13;
governments , and would involve the development of instruments which&#13;
can be used by home countries to counter policies of host countries&#13;
that discriminate heavily and beyondreasonable-norms in favor of&#13;
private investment inflows. Such countervailing policies of home&#13;
countries could include measures to remove incentives (for example,&#13;
substitution of a deduction treatment of foreign taxes for tax credits),&#13;
as well as actions that discriminate directly against private investment&#13;
in some host countries (increasing taxation to offset tax incentives&#13;
of the host country, for instance)0   However, countervailing policies&#13;
in the field of private investment eould not only be highly arbitrary,&#13;
but would probably lead to a series of retaliatory and counter-re-&#13;
taliatory measures beween host and home countrieso As effective in.ter-&#13;
nationally agreed private investment rules are not likely to emerge&#13;
in the near future, tax treaties between host and home countries offer a&#13;
possibility of negotiating a compromise that uould satisfy all three&#13;
parties--the transaational corporations and the home and the host&#13;
governments. The alternative may be "investmeant wars." /1&#13;
C. Using Private ForeigA Direct Investment as an Instrument of Development&#13;
Policy&#13;
The strategy of using private investment as an instrument of&#13;
development policy raises the following issuesg&#13;
(a)  Whether and under what circumstances private inveotment&#13;
can contribute to the achievement of the economic and&#13;
social goals of the host country (in the sense that the&#13;
benefits of foreign investment would exceed the costs&#13;
to the host country);&#13;
(b) Whether and how policies to promote foreign investment&#13;
should be differentiated according to the needs of differing&#13;
groups of developing countries.&#13;
Existing knowledge about the contribution of private investment&#13;
to the achievement of development objectives is again not sufficient for&#13;
unequivocal conclusions. It can certainly be argued that the effects of&#13;
private investment in the host country largely depend on the circumstances&#13;
under which foreign investors conduct their business0 In the past,&#13;
excessively protectionist environments have led to high costs of private&#13;

investment for developing countries. Host country governments were too&#13;
weak to harness the energies of twholly-owned subsidiaries of powerful&#13;
transnational corporations to meet their ends. More recently, however,&#13;
host countr-y governments have been in a position to direct and even&#13;
control foreign firms. Their bargaining power has increased considerably&#13;
because of growing competition among foreign investors. Yet, despite&#13;
the greater strength of host governments and their increasing control,&#13;
a growing number of firms have been ready to conduct business in developing&#13;
countries under new arrangements which make it easier to direct private&#13;
investment toward meeting a host country's development needs. Under&#13;
these new conditions, private investment can be considered as having&#13;
potentially important contributions to make to the development of the&#13;
host countries, particularly with respect to the transfer of such non-&#13;
financial factors as technology and management skills.&#13;
The changing nature of private investment and the changing&#13;
environment in developing countries suggest that home countries can&#13;
use private investment as a contribution to development. However,&#13;
in devising policies to promote private investment in developing&#13;
countries, it is relevant to note that the decisions of transnational&#13;
corporations on private investment are made relatively independently of&#13;
incentives provided by home countries.&#13;
If private investment is to be used as an instrument for&#13;
development, a consideration must be whether present home country policies&#13;
should move away from generalized promotional systems toward a greater&#13;
degree of selectivity, /1 for the following reasons:&#13;
i) Given the lack of knowledge about the long-term effects&#13;
of private investment on home country economies (particularly&#13;
on employment), and given the growing opposition toward&#13;
outward investment flows, there is need for caution in&#13;
promoting private investment. Consideration should be&#13;
given to the degree of need for private investment in the&#13;
various groups of developing countries and their relative&#13;
ability to attract it in normal ways;&#13;
ii) If the present trend of concentration of private investment&#13;
in the middle and upper income developing countries con-&#13;
tinues, the poorer developing countries are likely to find&#13;
it difficult to attract private investment.&#13;
1/ In the following discussion, the focus is on selectivity by income&#13;
group. Other possibilities for differentiating promotional measures&#13;
are by sectors or factor-intensity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 &#13;
A distinction can be made between two groups of developing&#13;
countries: rapidly industrializing OPEC countries and other developing&#13;
countries with well-advanced industrial sectors (middle income countries)&#13;
on the one hand, and all other developing countries (low income countries)&#13;
on the other. The various policies home countries can use to promote&#13;
private investment can be correlated to these two groupso Such policies&#13;
can involve&#13;
- fiscal incentives1,&#13;
-  trade measures,&#13;
- insurance measures and&#13;
- direct measures to support cooperation between the private&#13;
sector of the home country and developing countrieso&#13;
Fiscal Incentives&#13;
Fiscal incentives for private investment, particularly in the&#13;
form of preferential tax treatment of foreign income and incentives&#13;
corresponding to the amounts of capital invested, are an integral part&#13;
of the tax structure of home countries, There are considerable differences&#13;
in tax structures and tax incentives between countries1, but, for the&#13;
purpose of this paper, they may be thought of as tax incentives whatever&#13;
form they may take0 /1&#13;
Tax incentives can be defined as a differeace in tax treatment&#13;
between domestic and private investments in home countries0 They comprise&#13;
special measures which discriminate in favor of or against private&#13;
investment0 Such measures generally favor or discriminate against private&#13;
investment uniformly, whether if flows to developed or developing countries,&#13;
and not according to the type of country of destination0 In addition to&#13;
measures dealing specifically with private invastmen', most homa&#13;
countries use other fiscal measures which favor domestic investment0 For&#13;
example, it is often not clear whether the net impact of the home country&#13;
tax system on private investment (whether it flows to developing countries&#13;
or to developed countries) is negative or positive, even where the home&#13;
country's general policy is to support private investment.0 /2  Y@t if&#13;
a home country wants to promote private investment in developing countries&#13;
or in certain groups of developing countries, it iG essential that the&#13;
overall effects of the various tax measures on private investment be&#13;
positive as compared with domestic investments0   Heasures to  abolish&#13;
tax discrimination against private investment are frequently more important&#13;
than the elaboration of incentive measures0 In these instances, the&#13;
implementation of the neutrality principle (equal treatment of domestic&#13;

and private investment) could be regarded as a move toward an improved&#13;
treatment of private investment.&#13;
If -ome country governments want to support the Lransfer of&#13;
technology and managerial expertise in connection with private investment&#13;
or even by themselves, tax incentives related to foreign income could&#13;
also cover foreign income from licensing, management or technical&#13;
assistance contracts, etc., and differentiate according to groups of&#13;
developing countries.  The transfer of intangibles could be regarded&#13;
as more important to development than financial transfers. This con-&#13;
sideration could lead to more favorable tax treatment for foreign&#13;
income deriving from the transfer of "developmental intangibles" than&#13;
for foreign income from financial investments.&#13;
Which developing countries the home country should benefit with&#13;
tax incentives is of course an important issue. The more advanced&#13;
developing countries are able either to attract or constrain private&#13;
investment through their own policies, whereas the low income developing&#13;
countries have found it difficult to attract sizeable flows. This may&#13;
lead to the conclusion that tax incentives should be confined to private&#13;
investment in the latter countries. This would also meet the growing&#13;
opposition in developed countries to the promotion of private investment&#13;
in developing countries with rapidly growing industrial output&#13;
and exports. Combining fiscal incentives with a differentiation between&#13;
different groups of developing countries could thus offer a possibility&#13;
of simultaneously promoting development goals while avoiding adverse&#13;
effects on the home economy.&#13;
Trade Policies&#13;
Trade policies of the developed countries discriminate in&#13;
favor of manufactured imports from developing countries through the&#13;
Generalized Scheme of Preferences and through remission of duty on&#13;
imports of components. With the decline of tariffs in the developed&#13;
countries, the value of these concessions has also declined, but firms&#13;
and labor affected by the export activities of transnational corporations&#13;
in developing countries have objected to these concessions nevertheless,&#13;
particularly where trade concessions have been combined with incentives&#13;
to capital flows for this purpose and where the host countries have been&#13;
relatively high income countries. The situation has been exacerbated&#13;
where the host country has also given incentives to exporters. For&#13;
lower income countries, however, the combination of trade concessions&#13;
with incentives for private investment outflows potentially could&#13;
stimulate exports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Insurance Measures&#13;
To date, 16 OECD countries have established systems of political&#13;
guarantees for the flows of private investment to developing countries. /1&#13;
Promotional insurance measures include investment insurance or guarantee&#13;
schemes against the risks of war, expropriation and inconvertibility&#13;
of currency, as well as bilateral investment protection agreements.&#13;
These promotional insurance measures, which seek to establish a safe&#13;
investment environment in developing countries, should be handled&#13;
without differentiatior. among developing countries0&#13;
Measures to Suort Cooperation betweean the Private Sector&#13;
of the Home Country and Dev             tries&#13;
The dissemination of information about investment opportunities&#13;
to pctential investors, the bringing together of potential investors&#13;
of home countries with partners in host countries, the provision of&#13;
technical assistance and financing for pre-investment surveys and feasibility&#13;
studiesg, assistance to potential partners in finding additional&#13;
financial sources , and the supplementing of financing of projects ty&#13;
participating in equity and loan financing, either through a public&#13;
investment corporation or by government aid agencies--all can be&#13;
effective measures in stimulating investment flows0 in a number of&#13;
OECD countries, most or all of these types of directly supportive&#13;
activities are undertaken by a special government-sponsored organization,&#13;
which sometimes also operates a guarantee system0 While the non-financial&#13;
measures (information, feasibility studies, etc.) could be implemented&#13;
for all developing countries, consideration could be given to restricting&#13;
financial support for private investment to the lower income developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
D. The Need for Adjustment Assi.stance&#13;
Over time, outflows of foreign investment will lead to a&#13;
restructuring of the home country economy0 There is generally a&#13;
shift from domestic production to exports and in the composition of&#13;
exports. Such restructuring is a continuous processD analogous to the&#13;
restructuring resulting from changes in tastes, technology, the&#13;
competitiveness of other countries, and other causes0 While the&#13;
economy as a whole gains in such shifts, the firms and workers affected&#13;

Experience of OECD in Promoting Investment Among OECD Countries and&#13;

by the closing down of plants pay most of the costs. Hence there is&#13;
a strong argument for assisting them in making the adjustment. This&#13;
is likely to be particularly necessary in a period of slow overall&#13;
economic g;owth. The case for adjustment assistance for firms and&#13;
workers displaced by investment flows to developing countries is no&#13;
different ir principle to similar measures taken in response to shifts&#13;
in production resulting from investment flows to developed countries and&#13;
to shifts resulting from non-trade causes. However, fears of "cheap&#13;
labor" competition from developing countries may make the political&#13;
case for adjustment assistance stronger in many instances. The&#13;
case for adjustment assistance in relation to private investment is&#13;
principally a trade adjustment case that has been made elsewhere.&#13;
Since its importance is recognized, the arguments are not repeated&#13;
in this paper.&#13;
Adjustment of the economies of developed countries to the&#13;
increase in exports of manufactures, especially by the advanced developing&#13;
countries, may also require some negotiations over "orderly marketing"&#13;
between developed and developing countries, as well as discussions&#13;
among developed countries with regard to their trade performance&#13;
vis-a-vis developing countries, analogous to the aid performance rounds&#13;
of the Development Assistance Committee of OECD.&#13;
VI. THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS&#13;
Past and potential conflicts concerning private investment&#13;
have led to arguments for international action. It is thought that a&#13;
framework of international rules could forestall national legislation&#13;
and policies which discriminate against private investment flows from&#13;
home countries and subsidize the flow of investment to host countries&#13;
or otherwise distort international comparative advantage. /1 It would,&#13;
of course, be nalve to argue against all "discrimination" and "distortion"&#13;
because such policies are often introduced to correct other, previous,&#13;
departures from a notional competitive equilibrium. The main concern&#13;
is not with the activities of transnational corporations as such, but&#13;
with measures taken by governments of host and home countries that&#13;
cause major distortions in foreign flows, which then lead to a spiral&#13;
of countermeasures. /2 A code of good business conduct is sometimes&#13;

the Multir.ationals: Problems and Prospects," Foreign Affairs, Vol. 55,&#13;
No. 2, 1977, p. 255. He points to a powerful element in US thinking&#13;
according to which the United States should use its bargaining power&#13;
unilaterally and reduce its participation in international institutions&#13;
such as GATT, IMF, UN, etc.&#13;

that they will not exploit loopholes and contradictiona in national&#13;
policies. /1 A new type of international firm, vary clos6ly linked&#13;

Despite the many approaches to re_i    l r'r private inv@Gtmant&#13;
internationally, the outlook for effective inte.asational action scoms&#13;
poor. Even such limited schemes as a proposed m    tle eral invastment&#13;
guarantee scheme have not succeeded0 /2 Other initiativesD msinly&#13;
consisting of "codes of conduct," would only be applicable at a very&#13;
general level, if at all, and therefore cannot be considered effective&#13;
means of international regulation0 13&#13;
The attempts at concerted international action have fai_lad&#13;
for several reasons0 Many developing countries b(lAsvs that they are&#13;
at a fundamental disadvantage which would be further elxacrbated by&#13;
international arrangements0 They are more lillly to coordinats their&#13;
policies with one country than to find a solution in a global framework. /4&#13;
Some developed countries fear that international               could&#13;
threaten the liberal principles of the world economy and lead to ga&#13;
international bureaucracy administering markets atd prices, Many&#13;
governments are simply' reluctant to have their policy choices countrained&#13;
by international regulations0   Their reluctance is all the greatez&#13;
because private investment flows are linked to the future international&#13;
division of industrial production0&#13;

transnational corporations in more explicit terms run the risk of&#13;
exacerbating them. /1 An international agreement regulating private&#13;
investment flow' on lines analogous to GATT, which deals with taxation,&#13;
antitrust policy'. foreign exchange controls, export controls a.nd&#13;

against discrimination against or in favor of private investment (with&#13;
the respective safeguard clauses) on the other, accordingly seems&#13;
beyond the bounds of political feasibility in the foreseeable future.&#13;
Improvement of policies affecting private investment in&#13;
home and host countries remains the key to facilitating a steady flow&#13;
of private investment to developing countries. Nevertheless, there&#13;
are some important multilateral approaches which can complement efforts&#13;
at national and bilateral levels. First, OECD has emerged as the&#13;
central institution for policy harmonization with respect to private&#13;
investment among developed countries. Its activities have involved&#13;
not only the elaboration of many documents and papers which have been&#13;
extremely useful in paving the road to a better understanding of the&#13;
problems involved, /3 but also to a certain harmonization of policies&#13;
toward transnational corporations. /4   However, these results have been&#13;
1/ The limited possibilities for international action among governments&#13;
in the field of foreign investment are paralleled by a similarly&#13;
narrow potential for an international strategy of labor unions toward&#13;
transnational corporations. Robert W. Cox, "Labor and the Multinationals,"&#13;

possible only by relying on relatively informal methods and arrangements.&#13;
In particular, the guidelines for multinational enterprises, to be&#13;
applied on a voluntary basis, can be seen as a firat step in achieving&#13;
a higher degree of policy coordination, even though codes of that kind&#13;
inevitably leave the central issues unresolved. The developed countries&#13;
could not police it effectively even if they wanted to0 More important&#13;
than the OECD code, however, is the fact that the developed countries&#13;
have succeeded in creating informal and consultative procedures for&#13;
handling problems related to private investment.&#13;
Second, many initiatives will be carried on throug. various&#13;
UN organizations1, mainly through the Centre on Transnational Corporatione&#13;
and UNCTADO Ongoing activities within the UN relate above all to. /1&#13;
- The establishment of a technical cooperation program to&#13;
assist governments of host countries in dealing with&#13;
transnational corporations;&#13;
- Elaboration of a general code of conduct;&#13;
- Development of a comprehensive information system, including&#13;
information on contracts and agreements between host country&#13;
entities and transnational corporations;&#13;
- International action on the problem of corrupt practices;&#13;

reporting;&#13;

such as UNIDO's activities in industrial pre-investment&#13;
surveys1, industrial management training, assistance to&#13;
local institutions active in the field of industrialisation,&#13;
formulation of industrial development plans, etc.&#13;
Third, the role of the multilateral devslopment banks in the&#13;
field of private investment has to be seen against the background of their&#13;
activities at project and sector levels. Greater efforts by these institutions&#13;

would be conceivable in the following directions:&#13;
-  To reinforce at the project level their activities as&#13;
financiers and catalysts, particularly through participation&#13;
in more projects and in organizing whole packages, i.e.&#13;
bringing together all the partners concerned with their&#13;
respective financial and non-financial contributions; /1&#13;
- To encourage the role of development finance corporations&#13;
and other institutions in the field of private investment&#13;
by helping them build up capacities to handle commercial&#13;
banks with' an industrial clientele (this option applies&#13;
especially to the low income countries);&#13;
- To promote the establishment of centers for industrial and&#13;
technological cooperation between developing countries&#13;
(primarily low income countries) and the private sector&#13;
of the developed (or semi-industrialized) countries, the&#13;
main purpose being to organize the flow of skills, technology&#13;
and marketing expertise.&#13;
- To support the development of industrial free zones and&#13;
domestic industrial estates (for foreign and local entre-&#13;
preneurs) within the context of the industrial development&#13;
policies of the countries concerned and with regard to&#13;
world and regional markets;&#13;
- To help developing countries (in particular low income&#13;
countries) in systematically building up a project pipeline&#13;
for foreign investors within the framework of sectoral&#13;
and subsectoral development programs.&#13;
To sum up, international institutions in the field of private&#13;
investment have worked out a fairly reasonable division of labor. There&#13;
are groupings of countries trying to harmonize some foreign investment-&#13;
related policies according to the special neeas of their member countries--&#13;
such as OECD or, with different objectives, the Andean Common Market.&#13;
The UN system provides a global approach, serving primarily as a basis&#13;
for common activities and proceedings among developing countries&#13;
and between developing and developed countries. The role of the multi-&#13;
lateral banks is characterized by activities in development financing and&#13;
aid, mainly at the project and sectoral level. While the UN technical&#13;
cooperation program centers on helping developing countries deal with&#13;
transnational corporations, the banks act as financiers and catalysts&#13;
and could assist developing countries in building up a closer network of&#13;
cooperation with the private sector of developed countries. A global&#13;
approach to the regulation of transnational corporations and policies&#13;
of host and home countries is not feasible, at least for the time being.&#13;

ANNEX I: STATISTICS&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
As the text indicates, the character of private direct foreign&#13;
investment has been changing: from equity participation to the use of&#13;
loans and suppliers' credits; from direct parent control over manage-&#13;
ment to participation in management, technical agreements, production-&#13;
sharing, supply contracts, etc. These changes have led the transnational&#13;
corporations to shift their participation from ownership and financial&#13;
contributions to technical assistance and other activities which&#13;
facilitate the transfer of management, technology, etc., to host countries.&#13;
The current statistical conventions clearly do not have provi-&#13;
sions for these changes. To do so, statistical categories would have&#13;
to be adjusted as follows:&#13;
- The definition of private direct foreign investment would&#13;
have to be enlarged by including the other relevant&#13;
categories while maintaining equity participation (with-&#13;
out floor limits) and management participation through&#13;
management contracts as preconditions. Thus, private&#13;
investment would include: (i) equity participation&#13;
without floor limits; (ii) reinvested earnings; (iii)&#13;
other short- and long-term flows from the foreign investor(s);&#13;
(iv) long-term flows from third parties; and (v) export&#13;
credits from third parties.&#13;
- A new category--perhaps under the common heading of "private&#13;
flows to enterprises with equity and management participation"&#13;
--would have to be established in addition to that of&#13;
presently defined investment. Thus the private flows&#13;
to enterprises would be comprised of the following two&#13;
separate groups of categories:&#13;
( i) Categories presently defined as private investment:&#13;
-   equity participation above X percent&#13;
-   reinvested earnings&#13;
-   other short- and long-term flows from the equity&#13;
investment(s)&#13;
(ii) Categories which should also be included:&#13;
-   equity participation below X percent&#13;
-   reinvested earnings&#13;
-   other short- and long-term flows from the equity&#13;
investor(s)&#13;
-   long-term flows from other foreign parties&#13;
-   export credits from third parties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX I&#13;

Such an approach would have the advantage of allowing for a comparison&#13;
of traditional private investment and private investment with new&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
Existing knowledge about non-financial components such as&#13;
licensing and other agreements (for the use of trademaarks, patents,&#13;
processes, industrial know-how and other intangible property),&#13;
service contracts (management, training, engineering services, etc.)&#13;
R&amp;D in the foreign enterprises and long-term supply contracts is&#13;
severely limited. Even the 1977 benchmark survey of US foreign direct&#13;
investments will not provide sufficient information about service&#13;
contracts or R&amp;D activities in foreign enterprises when its results&#13;
become available in 1982 or so. /1 Therefore, compiling data in this&#13;
area will mean starting from scratch, with all the technical dif-&#13;
ficulties this entails. /2 However, without more information about&#13;
those components1, it will not be possible to direct host and home&#13;
countries' policies toward the transfer of technology which is mainly&#13;
connected with private investment, /3 or to analyze the effect of that&#13;
transfer on growth, trade, employment, etc., in both host and home&#13;
countries.&#13;
Any major change in statistics will require an agreement&#13;
among governments on data compilation and their full cooperation in&#13;
its implementation. Governments will be reluctant to change categories&#13;
and methods unless they are convinced there is a policy need to do so.&#13;
Even under the most favorable circumstances, it would take several&#13;
years to change the compilation of data about private investment. /4&#13;
Therefore, at least for the time being, there is no alternative but to&#13;

limitations are discussed in the subsequent paragraphs.&#13;
B. Data&#13;
Global, data for private direct foreign investment were obtained&#13;
primarily from OECD data (DAC figures) and national sources. The OECD&#13;
data cover private investment flows from developed countries to developing&#13;
countries by investor countries, by recipient countries and by sectors,&#13;
and also cover stocks by recipient regions and by sectors. IMF balance&#13;
of payments data are available for each recipient developing country.&#13;
National data have also been obtained from the US, Japan, West&#13;
Germany, the UK and France.&#13;
Because of the difference in sources and coverage of the&#13;
various sets of data, much care is required in comparing investment&#13;
figures.&#13;
Standard Definition of Private Direct Foreign Investment&#13;
Private direct foreign investment is defined by the IMF /1&#13;
as investment in enterprises located in one country but effectively&#13;
controlled by residents of another country. As a rule, it takes the&#13;
form of investment in branches and subsidiaries. Since effective&#13;
control of a company is sometimes difficult to determine, some working&#13;
rules have been adopted: effective control is inferred from (i) 50%&#13;
or more ownership of the voting stock by residents in an investor&#13;
country, or (ii) 25% or more ownership by a single holder or organized&#13;
groups of holders in an investor country, or (iii) the existence of&#13;
specific groups of residents in an investor country represented on&#13;
the board of directors. /2&#13;
1/  IMF, IMF Balance of Payments Yearbook - concepts and definitions&#13;
(Washington D.C.: International Monetary Fund, November 1964, Vol.16).&#13;
2/ Based on its recent survey of direct investment, the IMF indicates&#13;
that countries rely heavily on the minimum percentage of foreign&#13;
ownership to identify private investment, but individual country&#13;
practices diverge substantially: some countries adopt a uniform&#13;
percentage ownership ranging from 5% to more than 50%, irrespective&#13;
of diffusion of investors or the number of investing countries;&#13;
others adppt varying minimum percentage criteria according to the&#13;
degree of diffusion of investors and investing countries. The IMF&#13;
appears to admit this different treatment in use in the new&#13;
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual, rather than presenting&#13;
as a recommendation a unique quantitative criterion of foreign&#13;
ownership. See IMF, Balance of Payments Manual, Fourth Edition,&#13;
(Washington D.C.: International Monetary Fund, 1977, pp. 136-141 and&#13;
Appendix E, pp. 187-194)s&#13;

Differences in Private Direct Fore gnInvestment Definitions&#13;
in Practice&#13;
Although both the OECD and the IMF follow this definition,'the&#13;
data are not fully comparable9 as the synopsis below shows0 The OECD&#13;
figures for a given country are generally higher than those of the IMF;&#13;
actual figures are likely to be even higher because recording of&#13;
transnational corporations' intracompany flows is very incomplete0&#13;
However, the gap between the two sets of figures is mainly explained&#13;
by reinvested earnings which are included in OECD data, but not in&#13;
IMF data.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 5&#13;
Reinvested earnings. The OECD data include reinvw-ted&#13;
earnings which are partially estimated by the Secretariat, while the&#13;
IMF reinvested earnings data are very partial, the basis being&#13;
private investmpnt income statistics collected by the IMF for its&#13;
Balance of Payments Yearbook. Annex I, Table 4, suggests that reinvested&#13;
earnings have accounted for about 40% of the total recorded private&#13;
investment flows to developing countties in recent years.&#13;
Intercompany lending and tax havens. Both sets of data&#13;
include flows to tax-haven countries.   Major transnational corporations&#13;
regularly move funds in and out of tax havens as a form of intra-&#13;
corporation lending.  Transfer pricing at other than arms' length&#13;
market prices facilitates such moves.   Some flows to tax havens are&#13;
recorded, but flows from tax havens to developing countries are often&#13;
not fully recorded. In this paper, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Netherlands&#13;
Antilles and New Hebrides have been regarded as pure tax havens. Other&#13;
tax havens include Hong Kong, Panama, Liechtenstein, Liberia, Costa&#13;
Rica and Luxembourg, but not all the flows to these countries are&#13;
tax-haven flows. All these countries have also attracted flows for&#13;
productive investment, which have therefore been included in the&#13;
investment flows. Flows to pure tax havens played an important role&#13;
in 1974, when they amounted to $2 billion or a quarter of the total&#13;
investment flows to developing countries. The lack of investment&#13;
opportunities during the recession no doubt accounted for the size&#13;
of this flow. It is unlikely that such high levels will continue.&#13;
Investment by sectors. Both the OECD and IMF data include&#13;
investment in all sectors, including, for example, real estate.&#13;
Share of ownership. The IMF data reflect the limits that&#13;
some countries set on their private coverage. For example, Canada limits&#13;
investment records to investment of controlling interests, but the&#13;
United States includes in investment the total investment by residents&#13;
in a controlled enterprise, whether by the controlling interests&#13;
or by other persons. On the other hand, OECD data include cases A&#13;
where an investor owns less than 25% of the voting stock of an associated&#13;
company in developing countries and loans that share in order to&#13;
establish or deepen some working relationship in the technical field,&#13;
in marketing policies, etc; this type of investment could be classified&#13;
in the IMF data as portfolio investment.&#13;
Guarantees by parent companies. The OECD data generally include&#13;
guarantees by parent companies, while the IMF include only some. In&#13;
the IMF data, some developing countries treat guarantees as private&#13;
investment, while others treat them as "errors and omissions" in&#13;
balance of payments statistics. Guarantees by parent companies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 6&#13;
are sometimes made in relation to the imports of goods by their&#13;
foreign subsidiaries from parent countries. However, such guarantees&#13;
do not appear to form a significant proportion of total flows.&#13;
United States Data&#13;
US flow and stock data are the sum of net capital outflows,&#13;
reinvested earnings and some valuation adjustments (Tables 10-15)o&#13;
Special care is needed in evaluating US data: major revisions&#13;
have been made (1) for the years 1973-76, because of changes in the treat-&#13;
ment of transactions involving a particular US-incorporated petroleum com-&#13;
pany, its foreign branch and the foreign host government, and (2)&#13;
for the years 1966-76, because of a change in this US company's&#13;
reporting method. /1&#13;
The first revision relates to certain deposits made by the&#13;
host government with the US company beginning in late 1973. According&#13;
to information provided by the company, these deposits were treated&#13;
as having been made in anticipation of the issuance of capital shares,&#13;
and hence were classified as private investment in the US (net capital&#13;
inflows).  However, in the revised accounts, the host government is&#13;
considered to have made these deposits to purchase the assets of the&#13;
US company's foreign branch, and, therefore, the deposits and subsequent&#13;
related transactlons are included in the data for US private investment&#13;
abroad (net capital outflows)0 Further, changes in what were pre-&#13;
viously considered intercompany liabilities owed to the host government&#13;
by the US company for imputed dividends not paid are now considered&#13;
liabilities of the foreign branch to the host government for the use&#13;
of producing assets and, hence are included in US private direct&#13;
investment abroad (net capital outflows).&#13;
The second revision relates mainly to a change in the US&#13;
company's reporting of liabilities of the branch in the context of the&#13;
balance of payments methodology. Previously, the reporting procedure&#13;
resulted in the reporting of gross branch assets, but this has now&#13;
been changed to reporting on a net basis, i.e. branch assets net of&#13;
branch liabilities. This change reduced the US company's private investment&#13;
by the amount of branch liabilities, and in the absence of other changes,&#13;
an increase (decrease) in branch liabilities lowers (raises) net branch&#13;

assets and results in a private investment inflow (outflow). As a result&#13;
of the laLge increases in oil prices, royalty and tax rates and oil&#13;
production after 1972, branch liabilities subsequently increased&#13;
substantially in the form of increased taxes and royalties due the&#13;
host government. The deduction of branch liabilities from branch&#13;
assets shifted the US private investment position to a negative one&#13;
in the petroleum sector in 1974, with large net direct investment&#13;
inflows to the US. The net effect of all the revisions was a downward&#13;
revision in US investment stock in each of the years 1966-75, especially&#13;
in 1974 and 1975.&#13;
Japanese Data&#13;
Flow data are the total amount of gross private investment&#13;
approved by the Bank of Japan under the Foreign Exchange Control Law.&#13;
Disbursement data by recipient countries, by sectors or stock data&#13;
are not available.&#13;
Developed countries in Table 16 include some developing&#13;
countries in Southern Europe and in Oceania such as Greece, Yugoslavia&#13;
and Papua New Guinea; flow data by selected recipient developing countries&#13;
are available only for 1972-76, as shown in Table 17.&#13;
German Data&#13;
Flow data do not include reinvested earnings. Neither flow&#13;
data by sectors prior to 1971 nor stock data are available. However,&#13;
accumulated net flows from 1952 to 1976, which are in the form of an&#13;
official publication, may be regarded as a proxy for the latest stock&#13;
data. German pre-war property abroad had been confiscated during r&#13;
World War II, after which direct restitution was made only in a few&#13;
countries and only in part. Thus German private investment resumed&#13;
in 1952 from a virtual zero base. No consecutive matrix flow data&#13;
by sectors and recipient countries are available.&#13;
United Kingdom Data&#13;
Flow data are obtained through quarterly inquiries by the&#13;
UK Department of Trade. These data cover a wide range of transactions,&#13;
including equity participation, reinvested earnings and changes in&#13;
branch head office or intercompany indebtedness. All sectors of industry&#13;
except oil companies are approached, including a number of public&#13;
corporations such as the British Steel Corporation. Annual flow data,&#13;
therefore, tend to understate the actual flow by the amount of oil&#13;
investment. A different source provides the following direct investment&#13;
flow and stock in the oil sector for all regions (US$ millions):&#13;

No detailed annual flow data by recipient developing countries are available&#13;

Stock data are book values of net assets and tend to under-&#13;

which are included in the flow data, are excluded from the stock&#13;

years (Table 29), and special care is needed in evaluating this table&#13;

Oil Exorters9 Data&#13;
Direct investment flow from 17 DAC countries to oil'-exporting&#13;
developing countries including OPEC and estimated stock in these&#13;
countries as of the end of 1976 are set out by individual recipient&#13;
countries9 based on DAC data (Table 30). The 1970=76 average amount&#13;
of flows to oil exporters accounts for roughly 10% of the total DAC&#13;
investments to developing countries; the figure for the end-l976 stock&#13;
is around 20%o Private investment flow to Indonesia in 1975 was ex-&#13;
ceptionally large ($13 billion)1, mainly reflecting its restrictions&#13;
on the repatriation of affiliate earnings in the oil sector0&#13;
Data on private investment flow from oil exporting countries&#13;
are virtually unavailable; in fact, IMF balance of payments statistics&#13;

ANNEX II: JAPAN'S POLICY FOR PRIVATE DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT&#13;
Japan's private investment policies consist of: (i) foreign&#13;
exchange control; (ii) monetary and fiscal measures; and (iii) private&#13;
investment insurance. The Japanese government also promotes private&#13;
investment by providing potential investors with information about the&#13;
investment climate abroad through such semiofficial agencies as the&#13;
Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) and by training in managerial&#13;
and technological skills for international business. Since World War II,&#13;
private investment policies have changed with Japan's balance of&#13;
payments situation. There has been a general policy trend from re-&#13;
striction to liberalization. Japan's private investment abroad is&#13;
now free of restraints; indeed, all measures seek to promote it.&#13;
A. Private Direct Foreign Investment Policies&#13;
Foreign Exchange Control&#13;
Japan's first post-war private investment was approved in&#13;
1951. Initially, because of its balance of payments deficits, there&#13;
were strict exchange controls on investment abroad. As the deficits&#13;
faded away and surpluses emerged, controls have been relaxed. In&#13;
October 1969, private investments of US$200,000 or less were placed&#13;
under an automatic approval system by the Bank of Japan. Such invest-&#13;
ments were, however, required to flow to foreign subsidiaries 25% or more&#13;
of whose equity capital was owned by Japanese companies. In September&#13;
1970, the ceiling was raised to $1 million, and in July 1971, when&#13;
Japan's balance of payments surpluses became a growing international&#13;
concern, the ceiling was abolished, while the required rate of equity&#13;
participation by Japanese companies was lowered from 25% to 10%.&#13;
In June 1972 even this restriction was abolished, and private investment&#13;
became free of virtually any restraints, The liberalization applies&#13;
to all sectors except fishing, banking and finance, Special oil and&#13;
non-oil mineral investments, under which Japanese companies provide&#13;
loans to foreign investors who repay in kind in oil or non-oil mineral&#13;
exports, are still subject to approval by the Ministry of International&#13;
Trade and Industry; in practice it is almost automatic.&#13;
Monetary and Fiscal Measures&#13;
Monetary and fiscal measures to promote investment may be&#13;
classified as: (1) government financial aid to private sectors through&#13;
public financial institutions; (2) government aid to private sectors&#13;
through a special system called the "Foreign Currency Loan System";&#13;
and (3) tax incentives.&#13;
&#13;

Financial aid through public financial institutions. The&#13;
government provides Japanese private companies with finanical aid&#13;
for private investment through finance corporations, public corpor-&#13;
ations and semi-public corporations. The most important are: the&#13;
Export-Import Bank of Japan (EXIM), the Overseas Economic Cooperation&#13;
Fund (OECF), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the&#13;
Japan Overseas Development Corporation (JODC), the Japan Petroleum&#13;
Development Corporation (JPDC) and the Metal Mining Agency of Japan&#13;
(MMAJ). Private investors can thus obtain subsidies from the government&#13;
through low interest rates and long-term maturities on loans. Reflecting&#13;
the paucity of Japan's natural resources and its close relationships&#13;
with developing countries, especially in Southeast Asia, financial&#13;
aid aims to promote private investment in natural resources exploration&#13;
and development and to contribute to the developing countries' in-&#13;
dustrialization. The EXIM is by far the most important institution;&#13;
its commitments are varied in terms of sectors and proj;ct sizes. The&#13;
OECF and JICA are only involved in developing country projects,&#13;
while the JODC is intended to assist small and medium-sized Japanese&#13;
companies. The JPDC and MMAJ provide assistance for investment in&#13;
natural resources.&#13;
Export-Import Bank of Japan (EXIM). The EXIM was established&#13;
in December 1950 to promote Japan's exports through medium- and long-&#13;
term financing. Since the mid-1950's, the scope of its operations has&#13;
been gradually expanded to include import financing, foreign investment&#13;
financing (August 1955) and direct loans to foreign governments. In&#13;
recent years, foreign investment financing accounted for roughly 10-15%&#13;
of total loan commitments and was the most important component of&#13;
government aid to private investment abroad.&#13;
Any type of private investment is eligible for EXIM funds.&#13;
The bank does not discriminate among sectors or countries. The bank&#13;
usually provides loans in cooperation with other public corporations&#13;
or commercial banks; its contributions do not exceed 70% of total&#13;
required project funds.&#13;
The period of investment loans cannot exceed 10 years, and&#13;
interest rates have to be between a minimum of 6% per annum and a maximum&#13;
of 9% per annum. In practice, the period of loans is usually 5-7&#13;
years, with interest rates around 7 3/4% per annum. Interest rates of&#13;
cQurse vary depending on the maturities of loans and general trends&#13;
in domestic long-term interest rates.&#13;
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF). The OECF was&#13;
established in March 1961 specifically to contribute to industrial&#13;
development and economic stabilization in developing countries. Originally,&#13;
the EXIM gave aid to developing countries in the form of export credits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56-&#13;
ANNEX II&#13;
Page   3&#13;
The need for direct contributions on more concessional terms led to&#13;
establishment of the OECF as a new entity distinct from the EXIM. While&#13;
the OECF mainly provides loans to developing countries' governments;&#13;
it also provides long-term loans to Japanese private companies for&#13;
development projects abroad.&#13;
Any investment in developing countries is eligible for the&#13;
OECF funds when it is difficult to obtain such funds from the EXIM or&#13;
commercial banks. This restriction is intended to avoid excessive&#13;
reliance by Japanese companies on the soft OECF loans. Financing is&#13;
also available for preinvestment feasibility studies.&#13;
The period of loans cannot exceed 20 years, and interEst&#13;
rates have to be 3.5% per annum or higher. In practice, the period of&#13;
loans is usually around 10 years; interest rates are around 6%&#13;
per annum. These terms are clearly "softer" then those of the EXIM.&#13;
Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The JICA was&#13;
established in August 1974 by merging the Japan Emigration Service and&#13;
Japan Technological Cooperation Agency to provide funds which contribute&#13;
to social development, agricultural and forestry development, and mining&#13;
and manufacturing development in developing countries. This agency&#13;
is a complementary body, operating in collaboration with the OECF to&#13;
promote Japan's relationships with developing countries.    JICA funds&#13;
are available for the following types.of investment when it is difficult&#13;
to obtain such funds from either the EXIM or the OECF:                   a&#13;
I&#13;
(a) investment in infrastructure related to a development&#13;
project or in complementary facilities which are necessarr&#13;
for such a project,&#13;
(b) investment in experimental development projects other&#13;
than pertroleum, natural gas and minerals, when the&#13;
project is deemed difficult unless carried out in com-&#13;
bination with technological improvement or development.&#13;
Loans are of 20 years or less duration, with a grace period of&#13;
5 years or less.  Interest rates are 2% per annum or higher for loans&#13;
relating to infrastructure and 2.5% per annum or higher for an experimental&#13;
project.&#13;
Japan Overseas Development Corporation (JODC). The JODC was&#13;
established in February 1970 as a semi-public corporation to contribute&#13;
to industrial development in developing countries and to an expansion&#13;
of Japan's trade with them. This corporation assists small- and medium-&#13;
sized companies which are required by developing countries' governments&#13;
or their public corporations to participate in joint projects. JODC&#13;
funds are available for capital subscription to joint ventures in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

developing countries under the following conditions:&#13;
(a) such funds are expected to flow to developing countries&#13;
which have received a relatively small amount of Japanese&#13;
investment;&#13;
(b) Japanese companies' equity participation ratios in the&#13;
joint ventures are expected to drop in future to 50%&#13;
or less when majority ownership is allowed, or to the&#13;
maximum permissible percentage when it is not allowed.&#13;
There are two different upper limits on loans, depending&#13;
on the Japanese companies' participation ratios:   in the case of&#13;
majority participation, two-thirds or less of the amount of sub-&#13;
scription; in the case of minority participation, one-half or less.&#13;
Loans are of 20 years or less duration, including a grace&#13;
period of 7 years or less. Interest is not levied, but there is an&#13;
administrative charge of 0.75% per annum on outstanding loans.&#13;
Japan Petroleum Development Corporation (JPDC). The JPDC was&#13;
established in October 1967 to provide funds for petroleum and natural&#13;
gas exploration. The brief Arab-Israeli war of that year marked the&#13;
beginning of the seller's market in energy, and the Japanese government&#13;
wanted to ensure uninterrupted and stable supplies of petroleum.&#13;
The JPDC funds are available for investment in exploration,&#13;
extraction and processing of petroleum including oil sands and oil&#13;
shales.&#13;
Loans are of 18 years duration or less, while interest rates&#13;
are 6.75% per annum or higher.&#13;
Metal Mining Agency of Japan (MMAJ). The MMAJ was established&#13;
in May 1963 to provide funds for exploration of metallic minerals. Its&#13;
establishment coincided with Japan's take-off in industrialization, whicKf&#13;
focused on heavy industries that needed stable and cheap supplies of&#13;
metal ores. The scope of business was originally limited to loans&#13;
for domestic eXploration, but it was expanded to foreign exploration in&#13;
1968.&#13;
MMAJ funds are available for exploration in eight metallic&#13;
minerals: copper, lead, zinc, manganese ore, nickel ore, bauxite,&#13;
chrome ore and uranium ore.&#13;
The period of loans in 10-18 years, while interest rates&#13;
are 6.75% per annum.&#13;

"Foreign Currency Loan System". This system was establish2!&#13;
in September 1972. In that year, despite the 1971 yen revaluation,&#13;
Japan's balance of payments surpluses were not decreasing, and additional&#13;
policies to decrease them were required. Under this system, the government&#13;
provides funds in foreign currencies (mostly US dollars) for private investment&#13;
to Japanese investors through authorized foreign exchange banks and&#13;
four of the six public corporations discussed above (EXIM, OECF, JPDC and&#13;
bDAJ). These institutions can lend individually or in cooperation with&#13;
other authorized institutions both in yen and in foreign currencies.&#13;
The system is intended to reduce foreign exchange risks which investors&#13;
would otherwise have to bear themselves and1, hence1, promotes private&#13;
investment in periods of exchange rate fluctuations. The financial&#13;
institutions obtain loanable funds in foreign currencies by selling yen&#13;
on the Tokyo foreign exchange market1, thus shifting foreign exchange&#13;
risks from investors to these institutions.&#13;
The qualified financial institutions and types of investment&#13;
eligible for their funds may be summarized as follows:&#13;
Authorized foreign exchange banks 0   0 . investment in general&#13;
EXIM   . 0   0 0   0  0  0 0    0 0   0 0 investment in "imipor-&#13;
tant commodities'1l&#13;
OECF   .  0  0 0   0  0   0 0   0 0   0 . investment not covered&#13;
by the EXIM&#13;
JPDC   0  0  0  0  0 0    0  0  0  0 0     investment in petroleum&#13;
exploration&#13;
MMhJ   0  0  0   0  0 0   0 0   0 0   0  0 investment in metallic&#13;
minerals exploration&#13;
Private investors cannot obtain all the investment funds they&#13;
require in foreign currencies; they are expected to bear at least a&#13;
part of the exchange risks0 Originally, 70% of the funds needed were&#13;
available in foreign currencies; in May 1973 this ratio was raised to 90%&#13;
to promote private investment more rapidly0 In January 19741, it was&#13;
reduced to 50% to conserve foreign exchange reserves to finance oil&#13;
Imports after the 1973 oil price increase0&#13;
The terms and conditions may vary from one financial institution&#13;
to another0 The authorized foreign exchange banks can decide on the period&#13;
of loans and interest rates through negotiations with investors0 They&#13;
11  The "important commodities" are not specified, but the EXIM loan&#13;
commitments in recent years suggest that they are petroleum, natural&#13;
gas1 coal, uranium ore, copper, iron ore and bauxite0&#13;

tend to charge somewhat higher interest than the Euirodollar rate,&#13;
reflecting their heavy reliance on Eurodollar borrowing. The four&#13;
public corporations are required to lend on the basis of the terms and&#13;
conditions described above.&#13;
Tax Incentives. Japan's tax incentives involve the treatment&#13;
of income derived from foreign sources--tax credit--and the preferential&#13;
treatment of specified investments for a limited period--tax deferral.&#13;
Tax Credit. The essence of the tax credit established in 1962&#13;
is that Japanese companies which obtain income from foreign sources,&#13;
such as dividends from their foreign affiliates, can claim that a&#13;
certain amount of the tax calculated on the basis of the following&#13;
formula be deducted from their corporate tax to be paid to the Japanese&#13;
government:&#13;
T = Ax   B&#13;
C-A&#13;
where: T = Deductible amount from Japan's corporate tax&#13;
A = Foreign corporate tax which the affiliates pay to&#13;
foreign governments&#13;
B = Income from foreign sources which the Japanese&#13;
parent companies receive&#13;
C = Foreign income of the affiliates.&#13;
To be eligible for the tax credit, the Japanese parent companies&#13;
have to hold 25% or more of the equity capital of the affiliates for&#13;
more than six months before their claim; such affiliates exclude "paper"&#13;
companies set up in tax havens for tax advantages.&#13;
Tax Deferral    This system was established in March 1969&#13;
to promote private investment in developing countries. Under this system,&#13;
Japanese companies can transfer a certain amount to a loss reserve&#13;
and deduct this amount as expenses from taxable income. The amount&#13;
credited may be reserved for five years and then transferred back to&#13;
taxable income in equal installments during the subsequent five years.&#13;
The transferable amounts as percentage of investment vary, depending on&#13;
the types of investment and sectors, as summarized below. Investment&#13;
in natural resources--petroleum, natural gas, metallic minerals, coal,&#13;
fluorite and timber--is given preferential treatment.&#13;

Investments in developed countries other than in natural resources&#13;
became ineligible in April 1975. On the other hand, the percentages&#13;
of the amount transferable were raised in April 19730 for natural&#13;
resources development, from 30% to 40%; for 'others"" from 10% to 30%.&#13;
Investment Insurance System&#13;
The Japanese government established an investment insurance&#13;
system in 1956-57, at which time only the US had such a system,&#13;
Originally, there were two different schemes-Foreign Investment Principal&#13;
Insurance and Foreign Investment Incobae Insurance--but investors were&#13;
not satisfied because the types of investment and risks insured were&#13;
limited and coverage in case of loss was too low0    Therefore, in may&#13;
1970 the government merged these schemes into one--Foreign Investment&#13;
Insurance--and extended the scope of applicationo After further ex-&#13;
tensions of application in 1971-1975 , the scheme became one of the&#13;
most comprehensive among developed countries. The present scheme,&#13;
administered by the Ministry of InternatiDnal Trade and Inidustry, is&#13;
summarized as follows.&#13;
Types of investment covered. Any of the following types of invest-&#13;
ments worldwide are eligible for the scheme0 Investments must be new--&#13;
new projects or new expansion programs--and must contribute to the promotion&#13;
of Japan's international economic relations:&#13;
- subscription to the equity capital&#13;
- long-term loans (five years or more) to the partner of a&#13;
joint venture or management-controlled companies abroad&#13;
- investment in real estate for business operations&#13;
- loans for development and production of 20 designated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX II&#13;
Page   8&#13;
mineral resources /1 and other primary conmodities, /2&#13;
provided that these are to be imported to Japan under long-&#13;
term supply contracts.&#13;
Types of risks insured. For six months or more, the scheme&#13;
covers three categories of political risks--war, expropriation and bans&#13;
on transfers of investient income--and a non-political risk called a&#13;
"credit risk," such as bankruptcy or default of the borrower. This credit&#13;
risk applies to natural resources-related investment only, described&#13;
above.&#13;
Coverage of loss. The extent of coverage is a certain percentage&#13;
of the original investment amount or the estimated amount at the time&#13;
of the loss, whichever is smaller, depending on the types of risks,&#13;
as follows:&#13;
In case of the three political risks   .    .   . up to 90%&#13;
In case of the credit risk     .   .   .   .    . up to 80%&#13;
Premium rates. The annual premium rate is 0.7% of current&#13;
amounts for the four risks together.&#13;
Duration of coverage. The maximum period of coverage is&#13;
15 years. In exceptional cases, where the period between the investment&#13;
and start of operations is deemed especially long--two years or more,&#13;
this period may be added to the covered period.&#13;
B. Effects of Private Investment Policies&#13;
It is difficult to quantify the extent to which these policies&#13;
have promoted Japan's private investment abroad. Recent developments&#13;
by major sectors and regions (Table AII.1) suggest that the policies,&#13;
especially the full liberalization of foreign exchange control and the&#13;
creation of the "Foreign Currency Loan System," contributed to the sharp,&#13;
increase in investments approved in FY1972-73. Private investment in&#13;
manufacturing has clearly increased since then--it accounted for 33%&#13;
of investments in FY1972-77, compared to 25% in FY1967-71, while investment&#13;
in mining was 25% for both periods. Investment in developing countries,&#13;
1/  Copper, lead, zinc, chrome, manganese, tungsten, molybdenite, nickel,&#13;
bauxite, vanadium, niobium, coal, petroleum, natural gas, antimony,&#13;
iron ore, iron sand, uranium ore, fluorite and rock salt.&#13;
2/ Including natural rubber, timber, wool, cotton, silk, corn and sugar.&#13;

especially in Asia, grew. More than half the total investment in FY1972-77&#13;
went to these countries, contrasting with just over 40% in the preceding&#13;
five years.&#13;
The financing of Japan's private investment is shown in&#13;
Table AII.2, which presents the loan commitments of the six public&#13;
financial institutions. The combined total of commitments in 1973&#13;
was more than double the 1972 level, amounting to $763 million, and&#13;
has roughly been maintained at the $600-700 million level since. At&#13;
this level, it accounts for around 20% of the private investment in&#13;
these years. The EXIM and OECF have played important roles; so has the&#13;
JPDC, which has specifically financed oil exploration and development.&#13;

abroad, as did the booming domestic economy, the growth of firms, the&#13;
need to assure sources of raw materials and the revaluation of the yen.&#13;
It is impossible to estimate how much of the support was redundant. If&#13;
approvals are a guide, Japan's private investment has stagnated since&#13;
FY1974. This is almost certainly largely the result of Japanese&#13;
corporations' reluctance to invest, although problems in the incentive&#13;
system have also contributed. Thus, while the "Foreign Currency Loan&#13;
System" has mitigated the foreign exchange risks for private companies,&#13;
it has burdened financial institutions with those risks. This shift&#13;
in risk has apparently led them to be reluctant to lend in dollars&#13;
during the period of the dollar depreciation against the yen. The&#13;
JODC's upper limit of loans--in the case of minority participation,&#13;
one-half of the amount of subscription--may be too low for small- and&#13;
medium-sized companies.&#13;
Uncertainties about the future course of the Japanese economy,&#13;
however, appear to be of greater importance. Japanese companies have&#13;
come to believe that Japan's high growth period, with an annual rate of&#13;
10% in real GNP, has ended, but there is no consensus yet about medium-&#13;
term growth rates and the implications of reduced growth for corporate&#13;
management. Consequently, these companies have become more cautious&#13;
than in the high-growth period in planning expansion of their business&#13;
abroad. They claim that joint ventures operate below capacity for&#13;
many years and do not yield profits. The recent favorable economic&#13;
conditions for Japanese companies, such as the marked acceleration of&#13;
appreciation of the yen against the US dollar and monetary ease, have&#13;
had only small positive effects on reviving the momentum for investment&#13;
abroad. The recent level of $3 billion is likely to continue for a&#13;
few years. However, some government surveys suggest that Japanese&#13;
manufacturing industries have a strong investment potential, and private&#13;
investment is expected to increase again fairly rapidly in the 1980's.&#13;
Investment in developing countries is likely to center on natural re-&#13;
sources-related investments including oil refineries and petrochemicals,&#13;
and on iron and steel.&#13;

            The paper discusses the changing
            characteristics of private direct foreign investment in
            developing countries in relation to home and host country
            policies. An overall view of the geographical and sectoral
            characteristics of private direct foreign investment flows
            to developing countries introduces the paper. The response
            of the transnational corporations to the changing
            environment in developing countries is then discussed. The
            mainbody of the paper is concerned with policy issues for
            the developing countries that wish to attract private direct
            foreign investment and for the industrialized countries that
            are the principal source of such flows. The authors conclude
            that overall macroeconomic and sectoral policies are of
            overwhelming policy importance, but also explore incentive
            policies and some institutional issues. A discussion of the
            role of international institutions in the private investment
            environment concludes the paper.
