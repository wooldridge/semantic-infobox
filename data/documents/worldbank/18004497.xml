&#13;
OLIVER: July 20, 1986. This is Robert Oliver about to have a happy conversation with&#13;
Bernadette Schmitt in New York City. I wonder if we could begin by your telling a bit&#13;
about your background and how you got to know Mr. [George D.] Woods; eventually Iâ&#128;&#153;ll&#13;
ask you about how you came to the World Bank. Where were you born?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: In Grand Rapids, Michigan. I grew up in a family of nine children and&#13;
went through high school and one year of college and then got a job. It was in the midst&#13;
of the Depression, and I went to work for a candy companyâ&#128;&#148;Chici [phonetic] Candiesâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
and worked as secretary and all-around clerk. It was a rather small office. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s where I&#13;
got most of my experience. Some friends of mine were going to Texas for a while, and I&#13;
went down with them and got a job there with the Department of Labor Statistics.&#13;
Eventually I was transferred to the Philadelphia office. They had an office in&#13;
Philadelphia, and while I was living in Philadelphia, I took a civil service examination.&#13;
Later on, I was working for the Navy Department in Philadelphia for Captain Hoots&#13;
[phonetic] who was the Supervisory Cost Inspector in an office there. I worked there for&#13;
a couple of years, and at the end of 1942 I thought maybe Iâ&#128;&#153;d go back to Michigan.&#13;
&#13;
Meanwhile Iâ&#128;&#153;d met other friends in Philadelphia and worked with them. They were all&#13;
moving down to Washington. The war was hot. It was after Pearl Harbor, and they said&#13;
to come on down. They had lined up a job for me there in the Pentagon. And I worked&#13;
forâ&#128;&#148;I guess he was a Major at the timeâ&#128;&#148;Major Tritopo [phonetic]. And then he was&#13;
transferred to Washington, D.C., across the river from the Pentagon, and I decided Iâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
rather take my chances and be reassigned in the Pentagon. And thatâ&#128;&#153;s how I landed with&#13;
Mr. Woods. Eileen Shoemaker, who worked for Frank Denton who had recruited Mr.&#13;
Woods to the Pentagon, was the chief clerk in our divisionâ&#128;&#148;the Production Divisionâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
which was in the Army Service Forces under General [Brehon B.] Somervell.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Woods had needed a secretary. I guess his last secretary had resigned, and so she&#13;
thought he and I would match up in personality and temperament. Anyway I started&#13;
working for George Woods then.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: This is the Mr. George Woods that you continued to work with after the war&#13;
and through the years in the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes. George D. Woods. He was a major in the Army at the time, and&#13;
before the end of the war he became Colonel Woods. As he always said, â&#128;&#149;A civilian in&#13;
uniform.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You have mentioned the name Frank Denton. Would you say a word about&#13;
him and his relation with Mr. Woods and what you can about how Mr. Woods happened&#13;
to be recruited into that particular unit?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Oh, I donâ&#128;&#153;t know, except that it was the Production Division and they had a&#13;
lot to do with liaison with the War Production Board and getting materiel out to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Bernadette Schmitt&#13;
                            July 20, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            2&#13;
armed forces. There was a lot of coordination there. They were both bankers. Frank&#13;
Denton was the son of a commercial banker in Arkansas, Kansas, and came to&#13;
Washington or maybe to Pittsburgh first. But he used to be an auditor for the Treasury&#13;
Department. He ended up in the Mellon Securities Corporation or helped to found it&#13;
along with R. K. Mellon. Yes, I believe it was R. K. He was in that position, the head of&#13;
Mellon Securities Corporation, at the time of the war and went down to get the war over&#13;
with and do his bit. And then he was down there only a couple of months. I think he&#13;
went down in early 1942, and by the end of that year he had recruited Mr. Woods from&#13;
New York. He said, â&#128;&#149;Come on, George, weâ&#128;&#153;ve got to get this war over with.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I take it they had known each other.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: They were very good friendsâ&#128;&#148;Betty and Frank and George and Louise. So&#13;
they all moved down to Washington and spent those years there. The Dentons had two&#13;
sons. And they kept their home in Pittsburgh. And anyway Frank Denton was a colonel&#13;
when I went down there, and then he eventually ended up as a brigadier general before&#13;
the war was over. They both were anxious to have the war ended and get home, back to&#13;
their respective positions and their respective cities.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, how about you? First of all, before I ask you what you decided to do&#13;
after the war, are there any incidentsâ&#128;&#148;anecdotes so to speakâ&#128;&#148;about this period which&#13;
come to your mind? About personalities or about the kind of work that was being done.&#13;
Did you work late hours?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Oh, yes, we worked six days a week. Usually until seven oâ&#128;&#153;clock because&#13;
there was a line of command, and weâ&#128;&#153;d have to wait for General Somervell to go home,&#13;
and Howard Bruce. He was a civilian in the Pentagon. I think he was the next in&#13;
command. I think Somervell was head of Army Service Forces, and then it was Mr.&#13;
Bruce and thenâ&#128;&#148;who was the next one?â&#128;&#148;Lucius Clay. Lucius D. Clay. He was a&#13;
general. And as it got down to the next level, there was a General [H.C.] Minton. He&#13;
was head of the Production Division, and I guess his assistant head of the department was&#13;
Frank Denton. And then George was next in line under Denton.&#13;
&#13;
After I got assigned to George Woods, we worked in adjoining offices. Dentonâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
secretary, then Glenmar Blaughâ&#128;&#148;very nice gal, quite a character, wanted to go in the&#13;
OSS [Office of Strategic Services], the predecessor of the CIA [Central Intelligence&#13;
Agency]. She was going to go overseas, so he needed a new secretary. He told George&#13;
he wanted me to work for him. That was the way that started. I went to work for him&#13;
and finished the war there with Colonel Denton, then General Denton.&#13;
&#13;
When the war was over, we all headed home. They both had asked me to go to work for&#13;
them after the war, and I thought New York was more fascinating than Pittsburgh.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Quite right.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: But anyway, at the end of the war Mr. Denton went back to Pittsburgh, and&#13;
Mr. Woods came back to New York. And by that time I decided I would come up to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Bernadette Schmitt&#13;
                            July 20, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           3&#13;
New York to work in First Boston, and there was no problem about that. He paved the way,&#13;
and I was taken on. And then soon after that in 1945â&#128;&#148;that was October 1945â&#128;&#148;he and&#13;
Denton both left Washington almost immediately after the war. They both checked out&#13;
of the Army as quickly as they could because they wanted to get on with their lives and&#13;
settle again in their previous positions.&#13;
&#13;
And then because of some conversations theyâ&#128;&#153;d had during the last year or so they were&#13;
in Washingtonâ&#128;&#148;the war was winding down and First Boston and Mellon Securities&#13;
decided to merge. And I guess R. K. Mellon wanted Frank Denton to come on with the&#13;
bankâ&#128;&#148;the Mellon Bankâ&#128;&#148;and give up the Mellon Securities, so Mellon Securities&#13;
merged with First Boston. And then they brought a lot of commercial activity into First&#13;
Boston. But that was in 1946. And then for a while we moved over to 2 Wall Street. We&#13;
had been at 100 Broadway when I first started in 1945. And then Mr. Woods and a big&#13;
segment of the Buying Department went over and took the Mellon Securities offices&#13;
which were in 2 Wall Street at the time.&#13;
&#13;
And we had a door put through from one building to the next so that people could walk&#13;
through without going down to the street, because they were two separate buildings. We&#13;
stayed there for about a year and then moved back to 100 Broadway, and I guess we&#13;
found more space in the building, or whatever, and we found enough space to absorb&#13;
everybody. And so we gave up the Mellon Securities offices.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: When you say â&#128;&#149;we,â&#128;&#150; I take it you were by this time working for Mr. Woods&#13;
in New York.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did you start . . .&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: He came as a Vice President, and I guess youâ&#128;&#153;d have to refer to the annual&#13;
reports. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure just which year it was he became Senior Vice President or&#13;
Executive Vice President, whichever it was, and then by 1949 he was made Chairman of&#13;
the Executive Committee. In 1951 when Mr. [Harry M.] Addinsell stepped down as&#13;
Chairman, he became Chairman of the Board. And I should say Colonel [Allan M.] Pope&#13;
had been President when we first came back in 1945. And then somewhere in those&#13;
years he had stepped down, and Mr. [James] Coggeshall became President. And then Mr.&#13;
Woods, following in 1951, became Chairman after Mr. Addinsell left.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s Chairman of the Board?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Chairman of the Board of First Boston Corporation.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Was he also Chief Executive Officer, or did that title even exist in those&#13;
days?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Bernadette Schmitt&#13;
                              July 20, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              4&#13;
SCHMITT: As I recollect, it didnâ&#128;&#153;t exist formally in those days. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been aware of the&#13;
CEO, Chief Executive Officer, designation of title as such only in the past 10 to 15 years,&#13;
if that long, but it may have existed in an informal way. I may be wrong on all this.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: May I infer that the fact that Frank Denton and George Woods worked&#13;
closely with each other during the war may have had some effect on increasing the&#13;
probability of the merger between Mellon Securities and First Boston? Did Mr. Woods&#13;
have a major hand in that merger?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes, I think so. They had their problems. R. K. Mellon had changes that&#13;
he wanted to make in the Mellon Bank. He wanted Frank Denton to be there beside him.&#13;
I think Frank Denton was always Vice Chairman of Mellon Bank from that time on, and&#13;
R. K. was always the Chairman. I think he just wanted to have Frank Denton working&#13;
more closely with him in the bank, and the Securities went to First Boston. That seemed&#13;
to be a good merger.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Iâ&#128;&#153;m not totally clear about the relation between Mellon Bank and Mellon&#13;
Securities. Was Mellon Securities a part of the Mellon Bank during or before the war,&#13;
with offices in New York?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: I guess so. No, well, they had a branch in New York, but their main offices&#13;
were in Pittsburgh. And I donâ&#128;&#153;t know too much of the previous background of Mellon&#13;
Securities. You know, there was the banking law back in 1933. Was it 1933? And I&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t know how that fits in, whether Mellon Securities was a separate, completely&#13;
separate entity. It must have been. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whether there was some legal reason for&#13;
them to close that office.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Frank Dentonâ&#128;&#153;s no longer around. He died the same year Mr. Woods did,&#13;
as a matter of fact.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, let us move forward closer to the Woods years in the World Bank.&#13;
What can you say about Woodsâ&#128;&#153; work for the World Bank as a consultant and visits to&#13;
India and that sort of thing in the fifties?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Well, only that he and Mr. Eugene Black had been good friends. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not&#13;
sure whether Blackâ&#128;&#148;was he with Harris-Forbes, or Chase-Harris-Forbes?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It is my understanding that he worked in the Atlantic office of Harris Forbes&#13;
at one point in the late twenties.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Harris Forbes. Is that what it was? It was before I joined First Boston, so I&#13;
was a bit hazy on just how he fitted into the Harris-Forbes/Chase-Harris-Forbes/First&#13;
Boston picture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bernadette Schmitt&#13;
                             July 20, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              5&#13;
OLIVER: It is my impression that Mr. Black and Mr. Woods did know each other in the&#13;
late twenties, but how well they knew each other and whether they were close friends or&#13;
not, I just donâ&#128;&#153;t know. And I take it you donâ&#128;&#153;t either.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: I donâ&#128;&#153;t really know, except I know they were friends and the Black name&#13;
wasâ&#128;&#148;well, by 1949 he was with the World Bank, and I guess the relationship did go&#13;
back to the late twenties.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: In any event, First Boston together with Morgan Stanley was a major&#13;
underwriter for World Bank bonds from the very beginning. So it would have been a&#13;
very natural thing for Mr. Black, first as Executive Director of the Bank and then as&#13;
President of the Bank, to be in close touch with a major officer of one of the major&#13;
underwriting firms.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes. And by reason of being underwriters and bankers in an important&#13;
way, Mr. Woods was invited to the Annual Meetings of the World Bank, and got&#13;
acquainted with a lot of the financial people, and then he was sent on two or three&#13;
missions during the fifties by Mr. Black. He went over to help settle the Suez Canal&#13;
matter, and he set upâ&#128;&#148;or helped to establish or developâ&#128;&#148;the steel industry in India. And&#13;
...&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Do you happen to know whether or not he ever went to India solely for First&#13;
Boston, wholly apart from being on missions for the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: I donâ&#128;&#153;t think so. No, I donâ&#128;&#153;t recollect that he went on First Boston business&#13;
specifically, but that goes pretty far back, and my memory may be hazy on that. I think&#13;
his first major trips to India were on World Bank business in maybe 1952. He was&#13;
recruited to go to India and talk to the Tatas, the Tata Steel and India Steelâ&#128;&#148;excuse me,&#13;
the ICICI [Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India] in India.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: What can you say about Mr. Woods becoming President of the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Well . . .&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: What can you say about those events?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Well, I guess it didnâ&#128;&#153;t surprise anybody really when Mr. Black stepped&#13;
down to have himâ&#128;&#148;I expect he put Mr. Woodsâ&#128;&#153; name in nomination for the job. And&#13;
just the prior year his name had been put forward for the Agency for International&#13;
Development. And that had moved along to a certain point, and then was sort of a red&#13;
herring that was thrown out. And then the newspapers picked up the Dixon-Yates matter,&#13;
and things got kind of hot. Mr. Woods wasnâ&#128;&#153;t embarrassed about Dixon-Yates because&#13;
there was nothing to that. There was, you know, no indictments or anything. It was just&#13;
a lot of fuss about nothing, but it was reported in the papers and in connection with the&#13;
AID job it . . . There were too many anti-Woods things in the papers, and it was all&#13;
political, but still he finally sent a message to the President, Mr. [John F.] Kennedy, and&#13;
said he wanted to withdraw his name.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bernadette Schmitt&#13;
                             July 20, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              6&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, so Mr. Woods accepted the job of President of the World Bank, and&#13;
you came with him down to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes. Mr. Blackâ&#128;&#153;s two secretaries stayed on. Mr. Black talked to Mr.&#13;
Woods about that and Marie Linahan and Connie Ladue both stayed on. He had done&#13;
some traveling with George Wishart and asked George Wishart to stay on, or come on&#13;
with him as his personal assistant. The [International Monetary] Fund had that system of&#13;
personal assistant to the head of the Fund and also the World Bank, so Mr. Wishart&#13;
served for several years in that position. And he wanted to pick up his life in Europe, and&#13;
so he was transferred to the Paris Office. Then he was succeeded by Rainer Steckhan.&#13;
He was with Mr. Woods, and I think stayed on for a while with Mr. [Robert S.]&#13;
McNamara as his personal assistant.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Can you say anything about the relation between Mr. Woods and Mr. Black&#13;
after Mr. Woods became President?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: I think it was very good. Mr. Woods was a firm believer in consulting with&#13;
somebody such as Mr. Black or anybody who would be able to help him in his job in the&#13;
World Bank. Certainly Mr. Black had more background in the Bank than anyone he&#13;
knew in the recent history, and so he consulted with him frequently. As far as I know, he&#13;
telephoned or met with him either in New York or Washington. Mr. Black was a regular&#13;
in Washington. And I think they had a very good relationship.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Mr. Black became sort of an adviser on overseas development issues to&#13;
President [Lyndon B.] Johnson. This would have been 1965, 1966, that kind of period?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes, but right from the start Mr. Woodsâ&#128;&#148;in my recollection he would&#13;
consult regularly with Mr. Black because of his background.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sure. And Mr. Black had consulted with Mr. Woods a fair amount during the&#13;
time that Mr. Black was President.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Probably insofar as he was the banker. I mean one of the bankers. First&#13;
Boston, that is, and Morgan Stanley. There was a lot of consulting and business back and&#13;
forth with the Bank and these two investment banking firms. So they consulted&#13;
frequently on financial matters.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Some people have said that Mr. Black became annoyed when Mr. Woods&#13;
decided to change the firm that did the travel services for the Bank away from American&#13;
Express and to Thomas Cook. Were you aware of that?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: We didnâ&#128;&#153;t go to Thomas Cook.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Oh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bernadette Schmitt&#13;
                             July 20, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                7&#13;
SCHMITT: No, we set up our ownâ&#128;&#148;they might have Thomas Cook now, and I think they&#13;
went back to American Express. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure what happened after that, but I think the&#13;
Monetary Fund had Thomas Cook, if I remember correctly. But, now, Mr. Woods&#13;
wanted to set up the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s own travel section. And it worked quite well for a long time,&#13;
and then I guess after Mr. Woods left and the Bank was expanding very, very rapidly.&#13;
Mr. [William C.] Hauenstein and some other people had been in that division and had&#13;
built up this department. They had their own travel people, and I suppose they went&#13;
outside to American Express at times. Anybody on a trip could consult with American&#13;
Express or other travel agencies while on the trip. But basically all the travel was&#13;
handled in the Washington office of the World Bank. And then, you know, we didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
have the worldwide facilities that an American Express or Thomas Cook would have so .&#13;
. . I may be wrong on a lot of this, too.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Iâ&#128;&#153;m just asking you for your recollections, in any event.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Mr. Woods had gotten sort of disenchanted with American Express a&#13;
couple of times when he was traveling and before he went to the World Bank, and I guess&#13;
he felt theyâ&#128;&#153;d sort of failed him. And so he thought it was worth a try to set up our own&#13;
travel agency. One of the things he did at one point was to, when the World Bank was in&#13;
trouble financially for a while, cut down on first-class travel, which was sort of an&#13;
accepted thing in the World Bank, I believe. But I know when I went out to Japan I&#13;
traveled first class, and it was part of the whole operation.&#13;
&#13;
And then I think it was after thatâ&#128;&#148;that was 1964â&#128;&#148;that the World Bank ran into some&#13;
rough times with the IDA [International Development Association]. Replenishment and&#13;
so forth.&#13;
&#13;
Thereâ&#128;&#153;s always been a rivalry between the Fund and the World Bankâ&#128;&#148;not at the top side,&#13;
but personnel. And theyâ&#128;&#153;d compare notes. And the Fund does this, and the Bank does&#13;
this. There were a lot of little jealousies about things such as traveling first class, which&#13;
the Fund was allowed to do and the World Bank all of a sudden was not allowed toâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
except I guess top officials who would have to be ready for a meeting almost the minute&#13;
they got to their destination. And I think they were still permitted to travel first class.&#13;
But they had a lot of travel arrangements where if they went right on through, I think they&#13;
could travel first class, but if they went second class or economy, then they could break&#13;
the trip half way and go on. So it really was fair, but, you know, it was hard to get&#13;
moneyâ&#128;&#148;they were trying to get money from the U.S. Government. And itâ&#128;&#153;s hard for a&#13;
U.S. congressman traveling economy to run into somebody from the World Bank sitting&#13;
in first class when the World Bank was trying to get funds.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And in those days the World Bank was more dependent upon new funds for&#13;
the IDA replenishment from the United States Government than the Fund was because&#13;
the Fund was not increasing its quotas at the time.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes, exactly.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                              8&#13;
OLIVER: Yes, I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s a very significant point. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve also had the impression that Mr.&#13;
Woods was mildly cross, at least when Mr. Black asked Mr. [Nathaniel] McKitterick to&#13;
go on a mission to Asia with him at a time when McKitterick was supposed to have been&#13;
a major speech writer as a consultant to Mr. Woods. Were you aware of any of that?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Run that one past me again, because obviously I havenâ&#128;&#153;t heard this one.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Mr. McKitterick was a consultant to Mr. Woods.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: As a speech writer.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: And Mr. Black . . .&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And Mr. Black was asked by the Johnson Administration to do a major tour&#13;
of Asia, and Mr. Black asked Mr. McKitterick to go with him on . . .&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Without consulting with Mr. Woods or . . .&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, apparently there was some discussion between Mr. Black and Mr.&#13;
Woods about releasing McKitterick to do this work, but it is my impression that while&#13;
McKitterick was allowed to go, so to speak, it upset Mr. Woods that this happened.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Oh.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It just doesnâ&#128;&#153;t ring any bell with you at all?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Not really, because this was behind the scenes. Mr. Woods did an awful lot&#13;
of work in person. Person-to-person meetings and on the telephone. I know they had a&#13;
lot of listening devices in the World Bank at one time. And I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whether that&#13;
system still goes, but I guess they have them in all the government offices. And Mr.&#13;
Woods didnâ&#128;&#153;t really like that very much, and he told us to cool it. But it was a system&#13;
that was accepted in the World Bank, and everybody else had their secretaryâ&#128;&#153;s one ear to .&#13;
. . and with this little button you push you canâ&#128;&#153;t tell it was anybody else on the phone.&#13;
And Mr. Woods always liked to feel if he was on a phone call that it was a private&#13;
conversation.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: This wasnâ&#128;&#153;t for taping purposes like the [Richard M.] Nixon tapes in the&#13;
White House later?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Oh, no, no, no. No, as far as I know there were never any tapes in the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It was just a matter . . .&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Maybe we should have had them. It would have saved you all this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Bernadette Schmitt&#13;
                            July 20, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            9&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It was just a matter of maybe a secretary listening to an important&#13;
conversation and maybe making a few notes about it?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes, see, now some of the men depended on a secretary to listen in and&#13;
write down their meetings. Mr. Woods had sort of total recall on everything, and he&#13;
seldom needed a prop such as a secretary to confirm that he had made a date with such&#13;
and such because he was very meticulous about telling us right away if heâ&#128;&#153;d made an&#13;
appointment, and then it would immediately go on the calendar. So he didnâ&#128;&#153;t feel it was&#13;
necessary to have anyone monitoring his telephone calls. And that was just a personal&#13;
reaction. He never had it in his previous work.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Didnâ&#128;&#153;t want it in this one?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: He didnâ&#128;&#153;t really want it. No.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did he make any directives on this subject to other people in the Bank or was&#13;
this pretty much . . .&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: No, not really, but he made it known to us in our immediate offices, and I&#13;
think maybe Mr. McNamara did later on. It seems to me somebody told me that he had&#13;
stopped them from using these little bugs. I mean theâ&#128;&#148;not bugs, but they are little . . .&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sort of extensions?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: A little button that youâ&#128;&#148;the silent listener . . .&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sure. I understand.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: I donâ&#128;&#153;t know. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a dangerous thing in a way, I feel, but if everybody gets&#13;
accustomed to it and if they know it exists . . . Mr. Woods didnâ&#128;&#153;t know it existed at&#13;
firstâ&#128;&#148;but anyway he didnâ&#128;&#153;t like it, and he made it known in our immediate office.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: What would a typical day be like for Mr. Woods? Would he spend a large&#13;
part of the day on the telephone, plus meetings?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: A large part of the day on the telephone and the meetings. He had the&#13;
Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s Council which metâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#153;ve forgotten how often.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think almost every day at something like 9:30 in the morning.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes, about 9:00 or 9:30 I guess it was. Yes. And then theyâ&#128;&#153;d come in&#13;
ready for work, and he had just enough time to get his desk set up. Every night he took a&#13;
bagful of homework home with him, and I guess during the interim of his getting homeâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
whatâ&#128;&#153;d he leave?â&#128;&#148;about 6:00 or 6:30. I think he left fairly promptly because in&#13;
Washingtonâ&#128;&#148;see before we went to Washington he might work on into the evening until&#13;
7:00, 7:30 because there was nothing to do in between.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bernadette Schmitt&#13;
                             July 20, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            10&#13;
&#13;
And yet in Washington I think there were probably more social activities insofar as he&#13;
might have to stop for a drink someplace or stop for a reception someplace. And so his&#13;
time was more pressed. But I think in that way he kept a pretty regular day. I think he&#13;
came in at 9:00 and left pretty promptly around 6:00. As opposed to New York, he might&#13;
come in early and leave as late as seven oâ&#128;&#153;clock. I seldom made any dates before seven&#13;
oâ&#128;&#153;clock myself.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: How about weekends?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Weekends. You mean what? Washington or here or . . .&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Either.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Well, when I first came to work for First Boston we were on a 5 Â½ day&#13;
week. And so whenâ&#128;&#148;having been working in the Pentagon six days a week that seemed&#13;
like a breeze. But then after a year or two, they cut down to Monday to Friday. I forget&#13;
whether the Stock Exchange was ever open on Saturdays. I doubt it, but in any event, the&#13;
office was open a half day on Saturdays. And in Washington and New York, we always&#13;
had a duty person on the weekend, and if the wire room got a message through they had&#13;
to call one of the secretaries to be sure somebody knew about the message. Usually it&#13;
was some message from some far-off country. You know how a cablegram might be just&#13;
a routine cablegram, but it very often would show up on a weekend and somebody had to&#13;
know that it had come in. And very seldom any really pressing things came in over&#13;
weekends. One of us was to be called. It could have been Miss Linahan, or myself, or&#13;
Miss Ladue, or Mr. Wishart. Somebody, just so they had a record of it.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It is my impression that Mr. Woods kept his apartment in New York while he&#13;
was President of the World Bank. Do you know whether or not he would come back to&#13;
New York sometimes for weekends?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes, and they always had their home available to them whenever. Yes,&#13;
they would come up as often as they could or as often as necessary. Sometimes on&#13;
personal matters. Sometimes to meet with the World Bank people in New York or to&#13;
consult . . . if he had business at the United Nations, he would always use his apartment&#13;
as his headquarters. And I canâ&#128;&#153;t tell you what frequency, but maybe as much as once a&#13;
month.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Ah, but no more than that?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: It could have been. I just havenâ&#128;&#153;t gone over the records.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sure. Did Mr. Woods, and Mrs. Woods of course, entertain a fair amount in&#13;
Washington?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes. Official entertainment, basically. Yes, and they had quite a social&#13;
life. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve already sent the diaries that Miss Linahan was responsible for keepingâ&#128;&#148;the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bernadette Schmitt&#13;
                             July 20, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            11&#13;
social diaries for Mrs. Woodsâ&#128;&#148;and kept very good records of those years. And you could&#13;
get a better reading on that from those diaries.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sure. Do you know whether there are particular people in the Bank that Mr.&#13;
Woods relied heavily upon for consultation about Bank business? Obviously there were&#13;
the members of the Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s Council. Were there others beyond that?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Well, Irving Friedman was part of the Council. No, the Council members&#13;
were the main ones. Letâ&#128;&#153;s see, was Martin Rosen part of that too?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Occasionally, I am told. He was not an official member.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes, because he was head of the IFC [International Finance Corporation].&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: He was in some sense above the other members of the Council.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes, and he certainly consulted with heads of departments a lot and&#13;
consulted with Pierre-Paul Schweitzer a lot and just â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: How about executive directors?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes, he met with them regularly just as Mr. Blackâ&#128;&#148;Marie Linahan says&#13;
Mr. Black did. But, yes, Mr. Woods continued that practice of meeting with them. If&#13;
there was a particularly important loan coming up and they could discuss certain phases&#13;
of the loan ahead of time to smooth the way to having things approved, answered a lot of&#13;
questions ahead of time, and then it would come to the floor with the full Board.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I have been told by some that Mr. Woodsâ&#128;&#153; relations with some of the&#13;
members of the Board became more controversial in the last two years of his term as&#13;
President of the Bank. Were you ever aware of that?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Do you know any specifics?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, there were more Board meetings, I take it, because there was more&#13;
lending activity and more discussion of things like IDA. Because of IDA some of the&#13;
directors felt that they had more authority or wanted to have more authority in the&#13;
operations of the Bank than before and that on occasion Mr. Woods would answer&#13;
questions or comments from directors in a rather abrupt way so that some of the directors&#13;
and he seemed to have more controversy at official Board meetings in the last couple of&#13;
years than had been true in the first two or three years of the administration. Were you&#13;
aware of any change like this?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Not a real change like that, but just knowing how personalities either mesh&#13;
or donâ&#128;&#153;t mesh I think there are personality clashes very often thatâ&#128;&#148;and maybe Mr.&#13;
Woodsâ&#128;&#153; problems with the World Bank and funding and things like that weighed more&#13;
heavily on him. Maybe those things aggravated him, and maybe he was testier or&#13;
seemingly more difficult to deal with. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know.&#13;
&#13;

                                Bernadette Schmitt&#13;
                            July 20, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               12&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: It clearly wasnâ&#128;&#153;t apparent to you.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Not really, no. I mean it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t a big issue as far as I was concerned, but I&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t sit in on meetings. And Mr. Woods was never one to sit down and talk with me. I&#13;
had free access to his desk and any papers and all that. He felt that â&#128;&#147;not because it was&#13;
meâ&#128;&#148;but a waste of time to sit down and brief a secretary when, if she has sense at all,&#13;
she can read the papers on his desk and get anything that she needed. And he wasnâ&#128;&#153;t one&#13;
to consult with a secretary, no. He would go over papers with Mr. Wishart, his personal&#13;
assistant, and later Mr. Steckhan. They were a good liaison between himself and other&#13;
members of the staff, and very often he communicated through him or set up meetings&#13;
with special interests through his personal assistant.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: What can you say about the subject of his serving five yearsâ&#128;&#148;one term, so to&#13;
speak, and then three additional months? Do you have any idea whether at any point he&#13;
thought that he would like to serve a second term as President?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: No. No. Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure he didnâ&#128;&#153;t. Unless youâ&#128;&#153;ve heard to the contrary. I had&#13;
never gathered that at all. No, I feel he went down for a five-year period, and he felt that&#13;
he had moved it in a direction that he thought should be taken and that another five years&#13;
wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t move it that much more in any other direction. So I think he was ready to step&#13;
down. He was then 66, so I donâ&#128;&#153;t think he saw himself serving another five years and&#13;
going on into the seventies. He wanted Mr. McNamara to be his successor, and then the&#13;
three months into 1968, as I recollect. I think it was pretty much decided by the end of&#13;
September or the beginning of October--maybe as early as the time of the Annual&#13;
Meeting in Rio in 1967â&#128;&#148;that Mr. McNamara would take the job. It had been cleared&#13;
with Lyndon Johnson. I think Mr. Woods was ready to step down any time that all the&#13;
things could be put in motion. Mr. McNamara understandably had some loose ends to tie&#13;
up in the Pentagon, to make an orderly transition from the Pentagon to the World Bank, it&#13;
took that extra time.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: And I think that was the only reason that you might have gotten the&#13;
impression he was going to try to stay on. No, I think he was satisfied that his phase in&#13;
the World Bank was finished. And he actively sought somebody to take his place.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Do you know whether he actively considered people other than Mr.&#13;
McNamara as his successor?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Well, Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure he did, but I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t name one of them, really.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: So much of that too wasâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure he probably consulted with Eugene&#13;
Black at the time.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                              13&#13;
OLIVER: Well, Iâ&#128;&#153;m now about to ask you about trips. Could you say a word about the&#13;
reason for the trips and how often Mr. Woods went on trips?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Just tell a little bit about the trips in general.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Well, the trips were set very often with whole staff. If he was going to&#13;
India, for instance, theyâ&#128;&#153;d have the staff like Mr. Peter Cargill or Mr. [Gregory] Votaw or&#13;
members of the Bank staff who were following a particular issue in a particular country,&#13;
and they might precede him to that particular country and set up meetings&#13;
with the government officials. And I canâ&#128;&#153;t tell you exactly how often he went on trips.&#13;
Sometimes he would take a briefer trip, and Mrs. Woods would not go along. As youâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
seen from her journals, those were the major trips that they made. And he made certain&#13;
trips to give a speech, and they werenâ&#128;&#153;t the kinds of trips where Mrs. Woodsâ&#128;&#148;if she did&#13;
indeed go with himâ&#128;&#148;where sheâ&#128;&#153;d write a journal. But when she went on a trip of any&#13;
length, she usually did write. Sheâ&#128;&#153;d take his Dictet machine along and dictate into that.&#13;
And now I canâ&#128;&#153;t get her to even do a little tape like yours.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did you go on any trips?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: No, I never went on any trips except the two trips on World Bank Annual&#13;
Meetings, and they were keenly interesting. Basically it was like being back at home&#13;
because he tried to run the office and keep the day-to-day business going also within&#13;
limits. But they were very interesting in both cases. I went to Japan in 1964. And I&#13;
guess I had about one week more than the length of the meeting for vacation and went to&#13;
Hong Kong and saw a little bit of Tokyo. And it was very interesting. And then to Rio in&#13;
1967. It was another work meeting.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sure. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been told, but I canâ&#128;&#153;t remember by whom, that not infrequently the&#13;
Woods took their own bottled water with them on the trips.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Probably.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Itâ&#128;&#153;s not something that you â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: No, I just wasnâ&#128;&#153;t really aware of the particulars of their luggage, but it&#13;
doesnâ&#128;&#153;t surprise me because Mrs. Woods has always been an advocate of drinking Evian&#13;
or any of the waters that are bottled in any country.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, before I ask you a little bit about your work as secretary for Mr. Woods&#13;
after he left the Bank, let me just ask are there things that I should have asked you about&#13;
the Woodsâ&#128;&#153; years in the Bank and I havenâ&#128;&#153;t? In other words, can you add to the record&#13;
beyond what weâ&#128;&#153;ve been talking about?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: I donâ&#128;&#153;t think so. They lived in the Sheraton Park Hotel all the while they&#13;
were there. They had a beautiful apartment. Mrs. Woods always wanted to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bernadette Schmitt&#13;
                             July 20, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               14&#13;
surrounded by nice things, and she went down to the storage rooms and fished around until&#13;
she got all the furniture that she wanted in their apartment. It was all rental, and I guess&#13;
you probably know that they have a cost-of-living allowance and so forth in the Bank and&#13;
then another allowance for entertaining. And that was all one of the financial&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: And Miss Linahan was very helpful in keeping all those records of how&#13;
many people attended. It all had to be done very meticulously, and she helped Mrs.&#13;
Woods on social activities along with Marjorie Billings, the lady whose funeral I attended&#13;
a few years ago. She worked closely with Personnel and Staff Relations, and she helped&#13;
Mrs. Woods. She was most helpful to Mrs. Woods on social events. And Mrs. Woods&#13;
started a group. She felt that the ladies should get acquainted and get, you know, to help&#13;
acclimate them to life in Washington. Wives of the various executives would get&#13;
together regularly. Mrs. Woods was a very social person and loved getting things started.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think she worked particularly hard at helping the wives of staff members&#13;
and indeed executive directors from other countries . .&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Right, right.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: . . feel at home in the Bank. Did she not?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes. Yes, she did. She was very good at it, and Mr. [Bogomir] Chokel&#13;
tells me the story about how she used to come to all the art exhibits. Being an artist, heâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
aware that sheâ&#128;&#153;s very interested in coming to the art exhibits every year. And she kept&#13;
very active. She had a nice relationship with most of the ladies in the Bank, and a lot of&#13;
the wives of executive directors. She had lots of pictures. And sheâ&#128;&#153;s kept up a&#13;
relationship with so many of the wives of executive directors plus wives of ambassadors&#13;
that were there in Washington during their stay.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Do you happen to remember offhand which wives on the staff she most often&#13;
called upon for help?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Do you know Mr. [Abdel Galeel] El Emary?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I know of him. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve never met him.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: She was rather close to Mrs. Shoaib, Mohamed Shoaib. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know all of&#13;
them, but those two stand out. She advised themâ&#128;&#148;Mrs. El Emary is from Egypt and&#13;
Mrs. Shoaib from Pakistan. And she had special relationships with them, and I think to&#13;
some degree with Mrs. [J. Burke] Knapp. Mrs. Knappâ&#128;&#153;s interests lay in the theatre a lot.&#13;
A lot of these people had been in Washington for years before the Woodses got there, so&#13;
the old timers who were well established in Washington didnâ&#128;&#153;t need help as much as the&#13;
newcomers and people from far away places who might need a little more help in getting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bernadette Schmitt&#13;
                             July 20, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             15&#13;
acquainted and so forth. She liked particularly helping people from other countries to get&#13;
established and to make friends and be included.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Mr. Woods stepped down as President the end of March 1968.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And stayed in Washington a couple of months I guess.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: And then came back to New York. And you came to New York, too, I think.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: I came back in June that year, yes. Because there was a certain amount of&#13;
carryover, and we had to get an office established in New York. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to go back&#13;
to the main office of First Boston, and he . . .&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Where was the main office then?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: At 20 Exchange Place. We had just moved into that building in 1962 about&#13;
six months before he left. Having been Chairman for a number of years, he didnâ&#128;&#153;t want&#13;
to go back and be untapped. I mean he had a feeling that he was no longer management&#13;
and a lot of the young fellows who had come in when he was Chairmanâ&#128;&#148;he didnâ&#128;&#153;t want&#13;
to have them feel that they had to consult with him. And so he got Mr. [Emil] Pattberg to&#13;
agree to set up an office uptown, and then we found this place in 277 Park. It was a&#13;
sublease in a company called Callahan Mining. And thatâ&#128;&#153;s an interesting thing there.&#13;
When in the Pentagon, we used to work with a fellow by the name of Joe Hall. I think he&#13;
was a lieutenant or something like that at the time. He was then President of Callahan&#13;
Mining, and we hadnâ&#128;&#153;t seen him in all those years, but here he was our landlord all of a&#13;
sudden. It brought back a friendship from many years ago.&#13;
&#13;
But anyway we stayed there then, and he could carry on whatever activities he had. He&#13;
took on the Rockefeller mission when they traveled to the Latin American countries in&#13;
the late sixtiesâ&#128;&#148;1969 I think it was. And then heâ&#128;&#153;d joined the staff of International&#13;
Executive Service Corps. Have you interviewed Frank Pace? Well, he was with that. A&#13;
lot of these things were started by the Rockefellers, one or the other. Nelson Rockefeller&#13;
started the New York State Urban Development Corporation, and he wanted Mr. Woods&#13;
to be Chairman of that. And then they found Edward Loeb from Boston. Well, from&#13;
Boston and Yale, I guess. And he was made President of that. Do you have much on&#13;
that?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, I have the files. I have not talked to anybody in an oral history way&#13;
about that.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes. And then that sort of ran into troubles in the middle seventies, I guess&#13;
right about the time Nelson Rockefeller was stepping down and the city was going&#13;
through a financial crisis, they suddenly hit on letâ&#128;&#153;s go get UDC. So that sort of fell&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bernadette Schmitt&#13;
                             July 20, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           16&#13;
apart, and there were hearings on it and everything. And I think Mr. Woods came out&#13;
pretty clean on everything. It was a financial crisis, and the UDC seems to be alive and&#13;
healthy today soâ&#128;&#148;the city was having its financial crisis.&#13;
&#13;
And then he had the Commission on Critical Choices, which Nelson Rockefeller started.&#13;
And then he was on Commission on Horse Racing in New York State. The off track&#13;
betting people versus the race tracks. Mr. Woods served on that committee, but I think a&#13;
fellow by the name of Delafield chaired it. And I donâ&#128;&#153;t know if they everâ&#128;&#148;they had a&#13;
report on it and everything, but I donâ&#128;&#153;t thinkâ&#128;&#148;nothing changed. They still have the OTB&#13;
[off track betting]. I think the Racing Commission felt that OTB was taking away from&#13;
the race tracks too much and, and they probably did.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did Mr. Woods maintain contact with people in the World Bank after he&#13;
retired to New York?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes, to a big degree. Mr. McNamara consulted with him some. Not a great&#13;
deal. But some. And Mr. [Simon] Aldewereld and he were friends. Mr. Friedman. He,&#13;
I think, purposefully stayed away from the Annual Meetings because he didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to be&#13;
in the way. Itâ&#128;&#153;s like youâ&#128;&#153;re finished with this, and you step in the background.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did Mr. Black ever attend Annual Meetings after he stepped down as&#13;
President that you remember?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Maybe for a few years. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure. He used to show up. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know&#13;
whether he attended the meetings particularly, but he would show up in Washington. I&#13;
think there was a pretty good relationship before and during and after the World Bank&#13;
years.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Did Mr. Woods ever go on any missions, so to speak, lead any missions for&#13;
the World Bank after he stopped being President?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Not really.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: No.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Then later, several years later, he got involved in the Foreign Bondholders&#13;
Protective Council, and he brought that along as far as he could. But he wasnâ&#128;&#153;t really&#13;
invited to Washington to serve on any big things in the World Bank after he left.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think that he increased again his interest in the theater, did he not? In the&#13;
years after he retired from the Bank, didnâ&#128;&#153;t he and Mrs . . .&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes, they are good theater goers. They always were. He was interested in&#13;
the Repertory Theatre of Lincoln Center, which he had once been President of. He was&#13;
there in the early days of that--on the Board of Lincoln Center. And then he was&#13;
President specifically of the Repertory Theatre of Lincoln Center, and I think served on&#13;
that even during the World Bank years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Bernadette Schmitt&#13;
                             July 20, 1986 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               17&#13;
&#13;
And then Eugene Black, Jr., I think, got interested in that. He had a mild interest. I think&#13;
in Mr. Votawâ&#128;&#153;s paper there was something about his making a lot of money in the theater,&#13;
and I doubt it. But anyway, he had backed a couple of plays in the thirties probably. The&#13;
Four Horsemen and Sailor Beware.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, he maintained the office on Park Avenue that was leased for him&#13;
specifically until 1983 was it?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: 1982.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: 1982.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: Yes. We left that office partly because the whole company was moving&#13;
uptown. We had a very nice space there, but I guess he felt by that time as long as the&#13;
main company was moving uptown to its new building that it was probably the right&#13;
thing. And also at the same time Chemical Bank was in the process of getting rid of all&#13;
their outside tenants because they wanted to make that building their international&#13;
headquarters, which it is now. And so our immediate landlord when we first startedâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
Callahan Miningâ&#128;&#148;had moved out. They had been subtenants of Witco, I believe, and&#13;
then had released this 2,200 square feet of space to First Boston for Mr. Woods.&#13;
&#13;
And so then Witco was our immediate landlord, and they were being asked to leave.&#13;
They had to find new space at the same time we were moving into Park Avenue Plaza.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: What is the address of Park Avenue Plaza?&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: 55 East Fifty-Second.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Well, I think that brings us very nearly up to date. I think this has been a very&#13;
interesting interview, and I appreciate it very much.&#13;
&#13;
SCHMITT: I wish I could be more interesting but . . .&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Youâ&#128;&#153;re very interesting, and I think that your summary of the details will be&#13;
very useful in the Archives of the Bank as well as your recollection of certain events in&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s history which are unlikely to turn up anywhere else.&#13;
