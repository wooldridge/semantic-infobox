AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT&#13;
1. COUNTRY AND SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Macroeconomic Context&#13;
1.1         Prior to 1992, Ecuador discriminated against agriculture for most of thirty&#13;
years, as it followed an import substitution model of industrialization for economic&#13;
development. The effects of this policy, which included high tariffs, subsidized interest&#13;
rates and an expansionary fiscal policy, were accentuated by the petroleum boom of the&#13;
1970s that led to an overvalued exchange rate. The net result was that the model&#13;
subsidized industry and urban dwellers, and discriminated heavily against agriculture and&#13;
rural areas. Certain compensatory measures, such as subsidized credit, public sector&#13;
irrigation and mechanization subsidies benefited only a small group of select farmers.&#13;
1.2         The present Government has implemented a series of macroeconomic&#13;
policy reforms, building on thoseintroduced by Governments in the 1980s.1 Tariff and&#13;
non-tariff barriers to trade have been reduced substantially or removed, interest rates are&#13;
market determined, exchange rates are allowed to fluctuate, energy prices have been&#13;
increased, privatization of Government enterprises has started, and the Government has&#13;
followed a more conservative fiscal policy. In all, over 30,000 public sector jobs have&#13;
been eliminated.&#13;
1.3         The Government also has implemented some sectoral policy reforms for&#13;
agriculture, based on a program of modernization of the public sector. The state system&#13;
of agricultural price supports has been eliminated, except for a few export crops, and&#13;
storage silos sold or leased out. A new Agrarian Law has been passed which will make&#13;
land and water markets more efficient, and which eliminates the outdated land reform law.&#13;
IERAC (now INDA), the land titling agency, is in the process of being restructured.&#13;
Restrictions on agricultural exports have been removed. Irigation policy has been&#13;
reformed with; the substantial downsizing of INERHI, the regionalization of public&#13;
projects, the shifting of operation and maintenance of public systems to private water&#13;
users, and the introduction of mechanisms for greater cost recovery. In the area of&#13;
agricultural research, through a law passed by Congress in 1992, the National Institute for&#13;
Agriculture and Livestock Research (INIAP) was awarded administrative autonomy and&#13;
access to an endowment fund paid for by the National Treasury. Both the IDB and the&#13;
World Bank have strongly supported all of these reforms through the IDB Sector Loan,&#13;
and the World Bank Technical Assistance Project for Irrigation.&#13;

1.4         However, reforms to the sector are still not complete. Reference prices are&#13;
still being maintained for exports of coffee, cacao and bananas. ENAC still is involved in&#13;
price supports through the market for CDs. Water rights can only be transferred with&#13;
land, unless there is specific Government approval. And several Government agencies still&#13;
need to be restructured or privatized.&#13;
1.5         The net effect of the macroeconomic and sectoral reforms, referred to&#13;
above, is to increase incentives for agriculture and thereby create the conditions for it to&#13;
be a dynamic and sustainable contributor to the overall economy. This in turn, will&#13;
provide a much more positive basis upon which the modernization of the agricultural&#13;
research system can proceed. These changes will put new demands on the system and it's&#13;
on this basis that the project is designed.&#13;
B. Agriculture in the Economy&#13;
1.6         Agriculture is still the dominant sector of the Ecuadoran economy. In&#13;
1994 it accounted for 17 percent of GDP, 33 percent of foreign exchange earnings, and is&#13;
the major source of employment in the economy accounting for 35 percent of formal and&#13;
the bulk of informal employment. After a period of slow growth prior to 1980, the sector&#13;
has shown impressive growth over the past decade and a half, having risen from&#13;
13.2 percent in 1980 to 17 percent of GDP in 1994. However, physical growth came&#13;
almost exclusively from an expansion in area. Yield data for the seven principal crops&#13;
show that the average growth in production, between 1980 and 1992 was 3.58 percent per&#13;
annum, with area expansion at 4.55 percent and yields declining at a rate of -0.93 percent&#13;
per annum.2 The growth in animal production is also reflected in the increase in the area&#13;
dedicated to pastures, which has increased from 2.1 million ha in 1974 to 4.9 million ha in&#13;
1992.&#13;
1.7         Ecuadoran agriculture in general is characterized by low yields. A&#13;
comparison with Colombia, where the range of crops and growing conditions are similar,&#13;
shows yields of the main crops in Ecuador ranging from 52 percent to 27 percent lower&#13;
than those in Colombia. Even in the case of its main export crop, bananas, technology&#13;
levels fall will behind that of its main competitors. Under this scenario, with land&#13;
productivity declining and available land resources diminishing, the development strategy&#13;
must be changed to a "science-based" approach concentrating on the improvement of the&#13;
productivity of sustainable agricultural systems. This will be the challenge of this project.&#13;

C. Agricultural Institutions and Services&#13;
Research&#13;
1.8         This activity is carried out by INIAP, universities and the private sector.&#13;
Annual expenditure is calculated at about US$7.4 million, with about 200 scientists being&#13;
engaged in conducting, supporting and managing research.&#13;
1.9         INIAP which was founded in 1959 as the research institute of the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture has been the prime recipient of public funds for agricultural research. It has&#13;
seven research stations and a number of experimental farms and conducts research on&#13;
about thirty different crop and livestock species. Part of its land is used for seed&#13;
production and commercial farming. Over the years, from being a well-focused&#13;
organization that produced good results, it developed into a very weak organization that&#13;
maintained little of its original objectives. From the foundation of INIAP up to 1975,&#13;
public investments in agricultural research increased steadily, reaching a high of&#13;
0.85 percent of AgGDP in 1975. This level of investment compared very favorably with&#13;
that of other LAC countries. However, since then, public investments have been&#13;
drastically reduced and were only 0.25 percent of AgGDP in 1992. The result was a&#13;
serious decline in INIAPs executive and scientific capacity. Simultaneously, due to&#13;
political pressures it expanded its program beyond its budgetary capacity, reducing its&#13;
operational funds and making it very unattractive for good researchers to stay.&#13;
1.10        To overcome this downward spiral the Congress approved a law in 1992&#13;
giving INIAP administrative autonomy. Along with this autonomy it was assigned by law&#13;
an endowment fund of approximately US$10 million. This endowment fund is to be&#13;
added to yearly by the National Treasury. This autonomy - although the institute is still&#13;
almost totally dependent for its budget on the MAG - has brought many changes to the&#13;
organization. It has set its own salary scale, has reduced its personnel by about 30 percent&#13;
and is now developing a new set of research priorities. This is an ongoing process with&#13;
the objective of a smaller, better focused and more relevant institution. Following the&#13;
recent downsizing INIAP has six Ph.D., 65 M.S., and 123 other graduates (including&#13;
those in training) in a total staff of 433. Its 1995 budget is of the order of US$4.2 million&#13;
(see Annex 3).&#13;
1.11        In the case of universities, most have limited research equipment, lands&#13;
and libraries. Although there are 25 faculties of agricultural and veterinary science, many&#13;
faculty are part-time and of a total of 1,253 professional staff in 1992, only 70 had&#13;
M.S. degrees and nine had Ph.Ds. In theory, university research should be well funded by&#13;
the National Council for Universities (CONUEP) which is supposed to receive one&#13;
percent of GDP for research grants. In practice the Government has never met this&#13;
obligation and in 1992 CONUEP received only US$1.3 million or under 0.01 percent of&#13;
GDP. About 20 percent of this is allocated for projects in the agriculture sector. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
addition to CONUEP funds, some universities have been able to solicit funds from&#13;
international and local sources. These are usually for small projects (see Annex 3).&#13;
1.12         The participation of the private sector in the generation of technology has&#13;
been increasing in recent years. It now funds and executes research in a variety of&#13;
commodities, such as maize, banana, coffee, palm oil, horticultural crops, flowers, milk&#13;
processing and a variety of other activities. These activities are concentrated in the&#13;
applied end of the research spectrum such as the development of hybrid seeds, field testing&#13;
of agrochemical, in vitro reproduction of plant materials, etc., and are an important source&#13;
of ready to use technology. A recent study4 of private sector agricultural research identified&#13;
nine organizations that were involved in some depth, with 22 professionals and 24 technicians,&#13;
including three Ph.Ds and M.Scs. These are much smaller numbers of researchers than at&#13;
INIAP although their estimated 1991 annual budget (US$3.1 million) was 75 percent as large.&#13;
This was attributable to better salaries and a much higher technician to researcher ratio.&#13;
Research is also being carried out in Ecuador by foreign research institutes (e.g., CIRAD, CIP,&#13;
CIAT), usually in collaboration with INIAP and is often funded by donors such as COTESU,&#13;
USAID or IDRC (CEOD).&#13;
1.13         Farmers associations have not as yet been an important source of financing&#13;
for agricultural research. They usually place more emphasis on policy activities where&#13;
they defend the interests of their associates. However in some cases they have financed&#13;
agricultural extension in a very limited way. The Government is currently processing new&#13;
legislation to promote the formation of producer associations (gremios) and this could have a&#13;
mraor influence on the direction of research in the future. Financial support from farmers will&#13;
be critical for the long-term sustainability of the research system, because it is through such&#13;
support that farmers research needs can be expressed, leading to a more demand-driven&#13;
system.&#13;
Extension&#13;
1.14         Public agricultural extension in Ecuador exists since 1945, having been&#13;
financed under a variety of programs and donors. In recent times the largest effort in this&#13;
area has been the Agricultural and Livestock Technology Development Program&#13;
(PROTECA), which had an extension component, and which was financed by the Inter-&#13;
American Development Bank (IDB) and executed by MAG. This project terminated in&#13;
September 1994. This program financed about 500 public extensionists to give technical&#13;
assistance to about 85,000 small and medium sized farmers. However, the MAG has not&#13;
institutionalized the system and when the project finished there were about 400 trained&#13;
extensionists available to be employed in other activities.&#13;
1.15         Besides PROTECA there have been other donor funded projects in&#13;
agricultural extension such as: the Research, Extension and Education Project funded by&#13;
4 Falcoi, Ccsa A. 1992, Public and Private Sector Interactions in Agricultural Research in Less-&#13;
Developed Countries: The Case ofEcuador. ISNAR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
USAID and executed by FUNDAGRO; the Technology Transfer Groups (GTT) funded&#13;
by Swiss Aid (COTESU) and executed by INIAP; the Livestock Development Program&#13;
(PROFOGAN) funded by the German Government and executed by MAG and some&#13;
universities; and the agricultural extension component of the PRONADER project funded&#13;
by the World Bank. For the past thirty years, many NGOs, both national and international&#13;
have been active in the area of agricultural extension. These organizations have worked&#13;
with the poorest farmers in the marginal areas.&#13;
1.16        IDB has prepared an agricultural extension project, as a part of the&#13;
Modernization of Agricultural Services Program, which also includes this project. The&#13;
extension project will focus both on competitive and small farmer agriculture. It aims to&#13;
increase the participation of the private sector by contracting implementation of the&#13;
project to private firms and in the case of competitive agriculture by introducing cost&#13;
recovery mechanisms which in the long run should lead to greater private sector&#13;
participation in the financing of the service.&#13;
Plant and Animal Health&#13;
1.17        These activities are presently executed by specific programs within MAG&#13;
under the direction of the Technical Subsecretary. Present activities of the Government&#13;
are concentrated in the areas of import and export quarantine, control of the movement of&#13;
animal and vegetable products, disease and pest control programs, register and control of&#13;
agriculture and veterinary products, diagnostic laboratories, control of packing houses and&#13;
the inspection of meat and other agricultural products. These services have been&#13;
characterized by the lack of operating budget and adequately trained personnel. Because&#13;
of this, the results have not been very good, with the entry of new pests and diseases&#13;
adding to the problems caused by the traditional endemic ones. There have been other&#13;
complications such as an increase in the residues of antibiotics, pesticides and other&#13;
contaminants found in food supplies. EDB has prepared a project for the establishment of&#13;
a new national Plant and Animal Health Service, as part of the Modernization of&#13;
Agricultural Services Program.&#13;
2. AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH&#13;
A. Research Expenditures&#13;
2.1         The greater part of agricultural research in Ecuador is funded by the public&#13;
sector. Public expenditure on agricultural research can be justified for a number of&#13;
reasons, the three principal ones being: "market failure" because firms or individuals&#13;
cannot capture sufficient benefits to justify the investment; natural resource research which&#13;
benefits all of society; and social equity. As Ecuador looks to the future and the need to&#13;
increase its investments in agricultural research, neither the public nor the private sectors&#13;
alone will be capable of responding to the research needs of the sector. One of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
challenges will be to develop funding systems that use both public and private resources in&#13;
an efficient way.&#13;
2.2         Public investments in agricultural research (in INIAP and the universities)&#13;
have declined steadily in real terms since 1975. Public research expenditures as a share of&#13;
AgGDP also declined steadily after 1975 and were only .25 percent in 1993 compared to a&#13;
high of .85 percent in 1975. While no historical data are available on private sector&#13;
investments in agricultural research, it is clear that the sector has increased its investments&#13;
as Government support eroded. It is estimated that total (public plus private) research&#13;
investment in 1993 to be US$7.4 million or .43 percent of AgGDP, which is only slightly&#13;
above fifty percent of the level of public investment in 1975 (see Annex 3).&#13;
2.3         While there are empirical recommendations as to an appropriate level of&#13;
investment in agricultural research there is no simple formula available to determine how&#13;
much money should be invested and subjective judgment is relied on when making such&#13;
decisions. This being the case, then an important criterion for Ecuador should be the level&#13;
of investment of its competitors and short to medium term projections for investment&#13;
should be brought in line with these levels.&#13;
2.4         Even with private sector research, Ecuador has made very limited&#13;
investments in comparison to the rest of the developing world. Data for 52 developing&#13;
countries showed an average investment in agricultural research of .94 percent of AgGDP&#13;
during 1980-1985, up from .69 percent during 1970-1979. Thus, Ecuador sharply&#13;
reduced its investments in agricultural research while most of its competitors were&#13;
increasing their investments. Ecuador compares quite poorly with its regional trading&#13;
partners in terms of investments in agricultural research. According to IDB, in 1993 Peru&#13;
invested close to one percent of its AgGDP in agricultural research (not including private&#13;
sector investments) or four times more than Ecuador. Colombia also invested more than&#13;
Ecuador, at 0.5 percent of its AgGDP in 1991. These bordering countries are Ecuador&#13;
most important competitors in the Andean Pact, both for lucrative export markets in the&#13;
U.S. and Europe, and for provision of food and fiber supplies in the region. The fact that&#13;
Peru and Colombia are investing so much more in agricultural research puts significant&#13;
pressure on Ecuador to increase its investments and reform its research system (see&#13;
Annex 3).&#13;
B. Government Agricultural Technology Strategy&#13;
Public Private Roles&#13;
2.5         Research activities are spread across a continuum that ranges from basic at&#13;
one end through strategic and applied research to adaptive research at the other end.&#13;
Depending on the appropriability of the results and the level of risk involved, private and&#13;
public sectors can participate and interact along that continuum. Practice has shown that&#13;
private sector efforts are more concentrated in the applied and adaptive end of the&#13;
continuum whereas public funding focuses on basic and strategic research activities along&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
with areas that have to do with social equity, poverty alleviation and the environment. In&#13;
an effective system public and private research complement each other, because each&#13;
sector is involved in different types of activities along the research spectrum. Historically,&#13;
public investment has been the springboard for private involvement in research in&#13;
developed countries.&#13;
2.6         It is generally accepted that in countries with the same level of&#13;
development as Ecuador that there is a large public good component in agricultural&#13;
research. However, as the economy develops further the private sector will participate to&#13;
an increasing degree. It is important to define in principle the public good component of&#13;
research and to have funding mechanisms in place that can respond to the system as it&#13;
evolves to increasing private sector participation.&#13;
2.7          The strategy of the present Government is to revitalize the agricultural&#13;
research system by; increasing overall funding and putting in place incentives, in the form&#13;
of funding mechanisms, that will increase the participation of other organizations (private&#13;
sector, universities and NGOs) both in the implementation and financing of research.&#13;
C. Bank Experience in Agricultural Sector Lending&#13;
2.8         Bank projects in Ecuador have repeatedly encountered weaknesses in&#13;
public sector management and coordination. These include excessive bureaucracy,&#13;
inadequate personnel incentive structures, and shortages of trained people at all levels.&#13;
The institutional capacity to absorb technical assistance is frequently limited. Leadership&#13;
mandates are often superficial and/or fleeting and agency management turns over&#13;
frequently. Projects require the explicit definition of issues and objectives during&#13;
identification and preparation, and a tight focus on a limited number of components.&#13;
Careful attention is needed to limiting the longer-term burden on the recurrent budget, and&#13;
human resource development should be given high priority. Regular, intensive supervision&#13;
is needed to keep components on track.&#13;
2.9         The Bank has supported and continues to support agricultural research in a&#13;
number of ways; as freestanding research projects, as components in rural development&#13;
projects, in education projects and in policy-based lending. Since the beginning of FY78&#13;
the Bank has been involved in freestanding research projects with total project costs of&#13;
US$3.8 billion and a loan amount of US$1.7 billion. Research components in other&#13;
projects have cost close to US$2.0 billion with a loan amount of US$0.5 billion.&#13;
According to the OED database, the results have been relatively favorable with 78 percent&#13;
rated as "satisfactory". Despite this positive rating common problems have been identified&#13;
across the range of projects. These problems are; inadequate counterpart funding,&#13;
overdimensioning in relation to prospective resources, lack of capacity to plan and set&#13;
research priorities, and lack of demand driven research.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Origin and Rationale for World Bank Involvement&#13;
3.1         The 1992 Ecuador Agricultural Sector Review highlighted three broad&#13;
problems facing the agricultural sector: (i) unrealized sectoral growth; (ii) deforestation&#13;
and soil erosion from rapid expansion of the crop and livestock frontiers, raising serious&#13;
concerns about the sustainability of sectoral growth; and (iii) acute and widespread rural&#13;
poverty. This project addresses (i) and (ii) through strengthening the agricultural research&#13;
system so as to increase productivity and thereby have more efficient growth and less&#13;
exploitation of the natural resource base. While it is not a direct poverty intervention it&#13;
has important implications for rural poverty as the research priorities, i. e., rice, potatoes,&#13;
maize, etc., being financed under the project are of importance to small farmers as&#13;
illustrated in the recent Poverty Report (June 30, 1995). As the project is expected to&#13;
increase agricultural productivity it will also increase economic opportunities in rural areas&#13;
and halt the deterioration of the natural resource base which is tightly linked to rural&#13;
poverty. Through increased food production it will also maintain an adequate supply of&#13;
cheap food for poor consumers. This project is fully consistent with the CAS that is being&#13;
presented to the Board on April 4, 1996, and would support three of the broad objectives&#13;
for Ecuador: poverty alleviation, by focusing research on basic food commodities grown&#13;
by resource poor farmers; institutional strengthening, by modernizing INRAP through its&#13;
Development Plan; and private sector development, by opening research funding to a&#13;
range of institutions, including foundations, universities and NGOs.&#13;
3.2          The project is a component of the Modernization of Agricultural Services&#13;
Program by the Ministry of Agriculture. The other two components, Technology&#13;
Transfer and Plant and Animal Health are being financed separately by IDB for a total&#13;
project cost of US$41 million (paras. 1.16 and 1.17). The overall program which will be&#13;
managed by the Project Implementation Unit within MAG, is aimed at strengthening the&#13;
range of public services needed for a modern and competitive agricultural sector.&#13;
3.3         The justification for public investments in agricultural research is that some&#13;
of the results of such an activity are public goods. Private agents do not have the full&#13;
incentives to invest in such goods. Public subsidies, rather than full cost recovery from&#13;
agricultural producers benefiting from research are also justified, because benefits from&#13;
such research flow to consumers and the environment. They flow to consumers via long-&#13;
term commodity price decreases which affect the poorer classes disproportionately in a&#13;
beneficial way, and the environment benefits through more efficient use of natural&#13;
resources. This latter is very important in Ecuador as most of its agricultural growth in&#13;
the last fifteen years has come from expanding area under cultivation and pastures thereby&#13;
increasing erosion and lowering biodiversity. Under the economic framework of more&#13;
open markets and increased trade, Ecuador will be under increased pressure to modernize&#13;
its agriculture and compete internationally. Because of new developments in science, of&#13;
which the country has not taken advantage for at least fifteen years, and the present low&#13;
productivity levels (see Annex 3), the agricultural research system is presented with new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
demands and also opportunities to lead the sector in renewed and efficient growth. This&#13;
project will assist in orienting this public investment to more efficient uses in line with the&#13;
Governments objectives for agricultural research.&#13;
3.4          Support for the project is also warranted on the basis of past results.&#13;
Although support for agricultural research has unstable and declining over the past twenty&#13;
years in Ecuador, the system has been successful in general and in some areas has made&#13;
major contributions. Joint research on rice by INIAP, universities and international&#13;
agencies resulted in returns of 34 percent between 1970 and 1990. A series of related&#13;
studies carried out by INIAP with support from ISNAR and FUNDAGRO revealed the&#13;
following rates of return to research investments: hard corn, 70 percent; African palm,&#13;
32 percent; potatoes, 33 percent; soybeans, 17 percent; and wheat, 29 percent.5 An&#13;
economic evaluation of both research and extension, the latter being financed by IDB, was&#13;
carried out as part of the initial preparation. This study gave an internal rate of return of&#13;
44.5 percent based on certain assumptions as to changes in productivity and prices. There&#13;
are limitations on the validity of such an evaluation, since not all productivity increases can&#13;
be attributed directly to research and extension alone, and the assumptions are based on&#13;
data from past experience. The full results of the economic evaluation are available in the&#13;
project file (Annex 11).&#13;
B. Economic Evaluation&#13;
3.5          Economic analysis for the project has been carried out to test its economic&#13;
viability. A multiple criteria model has been utilized in light of the fact that agricultural&#13;
research is focused upon different objectives such as: economic growth, distribution of&#13;
income and sustainability; multiple criteria models seem to be more appropriate to&#13;
evaluate the attainment of different objectives. The model used (MODEXC, developed in&#13;
1990 by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture) is a partial equilibrium model&#13;
which evaluates the direct benefits of new technology and associated income distribution&#13;
results.&#13;
3.6          The social benefits and costs for each technological option are estimated&#13;
and benefits of each technology are distributed among specific activities (such as genetic&#13;
improvements or new fertilization systems). This process allows estimation of economic&#13;
efficiency for each activity.&#13;
3.7          The selection of commodities considered under the analysis is based on the&#13;
relative weight that each commodity holds in the gross national agricultural product&#13;
(GNAP). The GNAP used in this case represents the average for years 1991 through&#13;
1993. The result is a group of 16 products that accounts for over 90 percent of the total&#13;
aggregate value of domestic production. Based on INIAP historical data, average annual&#13;
growth rate and price projections are estimated for each commodity (see Annex 4 for&#13;
5 INIAP 1993 Retorno a las Inversiones en Investigacidn Agropecuaria Quito: Direccidn de&#13;
Planificaci6n.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
details). These projections have been incorporated in the economic model in order to&#13;
estimate overall technology benefits.&#13;
3.8         Assumptions regarding the following have also been included in the model:&#13;
(a) exogenous growth and demand rates for commodities; (b) the consumption structure&#13;
of commodities relative to beneficiary incomes; (c) farm data representative of&#13;
beneficiaries; (d) yields of new and present technologies; (e) the time required to&#13;
implement and adopt new technologies; (f) the area to which new technologies are&#13;
applied; (g) research required to obtain new technologies and the probability of success for&#13;
such research; and (h) research and technology costs. This data allows for the estimation&#13;
of increased production because of technological change and its adoption by farmers. This&#13;
is purely technical information, taken directly at INIAP's research stations, from&#13;
interviews with different commodity research specialists.&#13;
3.9         Based on the above, the model estimates producers and consumer&#13;
surpluses, separating those that can be ascribed to technological factors. The benefits&#13;
ascribed to the project are estimated to be only thirty percent of the surpluses, multiplied&#13;
by the probability of success (about 75 to 80 percent) for each technology through the&#13;
research and transfer process. As demonstrated in Annex 4, net benefits from the project&#13;
are estimated at nearly US$176 million in year 15. Considering benefit flows for all years&#13;
and the project costs, the NPV for the project is estimated at about US$389 million, using&#13;
a discount rate of 12 percent. The ERR is estimated at 52 percent. These results are in&#13;
line with numerous ex post studies regarding the impact of agriculture research and&#13;
technology projects in Latin America and worldwide.&#13;
3.10        In addition to the overall project benefits estimation, the impact of&#13;
technology application on international trade has been measured. Trade would improve&#13;
significantly, considering that most commodities under the analysis can be exported.&#13;
Based on the consolidated results of MODEXC, it is estimated that the trade surplus for&#13;
these products could grow by 49 percent in the year 2000 and at the end of the project it&#13;
could more than triple.&#13;
3.11        Finally, sensitivity analysis has been carried out for the project to test the&#13;
impact of either overall income decreases or increases. As shown in Annex 4, by&#13;
decreasing benefits such that income resulting from the project fall by 20 percent, the&#13;
estimated internal rate of return would decline by eight percent. This represents a&#13;
reduction in the NPV of about US$95 million. Because of the relatively high NPV and&#13;
return benefits would have to fall by over 80 percent to obtain an NPV of zero. A&#13;
20 percent increase in overall costs yields similar NPV and IRR results. To obtain an&#13;
NPV of zero, costs would have to increase by nearly six times. While these results show&#13;
that project returns are sensitive to movements in overall benefits and costs, the returns&#13;
are high enough that a 20 percent unfavorable shift in either benefits or costs would not&#13;
produce negative overall results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
C. Project Objectives&#13;
3.12         The objective is to strengthen the national capacity to do agricultural&#13;
research, with an aim to increase agricultural productivity and output while preserving or&#13;
enhancing the natural resource base, by: (i) introducing a competitive research grant&#13;
program; (ii) developing Research and Education Exchange partnerships with intemational&#13;
science institutions; and (iii) strengthening the national agricultural research institute,&#13;
NIAP.&#13;
D. Project Description&#13;
A Diversfied, Interactive and Competitive System&#13;
3.13         To achieve the above objectives this project proposes to put in place a new&#13;
technology generation system for Ecuador. The project will create a research capacity&#13;
within the country that will result in a diversified, and interactive and sustainable research&#13;
system. Increasing or diversifying the number of suppliers of technology will by itself&#13;
bring more resources into the system and will provide a broader opportunity for private&#13;
funding sources to participate, thereby contributing to the sustainability of the system.&#13;
Through the competitive funding grants, opportunities will be provided for joint research&#13;
projects to be developed between research entities (research institutes, universities, NGOs&#13;
etc.), and the private sector. Giving the opportunity to farmers groups to cofinance such&#13;
projects will strengthen their ownership of the research system, along with their&#13;
participation on the executive council and their involvement in the discussions for priority&#13;
setting.&#13;
3.14         In the past, little has been done to encourage the integration of the three&#13;
main groups, INLAP, universities and farmers groups, that effectively make up the national&#13;
agricultural research system (NARS) in Ecuador. This all-inclusive concept of a NARS is&#13;
one of the underlying principles of this project. The project will incorporate the largest&#13;
number of research and interest groups as possible. This will help to assure that all&#13;
aspects of needed research can be covered and that the products will provide answers for&#13;
most relevant economic, social and environmental problems.&#13;
3.15         Another principle underlying this project is that of interaction. A modem&#13;
agricultural research system requires regular interaction among the various institutional&#13;
participants and scientists. Linkages between farmers and researchers need to be clearly&#13;
articulated, efficient and regular. Farmers must be able to communicate their concerns to&#13;
researchers quickly and systematically. Through participation in competitive funding&#13;
mechanisms farmers will be able to influence the research agenda. The various research&#13;
institutions must be able to affiliate with each other and work closely together in joint&#13;
research programs, when circumstances warrant. The project through special funding&#13;
mechanisms will develop these linkages and promote joint research programs between&#13;
institutions that will allow them to work together when their collective resources are&#13;
better able to resolve a problem than individual efforts (see Annex 4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
3.16         Another principle underlying this project is competition, which is a required&#13;
element for efficient production of new technical knowledge. The project will utilize the&#13;
concept of competition as the basis for allocating scarce research resources among&#13;
individual researchers and among research institutions. This will allow the system to be&#13;
more responsive to the needs of farmers and be more demand driven.&#13;
Research Priorities&#13;
3.17         Sectoral policy for agriculture in Ecuador encompasses the broad issues of&#13;
equity, efficiency, food security and natural resource conservation. When INIAP was&#13;
established in the mid-sixties its work program revolved around a set of priorities, which&#13;
were developed within the framework of national food self-sufficiency and thereby&#13;
concentrated on the basic food commodities. However, over the years the list of priorities&#13;
was added to indiscriminately through political pressure, and by researchers who set their&#13;
own research agenda.&#13;
3.18         In recent years, INIAP has sponsored in collaboration with ISNAR two&#13;
priority setting exercises to improve the objectivity of research resource allocation. For&#13;
the preparation of this project Fundacion IDEA used an economic surplus model&#13;
developed at CIAT (Colombia) to suggest research priorities. Although these three&#13;
studies resulted in somewhat different specific rankings of priorities there was a high level&#13;
of congruency between all studies when the top ten priorities were taken as a group. The&#13;
studies were also consistent in emphasizing that the most important commodities are those&#13;
from the coastal region. This reflects the change in agricultural production over the past&#13;
thirty years. These priorities have now been accepted by the MAG for funding under the&#13;
project (Annex 6). This exercise in priority setting should be regarded as an iterative&#13;
process of dialogue arnong all the interested parties; producers, Government, and research&#13;
organizations in order to have the flexibility to modify priorities as circumstances demand.&#13;
3.19         INIAP has used its priority setting exercises to establish a research&#13;
progran based on nine national, four regional programs and seven technical departments.&#13;
The nine national programs are: cattle and pastures, rice, corn, roots and tubers, coffee,&#13;
cacao, bananas and plantains, fruits, legumes and agroforestry. The four regional&#13;
programs are: Andean grains, soya, small grain cereals, and swine. The seven technical&#13;
departments are: soil and water, pest management, genetic resources, nutrition,&#13;
biometrics, economics and planning, and information.&#13;
3.20         Since the most important problems that have to be solved are of a practical&#13;
nature the research agenda to be financed under this project will concentrate on the&#13;
applied and adaptive end of the research spectrum. There will also be a strong orientation&#13;
towards products that make up the bulk of small farm production, such as plantains, rice,&#13;
potatoes, maize, coffee and cacao. Natural resource management research, i.e., soil and&#13;
water management, genetic resources, and pest management will also be funded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Research - Ejtension Linkages&#13;
3.21        This project is part of an overall Modernization of Agricultural Services&#13;
Program being developed by the Ministry of Agriculture which also includes Agricultural&#13;
Extension and Plant and Animal Health, both of which are being financed by IDB.&#13;
Although they are being financed separately, there are operational linkages between&#13;
research and extension which will be financed by the extension component. These&#13;
linkages include the direct contracting of extension services by commercial farmers from&#13;
research entities and the technical training of extension agents by research organizations.&#13;
Since much of the research funded under this project will be applied and adaptive and will&#13;
include "on-farmn" research, the research-extension linkages will be further strengthened.&#13;
E. Project Components&#13;
3.22        The following components have been included in the project:&#13;
(a) Competitive Grants which include research grants, research and educational exchange&#13;
partnerships with international institutions; (b) Strengthening INIAP; and (c) Project&#13;
Implementation. The indicated costs are base costs.&#13;
Competitive Grants&#13;
3.23        This component (US$15,000,000) is divided into two subcomponents:&#13;
(a)   Research Grants (US$7,500,000) will finance individual research&#13;
subprojects, on an open competitive basis with variable grant support, up&#13;
to a maximum level of 75 percent of total subproject cost, a maximum&#13;
subproject cost of US$100,000 each and a maximum life of three years.&#13;
Researchers from universities, NGOs, and INIAP wili be eligible to&#13;
compete for research support in priority areas as established by MAG.&#13;
Private sector researchers will be eligible in partnership with one of these&#13;
entities, and with appropriate matching support. This competitive grant&#13;
system is proposed as a mechanism for: (a) increasing the efficiency of&#13;
allocation of funds for agricultural research; (b) assuring the participation&#13;
of scientists in agricultural research from among the several institutional&#13;
participants; and (c) strengthening interactive linkages between public and&#13;
private sector entities. In the process of judging the scientific merit of any&#13;
proposal for grant support, the following criteria, among others, will have&#13;
to be met:&#13;
* relevance of the proposal to national research priorities;&#13;
* basic capacity of the researcher to do the proposed research, i.e., level&#13;
of experience, sound technical approach, and facilities to do the work;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
*  probability of successful outcome and intrinsic merit of the research,&#13;
i.e., will the results serve as the basis for improved technology or as a&#13;
solution for environmental problems that can be applied at the farm&#13;
level?; and&#13;
*  evidence that completing the research will strengthen capacity of the&#13;
proposer in the research area and stimulate further research, education&#13;
and development of manpower in agricultural sciences.&#13;
These subproject selection criteria, along with others, have been agreed&#13;
upon with the Bank and are included in the Operational Manual&#13;
(para. 4.11).&#13;
(b)   Research and Education Exchange Partnerships with International&#13;
Institutions (US$7,500,000) will finance on a competitive basis, the&#13;
formation of Research and Education Exchange partnerships between&#13;
research agencies, universities, key NGOs, and international science&#13;
institutions to facilitate the importation of applicable technology, to&#13;
strengthen the research capacity of Ecuadoran research institutions and to&#13;
strengthen graduate education programs in Ecuadoran universities.&#13;
Competitive grants of up to 50 percent for research and 100 percent for&#13;
scholarships will be awarded to selected participants. Each will be given in&#13;
high priority research areas. Grant funds will be used for joint research&#13;
programs, fellowships, short-term technical assistance, and personnel&#13;
exchanges. Appropriate criteria for awarding these grants will be part of&#13;
the OM (para. 4.11) and will include: the critical nature of the area of&#13;
research; potential contribution to strengthening the national research&#13;
capacity; and the sustainability of the relationship. It will also finance, on a&#13;
competitive basis, the strengthening of graduate teaching and research&#13;
programs based on partnerships with foreign universities as well as high&#13;
priority short-term training. In this way it will build on an important array&#13;
of individual faculty capacity scattered throughout the university/NGO&#13;
system.&#13;
Strengthening INALP&#13;
3.24         This component (US$6,500,000) will strengthen INIAP in the following&#13;
areas:&#13;
(a)   Development Plan (US$100,000). This plan which will be completed&#13;
within the first year of the project and will address the long term&#13;
sustainability of INIAP. The plan will include inter alia: the development&#13;
of a personnel policy; the assignment of personnel in compliance with the&#13;
research priorities to be financed; asset restructuring; role and management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
of the endowment fund; and a financial plan. The Development Plan will&#13;
be used as a basis to develop monitorable indicators for use in the&#13;
Implementation Agreement to be signed by MAG and INIAP for the&#13;
execution of the MNIAP component. The signing of the Implementation&#13;
Agreement will be a condition of disbursement for the other&#13;
subcomponents that follow.&#13;
(b)   Training for Advanced Degrees (US$2,000,000). Fellowship Grants for&#13;
advanced degree training and short-term training will be provided in high&#13;
priority areas. Dissertation or thesis research will be done in Ecuador, as&#13;
part of INIAPs on-going research program. The scholarships will cover&#13;
the costs of tuition, living expenses, and travel.&#13;
(c)   Ecuadoran Scientists as Long-term Consultants (US$2,900,000). The&#13;
project will finance about 22 Ecuadoran research scientists (10 Ph.Ds and&#13;
12 Masters) at local consulting salaries. This will jump-start the research&#13;
program of INIAP that is now depleted of qualified personnel and will put&#13;
in place effective research programs into which Ph.D. and Master students&#13;
can return. These consultafits will be hired for priority research areas only.&#13;
While they will be employed for the duration of the project, the successful&#13;
implementation of INLAPs Development Plan should ensure that these&#13;
consultants can be maintained as staff by INIAP once the project&#13;
terminates.&#13;
(d)   International Senior Agricultural Scientists (US$300,000). About&#13;
25 man/months of short-term support from senior agricultural scientists&#13;
and their institutions will be provided in critical research areas and for&#13;
research administration. Such scientists will be from leading research&#13;
institutions and their home research institution will provide the advisor on a&#13;
cost reimbursable basis. These advisors will be senior researchers with&#13;
experience in research funding and administration, as well as current&#13;
credentials in research. The institutional linkage will facilitate the further&#13;
integration of international researchers into Ecuador nascent agricultural&#13;
science system, and from the international science network more generally.&#13;
(e)   Equipment, Vehicles, Rehabilitation of Laboratories, and Libraries&#13;
(US$1,200,000). In terms of physical plant, INIAPs highest priority is for&#13;
rehabilitating and modernizing the research stations, including electricity&#13;
and water supply. The subcomponent will finance: the rehabilitation of the&#13;
existing facilities - civil works (US$700,000) and vehicles and equipment&#13;
(US$500,000), including laboratory equipment, vehicles and farm&#13;
machinery, library materials and equipment including software and&#13;
hardware to support an information system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
Project Implementation Unit&#13;
3.25        The overall implementation of the project (US$3,300,000), will be the&#13;
responsibility of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) which has been established by&#13;
MAG. It will contract the technical aspects, such as the evaluation and selection of the&#13;
Competitive Grants, to a NGO with expertise in this area.&#13;
3.26        The PIU will administer and promote the project and will be the main&#13;
contact for the Bank for project implementation. The PIU will prepare an Annual Work&#13;
Plan, including budget, for all work under its supervision, along with annual financial&#13;
statements. This subcomponent will finance technical assistance, vehicles and equipment,&#13;
contracted staff salaries, office supplies and overhead.&#13;
3.27        Technical assistance will include the implementation of a supervision,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation system for investments in Research and Education Exchange&#13;
partnership subprojects. It will also include the promotion and training of participating&#13;
entities in preparing proposals for grant funding consideration; the preparation of a project&#13;
performance report to be used as a basis for a comprehensive midterm review; the end-&#13;
evaluation of the project which will assess, inter alia, the impact of the project and&#13;
xletermine if the Government should prepare a follow-up project; and other technical&#13;
assistance, including training, to support the implementation of the project.&#13;
3.28        The management of the competitive components of the project will be&#13;
awarded under a single contract to a NGO (US$2,100,000). The NGO will be responsible&#13;
for the review, selection and administration of the Research subprojects and the Research&#13;
and Education Exchange Partnerships. The NGO will: invite proposals; review the&#13;
technical and financial aspects of the proposals; through a Peer Review Panel, select&#13;
subprojects; draft cofinancing contracts for the approved subprojects; and supervise&#13;
subproject implementation. Under this subcomponent, the project will finance a service&#13;
contract that will include technical assistance, the Peer Review Panel, consultant salaries,&#13;
office supplies and overheads, including the management fee.&#13;
Status of Project Preparation: Project Year One&#13;
3.29        INIAP is preparing the terms of reference for the preparation of its&#13;
Development Plan and will have selected the consultants by May 31, 1996. An invitation&#13;
for research proposals, will be sent out, and proposals will be reviewed by&#13;
October 1, 1996. MAG will prepare the Annual Work Plan including Budget for 1997 by&#13;
October 31, 1996. Students for graduate training will be selected by October 31, 1996.&#13;
MAG will prepare the TORs for the implementation of the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
system along with those for the promotion and training for the project by October 31,&#13;
1996 and will have selected the respective consultants by November 30, 1996. For the&#13;
NGO contract to manage the technical aspects of the program, MAG has sent to the&#13;
Bank a draft consultants contract and will select the NGO by September 30, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
Project Costs and Financing&#13;
3.30        The estimated total project cost is US$27 million, including US$2.2 million&#13;
for contingencies (as detailed in Annex 1). Costs were calculated using January 1996&#13;
prices and include a physical contingency of five percent on institutional strengthening&#13;
components. Expected price increases over the financing period were calculated using&#13;
Bank current projections for international inflation.&#13;
3.31        The Republic of Ecuador will be the Borrower. It was agreed at&#13;
negotiations that the financial terms be modified so that the loan be a US dollar loan at the&#13;
standard interest rate for LIBOR based US dollar, single currency loans. It was also&#13;
agreed that the amortization terms for this loan benefit from the decision to finance the&#13;
Environment TA loan on fixed-rate US dollar loan terms. The shorter maturity for that&#13;
loan (13 years) enables this loan to be financed with a 21-year maturity, including seven&#13;
years grace, somewhat longer than standard country terms for Ecuador of 20 years,&#13;
including five years grace. The Government of Ecuador has requested a LIBOR-based&#13;
US dollar single currency loan in the context of its external debt management strategy.&#13;
Ecuador's net trade position is largely US dollar denominated, and Ecuador would like to&#13;
increase the share of US dollars in its overall liability portfolio to reduce its currency risk.&#13;
It has selected the LIBOR-based interest rate in order to better tailor the repayment terms&#13;
of this loan. The Government is aware of the resulting interest rate risk it is taking, since&#13;
most of its external commercial debt is also indexed to LIBOR. The Government will&#13;
make the loan available to MAG to finance project components. MAG will cofinance,&#13;
with participating entities, the Competitive Research Grant Program and the Research and&#13;
Education Exchange Partnerships. MAG will also finance the strengthening of INIAP;&#13;
and the management and administration of the project.&#13;
3.32        The project will be financed by a Bank loan of US$21 million (78 percent&#13;
of total project cost), including US$1 million in retroactive financing. This will cover&#13;
100 percent of the estimated foreign exchange costs and 68 percent of the local costs.&#13;
The balance of project costs will be financed by Government (US$3.1 million, or&#13;
11.5 percent), and by participating research groups, i.e., universities, farmer groups and&#13;
NGOs, (US$2.9 million, or 10.7 percent). MAG will finance all Competitive Grants&#13;
including Partnerships, at an average of 65 percent of total subproject costs, financing at&#13;
75 percent for the first US$4.5 million, 65 percent for the next US$4.5 million and&#13;
55 percent thereafter (para 5.1 (c) (iii)). Adequate funding will be made available to the&#13;
project, by allocating funds in the annual budget for the following year according to the&#13;
proposals to be submitted to the Bank no later than October 31 of each year following the&#13;
requirements specified in the projects Annual Work Plans (para. 5.1 (c) (i)). The&#13;
Government will provide adequate working capital to the PIU by depositing, in advance,&#13;
in the PIU account its share of the equivalent of one month's operating expenses&#13;
(para 5.1 (c) (ii)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.33        Procurement of goods, works and contracting services financed by the&#13;
Bank under the project will follow procedures acceptable to the Bank (Guidelines&#13;
Procurement under Bank Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995). As applicable, standard&#13;
bidding documents for National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will be agreed upon and&#13;
incorporated into the Operational Manual, to be used by the implementing agencies as the&#13;
basis for procurement under the project.&#13;
3.34        Civil Works contracts costing more than US$100,000, up to an aggregate&#13;
of US$500,000, will be awarded based on NCB procedures. Minor works estimated to&#13;
cost less than US$100,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$250,000 will be procured&#13;
under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from&#13;
three qualified contractors in response to a written invitation.&#13;
3.35        Vehicles and laboratory equipment will be packaged into contracts greater&#13;
than US$50,000 and will be procured under Limited International Bidding (LLB) from&#13;
suppliers with service and maintenance facilities in Ecuador. Other goods, and equipment&#13;
valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent per order, will be purchased on the basis of price&#13;
quotations from at least three eligible suppliers up to an aggregate of US$400,000.&#13;
3.36        The selection and appointment of consultants for studies and technical&#13;
assistance under the project will be consistent with the August 1981 Bank Guidelines for&#13;
the Use of Consultants by Bank Borrowers and by the Bank as Executing Agency, using&#13;
Bank issued standard forms of contract and standard letters of invitation acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
3.37        Under Research Grants and Partnerships procurement of goods (fertilizers,&#13;
chemicals, etc.) and equipment (laboratoratory equipment, field implements, etc.) will be&#13;
done under shopping, due to the small size of grants. Procurement of fellowships will be&#13;
done by direct contract, because of the specific nature of each fellowship. The contract&#13;
for each grant will state that procurement will follow procedures acceptable to the Bank&#13;
and a sample contract will be included in the Operational Manual. A procurement&#13;
specialist on the staff of the PIU will review procurement under the project to ensure that&#13;
the conditions described are met. During supervision missions, the Bank will sample&#13;
contracts for review of how procurement was being implemented&#13;
3.38        Prior Review. The Bank will review all contracts for goods, equipment,&#13;
civil works and consultants over US$50,000. Approximately 15 percent of all&#13;
procurement will be subject to prior review by the Bank. This low percentage is&#13;
acceptable due to the fact that most procurement will be made by the grantees under small&#13;
grants. As a safeguard against such low levels of prior review, the staff of the PIU will&#13;
include a procurement specialist who will review all procurement not under prior review&#13;
by the Bank, in accordance with the Operational Manual. As for NCB procurement there&#13;
will be no prior registration of bidders, no requirement for local agents, and no provision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
expenses including travel and maintenance and overhead expenses of the PIU will be&#13;
reimbursed from the loan at a rate of 85 percent of costs up to a loan disbursement of&#13;
US$225,000, 70 percent thereafter up to US$360,000, and 50 percent thereafter until&#13;
project completion. The Bank will reimburse 100 percent of the Governments share of the&#13;
Competitive Research Grants and Research and Education Exchange Partnerships up to a&#13;
maximum of 75 percent of the total investment cost of each subproject.&#13;
3.41          All disbursements from the loan, except for equipment and materials are&#13;
expected to be made against statements of expenditures (SOEs). All contracts, including&#13;
consultants, greater than US$50,000 or more equivalent, will not be eligible for SOEs. All&#13;
expenditures under research grants, fellowships, training, incremental operating costs and&#13;
contracts not requiring prior review will be disbursed under SOEs. The participating&#13;
entities responsible for the procurement of goods and contracting services will maintain&#13;
the SOE. The minimum value of each disbursement request will be US$120,000 during&#13;
the initial period of the project, and US$200,000 when cumulative disbursements from the&#13;
loan have reached US$4.4 million. Retroactive financing of up to US$1 million for&#13;
eligible expenditures made after May 31, 1995, but no more than 12 months before&#13;
signing, will be provided for under the loan. The project is expected to be completed by&#13;
June 30, 2003, with a closing date of December 31, 2003.&#13;
3.42          The Borrower will establish a Special Account in the Central Bank of&#13;
Ecuador, or a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank to cover eligible project&#13;
expenditures under the loan. The Bank will initially deposit up to US$0.6 million upon&#13;
receipt of an initial withdrawal application. This could later be increased to&#13;
US$1.0 million (representing the average expected loan disbursement for a four-month&#13;
period) once cumulative disbursements from the loan reached US$4.4 million. Subsequent&#13;
replenishment by the Bank into the Special Account will follow the procedures for which&#13;
Bank funds are disbursed against actual expenditures.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
Accounfing and Audifing&#13;
3.43        The PIU will establish consolidated project accounts and maintain other&#13;
records as needed, including separate accounts and records of the total cost of financed&#13;
subprojects and the cost of individual project activities. Contracts with participating&#13;
entities will include accounting and auditing requirements as provided for in the&#13;
Operational Manual.&#13;
3.44        Project accounts, the Special Account, and related financial information&#13;
(including supporting documentation for the SOEs) will be audited annually by an&#13;
independent private auditor acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with Bank auditing&#13;
guidelines. Certified copies of the audited consolidated project accounts and audited&#13;
Special Account in the Central Bank (including a separate opinion on the use of SOEs)&#13;
will be submitted annually to the Bank not later than six months after the close of the&#13;
financial year (para. 5.1 (c) (v)). As part of the Operational Manual, the contracts with&#13;
the participating entities will include a condition that, if the financial audits identify&#13;
significant irregularities in any participating entity, the PIU will take the necessary steps to&#13;
suspend the contract.&#13;
4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
4.1         An Executive Council, chaired by the Technical Subsecretary, has been&#13;
formed within MAG, with responsibility to oversee the project. A Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PIU) has also been established by MAG, which will be responsible for reporting to&#13;
the Bank and managing the INIAP Institutional Strengthening component. This PIU will&#13;
contract out the management of the Competitive Grants to a NGO and this contract will&#13;
be financed by this project. The NGO will be responsible for handling all technical and&#13;
pre-contractual aspects of the project and will be supported by a Peer Review Panel which&#13;
will review all proposals for the Competitive Grants component of the project (see&#13;
Organization Chart - Annex 2). The NGO will send out an invitation for proposals to be&#13;
financed, competitively, based on priorities established by the Executive Council and&#13;
approved by MAG. The annual budget for the project which will also be established by&#13;
the Executive Council and approved by MAG will determiine the size of the program for&#13;
any one year.&#13;
Executive Council&#13;
4.2         The Council will be led by the Technical Subsecretary in the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture and will include representatives of the private sector, universities, foundations,&#13;
and NGOs. The function of the Council is: to oversee the implementation of the project;&#13;
to approve Annual Work Plans including budget; to ensure that the PIU and INIAP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
comply with the obligations stated in their Annual Work Plans; and to ensure that&#13;
proposals conform to national research priorities as established by MAG.&#13;
The Project Implementation Unit&#13;
4.3         The PIU, which has been established by a Ministerial Resolution, will be&#13;
responsible for preparing the budget, annual work plans, making payments from the loan&#13;
account for project expenditures, and preparing financial and progress reports for the&#13;
project and will be the main contact for the Bank for project implementation. The PIU&#13;
will also contract consultants to: (a) implement a M&amp;E system; (b) prepare an evaluation&#13;
report for the Midterm Review; and (c) prepare an End Evaluation of the project. It will&#13;
contract staff to promote the project and provide training to participating entities in&#13;
preparing proposals for grant funding, and it will manage the contract for the management&#13;
of the Competitive Grants.&#13;
4.4         The PIU will have about seven staff, including support staff, led by a&#13;
Director, who will report to the Executive Council and the Technical Subsecretary in&#13;
MAG. The Director will have overall responsibility for the administration of the project.&#13;
He will be supported by a Finance and Administration Manager who will handle payments&#13;
from the loan account for project expenditures (contracted payments for research,&#13;
exchange partnerships and fellowship grants, technical assistance, equipment, vehicles,&#13;
civil works, and materials procured under the project). He will also prepare the annual&#13;
budget, consolidate project cost statements and arrange for the audit of the projects cost&#13;
statements and Special Account. There will also be a Procurement and Contracts&#13;
Specialist who will ensure that all technical assistance contracts and the procurement of&#13;
goods, equipment and vehicles, and civil works financed under the project, directly or&#13;
through the Competitive Grants, are done in accordance with procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Government and the Bank. There will also be a Monitoring and Evaluation Manager and&#13;
an assistant to monitor and evaluate project implementation.&#13;
4.5         As a condition of effectiveness the Project Director will have been hired&#13;
and the PIU will have the minimum staff in place, in numbers and with qualifications&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, to initiate the project (para. 5.1 (a) (i)). Government will, at all&#13;
times, retain in the PIU staff in numbers and composition, including the position of&#13;
director, satisfactory to the Bank for efficient implementation of the project, (para. 5.1 (c)&#13;
(vi)).&#13;
Management of the Competitive Grants&#13;
4.6         The management of the Competitive Grants will be contracted out to an&#13;
NGO. The NGO will promote these grants by organizing training workshops on the&#13;
preparation of proposals for competitive selection, send out annual invitations for&#13;
proposals; conduct a preliminary technical and financial review of proposals before passing&#13;
them onto the Peer Review Panel for final approval; draft contracts for the approved&#13;
subprojects with the selected implementing agencies; and supervise subproject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
implementation. Service contracts for the execution of subprojects will be signed by the&#13;
PIU.&#13;
4.7         For fellowships that will be awarded under the project the NGO will:&#13;
screen proposals for compliance before passing them on to the Peer Review Panel; prepare&#13;
financing agreements with the selected participants; assist the awardee and those selected&#13;
from INIAP for fellowships in applying to graduate schools; monitor and supervise the&#13;
awardees progress; and arrange for students to return to Ecuador to do their thesis work&#13;
on appropriate topics in INIAP, university or private sector laboratories. It will also&#13;
advise the PIU on the payments to be made under the component. A draft contract,&#13;
between MAG and the NGO, for the management of the Competitive Grants has been&#13;
prepared. It will be a condition of effectiveness that the NGO has been selected and a&#13;
Letter of Intent signed (para. 5.1 (a) (ii)).&#13;
4.8         Under the project there is a Strengthening component for INIAP. This will&#13;
be in the form of technical assistance to prepare a Development Plan, fellowships, research&#13;
consultants, civil works to rehabilitate existing facilities, vehicles, equipment and materials.&#13;
INIAP will prepare all of the necessary pre-contractual documentation and pass this on to&#13;
the PIU and the NGO, where appropriate, for processing. All payments will be made by&#13;
the PIU. INIAP would agree through an Implementation Agreement with MAG to meet&#13;
certain requirements which would include the preparation of a Development Plan that&#13;
would deal with the assignment of personnel; the separation of production and research&#13;
activities; asset restructuring; and the role and management of the Endowment Fund. It&#13;
will be a condition of disbursement of the INIAP component that the Implementation&#13;
Agreement with INIAP would be signed (para. 5.1 (b) (i)).&#13;
Peer Review Panel&#13;
4.9         A Peer Review Panel (five members) will be contracted through the NGO,&#13;
to review, and select: the Research Grants and the Research and Education Exchange&#13;
partnership subprojects to be financed under the project. The Panel will present the&#13;
selected proposals to the contracted NGO for financing. Panel members will be&#13;
contracted at a standard daily rate for about thirty days per year. Contracts will be for&#13;
two years. The Peer Review Panel will consist of scientists with a proven record in&#13;
research and will come from the various research entities, including the private sector.&#13;
International participation will be needed in certain instances. There will be an&#13;
environmental specialist on the Peer Review Panel who will review proposals for their&#13;
environmental impact. The qualifications and terms of service for all panel members will&#13;
be included in the OM, and MAG will ensure that the Peer Review Panel will be&#13;
maintained with members satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
Operational Manual&#13;
4.10        An Operational Manual (OM), will be a working document for the project,&#13;
describing how to plan, identify, prepare, select, contract, finance, supervise, evaluate, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
account for the proposals to be financed with participating entities under the project. It&#13;
will be a condition of loan effectiveness that the OM has been adopted by MAG, through a&#13;
Ministerial Resolution (para. 5.1 (a) (iii)), and MAG will implement the project as per the&#13;
agreed OM and that the Government will send to the Bank for approval, any proposed&#13;
changes to the OM (para. 5.1 (c) (vii)).&#13;
Processing Proposals for Competitive Research Grants, and Research and&#13;
Education Exchange Partnerships&#13;
4.11        The system for the identification, processing and approval of proposals for&#13;
financing is based on open competition for funds, based on research priorities set by MAG&#13;
and selection criteria developed in the Operational Manual. Entities eligible to compete&#13;
will be INIAP, universities, growers associations and other private sector entities.&#13;
4.12        The PIU will send letters each year to participating and prospective entities&#13;
inviting proposals for the various competitive subcomponents of the project. This&#13;
invitation letter will state basic criteria for proposals, in accordance with the OM, as well&#13;
as the projects investment priorities for that year. The contracted NGO will enter&#13;
proposals received into a database and eliminate duplicates, technically unacceptable&#13;
proposals, those that do not meet environmental standards, and those that did not address&#13;
the main objectives of the project. The final list will be sent on for final review to the Peer&#13;
Review Panel.&#13;
4.13        The Peer Review Panel will review and select the proposals on a technical&#13;
basis and criteria established in the Operational Manual and within the annual budget&#13;
allocations. They will then inform the PIU as to their final selections along with the&#13;
reasons for such a selection. For the proposals that are accepted, the PIU will notify the&#13;
implementing agencies as to the acceptance of the proposal and the amount of financing.&#13;
For each approved subproject, the contracted NGO will prepare draft financing contracts&#13;
between the PIU and the participating entity. Once Government budgetary contributions&#13;
were secured, the PIU will sign contracts with participating entities and make payments&#13;
according to the schedule set forth in the contract. Letters will also be sent out indicating&#13;
which proposals were not selected and the reasons for such action.&#13;
4.14        The PIU will prepare an Annual Work Plan, including budget, for the&#13;
project in accordance with normal Government timing and procedures. The PIU will send&#13;
to the Bank for review, by June 30 of each year, the proposed Annual Work Plan,&#13;
including budget, to be undertaken by the PIU under the project for the coming year&#13;
(para. 5.1 (c) (viii)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.15        In order to ensure adequate monitoring and supervision, the PIU will&#13;
appoint consultants not later than three months from the date of effectiveness, under terms&#13;
of reference (included in the OM), satisfactory to the Bank, to implement a monitoring&#13;
and evaluation system for the project and send a report to the Bank for comment within&#13;
six months from the effectiveness date (para. 5.1 (c) (ix)).&#13;
4.16        The PIU will submit an annual progress report to the Bank (due&#13;
February 28 of each year) and a short progress report, (due August 31 of each year),&#13;
identifying the major issues, problems and actions taken in the planning and&#13;
implementation of the project (para. 5.1 (c) (x)). These reports will include the status of&#13;
each component and discuss any problems that might arise which could affect&#13;
implementation. This information will also help the Bank and the PIU to plan the timing&#13;
and composition of supervision missions.&#13;
4.17        Midterm Review. To evaluate the project, the PIU will hire consultants,&#13;
no later than 24 months from the date of effectiveness, under terms of reference&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, to prepare a midterm performance report. No later than 30&#13;
months after the effectiveness date, and using the above report as a basis, the Borrower&#13;
will undertake jointly with the Bank, a Midterm review and evaluation of the activities&#13;
carried out under the project and the results achieved. This review will include but not be&#13;
limited to: (a) the Executive Council, the PIU, the management contract for the&#13;
Competitive Grants, and the Peer Review Panel; (b) all aspects of the implementation of&#13;
approved proposals, particularly the selection process and the response of the private&#13;
sector and universities; and (c) the effectiveness of the provisions of the Operational&#13;
Manual and its application. Consultants satisfactory to the Bank will be hired, no later than&#13;
24 months after effectiveness, to prepare a midterm project performance report and the&#13;
midterm review will take place no later than 30 months after the date of effectiveness.&#13;
Once the review has been completed all required adjustments, including changes to the&#13;
Operational Manual agreeable to the Bank, would be introduced (para. 5.1 (c) (xi)).&#13;
4.18        End Evaluation. Consultants will be hired by June 30, 2000, to assess the&#13;
overall success of the project and to determine whether and when a follow-up project will&#13;
be needed. The consultants will assess the projects success in developing and integrating&#13;
links across the research spectrum from basic to adaptive research, and in promoting an&#13;
integrated, interactive and competitive research system that involves the public sector,&#13;
farmers groups, universities and other private sector entities (para. 5.1 (c) (xii)).&#13;
4.19        The Borrower, through MAG, will prepare and furnish to the Bank, no&#13;
later than six months after the close of the project, a plan for the future operation of the&#13;
project. The Borrower has also agreed to give the Bank a reasonable opportunity to&#13;
exchange views with the Borrower on such a plan and thereafter carry out the plan, taking&#13;
into account the Banks comments (para. 5.1 (c) (xiii)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
4.20        Benefits will accrue to the agricultural research system, by making it more&#13;
competitive; by involving a broader range of institutions; by attracting more funding from&#13;
the private sector and therefore leading to greater sustainability; by developing exchange&#13;
partnerships and therefore facilitating the importation of technology, and strengthening of&#13;
graduate teaching in universities. The project will also develop a critical mass of scientists&#13;
capable of doing research.&#13;
4.21        Beneficiaries will be farmers, the majority of whom are poor, and who&#13;
produce the basic food commodities, such as rice, maize, potatoes and plantains along&#13;
with those that produce export crops such as bananas and plantains. Technologies&#13;
developed under this project will improve management of soil and water, increase disease&#13;
and pest resistance of crops which will result in reduced pesticide use, develop integrated&#13;
pest management methods and soil conservation methods, and produce higher yielding&#13;
crop varieties.&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
4.22         General risks to this type of project are lack of Government commitment,&#13;
inability to set priorities and maintain them, lack of counterpart funding, uncertainty of&#13;
private sector participation and the lack of good working conditions for returning M.S.&#13;
and Ph.D. fellows. The project will address the commitment risk by eliciting a statement&#13;
of the Governments agricultural technology strategy in which it provides assurances of the&#13;
priority it gives to public funding of agricultural research. The project will set as a&#13;
condition of effectiveness the setting of priorities by the MAG in conjunction with&#13;
producers and research organizations. In terms of sustainability of funding, an analysis of&#13;
future needs has been made during project preparation, the results of which have been&#13;
presented to MAG for discussion and will be used as the basis for eliciting sustained&#13;
support in the future. The preparation of a Development Plan by iNLAP which will&#13;
address such issues as asset restructuring and the management of its endowment fund will&#13;
improve the sustainability of that institution. This analysis also includes investments from&#13;
the private sector. To support the MAG in managing the Competitive Grants component&#13;
of the project a NGO will be contracted. INIAP's autonomy along with access to&#13;
competitive funds should better employment conditions for higher level staff.&#13;
Environmental Impact&#13;
4.23        The direct and immediate environmental impacts of agriculture can be&#13;
grouped into four categories: (a) loss of habitat; (b) loss of soil productivity; (c) modified&#13;
hydrology; and (d) soil and water contamination. On the whole this project should have&#13;
beneficial environmental impacts. Encroachment by farmers and ranchers on frontier&#13;
tropical forests and other natural habitats should diminish as: (i) yields increase on&#13;
productive lands; and (ii) generation of technology enhances Ecuador's ability to deal with&#13;
environmental issues such as land degradation and agricultural chemical pollution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
4.24        Research programs financed by the project will; improve management of&#13;
sods and water, increase disease and pest resistance of crops and thereby reduce chemical&#13;
use, develop integrated pest management methods that will include more rational use of&#13;
pesticides, and develop soil conservation methods. As one of the main objectives of the&#13;
project is to increase the productivity of agriculture this should result in less pressure&#13;
being put on land and water resources. Research on animals and pasture should also&#13;
produce environmental benefits. Since much of the recent expansion on the coast has&#13;
been for pastures for animal production, more efficient use of pasture will decrease the&#13;
pressure on fragile tropical lands.&#13;
4.25        Specifically the project would have an environmental assessment (EA)&#13;
specialist on the Peer Review Panel of the project to screen research proposals. The&#13;
Operational Manual would include environmental criteria for the selection of research&#13;
projects under the competitive grants component.&#13;
Poverty Alleviation&#13;
4.26        While it is not a direct poverty intervention it has important implications for&#13;
rural poverty as the research priorities, i.e., rice, potatoes, maize, etc., being financed&#13;
under the project are of importance to small farmers as illustrated in the recent Poverty&#13;
Report (June 30, 1995). Rural poverty is tightly linked to the productivity of agriculture&#13;
and environmental degradation. This project will strengthen the knowledge base of&#13;
Ecuadoran agriculture and thereby increase productivity. Such productivity increases will&#13;
lead to more efficient growth, increase economic opportunities in rural areas, and halt the&#13;
deterioration of the natural resource base. The project will benefit farmers, most of whom&#13;
are poor. Through research on basic commodities such as rice, barley, plantains, and&#13;
potatoes, which make up the bulk of the calories consumed by the poor, poor consumers&#13;
will also benefit.&#13;

Investments in Agricultural Research&#13;
1.           Rates of Retum Around the World. Expenditures on agricultural research&#13;
consistently have been an excellent investment for a wide variety of governments and countries&#13;
around the world. Evenson, Waggoner and Ruttan6 reviewed 34 studies of returns to such&#13;
investments in various developed and developing countries and reported that returns ranged&#13;
from 20 to 110 percent per year. A similar review of 10 studies in South America found&#13;
returs ranging from 11 to 119 percent (Scobie)7. These high rates of return have helped these&#13;
countries to experience more rapid economic growth and development relative to countries&#13;
which discriminated against agriculture.&#13;
2.            These returns, which cover many years of investment, are comparable to the&#13;
rates of return received by a private investor on a certificate of deposit, savings account or&#13;
other investment instrument. They are extraordinarily high by any standard and suggest that&#13;
even developed countries still are substantially underinvested in agricultural research.&#13;
3.           Returns in Ecuador. Ecuador also has experienced success in its efforts to&#13;
generate, access and diffuse improved technologies, even though average yields still are&#13;
relatively low. Posada Torrese found a benefit-cost ratio of 2.46 for expenditures on&#13;
agricultural research in Ecuador between 1971 and 1981. Joint research on rice by INAP,&#13;
universities and international agencies resulted in returns of 34 percent between 1970 and 1990&#13;
(Palomino and Echeverria)9. A series of related studies carried out by INHZP with support&#13;
from ISNAR and FUNDAGRO revealed the following rates of return to research investments:&#13;
hard corn, 70 percent; african palm, 32 percent; potatoes, 33 percent; soybeans, 17 percent;&#13;
and wheat, 29 percent (INLAP)10.&#13;

4.            Thus, Ecuador science base has made a modest contribution to agricultural&#13;
development. It is interesting to speculate how much larger the contribution might have been&#13;
with a more neutral macroeconomic policy matrix and if the funding constraints discussed&#13;
below had been addressed on a sustained basis.&#13;
5.           Standards for Funding Levels. ISNAR and the World Bank recommend as&#13;
a standard that between one and two percent of the gross domestic product of agriculture&#13;
(AGDP) be expended on agricultural research (ISNAR and IICA p.45)11. A separate source&#13;
indicates that two percent has become the accepted target (ISNAR)"2. Expending one to two&#13;
percent of AGDP on agricultural research is the necessary investment range for building a&#13;
viable science base for agriculture on the basis of experience in developed and developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
6.           Perspective on Ecuador's Investment History. Investments in agricultural&#13;
research in NIAP and the universities declined steadily in real terms at three percent per year&#13;
between 1974-76 and 1991-93 ". Research expenditures as a share of AGDP also declined&#13;
steadily after 1975 and were only .25 percent in 1993 compared to a high of .85 percent in&#13;
1975. The rapid erosion of investments during the last two decades is in sharp contrast to the&#13;
period 1965-1975 when funding increased at 14.5 percent per year.&#13;
7.           The situation is not quite so dismal when one considers that the private sector&#13;
also engages in agricultural research and it is evident that its investment has increased as&#13;
Government support has eroded. It is now estimated that private sector investments are about&#13;
US$3.1 million'4. Based on these estimations the total research investment (public and private)&#13;
in 1993 would be US$7.4 million or .43 percent of AGDP. Nevertheless, the trend in&#13;
agricultural research investments as a share of AGDP still would have declined from the high in&#13;
1975.&#13;
8.           Even with private sector research, Ecuador has made very limited investments&#13;
in comparison to the rest of the developing world. Data for 52 developing countries showed&#13;
an average investment in agricultural research of .94 percent of AGDP during 1980-1985, up&#13;
from .69 percent during 1970-1979 (ISNAR and ilCA p. 47). Thus, Ecuador sharply reduced&#13;
its investments in agricultural research while most of its competitors were increasing their&#13;
investments.&#13;

Ecuador in Comparison with Regional Trading Partners&#13;
9.           Share of AGDP Invested in Sectoral Research. Ecuador compares quite&#13;
poorly with its regional trading partners in terms of investments in agricultural research.&#13;
According to internal IDB project documents, in 1993 Peru invested close to one percent of its&#13;
AGDP in agricultural research (not including private sector investments) or 4.0 times more&#13;
than Ecuador. Colombia also invested more than Ecuador at .5 percent of its AGDP in 1991,&#13;
and historically has invested much more. These bordering countries are Ecuador most&#13;
important competitors in the Andean Pact, both for lucrative export markets in the U.S. and&#13;
Europe, and for provision of food and fiber supplies in the region. The fact that Peru and&#13;
Colombia are investing so much more in agricultural research puts significant pressure on&#13;
Ecuador to increase its investments and reform its research system.&#13;
10.          The case of Spains response to its integration into the European Common&#13;
market in 1986 is instructive. Spain invested only about .5 percent of AGDP in agricultural&#13;
research in 1978. By 1988 it had increased this to nearly 1.5 percent and had substantially&#13;
reformed its agricultural research system (Herruzo and Echeverria)'5 as it was forced to&#13;
become more productive in order to compete in the Common Market.&#13;
11.          Yields of Principal Crops. The failure to invest more in agricultural research&#13;
is reflected in relatively low yields in Ecuador compared to its neighbors (Annex Table 3). The&#13;
strong correlation between the levels of investment in research cited above, and yields suggests&#13;
a clear lesson for Ecuador. If it is to compete with its neighbors it must increase investments in&#13;
research and agricultural productivity.&#13;
12.          The Emerging World Economy and the Need to Compete. Ecuador faces&#13;
a looming productivity crisis of major proportions. The low levels of yields relative to its&#13;
regional and hemispheric trading partners places the country at a major disadvantage. When&#13;
one considers the extent of the disparity in the context of the emerging global economy and&#13;
significant new market opportunities, it underscores the urgency with which Ecuador must deal&#13;
with its productivity crisis.&#13;
13.          Ecuador clung to its inward-oriented macroeconomic policy matrix for a&#13;
decade or more after most of its neighbors began to open their economies. Now the&#13;
accelerating pace of regional, hemispheric and global economic integration is forcing the&#13;
country to play catch-up in an increasingly competitive environment. NAFTA, the Andean&#13;
Pact, and MercoSur are harbingers of ever more rapid, comprehensive and expanding free&#13;
trade and economic integration during the next few years. This presages a complete&#13;
realignment in production and trading patterns as private investors focus on those goods and&#13;
services which they can produce most efficiently for a global economy.&#13;

37&#13;
14.          Ecuador moribund research system for agriculture and its relatively low levels&#13;
of productivity can only be described as one of the most serious problems facing the nation.&#13;
The country is in an extremely precarious situation which is getting worse, as research&#13;
investments lag far behind its competitors. The Government must act decisively and soon with&#13;
substantial infusions of resources, especially human capital, if the country is to take advantage&#13;
of emerging new markets for products it produces. Even with such actions, the long gestation&#13;
period for agricultural research means that some opportunities are lost forever. But failure to&#13;
act will relegate the economy to even lower growth rates and eventual stagnation when&#13;
petroleum reserves are exhausted.&#13;
ILL Ecuador's Agricultural Research System:&#13;
Challenges and Opportunities&#13;
15.          Fundamental Problems. The research system suffers from several basic&#13;
problems which all tend to derive from inadequate funding for agricultural research. Because&#13;
INIAP has dominated the system for the last three decades most of the problems relate to&#13;
INIAP. Some of the constraints, however, relate to weaknesses in universities, and lack of&#13;
cohesiveness in the system.&#13;
16.          Too Few Research Scientists. Ecuador has significantly underinvested in&#13;
research scientists (ISNAR and IICA pp. 3943); (Venezian and Moncada pp. 29-30)16. The&#13;
number of researchers with post-graduate degrees in INIAP and the universities is inadequate&#13;
to produce the level of new technical knowledge needed for rapid, sustained increases in&#13;
agricultural productivity. For examnple, INIAP had only 6 Ph.Ds and 65 Masters in 1994,&#13;
down substantially from the mid-1980s. Universities had an additional 9 Ph.Ds and 70 Masters&#13;
in agricultural disciplines. This compares with 126 Ph.Ds and 353 Masters in Colombias&#13;
Govenmuent and semi-public research agencies, and universities (ISNAR unpublished data).&#13;
Several areas especially lack research scientists in Ecuador, including animal sciences, natural&#13;
resources, agricultural economics, rural sociology, biotechnology, and irrigation sciences.&#13;
17.          Inadequate Salaries. The principal constraint to attracting and retaining&#13;
agricultural scientists during the 1980s has been the relatively low salaries offered. As budget&#13;
support declined, INIAP lost four out of five Ph.Ds and 18 of 67 Masters between 1986 and&#13;
1989, or nearly one-third of its senior scientists in a three-year period. While the situation has&#13;
improved somewhat, LIAP continues to be plagued by turnover of research scientists. The&#13;
underlying problem is limited funding for INIAP, universities and other research institutes and&#13;
NGOs which are part of the system. Unless funding is increased, it will be very difficult to&#13;
increase salaries to market levels, even if the problem of an inadequate salary scale were&#13;
resolved. Thus, the research system has a difficult time competing for scarce human capital&#13;
and developing the critical mass of scientists necessary for a sustained research program.&#13;

de Investigac6n y Transferencia de Tecnologia Agropecuaria ". Quito: MAG/USAID, September.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
18.          Little Interaction with the Private Sector. The current research system has&#13;
limited interaction with or support from the private sector. Research by INIAP has become&#13;
increasingly confined to research stations. In the 1980s, research programs were coordinated&#13;
closely with production research programs (Programas de Investigaci6n en Producci6n-&#13;
PIPs) which were carried out on cooperating farms. The PIP program provided a feedback&#13;
System from farmers to researchers as weil as involving researchers more directly in outreach&#13;
activities. However, the PIP program was reduced substantially because of budget constraints.&#13;
Results tend to remain "bottled up" on the stations and to be less relevant to farmers and&#13;
especially to other entrepreneurs in the food system. As public budget support has declined and&#13;
the private sector has had to become more involved in research, farners appear to have&#13;
become less and less supportive of INIAP. Universities, which also have increased their&#13;
involvement in agricultural research, have developed reasonably good linkages to the farmers&#13;
they serve. However, their research base is very small and tends to be oriented primarily&#13;
toward marginal farmers. Ecuador's research system needs to increase on-farm trials and&#13;
feedback from farmers and more fully integrate and include natural resource, economic and&#13;
social concerns into research design and recommendations.&#13;
19.          Limited Participation of Universities. Ecuador's universities are mainly&#13;
teaching institutions which historically have had little involvement in agricultural research or&#13;
exension activities. The number of university research scientists in agriculture (nine Ph.Ds and&#13;
70 Masters) is quite limited relative to the total agricultural faculty of 1,253. But it is&#13;
approximately twice the number of research scientists in INIAP and represents a resource that&#13;
can expand the amount of research being done for the sector.&#13;
20.           The limited agricultural research that is carried out is done almost exclusively&#13;
through thesis work, with some guidance from the major professor. The quality of thesis&#13;
research varies widely depending on source of funding and the quality of related guidance.&#13;
Library and other research facilities are deficient and linkages to the international network of&#13;
agricultural science are extremely limited. Resource constraints and poorly-trained faculty&#13;
result in little laboratory or field work. Classroom lectures dominate the educational process,&#13;
and most of the largely urban-raised students graduate with little or no practical experience in&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
21.          Resources for higher education are spread too thin. What is needed is a more&#13;
foased effort with substantial upgrading of a few key faculties of agriculture. The higher&#13;
education system needs to be linked into the international science network for agriculture and&#13;
more completely integrated into the national research and extension system, especially in the&#13;
area of research.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
22.           Weak International Linkages. Ecuador's research system does not have&#13;
strong, sustained working relationships with sister institutions in the international science&#13;
network. Ecuador science base for agriculture tends to work in isolation compared to many&#13;
other national systems (Posada Torres); (Joint Subcommittee)17. There is ample evidence that&#13;
national research systems substantially increase their productivity as they become fully&#13;
articulated into other national systems, international and regional research centers and foreign&#13;
agricultural universities (Hayami and Ruttan);1 (Arndt, Dalrymple and Ruttan)'9. Such&#13;
linkages eliminate duplication of effort and save scarce resources as the national science base&#13;
exploits research results from the international agricultural science network. Such results from&#13;
one country may have the potential of conferring large benefits in other countries but must be&#13;
accessed and then adapted by the national research system to fit different agro-climactic and&#13;
ecologic conditions in the new location.&#13;
23.           Inadequate Infrastructure. The physical infrastructure supporting Ecuador&#13;
science base for agriculture is beginning to deteriorate. Several experiment stations need to&#13;
have basic infrastructure such as plumbing and electricity modernized. Laboratory equipment&#13;
is outmoded and must be upgraded if the system is to be fully productive. Library holdings are&#13;
out of date and not adequate to provide researchers with access to peer research. Computer&#13;
facilities are limited both in terms of hardware and software. Finally, the research system has&#13;
very limited communication linkages to the international system, such as InterNet.&#13;
24.           Lack of Focus. Due to political pressure and lack of strong leadership INIAP&#13;
lost its focus throughout the 1980s. This led to a proliferation of programs that was not&#13;
matched by the financial resources put at its disposal. For example, by the late 1980s INTAP&#13;
research had expanded into nine research support programs (e.g., plant pathology), eighteen&#13;
crop and livestock commodity programs and four production systems programs (e.g., multiple-&#13;
crops). As a result, INMAP was attempting to cover over 80 separate research programs. The&#13;
problem has become even more difficult with the rapid loss of senior scientists since 1986, as&#13;
inexperienced junior scientists have had to fill positions for which they are not prepared. A&#13;
similar problem exists in universities which basically respond to the priorities present in the&#13;
limited amount of funding they receive.&#13;
25.           Research programs have concentrated almost exclusively on production&#13;
agriculture. Post-harvest handling and storage, processing, marketing and consumption are&#13;
largely ignored in the design of research programs. The important set of natural resources&#13;
issues affecting agriculture are not addressed by IMAP at all. They are dealt with on a&#13;
sporadic and ad hoc basis by private NGOs and foundations such as Funwdci6n Natura and in&#13;
17 Joint Subcommittee (Joint Ecuadorian/North Carolina State University Subcommittee). 1987.&#13;

a few university faculties of biology. Other important areas such as agricultural economics,&#13;
rural sociology and irmgated agriculture also are severely understaffed.&#13;
26.          No Systematic Approach. There is no systematic approach or congruent&#13;
policy structure to condition and focus agricultural research in Ecuador. The four principal&#13;
players in the system-INLAP, universities, the private sector, and NGOs, have little interaction&#13;
with each other. There is no clearly stated set of national priorities to guide resource&#13;
allocations, the institutional structure is disjointed and does not have a policy construct which&#13;
defines objectives and roles, there is little or no incentive for individual researchers to take&#13;
initiative, and the system is isolated from the international science network. More critically, the&#13;
private sector and consumers, which generally reap large benefits from the public goods nature&#13;
of much of the systens research, do not appreciate the role of public sector research in&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
27.          Agricultural research suffers from discontinuity of policies, personnel and&#13;
leadership. For example, there have been six Directors General of INIAP since 1981. Each&#13;
new administration has resulted in changes in the emphasis, organization, key personnel and&#13;
allocation of funds (Posada Torres). Even though INLAP now is an autonomous agency, the&#13;
Director must meet political as well as technical criteia and the agency thus is subject to short-&#13;
term political pressures. The result is a tendency toward centralized planning and management.&#13;
28.          Because research results tend to have a long gestation period, and also to be&#13;
location specific even within a countuy, a decentralized system is more efficient (Hayami and&#13;
Ruttan, Chapter 12). In South American countries the trend is toward autonomous,&#13;
decentralized systems, such as Brazils public corporation, the Brazilian Agency for Agricultural&#13;
Research (EMBRAPA). Ecuador needs to strongly consider the efficiencies inherent in a more&#13;
decentralized structure of it research systeni, including regionalization of INIAP, and stronger&#13;
role for universities.&#13;
Recent Improvements&#13;
29.          There have been several significant developments, especially during the last&#13;
two years, in the Ecuadoran agricultural research system. These developments and policy&#13;
changes provide a solid basis upon which a project intervention can be designed and&#13;
implemented. Collectively, they are a foundation upon which a new, modernized national&#13;
research system can be built.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
30.          An Autonomous INIAP. INLAP was given financial and administaive&#13;
autonomy on July 22, 1992 which has alleviated its salary constaint to some degree. This&#13;
autonomy has allowed the Institute to increase its salary levels to a base of US$750 for Ph.Ds&#13;
and US$450 for Masters. In practice the Ph.Ds currently employed earn as much as US$1,500&#13;
to US$2,000 through joint appointments with or through other entities. INLAP now has the&#13;
authority to increase salaries to market levels, but still will be subject to political pressures&#13;
about salary levels, since it still is a state agency, Also, it is subject to state rules about&#13;
personnel managernent. It can eliminate unwanted positions by buying early retrments, but it&#13;
loses the budget associated with the position. And it can only increase its staff through a&#13;
complicated approval process.&#13;
31.          Nevertheless, INIAP now enjoys substantially greater flexibility which should&#13;
facilitate the modernization of the research system. But even with modest increases in salary&#13;
levels, the Institute and universities face growing salary pressure from the increasing&#13;
internationalization of Ecuador's economy and the resulting integration of the professional&#13;
labor market.&#13;
32.          An Endowment Fund. INIAP also was given an endowment fimd of&#13;
S/. 20,000 million as part of the process of receiving its autonomy. The Government agreed to&#13;
pay this in three installments, with the first of S/. 7,000 million (about USS3.25 million at the&#13;
current exchange rate of 2,170) already paid, and the second intallment of S/. 7,000 million&#13;
now due. This is an important step in increasing budget support for INLAP. However, archaic&#13;
regulations force INIAP to invest the fund in state bonds which yield less than the rate of&#13;
inflation, so the principal balance is being eroded. If this problem can be addressed, the fimd&#13;
will grow to nearly US$10.0 million by 1997. If INLAP sells assets not needed for research,&#13;
the find could grow to as much as US$30.0 million by 1999. Interest eamnings on a fund of&#13;
this size will make a major contribution to INLAPs budget, as the project comes to an end.&#13;
Even with an endowment of this size, however, the Government will need to increase its aual&#13;
budget support to INIAP if the country is to meet minimum international standards of one&#13;
percent of AgGDP invested in agricultural research.&#13;
33.          A Downsizing Plan. lNIAPs current staffing, is 433 consisting of 194&#13;
professionals, 47 technicians, 87 administrative stag 50 service staff and 61 vacancies. In&#13;
addition six INIAP staff are away on higher degree training and 33 professional staff are&#13;
provided through contracts (many of which are in the technology transfer area). The recent&#13;
downsizing reduced total staff from 667 to 433 by major cut-backs in non-professional staff&#13;
INIAP appears to have done an excellent job in absorbing this reduction, although the number&#13;
of technicians per researcher is now below what is normal at research institutes and far below&#13;
the ratio in private sector agricultural research in Ecuador. Of the 188 professionals on hand&#13;
now 12 (six percent) are involved in senior management at headquarters and the seven research&#13;
stations, 11 (six percent) are in finance and administration, 10 (five percent) in the planning and&#13;
evaluation unit, five (three percent) in information/communications, 21 (11 percent) in&#13;
technology transfer, 13 (seven percent) in production and 116 (62 percent) in conducting&#13;
research. This suggests a rational and balanced distribution, particularly as many of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
contracted staff not included in this total have a function that relates closely to technology&#13;
transfer and validation so that the real figure for this task may be closer to 20 percent.&#13;
34.          The manpower plan for training in the project will need to be carefully designed&#13;
in terms of disciplines in order to ensure that it is tailored to develop persons who are potential&#13;
leaders, while at the same time ensuring that INIAP trains a core of expertise in all key&#13;
disciplines. An effort should be made to ensure that all trainees take some courses in&#13;
management as this is likely to be an important part of the task of a number of them when they&#13;
return. In addition to training biological researchers the training programn should be used to&#13;
strengthen the planning/economics expertise in INIAP and also skills in information, so that&#13;
INLAP can capitalize on the "information revolution" that is now taking place throughout the&#13;
world.&#13;
35.          Priority Setting. INIAP has been aware of the need to focus and concentrate&#13;
its research program for several years. It has sponsored a careful analysis of research priorities&#13;
(Palomino and Norton)20 and has developed and implemented a more focused and&#13;
concentrated research program (RIAP 1993b)21. This program includes 12 national programs&#13;
covering 20 crops, and another seven interdisciplinary research programs. This new, focused&#13;
set of priorities is an improvement over the ad hoc collection of research programs that had&#13;
evolved in response to political pressures in the 1980s. The Ministry of Agriculture has&#13;
adopted these priorities as the basis for funding subprojects in the Agricultural Research&#13;
Project.&#13;
36.          Increased University Involvement. Universities have become increasingly&#13;
involved in agricultural research throughout the 1980s, with funding support from CONUEP.&#13;
They have developed small pockets of capability with substantial local support from farmers&#13;
and their associations. They have become increasingly aggressive in pursuing relationships and&#13;
funding support from other sources, including international agencies. They also have&#13;
developed extension and outreach programs to serve local clientele. The universities represent&#13;
a fledgling base of regional support for agricultural research from the private sector. Their&#13;
faculty resources need to be further integrated into the research system on a more regular and&#13;
sustained basis, for they are an important resource for strengthening and modernizing it.&#13;
37.          Expanding Linkages within the System. Linkages among the four major&#13;
players in the agricultural research system are increasing. Universities have signed research&#13;
contracts with INAP, the Foundation for Agricultural Development (FUNDAGRO) and&#13;
others (Venezian and Moncada pp. 44145). NGOs are becoming a more integral part of the of&#13;
the agricultural science network in Ecuador through contracts for research with INIAP and&#13;
universities. And the private sector has increased its ties to the system, especially to&#13;
universities. INIAP has long had important ties to university faculties. It selects students in&#13;

their last year from various university faculties and provides them with scholarships as part of&#13;
the APo Tcnico Rural program (one year of required public service as part of a undegraduae&#13;
degree program). In return, the students work at INIAP experiment stations where they learn&#13;
basic research skills and do their thesis as part of an INIAP research project, under close&#13;
supervision and guidance of INIAP scientists. The numbers of students trained under this&#13;
program have ranged from 15-40 per year, depending on the number of positions assigned by&#13;
MAG (ISNAR and IICA p. 37). INIAP hires the most capable of these graduates into its&#13;
research staff Thus, INIAP identifies a select corps of advanced university students and trains&#13;
them in research methodology and applied agricultural sciences. In essence, it provides the&#13;
closest thing there is to post-graduate training in agriculture science in Ecuador. It also has had&#13;
a fairly good program of advanced training for its staff in various degree and nondegree&#13;
programs abroad.&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
ECUADOR&#13;
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECI&#13;
Economic Evaluation&#13;
1.            Economic analysis for the project has been carried out to test its economic&#13;
viability. A multiple criteria model has been utilized in light of the fact that agricultural&#13;
research is focused upon different objectives such as: economic growth, distribution of&#13;
income and sustainability; multiple criteria models seem to be more appropriate to&#13;
evaluate the attainment of different objectives.&#13;
2.            The model used is one which was developed in 1990 by the International&#13;
Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). It is a partial equilibrium model called "Analysis&#13;
of Economic Surpluses" (MODEXC) and is designed to evaluate the direct benefits of&#13;
new technology and associated income distribution results. The evaluation for the&#13;
proposed project, which measures the potential impact of technology generation and&#13;
transfer projects, uses MODEXC for several reasons:&#13;
* The model has a solid theoretical basis. It explicitly includes exogenous changes in&#13;
supply and demand, that are not linked to technological change under analysis;&#13;
3  The model has been successfully used in a number of studies: Pachico, Lynam and&#13;
Jones (1987)22, Alston, Edwards and Freebairn (1988)2, Rivas et al (1992)24,&#13;
Jarvis and Sere (1988)25.&#13;
*  The resulting indicators permit prioritization among commodities. They show&#13;
which commodities produce larger social benefits and which should have a higher&#13;
priority when research budgets are being assigned.&#13;

3.          The social benefits and costs for each technological option are estimated&#13;
and benefits of each technology are distributed among specific activities (such as genetic&#13;
improvements or new fertilization systems). This process allows estimation of economic&#13;
efficiency for each activity.&#13;
4.          In order to evaluate the impact of technology transfer activities, it is&#13;
necessary to emphasize that their objective is to get new technologies accepted by the&#13;
market. Given this fact, it is necessary to consider these activities in the technology&#13;
generation process, and quantify the benefits according to their relative weight in the&#13;
process. This should be taken into account when the case of the National Autonomous&#13;
Institute for Agricultural Research (INIAP) is analyzed. It should be remembered that&#13;
INIAP does not transfer technology to producers. Its mission is to generate and validate&#13;
technology for the use of private and public organizations that are in charge of transfer&#13;
and extension activities.&#13;
5.          The selection of commodities considered under the analysis is based on the&#13;
relative weight each commodity holds in the gross national agricultural product (GNAP).&#13;
The GNAP used in this case represents the average for years 1991 through 1993.&#13;
6.          The result is a group of 19 products that accounts for 97 percent of the&#13;
total aggregate value of domestic production. However, the model has been run for just&#13;
16 products --excluding sugar cane, tomatoes and cotton, that only account for four&#13;
percent of total aggregate production. The following table shows the assumed average&#13;
annual growth rate for each of the 16 products. The output projections are based on&#13;
NIAP historical data which measures the impact of a package of technology (similar to&#13;
the one applied under the proposed project) on commodity production. The price&#13;
projections are based on historical commodity price trends.&#13;

7.           These growth assumptions for specific commodities, along with the&#13;
following additional assumptions have been incorporated in the economic model in order&#13;
to estimate benefits for the overall project. These additional assumptions include:&#13;
3 An estimation of the exogenous production growth rates and demand for the&#13;
commodities considered under the analysis;&#13;
*  Identification of supply and demand price elasticity, and demand income elasticity&#13;
values for the selected commodities;&#13;
*  The consumption structure for selected commodities in relation to income levels&#13;
consistent with those of beneficiaries under the project; and&#13;
*  Identification of farm models representative of farms impacted by the project.&#13;
8.          In addition, to measure the impact of specific technologies under the&#13;
project, technical coefficients and research costs associated with new technologies, and the&#13;
way in which these technologies influence the supply of the selected commodities, have&#13;
been estimated. These estimates include the:&#13;
* Yields of the new and present technologies;&#13;
* Time frame in which the new technologies are inplemented;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
* Time frame for adoption of the new technologies;&#13;
* Potential land area where new technologies could be used;&#13;
* Percentage of potential area required by the new technologies;&#13;
* Research activities that are undertaken to obtain a given technology;&#13;
* Estimate of the probability of success of the research process; and&#13;
* Cash flow of research costs for each activity and technology.&#13;
9.           This data allows for the estimation of increased production because of&#13;
technological change and its adoption by farmers. The yield growth rates used in the&#13;
assumptions are averaged over the period used in the evaluation, while real growth rates&#13;
may be more uneven. It is also assumed that the technologies are scale neutral and all&#13;
farmers will participate in their use to varying extents. This is purely technical infonnation,&#13;
taken directly at INIAP's research stations, from interviews with different commodity&#13;
research specialists.&#13;
10.          The model calculates points of market equilibrium for each of the fifteen&#13;
years in which the project is evaluated. Based on this, the model estimates producers and&#13;
consumer surpluses, separating those that can be ascribed to technological factors. It&#13;
should be kept in mind that the benefits ascribed to the project are only a part of the total&#13;
benefits. Only thirty per cent of the surpluses, multiplied by the probability of success for&#13;
each technology through the research and transfer process has been considered the benefit&#13;
that can be ascribed to the project. This probability of success ranges between 75 and 80&#13;
percent depending on the specific technology.&#13;
11.          The results of calculating the market equilibrium for all commodities&#13;
considered under the analysis, and separating out only benefits which accrue from&#13;
technology use, are shown in the following table. Total net benefits are estimated at&#13;
nearly US$750 million in year 15. Using the methodology described in paragraph 10 to&#13;
estimate the portion of these total benefits which can be ascribed to the proposed project,&#13;
net benefits from the project are estimated at nearly US$176 million in year 15.&#13;
12.          Using the benefit flows attributable to the project, as shown in the&#13;
following table, and the project costs for both Agricultural Research and Extension, the&#13;
Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) are calculated. The NPV is&#13;
estimated at about US$389 million, using a discount rate of 12 percent. The IRR is&#13;
estimated at 52 percent. These results are in line with numerous ex post studies regarding&#13;
the impact of agriculture research and technology projects in Latin America and&#13;
worldwide.&#13;

13.         Finally, the analysis also shows that there are significant benefits to&#13;
international trade; that is, for the commodities which were analyzed using an open&#13;
economy assumption. For most of these, there is a high probability that exports would&#13;
increase, assuming appropriate economic policies, infrastructure, and sanitary conditions.&#13;
14.         The following table shows that the commercial benefits, which would&#13;
accrue from increased exports of these commodities, would significantly improve&#13;
Ecuador's trade balance. When the results of the model application are consolidated, the&#13;
trade surplus for these products could grow by 49 percent in the year 2,000, from&#13;
US$415 millions to US$619 millions, and at the end of the project it could more than&#13;
triple to US$1,303 million.&#13;

Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
15.         The sensitivity analysis canied out for the project tests the impact of either&#13;
overall income decreases or cost increases. As the following tables show, by decreasing&#13;
benefits such that income resulting from the project falls by 20 percent, the estimated internal&#13;
rate of return would decline by eight percent. This represents a reduction in the NPV of about&#13;
US$95 million. Because of the relatively high NPV and return, as the switching value&#13;
demonstrates, benefits would have to fall by over 80 percent to obtain an NPV of zero. A&#13;
20 percent increase in overall costs yields similar NPV and IRR results. To obtain an NPV of&#13;
zero, costs would have to increase by nearly six times.&#13;
16.         These results suggest that project returns are quite sensitive to movements in&#13;
overall benefits and costs. Such sensitivity can be explained somewhat by the significant&#13;
variation of commodities incorporated in the model and the associated range of estimates for&#13;
movements in prices and output. Furthermore, the estimated benefits are based exclusively on&#13;
improved product yields, directly linked to commodity prices and output. There is no&#13;
consideration of off-farm income which could result from the project and would be mnore stable&#13;
than income from the production and sale of commodities. In any case, as the switching values&#13;
indicate, the estimated project returns and net present value are significantly high enough that a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
20 percent unfavorable shift in either benefits or costs would not produce negative overall&#13;
reslts.&#13;

ANNEX 5&#13;
ECUADOR&#13;
AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
Guidelines for the Competitve Research Grants Program and Research and&#13;
Education Exchange Partnerships&#13;
1.          A Competitive Research Grants Program (CRG Program) is a new venture&#13;
in Ecuador. Fortunately, as suggested above, it is not a totally foreign concept to&#13;
professionals there, many of whom have been educated in the United States or in Europe.&#13;
Several agricultural researchers and engineers in both university and private nonprofit&#13;
industry sectors that have competed successfully for research awards from foreign&#13;
institutions, such as the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C., U. S.A. Moreover, the&#13;
Ecuadoran university community already has an identifiable competitive grants program in&#13;
place, which is administered by CONUEP (Manual de Evaluaci6n de Proyectos de&#13;
Investigaci6n). It should be noted, however, that although a competitive grants program&#13;
is in place in the universities, the program has never been funded at the recommended level&#13;
of 1.0 percent of GNP. In 1992, for example CONUEPs available research funds were&#13;
under 0.01 percent GNP. Thus, while the program may not be well known, or appreciated&#13;
in all sectors, its existence shows that there is a small number of agricultural scientists and&#13;
engineers at work in the universities. They should be able to prepare research proposals&#13;
and compete in a CRG Program, even though their number might be small.&#13;
2.           A CRG Program operates on the principle that the system selects for&#13;
scientific excellence by providing the Principle Investigator (PI), or the Project Director&#13;
(PD) with adequate funding to enable research on a particular topic. Research enablement&#13;
typically includes support for personnel, research materials, research instrumentation,&#13;
opportunities for attending and participating at scientific meetings, and paying costs for&#13;
publishing scientific results in edited professional journals. The PI is the designated&#13;
individual researcher responsible for preparing and submitting the research grant, and for&#13;
carrying out the research plan. A PD is an individual researcher responsible for&#13;
administering a group, or team, of researchers working on a specific research theme. For&#13;
example, a PD would be the professional scientist in charge of a multidisciplinary, multi-&#13;
institutional association of university, INLAP, NGO, and/or private sector laboratories.&#13;
3.           The CRG Program encourages, and sometimes requires, multidisciplinary,&#13;
multi-institutional associations or partnerships. For example, an individual research grant&#13;
has one PI, but may have additional Co-PIs, or Contractors, from different disciplines&#13;
and/or institutions. This arrangement is always encouraged, where appropriate, and&#13;
allows for the performance of joint research projects between different university, INIAP,&#13;
NGOs, and private sector laboratories. (Private sector research laboratories will be&#13;
eligible to enter into partnerships with these entities and will be expected to provide&#13;
appropriate matching support for the project.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
4.          The success of the CRG Program in identifying and supporting excellent&#13;
research requires a simple, direct system for Award selection. The steps in the process are&#13;
few and are summarized below (a detailed description follows in Figure 1):&#13;
* the PI/PD submits the proposal for scientific peer review to the Research&#13;
Implementation Unit (MU) via his/her institutional base;&#13;
*  the proposal is checked for completeness and entered into the competition;&#13;
*  the proposal is reviewed by the MU Director in charge of its review and sent to&#13;
five panel members with a request for written reviews;&#13;
*  the Peer Review Panel convenes, as scheduled, to discuss each proposal and&#13;
make funding recommendations (after discussion of each proposal, the five&#13;
panelists responsible for earlier written reviews prepare an additional statement&#13;
to convey the "sense" of the panel discussion to the PI, i.e., was the proposal&#13;
received enthusiastically, was the research topic well presented, interesting,&#13;
was it competitive, or, if not, what might the PI do to make it competitive,&#13;
etc.); and&#13;
- the MU makes a final funding decision and notifies the PI and the grantee (the&#13;
PIs institutional base) if an Award is to be made and the amount.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
5.          As illustrated in Figure 1, once the applicant proposal arrives at the MU&#13;
office, the process of review begins. The proposal is checked by office staff for&#13;
completeness and compliance with format guidelines as defined in the Operational Manual.&#13;
In the event that the proposal is incomplete, or is not compliant, the proposer will be&#13;
notified and given ten working days to send the required number of corrected copies of&#13;
the proposal. Each proposal is assigned an identification number by office staff, and the&#13;
proposal is given to an MU Officer.&#13;
6.           The MU Officer will review the proposal further for compliance with&#13;
format guidelines and for appropriateness in the research program. Inappropriate&#13;
proposals are those determined to lie outside MU funding areas and will be withdrawn&#13;
from competition. The proposer will be notified of this decision. The proposal will not&#13;
normally be returned.&#13;
7.           Careful review of each research grant proposal is a time-consuming,&#13;
laborious task. As illustrated in Figure 1, the MU Officer must judge each proposal&#13;
separately based upon the reviews of experts in the field. All the proposals will be&#13;
reviewed by the Peer Review Panel. Review panel discussions of research grant proposals&#13;
occur behind closed doors. Only MU personnel and other individuals authorized by the&#13;
MU office may be present during these discussions.&#13;
8.          Under circumstances when the MU Officer performs a site-visit and/or&#13;
sends the proposal to additional experts for ad hoc (outside) review (in addition to Peer&#13;
Review Panelists), panel members requested to review the proposal must always be&#13;
informed of the results of these actions. The MU may decide to pursue these additional&#13;
modes of review either before or after the Peer Review Panel meeting. Proposals of&#13;
"sitting" members on the Peer Review Panel only may be reviewed without direct&#13;
consultation with the Peer Review Panel. In these cases, the MU Officer must obtain the&#13;
professional evaluation (in writing and signed) of three experts in the field in order to&#13;
arrive at a funding decision. This decision must also be agreed to by at least one&#13;
additional, appropriate MU grant review officer.&#13;
9.           At the end of the review, PI/PD notification begins. The PI/PDs of Awards&#13;
are notified first by telephone and officially once all conditions are met, through his/her&#13;
grantee business office. To initiate the Award, the MU explains the conditions and&#13;
requests the PI/PD to prepare and send an Abstract (about 200 words) of the project in&#13;
laymans terms for public information, and a revised budget section and research grant&#13;
cover sheet, signed by both the PI/PD(s) and the grantee responsible officer if the amount&#13;
of the Award is different from that originally requested. After all the requisite budgetary&#13;
documents have been signed and submitted to the MU office, the Award can be made and&#13;
money transferred to the appropriate grantee business office. Finally, a congratulatory&#13;
letter with copies of proposal reviews (names of reviewers are confidential and do not&#13;
show on these copies) and the panel statement are sent to the PI/PD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
10.         In the CRG Program when an Award is made, the PI/PD institutional base&#13;
(e.g., university, INIAP, or NGO) is the grantee and is responsible for the institutional&#13;
accountability of the MU research moneys. This is generally handled by specialists in&#13;
business/accounting offices. The accounting office must establish an account in the name&#13;
of the PI/PD by which he/she can authorize spending award money in the support of the&#13;
research project. In the event that the PI/PD official changes institutions, any residual,&#13;
available funds from the Award will be transferable to the new PM/PD support institution.&#13;
11.         In a similar manner, letters of decline are prepared for each one of the&#13;
proposals not to be funded. These letters express regrets and are accompanied by copies&#13;
of each review (names of reviewers are confidential and do not show on these copies) plus&#13;
a Peer Review Panel statement, which should reflect the tone and note important points&#13;
raised during panel discussion that could be of use in reshaping and/or focusing the&#13;
research program for resubmission.&#13;
12.         Award Selection Criteria. The Award selection is the most important&#13;
activity of the Competitive Grant System and the final decision to recommend an Award&#13;
rests with the MU Officer responsible for the grant review. However, in every review&#13;
process the scientific merit of grant proposals that lie outside the MU Officers area of&#13;
expertise must be decided. In this, and all other cases as well, the MU officer must obtain&#13;
evidence to support a decision from experts in the research area of the grant proposal. As&#13;
outlined in the previous section. three resources for proposal review are available: site-&#13;
visits on the part of the MU officer, or other qualified professional designated by the MU&#13;
officer; ad hoc (reviewers not on the Peer Review Panel) mail reviews; and&#13;
recommendations made by panelists in their reviews and after discussions at the formal&#13;
panel meeting. All proposals will be reviewed by the Peer Review Panel (except those&#13;
submitted by panelists themselves; see earlier discussion). The proposal will be judged by&#13;
at least three panelists independently (before the panel meeting, panelists will have written&#13;
and signed their independent proposal reviews and distributed them to the other&#13;
appropriate panel members beforehand), and finally after panel discussion. The MU&#13;
officer may rely only on panelists, or can choose independently or at the request of the&#13;
panel, to seek additional expert advice by ad hoc review and/or by conducting a site visit.&#13;
No pending proposal(s) from a panelist present at the panel session will be mentioned on&#13;
the list of proposals given to the panel to review. These proposals will be reviewed solely&#13;
by ad hoc review.&#13;
13.         In the process of judging the scientific merit of any research grant proposal&#13;
addressing INIAP initiatives and other national priorities in agricultural research&#13;
established by MAG, the responsible MU officer should consider the following criteria&#13;
stated briefly below in arriving at a funding decision.&#13;
* Research Performance Competence. Is the PI/PD capable/experienced in&#13;
performing proposed experiments, is the proposed technical approach sound,&#13;
and are facilities available to perform the work?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56&#13;
* Intrinsic Merit of the Research. What will be the end result of the project and&#13;
will it contribute to, or lead to, important advances in the field?&#13;
* Utility or Relevance of the Research. Will the results of the project make&#13;
important contributions to general knowledge outside the immediate area of&#13;
interest, and serve as a basis for improved technology or as a solution to&#13;
environmental problems?&#13;
* Will the project contribute to a better understanding or improvement of&#13;
agricultural production, implementation of better measures for protection of&#13;
the environment, as well as stimulate further research, education; and&#13;
*  development of manpower in agriculture sciences?&#13;
14.         In addition, the "Manual de Evaluacion de Proyectos de Investigaci6n"&#13;
(CONUEP, 1991) cites additional important criteria that include but are not limited to:&#13;
clarity of presentation, organization of ideas in a convincing manner, identification of&#13;
research objectives and goals, significance of the research program, and proper grammar.&#13;
Research and Education Exchange Partnerships with International Institutions&#13;
15.         Research and Education and Exchange Partnerships would be based on&#13;
themes that are designated as areas of national priorities by the Ministry of Agriculture and&#13;
would be based in Ecuadoran research institutes, foundations and universities.&#13;
Partnerships based in institutes and foundations would emphasize research while those&#13;
based in universities would emphasize education and training in agricultural research. The&#13;
Partnership grant would be awarded to the Ecuadoran institution.&#13;
16.         The role of the Partnerships with International Institutions is to:&#13;
*  foster joint research program development;&#13;
*  develop academic units with the intellectual recognition for functioning&#13;
as the units for awarding graduates in agricultural sciences at the M.S.&#13;
level;&#13;
*  organize special 6 to 8 month introductory course on the agricultural&#13;
theme of the Partnership to be taken by all appropriate Ph.D. and M.S.&#13;
fellowship candidates before their departure for foreign study. These&#13;
special courses should be organized to form the center of a fully&#13;
developed, recognized M.S. degree program;&#13;
* establish specialized technological centers equipped with research&#13;
equipment items in support of research and technology transfer;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57&#13;
* recruit and help to identify candidates for Ph.D. and M.S. fellowships;&#13;
* attract highly qualified Ph.D.-level professionals to participate in the&#13;
program as adjunct faculty members; and&#13;
* purchase laboratory materials to help support Ecuadoran student&#13;
graduate degree thesis research.&#13;
17.          Partnership facilities and personnel will play a major role in the&#13;
development of the Ecuadoran agricultural community in technical development and&#13;
educational training. However, the number of advanced degree personnel both within&#13;
INIAP and in the universities is too small to accomplish the task alone. To help make up&#13;
for this "short fall" appointments must be made of adjunct faculty bearing the degree of&#13;
Ph.D. and actively working the field.&#13;
18    .     Adjunct faculty appointments are quite common among developed country&#13;
universities and are used to bring individuals with highly specialized skills, who hold Ph.D.&#13;
degrees, into a specific program, or into an academic unit,. These adjunct faculty&#13;
members are nonpaid salary appointments who receive voting/decision-making privileges&#13;
within the "appointing" unit, where they also benefit from the prestige of the appointment&#13;
and their association with the research program itself. Faculty members from U.S.&#13;
institutions often participate in programs such as these by obtaining paid leaves of absence&#13;
from their home institutions. Room and board living expenses are usually provided by the&#13;
host institution. For this, adjunct faculty members will bring their own expertise to bear&#13;
on the project in Ecuador. They will also be required to aid in the host institutions&#13;
teaching responsibilities either in the classroom or in the research laboratory. All adjunct&#13;
professors and adjunct faculty appointments from the private sector (qualified personnel&#13;
who hold the degree of Ph.D. in an appropriate area), need to participate in the 6 to 8&#13;
month introductory course on the agricultural theme of the Partnership. It is believed that&#13;
this classroom/laboratory experience can serve to initiate graduate student training in&#13;
Ecuador. Thus, adjunct faculty appointments will be made to qualified academicians and&#13;
private sector professionals in Ecuador and outside the country.&#13;
19.         The development of graduate degree programs inside Ecuador should be a&#13;
primary objective of the Partnership program, especially in university-based projects. The&#13;
Central University of Quito, the largest public university in Ecuador, is already organizing&#13;
and presenting course offerings in agricultural sciences using faculty recruited from both&#13;
within and outside of Ecuador. At present the postgraduate program (Programa de&#13;
Postgrado en Ciencias Agricolas) has three 10 week course offerings with meetings&#13;
occurring approximately once each month over an entire year. A Diploma of&#13;
Specialization (Diploma de Especialista) is granted upon completion of all 10 modules.&#13;
Initiatives such as this one, suggest that the organization of a 6 to 8 month introductory&#13;
course by individual universities using both university regular and adjunct faculty should&#13;
be readily possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58&#13;
20.         In accord with this discussion, a Partnership with its adjunct faculty (and&#13;
appropriate adjunct technical researchers) can become the site for the formation of a M.S.&#13;
degree program in a specific area. These M.S. degree programs should begin to be&#13;
developed one year after the first Partnership awards have been made. It will not be&#13;
possible to begin to organize a recognized Ph.D. degree program for at least ten years,&#13;
after Ph.Ds trained in this program return and have had the opportunity to develop their&#13;
own research careers in Ecuador. Even then, the research community will need to&#13;
continue to rely upon adjunct faculty interest and cooperation, and these programs will&#13;
most likely be inter-institutional.&#13;
21.          A Partnership Grant should not be looked upon as a permanent mechanism&#13;
for the funding of a group of investigators, but as a mechanism that serves a particular&#13;
purpose at a particular time in the scientific development of the Ecuadoran agricultural&#13;
research community. It would be expected that some projects initiated under Partnership&#13;
funding might evolve or expand in such a way as to warrant separate lines of support,&#13;
while new Partnership projects would emerge to take their place. When a Partnership no&#13;
longer fulfills the intended puipose, it would be expected to come to a natural end. As&#13;
such time, support of ongoing research may, of course, be sought under the Competitive&#13;
Research Grants Program.&#13;
22.          "Sister" Institution Partnerships. There are a large number of models&#13;
available for both informal and formal "sister" institutional alignments. The formation of&#13;
an analogous networks can be organized in joint INIAP, university, private sector research&#13;
partnerships with international institutions in Ecuador. Institutional Partnerships must be&#13;
organized with great care and the "sister" institute must be fully aware of what is&#13;
expected. In the case of universities, the Ecuadoran institution will cooperate with its&#13;
"sister" institute in both student education and in laying the groundwork for a degree-&#13;
granting Ecuadoran "institution" in agricultural services.&#13;
23.          The task of training foreign graduate students is the traditional role of most&#13;
"sister" institute partnerships. Graduate student training will begin in Ecuador in special&#13;
introductory courses (in which appropriate "sister" institute adjunct faculty members will&#13;
participate) followed by additional course work at the foreign "sister" institute or other&#13;
appropriate institution. Once this course work is completed, students will return to their&#13;
Ecuadoran institution. In the case of the Ph.D. candidate, to perform his/her research&#13;
thesis work. Once the Ph.D. thesis research is completed to the satisfaction of both&#13;
institutions, the degree candidate will return to the "sister" institute, or other appropriate&#13;
institution, to defend the thesis in accord with the requirements for the degree of Ph.D.&#13;
24.          The task of building a recognized award granting entity in Ecuador in&#13;
agricultural research will be long-term as discussed earlier. At present, the Ecuadoran&#13;
agricultural research community is small and does not have a critical number of Ph.D.-&#13;
level personnel to grant a recognized graduate degree. This could begin to change,&#13;
however, under favorable conditions that will allow for the Competitive Research Grants&#13;
program to take affect, and which in turn should give employment for returning young&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59&#13;
Ph.D. researchers to Ecuador and provide them with the means to organize their own&#13;
research programs. As a beginning, the Partnership with useful "Sister" Institution&#13;
Partnerships can operate to form a foundation. In keeping with this objective, the&#13;
Ecuadoran university in its negotiations with a sister institute, must make the need clear&#13;
for sharing in the responsibility of laying the groundwork for a graduate degree granting&#13;
program in Ecuador through active faculty teaching/research commitments.&#13;
25.         Applicants for advanced degree fellowships will be evaluated on their&#13;
ability, accomplishments, and potential as evidenced by letters of recommendation; results&#13;
on standardized graduate school entry examinations (as required by the admissions&#13;
committee at a "sister" institution); the quality and significance of their proposed research&#13;
topic; the cross-disciplinary potential of the research topic; and the likely impact of the&#13;
proposed training and research on the applicant's future scientific development and long-&#13;
range career goals. Applications will be reviewed by an advisory committee comprised of&#13;
faculty members which includes adjunct faculty members. This advisory committee will&#13;
make its recommendations to the NGO administering the competitive aspects of the&#13;
project where final selection of graduate fellows will be made. The NGO will notify&#13;
awardees within one month after the advisory committee recommendation, and&#13;
immediately begin to lay plans, in consultation with the sponsoring Ecuadoran institution,&#13;
for the student's advanced graduate training outside the country. This could include&#13;
language training, as appropriate.&#13;
26.         Administration of the Partnerships. The Director of the MU will have&#13;
primary responsibility for organizing the Partnership grant review and award processes&#13;
which will also be adjudicated by the Peer Review Panel. To respond effectively to the&#13;
research and educational needs of a growing Ecuadoran Agricultural Research&#13;
Community, the duties of the MU officers must be far-reaching and their decisions should&#13;
be viewed as being informed and just. They should include, but are not limited to:&#13;
*  helping to identify and interpret national priorities in agriculture established by&#13;
the MAG in terms appropriate to education/training topic areas in the&#13;
agricultural sciences;&#13;
*  working closely with Partnership grantees to establish excellent "sister"&#13;
institution partnerships in strong support for advanced degree education of&#13;
Ecuadoran students and in aiding to lay the groundwork for a recognized&#13;
degree-granting entity in agricultural sciences in Ecuador;&#13;
*  aiding universities, institutes and foundations receiving agricultural research&#13;
grant support in identifying and recruiting students qualified for advanced&#13;
training at the M.S. and Ph.D. levels in agricultural sciences;&#13;
*  working with universities in organizing an appropriate graduate fellowship&#13;
advisory committee comprised of both regular faculty and adjunct faculty&#13;
members;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60&#13;
*  assisting advanced degree fellows, in consultation with the sponsoring&#13;
researcher(s) and the appropriate SATC unit in preparing the student for&#13;
graduate studies outside Ecuador. (The Educational Director should already&#13;
be in direct contact with appropriate "sister" universities and/or placement&#13;
services);&#13;
*  seeing to the personal needs graduate fellowship awardees while outside the&#13;
country; and&#13;
*  helping arrange for students to return to Ecuador to do thesis work on&#13;
appropriate topics.&#13;

ECUADOR&#13;
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT&#13;
Priorities for Research&#13;
Memorandum No. 0156 SPIS/DPIPS&#13;
TO             Technical and Administrative Undersecretary&#13;
FROM           Director of Sector Planning, Investment and Budget&#13;
SUBJECT       Selection and Prioritization of Crops and Livestock&#13;
DATE           February 8, 1995&#13;
Since the matter is considered of great importance for proper management by the&#13;
agnculture sector authorities, it has been thought advisable to select and rank the crops and&#13;
livestock on which the State should focus its attention, in view of the limited resources available. I&#13;
am accordingly detailing in the following the background data, criteria and procedures used in&#13;
selecting and ranking the crops and livestock discussed and their identification.&#13;
L     Background Data and Justification&#13;
Agricultural policy management in the closing years of the twentieth century does&#13;
not have the same roots and purposes as in the early 1900s. The circumstances have changed&#13;
drastically, especially if the situation as it was then is compared with the 1950s and 1960s when&#13;
the so-called "Green revolution " was at its height. The flow of events has caused successive&#13;
governments to take steps aimed primarily at meeting domestic supply needs and including&#13;
adoption of measures designed to ensure responsible use and control of renewable natural&#13;
resources.&#13;
For a while, the public sectors concern did not go beyond obtaining higher&#13;
productivity and profitability, so that emphasis was placed on the research and extension services&#13;
as a means for harnessing the potentials offered by technological development. However, this&#13;
policy proved inadequate as the years passed. The social changes and pressures, the deterioration&#13;
of the environment as a result of overuse and poor management of natural and technological&#13;
resources, the variable behavior of the market in the vast field formed by a supply and demand&#13;
extending beyond the national borders and the demands for larger incomes expressed by the&#13;
various actors in the agriculture sector gave rise to a more complex and less linear approach to the&#13;
problems noted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62&#13;
Accordingly, generation and transfer of technology and the establishment of a&#13;
price policy with a view to increasing productivity and improving profitability are no longer the&#13;
only goals, but steps are envisaged for upgrading product quality, ensuring appropriate use of&#13;
agricultural chemnicals and biological agents to reduce toxicity and pollution levels in persons and&#13;
the environment, locating and delirmiting crops in light of their agroecological and commercial&#13;
possibilities, conserving natural resources by means of appropriate use and providing the&#13;
infrastructure and services necessary for the production, conservation and transportation of&#13;
agrolivestock and forestry products.&#13;
In this context, the strategies to be employed and the application of new know&#13;
how, such as the organization and training of groups for self-nanagement purposes, design,&#13;
dissemination and implementation of agrosylvopastoral systems and their derivatives, and the&#13;
application of biotechnology, are also irnportant.&#13;
In light of the foregoing, it will be readily apparent that the conceptual framework,&#13;
for development purposes, of the agriculture sector has changed. Today production and&#13;
productivity are not the only concems, but consideration is also given to return and sustainable&#13;
managernent of the resources used in the production process, especially those connected with&#13;
preservation of the environment.&#13;
However, the promotion and implementation of all these activities are subject to&#13;
the funds available, which is why all the needs cannot be met simultaneously in a given time&#13;
period. Selection and prioritization are therefore called for, so that the results obtained will be real&#13;
and highly beneficial, both from the economic standpoint and in the social and ecological spheres.&#13;
IL    Criteria and Procedures for Selection and Prioritization&#13;
In accordance with the above, the Directorate of Planning formulated seven&#13;
criteria that facilitated the selection and ranking of the crops and livestock on which the&#13;
agricultural public sector will have to concentrate in the short and medium term. These criteria are&#13;
the following:&#13;
Area cultivated or total number of animals per species.&#13;
Potential percentage increase in productivity.&#13;
-     Number of technologies available per crop or species of animal.&#13;
-     lInportance of the product in the family shopping basket.&#13;
-     Possibilities of exporting the product.&#13;
-     The products commercial perfonnance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
63&#13;
The weighting factors are described in Attachment 1 and the information required&#13;
for the ratings is extracted from documents produced by the Directorates of Policy Analysis,&#13;
Agricultural Infonnation and Renewable Natural Resources; and of Research, Technology&#13;
Transfer and Extension.&#13;
In addition, the National Agricultural Research Institute (anstituto Naciona de&#13;
Investigaciones Agropecuarias - ILMP) has also produced for its own account a selection and&#13;
prioritization of crops and livestock, based on the following criteria assigned appropriate&#13;
weightings:&#13;
-     Effective demand for technology on the farmers' part.&#13;
-     Need for research.&#13;
-     Social importance of the item in terms of food supply.&#13;
-     Availability of technology for transfer.&#13;
-     Commercial potential.&#13;
As is apparent, three of these five criteria coincide with those applied by the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture and Stockraising (MAG).&#13;
Finally, the Directorate of Research, Technology Transfer and Extension has&#13;
drawn up its own list using criteria similar to those detailed above.&#13;
At a meeting organized by the Directorate of Planning to agree on priorities as&#13;
regards crops and livestock, a committee was appointed to harnonize the various criteria used by&#13;
the agencies referred to aad to draw up a definitive and official list for the Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
and Stockraising. The committee was made up of representatives of the Directorates of Planning,&#13;
Agricultural Information and Renewable Natural Resources, and of Research, Technology&#13;
Transfer and Extension.&#13;
The procedure foliowed by the committee in establishing the priorities was to&#13;
compare the three lists available and to rank the crops and livestock in accordance with those&#13;
placing highest in the three lists, while those shown as least priority are those which only featured&#13;
in one of them, plus some others that the committee considered on account of certain factors&#13;
analyzed in the relevant session.&#13;
Attachment 2 sets out the comparative lists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64&#13;
Im    Priority Crops and Livestock&#13;
On the basis of the criteria and procedures agreed upon and the exchange of views&#13;
among the committee members, three priority echelons were established, each of which consists of&#13;
ten products:&#13;
Echelon 1 is mnade up of the following products, in the order shown: rice, coffee,&#13;
potatoes, cocoa, flint maize, soft maize, bovine cattle, bananas and plantains, soybeans and kidney&#13;
beans.&#13;
Echelon 2 is made up of: cassava, wheat, broad beans, peas, barley, cotton,&#13;
regular tomatoes, tree tomatoes, quinoa and swine.&#13;
Echelon 3 comprises: oil palm, sugarcane, naranjilla, apples, guineapigs, mangoes,&#13;
babaco, peaches and lemons.&#13;
Attachment 3 summarizes the factors that determined the selection and&#13;
prioritization of the crops and livestock listed.&#13;
It should be noted that the above list is not exclusive, exhaustive or final, since&#13;
future circumstances may change the order of priorities, or cause some products to be dropped&#13;
and others to be added.&#13;

First Echelon of Priority&#13;
1TEM                                    REASONS&#13;
RICE                  Crop of primary importance for the family shopping baske, with export possibilities but requiring&#13;
technological improvements to increase productivity and reduce costs.&#13;
COFFEE                Export crop, with low unit yields, poor bean quality and oversupply. Rerewal and rehabilitation of&#13;
plantations are warranted m the best areas for the crop, while diversification is called for where it is&#13;
marinal, and also improvemet m the processing of the beans and developmeat of upland coffee.&#13;
COCOA                 Export crop, with good commercial performance, which requires renewal and rehabiiato of the&#13;
plantations and upgrading of bean quality.&#13;
FLINT MAIZE           Basic crop for livestock feed, the main indirect input for obtaining pouty and pig meat, with&#13;
productivity indexes that are still low and good industrial possibilities.&#13;
POTATOES              A widely grown product characterized by oversupply and a family shopping basket staple, with&#13;
productivity indexes that are still low and very susceptible to attack by numerous pests and disases.&#13;
The present type and level of pesticide application are causing toxicity and pollution problems in&#13;
persons and soils, a siuation that requires immediate attention.&#13;
SOFT MAIZE            A crop cultivated in large areas of the upland regions, with low productivity and some industrial&#13;
opporunities. It is an important food staple in the uplands.&#13;
BANANAS AND           Crops that are both exported and consumed domestically in large quantities, susceptible to attack by&#13;
PLANTAINS             senous pests and diseases and which need better management in order to obtain higher pnces in the&#13;
intenmational markets.&#13;
BOVINE CATTLE         Veiy important in tenns of the family shopping basket, as the main source of meat and milk, with&#13;
low yields, good industial and export possibilities and excellent commnercial performance.&#13;
SOYBEANS              Crop of primary importance (as oil) in the family basket, low productivity indexes, good industrial&#13;
and domestic market possibilities and good conmercial performance.&#13;
KIDNEY BEANS          Widely grown crop, a family basket staple, with low productivity indexes and good export&#13;
possibilities.&#13;

ITEM                                    REASONS&#13;
CASSAVA               A very important food staple in the coastal and eastern regions, with excellent industrial possibilities&#13;
and good export prospects.&#13;
WHEAT                 A very important food staple, mostly imported, and requiring better technological experbise to&#13;
improve its productivity and return.&#13;
BROAD BEANS           Legumes, of good nutritional content, an important foodstuff especially for rural dwellers, with&#13;
excellet possibilities for increasing their productivity and return and very good conmnercial&#13;
performance.&#13;
PEAS                  Legumes, very important in the family shopping basket, with excellent potential for increasing their&#13;
productivity and very good commercial performance.&#13;
BARLEY                An important food staple for the rual upland population, with considerable possibilities for&#13;
industrial processing and export as a processed product (beer) and good commercial perfonnance.&#13;
COTTON                A basic input for the country's textile ixustry, very susceptible to pests, good commercial&#13;
performance.&#13;
REGULAR               An important product in the family shopping basket, with well developed industial processing; their&#13;
TOMATOES              cultivation suffers from excessive pesticide use and urgent adjustments are needed to preserve the&#13;
populations health.&#13;
TREE TOMATOES         A fnait with excellent vitamin content and medicinal properties; very good export possibilities but&#13;
presently involving serious health problems. Excellent commercial performance.&#13;

69&#13;
Third Echelon of Priority&#13;
1TEM                                    REASONS&#13;
OILPALM               An industrial crop, of prinary importance for the family basket (oil) and with good export&#13;
possibilities. The producers are well organized and marketing is running smooily, so this crop&#13;
should require little public attention.&#13;
SUGARCANE             The private sector being well organized and efficient, than occasional political support is needed&#13;
from the public sector.&#13;
NARANJILLA            A fnut that is very important for the economy of the regions, the naranjilla needs research and&#13;
etension to combat pests and diseases.&#13;
APPLES                A frnit crop whose quality can be upgraded, leading to fewer imports.&#13;
GUINEAPIGS            Small domestic animals widely raised by the low-income rural population in the upland regions, of&#13;
great nutritional value and offering considerable commercial prospects.&#13;
MANGOES               A tropical fruit with good export possibilities.&#13;
PEANUTS               An oil seed with good commercial performance and highly esteened by the imabitants of the coastal&#13;
regions.&#13;
BABACO                A subtropical fruit with good export potential.&#13;
PEACHES               Quality improvement could have the effect of reducing imports of this fruit and appreciably&#13;
increasing the returns obtainable from it in certain upland provinces.&#13;
LEMONS                This crops susceptibility to pests and diseases warrants continued assistance.&#13;
