INDONESIA&#13;
SECOND VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
1. PROJECT BACKGROUND&#13;
A. POVERTY TRENDS&#13;
1.1    Good overall poverty reduction. Indonesia has been successful in reducing the incidence of&#13;
absolute poverty. The percentage of the population living at or below the absolute poverty level was&#13;
reduced from some 40% in 1976 to some 15% in 1990. By 1993, the incidence was estimated at about&#13;
14%, but in view of the large population, about 189 million, the number of absolute poor remains high:&#13;
some 26 million people. These estimates result with an absolute poverty line defined as enabling&#13;
personal intakes of 2,100 calories per day and minimum non-food necessities. Poverty incidence is&#13;
sensitive to the definition used, as many people still are just above the absolute line and would be&#13;
categorized as poor with less stringent standards. (Besides, there are many difficulties in measuring&#13;
poverty-identifying and imputing values to non-traded goods, considering price level differentials&#13;
across locations; identifying differing needs by location, type of employment, household size, age, public&#13;
infrastructure availability. etc., identifying pockets of poverty not apparent to outsiders from statistical&#13;
averages for larger areas. and so on.) The average disposable household income is only about a dollar&#13;
per day per person, even though the average GNP per capita has steadily grown to about $900 equivalent.&#13;
1.2    Poverty, predominantly rural. There is no doubt that poverty is an important rural problem.&#13;
Poverty reduction has been most remarkable in rural areas, but still, some 17 million poor remain in rural&#13;
areas, many on marginal uplands, water scarce or remote areas, or coastal fishing villages, or areas too&#13;
densely populated to enable a living from the resulting small farms, while alternative sources of income&#13;
are still scant. Rapid urbanization has absorbed many rural poor. Nevertheless the estimated number of&#13;
urban poor has decreased somewhat, to some 9 million in 1993. These numbers reflect a similar urban&#13;
and rural absolute poverty incidence; other data, such as on infant mortality, suggest that the rural&#13;
poverty incidence may be higher.&#13;
1.3    Most poor are on Java and Sumatra. Java, with a population of 112 million of which some&#13;
40% are in urban areas (in 1993), has one of the highest population densities in the world, of about 8&#13;
persons per hectare. Java has some 60% of Indonesia's population on only some 7% of the country's&#13;
land area. In the 1990s all the population growvth took place in the urban areas. In line with its share of&#13;
the population, Java has the most poor, some 56% of the total, some 15 million. Of Java's absolute poor,&#13;
almost 60% or some 8.2 million live in rural villages. The povertv incidence in rural areas is about 12%,&#13;
slightly lower than the national average. Sumatra is the second most populous island, comprising some&#13;
40 million persons with 72% of them living in rural areas-28 million. Sumatra has some 20% of the&#13;
country's poor, or 5 million. The number of "absolute poor" in rural areas is estimated at about 4&#13;
million, at a 13% incidence. Java and Sumatra rural poor-14 million-thus comprise 70% of&#13;
Indonesia's rural poor, or 50% of the urban plus rural poor (of the total number of poor, Kalimantan&#13;
comprises 8%, Sulawesi 5%, Bali 1%, and the other islands, 1-3%; these shares are lower even though&#13;
poverty incidences are higher in some outer island provinces than on Java and Sumatra). Details are in&#13;
Annex I Table 1.&#13;
1.4    Bank poverty reviews.  The Bank has prepared tvo reviews of the poverty situation in&#13;
Indonesia: "Strategy for a Sustained Reduction in Poverty", in 1990, and "Public Expenditures, Prices&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project         - 2 -                        September 13, 1996&#13;
and the Poor", in 1993. The latter report has been an input to the Government's current poverty&#13;
programs, on which this proposed project also builds. The Bank is further analyzing the 1993 SUSENAS&#13;
and SAKERNAS data for poverty implications, and a consistent message comes out: most poor are&#13;
dependent on agriculture.&#13;
B. PAST AND ONGOING POVERTY RELATED PROGRAMS&#13;
1.5    Past programs. Steady economic growth, of 6% per year over more than a decade by now, has&#13;
been a main contributor to poverty reduction in Indonesia. In addition to growth, govemnment goals&#13;
continue to include stability and equity. As part of its policy the Government has emphasized regional&#13;
development programs, with focus on agriculture and food self-sufficiency; socially oriented programs,&#13;
such as universal primary education, family planning, community health and nutrition; public&#13;
infrastructure development, including water supply, roads, electricitv; village development programs,&#13;
credit programs, and more. The programs aimed at providing basic levels of services for all, and were&#13;
funded yearly through the central government budgets; international agencies provided assistance to&#13;
somne of the programs. Given the overall low income levels prevailing, the Government did not generally&#13;
try to "target" the poor; also, given the overall low technical skills, the Government kept most planning&#13;
and implementation in central agencies. Steps are being taken to improve planning and implementation&#13;
of supply driven, basic standards, types of public programs that continue to be much needed. Also, as&#13;
both incomes and income differentials have increased, programs are increasingly targeted-such as&#13;
urban poverty, kampung improvement programs (KIP), and the integrated area development schemes&#13;
(PKT').  They are also increasingly developed and implemented with local level agencies and&#13;
community participation.&#13;
1.6    Large revenue transfers. Central government transfers to local levels will continue to be&#13;
importanut for equity objectives, because the central government has most tax bases (oil, gas, import&#13;
duties. etc.). Most transfer categories are based on equal amounts per capita, per jurisdiction and per&#13;
area size of the jurisdictions. Many of the transfers are eaninarked for specific uses, such as civil service&#13;
salaries, but one of Repelita VIs aims is furthering decentralization of functions, increasing participation&#13;
in decision making at local levels, and increasing targeting of programs by type and by region.&#13;
Decentralization will continue a-s local agencies become more able; the central agencies are&#13;
overwhelmed by the workloads imposed bv growing budgets and complexity that often result in delaying&#13;
program implementation unnecessarilv. The FY1994/95 budget for regional development was Rp.5,340&#13;
billion, comprising Rp.423 billion in transfers to villages (only Rp.6 million per village), transfers to&#13;
kabupatens of Rp.2,418 billion (of which Rp.968 billion for roads), transfers to provinces of Rp.1,219&#13;
billion, subsidies to primary schools of Rp.498 billion, subsidies to health centers of Rp.393 billion, and&#13;
the IDT program with Rp.389 billion. At the samne time, local revenue efforts are promoted as local&#13;
needs exceed available budgets.&#13;
1.7   IDT Program.  The Government launched its innovative IDT program, the "Inpres Desa&#13;
Tertinggal", in April 1994. It is funded domestically with some $200 million equivalent per year for&#13;
three years and has been widely publicized. It is targeted to more than 25,000 poor villages (see para.&#13;
1.8) that each receives some $10,000 equivalent seed capital, for the poorer villagers. The poor get&#13;
access to working capital. at low cost and in a simple and transparent way. Standard government&#13;
agencies are bypassed but "facilitators" (community workers) paid by the Government are available to&#13;
GOIEs area development scheme (PKT) was undertaken during 1989-93 and covered for one year each a total&#13;
of 7,900 villages, mainlv for public infrastnrcture provision with village participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project        - 3 -                        September 13, 1996&#13;
assist villagers in understanding the program, and in defining "projects". Communitv self-help groups&#13;
(POKMAS) are central to the IDT process. The villagers agree on who should be the beneficiaries of the&#13;
funds, based on low incomes and proposed productive uses of the funds; the beneficiaries have to repay&#13;
the "village", as the funds are intended to become a revolving fund for others to use subsequently. The&#13;
subdistrict bank unit receives the grant from the Government in a village account and disburses against a&#13;
minimum of documentation to the village head and the beneficiaries, and forwards records to the&#13;
Govemment. The village heads also have to keep records of beneficiaries and activities pursued,&#13;
repayments, etc., records that are consolidated at the provincial level and fonvarded to Jakarta. IDT&#13;
results so far appear to be positive. Villagers surveyed say they value the initiative. Funds are being&#13;
used carefully-even so, sometimes the "business" fails. Also, some cases of misappropriation of funds&#13;
by officials have been reported (some of them via the "P.O. Complaints Box 5000", that is well known to&#13;
the Indonesian population). Strong action-dismissal-has been taken against a nLlniber of identified&#13;
offenders. Japan's Policy and Humnan Resources Development Fund approved in Januarv 1995 a $2&#13;
million equivalent grant to BAPPENAS to monitor/supervise/evaluate the IDT pilot during 1995-1997,&#13;
using the systems partially developed under a Bank-financed studv. Thle monitoring is undervay within&#13;
MoHA, and should assist in defining future poverty reduction programs.&#13;
1.8    The selection of villages for the IDT program is made by the National Development Planning&#13;
Agency (BAPPENAS) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) based on the PODES socioeconomic&#13;
survey by the Central Bureau of Statistics. The 1994 selection considered three basic indicators: village&#13;
facilities and potential (10 variables), housing and the environmlent (8 variables) and population&#13;
characteristics (9 variables). Of the 65.554 villages in Indonesia, 20.633 had at least 2 of the 3 indicators&#13;
below the set poverty threshold and were thus defined as "poor". The large majority (95%) of these poor&#13;
villages are "rural". The village selection had some flaws for identifying consumption levels-for&#13;
instance, too much weight was given to infrastructure deficiencies that do not always reflect lowest&#13;
consumption levels-and thus the selection for the 1995 progranm gave more prominence to expenditure&#13;
levels; furthermore, villages with less than 50 families received the IDT allocation onlv once: those with&#13;
50 to 100 families receive the grant twice. As a result. almost a third of the villages selected in 1994&#13;
changed for the 1995 program. A list of the poor rural villages in Indonesia shows that Java has some&#13;
30% or 5400 of them, but that they comprise more than 52% or I5 million of the population in poor rural&#13;
villages, as the village size, some 2800 persons, is twvice the national average. Sumatra has some 35% or&#13;
6600 of the poor rural villages, but their average size of some 900 persons is less than the national&#13;
average, so that their population is some 6 million. Thus. Java and Sumatra have more than 60% of the&#13;
poor villages and more than 70% of the population in poor villages. Details are in Annex I Table 2.&#13;
C. RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
1.9    Large scope works. The Government has concentrated investment on infrastructure in projects&#13;
of national, provincial and district level importance. Projects at these levels usually have a large number&#13;
of beneficiaries and high economic returns. In the case of roads, such projects are necessary to improve&#13;
or create basic networks that carry high traffic volume, and thus normally have priority over subdistrict&#13;
or village access roads. As a result the road network currently comprises some 260,000 km of which&#13;
some 189,000 km are kabupaten (district) roads. However access roads are not well developed, and&#13;
given heavy rains and difficult terrain and clayish soils in many locations, many villages are cut off&#13;
during the rainy season. Extending the road network to provide all weather 'hough low standard access&#13;
to villages is now a priority, but because of the large number of villages it is costly even if improvements&#13;
are achieved at lowest possible costs.  The road subsector already comprises sonic 20%  of the&#13;
development budget (some Rp.4,530 trillion in FY95), and some reallocations may be warranted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project          - 4 -                       September 13, 1996&#13;
between networks and types of expenditures as recommended in the Bank Road Sector Study (Report no.&#13;
15394-IND).&#13;
1.10   Small scope works. Infrastructure needs at the subdistrict and village level have been addressed&#13;
with smaller government programs and with self-help. Since Repelita IV, the Government has classified&#13;
villages in 3 categories for assistance: the poorest, to which both housing and public infrastructure&#13;
assistance are given; villages with potential, such as rural growth centers that need ad-hoc programs, and&#13;
villages already developing, for which only housing assistance is provided. The Ministry of Home&#13;
Affairs (and until 1993 also the Ministry of Public Works) helps implement the programs. By 1996&#13;
about half the villages have been provided some assistance; some 3,000/4,000 villages selected at the&#13;
kabupaten level are assisted every year. There have also been special programs such as the integrated&#13;
area development scheme (mentioned in para. 1.5). Currently INPRES provides some Rp.50 million per&#13;
kabupaten for village infrastructure. Most work is undertaken by the villagers, without pay or paid just&#13;
enough to cover some training and food costs, so that more funds are available to purchase inputs. A site&#13;
engineer, often a consultant, is assigned for 2-3 months to a village to help witlh implementation, if&#13;
needed. The Army's "corps of engineers" equivalent has also been active in improving small village&#13;
infrastructures.  Often villagers improve infrastructure by themselves-under the -gotong royong"&#13;
system all villagers mobilize one day to accomplish a chosen task, or each villager is assigned&#13;
responsibility for completing by a certain date a given sub-task, such as improvement of a small road&#13;
section. But villagers usually cannot afford to buy materials such as stone, so despite their efforts,&#13;
results are often of low standard and short-lived. Thus, infrastructure service levels remain low. A 1994&#13;
study sponsored by OECF estimated that providing for basic infrastructure "needs" (access roads, piers,&#13;
drinking water, sanitation) in all the poor Indonesian villages, at Ministry of Public Works unit costs,&#13;
would cost Rp.2,757 billion. The GOI has started in FY96 a national "poros desa" program through&#13;
INPRES 11, to provide access to clusters of IDT villages using a combination of community and&#13;
contractors for implementation.&#13;
1.11   Recent/ongoing village infrastructure projects. Mid-1995, 2 village infrastructure projects&#13;
were started to assist poor villages; OECF focusing on villages "with potential" off-Java, the Bank&#13;
focusing on the poorest villages on Java (and Madura). The OECF-assisted project provides variable&#13;
amounts per village, depending on the cost of identified subprojects that may be of subdistrict scale and&#13;
may serve various villages (such as a kabupaten road section). It has the local public works department&#13;
in charge of implementation through contractors. The Bank assisted Village Infrastructure Project (VIP,&#13;
Ln.3888-IND) provides each of 1,200 villages, the bottom 6% of the Javanese villages, with a Rp.120&#13;
million grant. Completion of both projects is expected by early 1997. The 1994 OECF study identified&#13;
needs totaling Rp.965 billion on Sumatra and Rp.312 billion on Java, and thus the 2 projects cover only a&#13;
small share of the villages and the needs. OECF proposes to assist another project also starting in 1997,&#13;
off Java and Sumatra. The proposed VIP II Bank-assisted project, is to provide village infrastructures on&#13;
Java and Sumatra.&#13;
2. PAST BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.1    Overall poverty reduction experience. This paragraph summarizes a number of important&#13;
general lessons learned. Details on the VIP are in the next paragraphs. The VIP SAR (Report no. 13776-&#13;
IND) provides details on other past project experiences. A general lesson is that for poverty reduction&#13;
programs, involvement of the intended beneficiaries in program design and implementation, and their&#13;
contribution in kind or cash are essential for more relevant subproject choices and sustainability. Also,&#13;
multilayered top-down processes and centralized approval requirements considerably slow processes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project        - 5 -                        September 13, 1996&#13;
down and add to overhead costs; however, central criteria and guidelines are useful, as is the availability&#13;
of technical expertise and advice at the local level to improve understanding of choices and quality of&#13;
implementation. The start-up period tends to be longer than planned, and programs need some flexibility&#13;
in implementation time-unless the opportunity cost of their time is nil, people generally need time to&#13;
choose and commit to a new activity, and need some certainty about the sustainability of the initiative.&#13;
Starting small and expanding programs as demand for them increases at each location seems a safe way&#13;
to proceed.&#13;
2.2    Village Infrastructure Project. The VIP provides assistance to 1,200 villages on Java and&#13;
Madura, with a Rp.120 million grant to each village. In 1993 the Government identified villages "left&#13;
behind", or poor, largely based on infrastructure deficiencies (having at least 2 of 3 indicators below the&#13;
PODES poverty threshold). The VIP assists the bottom fifth of the identified poor villages on Java,&#13;
including the 765 villages categorized as "extremely poor". The first year program included 415&#13;
villages, 120 in West Java, 145 in Central Java, 30 in Yogyakarta and 120 in East Java. The Project&#13;
Management Unit under the Coordination Team for village infrastructure (P3DT) first identified the&#13;
kabupatens (districts) in each province with the highest concentration of poorest villages: 23 of the 82&#13;
kabupaten on Java include about half of the "extremely poor" villages. Because of the need to limit the&#13;
time consultant field engineers spend traveling between villages, villages are selected in clusters of 5,&#13;
each cluster including at least 3 extremely poor villages. All selected villages have populations of at&#13;
least 700 persons, to justify the infrastructure and the grant level.&#13;
2.3    The VIP concept is innovative for the Bank in the extent of its decentralization/grassroot&#13;
approach: the villages selected choose the works they want and that comply with simple economic&#13;
criteria; technical assistance is provided directly to the villages; financing is provided directly through&#13;
subdistrict bank units and delinked from late budget releases. The focus is also on employment:&#13;
villagers doing the work are paid cash in proportion to work progress and works are organized seasonally&#13;
or as convenient for labor availability. Normally, on the other hand, Bank infrastructure projects in&#13;
Indonesia are implemented via govemment agencies because the works are of a larger scale and&#13;
complexity, and while so far the Govermment has had some village programs implemented at the&#13;
subdistrict and even village level, generally district or higher level agencies are fully in charge and&#13;
village laborers are often not paid in cash but expected to contribute "free" labor.&#13;
2.4   Implementation started in mid-1995, and despite the new procedures involved, it experienced&#13;
minimum delays. The first year program was 90% complete by January 1996 when the mid-term review&#13;
was conducted. In 415 villages, a total of 1,334 km of roads, 3.2 km of bridges, 901 communal water&#13;
units, 532 communal sanitary units and I jetty will have been built by village labor assisted by field&#13;
consultant engineers, at a cost of some $22 million. The 90% completion involved almost 5.5 million&#13;
labor-days, of which 4.9 million was by unskilled labor. Some 112,200 persons worked on and off on&#13;
the projects, of whom 91% were men, 9% women and 31% youth. By their own reckoning, about 65%&#13;
were "poor" (a very relative measure, since in even the poorest of villages those better off (poor by&#13;
accepted standards) did not consider themselves "poor" given poorer people in the village). Daily&#13;
incentive payments for unskilled laborers varied between Rp.2,000 and 7,000, the latter for 2 shifts per&#13;
day. The main concem was quality of works, in particular road works, as villagers emphasized quantity&#13;
over quality within the financial possibilities of the grant. If infrastructures are maintained, as per the&#13;
village agreements, then the high savings already experienced should be sustainable-some transport&#13;
costs were more than halved, as did some water supply costs. CARE and the BPS undertook field&#13;
surveys for their monitoring assignments. The CARE draft report shows subproject selection and&#13;
incentive payments were acceptable to the majority of villagers and that the project has been greatly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project        - 6 -                        September 13, 1996&#13;
appreciated. The BPS report has been prepared and is being reviewed. By April 1996 the first year&#13;
program was completed.&#13;
2.5    During implementation of the first year VIP, the Bank and the IDT Secretariat staff, often&#13;
accompanied by other central and local agency staff, have conducted joint supervision missions every 3-&#13;
4 months to samples of villages. A total of some 100 villages (about 25%) were visited at various stages&#13;
of progress, and in each village the project documentation was reviewed for consistency with the project&#13;
rules, with the works on the ground, with payments to laborers, with the records at the BRI unit, with the&#13;
Pimpro, and more broadly, with the monthly project report. By the sampling method, normally random&#13;
and only 1 village from a cluster (of 5), the supervision missions have met with all field engineers (and&#13;
presumably all villages under one field engineer follow similar standards). Also provincial agencies&#13;
audited the grant use near the end of the fiscal year, before the audits were due.&#13;
2.6    Measures were taken to improve the quality of works in the 1996 program; the fact that works&#13;
can start earlier in the year, and take place mostly in the dry season, will also improve their quality.&#13;
From a "long list" of IDT villages prepared by BAPPENAS, local agencies selected 810 villages,&#13;
covering all kabupatens, for the 1996 program-more villages than envisaged could be included due to&#13;
depreciation of the rupiah and to savings in the cost of technical assistance, partly because the works&#13;
programs will be complete in 2 rather than the 3 years allowed in the SAR (the monitoring activities will&#13;
continue into the third year). Additional field engineer consultants were trained, the Project Manual has&#13;
been enhanced, the Ministry of Finance and Bank Rakyat Indonesia inputs are on schedule, the works&#13;
were being planned in the villages already in February-March: there is much anticipation regarding the&#13;
project. The success of the VIP resulted in the Government wanting to extend the scheme and request&#13;
the proposed project. By July 1996, works were underway in most project villages and completion is&#13;
expected by end-October 1996.&#13;
2.7    Related to the project, the Govemment is to review ways to improve the farm gate prices to&#13;
fanners, by reviewing local regulations and taxation, and non-competitive practices, by assessing ways to&#13;
make better information available to farmers to enhance their marketing possibilities, etc. However, the&#13;
process of change is bound to take more time than the 2 years of project works implementation, as it&#13;
involves several sectors and must be sensitive to regional variations.&#13;
2.8    Bank poverty strategy. The proposed project, along with its ongoing predecessor, is in the&#13;
forefront of implementing the objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy. It is geographically&#13;
targeted to reduce poverty, in the poorest villages; it will improve quantity and quality of infrastructure&#13;
services, delivered in a less costly and more reliable manner and responsive to local demand, while&#13;
ensuring good social and environmental practices. It is eminently of a beneficiary participatory nature.&#13;
Furthermore, it will increase the economic base of the beneficiary villages, promoting economic growth.&#13;
(Italics denote 1996 CAS objectives).&#13;
2.9    Rationale for Bank involvement. The Bank endorses the Government strategy for poverty&#13;
reduction in Indonesia (para. 3.1). The Bank also has as one of its main objectives the reduction of&#13;
poverty, and given the lessons and experience and generally good results from VIP, it is reasonable that&#13;
the Bank contribute to an expanded VIP program even if there are little foreign costs involved.&#13;

Second Village Infrastructure Project      - 7 -                      September 13, 1996&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORIGIN AND FORMULATION&#13;
3.1    Poverty reduction objectives. The Govemment has made further poverty reduction one of its&#13;
main objectives in the Five Year Plan (Repelita VI) that started in April 1994. It is concemed that the&#13;
number of poor remains large and wants to accelerate the process of reducing poverty. It aims at&#13;
decreasing poverty incidence to 6%, less than 15 million persons, by the year 2000. The main&#13;
instruments foreseen to achieve this objective are an outward oriented, labor-intensive based economic&#13;
growth (expected to generate more than 2 million new jobs per year); human resource development&#13;
(especially expanded education and health programs); and continuing programs targeted to poor villages&#13;
and their linkages to urban markets.&#13;
3.2    Client commitment. In 1995 the Govenrnent requested that the Bank assist with the project. It&#13;
already has a Project Management Unit, that is in charge of the ongoing VIP. The proposed project&#13;
would start at the end of the VIP works, scheduled for December 1996, and the established PMU would&#13;
carry on. There is a very high level of commitment to the project at all levels, given that it helps&#13;
implement the Govemment's poverty reduction program that is currently a high priority, promoted by&#13;
the President himself.&#13;
3.3    Project preparation. The experience from the VIP is straightforward for the proposed project&#13;
on Java, with many more poor villages in need of local public infrastructure. For Sumatra, joint reviews&#13;
and field trips by Government and Bank staff, and by consultants, clarified that the VIP concept was not&#13;
only well suited, despite the lower population densities and occasionally more difficult terrain, but was&#13;
also in considerable demand already in early 1996. Local govemments and villages preferred the VIP's&#13;
village-led approach to OECF's contractor-led implementation.  The proposed project will thus&#13;
complement the predecessor OECF project on Sumatra, and continued OECF support to the outer&#13;
islands.&#13;
3.4   The project was developed jointly by the Govenmment and the Bank. BAPPENAS in particular,&#13;
its Bureau of Regional District and Rural Development and the PMU/P3DT Secretariat, coordinated&#13;
interaction with other relevant Ministries, in particular the Directorate General of Regional Development&#13;
(Bangda) and the Directorate General of Village Community Development (PMD) in the Ministry of&#13;
Home Affairs; the Directorate General of Human Settlements (Cipta Karya) and of Roads (Bina Marga)&#13;
in the Ministry of Public Works; and the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.5   The proposed project is classified as a targeted poverty reduction intervention. The main&#13;
objective is to build small infrastructures in poor rural villages on the two islands where most of&#13;
Indonesia's poor are, Java (including Madura) and Sumatra. This also creates cash employment for&#13;
villagers-the population in 2600 poor villages totals some 5 million. Secondary objectives are to&#13;
increase decentralization and community participation. The instrument is grants and engineering&#13;
assistance to 2600 poor villages to plan and build public infrastructure by themselves; i.e. the process&#13;
itself matters, as described in the next section. Incomes are low, some only $1 per day per capita: the&#13;
broadest objective is to reduce rural poverty. This would be met from the temporary income, and some&#13;
work experience, generated by project implementation, and from the more permanent income increases&#13;
&#13;

C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.6    Summary description. In order to reach the above objectives, the proposed project comprises a&#13;
2 year effort to assist some 2600 poor rural villages on Java and Sumatra improve their living standards&#13;
while building public works-such as access roads, bridges, water supply schemes, sanitation facilities,&#13;
drainage, markets, piers or other small economic infrastructures. The project would essentially be a&#13;
repeater of the Village Infrastructure Project for Java, that assists 1,200 poor villages on Java. It would&#13;
provide a grant (about $50,000 equivalent) to each of 2,600 of the poorest villages on Java and Sumatra&#13;
for building local public infrastructures, from January 1997 to December 1998. The villagers would&#13;
decide what to build, from a menu of choices, and would build it mostly themselves, the workers being&#13;
paid by output. Much of the grant may be used to purchase materials (which are also produced mostly&#13;
through labor intensive methods, though mostly outside the project villages). Some equipment would be&#13;
leased, as necessary, mainly from kabupaten level DPUK pools. Field engineers (consultants) would&#13;
assist the villagers plan and implement the works, while also handling financial aspects, such as&#13;
approvals for the local bank to pay project related bills, and statements to the center for controls and&#13;
funding the local banks for the project needs-the grant is not given up front, except for a Rp.20 million&#13;
advance for materials, but disbursed based on work progress.  Senior engineers and a project&#13;
management unit would be in charge of the overall planning, coordination and implementation&#13;
management. District level bodies would be involved in the selection of villages from a list of poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project         - 9 -                        September 13, 1996&#13;
villages prepared by the Bureau of Statistics following village surveys. The project results would be&#13;
monitored on a yearly sampling basis by local consultants/NGOs.&#13;
3.7    Decentralization.  Decentralization has been built into the project design.  Because the&#13;
"process" is important for the project outcome, it is described below, prior to the description of the&#13;
"components".&#13;
3.8    Poor village selection process. Both the project team and consultants have undertaken field&#13;
surveys during project preparation and appraisal to ensure the suitability of the VIP approach for&#13;
Sumatra. The number of project villages would be 1500 on Java and Madura and 1100 on Sumatra,&#13;
distributed by province such that in each about 50% of the rural IDT villages will have been assisted&#13;
under both VIP projects and the OECF infrastructure project covering Sumatra. With the experience&#13;
gained on Java under VIP, 750 villages can be handled as of the first year under VIP II; on Sumatra,&#13;
based on the OECF assistance level, some 500 villages the first project year in selected kabupatens, and&#13;
600 the second year. A preliminary number of villages by province is in Annex 1 Table 3. The&#13;
provincial BAPPEDAs I will propose the number of project villages by kabupaten; the kabupaten&#13;
BAPPEDAs II, in consultation with the camats (subdistrict heads), will suggest the villages. Kabupatens&#13;
with few village clusters would be assisted one project year only. Village lists were discussed in&#13;
September 1996 for the first project year, and will be proposed no later than September 1, 1997 for the&#13;
second project year. The P3DT Secretariat reviews the proposed village lists for compliance with&#13;
eligibility criteria. In October 1996 PMDs using a checklist and guidelines provided by the P3DT&#13;
Secretariat, will verifyi the village clustering possibilities and for the villages selected, will prepare a&#13;
baseline database. By December 31, 1996 (and December 31, 1997 for the second project year), the&#13;
camats/bupatis will inform the kepala desas (elected village heads) of villages selected and will provide&#13;
public information-a circular, radio announcements, etc.-with the rules to be followed under the&#13;
program, so that discussions in the villages selected get underway.&#13;
3.9    Village selection criteria. To be eligible for the project, villages (a) will be selected from the&#13;
PODES list (para. 1.8); (b) will have at least 700 inhabitants, or in areas having only smaller villages, 2&#13;
or 3 close-by villages totaling at least 700 persons can be considered as one Project village (specifically&#13;
for Aceh); (c) will be located in clusters, expected to comprise 5 villages; (d) will be IDT villages or a&#13;
non-IDT village in a cluster of IDT villages. For equity considerations, priority will be accorded to&#13;
non-transmigration villages, as these have already benefited from other programs. Villages covered in&#13;
some other programs will also be excluded from the project, such as the 134 villages included in the&#13;
Kerinci Seblat Integrated Conservation and Development Project (Ln. 4008-IND), and those assisted&#13;
under the OECF village infrastructure project on Sumatra. Very isolated villages would not be assisted&#13;
given that small infrastructures would not have a significant impact in their accessibility to markets or&#13;
facilities. Villages of indigenous peoples, such as some villages on Nias island, would require a more&#13;
comprehensive approach than that of the project.&#13;
3.10   Grants to villages. The allocations are recorded in the kabupaten budgets but the funds are&#13;
channeled to villages through the subdistrict units of Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI). A flow chart is&#13;
included in Annex 2. Each village grant under the project should ideally reflect infrastructure needs and&#13;
labor availability. However, for simplicity and transparency, the grant is a standard Rp.120 million&#13;
(about $50,000 equivalent). This has been found to be less than the needs of the poor villages, but&#13;
sufficient to stimulate the community to construct beneficial infrastructure; and it allows reaching more&#13;
villages within available funds. If the initial village program tums out to cost less than the grant, then the&#13;
village can select additional works, until no funds remain. Up to 5% of the village grant can be used to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project         - 10 -                        September 13, 1996&#13;
compensate the village leaders, LKMD secretary and work overseers, and to cover administrative&#13;
expenses.&#13;
3.11   Selection of public infrastructure subprojects by villagers. The kepala desa heads the LKMD&#13;
(village community resilience institution) and leads discussions among village group representatives to&#13;
agree on project priorities; IDT program facilitators and other PMD local staff are available to help the&#13;
process. Village proposals are submitted to the camat, for harmonization. if necessary through the&#13;
UDKP (Unit Daerah Karva Pembangunan) at the subdistrict level, and agreed programs are further&#13;
checked to ensure that the proposals are not already covered in another, funded program. Subprojects&#13;
that would normally be included in standard budgets ([NPRES) and normallv larger than those envisaged&#13;
here, are in principle not financed under the project.  Camats endorse the program. subject to a&#13;
satisfactory technical review by the field engineers (see below). The final approval should come no later&#13;
than May 31, 1997 and May 31. 1998, as indicated in the Project Implementation Plan.&#13;
3.12   Field engineers (consultants) first review the subproject proposals pre-approved by camats,&#13;
starting around March. They discuss the subprojects and propose modifications as may be needed for&#13;
technical reasons, and either give their technical (final) approval, or if an alternative subproject were&#13;
selected of a different type and cost estimate, then consult the camat again about the alternative. The&#13;
requirements for approval of a subproject by a consultant field engineer are elaborated in the Project&#13;
Manual; they are listed below and the specifics are recorded in each case, as followvs:&#13;
a)  the subproject must be a public infrastructure, technically and environmentally viable and&#13;
justified by the number of users and the cost per user:&#13;
b)  the funding available-the village grant and any village contributions-must be estimated&#13;
to be sufficient to complete the subproject.&#13;
c)  land requirements will be minimized: for any land or assets requirement that would affect&#13;
negatively a villager's income and require compensation, the village and the affected family&#13;
would agree on compensation that would improve or restore the living standard, income&#13;
earning or production capacity of the affected persons to pre-subproject levels in&#13;
accordance with the agreed Guidelines for Compensation and Resettlement. The field&#13;
engineer verifies that all persons affected and who required compensation are satisfied with&#13;
the compensation provided. prior to the start of works. If no agreement can be reached, an&#13;
altemative location or subproject should be selected and the process, repeated if necessary:&#13;
d)  implementation plan, contractual arrangements, a work plan and number of village laborers&#13;
must be clear; and&#13;
e)  approaches to provide subsequent maintenance of the subproject must be agreed, including&#13;
assignment of responsibilities for maintenance works, training for maintelnance designees.&#13;
and financing, as necessary.&#13;
3. 13  In line with decentralization policies neither the PMU nor the Bank require to approve individual&#13;
subprojects. Normally, kabupaten level staff of PMD/P3DT Secretariat routinely survey villages about&#13;
their infrastructure needs and make the results available as a starting point for proposals by camats and in&#13;
turn by bupatis (Bappeda II level) and by provincial govemors (Bappeda I level), in the yearly bottom-up&#13;
planning process for the budget. This planning consultation process is perused by the project, but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project         - 11 -                       September 13, 1996&#13;
ending essentially at the camat level, in line with current decentralization policies and to leave&#13;
decision-making at the village level for village works.&#13;
3.14   Implementation by villagers. The LKMDs are the implementation agencies of the project.&#13;
Village labor, rather than contractors, implemiient most of the works, especially road works. Villagers are&#13;
willing to work for some Rp.2,000-3,000 per shift, approximately the going minimum wage level. The&#13;
DPUKs act as "administrative" Pimpros for project activity and for recording the financial flows at the&#13;
kabupaten level. To the extent possible. they also help out with advice and provide/lease equipment to&#13;
the LKMDs. The PMD kabupaten and kecamatan levels act as "motivator" for community participation&#13;
and help the LKMD  improve its capabilitv in planning. implementation and maintenance of&#13;
infrastructure constructed by the LKMD.&#13;
3.15   Field engineering assistance to villagers. The project provides engineering services to assist&#13;
directly LKMDs with subproject initial approval. cost estimation, design, procurement, organization and&#13;
supervision of work, reporting, administration and some training to villagers (anid perhaps local&#13;
contractors) for the implementation of the subprojects and subsequent maintenance. Under the VIP it&#13;
was proven that I field engineer consultant can assist 5 villages (I cluster). Field engineers live close to&#13;
their village cluster to reduce travel and have a motorcycle for their transportation. A total of some 250&#13;
engineers for the VIP II first vear villages and 270 for the second year are foreseen. Consultants also&#13;
reviewed the clustering possibilities on Sumatra. where villages are more apart than on Java; their&#13;
findings have confirmed that in most areas, clustering is feasible. Where clustering difficulties so&#13;
require, an assistant may be provided to the field engineer. To strengthen the engineering input, area&#13;
technical coordinators will be included in the field engineer contracts.&#13;
3.16   The Project Manual. The Project Manual developed for VIP will be retained and made widely&#13;
available. It includes guidelines with engineering and environmentally sound standards for small public&#13;
works, adopted from  existing manuals (mainly from  MPW), simple compensation guidelines,&#13;
procurement forms, procedures and reporting to be used by LKMDs, etc. The Project Manual has been&#13;
reviewed and expanded to suit some local conditions on eastern Sumatra, especially swamp areas, where&#13;
road construction may require crib-type foundations and cement or lime soil-stabilization.&#13;
3.17   Central engineering/management assistance. The project framework, work standards, hiring&#13;
of the field engineer consultants and coordination witlh other projects and donors, are done at the central&#13;
level by the interministerial P3DT Secretariat assisted by consultants. In order to provide homogeneity&#13;
across clusters, an engineering/management team with a team leader and one to three senior consultants&#13;
per province assisted, will manage and supervise the project. The senior consultants also assist the P3DT&#13;
Secretariat in the selection of consultant firms from Java and Sumatra for the provision of field&#13;
engineers, in organizing workshops for them, and in launching the project. The team leader and a&#13;
counterpart with clear responsibilities are based in Jakarta, to assist the P3DT in overall management, but&#13;
are expected to be in the field most of their time. The other senior engineers are based in the provinces.&#13;
to be closer to the project villages, and are also assigned a counterpart each, from Bappedas 1, from the&#13;
time they mobilize.&#13;
3. 18   Monitoring assistance. The project also provides for the services of a tean of experts to assist&#13;
the PMU to monitor project implementation and impacts. Monitoring will use participatorv approaches&#13;
to the extent feasible anid will be coordinated with the IDT's own monitoring efforts. Some nonproject&#13;
&#13;

Second Village Infrastructure Project           - 12 -                         September 13, 1996&#13;
villages will also be monitored to compare the results of various types of interventions, such as road&#13;
building under various type of programs, and some VIP villages would be revisited later on. The terms&#13;
of reference agreed for VIP monitoring wvill be used again, with improvements as required based on the&#13;
experience gained.&#13;
D. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
3.19   The project Wxould help finanice (a) village wvorks. and emplovymient up to the agreed grant per&#13;
village, (b) engineerinig services. to help with design and implementation of the sclhcmies at the village&#13;
level and. at the central level, for the Project Maanagement Unit (PMU) to organize and coordinate&#13;
activities, supervise project implementation. and (c) technical assistance to monitor and evaluate project&#13;
impacts.&#13;
3.20   Cost composition.  TleC total cost of the project. summarized in Table 3.1. is cstimated at&#13;
Rp.383.1 billion ($159.6 millioni cquivalenlt).  Technical assistance for implementation support is&#13;
estimated to cost $18.0 million equivalent or about 11% of the project cost: the technical assistance for&#13;
monitorinig and evaluation. likely to be provided by local consultanlts, universities and BPS mav amount&#13;
to some $2.8 millioni or 2% of the project cost. The total base cost for technical assistance is thus&#13;
estimated at $20.8 million equivalent or 13% of the project cost. The direct or indircct foreign cost&#13;
component is small, estimated at some 10-20%  and accountinSg for the foreign, cost component of&#13;
technical assistance services. including vehicles- equipmenit depreciation included in contractors' bills:&#13;
and fuel and asphalt costs. Direct labor costs would exceed 50% of project costs depeniding on the&#13;
wvorks. thouglh the share of total labor costs (including labor in materials delivered) would be higher. The&#13;
standard 10% value added tax will apply to works by contractors and supplicr bills; the total tax amount&#13;
under the project will depend on the proportion of works done by villagers themiiselves. Administration&#13;
costs are included at standard percenitages (I % for central Governmenit, 1% for provincial agencies and&#13;
3% for local level agencies, of the grant amounts). Continigencies have been included for technical&#13;
assistancc: because of the programmatic nature. village allocations do not carry contingenicies.&#13;
3.21   Bank financing. The Bank loan of $140.1 million equivalent would finance 88% of project&#13;
costs. The high financinig percentage is on account of the poverty reductionl objectives of the project and&#13;
the fact that the Government is financinig other poverty reductioni programs o01 its own. The Governmenlt&#13;
woould cover 10°/ of thc village grawts. and the fiull increased administration costs. The 10% 0value added&#13;
tax on techinical assistance contracts has been wvaived in accordance with PP42/95.&#13;

4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT COORDINATION AND MONITORING&#13;
4.1    Coordination. The VIP set-up will continiue for this project. BAPPENAS_ in particular its&#13;
Bureau of District and Rural Devclopment. will be the overall coordinating agency of the project. A&#13;
Project Management Unit (PMU/P3DT) has bcen established to oversee imiplementationi and includes&#13;
representatives of BAPPENAS, the Ministry of Finance. DGs Cipta KarNa and Bina Marga (MPW) and&#13;
DGs Bangda and PMD (MoHA). The PMU has a Secretariat (P3DT Secretariat) established to deal with&#13;
the Government's IDT poverty programii as well as related foreign-assisted village infrastructure&#13;
programs. The P3DT Secretariat for the VIP is supported by the leader of the engineer/management&#13;
teamn and consultants for sociocconomic moniitoring; this arrangement will also coIItiItnlu uLnder the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
4.2    Monitoring. The P3DT Secrctariat, with the assistance of experts. would monitor the impact of&#13;
the program in selected villages durinig imiplemenitation and prepare an ex-post evaluation. Monitorers&#13;
are expected to be Indonesian entities such as uLiversities. NGOs or consultants. Furthlemnore, the&#13;
monitoring of the IDT program with the grant from the Governmcit of Japan, will be coordiniated with&#13;
the monitorinig of this project, and somiec villages included in other programs or with no program will be&#13;
monitored as well in order to ascertain differenices. Terms of reference were agreed for VIP and will be&#13;
reviewed as necessary. The VIP It monitoring fimi should be selected by about July 1997.&#13;
4.3    Bappedas levcl I (provincial) provide counterparts to the senior engineers and will monitor&#13;
infonriation about the project. Bappedas level 11 will ensure project coordinationi with other government&#13;
programs at the kabupatcn level.  PMD will assist in the selectioni of villages up front, in the&#13;
strengthening of LKMDs, in the facilitation of consultation process, and in molnitoring.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
4.4    Yearly implementation. To achieve the objectives of the project. to maximlize local villagers&#13;
emplovymient for cash of and provision of local public infrastructure. the works would be executed mainly&#13;
during the dry season, from the beginning of May to end of September. wvhichi is wlhcin farmers are not&#13;
fullv employed in agricultural activities, when conditions are best for construction of public works, and&#13;
before standard public work budgets are released. Yearly project activities are scheduled around the&#13;
desired implementation season. An optimal yearly schedule is in Annex 3-the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan. prepared by the PMU following thc experienice unider VIP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project         - 14 -                        September 13, 1996&#13;
4.5    Implementation period. The project works arc to bc implcmented during 1997 and 1998. The&#13;
subprojects in any village are to be conipletcd in one vear. to curtail the time engineering assistance is&#13;
needed. The first VIP project year experience indicated that this is feasible. The impact evaluation will&#13;
proceed in 1999. Thus in all. the project will take about 3 vears. this is about half the execution time of&#13;
other projects, but is realistic given the proposed project characteristics and the experience under VIP.&#13;
C. IMPLEMENTATION OF WORKS&#13;
4.6    Implementation  agencies.   LKMDs will be tihc 'implementationi agencies" of village&#13;
subprojects. following agreements signed by the caniat and field engineer. LKMDs will serve as&#13;
contractors; they would either employ villagers directly and buy materials, rent equipment, etc. or if need&#13;
be, contract work or expertise with local contractors/technical experts. This procedure has already been&#13;
used successfully. Normally the local implementing agency is the DPUK but DPUKs have limited&#13;
capabilities and would be unable to implement the proposed project with their current staff. Thus,&#13;
DPUK Pimpros will delegate the technical and field wNork to the consultant field engineers, and retain an&#13;
administrative role onlv. Where DPUK engineers are able to help they are of course welcome to do so.&#13;
As stated in the Project Implementationi Plan, Pimpros will be selected in February 1997 and February&#13;
1998. The Pimpro appointment letter should be signed no laterthan April 1. 1997 and April 1, 1998.&#13;
4.7    Field engineers. The field cngineers will assist the LKMDs design, cost, plan, implement and&#13;
supervise works and prepare reports. They certify paymilent documentation in accordance with progress&#13;
of work. Field engineers will be trained in project specifics by the central team assisted by staff from&#13;
BAPPENAS, MoHA. MPW and MoF. at workslhops in the provinces, prior to deployment. They have&#13;
the Project Manual with guidelines for choice of unit price or lump sum contracts, preparation of bill of&#13;
quantities or set of unit prices (depending on1 direct labor or subcontract). teclinical specifications to be&#13;
enforced, including environmental guidelines. quality standards, control activities and other aspects.&#13;
Special care is needed in the costiilg of subprojects given that there are no funds to cover any cost&#13;
overrun beyond the village grant. The project design foresees that each engineer will assist 5 villages;&#13;
this was proven adequate on Java under the VIP. but if necessary under the proposed project, an assistant&#13;
may help the field engineers in more -'dispersed" clusters. A provincial senior engineer, from the core&#13;
team, is available to advise and to supervise progress in the field. Given the large number of villages,&#13;
kabupaten level supervisors and coordinating engineers will also be available to assist the field&#13;
engineers.&#13;
4.8    Village labor. Under VIP and in surveys villagers have indicated willingness to work for low&#13;
"incentive payments" provided the works benefit their village and are seen as a public project. The pay&#13;
should not be so high as to attract laborers away from similarly paying activities they would otherwise&#13;
undertake, since that would not create employment; the wage should be low enough for the poor to self-&#13;
select for the project works. If more villagers want to work than the works canl absorb (normally the case&#13;
under VIP), an agreement is reached in the village as to number of days each interested villager would&#13;
work and when. The agreement would be reviewed by the field engineer for approval of the subproject.&#13;
Unskilled village labor get a lump sum for the task, paid periodicallv by output. This results in some&#13;
Rp.2,000/3,000 equivalent for a 5-6 hour day of work. This is generally accepted minimum local level&#13;
wages; villagers would incur no transportation cost nor costs for food away from home. A village&#13;
foreman (mandor) would be designated by the LKMD for each subproject and be assisted by the field&#13;
engineer; skilled labor will also be hired as needed, at locallv competitive wages. Organizing workers is&#13;
an important part of project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project         - 15 -                        September 13, 1996&#13;
4.9    NGOs. Indonesia has a large number of NGOs-many are present at the subdistrict level and&#13;
some are active in village programs.  NGOs are welcome to contribute to implementation of the&#13;
proposed project; they could assist villages with community participation in subproject selection and&#13;
employment plans. NGOs and universities are engaged under VIP for project monitoring and evaluatiolln&#13;
they are also engaged under a Japanese Grant to monitor and evaluate the IDT program on a sample basis&#13;
in all provinces in 1996 and 1997. It is expected that NGOs/universities will also participate in the&#13;
bidding under VIP 11 for the rapid rural appraisals and that BPS will again assist with other impact&#13;
monitoring aspects (para. 4.30).&#13;
4.10   Project implementation plan. The steps required by each agency as wvell as their timinig are&#13;
well established under the VIP. An agreed implementation plan is included in Anniex 3. Some of the&#13;
salient steps are:&#13;
a)  inform villages of their selection. December 3 1. 1996 and December 3 1 1997 (para. 3.8).&#13;
b)  village work program approval by field enginieers and camnats. May 31. 1 997 and May 3 1&#13;
1998 (para. 3.1 1):&#13;
c)  VIP 11 monitoring firm to be selected by July 1997 (para. 4.2);&#13;
d)  Pimpros designated in Febriary 1997 and 1998 and the appointment letter signed bv April&#13;
30. 1997 and 1998 (para. 4.6);&#13;
e)  shortlist for monitoring consultants to be agreed by December 3 1, 1996 (para. 4.12): and&#13;
f)  invite field engineer firms to submit proposals in December 1996 and finalize selection in&#13;
January 1997 (para. 4.12).&#13;
D. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.11   Bank guidelines. Procurement under the project is required for goods and works and for&#13;
consultant services. Procurement will be in line with Bank procurement guidelines and procedures&#13;
("Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995 and revised in&#13;
January 1996 and 'Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by World Bank&#13;
as Executing Agencv' of August 198 1).&#13;
4.12   Technical assistance.  The engineer/management team, field engineerinig  services, and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation services are procured at the central government level by the P3DT Secretariat.&#13;
Subject to prior review bv the Bank are: consultant contracts with an estimated value of $100.000 or&#13;
more for the engagement of firms, and $50,000 or more for the engagcment of individuals: all tenis of&#13;
reference, and single source selections of consulting firms regardless of contract values. The total cost of&#13;
technical assistance is estimated at $23 million equivalent. The Bank's standard form of Contract for&#13;
Consultants' Services, dated June 1995, will be used. Modalities and status are as follows:&#13;
a)  Engineering/management team. The core senior engineer team of VIP will be retained for&#13;
the project. Agreemllenlt on terms of referenice for additional experts and a sliortlist of firmns&#13;
will be sought between the Bank and P3DT Secretariat. The selection will be based on&#13;
submissions detailing the proposed managemiienit concept, qualification of experts. and&#13;
costs/costs bases for the contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project         - 16 -                       September 13, 1996&#13;
b)  Field engineer services. Under VIP a different firm was hired for each province of West,&#13;
East and Central Java, the latter including Yogyakarta needs, to provide field engineers&#13;
(field engineers could be subcontracted from other firms). The same terms of reference will&#13;
be used; shortlists each comprising about 5 firms will be agreed by December 2. 1996 for&#13;
the Java and Sumatra provinces included in the first year of the proposed project.&#13;
Bappedas I will provide a long list of Indonesian firms. The P3DT Secretariat will invite&#13;
the shortlisted firms to submit proposals in December 1996, and the selection for the first&#13;
project year should be completed in January 1997.&#13;
c)  Monitoring and evaluation services. Terms of reference for monitoring expertise agreed&#13;
for VIP will be retained. Agreement on a shortlist would be sought by December 30, 1996.&#13;
4.13   Subprojects. It is expected that LKMDs will carry out most works by direct village labor&#13;
(community participation, expected to total $120 million) under village implementation agreements with&#13;
the DPUKs. LKMDs may also contract supplies of materials, rental of equipment, and small works by&#13;
local contractors, following national shopping procedures, or procedures for procurement of small works.&#13;
No intemational competitive bidding is envisaged; each LKMD will procure goods and services, and&#13;
such small contracts would not attract international firms. Simplified implementation agreements and&#13;
documentation for national shopping have been agreed to (Annex 4) and are included in the Project&#13;
Manual. National shopping will require at least 3 quotations for each proposed contract. No contract or&#13;
agreement would exceed $50.000 equivalent (the village grant of Rp. 120 million) and most contracts are&#13;
expected to be well below half that amount. All works may be done by community participation;&#13;
nevertheless, procurement under small works procedures may total up to some $5 million (see Table&#13;
4. 1). These procedures are in line with the Indonesian government procurement rules; under Kepres&#13;
16/94. Pimpros can approve, on their own, contracts up to $250,000 equivalent. These procedures are&#13;
acceptable to the Bank and are emploved.in ongoing projects. Field engineers will help the LKMDs, as&#13;
ma' be needed for the community participation works, to: (i) organize village labor including pay&#13;
setting (para. 4.8), (ii) hiring equipment, (iii) purchasing materials and tools; or (iv) contracting out.&#13;
Works would not start until any required compensation for land or assets in the village has been made as&#13;
mentioned in Annex 5 and the Project Manual. Any contractor will be required to use village labor.&#13;
4.14   Prior and post review. Contracts for goods and works of the size envisaged in this project are&#13;
not normally subjected to prior review: it would be impractical given their small amounts and their large&#13;
number. the need for quick approval, and the safeguards built-in in the project design (consultants will be&#13;
in place to assist (field engineers) and to supervise (engineer/management team) the process, and further,&#13;
audits and Bank supervision will be conducted, as well as random ex-post review of SOE&#13;
documentation). Nevertheless, the Bank shall do a prior review in each kabupaten of the first contract,&#13;
for goods and for works under the village implementation agreements, that is valued at or above $10,000&#13;
equivalent. The provincial senior engineer under the project would be responsible for tracking the&#13;
contracts; relatively few contracts above $10,000 are expected. The ex-post review of documentation is&#13;
expected to be similar to that under the first year VIP (see para. 2.5). Based on experience so far, the&#13;
sampling coverage will probably be some 10%, but at least 2% of all contracts will be subject to ex-post&#13;
review.&#13;

E. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.15   Disbursements at local level. For reasons of cost efficiency, the project will pay for output&#13;
(itemized works) against measured progress and prorated lump-sum contracts. Following the procedure&#13;
adopted under the Government's IDT poverty program, by instructions of the Ministry of Finance the&#13;
Bank Rakvat Indonesia (BRI) unit closest to the village will be allowed to disburse the village allocation,&#13;
against withdrawal requests certified by the field engineer.  The field engineer will fornvard the&#13;
implementation agreements (certified by the camat), and contracts to the administrative Pimpro in&#13;
DPUK, who in tum will forward the original to the respective KPKN. LKMDs will be paid at the BR]&#13;
units when presenting their withdrawal requests certified by the field engineer, according to progress of&#13;
works. Village laborers thus would be paid in cash every 2 weeks or weekly. BRA has agreed that its&#13;
units provide access to their LKMD accounts, inter alia to the field engineers and supenrision and audit&#13;
staff. The fund flow is shown in Annex 2.&#13;
4.16   The Bank will not be involved in the approval process of every contract and disbursement at the&#13;
village level, but will inspect contracts at random  during  supervision of the project.   The&#13;
engineering/management team will supervise the subprojects while visiting every project village at least&#13;
once, on behalf of the PMU/P3DT Secretariat.&#13;
4.17   GOI prefinancing. The Government has agreed to make Rp.20 million available per village to&#13;
finance the initial advance and the initial disbursements to the units of BRI, no later than April 30, 1997&#13;
and April 30, 1998. This is required because the Bank cannot have "cascading" advances, at the central&#13;
level and in the provinces. GOI disbursements will be channeled through the regional KPKNs, to the&#13;
respective BRI branches.&#13;
4. 18   As is customary, the Government will also provide its agencies involved in project monitoring or&#13;
management, the administrative/operational budget as required. For this purpose. the additional 5% of&#13;
the total project grant amount will be clearly budgeted for each agencv.&#13;

4.1 9   Bank disbursements. Disbursements uiider the Loan wvould be (i) for expeniditures incurred by&#13;
project villages for goods. works and services unlder grants. at 90%, and (ii) consultant services, at 100%.&#13;
In order to facilitate Bank disbursemenits. the Goveniment would establish a Special Account with an&#13;
amount of up to $14 million (which represent four months eligible expenditure) in Bank Indonesia, and&#13;
an initial deposit of $7 million following loan effectiveness. This account should be maintained by the&#13;
Directorate General of Budget, MoF, following the established procedures. The proposed Special&#13;
AccouLnt would be used for all eligible foreign and local expenditures. Disbursements under the Bank&#13;
loan for village infrastructure expenses wvould be made througlh the existing "force account" mechanism&#13;
(samue as VIP-I) and reimbursed by the Bank loan. Replenishlment applications to the Special Account&#13;
will be made every two weeks or when 20% of the initial deposit has been used, whichever is first.&#13;
Disbursements from  the loani proceeds for the following contracts would be made under full&#13;
documentation: consultant service contracts costing the equivalent of $100,000 or more for firms and of&#13;
$50,000 or more for individual consultants. All other disbursements would be made against Statements&#13;
of Expenditures (SOEs). The documents would be retained by the respective project implementation&#13;
uLits aind made available for review as requested by visiting Bank missions or auditors. The loan will&#13;
not fund any land acquisition or compensation. The disbursement schedule is shown above. The closing&#13;
date of the project is December 31. 1999. A graph with disbursement profiles for Bank loans to&#13;
Indonesia. for VIP and for the proposed project is in Annex 6.&#13;
F. PROJECT ACCOUNTS, REPORTS AND AUDITS&#13;
4.20X   The pro ject allocation per kabupaten would be inscribed in the vearlv local budgets, APBD Tk II,&#13;
SPABP for recording purposes: the administrative-related budgets, will be inscribed for each agency and&#13;
made available timely for field visits, meetings, etc.&#13;
4.21   Monthly reports.  As described in the Project Manual, montlhly project accounts will be&#13;
providcd through various sources:&#13;
a)  field engineers prepare monthly statements, reports and tables on physical progress per type&#13;
of works, value of works, and days worked by village in their cluster, and disbursements&#13;
based on the BRI units' statements, anid submit them to the senior engineer. The statements&#13;
are completed within I week following the month reported on,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project        - 19 -                       September 13, 1996&#13;
b)  the P3DT Secretariat/TA team consolidates the monthly work-related statements of the&#13;
engineers, by kabupaten and province and total, within 3 weeks of the month reported on:&#13;
c)  DGB provides periodically consolidated statements per kabupaten, province and total, for&#13;
reimbursement bv the Bank from the Special Account, and for replenishment of the Special&#13;
Account, copied to the P3DT Secretariat for information; and&#13;
d)  villages keep track of their funds via their own accounts, the BRI statements, and data on&#13;
employment, outputs and remuneration compiled by the kepala desa/field engineer. The&#13;
public posting of this information was not fully complied with under the first year of VIP,&#13;
but was during the second; its enforcement will be given attention under the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
BRI units involved keep records of account deposits from the KPKNs, and disbursements and cumulative&#13;
totals for each project village, and available balances. Their records are available in their offices, but are&#13;
not copied for distribution outside BRI.&#13;
4.22   Other periodic reports. Additional reports will be provided as follows:&#13;
a)  the P3DT Secretariat will prepare quarterly progress reports starting March 31, 1997 and&#13;
annual progress reports by March 31, 1998 and March 31, 1999, including inter alia&#13;
progress per category (roads, water supply. piers, bridges, others; and labor, materials,&#13;
contracts); and&#13;
b)  the DPUK Pimpros keep copy of certified statements to account for expenditures related to&#13;
the APBD Tk II allocations and compile an annual report for Bupatis.&#13;
4.23   Audits. The above reporting system developed under VIP will be continued for the project.&#13;
Agreement was also reached that the consolidated project accounts, including the Special Account and&#13;
the SOEs, would be audited annually by independent auditors in a manner satisfactory to the Bank and&#13;
that the audit report would be furnished to the Bank no later than September 30, each year commencing&#13;
in 1998. The P3DT Secretariat will undertake project account audits. The SOE audits will be the&#13;
responsibility of the DG Budget (MoF). The Bank has no objection to BPKP conducting the audits.&#13;
Financial audits of SOEs would be conducted randomly, to cover at least 10% of villages. In addition,&#13;
assurances were obtained that independent auditors will be appointed for technical audits of project&#13;
implementation aspects in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. The technical audits will review, inter alia,&#13;
the quantity and quality of works performed. their being in line with related expenditures, and the&#13;
maintenance plans. The financial and technical audits may be made simultaneouslv for the same&#13;
subprojects, and start early to avoid bunching. Terms of reference for the audits will be as under VIP.&#13;
G. LAND ACQUISITION, RESETTLEMENT AND COMPENSATION&#13;
4.24   Minimal land acquisition. As was the experience under VIP, no physical displacement is&#13;
expected to take place under this project. Subprojects requiring displacement would be redesigned to&#13;
avoid resettlement or altemative subprojects, proposed. The infrastructure to be financed is generally of&#13;
a small scale. Installations for a public source of drinking water, a tap or a pump, do not need much&#13;
space; small pipes-maybe no more than a hose-if needed to bring water from a natural source, cause&#13;
little disruption on land use. All weather access roads would normally be built on existing access paths,&#13;
and would be no more than 4 meters wide. This width may exceed the existing one. but generally by no&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project         - 20 -                       September 13. 1996&#13;
more than 3 meters. Since houses are normally set back from walk paths and roads, impacts on them&#13;
would therefore be minimal. In those cases where houses are partially located within the widening area.&#13;
house owners normally agree to move them back because houses are normally temporary (bamboo or&#13;
timber) structures that can be moved relatively easily. and property values increase significantly once&#13;
roads are built-owners could sell the property later at a profit, as there are active land markets. Village&#13;
groups agree to assist the owner in moving his house. However, footpath accesses to the more isolated&#13;
villages but still eligible for the project, normally in mountainous areas. may not have alignmenits&#13;
appropriate for upgrading to road standards. In these cases, the field engineer will help determine&#13;
appropriate alignments and the village would make the land available (if it was too large a project. then&#13;
the village wouLld have been excluded from the program since the grant would not make a significant&#13;
"access7 difference).&#13;
4.25   Compensation per Bank criteria. Negative economic impacts caused by land acquisition are&#13;
also expected to be slight for the reasons stated above. The Project Manual states the need to keep land&#13;
acquisition to a minimum. Traditional processes of voluntary contributions are followed in villages&#13;
wvhere some land is unavoidably needed. To minimize peer pressure risk, however, where land needed&#13;
exceeds for example 20% of a villager's plot, the affected villagers will be given replacement land, other&#13;
equivalent productive assets or other in-kind compensation as negotiated during the village consultation&#13;
meetings (normally common-tenure lanid is used for compensation).  If a solid structure has to be&#13;
demolished, the village would provide materials and help build an equivalent structure. Subprojects that&#13;
involve compensation of this nature for land or other assets will not be approved by field engineers&#13;
unless adequate compensation arrangements have been agreed by the villager affected and the LKMD.&#13;
and compensation should have been made prior to the start of work (para. 3.12). In the unlikely event&#13;
that a larger number of persons were negativelv affected due to a subproject (e.g. more than 200 persons&#13;
each lost nmorc than 20% of their land or assets) and the field engineer found nio alternative that would&#13;
reduce the number of affected persons. then Bank approval of a related compensationi/resettlemiient plan&#13;
would be sought prior to proceeding with the subproject. In case of disagreement, affected villagers can&#13;
complaini to their field engineer and camat. Thev can also complain in writing to the P.O. Complaints&#13;
Box 5000 instituted successfully for the IDT program (para. 1.7). The criteria have been agreed with the&#13;
Goveniment for the VIP. as sumtimarized in Annex 5: thev are included in the Project Manual. The above&#13;
criteria are consistent with the Bank Guidelines for Involuntarv Resettlement (that include both&#13;
physically relocated as well as only economically affected persons: the proposed project foresees only&#13;
the latter) that require that negativelv affected families have their standard of living improved or at least&#13;
restored to pre-project levels.&#13;
H. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS&#13;
4.26   Low environmental impact. The project has been classified in environmlental category B. The&#13;
scope of village subprojects will be relatively minor. Access roads would be built with appropriate&#13;
aligiinlenits, cross and longitudinal drainage and gradients to lengthen the road life and minimize erosion&#13;
that higlher standard roads may create. Better provision of water in the project areas which are normallv&#13;
short of water in drv seasons should have a beneficial environmental impact and mav even help grow&#13;
vegetative contours. Overall the environmental impact is expected to be small, and positive. Given the&#13;
programzmatic nature of the project and the small environmental impact expected, no environmental&#13;
impact assessment will be prepared up front. Progress reports and supervisions would indicate ani&#13;
problems encountered and solutions adopted during implementation.&#13;
4. 7   Environmental guidelines. The VIP Project Manual includes standard designs and criteria&#13;
prepared in the past by DG Bina Marga and DG Cipta Karxa for small works; these designs incorporate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project         - 21 -                        September 13. 1996&#13;
environmental guidelines that are in accordance with Bank requirements. The VIP 11 Manual includes&#13;
presentation improvements suggested during 1995, the first year of use. The Manual is made widely&#13;
available to DPUKs, LKMDs and field engineers under the project (and the Manual is also being used for&#13;
other projects). The field engineers are required to incorporate sound environmental criteria in designs&#13;
of subprojects and verify their compliance during construction supervision.&#13;
4.28   Maintenance. Field engineers are also to explain to villagers the importance of maintenance&#13;
and how to maintain the infrastructures built under the project. for the works to last and enlvironmental&#13;
sustainability.  A maintenance plan is to be prepared in each village as part of the granit village&#13;
implemiientation agreement. Under the first year VIP, villagers agreed to maintain the works with their&#13;
gotong-royong' or voluntary labor system; however, some additional discussion1s will be needed if&#13;
additional, non-project cash outlays were to be required to buy materials or spare parts. The maintenanice&#13;
pledges are vet to be tested: the first year works under VIP were completed early 1996. Each field&#13;
engineer would return to the villages he assisted in 1995 to learn from his review, how the infrastructure&#13;
is holding up, and to help villagers with maintenance, in practice. Samiple villages shall be rcvisited to&#13;
review maintenance practices a vear or two after work completion.&#13;
1. PROJECT INDICATORS, MONITORING AND BANK SUPERVISION&#13;
4.29   Performance indicators. Physical progress as well as other aspects of the project will be&#13;
monitored following forms and indicators included in the Project Manual. The indicators are used for&#13;
VIP as part of the reporting/monitoring system. For monthly monitoring. the indicators focus on inputs&#13;
and outputs during implementation: participation of the poor (workdays of employmilenit). average and&#13;
total pay to labor; purchases of materials; physical works-such as kilometers of access roads built.&#13;
percent of plans, etc. These indicators are compiled by village and aggregated by kabupaten. province&#13;
and total. An indicator report sample from VIP is in Annex 7. Any land and compensation matters.&#13;
environmental effects, qualitv of selection and implementation of works, are to be reviewed and reported&#13;
on a sampling basis and will not have standard -"performance indicators". The P3DT Secretariat would&#13;
make available to the Bank all the progress reports mentioned.&#13;
4.30   Impact monitoring. Longer term impacts, such as the effect of a road construction on farmgate&#13;
price levels. on transportation costs. or of improved water provision, on its costs and quantitv and health&#13;
impact, can be evaluated once the village subproject is completed. Thuts various monitoring exercises&#13;
cover these aspects,&#13;
a)  upon completion of works in the village,&#13;
i) the field engineers complete a -'benefit evaluation" report;&#13;
ii) NGO/universities or other consultants undertake. in a sample of villages. a rapid rural&#13;
appraisal (RRA) of the project impact on various segments of the village population;&#13;
iii) BPS undertakes its socioeconomic household (SUSENAS) surveys in the same&#13;
villages surveyed for the RRAs. and the results are compared with simultaneous data&#13;
from non project villages- and&#13;
iv) all the monitoring sources are analyzed jointly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project        - 22 -                       September 13, 1996&#13;
b)  one or 2 years after completion, BPS SUSENAS surveys would be undertaken again in the&#13;
original project village sample to compare the evolution of their household data over time,&#13;
and with non-project villages. If warranted by "significant" results, tracing surveys would&#13;
be done 3 or 4 years after completion of the village project-probably in the first VIP&#13;
villages, for time constraints, and an analysis would be made with the data.&#13;
4.31   Supervision. The Bank would supervise the project via about 3 visits per year to randomly&#13;
selected villages, BRI units and other relevant agencies to review all aspects of progress, such as local&#13;
employment, costs and progress of work and impact on beneficiaries/the village. The Bank and GOI&#13;
would undertake an in-depth mid-term review after the first year implementation by February 28, 1998;&#13;
for which a report integrating the results of monitoring and evaluation activities, should be available on&#13;
or about January 31, 1998. Any adjustment deemed necessary will be made following the review, or&#13;
earlier if warranted. A Supervision Plan is included in Annex 8.&#13;
5. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. JUSTIFICATION&#13;
5.1    Analysis of alternatives. The Govemment wants to accelerate poverty reduction in Indonesia&#13;
and has assigned a high priority in the Bank's lending program to assisting its poverty program. Given&#13;
the good experience under VIP. it was estimated that the best way to reach many more poor villages&#13;
quickly was a follow on project based on the same VIP criteria. The project design has been embraced&#13;
by local and central agencies, as the more efficient one. and indeed, other projects are replicating the&#13;
features to some extent or fully.&#13;
5.2    Decentralization/stakeholder involvement.  The project provides a means to reach poor&#13;
villages directly, enabling a higher share of the funds to reach the poor faster, as layers of agency&#13;
involvement and supply delivery costs are reduced. By directing the funds to community selected&#13;
infrastructure projects likely to also be implemented and maintained with self-help, the community sense&#13;
and productivity of the poor are expected to increase and allow the poor to participate in economic&#13;
growth while contributing to it.&#13;
5.3   Institutional capacity analysis. Under VIP, the village groups and their institution, the LKMD,&#13;
headed by the village chief, have proven able to plan and, with the help of the field engineer, to&#13;
implement, small infrastructures.  The branches of the Public Works Ministry have successfully&#13;
supported the project with their mainly administrative role, and the BRI units have proven able to deal&#13;
with the advances for and disbursements to the villages within their existing capacity. The proposed&#13;
project extends the approach (described in Chapter 3) to more villages on Java and to Sumatra.&#13;
5.4   Java. Many ongoing programs already focus on the outer islands. Assisting poor villages on&#13;
Java and Sumatra to improve their infrastructure is justified. Villages on Java are larger so that more&#13;
people will use and benefit from infrastructure there, and construction costs are generally lower on Java&#13;
than elsewhere-meaning that more can be achieved with a fiscal dollar targeted on Java. Furthermore,&#13;
while the overall poverty incidence may be lower on Java than elsewhere, on Java the poor are more&#13;
numerous and may be relatively concentrated in smaller areas that can be better targeted and where the&#13;
earned cash may be more easily used in a productive way than in remote, outer island villages.&#13;
According to various sources, Java has higher than average infant mortality and high malnutrition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project         - 23 -                        September 13. 1996&#13;
5.5    Sumatra. Assisting poor villages on Sumatra is also justified. Sumatra has the second largest&#13;
number of poor, mostly in villages with difficult access and limited year round potable water. While&#13;
villages are normally smaller than on Java, so that the project grant is larger on a per capita basis, the&#13;
needs may be larger because of more village isolation and more difficult terrain that may need more&#13;
equipment based works or materials. The project would not assist the more remote villages, because the&#13;
grant could not make a significant difference there-other types of projects are needed; and in very poor&#13;
areas, over time new generations may prefer to seek better livelihoods elsewhere. It is common for a&#13;
family member to be a migrant worker providing remittances, and this would continuc after the project.&#13;
In such villages, better education is a priority-they know its value for jobs and pay levels in towns. The&#13;
govemment envisages expanded programs to improve primary education in parallel to the proposed&#13;
project; better teachers in villages is a priority for rural development.&#13;
5.6    Targeting. While not all the absolute poor live in the poor villages, addressing the needs of the&#13;
poor villages facilitates targeting. More of the funds would reach poor villagers compared to other&#13;
targeted public programs with higher delivery costs and less self-targeting. Employment and cash&#13;
compensation to village laborers is an important feature of the project. The cash to be eamed under the&#13;
project could provide an addition to the poorer household budgets; works can be scheduled so as to not&#13;
interfere with other income-eaming activities. Indeed, under VIP work demand nonnallv exceeded the&#13;
employment possibilities of the village grant, despite the relatively low incentive payment. In some&#13;
cases, however, there was work substitution: villagers considered the infrastructure to be top priority and&#13;
could finally devote their effort to building it because with the project pay they could buy food-without&#13;
the pay they lacked "credit" or capital. and had to get jobs elsewhere.&#13;
5.7    Beneficiaries.  Project beneficiaries are estimated at a maximum  5 million-the project&#13;
villagers. Poor laborers from outside the project villages may also benefit: materials such as stone,&#13;
gravel and sand for road works and surfacing normally have to be procured from outside the project&#13;
villages, and it is normally poor landless laborers who work in quarries. Many villagers in the selected&#13;
poor villages have subsistence livelihoods. Many are living with no more than $100 equivalent per year,&#13;
and a minimum cash income that however is necessary to buv clothing, basic medicine. primary school&#13;
materials, transport serices and other necessities. All weather access could make possible/affordable&#13;
commuting from the village to nearby urban type jobs and slow down outright emigration from rural&#13;
areas. With the project cash earned, village workers can also improve current or/and future consumption.&#13;
5.8    Training. Villagers may gain some technical and administrative knowledge with the program.&#13;
LKMDs greatly appreciated the VIP experience of managing and administering what for them was a&#13;
large project, and expressed interest in undertaking more works, even with bidding provided the&#13;
competition was "reasonable". Furthermore, villagers would be given some training to undertake&#13;
maintenance works, during the one year that the engineers assist each village.&#13;
5.9    Fiscal impact and cost recovery. The project design achieves the objectives at the lowest fiscal&#13;
cost: small infrastructures built with villager participation have proven under VIP to have lower unit&#13;
costs than equivalent works built under standard Ministry of Work contracts, even when thc cost of the&#13;
field engineers is included. The average project cost per villager is about $30 equivalent, somewhat&#13;
more on Sumatra, less on Java. That is, the benefits per fiscal dollar are larger with the VIP concept for&#13;
village works, and the benefits compare favorably with other types of public projects. To the extent that&#13;
the assistance is in the form of grants to villages, the Govemment does not have fiscal cost recovery per&#13;
se--but the benefits accruing to villagers provide economic cost recovery over at most 3 years, based on&#13;
the experience of the VIP (see Annex 9).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project           - 24 -                        September 13, 1996&#13;
5.10   Cost-effectiveness. The project focuses on infrastructure where implementation effectiveness is&#13;
generally higher. Labor-intensive methods are also efficient for the public budget. Villagers are willing&#13;
to work for the equivalent of about $1 per day. and at that cost labor intensive metlhods arc competitive&#13;
with capital intensive methods for the simple types of works envisaged. The villagers have to undertake&#13;
to maintain the facilities to be built under the project: but having participated in the construction and&#13;
aware of the infrastructure benefits, in sunveys villagers have indicated that they would maintain the&#13;
assets at no charge. provided they are taught how to.&#13;
5.11   Infrastructure ERRs. Without COunitillg the benefits from employment and lower unit costs of&#13;
works, the assets to be built under the project have high rates of retum, exceeding 20%. A majoritv of&#13;
the fhinds is likely to be used for building all weather access roads and bridges-nany of the poor&#13;
villages lack an all weather connection to their kecamatan center" with a minimum of 700 persons per&#13;
village-and several villages possibly usinig a common access-paths have considerable traffic and their&#13;
upgrading to all weather passabilitv has good economic retums. Thc provision of drinking water, as&#13;
denionstrated alreadv in other projects, also has high retumrs. Water by vendors or fetched at a distance&#13;
has highl cost and is rationed to occasionally unhealthy levels. Cost and scarcity of clean water can be&#13;
cased, even when the bulk water supply may be bought from a water utility. Women in villages report a&#13;
decrease in diarrhea and gastroenteritis following improved water supply. Examples of the high retums&#13;
to provision of all weather access roads and bridges are illustrated in Annex 9, based on the VIP&#13;
experience.&#13;
5.12   Sustainability. The infrastructure the villagers will build can last many years with maintenance,&#13;
and the villages commit themselves to unldertake the mainiteniance, given that they value the&#13;
infrastnictures. An effort will be made to reach good quality construction standards: with high standards,&#13;
benefits over the infrastructure life should be substantial. During supervision visits, it seems that the&#13;
delegation process changes villagers' attitudes and outtlook, but it is too early to gauge the durability of&#13;
this. The employment generated under the proposed project is of a temporary nature. For longer term&#13;
emllployment, it may be possible to establish systems to contract villagers for labor-intensive road&#13;
mainitenlance. The project type itself is not meant to be replicated on a standard basis: following this&#13;
assistance, it is the govemrment's objective to proceed with different projects to promote income&#13;
generation through rural-urban linkages and integration, and the government has started changing the&#13;
INPRES svstem towards continuing greater decentralization. Some funding under current top-down&#13;
programs could be reassigned in the future to similar local decision-making and labor-intensive projects.&#13;
Provision of technlical assistance to the implementation level will be required for effectiveness.&#13;
5.13   Poverty analysis. The ultimate impact on poverty can probably not be measured during project&#13;
implementation. as it will show later. However, the monitoring efforts under the project will ascertain&#13;
changes in houiselhold incomes and other variables over time, both in project villages and in&#13;
counterfactuals, who benefited, wlhat other impacts the project had, etc., and because each village is&#13;
clearly identified, it will be possible to undertake follow up surveys later on.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
5. 14   Risks. The risks associated with the project are relatively few:&#13;
a)  the risk of imnproper targeting seems small: a "long list" of villages will be proposed by&#13;
Bappenas based on the national BPS survey and clusters of villages selected by district level&#13;
planning agencies. so that the village "targeting" cannot be too wrong. Even non-IDT&#13;
villages are often poor. though not classified as such due to the parameters used to define&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second Village Infrastructure Project         - 25 -                        September 13. 1996&#13;
IDT villages. Only the poorer villagers tend to want to work for low pay (average of $1 per&#13;
day). The works have to have high priority since the villagers choose what to do with the&#13;
one-time grant. There is a risk that if a village is too remote, it mavi not reach significant&#13;
benefits from the grant, this being too small to make a difference in accessibility or&#13;
economic growth, though localized improvements should materialize. Very remilote villages&#13;
would not be included in the program:&#13;
b)  the risk of find diversion seems to be small: full avoidance of diversion is not expected, but&#13;
given that funds go directly to the beneficiary village. the program is transparent and&#13;
controls are in place for uses within the village, the level of diversion should be small. Anv&#13;
further controls would most likely cost more than the diversion avoided,&#13;
c)  the risk of using labor-intensive methods, generally more difficult than capital-intensive&#13;
methods due to logistics involved, is worthwhile confronting in order to promote greater&#13;
self-reliance and cash employment in poor rural villages deficient in small infrastructures.&#13;
Self-help projects and small local contractors often employ labor-intensive methods, and the&#13;
engineering inputs foreseen under the project should help enhance productivitv levels and&#13;
improve quality of designs and works. There is a risk of low quality of works: increased&#13;
focus on qualityv output will be emphasized and should give an example to follow&#13;
subsequently in other works. Cost savings would compensate risks of labor intensive&#13;
works;&#13;
d)  the risk of slower project implementation is low: the schedule would not be slown down due&#13;
to absorptive capacitv constraints, given the VIP experience. but if necessary the project&#13;
allows extending the program implementation and the technical assistance;&#13;
e)  there is a risk of subsequent maintenance of the infrastructures being faulty; however. the&#13;
villagers are the users and the infrastructure sustainability will be of prime concemn to them.&#13;
The field engineers., further, are to impress on villagers the low costs and high benefits of&#13;
maintenance, maintenance practices, and as necessary. will identifv sources for financing&#13;
future maintenance: and&#13;
f)  there is a risk of field engineers not being up to theJ oh; this is minimized by early scrutiny.&#13;
workshops, supervision by senior engineers and Bank/PMU missions: the systemn works&#13;
well under the VIP.&#13;
5.15   During project implementationi. supervisioin, independenit monitoring and audits should all help&#13;
identify problems and take early corrective action.&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;

SECOND VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
GUIDELINES FOR COMPENSATION FOR LAND OR ASSET AcQuiSMTION&#13;
Objectives&#13;
1.    Land acquisition will be kept to a minimum and no person will be physically displaced under&#13;
subprojects financed under the Project. Subproject proposals that would require demolishing houses or&#13;
acquiring productive land should be carefully reviewed to their  impacts  through   altemative&#13;
alignments. Proposals that require more than minor expansion along rights of way should be reviewed&#13;
carefully. Land or other assets may be acquired through:&#13;
a)  Voluntary contributions. In accordance with traditional practices, villagers may elect to&#13;
voluntarily contribute land or assets and/or relocate temporarily or permanently from their&#13;
land without a compensation;&#13;
b)  Contributions against compensation. A contributor considered "affected" will be eLigible&#13;
for compensation from the village.&#13;
2.    These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate affected persons under l.(b)&#13;
above, to ensure that all such persons negatively affected, regardless of their land tenure status, will be&#13;
assisted to improve, or at least restore, their living standards, income earning or production capacity to&#13;
pre-project levels. However, if acquired assets are less dm 20%, the field engineer may dispense with&#13;
the procedural requirements delineated in para. 5 below.&#13;
Compensation Principles&#13;
3.    The LKMD shall ensure that any of the following means of compensation are timely provided to&#13;
affected persons (the village grant cannot be used to pay compensation):&#13;
a)  replacement land with an equally productive plot or other equivalent productive assets;&#13;
b)  materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures to be demolished;&#13;
c)  replacement of damaged or lost crops at market value;&#13;
d)  other acceptable in-kind compensation.&#13;
Consultation Process&#13;
4.    The LKMD will ensure that all occupants of land and owners of assets located in a proposed&#13;
subproject area, are consulted. There will be a village meeting to inform villagers about their rights to&#13;
compensation and options available in accordance with these Guidelines, The Minutes of the village&#13;
meeting shall reflect the discussions held, agreements reached, and include the following:&#13;
a)  for any voluntary contributions, name of contributor and details about the contribution;&#13;
b)  for land/asset acquisition against compensation, names of affected persons and details about&#13;
the nature and level of compensation.&#13;

Summary                     Amount Compensation                    Agreement reached&#13;
(1) agric. land (m2)&#13;
(2) plots:&#13;
area affected (m2)&#13;
houses/structures&#13;
to be demolished (units/Mr)&#13;
(3) trees or crops affected&#13;
(4) signatures of villagers, kepala desa&#13;
(5) record of any complaints raised by affected persons&#13;
(6) map attached (showing affected areas and replacement areas)&#13;
5.     The field engineer shall provide a copy of the Minutes to affected persons and confirm in&#13;
discussions with each of them their requests and preferences for compensation, agreements reached, and&#13;
any eventual complaint.&#13;
Subproject Approval&#13;
6.    In the event that a subproject involves acquisition against compensation, the field engineer shall:&#13;
(a) not approve the subproject unless a satisfactory compensation has been agreed between the&#13;
affected person and the LKMD, as mentioned above;&#13;
(b) not allow works to start until the compensation has been completed satisfactorily to the&#13;
affected persons;&#13;
(c) in the unlikely event that more than 200 persons were affected and required compensation&#13;
in a village, a compensation plan has to be prepared, and approved by the IDT Secretariat,&#13;
before the subproject can be approved.&#13;
Complaints and Grievances&#13;
7.     All complaints should first be negotiated to reach an agreement at the village level. If this falls,&#13;
complaints and grievances about these Guidelines, implementation of the agreements recorded in the&#13;
Village Minutes or any alleged irregularity in carrying out the project can also be addressed by the&#13;
affected persons or their representative at the kecamatan level. If this also fails, the complaint may be&#13;
submitted to the Bupati for a decision.&#13;
Verification&#13;
8.     The village Minutes and evidence of compensation having been made shall be provided to the&#13;
field engineer assisting the village, to supervising engineers, auditors and socio-economic monitorers&#13;
when undertaking reviews under the Project.&#13;

SECOND VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT&#13;
1. Bank Supervision Input&#13;
a)  Regular supervision needs for the review  of progress reports, procurement actions,&#13;
correspondence, etc. are estimated to require four staff weeks per year. The staff input&#13;
indicated in the table overleaf is additional based on (i) the key activities mentioned in Annex 3&#13;
(Project Implementation Plan), and (ii) the assumption that a third year (1999) will be needed to&#13;
complete the monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
b)  Each of the project provinces should be visited at least once per year during project&#13;
implementation. Given the geographic dispersion of the villages, each supervision mission&#13;
would focus on a few clusters selected at random, or which would be deemed typical because of&#13;
their characteristics and their performance, as shown by the progress reports.&#13;
c)  Staff from the Resident Mission would assist in the supervision of this project, in particular&#13;
(i) in the environmental/social impact reviews and (ii) in the random ex-post review of the SOE&#13;
documentation.&#13;
2. Borrower's Contribution to Supervision&#13;
a)  A Project Launch Workshop per group of provinces is to be organized by GOI, after fill&#13;
mobilization of the EMC and the Field Engineers, and before the start of the civil works period&#13;
(May to October).&#13;
b)  The IDT Project Secretariat is responsible for project coordination, arrangements for Bank&#13;
supervision missions, and for providing requested information.&#13;
c)  Review meetings with the participation of the various project agencies will be held normally in&#13;
February of each year, to discuss the previous year's performance and the current year program.&#13;
The February 1998 will be a mid-term project implementation review.&#13;
d)  Quarterly Progress reports will report on the main inputs and outputs of the project. A sample&#13;
of the indicators to be used as part of the reporting/monitoring system are described in Annex 7.&#13;
e)  The Impact Monitoring System will report on the project's impact and development objectives.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This Second Village Infrastructure
            Project is classified as a targeted poverty reduction
            intervention. The main objective is to build small
            infrastructures in poor rural villages on Java and Sumatra.
            This also creates cash employment for villagers. Secondary
            objectives are to increase decentralization and community
            participation. The project will provide a grant to each of
            2,600 of the poorest villagers on Java and Sumatra for
            building local infrastructures. The villagers will decide
            what to build, from a menu of choices, and will build it by
            themselves, the workers being paid by output. Much of the
            grant may be used to purchase materials. Some equipment will
            be leased. Field engineers will assist the villagers to plan
            and implement the works, while also handling financial
            aspects. Senior engineers and a project management unit will
            be in charge of the overall planning, coordination and
            implementation management.
