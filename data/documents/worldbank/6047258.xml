                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
    The primary goal of the World Bank Institute (WBI) is to provide knowledge services&#13;
to build institutional capacity in client countries.      In FY03, WBI launched a new&#13;
approach to providing services that are country-focused, multi-year programs linked to&#13;
Bank country assistance strategies and the client's own poverty reduction goals. WBI in&#13;
coordination with Regional Vice Presidencies identified a group of 30 countries in which&#13;
to concentrate this new approach initially, starting in FY04.&#13;
&#13;
    In support of the country-focused approach, WBI's Evaluation Group (IEG)&#13;
concurrently initiated a series of evaluations to establish country-specific results to serve&#13;
as baselines in the priority countries. This report focuses on WBI activities implemented&#13;
in Kenya in FY02 and FY03.&#13;
&#13;
    The evaluation addresses the following three main questions.&#13;
&#13;
      ·     What is the relevance of WBI learning activities to Kenya and Kenyan&#13;
            participants?&#13;
&#13;
      ·     What are the effectiveness and impact of WBI learning activities?&#13;
&#13;
      ·     Do WBI activities have a sustained presence and comparative advantage in&#13;
            Kenya?&#13;
&#13;
    The sections below provide a summary of the methodology, main findings, and key&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
                                      METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
    The evaluation is based on multiple sources of data, including participant&#13;
questionnaires, participant focus group discussions, interviews with Bank staff working&#13;
on Kenya, and a review of the 1998 Kenya CAS and WBI FY02-04 CRS data. A Kenya-&#13;
based consulting firm collected the participant data in early 2004 from a 20 percent&#13;
random sample of Kenyan participants. The participant response rate was 92 percent.&#13;
&#13;
                                      MAINFINDINGS&#13;
&#13;
    The Client Recording System data is missing contact information on a substantial&#13;
proportion, 35 percent, of Kenyan participants, thereby excluding the possibility for&#13;
follow-up for further learning activities or for evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
    FY02 and FY03 WBI activities tended to be of short to medium duration and&#13;
involved small numbers of participants from Kenya: about a quarter of the learning&#13;
activities lasted for three or fewer days and 39 percent lasted for three and a half to five&#13;
days. More than 70 percent involved only one to five participants from Kenya.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          vii&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    A large majority, sixty nine percent of Kenyan participants' perceived the activity&#13;
they attended to be highly relevant to Kenya's specific needs, but only 44 percent&#13;
considered the activity to be highly relevant to their work.&#13;
&#13;
    The alignment of WBI's FY02 and FY03 activities to the 1998 CAS&#13;
recommendations was 56 percent, indicating that a substantial proportion of WBI&#13;
programs delivered were unrelated to the country strategy articulated in the CAS.           It&#13;
should be noted, however, that the Bank program changed substantially between 1998&#13;
and 2002, due to the changes in political circumstances, and therefore the activities may&#13;
have been more aligned with the Bank's approach. The WBI-CAS alignment index&#13;
should improve with the implementation of WBI's country-focused approach and the&#13;
development of the new 2004 CAS.&#13;
&#13;
    Participants' ratings reveal that WBI activities were moderately effective, but their&#13;
impact was less significant. Only 45 to 27 percent of the participants reported high use,&#13;
and 11 to 24 percent made little to no use, of knowledge and skills in specific domains&#13;
relevant to their work. Seventeen to 24 percent of the participants made little use of&#13;
knowledge and skills they gained for work practices, country development, and&#13;
influencing legislation, suggesting that the activity they attended did not lend itself to use&#13;
for direct institutional/country development purposes.&#13;
&#13;
    The development of action plans during activity implementation and participants'&#13;
perceived activity relevance to Kenya's needs and to their own work were significant&#13;
predictors of activity effectiveness. Effectiveness in turn was significantly related to the&#13;
participants' use of the knowledge and skills they gained in the learning activity.&#13;
However, only 45 percent of the activities appear to have included the development of&#13;
action plans as a pedagogical strategy for achieving outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
    Activity relevance to work, its effectiveness for addressing organizational needs, and&#13;
the participants' use of knowledge and skills for influencing legislation were on the lower&#13;
end of participant ratings, suggesting that the activities did not adequately target the&#13;
institutional dimensions of capacity building.&#13;
&#13;
    WBI's comparative advantage in Kenya is clear; fewer than 25 percent of the&#13;
participants were aware of similar activities being offered by other organizations. On&#13;
average, participants rated WBI activities to be more useful than those of other&#13;
organizations.&#13;
&#13;
    Despite this advantage, WBI activities did not have a sustained presence in Kenya.&#13;
On the positive side, 68 percent of the participants reported receiving contact information&#13;
for fellow participants. On the negative side, nearly 53 percent of the participants&#13;
reported that there was no follow-up contact by WBI.&#13;
&#13;
    Participant and Bank staff feedback suggests that lack of follow-up and non-strategic&#13;
targeting of Kenyan audiences was a significant barrier to institutionalizing capacity&#13;
building and realizing impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
viii&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                   RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
    WBI's demand-driven, country-focused direction in support of CAS should improve&#13;
the overall relevance of WBI activities FY04 and beyond. Nonetheless, key activity&#13;
design, implementation, and targeting will need attention, if sustained institutional impact&#13;
is the goal of WBI presence in Kenya. Some recommendations follow.&#13;
&#13;
      ·    Design activities that include follow-up and on-going contact with participants.&#13;
           Activities of this nature will require a careful targeting of participants, with&#13;
           help from the Kenya country team, for institutional impact.&#13;
&#13;
      ·    Include action plans as part of activity implementation to help participants&#13;
           apply what they learn to their jobs.&#13;
&#13;
      ·    Improve CRS participant information. Demand for activities with more WBI&#13;
           follow-up and on-going contact should create an incentive for WBI task&#13;
           managers to gather and report accurate participant contact information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         ix&#13;

                                 1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
1.1     The primary goal of the World Bank Institute (WBI) is to provide knowledge&#13;
services to build institutional capacity in client countries. In FY03, the Institute initiated&#13;
a new approach to providing services that are country-focused, multi-year programs&#13;
linked to the Bank's country assistance strategies and the client's own poverty reduction&#13;
goals.1&#13;
&#13;
1.2     To launch this customized approach, WBI in coordination with Regional Vice&#13;
Presidencies identified a group of 30 countries in which to concentrate its country-&#13;
focused capacity enhancement approach initially, starting in FY04.&#13;
&#13;
1.3     As part of its evaluation mandate, the Institute Evaluation Group (IEG) initiated a&#13;
series of evaluations to establish country-specific results to serve as baselines going&#13;
forward in the priority countries. In FY03, these countries were Brazil, Egypt, Russia,&#13;
Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and in FY04, the evaluations were extended to include Burkina&#13;
Faso, Guatemala, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Tajikistan, and Yemen (see Table 1). This&#13;
report takes as its focus the effectiveness and impact of WBI activities implemented in&#13;
Kenya in FY02 and FY03.&#13;

&#13;
1.4     The objectives of this evaluation are to:&#13;
&#13;
      ·     provide a descriptive summary of the WBI learning activities involving&#13;
            Kenyan nationals during FY02 and FY03, prior to the full start of the country-&#13;
            focused services;&#13;
&#13;
      ·     determine the effectiveness and impact of these activities; and&#13;
&#13;
      ·     examine aspects of the findings that may guide the development of further&#13;
            capacity enhancement services for Kenya.&#13;

1.5    The chapters hereafter specify the evaluation questions, provide an outline of the&#13;
evaluation methodology, and address each of the evaluation questions in turn. The final&#13;
chapter highlights the conclusions and provides recommendations for strengthening&#13;
country-focused work in Kenya.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                       2. EVALUATION METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
2.1      The evaluation addresses the following three main questions.&#13;
&#13;
       ·     What is the relevance of WBI learning activities to Kenya and Kenyan&#13;
             participants?&#13;
&#13;
       ·     What are the effectiveness and impact of WBI learning activities?&#13;
&#13;
       ·     Do WBI activities have a sustained presence and comparative advantage in&#13;
             Kenya?&#13;
&#13;
2.2      We used a combination of quantitative and qualitative data collection methods&#13;
and sources of information to answer these questions, including: (a) a quantitative survey&#13;
of a sample of Kenyan participants; (b) qualitative interviews with members of the&#13;
Bank's Kenya country team; (c) a focus group of participants of select WBI activities;&#13;
and (d) a review of the Kenya Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, 1998) and WBI's&#13;
Client Recording System (CRS) data. Annex 1 presents the data-collection instruments.&#13;
&#13;
                                 KENYAN PARTICIPANT SAMPLE&#13;
&#13;
2.3      The participant sampling procedure comprised identifying from WBI's Client&#13;
Recording System (CRS) all FY02 and FY03 learning activities that included participants&#13;
from Kenya. This procedure yielded a list of 93 activities with 727 Kenyan participants.2&#13;
After eliminating 35 percent of the participants for whom no contact information (i.e.,&#13;
work phone, fax, email address, or work address) was available, we obtained a sampling&#13;
frame of 433 participants who had attended 63 activities. We drew a 33 percent random&#13;
sample from this sampling frame for collecting survey and focus group data. Annex 2&#13;
presents the list of activities included in the sample.&#13;
&#13;
2.4      The sampling procedure highlighted the disturbing fact that contact information&#13;
was missing for a sizable portion of Kenyan participants, thereby excluding the&#13;
possibilities for follow-up for further WBI activities or for evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
Participant Sampling Results&#13;
&#13;
2.5      The final participant sample comprised 144 Kenyan nationals who had&#13;
participated in 47 WBI learning activities during FY02 and FY03.              The sample&#13;
represented 20 percent of the total Kenyan participant population and 50 percent of the&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2Excluding one-day activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.6       A local consulting firm3 collected the survey and focus group data from January&#13;
through March 2004. Time elapsed between activity implementation and data collection&#13;
ranged from 10 to 30 months. Contact information was incorrect or old for 39 (27&#13;
percent) of the original sample of 144 participants. We used a replacement sample list to&#13;
supplement the original sample, drawn from the same activities and programs, where&#13;
possible. A total of 133 completed participant questionnaires were received, for a&#13;
response rate of approximately 92 percent.&#13;
&#13;
2.7       Sixty-four percent of the survey respondents are male and 36 percent are female.&#13;
Approximately 32 percent worked in government at various levels (see Figure 1). The&#13;
participants were composed of nearly equal proportions of junior/entry-, mid-, and&#13;
senior/top-level staff (see Figure 2).&#13;

range of WBI programs.4 Table 2 below lists the total number of programs and activities&#13;
with participants from Kenya, and the programs and activities represented in the&#13;

&#13;
2.9       Good Governance, Health and Population, and Private Sector Development&#13;
offered the most number of activities to Kenyans.                   Three of these programs, Good&#13;
Governance, Governance and Public Sector Reform, and Private Sector Development, as&#13;
well as Environmental Management captured the largest number of Kenyan participants.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
2.11    The CRS data reveal that WBI activities tended to be of short to medium duration&#13;
and involved limited numbers of participants from Kenya.               About a quarter of the&#13;
learning activities lasted for three or fewer days and 39 percent lasted for three and a half&#13;
to five days. More than 70 percent involved five or fewer participants from Kenya (see&#13;
Figures 3 and 4).&#13;

&#13;
                                  ADDITIONAL DATA SOURCES&#13;
&#13;
2.12    Additional sources of data included a sample of Bank staff working on Kenya, a&#13;
sub-sample of the Kenyan participant sample for focus groups, and relevant documents,&#13;
as discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
Bank Staff Sample&#13;
&#13;
2.13    We identified a purposive sample of Bank staff for conducting qualitative&#13;
interviews regarding WBI's services to Kenya. We asked the Kenya country team for&#13;
recommendations for interviewing staff who were engaged in the sectors with the most&#13;
number of WBI activities and participants, including Private Sector Development,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Environment, and Health and Population. In addition, we drew on information collected&#13;
from the country team for a parallel evaluation of WBI's country-focused capacity&#13;
enhancement services in several countries, including Kenya.&#13;
&#13;
Focus Group Sample&#13;
&#13;
2.14    SBO Research, the local consulting firm, organized a focus group discussion with&#13;
specially selected Kenyan participants to obtain additional qualitative information&#13;
regarding the WBI activities they had attended.&#13;
&#13;
2.15    The focus group participant selection criteria included a random selection of&#13;
participants from the largest activities represented in the participant sample.    These&#13;
activities included: Introduction to Corporate Social Responsibility, Microfinance for&#13;
Non-specialists, and Capacity Development for Clean Development Mechanisms. Twelve&#13;
participants were invited, and seven attended the focus group discussion.&#13;
&#13;
Document Review&#13;
&#13;
2.16    Finally, a review of the 1998 CAS helped to contextualize the evaluation. We&#13;
assessed the alignment of WBI's FY02-04 activities to the 1998 CAS recommendations&#13;
and to active and pipeline lending projects in Kenya during those years.             The&#13;
methodology is discussed in the section presenting the results of this exercise. A review&#13;
of previous IEG evaluations helped to identify the factors that are associated with better&#13;
activity outcomes to guide the analyses in the present report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        3. RELEVANCE OF WBI LEARNING ACTIVITIES&#13;
&#13;
3.1       We assessed the relevance of WBI's FY02-03 activities to Kenya in two ways.&#13;
First, the analysis focused on the participants' assessments of activity relevance, and&#13;
second, we determined the alignment of the activities FY02-FY04 activities to the 1998&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). This exercise was conducted to obtain a baseline for&#13;
future reference, as WBI reorients its programs in the priority countries, including Kenya.&#13;
&#13;
                        PARTICIPANTS' ASSESSMENTSOF ACTIVITY RELEVANCE&#13;
&#13;
3.2       The participants provided their assessments of the learning activities' relevance to&#13;
Kenya's development needs, to their own work, and to the Millennium Development&#13;
Goals (MDGs) and the Bank's corporate priorities. These results are discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Relevance to Kenya's Needs and to Participants' Work&#13;
&#13;
3.3       Overall, twenty six percent of Kenyans indicated that the activity they attended&#13;
had been designed for participants from their country. If we consider activity-level data,&#13;
only 9 of the 38 activities with respondent data, or 24 percent, were considered to be&#13;
designed specifically for the participants from Kenya.5&#13;
&#13;
3.4       However, the participants provided moderately high ratings on activity relevance,&#13;
with mean ratings of 5.8 on relevance to Kenya's specific needs and 5.1 on relevance to&#13;
the participants' own work (on a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 denoting "not relevant at all" and&#13;
7 denoting "extremely relevant").&#13;
&#13;
3.5       Sixty nine percent of Kenyan participants' perceived the activity they attended to&#13;
be highly relevant to Kenya's specific needs. Only 1 percent perceived the topics covered&#13;
by WBI learning activities to be not relevant at all. In contrast, participants' assessments&#13;
of the relevance of the activity to their work was considerably lower; only 44 percent&#13;
considered the activity to be highly relevant, and 5 percent considered it to be not&#13;
relevant to the work they do.&#13;
&#13;
3.6       This feedback indicates that while the activities targeted the general issues of&#13;
concern to Kenya, a sizable proportion of the participants did not take away from them&#13;
specific knowledge or skills they could apply to their jobs (more on this issue in Chapter&#13;
4).&#13;
&#13;
Activity Relevance to MDGs&#13;
&#13;
3.7       A vast majority of the participants, 85 percent, reported that the activity they&#13;
attended was related to eradication of extreme poverty. A significant proportion of the&#13;
&#13;
5Activities rated as being designed for Kenyan participants by more than 50 percent of the participants. The activities need not be&#13;
"country-focused;" regional or global activities may also be viewed as being designed for participation by individuals from a specific&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
participants, 70 percent or more, were also involved in activities related to global&#13;
partnerships for development, environmental sustainability, investment climate and&#13;
finance, and trade (see Table 3). These responses highlight the cross-cutting nature of the&#13;
MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
3.8       Not surprisingly, a smaller proportion of the participants, less than 40 percent,&#13;
attended activities they rated as being relevant to maternal health and child mortality, as&#13;
none of the activities represented in the respondent data appears to be directly related to&#13;
these goals.&#13;
&#13;
3.9       The sampled WBI activities were directly related to eight of the 11 MDGs and&#13;
corporate priorities in FY02 and FY03. The largest number of activities were in the area&#13;
of investment climate and finance and none was directly related to child mortality and&#13;
water sanitation.6 The largest proportion of participants were from activities related to&#13;
improving investment climate and finance.&#13;

Participants' Qualitative Feedback&#13;
&#13;
3.10      Focus group conducted by SBO Research highlighted the fact that relevance to&#13;
work may be low due to incorrect targeting of participants. Several participants noted&#13;
that they did not work directly in the content area of the learning activity and were&#13;
therefore not in a position to utilize appropriately the knowledge and skills they gained.&#13;
&#13;
       ·     "They should contact the stakeholders who would know the benefits,"&#13;
             suggested one participant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6Gender may have been covered under a number of activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        ·       "I think that the World Bank should target the policy makers in institutions,"&#13;
                suggested another.&#13;
&#13;
SBO Research concluded that WBI should review its recruitment process to target more&#13;
relevant groups for its programs.&#13;
&#13;
                                       RELEVANCEOF ACTIVITIES TO CAS&#13;
&#13;
3.11        We assessed the alignment of WBI's in-country and out-of-country activities for&#13;
participants from Kenya with the 1998 CAS recommendations. The steps to deriving the&#13;
alignment index included: (1) reviewing and summarizing the CAS recommendations by&#13;
WBI thematic programs7; (2) listing all WBI activities (FY02-FY04) by thematic&#13;
programs; and (3) calculating percent alignment by dividing the total number of thematic&#13;
programs with both CAS recommendations and WBI activities by the total number of&#13;
programs with WBI activities (with or without CAS recommendations). The same set of&#13;
steps was followed for assessing alignment with lending operations.&#13;
&#13;
3.12       The alignment index for WBI activities with CAS recommendations is 56 percent,&#13;
and for lending projects it is 79 percent.                       There was clear non-alignment in seven&#13;
programs that were delivered without a specific CAS recommendation.                                        It should be&#13;
noted, however, that the Bank program changed substantially between 1998 and 2002,&#13;
due to the changes in political circumstances8, and therefore the activities in reality may&#13;
have been more aligned with the Bank's approach.&#13;
&#13;
3.13       Going forward, FY05 and beyond, the CAS-WBI alignment index should improve&#13;
with the new CAS (May 19, 2004) as the Kenya WBI program of activities is decided in&#13;
consultation with the country team on the basis of the new CAS. Annex 3 provides more&#13;
details on alignment.&#13;
&#13;
             BANKSTAFF ASSESSMENTOF ACTIVITY RELEVANCE AND USEFULNESS&#13;
&#13;
3.14       Kenya is host to two WBI Capacity Enhancement initiatives9, one on investment&#13;
climate and the other on implementing the Rapid Results approach to help the&#13;
Government of Kenya finalize and implement its economic recovery strategy.&#13;
&#13;
3.15       Interview data reveal that the two initiatives and the country-focused approach&#13;
have fostered productive relations between WBI and the Kenya country team. WBI is&#13;
represented on the CAS team, and WBI thematic program staff in Education and Public&#13;
Sector are working closely with the country sector staff. A key member of the country&#13;
team reported that WBI activities are better aligned with the country strategy and more&#13;
relevant to Kenya's needs than they were prior to FY04.&#13;
&#13;
3.16       Bank staff also reported that WBI still has "...a somewhat supply driven approach&#13;
and tends to come with its menu rather than developing its interventions based on the&#13;
&#13;
7As described in the World Bank Institute 2003 Annual Report. Recommendations encompassing multiple sectoral/thematic areas&#13;
were classified under each relevant program.&#13;
8A new government was elected in December 2002.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
situation." They suggest that WBI develop its strategy for capacity enhancement based on&#13;
sound country analysis to develop a more demand driven approach. This approach would&#13;
encompass closer coordination with the country team and other Bank units to avoid&#13;
duplication and provide high quality courses, identification of specific needs, and&#13;
identification of relevant target audience. Some examples of Bank staff feedback follow:&#13;
&#13;
· Closer coordination with other Bank units. A Bank staff member involved in a WBI&#13;
    activity noted that "...there are other organizations, such as [a unit within the Bank]&#13;
    that are specialized in this field ­ they have been researching and developing&#13;
    curriculum on this topic for years. ...WBI can coordinate with IFC. It need not even&#13;
    go outside the Bank, though there are other outside organizations too that WBI can&#13;
    coordinate with."&#13;
&#13;
· Identification of specific needs. There is a "...need to make courses more customized&#13;
    to a specific set of participants. In most cases participants just enjoy the experience&#13;
    of going for seminars but they actually don't use the information and therefore, in my&#13;
    opinion, 80 percent of the effort should go into designing the courses and getting help&#13;
    from the country team in identifying the specific issues and target audience."&#13;
&#13;
· Identification of the right target audience. "There are a lot of people who simply&#13;
    attend the training program, but there are very few people who are actually in a&#13;
    position to implement reforms." As an example, a number of activities focused on&#13;
    private sector development, with little investigation about who the champions of&#13;
    privatization and private sector reform are who could be included in the activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   4. EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPACT OF WBI LEARNING&#13;
                                                      ACTIVITIES&#13;
&#13;
4.1        We asked the participants to rate the effectiveness and impact of the learning&#13;
activities they attended through several questions. This chapter presents the participants'&#13;
responses as well as some multivariate analyses regarding the determinants of&#13;
effectiveness and impact.&#13;
&#13;
                           EFFECTIVENESSOF WBI LEARNING ACTIVITIES&#13;
&#13;
4.2        The evaluation measured six aspects of effectiveness anticipated for the WBI&#13;
learning activities:&#13;
&#13;
         ·     Raising       participants'         awareness/understanding                    of      development             issues&#13;
               important to their country,&#13;
&#13;
         ·     Providing participants with knowledge/skills,&#13;
&#13;
         ·     Helping participants understand their role in their country's development,&#13;
&#13;
         ·     Helping participants develop strategies/approaches to address the needs of their&#13;
               organization,&#13;
&#13;
         ·     Helping participants develop strategies/approaches to address the needs of their&#13;
               country, and&#13;
&#13;
         ·     Helping participants develop contacts and partnerships and build coalitions&#13;
               (Network).&#13;
&#13;
Participant Ratings of Activity Effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
4.3        Participants provided an overall average rating of 5.51, indicating that the&#13;
activities were considered to be slightly above moderately effective. The average was&#13;
computed over the six dimensions of effectiveness measured on a seven-point scale10,&#13;
from 1 denoting "not at all effective" to 7 indicating "extremely effective."&#13;
&#13;
4.4        Results disaggregated by the six dimensions of effectiveness reveal that a slim&#13;
majority considered the activity to be highly effective (see Figure 5). Activities were&#13;
most effective in helping participants understand their role in development but relatively&#13;
less effective in helping participants network. Activity effectiveness was also on the&#13;
lower end with respect to helping participants address the needs of their organization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10The responses were categorized into low effectiveness (ratings 1 and 2), moderate effectiveness (ratings 3-5), and high effectiveness&#13;
(ratings 6 and 7).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.5         The findings underscore the need for clearly articulating the goals of WBI&#13;
activities. If the primary goal is for advocacy and to raise participants' awareness, the&#13;
activities were largely successful. However, if the goals were to assist with networking&#13;
or implementing organizational change strategies, the activities cannot be considered to&#13;
be as successful.&#13;
&#13;
Determinants of Effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
4.6         On the basis of previous research11 and the assumptions underlying WBI's&#13;
country-focused direction, we hypothesized that a number of activity-related variables&#13;
would be positively related to participants' ratings of effectiveness12. We modeled an&#13;
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression as follows:&#13;
&#13;
                                     Effectiveness = 0 + 1 (Activity Features) + 2 (Participant Characteristics) + &#13;
&#13;
4.7         The activity features investigated include development of action-plans13 during&#13;
activity implementation, activity duration, and mode of instruction (including face-to-&#13;
face, distance learning, web-based learning, and other), and percent Kenyan participants&#13;
attending the activity.                                 The key participant characteristics included participants'&#13;
proficiency in the technical terminology of the learning activity, sex, and type of position&#13;
as controls (see Table 4).                                  Table 5 summarizes the regression results, and Annex 5&#13;
presents the means and standard deviations for all variables included in the regression.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11Khattri et al., (2002). Impact Evaluation of WBI Client Programs, FY00-01 (WBI Evaluation Studies No. EG03-63) identified a&#13;
number of participant- and activity -related variables that are related to participants' ratings of activity effectiveness. Subsequent IEG&#13;
country-focused evaluations conducted in FY03 confirmed the relationship between many of these variables and participants' ratings&#13;
of effectiveness.&#13;
12Based on the overall average of the six dimensions. Annex 4 presents the results of the factor analysis we conducted to ensure that&#13;
the six effectiveness dimensions tap into the same underlying factor of effectiveness.&#13;
13 "Action Plan" is a pedagogical method that focuses on helping participants develop a strategy to apply the knowledge and skills&#13;
acquired through the learning activity to their jobs. An IEG evaluation brief, "Pedagogy for Effectiveness and Impact: Evidence&#13;
Regarding Action Learning and Course Duration" (June 2003) discusses this pedagogy in greater detail.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                                                        13&#13;

4.8        As hypothesized, the development of action plans as part of the activity was&#13;
significantly related to higher ratings of effectiveness (ß=0.446, p&lt;.05). Similarly, high&#13;
perceived relevance of the course material to the participants' work yielded higher&#13;
effectiveness ratings (ß=0.279, p&lt;.01), as did perceived relevance of the activity to&#13;
Kenya's needs (ß = 0.204, p&lt;.05) (see Table 5). None of the other activity or participant&#13;
variables was significantly related to activity effectiveness.&#13;

4.9        The results highlight the importance of country-focus (i.e., providing activities&#13;
that are relevant from the point of view of the participants) and development of action&#13;
plans (i.e., plans to use the information and skills participants learn on the job) for&#13;
activity effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14We also modeled a regression with a variable indicating "in-country" and "out-of-country" activities, but the variable was not&#13;
significant.&#13;
15Compared to activities that used mixed-mode methods and study tours.&#13;
16Compared to participants in junior/entry-level positions.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
4.10                       Of note is the fact that only 45 percent of the activities included action plans17 as a&#13;
pedagogical strategy. With an enhanced focus on results, we should see more effective&#13;
pedagogies being incorporated into activity designs as well.&#13;
&#13;
                                                IMPACT OF WBI LEARNING ACTIVITIES&#13;
&#13;
4.11                       As a measure of impact of WBI activities, we asked participants to rate how often&#13;
they used the information and skills they gained in the following domains of use:&#13;
       ·                      Research,&#13;
&#13;
       ·                      Teaching,&#13;
       ·                      Raising public awareness in development issues,&#13;
&#13;
       ·                      Implementing new practices within their work organization,&#13;
&#13;
       ·                      Organizing collective initiatives,&#13;
       ·                      Influencing legislation and regulation, and&#13;
&#13;
       ·                      Implementing country development strategies.&#13;
&#13;
4.12                       In addition, the participants assessed the degree to which the activity influenced&#13;
or led to changes in the same domains of use as above and in the specific area addressed&#13;
by the activity.&#13;
&#13;
Ratings of Use and Activity Influence&#13;
&#13;
4.13                       Forty to 80 percent of Kenyan participants reported working in the domains noted&#13;
in Figure 6.                         A vast majority, 80 percent, considered raising public awareness in&#13;
development issues to be part of their work, but relatively few, 47 percent, were involved&#13;
in teaching. Overall 83 percent of the participants worked in at least one domain of use&#13;
noted in the figure, and on average participants worked in 4.3 areas noted.&#13;

4.14       Among those participants for whom the domains of use specified were relevant,&#13;
ratings of high use18 ranged from 45 percent for raising others' awareness about&#13;
development issues to only 27 percent for influencing legislation or regulations (see&#13;
Figure 7). More notably, 11 to 24 percent who worked in a specific area made little to&#13;
no use of the knowledge and skills in that specific area.&#13;

4.15       The fact that 17 to 24 percent of the participants did not use the knowledge and&#13;
skills they gained for country development, work practices, and influencing legislation&#13;
suggests that the activity did not lend itself to practical institutional/country development&#13;
purposes.&#13;
&#13;
Activity-Influenced Changes&#13;
&#13;
4.16       As a measure of institutional or sectoral impact, participants rated the degree to&#13;
which the activity influenced or led to changes in the specific area addressed by the&#13;
learning activity. Among the ninety one percent of the participants who reported that the&#13;
learning activity contributed to changes in the sector or area addressed by the activity, a&#13;
vast majority, 95 percent, rated the changes as being positive (ratings of 5 or above on a&#13;
scale of 1 to 7). The mean rating was 5.8, indicating that overall the change was viewed&#13;
as being positive.              However, because the survey question is open to interpretation,&#13;
participants' answers provide no information regarding the substance of the change.&#13;
&#13;
4.17       The survey also asked participants to rate the influence of the activity they&#13;
attended on a number of generic areas of impact noted in Figure 8. A majority of the&#13;
participants, more than 50 percent, considered the activities' influence to be positive in&#13;
all domains except "legislation and regulations" (see Figure 8). It is worth emphasizing&#13;
that large numbers of participants (33 to 56 percent) noted that the activity did not lead to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18Responses on a 7-point scale, with 1 denoting "no use" and 7 denoting "high use" were recategorized as follows: high use (ratings&#13;
of 6 and 7), moderate use (ratings of 3 to 5) and low use (ratings of 1 and 2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
any changes. From this perspective, the impact of WBI activities can be considered to be&#13;
only moderate. Of particular concern is the area of institutional change (i.e., changes to&#13;
work practices and legislation/regulation), where impact appears to be particularly weak.&#13;

4.18                       Using an average of participants' ratings across the seven domains of use19 as the&#13;
dependent variable, we estimated a parsimonious two-stage regression model to assess&#13;
the role activity effectiveness plays in participants' use of knowledge and skills20,&#13;
controlling for environmental factors and participant characteristics. The two-stage least&#13;
squares modelwas estimated as follows:&#13;
&#13;
   Effectiveness (stage one) = 0 + 1 (Activity Features) + 2 (Participant Characteristics) + &#13;
&#13;
   Impact (Participant Use) (stage two) = 0 + 1 (Effectiveness) + 2 (Environmental Variables) + 3 (Type&#13;
   of Work) + &#13;

 5. WBI'S SUSTAINED PRESENCE AND COMPARATIVE&#13;
                                            ADVANTAGE&#13;
&#13;
5.1      The evaluation assessed the degree to which WBI activities have a sustained&#13;
presence in Kenya, thereby facilitating the development of in-country capacity on an on-&#13;
going basis. We also addressed the issue of whether WBI has a comparative advantage in&#13;
Kenya to undertake this complex task.&#13;
&#13;
                                   WBI'S SUSTAINED PRESENCE&#13;
&#13;
5.2      We used two indicators of sustained presence: (a) whether or not contact&#13;
information or newsletters were provided to facilitate on-going networking and therefore&#13;
exchange of information and ideas among the participants; and (b) whether follow-up to&#13;
the learning activity was implemented.             The FY00-01 Impact Study identified these&#13;
measures of post-activity support to be key factors for use of knowledge and skills gained&#13;
in the learning activity and, ultimately, impact.&#13;
&#13;
5.3      On the positive side, 68 percent of the participants reported receiving contact&#13;
information for fellow participants.           Among these, a majority, 60 percent, used the&#13;
contact information to organize discussions and 14 percent used the information to&#13;
organize follow-up activities. However, almost a quarter of the participants, 26 percent,&#13;
never used the contact information&#13;
&#13;
5.4      On the negative side, nearly 53 percent of the participants reported that there was&#13;
no follow-up contact by WBI, and only 25 percent of the participants contacted WBI to&#13;
follow-up on issues regarding or questions about the content of the learning activity.&#13;
&#13;
5.5      Participants' focus group and interview feedback indicated that WBI activities did&#13;
not encourage ownership and institutionalization of the learning process in Kenya, even&#13;
through participants found the activities to be useful and informative.                Despite (or&#13;
perhaps because of) the wide variety of learning activities and various modes of delivery&#13;
offered by WBI, the consensus among participants (and many Bank staff) is that the&#13;
learning process is supply-driven, and, therefore did not encourage Kenya to either use&#13;
the learning for substantial sectoral/institutional change or to take the learning process&#13;
forward (see Box 1).&#13;
&#13;
                           Box 1. Focus Group Analysis by SBO-Research&#13;
&#13;
 Past learning activities experienced considerable shortcomings as a result of inadequate follow&#13;
 up. It is difficult to ascertain WBI's objectives and commitment if it simply pumps resources into&#13;
 training manpower and does not have follow up. Participants' observations were as follows:&#13;
     ·     "There should be a system for continuity, follow up, and feedback."&#13;
     ·     "That was the introduction course. When are we doing the real thing? The next stage&#13;
           should run to completion."&#13;
     ·     "The World Bank should franchise some institutions locally to conduct the learning&#13;
           activities on a continuous basis ­ have a resource person to be able to train others."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.6     Recommendations from both the participant focus group and Bank staff&#13;
interviews underscored two major points: (a) the need to base future WBI programs on&#13;
better needs assessment and (b) to make the program more demand driven.&#13;
&#13;
                                    WBI'S COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE&#13;
&#13;
5.7     We assessed WBI's comparative advantage in Kenya by asking participants to&#13;
compare the quality of the WBI activity they attended to that of the activities/services&#13;
provided by other institutions.&#13;
&#13;
5.8     WBI appears not to have much competition from other institutions in the&#13;
programmatic areas that were active in Kenya during FY02-03. Only 22 percent of the&#13;
respondents were aware of similar activities being provided by other organizations. Of&#13;
these 22 percent, 25 percent identified competition from non-WBI sources in&#13;
Environment, followed by Attacking Poverty (17 percent) and Private Sector&#13;
Development program (18 percent). Good Governance, a program that offered numerous&#13;
activities in Kenya faced negligible competition from non-WBI sources (only 3&#13;
participants were aware of non-WBI activities in this field).&#13;
&#13;
5.9     Participants noted that the activities provided by other institutions were on&#13;
average less effective than the WBI learning activity they attended. The average rating&#13;
comparing WBI activities to non-WBI activities was 5.3 on a scale of 1 to 7, with 1&#13;
indicating that the WBI activity was much less useful, 4 denoting that both were about&#13;
the same, and 7 denoting that the WBI activity was much more useful.&#13;
&#13;
5.10    Focus group participants' remarks highlight the value they ascribe to WBI&#13;
programs:&#13;
&#13;
· "The alternatives of such learning activities are less value for money compared to the&#13;
    WBI activities."&#13;
&#13;
· "The willingness to pay is there, but the ability to pay is lacking...I tried to get in&#13;
    touch with WBI to find out where I could get support to do the course, but I never&#13;
    heard from them again."&#13;
&#13;
5.11    Although WBI appears to have a comparative advantage in the programmatic&#13;
activities it offers to Kenyan participants, there has been much less effort in ensuring that&#13;
the initial investments made through the activities pay off on a longer term basis through&#13;
the provision of on-going support and follow up.&#13;
&#13;

        6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
6.1     This chapter summarizes the main findings and conclusions and offers three key&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
                               FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
&#13;
The Client Recording System needs substantial improvement.&#13;
&#13;
6.2     The Client Recording System data is missing contact information on a substantial&#13;
proportion, 35 percent, of Kenyan participants, thereby excluding the possibility for&#13;
follow-up for further learning activities or for evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
The pattern of participant ratings suggests that activities did not adequately target the&#13;
institutional dimensions of capacity building.&#13;
&#13;
6.3     A large majority, sixty nine percent of Kenyan participants' perceived the activity&#13;
they attended to be highly relevant to Kenya's specific needs, but only 44 percent&#13;
considered the activity to be highly relevant to their work. This finding underscores the&#13;
need to provide demand-driven activities to ensure that they are more pertinent and useful&#13;
for Kenyan participants' work.&#13;
&#13;
6.4     The alignment of WBI activities The alignment of WBI's FY02 and FY03&#13;
activities to the 1998 CAS recommendations was 56 percent, indicating, that a substantial&#13;
proportion of WBI programs delivered were unrelated to the country strategy articulated&#13;
in the CAS. It should be noted, however, that the Bank program changed substantially&#13;
between 1998 and 2002, due to the changes in political circumstances, and therefore the&#13;
activities may have been more aligned with the Bank's approach.             The WBI-CAS&#13;
alignment index should improve with the implementation of WBI's country-focused&#13;
approach and the development of the new 2004 CAS.&#13;
&#13;
6.5     The participants' ratings reveal that WBI activities were moderately effective, but&#13;
their impact was less significant. Only 45 to 27 percent of the participants reported high&#13;
use, and 11 to 24 percent made little to no use, of knowledge and skills in specific&#13;
domains relevant to their work. The fact that 17 to 24 percent of the participants did not&#13;
use the knowledge and skills they gained for work practices, country development, and&#13;
influencing legislation suggests that the activity they attended did not lend itself to use for&#13;
direct institutional/country development purposes.&#13;
&#13;
6.6     Interviews with Bank staff indicate that activity relevance and use may be&#13;
enhance through better needs assessment and targeting of participants.&#13;
&#13;
6.7     The use of action plans as a pedagogical tool and activity relevance to Kenya's&#13;
needs and to participants' work were significant predictors of activity effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Effectiveness in turn was significantly related to the participants' use of the knowledge&#13;
and skills they gained in the learning activity.&#13;
&#13;
6.8     Activity relevance to work, effectiveness for addressing organizational needs and&#13;
use for influencing legislation were on the lower end of participant ratings.&#13;
&#13;
      ·     Although WBI's comparative advantage is clear, WBI activities did not have a&#13;
            sustained presence in Kenya, also contributing to less than optimal impact.&#13;
&#13;
6.9     Fewer than 25 percent of the participants were aware of activities similar to&#13;
WBI's being offered by other organizations.         On average, participants rated WBI&#13;
activities to be more useful than those provided by other organizations.&#13;
&#13;
6.10    Sixty eight percent of the participants reported receiving contact information for&#13;
fellow participants, but nearly 53 percent of the participants reported that there was no&#13;
follow-up contact by WBI.         Focus group participants indicated that WBI activity&#13;
participants see follow up as key to activity success.&#13;
&#13;
                                   RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
6.11    WBI's demand-driven, country-focused direction in support of CAS should&#13;
improve the overall relevance, effectiveness, and impact of WBI activities FY04 and&#13;
beyond. Nonetheless, key activity design features, implementation, and targeting will&#13;
need attention, if sustained institutional impact is the goal of WBI presence in Kenya.&#13;
Some recommendations follow.&#13;
&#13;
    § Design activities that include follow-up and on-going contact with participants.&#13;
        Activities of this nature will require a careful targeting of participants for&#13;
        institutional impact.&#13;
&#13;
    § Include action plans as part of activity implementation to help participants apply&#13;
        what they learn to their jobs.&#13;
&#13;
    § Improve CRS participant information. Demand for activities with more WBI&#13;
        follow-up and on-going contact should create an incentive for WBI task managers&#13;
        to gather and report accurate participant contact information.&#13;

&#13;
Participants' ratings show that neither of the two environmental factors, participant's&#13;
work environment (work procedures, colleagues, etc.) nor country development&#13;
environment (such as country policies, social and political groups, etc), hinders&#13;
participants' use of knowledge and skills gained in the learning activity. Only 7 percent&#13;
or fewer participants rated these environmental factors as being unhelpful to their use of&#13;
knowledge and skills. In fact, close to 50 percent of the participants noted that these&#13;
factors were helpful in using the knowledge and skills they gained from the learning&#13;
activity (see Figure 1 below).&#13;

            The impact of WBI activities FY02-03 on
            participants from Kenya : A baseline assessment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The primary goal of the World Bank
            Institute (WBI) is to provide knowledge services to build
            institutional capacity in client countries. In FY03, WBI
            launched a new approach to providing services that are
            country-focused, multi-year programs linked to Bank country
            assistance strategies and the client's own poverty
            reduction goals. WBI in coordination with Regional Vice
            Presidencies identified a group of 30 countries in which to
            concentrate this new approach initially, starting in FY04.
            In support of the country-focused approach, WBI's
            Evaluation Group (IEG) concurrently initiated a series of
            evaluations to establish country-specific results to serve
            as baselines in the priority countries. This report focuses
            on WBI activities implemented in Kenya in FY02 and FY03. The
            evaluation addresses the following three main questions.
            What is the relevance of WBI learning activities to Kenya
            and Kenyan participants?  What are the effectiveness and
            impact of WBI learning activities?  Do WBI activities have a
            sustained presence and comparative advantage in Kenya?
