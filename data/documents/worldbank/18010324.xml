&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: Today is May 14, 1985. My name is Bogomir Choke!, Archivist of the World Bank, and I&#13;
have the privilege to have with me Mr. Albert Waterston, who has been with the Bank from its earliest&#13;
stages in 1947 until his retirement in 1972. Throughout his 25 years with the Bank he was deeply&#13;
involved in economic development and development planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Mr. Waterston, you have devoted practically all your life to development economics and planning.&#13;
What made you choose such a topic and what is its fascination for you?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Well, Mr. Choke!, let me say for the record that I really didn't get into planning until I&#13;
went to the EDI [Economic Development Institute] in 1958. Between 1947 and 19581 was an&#13;
economist, a loan officer, a jack-of-all-trades really, moving from one job to another. In 19581 was a&#13;
loan officer for Colombia. Today, when you have more Vice Presidents than there are Ethiopians&#13;
starving, that sounds like a very low job. But the truth is that in those days to be the loan officer of a&#13;
country like Colombia was to have a very high position, not only because Colombia was one of our best&#13;
clients, but also because the Vice President of the Bank, the only Vice President, Bob [Robert L.]&#13;
Garner, was very interested in Colombia. It meant that be and I dealt with each other directly over the&#13;
phone and we frequently took trips together. I was very, very conscious of the fact that he was&#13;
interested in this country, and I learned a lot from it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I say all of this because on a certain day Mike [Michael] Hoffman, who at that time headed the&#13;
Economic Development Institute, came to see me and asked me to join the ED I. For a moment I was&#13;
flattered, but then I said, "I cannot possibly leave Colombia. I love it. No thank you." And I forgot&#13;
about it. The next day I received a call from Gene [Eugene R.] Black [President of the World Bank],&#13;
and be said, "AI, come up to see me." Well, that is certainly different from the present time. And I&#13;
went up to see him. I was in his office for 45 minutes, and during that time be occasionally bad to deal&#13;
with other people. I remember one was Henry Riley, at that time in the Bank's Treasurer's&#13;
Department. They had a real argument. But Mr. Black didn't want me to leave.&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                          -2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WATERSTON]&#13;
     Mr. Black said to me, "AI, I want you to join the EDI, but for a personal reason. I want you to join&#13;
because I want you to write a book. You wrote a book called The Economic Development of Mexico,&#13;
and the Bank ought to write a book." And I said, "What about?" He said, "I don't know. But wait a&#13;
minute." He said, "Didn't you one time draft a development planning statute for Colombia?" I said,&#13;
"Yes, but it was a real disaster. I didn't know what I was doing." He replied, "You're an expert on&#13;
planning. Write a book on planning." And I said, "WeD, if I went to the EDI, I would be lost. Over&#13;
here I'm in action." And he said, "Oh, don't worry about it, and to prove it, I'm going to give you a $500&#13;
raise." Now, that doesn't sound like much of a raise, but when you remember that I entered the Bank&#13;
with the munificent salary of $6,000 net of taxes, taking a cut of 50 percent from my U.S. Government&#13;
earnings, $500 was nice to get. At that time I had been elevated to a salary of $9,500 net of taxes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So I joined the EDI and that's how I began to work on development planning, and that's how I met&#13;
you. But perhaps we ought to leave that for a later time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: You know, the next question is rather philosophical. Prior to World War II the Council&#13;
for Development Economics was sort of an embryo, and the term development economics was still&#13;
evolving. From what I have been reading on the subject we could mention quite a few economists, you&#13;
know, but three great names come to the mind: Eugene Staley, Kurt Mandelbaum and especially Paul&#13;
Rosenstein-Rodan. Did their work influence in any way your concepts of development planning?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: I think that's a very good question. As far as Gene Staley and Mandelbaum are&#13;
concerned, negligibly. But in the case of Rosenstein-Rodan, who became a very close friend, by the&#13;
way--in fact at one time I was thinking seriously of writing a book about him--he influenced nie greatly.&#13;
But you should realize that when I say he influenced me, I mean theoreticaUy, as an economist thinks.&#13;
This man was brilliant in the insights he had. As Burke Knapp said, he was so far ahead of his time&#13;
that he could see the importance of what was going on in a way that very few people could see. But&#13;
Paul was essentially an academic and a theorist. He did not make any real impact on the policy of the&#13;
Bank because someone like Bob Garner wouldn't even talk to him. He had a way of talking which was&#13;
foreign to a pragmatist like Bob Garner, who was after all a southerner who went to New York and&#13;
became an officer of the Guaranty Trust and then came to Washington. So Paul's impact on the Bank&#13;
was low. His impact on economists was much greater.&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                          -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(WATERSTON]&#13;
    But even on me he had much less influence than you would expect, for a very good reason. The&#13;
World Bank was essentially a pragmatic organization. We did not start with a theory, which is the way&#13;
Paul Rosenstein-Rodan's thinking started, and deduce actions as a result of that. That was a way which&#13;
did not sit well with bankers in the ftrst place, and secondly we were dealing day to day with countries,&#13;
which meant that we had to start with the facts as we found them. And if you start with the facts, you&#13;
really reason inductively. You build up from the facts to a conclusion. Ideally both ways should be&#13;
used, but in the early days of the Bank a great deal was happening. It was the inductive approach that&#13;
really had the power, and for that reason Rosenstein-Rodan was a fish out of water. Bear in mind, too,&#13;
that I was one of the few people who came to the Bank with development experience, because between&#13;
1946 and 1947, I was Vice President of the Virgin Islands Company, a U.S. development corporation in&#13;
the Virgin Islands, and I operated 5,000 acres of sugar cane land. I also operated a ship and two power&#13;
stations, so that I had learned and in fact depended on learning from the facts, moving from the bottom&#13;
up. Paul couldn't do that and, hence, he had to leave the Bank eventually, which is a great pity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: That's what I understood, because as you mentioned before, his ideas were way ahead of&#13;
his time, you know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: He was brilliant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: But I think he was sort of a voice crying in the desert. Later his ideas began picking up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Right. Well, as in Gray's "Elegy", "Many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste&#13;
its fragrance on the desert air." That, unhappily, was Paul Rodan in the World Bank of 1947 or 1948.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: You joined the Bank in 1947. First, you were a loan officer, as you mentioned before, and&#13;
then an economist in Area Division I dealing with Northwestern Europe. That I believe was the time&#13;
of the reconstruction period, as we call it now in the Bank, you know, ftrst the loans to Europe,&#13;
although loans number 5 and number 6, which went to Chile, were actually development loans, but now&#13;
we could call them even structural loans, you know.&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                           -4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Yes, balance of payments loans. I came to the Bank and began working immediately&#13;
with loans to the Netherlands and Belgium. In fact, my flrst foreign mission was to these countries.&#13;
But that didn't last long before they were out because of the Marshall Plan, which changed the whole&#13;
situation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: What do you think about the Marshall Plan's impact on Europe? Was it something that&#13;
really saved Europe?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Oh, there's no question about that. In the words of Winston Churchill, it was the&#13;
greatest piece of magnanimity of the United States to Europe, for its own self-preservation perhaps,&#13;
but it certainly made a great difference.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: I was in Europe at that time, and I know that I was a great beneficiary of the Marshall&#13;
Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Well, everybody was.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: But there were no ideas of planning at that time, the early period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Well, you must remember that planning was a dirty word. It had been used only by&#13;
two forces. One was the Communists in the U.S.S.R. They had begun planning in 1929. It was really a&#13;
very small kind of plan. It was sectoral plan on electricity and industry, and the other countries which&#13;
had used it were the fascist countries--the Italians and the Nazis. In fact, when Italy felt it had to plan&#13;
after the war, it remembered this terrible connotation which the word planning had, and they called&#13;
planning--and still do--programmazione. Not planiflcazione but programmazione.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: Well, I think there's a difference between programming and planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Oh, yes, but not in Italy. In those days, programmazione was a euphemism for&#13;
planning. You're quite right that they're not the same thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: No, I remember that at the University of Trieste, when I studied at the School of&#13;
Economics, we were taught that the corporative state, as they called it, is the best mix between&#13;
capitalist liberalism of the West and the Communist totalitarians of the East. So they always claimed&#13;
that they had something in between.&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                         -5-&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Oh, people were afraid of that word for a long time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: So in 1952 you began working with Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: And, of course, here we come to one of your major accomplishments--The Economic&#13;
Development of Mexico that you spoke of before. How do you compare the fmdings and&#13;
recommendations of the report with the present situation of the Mexican economy?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Well, of course, this is a big subject. When I ftrst went to Mexico in 1948, people&#13;
thought Mexico was the land of the siesta. I remember the Seven-Up people got into difficulties with&#13;
the Mexicans because they had an advertisement showing a Mexican sitting on the ground with his&#13;
knees drawn up and his very large sombrero over his face as he napped. This was the prevailing picture&#13;
of Mexico in the U.S., you see. But that changed, of course. Mexico, when we went there, and present&#13;
day Mexico, are two different countries. It also shows how little people understood what it takes to&#13;
develop a country. Our study, which I think I can say really made an impact on Mexico in many ways,&#13;
was a deviation from the usual report in that we made a study of their investment and the returns which&#13;
they got for each peso invested. That was a novel thing, and as a result of this, we came to the&#13;
conclusion that Mexico had really tapped all the major projects they had available in the country and&#13;
during that time they had done very well--much better than most people thought, much better than the&#13;
Mexicans thought. They had been very, very self-conscious of what they thought was a low return, and&#13;
we showed that the return was much higher. It gave them a great sense of confidence. We said,&#13;
however, that for the future "you will have to do more planning." And in our conclusion we said that&#13;
"you will have to plan if you want to grow." That was an error and I shall come back to it, but it was the&#13;
ftrst time really that I thought I saw the need for comprehensive planning, because they had exhausted&#13;
the piece by piece project approach and, therefore, I thought they had to plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now you can see how wrong I was because they didn't really follow the advice to plan. But Mexico&#13;
today is an industrialized country and the Mexicans have done wonders. People don't realize what an&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                            -6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WATERSTON]&#13;
enormous accomplishment Mexico has achieved without planning, so to speak. They might deny this&#13;
because there has been a bit planning here, a bit planning there; but the kind of planning which the&#13;
Bank advocated--which I advocated--they haven't followed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: That point was stressed in the report, if I recall correctly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: Instead of piece-by-piece projects, they should develop a comprehensive plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Yes, but they didn't. And what is more, if you judge the cake by its taste, they didn't&#13;
have to because they developed without the plan. Oh, sure, they had all sorts of problems. They still&#13;
have, but look at Mexico today. It is a very advanced country in Latin America. And they did it&#13;
without planning, a very important point in my education, as you will see.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: Does the concept of economic development apply universally to all less developed&#13;
countries, or is each country a patient by itself?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Well, the words "economic development planning" or "economic development' really&#13;
mean what you want them to mean. When Mr. [RobertS.] McNamara came to the Bank, he knew very&#13;
little about economic development, and he had come here because, quite by accident, Jack [John L.]&#13;
Maddux had written a speech for him a few years before in which he spoke of the need for economic&#13;
development of the Third World. Why he gave such a speech I don't think anybody knows, but the&#13;
speech was later used by Lyndon Johnson as an excuse to make McNamara President of the World&#13;
Bank, and it served him right. When he came here, he thought--as many did, as even I did at certain&#13;
points--that there was a key factor which determined how fast a country developed. If you could fmd&#13;
that key factor, you could obtain economic development. Not ouly in one country, but in any country&#13;
almost. He began where Gene Black's Bank and [George D.] Woods' Bank had left off. You&#13;
remember when Black was President it was thought the key factor was that the Bank could perform the&#13;
best role by fmancing infrastructure--roads, power plants and so on. And for a long time everybody&#13;
thought that was a good idea because they thought that the private sector would come in if we supplied&#13;
power and roads and would invest. By the way, that was one of Rosenstein-Rodan's ideas.&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                          -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[WATERSTON]&#13;
     For a long time that worked very well, but then the possibilities for these infrastructure projects&#13;
were nearing exhaustion. McNamara began to look for other key factors and he turned first to&#13;
industrialization, and for a while that was the big thing in the Bank. The idea then was to industrialize&#13;
the poor countries. But then that petered out because it didn't work well. Anyway, the private sector&#13;
was doing a great deal of industrialization. So he turned next to urban development. The idea then&#13;
was that what you had to do was to develop the cities because that's where the development really takes&#13;
place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: This is what we used to refer to as the new style projects, right?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Yes. Then that petered out, so he turned to agricultural development, which by the&#13;
way, as I shall try to tell you later, came closer to the truth. But that didn't work out. And so they&#13;
turned to rural development, because that meant you had to look at the sociological and cultural&#13;
factors as well as the economic ones. But then they thought of utopia and spoke of integrated rural&#13;
development, which meant everything in the rural community had to be brought together and&#13;
developed simultaneously. For a long while, that was the big thing. But that died aborning. And then&#13;
they turned to institutional development. The idea there was that what we needed were institutions&#13;
which could further development. Recently people have been returning to that idea. Then later on&#13;
they said basic needs was the key. And we turned out reams of reports on the basic needs of&#13;
developing countries. How they managed to ignore the only real way you develop a country--and as far&#13;
as I know, still ignore it--I do not know. Although some may deny it's ignored, I think that it hasn't&#13;
been faced. Development takes place in only one way, and that is by the development of the people of&#13;
the country, their skills, their abilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     At the end of the last war I was sent to Germany to help turn it into a pastoral nation. I was a staff&#13;
member of the Reparations Commission there, and when I looked at German devastation, I forecast&#13;
that it would take a hundred years before Germany could expect to be on its feet again. I see the smile&#13;
on your face. Of course, I was wrong, as I often have been, because of one thing. I forgot that&#13;
although all the machinery had been destroyed or taken by the Russians, alt~ough all the buildings&#13;
were down, the one thing Germany retained was a skilled manpower and labor force, and that's the&#13;
secret of development. It takes time to develop a skilled labor force. Mr. McNamara didn't have time.&#13;
And that's why to this day we have not faced up to the real road to economic development.&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                           -8-&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: Now, we can go to your illustrious career at EDI. You joined EDI in 1958, and at that&#13;
time I think you became totally involved in development planning. You published books on&#13;
development planning in Morocco, Pakistan and Yugoslavia. Can you give us in retrospect some idea&#13;
what influence development planning had on EDI techniques and what was its contribution to future&#13;
planning techniques?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Well, maybe I could best answer your question by going back to the point where&#13;
Gene Black twisted my arm and told me to go to the EDI where I would lecture, but also become the&#13;
Bank's expert on development planning. Now, I found myself in a position where the boss of the Bank&#13;
said I was an expert in planning because I had written a law which was a monstrous effusion. Of&#13;
course, at that time I blamed this on the Colombians for not carrying it out properly, figuring that I&#13;
knew what I was doing. We in the Bank had an extraordinary arrogance in those days. It came from&#13;
the fact that people were helpless in the countries we were in. Many of the countries are small,&#13;
whereas we were coming from Washington, which we thought of as the center of civilization and we&#13;
had money, and that made us brilliant! The worst thing about this was that the people with whom we&#13;
dealt in these countries actually accepted much of what we said, or at least kept quiet because they&#13;
distrusted themselves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     With that kind of a background, I was in an excellent position as a loan officer. Pictures taken by&#13;
newspaper photographers were reproduced in the papers when I arrived in Bogota; and the Minister of&#13;
Finance met me--just think of it--with his Cadillac and gave it to me to be driven around. It appeared&#13;
to me that I had enormous power. The President of the Republic saw me the first day I arrived, and I&#13;
told him what was wrong with his country. And he said, "Si, Senor." And he called the Minister of&#13;
Finance and said, "Por que no haces lo que dice Waterston? Why don't you do what Waterston says?"&#13;
And the Minister said, "Si, Senor." And that was the way we worked. Who wanted to give up that kind&#13;
of power? Of course, I didn't know what I was talking about half of the time, but it was a wonderful&#13;
feeling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I had come to the EDI and I'd been told, "You stand on your own. You are the planning man.&#13;
You write a book on planning." I didn't know anything about planning, of course. I had studied the&#13;
equations and mathematics of planning and in the Bank we came across a few of these things.&#13;
Planning was still a dirty word, so that you didn't really get involved in planning uuless you were told to,&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                          -9-&#13;
&#13;
[WATERSTON]&#13;
as in my case. What should I do? That's when I met you, because I decided that the place to go for an&#13;
answer was in the Archives of the World Bank. Now, that was one of the best decisions I've ever made,&#13;
because I found that you were sitting on a gold mine, and I began to mine it, as you know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: With the aid of an assistant I made lists of what each report said was going on in each&#13;
country with which the Bank dealt. I found they were doing badly, and I said, "These countries, they're&#13;
pretty hopeless. We've got to show them the way. They've got to follow the way.' To begin the&#13;
process I thought I would pick three countries, each one with its own idiosyncrasies of planning. One&#13;
was Yugoslavia, which had a very good reputation for planning, and had the virtue that it wasn't as&#13;
centralized as Soviet planning. In fact, it was a decentralized form of Soviet -style of planning. I chose&#13;
Yugoslavia first. The second country I chose to study was Pakistan, because the Harvard Advisory&#13;
Group had been there. They had turned out a piece of beautiful literature in the form of Pakistan's&#13;
first five-year plan, and I was very much taken with it. Here was the way planning should be done, I&#13;
thought. And the third country I chose, Morroco, used the French form of planning, and French&#13;
planning was at that time enjoying a great deal of esteem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So I began to write these three reports using the Bank's Archives materials. But it became obvious&#13;
while I was still gathering material that something was wrong with my original hypothesis. Because&#13;
when I collected enough data, I found that virtually every country in the world was failing to carry out&#13;
its plan. And so the thought occurred to me, as it had occurred to Oliver Cromwell when he said to&#13;
one of his committees, "I beseech ye, gentlemen, look inside your bowels and consider the possibility&#13;
you may be wrong.' And so I looked inside my bowels and said, "Something must be wrong with the&#13;
form of planning if it fails in almost every country. I've got to write this up!" And then the thought&#13;
occurred to me that if I wrote it up and caUed it the World Bank report, the countries would object. I&#13;
thought, too that the Bank might not let me report it. Let me tell you--I've never told this to&#13;
anybody--how I did it. I began to scour the printed literature of the UN, FAO, whatever had been&#13;
published, and if they mentioned anything about what was wrong with the planning they came across in&#13;
any country, I clipped and I cited that, expanding the ideas from your archives.&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                          -10-&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: I remember that because Gus [August T.] Shoemacher and I kept running after all the&#13;
development plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: He was of great help, by the way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: Yes, I remember.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: By the way, I've really not acknowledged your role. You have here a wealth of&#13;
information. I don't know whether anybody else has used it as I have, but I can tell you that if I were&#13;
back in the Bank, I would say the history you have is all the history you really need if you use it&#13;
constructively and well.&#13;

    The resulting magnum opus, Development Planning, is now in its seventh printing. Twenty years&#13;
after it was published it has sold I don't know how many copies. Do you know I still get calls from&#13;
around the world? I got one from Ghana recently, asking me to go there for the third time and show&#13;
them how to plan. It baffles me. But the data I used, you see, was the thing. It was superb. The only&#13;
agency which took 18 years to realize this was the World Bank, because for--am I anticipating your&#13;
question?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: The question would be what?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: How the Bank reacted to development planning as I had found it to be in the&#13;
developing countries?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: Oh, yes, that is the next question. I would like to mention only one thing that I believe&#13;
Mr. [Richard H.] Demuth, whose oral history inteview we have here, once said that you only realize&#13;
how much information is stored in the Bank records after you leave the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Luckily, I realized it before that time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: I myself think that when you do research, you're like a gold miner, you know. You're&#13;
panning for gold, and you never know where you might fmd it, so you have to pan every creek in the&#13;
region.&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                          -11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: And somewhere you'll find a nugget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Right. This was one of the troubles with Hollis Chenery's outfit. They sat and made&#13;
generalizations and deduced things from them and got statistics and manipulated them to the extent&#13;
needed to make their points. Whereas, those of us who learned to use the data found that the data told&#13;
us all we needed to build up to a conclusion that fit the realities. So that my magnum m       in 1965--this&#13;
was a very dangerous thing to do--really can be summarized in one sentence: Orthodox planning did&#13;
not work. I can assure you it was a shock to a lot of people, and it even frightened me, because I hadn't&#13;
started this enterprise with that hypothesis in mind. But that's what your data showed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: Did your magnum opus influence in any way the thinking of the Bank or did it influence in&#13;
any way the thinking of the economists in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Now, you come to a rather touchy subject. When I showed the draft to a committee&#13;
which Dick Demuth, who was my superior at the time, had brought together, one member, Willem&#13;
Brake!, said to me, "AI, they'll never let you publish this." "Well," I said, "Willem, they don't know&#13;
what's in the book and they don't care." And I was right. The book was published, and although this&#13;
sounds terrible, my name became known throughout the world as the exponent of the World Bank's&#13;
ideas about development planning. You know, when you're working for the World Bank and it&#13;
publishes a 700 page book, the world says, "This is the World Bank's ideas about planning." The book&#13;
became the best seller of the Bank, and I believe still is. But the one place it was not accepted was on&#13;
the 12th floor of the World Bank. Jack Maddux gave a copy to Mr. McNamara while he was still in the&#13;
Department of Defense and then told me, "I gave him a copy of your book and you should expect to&#13;
hear from him." Not only did I not hear from McNamara; throughout his entire tenure in office, I&#13;
never met him.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: But if I recall correctly, after you published the book, somehow among the staff of the&#13;
Bank you got the nickname the Pope of Plenty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Yes.&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                         -12-&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: That was not meant in ridicule, but as a recognition of the great importance that you&#13;
placed on planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: This is more about the nature of the Bank under McNamara. McNamara had made&#13;
it clear that he was a devotee of orthodox plans, which my book said did not work. Well, when the boss&#13;
says that, everybody goes low key. But when they ran into a problem in planning, which occurred all&#13;
over the world, my colleagues in the Bank would call me and say, "Would you be willing to join our&#13;
mission to such and such a country and give us your ideas on what needs to be done?" Because of this&#13;
calls I had been set up within the World Bank as its advisor on development planning. Incidentally, I&#13;
was the frrst technical assistance man, full time, which the Bank had on any subject. And planning was&#13;
a brand new one. Advisor on Development Planning, that was my title. When they called me, I went,&#13;
and I went with different teams and on my own to 18 different countries. When they had tried to set&#13;
me up as an expert on planning--this was again when Black was still here--he said, "Well now, you're&#13;
going to be an expert on planning for the Bank." And I remember replaying: "I'm an expert on&#13;
planning that doesn't work well. That's what my book is all about." 'Well," he said, "you'd better learn&#13;
what works." So I began to think in positive terms, and I did this by going to a total of 18 countries and&#13;
publishing the results in the form of country reports, which laid the basis for my own evolution in&#13;
planning procedures which did work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Officially the Bank had two positions. One was that of McNamara and the top staff like Hollis&#13;
Chenery, which was that the only kind of planning was econometric planning. You set up the model;&#13;
you set the investment rate; you determined the amount of investment; you devised a capital/output&#13;
ratio. If these terms are not understandable to you, let me tell you that for a moment I thought I&#13;
understood them myself, but only for a moment. Because it did not work in most of the countries.&#13;
This was because the problems there were political, administrative and very often human. And these&#13;
were the problems I tackled when I went the different countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So you had frrst the econometric model building, which the whole Chenery staff was supporting&#13;
and down below, on the operational level, the economists rather surreptitiously were calling me in to&#13;
tell them what to do with the plans which weren't working. You had this schizophrenia in the Bank. At&#13;
no time during the McNamara period did the top staff ever acknowledge that the plans couldn't work.&#13;
The problem from their point of view was the countries. They had to be forced into the model, and if&#13;
they didn't do that, it was the country's fault. In contrast, my contention was that the models were&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                          -13-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(WATERSTONJ&#13;
fme, but that you had to start from the level of the people and take into account the political instability&#13;
in these countries. And instead of drawing up 10-year plans, which many of these countries did--not&#13;
one of which was ever be carried out--you had to start with one-year plans and in some cases with&#13;
sector planning instead of overall planing. Gradually I moved more and more into agriculture because&#13;
I saw that that's where the people were, and thars where they had to be taught planned management,&#13;
and that's were you had to begin. But I found no recognition of that on top until much later, because&#13;
institutions do move like elephants. I feared the Bank was going to move like a dinosaur and become&#13;
extinct, but it was never as bad as I thought. Eventually they saw that agriculture is the key, so the&#13;
Bank moved into it. But they never got to the point of really recognizing that it wasn't a question of the&#13;
crops. It wasn't agriculture m   ~.   It was the farmer, and the enormous gap between the plans being&#13;
made by others for the farmer and the farmer's ability to do what the plan called for. The problem was&#13;
that they were planning from the top down, whereas I had learned to plan from the bottom up. I went&#13;
into a country with the missions and began with the farmers and met with the farmers. And that is&#13;
where the EDI's true value came out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The EDI, especially under [Sir Alexander] Cairncross and under Mike Hoffman, was a quality&#13;
institution with a quality group of Fellows who came there to learn. They were people with great&#13;
potential. And when they dispersed to their countries, almost invariably they became top officials.&#13;
When I'd go into the country, the first person I would seek out was the nearest EDI Fellow and say,&#13;
"Bring them all together." And when we met, we did not encounter the kind of problems that the&#13;
typical World Bank man had. We were fellow sufferers from political instability, from bureaucracy,&#13;
from administrative problems, and we laid everything out and in one day I was informed by these&#13;
experts about everything that was wrong with their plans. I would write my reports and give solutions&#13;
which actually came from these people. The EDI "mafia" was one of the most wonderful things the&#13;
Bank ever created, and what is more they always made time for us when we came in, provided I didn't&#13;
bring in anybody who was not an EDI man, because they didn't want to tell the Bank loan officers what&#13;
they were telling me. They knew I would protect them, and they protected me by giving me the truth. I&#13;
met them in the Sudan, in Ghana, and in the coountries of Latin America, and Asia. I needed ouly a&#13;
few days in each country because I had access to two treasures. The first one was the Bank's archives.&#13;
The second one was the body of EDI Fellows. In my view, the EDI, because it came close to the&#13;
people, has done more for development than the Bank recognizes. It has been a stupendous force.&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                          -14-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: Do you feel it is now the same?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Of course, my information about that is poor. I retired from the Bank in 1972, and&#13;
although I keep in touch peripherally, my interests now lie in another direction, and consequently I&#13;
really don't feel qualified to speak about the present situation. But from what I have heard I would&#13;
doubt it, although I am prepared to modify this opinion on the basis of additional information. The&#13;
reason I doubt it is that they're going back to doing things which we did years ago and found wanting.&#13;
They are starting, for example, with institution building again when what you need to have is people&#13;
building. As I said before, people constitute the secret force of development. You must build up the&#13;
labor force. But it doesn't mean, as Servan-Schreiber put it, that instead of giving people a fish, you&#13;
have to teach them how to fish. You have to go beyond that. You have to ask people instead: "What&#13;
do you want to do? Do you want to fish or plow a field or do something else?' In other words, you&#13;
have to start with the people's wishes. In my experience, the Bank never learned to do that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: Well, maybe one of these days we will.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Oh, I think the Bank has done wonders. It has developed people. It has helped&#13;
economic development, but it hasn't come to grips with this essential problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: Okay, they say that our Bank now is in a state of change, that new ideas of development&#13;
assistance have taken the place of old ones. We can see that more emphasis has now been put on&#13;
certain different aspects of economic development. Now, what are your views and what kind of future&#13;
do you see for the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: I see indeed that the Bank is changing. I saw it in 1976 when, just before I retired&#13;
from The American University as Professor of Economics, I gave a lecture at the University about&#13;
basic needs and why that idea was sure to fail. I said that it was sure to fail because it was no longer&#13;
possible to look at economic development as a subject by itself. Now, because of changes in the world&#13;
political, economic and social situation, you had to start with that totality and then move into economic&#13;
development. And I said at that time that I sometimes felt that I was in an elevator--economic&#13;
development was the elevator--which was going up on a ship which was sinking--the world political&#13;
economy. And I said this because I saw that we had overloaded the under-developed countries,&#13;
particularly Latin America, with loans they would never be able to repay. That was visible in 1976.&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                          -15-&#13;
&#13;
[WATERSTON]&#13;
Today it's beginning to be accepted, although not much. I saw too that we were entering a stage of&#13;
rearmament. I saw thirdly that unemployment--and by unemployment I mean secular unemployment,&#13;
not cyclical unemployment--was going to go up steadily and that this was true because we had solved&#13;
the production problem in the world. We were paying farmers not to produce, paying farmers not to&#13;
produce, and we were curtailing industries. The world had become one market, Japanese automobiles&#13;
could be produced for $1,200 to $1,700 less than an American automobile, and unless something was&#13;
done, a lot of industries would go down. Finally, all of these things and two more things, which I don't&#13;
have time to go into now, but will be glad in the future, will mean that the industrial countries will not&#13;
have enough money to provide development assistance for the simple reason that their own poor are&#13;
getting poorer and it was politically impossible not to deal with that problem. Consequently, you had&#13;
to begin with this situation and say, "What changes do you expect in the World Bank?" The World&#13;
Bank was bloated during the McNamara years by a staff which today is not needed in large part. The&#13;
Bank has less money, and what is more, will continue to have less money, but a golden opportunity now&#13;
arises. If they combine their projects with people development, you don't need so much money.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: It's all to the people, right?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: That's right. And, therefore, you need to change your staff to the kinds of people that&#13;
can do that job. And what an opportunity! Now, I have confidence that the World Bank will see&#13;
that--if it hasn't already. Why? Because you can close your eyes to reality only for so long, and then&#13;
when the situation persists, you see it. So the world situation determines the future of the World Bank&#13;
today to an extent never before, but I see that as an opportunity. With less money, without the staff it&#13;
now has, if you enable them to become technical--I'm afraid I must quit expounding my ideas at this&#13;
point.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: You served under many Presidents actually. You are a rarity among the staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: You saw [John J.] McCloy, Black, Woods and McNamara. You talked about McNamara a&#13;
little bit. What can you tell us about McCloy and Black and Woods?&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                          -16-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Well, I would say to you that McCloy--Jack McCloy was President when I came into&#13;
the Bank--would have made a great President, but he was pulled out to become American High&#13;
Commissioner in Germany. But not before he had brought the beginnings of an outstanding staff.&#13;
People like Dave [Davidson) Sommers and other top people he had brought together. This was an&#13;
enormously important thing, but he left so soon--after a year or so. Â·And then came the greatest leader&#13;
the Bank has ever had--Gene Black. Here was a man from the south, presumably filled with narrow&#13;
views that southerners of the United States were supposed to have, who had become a banker in New&#13;
York at Chase Manhattan and was really a bond salesman--supposedly not very dynamic. But, oh, how&#13;
wrong everybody was, because Gene Black was people-oriented naturally, and he was a leader you&#13;
would follow anywhere in the world. He had his biases, but he was willing to change slowly, if you&#13;
pushed him gently. And when I was loan officer of Colombia, you know who in the Bank made the&#13;
decisions in Colombia? I did, because Gene Black said, "AI, if you say we stop lending, we will stop&#13;
lending." Just think of that. What do you do with a President like that who calls and says that?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    One day he and I went to the Colombian Embassy to see the Minister of Finance. Black didn't&#13;
speak Spanish. And the Colombian Minister of Finance said in Spanish, "Mr. Black, I am here to tell&#13;
you that Colombia places great confidence in the World Bank. It is true that you have stopped lending&#13;
to us, but I want you to know that we expect to do everything we need to do, and in the meantime we&#13;
want you"--and he kept on talking in this vein for a while, and afterward I turned to Black and I said,&#13;
"He wants a loan." Black replied, "Tell him no." In Spanish, I said, "Mr. Minister, Mr. Black is most&#13;
interested in your account of Colombia and your plans for it. We in turn want you to know that we&#13;
have confidence in Colombia and we hope to be able at the proper time and place to"--and Black&#13;
tapped me on the hand and asked, "AI, how long does it take to say no in Spanish?" I replied, "A little&#13;
longer than it does in English." And when we left that meeting after saying no, and he said to me as we&#13;
rode in his car back to the Bank, "AI, there's a motion picture I want to see. It's called Baby Doll.&#13;
Would you come with me?" And we went to see the movie together on F Street. What do you think of&#13;
a leader like that?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: All right, now, playing baseball ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WATERSTON: Oh yes. He played basel;&gt;all at our picnics with a fedora hat because he had a bald&#13;
head he wanted to protect from the sun, and he played without a jacket.&#13;
&amp;#12;WATERSTON                                          -17-&#13;
&#13;
[WATERSTON)&#13;
    Then came Woods. Outside the Bank he really continued the conventional banking loans we had&#13;
always made, more or less. Within the Bank he adopted a confrontational approach. He believed that&#13;
you get the best results out of the staff by insulting them publicly, and things like that. NaturaUy this it&#13;
did not set weD with the Bank staff and the esprit !I!; corns feU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Then came McNamara. Now McNamara, a very good planner, was totally task oriented. Totally.&#13;
Not people oriented. And he set the task of doubling loans in five years from which he never deviated,&#13;
and he thought that that would bring economic development. And it did, but not nearly to the extent it&#13;
could have if he had encouraged people-building.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHOKEL: Thank you very much, Mr. Waterston, for this most interesting interview.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In May 1985, Albert Waterston was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Bogomir Chokel. During his tenure at the
            Bank from 1947 to 1972, Mr. Waterston worked in the
            following areas: in the loan department as an assistant loan
            officer (1947); in the economics department (1948-1953); in
            the department of operations for the western hemisphere
            (1953-1957); at the Economic Development Institute (EDI)
            (1958-1961); in the development services department
            (1962-1968); at EDI as a lecturer on general development for
            French, Spanish and education courses (1969-1971); at EDI as
            a lecturer (1971-1972) and as a senior lecturer (1972) on
            agriculture, rural development and general projects.
            Throughout his 25 years with the World Bank, Mr. Waterston
            was deeply involved in development planning. His transcript
            concerns the economic development in Mexico and the World
            Bank under Robert McNamara.
