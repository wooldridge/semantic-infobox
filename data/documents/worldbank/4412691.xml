&#13;
                             I.PROGRAMPERFORMANCE:OVERALL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      1. Macroeconomic Framework. The Argentina economy continues its strong recovery&#13;
     following the 2002 crisis. The economy grew 8.7 percent in 2003. The official GDP growth&#13;
     projections for 2004 have been revised upward to the 5.5-8.0 percent range. In the first&#13;
     quarter of 2004, GDP grew at a 10.5 percent rate. Other real sector indicators such as&#13;
     consumer and business confidence indexes continue to register strong gains. The recovery&#13;
     has been led by sectors that benefited from the positive stimulus on production of the&#13;
     devaluation following abandonment of the currency board, as well as the large output gap&#13;
     caused by the crisis and the long recession which preceded it. As encouraging as the&#13;
     recovery is, it must be put into perspective. Real GDP in 2003 was at about the level of 1996&#13;
     inrealterms andstill 11percentbelow its peakin 1998before the crisis'.&#13;
&#13;
     2. Key to the recovery has been control of the fiscal situation as well as prudent monetary&#13;
     policy. The consolidated public sector generateda primary surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP in&#13;
     2003, one half percent above the program target, and is on track to meet or exceed the&#13;
     primary surplus target of 3 percent of GDP set for 2004. This good performance mainly&#13;
     results from better-than-anticipated revenues; expendituresare also rising, but at a slower rate&#13;
     than revenues. Strong fiscal performance has underpinned the success of monetary policy in&#13;
     establishing a virtuous cycle of subdued inflation, lower interest rates, currency stability and&#13;
     higher international reserves. The 12-monthCPI inflation rate stood at 4.3 percent as of May&#13;
     2004, compared to 3.7 percent at the end of 2003 and 41 percent at end-2002. The monetary&#13;
     program remains on track as growth in the money supply has kept pace with the economic&#13;
     recovery, reflecting a renewed demand for pesos in line with improving confidence. The&#13;
     peso i s currently trading ina tight range of AR$/US$2.9 and the Central Bank's international&#13;
     reserves reached nearly US$17 billion in June 2004 compared to US$10.5 billion at end-&#13;
     2002. Since end-2002, the exchange rate has appreciated by 16 percent in real effective&#13;
     terms, but still remains 49 percent below its value when the convertibility plan was&#13;
     abandoned.       Under the program for monetary unification, effectively all federal and&#13;
     provincialquasi-monies were recoveredby February 2004.&#13;
&#13;
     3. The devaluation has generated a sharp and persistent turnaround in Argentina's external&#13;
     balance. The current account shifted from a deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2001 to a&#13;
     massive surplus (even after accounting for accrued interest due on non-performing debt) of&#13;
     9.5 percent of GDP in 2002 and 6.0 percent in 2003. This turnaround was driven by a near&#13;
    tripling of the external trade balance in US Dollar terms, underpinned by an extraordinary&#13;
    compression of imports which fell from US$20 billion in 2001 to US$9 billion in 2002.&#13;
    While imports have begun to bounce back with the recovery, export revenues have also&#13;
    remained strong given high commodity prices and buoyant external demand, especially in&#13;
&#13;
' The culmination of the crisis is associatedwith the collapse of the convertibility plan in December 2001 which&#13;
extracted a finally unsustainably highsocial and economic cost. For an evaluation of the causes of the crisis, see&#13;
"Argentina: A Retrospective Review", distributed to the Board in July 2002.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 soy. In the capital account, the buildup of international reserves reflects a moderation in&#13;
 private capital outflows (including capital flight) from peak crisis levels and the continued&#13;
 accumulation of arrears on the defaulted external debt.&#13;
&#13;
 4. The recovery has begun to have a positive impact on living standards as shown by the&#13;
 steady improvement in key social indicators since the crisis in 2002.          However, the&#13;
 improvement i s from a very low base and large segments of the Argentine population&#13;
 continue to face great hardship. The unemployment rate has declined from the levels of 24.1&#13;
 percent reachedduring the crisis to 19.7percent currently (14.5 percent if the beneficiaries of&#13;
 the JefedJefuas de Hogar program are classified as employed). Inparallel, real wages in the&#13;
 private sector have been trending upward, although still well below pre-crisis levels. The&#13;
 combined impact of higher employment and real wages has begun to bringdown the poverty&#13;
 rate which shot up to levels of over 50 percentduring2002.&#13;
&#13;
 5. The Government has taken steps to move forward with restructuring of the sovereign&#13;
 debt in default. InMarch 2004, the Government appointed a committee of international and&#13;
 domestic banks to assist with the debt restructuring operation and held meetings with creditor&#13;
 groups in April. In early June, the Government announced additional details about its&#13;
restructuring proposal. The new announcement proposes to retain the 75 percent reduction&#13;
 ("haircut") in the nominal face value of the principal, proposed originally in Dubai in&#13;
 September 2003, but recognizes past-due interest. The restructured bonds would include an&#13;
additional interest payment linked to GDP growth. According to the Government, in net&#13;
present value terms, the proposal would amount to a haircut on the order of 75 percent of the&#13;
total debt in default to private creditors-still unprecedented for middle income countries.&#13;
Despite the welcome progress on the process, the fundamental differences in position&#13;
betweenthe Government and its defaulted private creditors remain unresolved.&#13;
&#13;
6. The recovery has been accompanied by support from the international financial&#13;
institutions. In September 2003, the IMF approved a three year, US$12.5 billion stand-by&#13;
arrangement. The first review under the new Fundprogram was completed inJanuary 2004&#13;
and the second review was completed in March. The second review found that all end-&#13;
December 2003 quantitative performance criteria were met comfortably.          The third IMF&#13;
review is now scheduled for July 2004. Support has also been forthcoming from the Inter-&#13;
American Development Bank (IDB). The IDB Boarddiscussed inMay its country assistance&#13;
strategy including a US$5 billion lending programover 4 years.&#13;
&#13;
7. While Argentina has taken major strides to emerge from the crisis, serious risks and&#13;
vulnerabilities remain which will continue to test policymakers. On the macroeconomic&#13;
front, the recovery has been aided by an exceptionally benign external environment marked&#13;
byrecord low interest ratesand boomingcommodity prices. As the businesscycle maturesin&#13;
the major OECD countries, particularly the United States, Argentina will have to cope with&#13;
the impact of rising international interest rates which could have important regional&#13;
implications as well. Domestically, macroeconomic policy will need to manage a potential&#13;
rise in inflationary pressures and increasing demands to spend windfall fiscal revenues. The&#13;
Government i s planning on significant increases in investment to address infrastructure&#13;
bottlenecks and bring the overall investment to GDP ratio back up to historical trends.&#13;
However, fiscal constraints will continue to place severe limits on increases in public&#13;
investment and a return of private investment will be critical. The Government has not yet&#13;
been able to restore access to international financial markets and foreign direct investment&#13;
remains depressed. Early warning signals such as the current energy supply problems and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
narrowing output gap underscore the importance of action on the structural agenda to sustain&#13;
growth over the mediumterm.&#13;
&#13;
8. Social Priorities. Given record levels of poverty and a worsening income distribution, a&#13;
top priority for the Government is to strengthen the effectiveness of social programs in order&#13;
to maximize the impact of planned increases in social spending. Insocial assistance, efforts&#13;
have been taken to strengthen enforcement of eligibility criteria for participation in social&#13;
transfer programs. The Government i s also preparing an integrated transition plan to move&#13;
from emergency social programs in response to the crisis to a more service-oriented, tailor-&#13;
made social policy that promotes employment. Ineducation, steps are underway to improve&#13;
performance including targeting under-performing schools, setting performance standards&#13;
and passingfederal legislation which sets a minimum180school days.&#13;
&#13;
9. HealthSector ProgramImplementation.There continues to be satisfactory progress in&#13;
the implementation of the health sector reform and investment program. Recently, the vast&#13;
majority of the provinces approved the Federal Health Plan--a plan containing the medium&#13;
and long term vision for the sector at national and provincial level, including strengthening&#13;
the Federal Health Council (COFESA) which is key to ensure health policy coordination in&#13;
Argentina's federal context characterized by a historically high degree of policy&#13;
fragmentation. The plan was presentedand endorsedby PresidentKirchner on May 24,2004.&#13;
&#13;
10. The Ministry of Health (MoH) continues to implement at a fast pace the health sector&#13;
reform, particularly the start up of the Maternal and Child Health Insurance Program&#13;
(MCHIP), which is the key pillar of the reform. All nine provinces in the North-Eastern&#13;
(MA) and North-Western (NOA) regions of the country have already created the MCHIP&#13;
management unitsand the enrollment system has been designedand tested in the province of&#13;
Jujuy. The Ministry of Health continues implementation of key sector reforms including the&#13;
establishment of an expedite billing system from public hospitals to Social Insurance&#13;
Organizations (Obras Sociales) to improve targeting of public subsidies, and the inclusion of&#13;
sexual and reproductive services. The Government has provided the necessary resources for&#13;
all priority health programs including HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, tuberculosis&#13;
prevention andtreatment, essential medication programs, and other programs.&#13;
&#13;
11. On April 15, 2004, the Board of Directors approved the Provincial Maternal-Child&#13;
Investment Project (Loan No 7225-AR, a three phase APL with a first phase amounting&#13;
US$135.8 million), which will support scaling up of the MCHIP first to the nine northern&#13;
provinces and then to the entire country.&#13;

12. General Condition. The status of the two general conditions associated with the Loan is&#13;
as follows:&#13;
&#13;
        a) The macroeconomicfiamework of the Borrower is consistent with the objectives&#13;
            of the Program. This condition is met as a result of the assessment of the&#13;
            country's macroeconomic performance inparagraphs 1to 7 above.&#13;
        b) The Borrower has achievedprogress satisfactory to the Bank in the carrying out&#13;
            of the Program. Thisconditionis met. Paragraphs9 to 11above summarize the&#13;
            status of the implementation of the program. The program is described in the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
              Letter of Sector Policy adopted by the Government on September 5, 2003,&#13;
              available as annex 1of the PMCHSAL ProgramDocument (No 26527-AR).&#13;
&#13;
 13. Specific Sector Conditions for SecondTranche Release. Government performance in&#13;
meetingeach of the 10specific conditions for secondtranche releasei s described below.&#13;
&#13;
 14. Condition 1. COFESA has agreed (with the approval oj at least, two thirds of the&#13;
COFESA Representatives)on a healthplan (saidplan to include a maternal and child health&#13;
insuranceprogram) to be implemented by the Borrower, the Provinces and the autonomous&#13;
city of Buenos Aires. This condition is met. The Federal Health Council (COFESA)&#13;
approved on March 31, 2004, by more than two thirds of its members, the Federal Health&#13;
Plan. Copies of the duly signed agreement were submitted by the government. The plan,&#13;
which explicitly supports the implementation of M C H P as the basis for future provincial&#13;
health insurance for the uninsured, was formally endorsed and presented by President&#13;
Kirchner to the public on May 24,2004. The FederalHealth Plan sets forth a long term vision&#13;
on public health policy and priorities and contributes significantly to a more coordinated&#13;
healthpolicy inArgentina.&#13;
&#13;
 15. Condition2. COFESA has establishedapublic information system (which system shall&#13;
include a web page accessiblethrough the internet) to disseminate to the public COFESA's&#13;
public accords, resolutions, decisions and recommendations, including but not limited to the&#13;
topics in the agenda discussed or to be discussed at COFESA meetings. This condition is&#13;
met. COFESA has set, through the National Ministry of Health, a web site which includes&#13;
up-todate information on accords, agreements,discussionagendas and recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
16. Condition3. The Borrower has allocated in its national annual budget law (Cdculo de&#13;
Recursos y Presupuesto de Gastosde la Administracio'nPliblica Nacional),for calendar year&#13;
2004 (as approved by the Borrower's legislature and adjusted by the Borrower based on the&#13;
budget implementation powers granted to the Borrower by Article 37 of Law 24.156), an&#13;
amount of at least AR$548,300,000for the Essential Health Programs (including an amount&#13;
of at least AR$20,000,000 for the MCHIP). This condition is met. The Government&#13;
presentedsatisfactory evidence that it has allocated AR$548.3 million for the implementation&#13;
of priority health programs, including AR$20 million for the start-up of the MCHIP. The&#13;
government included in the initial budget law approved by congress an amount of&#13;
AR$545,821,211 (that included the AR$20 million for MCHIP). In March this year, in&#13;
accordanceto its legal prerogatives as set forth by article 37 of Law 24.156, the Government&#13;
re-allocated resourcesfrom other programs to complete the total amount of AR$548.3 million&#13;
For purposes of monitoring availability and use of funds for priority programs, the&#13;
Government and the Bank agreedto monitor these budget lines on a monthly basis.&#13;
&#13;
17. Condition4. MSN has issued a resolutionapproving an operational manual (satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank)for the implementation of the MCHIP, and said resolution is in fill force and&#13;
effect. This condition is met. A final version of the Operational Manual of the MCHP,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, has been presented by the Government on May 24, 2004. The M o H&#13;
has also issued Resolution No 9, from the M o H Secretary of Sanitary Programs duly&#13;
approving and issuing the Manual. The Secretary is the highest operational authority at the&#13;
MoHdirectly responsible for MCHIP implementation at the MoH.&#13;
&#13;
18. Condition5. a)At least four (4) Eligible Provinces have issued a Decree or            a&#13;
Resolution, as the case may be, establishing a separate MCHIP management unit in each of&#13;
said provinces; (b) the provinces mentioned in (a) herein have structured and staffed said&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 units in accordance with the provisions of the Operational Manual; and (c) the Decrees&#13;
 a d o r Resolutions referred to in (a) herein, as the case may be, are infill force and effect.&#13;
 This conditionis met. All nine eligible provinces inthe North-Eastern and North-Western&#13;
 regions have issued decrees or resolutions, satisfactory to the Bank, creating the separate&#13;
 MCHIP unitsand all of themare in full force. Five of them (Misiones, Catamarca,Formosa,&#13;
 Corrientes and Santiago del Estero) have fully staffed the units in accordance to the&#13;
 provisions of the Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
 19. Condition 6. The Borrower has designed a system to identify and afiliate uninsured&#13;
 women and children under the MCHIP, and said system has been implemented and is filly&#13;
 operational in at least one (I)Eligible Province. This conditionis met. A Bank mission&#13;
 visited the province of Jujuy (one of the nine eligible provinces) on May 21, 2004 and&#13;
 confirmed that the pilot enrolment system has been designed and is fully operational in&#13;
 place, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, and i s ready to begin enrollment in that province&#13;
 and the other eight provinces. The system has been installed and has been pilot tested in key&#13;
 public health facilities including a primary health care center (Villa Belgrano, Jujuy), two&#13;
 public hospitals (Hospital Sun Rope and Hospital Pablo Soria, Jujuy) and in the MCHIP&#13;
 offices at the Jujuy Ministry of Health for consolidation and verification purposes. Together&#13;
 with the system, the Government presented the Operational Manual of the system as well as&#13;
 its training manuals. The system will serve as the basis for the enrolment targets which&#13;
 constitutes a condition for third tranche release. Furthermore, the system is the basis for the&#13;
 implementation of the capitation transfers included under the recently approved Provincial&#13;
 Matemal-ChildInvestment Project.&#13;
&#13;
 20. Condition 7. The health services referred to in article 6 (a) through (c) of the&#13;
 Borrower's Law 25.673 have been included in the PMO, and are available to beneficiaries of&#13;
 the National Health Insurance Entities. This condition is met. The National Ministry of&#13;
Health issued a resolution (Resolution No 310/2004 signed and issued by the National&#13;
Minister of Health on April 7, 2004) mandating the inclusion of the health services included&#13;
 inthe Borrower's Law 25.673, in the Mandatory HealthPlan (Plan Medico Obligatorio) of&#13;
the National Health Insurance Entities (OSN). The Resolution is satisfactory including all&#13;
 services and providing a mandate to the National Superintendence of Health Services. As per&#13;
this mandate, the National Superintendenceof Health Services has issuedregulation and has&#13;
 set the procedures enforcing such compliance by OSNs.&#13;
&#13;
21. Condition8. TheBorrower's executive branch has issued a Decreefor the elimination of&#13;
all institutional subsidies (Subsidios Institucionales) granted to National Health Insurance&#13;
Entities throughAPE, and said decree is infill force and effect. This conditionis met. The&#13;
President issued Decree No 213/2004 from the National Executive Branch eliminating all&#13;
institutional subsidies (Subsidios Institucionales) granted to the National Health Entities&#13;
through the Special Programs Agency (APE) and said decree i s in full force. The decree is&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank and confirms and consolidates the precedent regulation eliminating&#13;
these subsidies which had createdperverse incentives for the efficiency and sustainability of&#13;
OSNs inthe past.&#13;
&#13;
22. Condition9. At least three (3) of the Five Largest Public Hospitals in each of at least&#13;
four (4) Eligible Provinces have established a filly finctioning and updated database of&#13;
beneficiaries of National Health InsuranceEntities and Obras SocialesProvinciales (OSP)in&#13;
the admission point to each hospital. This condition is met. The Government submitted&#13;
satisfactory evidence that three of the five largest public hospitals in at least four eligible&#13;
provinces (Misiones, Tucuman,Salta and Chaco) have functioning and updated databases at&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the admission point of the hospital. The 12 hospitals are: a) inMisiones province, Hospital de&#13;
Pediatria Posadas, Hospital el Dorado and Hospital Obera; b) in Salta, Hospital del&#13;
Milagro, Hospital Sun Bemardo and Hospital Matemo Infantil (de Ninos); c) in Chaco,&#13;
Hospital Avelino Castelan,Hospital Julio Perrando and Hospital Salvador Mazza; and d) in&#13;
Tucuman, Hospital Santillan,Hosptal del Nino Jesus and Hospital Padilla. A Bank mission&#13;
inspected the systems inthe field for two eligible hospitals inone randomly selected province&#13;
out of the four presented by the government. The mission selected the Salta province and&#13;
visited Hospital Sun Bemardo and Hospital del Milagro. Additionally, the mission also&#13;
visited two the systems in two hospitals in the Jujuy province (Hospitals Pablo Soria and&#13;
Hospital Sun Rogue), which, although not presentedby the government as part of the group&#13;
of four provinces, also presented fully functional systems. The database systems in place&#13;
allow the provinces not only to ensure targeting of the MCHIP through identifying non-&#13;
MCHIP members, but also to bill the national and provincial health insurers for services&#13;
rendered to their beneficiaries, effectively increasing targeting of overall public subsidies on&#13;
the non-insured poor.&#13;
&#13;
23. Condition10.A system to expedite thepayment of invoices whichpublic health services&#13;
providerspresent to National Health Insurance Entities throughthe Superintendence or other&#13;
agency of the Borrower, isfully functional in at leastfive (5) of the Eligible Provinces. This&#13;
condition is met. The Government submitted satisfactory evidence that the MoH has&#13;
implemented, through the Superintendence, a system to expedite the payment of invoices&#13;
which public health service providers present to OSNs in five eligible provinces. The&#13;
provinces include Chaco, Jujuy, Misiones, Salta and Tucuman. A Bank mission also&#13;
confirmed the effective functioning of the system in the field through visiting four randomly&#13;
selected public Hospitals in two eligible provinces. The four Hospitals in the field visit&#13;
included Hospitals Pablo Soria and Hospital Sun Rogue in the Jujuy province, and Hospital&#13;
Sun Bemardo and Hospital del Milagro in Salta province. The system to expedite payment&#13;
can significantly increase cost-recovery from OSNs (currently at less than 30 percent of its&#13;
estimated potential), ensuring a better targeting of public subsidies to the non-insured poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   111. CONCLUSION&#13;
&#13;
24. Inview of the overall satisfactory performance and progress with the implementation of&#13;
the programsupportedby the Loan, including the macroeconomic framework and the specific&#13;
conditions of release referred in Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement, the Bank has informed&#13;
the Borrower of the availability for disbursement of the second tranche of the Loan in the&#13;
equivalent of US$lSO million.&#13;

            Argentina - Provincial Maternal-Child
            Health Sector Adjustment Loan Project : Release of second
            tranche - full compliance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Argentina's economy continues its
            strong recovery following the 2002 crisis, where key to this
            recovery has been control of the fiscal situation, as well
            as prudent monetary policy. Under the program for monetary
            unification, effectively all federal and provincial
            quasi-monies were recovered by February 2004, with the
            devaluation generating a sharp, and persistent turnaround in
            Argentina's external balance. The status of the two
            general conditions associated with the Provincial
            Maternal-Child Health Sector Adjustment Loan Project is as
            follows: a) the macroeconomic framework of the Borrower is
            consistent with the objectives of the Program. This
            condition is met as a result of the assessment of the
            country's macroeconomic performance; and, b) the
            Borrower has achieved progress satisfactory to the Bank in
            implementing the Program. This condition has also been met.
            Given the overall satisfactory performance, and progress
            with the implementation of the program supported by the
            Loan, including the macroeconomic framework, and the
            specific conditions of release, disbursement of the second
            tranche of the Loan is available in the equivalent of US$
            150 million.
