Public-Private Partnerships&#13;
For Small Piped Water Schemes&#13;
This field note reviews the first generation of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for small piped water&#13;
schemes in seven countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda and Senegal. The&#13;
field note proposes a framework for moving towards more sustainable piped water PPPs. The framework&#13;
comprises four building blocks to consider: improving contracting practices, the enabling environment,&#13;
the capacity of the PPP stakeholders, and information tools and services.&#13;

                                                The basic mobile-2-web performance monitoring service in Senegal aims to improve&#13;
                                                ASUFOR (CBO operators) management of small water schemes. It was developed&#13;
                                                by a Senegalese ICT provider, Manobi SA, in partnership with the Water Ministry's&#13;
                                                Directorate of Operation and Maintenance. This service uses a dedicated mobile phone&#13;
                                                with an application ­ mWater ­ which allows a water scheme manager to forward&#13;
                                                weekly information from a mobile phone. The information covers: (i) the bulk water&#13;
                                                meter index, (ii) the saving and current account balances of the ASUFOR, and (iii) the&#13;
                                                number of days when the service is not available. An alert function is integrated into&#13;
                                                the telephone which allows the manager to report the malfunction by SMS to the local&#13;

            A review of progress in seven African
            countries : public-private partnerships for small piped
            water schemes

            This field note reviews the first
            generation of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for small
            piped water schemes in seven countries: Benin, Burkina Faso,
            Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda and Senegal. The field note
            proposes a framework for moving towards more sustainable
            piped water PPPs. The framework comprises four building
            blocks to consider: improving contracting practices, the
            enabling environment, the capacity of the PPP stakeholders,
            and information tools and services. The purpose of the field
            note is to identify key lessons and success factors from the
            first generation of PPPs in the rural and small town water
            sector in Africa to guide countries in their development of
            national PPP action plans and to inform the implementation
            of Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) Sustainable Services
            through Domestic Private Sector Participation (SS-DPSP) initiative.
