Mobilizing Resources&#13;
for Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Finding effective ways to promote and pay for urban sanitation remains a major challenge. Burkina&#13;
Faso, in West Africa, has made substantial progress through the careful use of a small surcharge&#13;
on the water bill.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  Burkina Faso in West Africa has adopted an approach to stimulate demand for sanitation, and&#13;
  then meet that demand through small scale providers. This strategy aims to develop a&#13;
  sustainable urban sanitation industry by creating and developing the capacity to meet long-term&#13;
  demand.&#13;

Since 1998, Burkina Faso has been&#13;
involved in a decentralization process&#13;
which has given local authorities (the&#13;
province and the commune) more&#13;
responsibility for sanitation. This&#13;
institutional framework will, in the&#13;
short run, help to define ONEA's&#13;
mission in the national sanitation&#13;
strategy. A partnership will be&#13;
established between ONEA and the&#13;
communes based upon performance&#13;
requirements for use of the sanitation&#13;
surcharge. It is important to ensure&#13;
that the surcharge continues to be&#13;

management and that its funds can be&#13;

            Financing urban sanitation is a global
            challenge with few sustainable success stories in developing
            countries. Burkina Faso has achieved more positive results
            than most countries through its policy of adding a
            sanitation services levy on all water bills since 1985.
            Utilization of these fees to support on-site sanitation in
            two cities of Burkina Faso started in the 1990s, and showed
            how leveraging is effective in facilitating household
            investment in the sector. The following aspects of the
            surcharge have contributed to the success in spurring
            sanitation investment: The levy and use of the surcharge by
            an operationally and financially viable organization; the
            direct transfer of surcharge revenues to a dedicated
            sanitation account, without the intervention of central
            government; the focus on sanitation promotion rather than
            provision; the existence of clear indicators of the
            surcharge's performance in stimulating demand. This
            field note concludes with valuable lessons from Burkina
            Faso's experience for other countries.
