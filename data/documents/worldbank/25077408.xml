THE BUSINESS CASE&#13;
Leadership support and endorsement are critical to fos-&#13;
tering gender diversity and equality in an organization,&#13;
which impacts the bottom line. Leaders have the power to&#13;
influence key decisions, ensure that gender smart policies&#13;
are implemented throughout the organization, hold staff&#13;
accountable, and pave the way for addressing corporate&#13;
gender gaps in attracting and retaining the best talent.&#13;
Leaders can also lead by example internally and externally&#13;
and build partnerships. The UN WEPs, for example, seek&#13;
to build on leaders as change agents and encourage CEOs  Photo 1 -Zulekha ospitals senior management celebrated ther SheWorks membership&#13;

            Putting gender smart commitments into
            practice : SheWorks year one progress report
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This short report marks the one year
            anniversary of World Bank Group's IFC-led SheWorks
            global private sector partnership to advance women's
            employment opportunities and improve working conditions for
            more than 360,000 women by 2016. Launched by WBG President
            Jim Yong Kim at the 2014 Clinton Global Initiative Annual
            Meetings, this partnership brings together 13 leading
            private sector companies that have made a minimum of three
            gender smart commitments to support women as employees in
            their respective workplaces. Commitments include, amongst
            others, implementing sponsorship/mentorship programs to
            advance women in leadership, providing flexible work
            arrangements, and establishing effective anti-sexual
            harassment mechanisms. The purpose of this progress report
            is to capture, on an aggregate level, the progress made by
            SheWorks member companies towards realizing their
            commitments. The report starts with an overview of the
            SheWorks partnership, the various commitments made by
            members, and key partnership results and highlights. It then
            delves deeper into the progress members have made in each of
            the 6 commitment categories. The report ends with a
            forward-looking perspective on SheWorks and its plans for 2016.
