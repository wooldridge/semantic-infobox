STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
L SECrORAL BACKGROUND&#13;
Country Overview&#13;
1.1    Venezuela, situated on the north coast of South America and bordered by Colombia, Brazil&#13;
and Guyana, is the continent's sixth largest country with an estimated area of 916,442 km2 (see Maps).&#13;
In addition to its mainland, Venezuela possesses 72 islands and a maritime area of 362,000 km2 (the&#13;
country's declared exclusive economic zone). The total population is estimated at just under 21&#13;
million inhabitants (1993), some 83% of whom live in urban areas located mainly in the northern&#13;
states. Venezuela's per capita GDP of US$2,873 (1993) is the fifth highest in Latin America.&#13;
1.2   Although Venezuela lies entirely in the tropics, there is considerable variation in climate due&#13;
principally to differences in elevation and topographic effects. Average rainfall ranges from less than&#13;
500 mm on the north Caribbean coast to more than 4,000 mm in parts of the Orinoco Delta and the&#13;
eastern part of the Cordillera de M6rida. Humidity is generally high with average values exceeding&#13;
80% in the Amazon, the plains (llanos), and the Maracaibo lowlands. Annual average temperatures&#13;
range from 240 C at elevations below 800 m to 0° C at elevations over 3,000 m. The Orinoco river&#13;
system drains some 80% of the national territory.&#13;
Natural Resource Management and Protection&#13;
1.3   Biological Diversity. Venezuela is a sparsely populated country situated in the tropics and&#13;
enjoying a wide range of geographically-extensive habitats, many of which still remain little disturbed.&#13;
As a result, Venezuela has been identified as one of the world's most biologically diverse countries,&#13;
and has been classified by the World Wildlife Fund for Nature as one of Latin America's six&#13;
megadiversity countries. Estimates of the country's flora exceed 21,000 species of high vascular&#13;
plants, 5,000 of which are judged to be endemic to Venezuela. Other indicators include some 1,300&#13;
species of birds out of a world total of 9,000, 40% of 3,300 known species of neo-tropical birds and&#13;
more than 300 species of mammals, 18 of which are classified as endangered.&#13;
1.4   Protected Areas. To manage its biodiversity wealth and to protect its natural resources, over&#13;
the past 50 years Venezuela has put a significant part of its territory under different forms of&#13;
protection. At the core of the protected areas system are the country's 43 national parks, 21 natural&#13;
monuments and 10 wildlife refuges and reserves (Annex 1). Today Venezuela's national parks and&#13;
monuments encompass more than 14 million ha, or 15% of the national territory (compared with a&#13;
world average of 5%). In addition to preserving much of the country's biological resources for future&#13;
generations, Venezuela's protected areas provide considerable economic and social benefits in terms&#13;
of protection of critical watersheds, water supply, electricity production, and eco-tourism. The&#13;
national parks are the natural catchment areas supplying about 30% of the water supply to major&#13;
towns, and almost 30% of the water utilized by all the hydroelectric dams of the country.&#13;
1.5   Legislative Framework. Venezuela has developed an impressive body of environmental&#13;
legislation and a fairly comprehensive environmental management system. Fundamental laws for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
environmental protection relate to: (a) medium- and long-term environmental goals; (b)&#13;
administration and policy implementation; and (c) law enforcement. The medium- and long-term&#13;
environmental goals are set forth in the Organic Law on the Environment (Ley Orginica del&#13;
Ambiente - LOA) and the Organic Zoning Law (Ley Orginica para la Ordenaci6n del Territorio -&#13;
LOOT). The LOA, passed in 1976, provides Venezuela's general environmental policy framework.&#13;
In 1983, the Government enacted the LOOT, mandating extensive land zoning and planning at the&#13;
national, regional and local levels. Policy implementation and management of the environment are&#13;
addressed in the 1976 Organic Law on Central Administration (Ley Orginica de la Administracifn&#13;
Central, which created the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARNR) and conferred&#13;
on it broad authority to issue regulations in pursuit of its mandate. The 1988 Organic Law of&#13;
Municipal Regime (Ley Org6nica del Regimen Municipal) defines the environmental competence of&#13;
the municipalities, and the 1989 Organic Law on Decentralization (Ley OrgAnica de Decentralizaci6n)&#13;
promotes the transfer of authority and responsibilities from the national level to the state and local&#13;
levels. A new and stringent Environmental Penal Law (Ley Penal del Ambiente) was enacted in&#13;
April 1992.&#13;
1.6   Institutional Settinig. MARNR, with headquarters in Caracas and delegations in each state,&#13;
is responsible for the enforcement of environmental standards and the preparation of most&#13;
environmental and land planning at the national and regional levels. MARNR is also responsible for&#13;
management of much of the publicly owned natural resources, including inland waters, forests and&#13;
protected areas. MARNR operates through several autonomous institutes and services which enjoy&#13;
greater management freedom than do the line Ministries. The Instituto Aut6nomo Nacional de&#13;
Parques (National Park Service, INPARQUES) which manages the national parks, natural&#13;
monuments and urban parks is one of the more important autonomous institutes linked to MARNR.&#13;
Two other relevant autonomous services are PROFAUNA, in charge of wildlife protection, and&#13;
SADA-AMAZONAS, which focusses on the environmental protection of Venezuela's sparsely&#13;
occupied State of Amazonas.&#13;
1.7   INPARQUES was created in 1978 to administer national parks, natural monuments and&#13;
urban/recreational parks. By regional Latin American standards, INPARQUES is a relatively&#13;
successful protected areas management agency. Most of the parks and wildlands for which&#13;
INPARQUES is responsible are not "paper parks", but rather have at least some basic infrastructure&#13;
and on-site management activities. INPARQUES also has a sizeable cadre of highly motivated&#13;
personnel. Nonetheless, Venezuela's national park system has expanded rapidly over the last few&#13;
decades, and the large number of newly created parks has strained the ability of INPARQUES to&#13;
fulfill its legally-mandated management responsibilities, partly because of its present fairly centralized&#13;
structure and staffing/skills mix pattern, exacerbated by budgetary constraints associated with declines&#13;
in domestic oil revenues. Hence, it is clear that the rapid expansion of Venezuela's system of&#13;
protected areas now needs to be followed by a period of consolidation and more effective&#13;
management of these areas, with significant emphasis on the institutional strengthening of&#13;
INPARQUES and some of the other key agencies mentioned below.&#13;
1.8   PROFAUNA was created in 1989 to manage the country's wildlife, particularly ten wildlife&#13;
refuges and reserves. SADA-AMAZONAS was also created in 1989 to coordinate, plan and execute&#13;
the environmental policy for the Amazon territory. The Alejandro de Humboldt Amazonian Center&#13;
for Environmental Research (CAIAH), attached to SADA-AMAZONAS, is the focal point for&#13;
coordinating and implementing all research activities in that part of the Amazon basin which lies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
within Venezuela. Many other Venezuelan institutions also perform activities which concern the&#13;
environment. The Ministry of Coordination and Planning Office (CORDIPLAN) has a major say&#13;
in coordinating environmental issues of national scale. Although heavily concentrated at the national&#13;
level, environmental management is beginning to be decentralized to state and local authorities, in&#13;
accordance with the new decentralization law (para.2.14). Also of interest is the involvement of the&#13;
Ministry of Defense in activities of environmental police and law enforcement. The Fuerzas Armadas&#13;
de Cooperaci6n (FAC) are the military corps devoted to surveillance and protection activities&#13;
(frontier control, customs, public properties pro-xtion, etc.). Since 1952, they have also been&#13;
responsible for enforcing environmental policy on the ground. Certain units of the National Guard&#13;
are seconded to MARNR, and consequently to INPARQUES, to assist in inspection and control.&#13;
FAC presently maintains fixed warden/inspection posts in five national parks (Henri Pittier, El Avila,&#13;
El Tama, Canaima and Marfa Lionza).&#13;
1.9   There are several strong (both in terms of organization and professional staff) Venezuelan&#13;
NGOs which have been acting for many years on problems relating to environmental conservation.&#13;
Specifically, they have been working in applied research, in environmental education, in helping to&#13;
channel private sector resources to environmental causes, and in the actual implementation of&#13;
conservation and natural resource management projects. Both national and international NGOs, such&#13;
as The Nature Conservancy (TNC) have also already been working with the Government in the&#13;
preparation of studies and management plans for protected areas and environmental education&#13;
programs.&#13;
1.10   Sectoral Issues. A Bank Environmental Issues Paper for Venezuela (IBRD Report No. 8272-&#13;
VE, issued in December 1991) documents in detail Venezuela's environmental achievements.&#13;
However, the report also points out that the weakest point in Venezuela's environmental system is&#13;
its limited capacity to enforce environmental standards and to manage its natural resources on a&#13;
sustainable basis. More specifically the paper points to:&#13;
(a)   The need to integrate environmental objectives more systematically into economic&#13;
decision making.&#13;
(b)   The need to reduce deforestation and illegal mining and to control industrial and&#13;
urban water pollution, through better monitoring and surveillance, enforcement of&#13;
existing regulations, new price mechanisms and investment in pollution control&#13;
technologies.&#13;
(c)   The need to improve management of the country's protected areas. On the latter&#13;
point, the paper states that "[t]he principal threat to Venezuela's vast biological&#13;
diversity is poor on-the-ground management of its most important protected areas....&#13;
As a result, many have been subject to slash-and-burn agriculture, deforestation for&#13;
pasture or extensive illegal hunting and fishing." To cope with this situation,&#13;
infrastructure and equipment are in short supply, and research to guide sustainable&#13;
development management is lacking, as are resources for educating park users and for&#13;
working with local communities. Given budgetary constraints which the Government&#13;
faces, the report concludes that if Venezuela is to sustain its national park system and&#13;
build upon its past accomplishments, technical and financial support for its efforts to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
conserve its natural heritage will need to be increased at both the national and&#13;
international levels.&#13;
1.11   Venezuela has demonstrated a strong history of concern for conservation issues. It possesses&#13;
a comprehensive body of sound environmental legislation and the basic institutional framework for&#13;
protected areas management, particularly with regard to its national parks system. Further, it does&#13;
not appear to have any serious policy or pricing distortions in place which would threaten the&#13;
sustainability of that system. In this context, the focus of efforts to improve natural resource&#13;
protection over the medium-term should be on strengthening the national capacity to implement&#13;
existing legislation, regulations and environmental programs.&#13;
Experience with Previous Bank Lending&#13;
1.12   Between 1961 and 1992, the Bank approved 23 loans to Venezuela, totalling US$2,425.2&#13;
million. These included support for agricultural development (three projects), transport (four projects,&#13;
including an airport loan), power (four projects, including part of the Guri hydroelectric project),&#13;
telecommunications (two projects), water supply and urban development (two projects), education&#13;
and social development (two projects), debt and debt service reduction (one loan), and support for&#13;
structural adjustment and related policy reform efforts (four projects) and technical assistance (one&#13;
project). Most projects have been viewed as relatively successful. During 1993-95 six additional loans&#13;
were approved in institutional development, education, agricultural extension, health (two projects)&#13;
and transport (two project). The National Parks Project, a predecessor to this project, was approved&#13;
in December 1992, but was subsequently withdrawn in June 1994 following the failure of the&#13;
government to secure authorization for Loan signing within the 18 month deadline established by&#13;
Bank policy.&#13;
Lessons Learned from Similar Projects&#13;
1.13   While many Bank-financed projects include environmental components, loans primarily in&#13;
support of environmental objectives are still small in number. In fiscal years 1989-92 there were 26&#13;
operations approved totalling US$1.4 billion dealing with natural resources and the environment,&#13;
several of them  including the management of parks and other protected areas.  Nine new&#13;
commitments were made in 1993 (The World Bank and the Environment. A Progress Report. 1993l.&#13;
In reviewing these efforts, as well as experiences with park management in industrialized countries,&#13;
the Bank has drawn several lessons which have been duly considered in the design of the proposed&#13;
project, among them:&#13;
(a)   Management Strengthening. The effective implementation of a national parks system&#13;
requires significant on-the-ground management. Management objectives have to be&#13;
translated into specific measures with a budget for implementing them. These&#13;
measures usually include the training of personnel, the provision of infrastructure and&#13;
equipment, and the development of scientifically sound management options.&#13;
(b)   Local Community Participation.   Early and sustained involvement of local&#13;
communities and environmental NGOs is critical for several reasons: (i) to gain the&#13;
support of the public for environmental conservation; (ii) to properly include sound&#13;
demands of the local population in the parks' management plans; and (iii) to enlist&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
the community and the private sector in sharing the costs of the conservation&#13;
programs.&#13;
(c)   Decentralization of Management and Technical Decisions. Over-centralization of&#13;
decision making at national parks headquarters results in poor management at the&#13;
field level and low capacity to react to environmental and social change.&#13;
Decentralization (empowering local officers and communities) seems to be an&#13;
effective way to increase management efficiency and community participation.&#13;
(d)   Increasing Revenues. Although national parks and other protected areas are the&#13;
source of important economic benefits for society, the national park administrations&#13;
normally capture few of these. Increasing the revenues collected from the public&#13;
could enhance national park administrations in many ways: (i) operational costs could&#13;
be partially isolated from national budget fluctuations; (ii) the demand for, and the&#13;
benefits of, the national parks system would become more visible; (iii) a more&#13;
equitable sharing of costs could be developed, including charges to off-site consumers.&#13;
1.14   These lessons have been taken into account in the design of the proposed project, which aims&#13;
to consolidate the existing network of national parks through better management. The bulk of the&#13;
project investment would be made at the local level. Specific decentralization goals and means to&#13;
achieve them are also part of the project. INPARQUES already conducts consultation workshops&#13;
with local communities before major management decisions are taken. These activities, together with&#13;
extensive NGOs involvement, would be encouraged by the project. Efforts to increase revenue&#13;
collection to sustain park operations would also be an important feature of the project, and&#13;
INPARQUES has already taken important steps in this direction. In 1994 the revenues generated&#13;
by INPARQUES reached 20% of its current costs (para. 2.38, 2.39, Annex 5).&#13;

IL THE PROJECI&#13;
Origin&#13;
2.1   In the course of reviewing the Bank's draft Environmental Issues Paper for Venezuela (para.&#13;
1.10), discussions were held with the Government on a possible project to help strengthen the&#13;
management of its protected areas. Priority was given to national parks and wildlife refuges, because&#13;
of their importance in both ecological and economic terms. An identification mission visited&#13;
Venezuela in early December 1991. The general scope of the project was defined, and INPARQUES&#13;
appointed a technical team to prepare the project in consultation with other potential participant&#13;
agencies and NGOs. Subsequent preparation missions were conducted and a National Parks&#13;
Management Project was appraised during June/July 1992. Loan negotiations for this project took&#13;
place in mid-October 1992 and the project was approved in December 1992 as Loan 3535-VE.&#13;
2.2   In accordance with Bank practice, the Loan for the National Parks Management Project was&#13;
withdrawn in June 1994, when 18 months elapsed following Board approval without the Loan being&#13;
signed. The reasons for the delays in securing the necessary authorizations from Government for&#13;
Loan signing were due in large part to the volatile political situation during the period. However,&#13;
although the fate of the Loan for the original project was uncertain, throughout 1993 and 1994&#13;
INPARQUES continued to carry out project activities on a limited basis using its own budgetary&#13;
resources (see para. 2.30 on retroactive financing).&#13;
2.3   Following a request from Government to revive the project in late 1994, and actions taken&#13;
by both the executive and legislative branches to establish their commitment to the project and to&#13;
avoid the previous problems, the project was re-appraised in January-February 1995 and renamed (in&#13;
English) the Venezuela Inparques Project, to distinguish it formally from the withdrawn Loan.&#13;
Objectives and Summary Description&#13;
2.4   The project would strengthen the capability of Government to manage Venezuela's national&#13;
and urban parks, natural monuments, and wildlife refuges and reserves. In particular, the project&#13;
would (a) strengthen conservation and protection of vulnerable areas; (b) intensify public&#13;
environmental research, training and education efforts; and (c) improve the economic sustainability&#13;
of the national parks and other protected areas.&#13;
2.5   The main project components are:&#13;
(a)   Management and protection of 16 national parks in northern Venezuela, four national&#13;
parks and two groups of natural monuments in the Amazon region, two wildlife&#13;
refuges and seven urban recreational parks; and establishment of an effective fire&#13;
prevention and fire fighting capacity throughout the national park system.&#13;
(b)   Applied environmental research, to support sustainable management of various parks,&#13;
generate useful scientific knowledge on the ecology of the parks, and assist Venezuela&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
in safeguarding its rights with respect to research findings and the possible commercial&#13;
use of its biodiversity resources.&#13;
(c)   Environmental education, both at the regional and local levels, to disseminate&#13;
information, raise the level of knowledge about environmental issues and their&#13;
linkages with economic development, and engage the active participation of the&#13;
community in supporting environmental protection.&#13;
(d)   Institutional development including training, technical assistance and studies; physical&#13;
infrastructure, equipment, furniture and other operational support for institutions&#13;
engaged in the implementation of the project.&#13;
2.6   In designing the project, due attention has been paid to the selection of specific parks,&#13;
monuments and refuges; and to institutional capacities of the agencies involved and their required&#13;
strengthening. Selection of national parks has been based on: (a) recent INPARQUES and&#13;
international NGO studies on the severity of human impacts on national park sustainability --&#13;
exemplified by several highly affected coastal parks; (b) identification of major gaps on information&#13;
and resources for effective park management - exemplified by several Amazonian parks; and (c)&#13;
ecological breadth of the selected parks -- ten of the country's 15 ecological sub-regions are&#13;
represented in the protected areas proposed for inclusion in the project. As for the institutional&#13;
capacity of the leading executing agencies, INPARQUES is the Venezuela institution responsible for&#13;
the conservation of natural resources in national parks, and is also principally responsible for the&#13;
management of many of the country's urban recreational parks. Its experience, accumulated over&#13;
many years of activity, is quite good. Nevertheless there is a need for streamlining, decentralizing and&#13;
strengthening various INPARQUES administrative, financial and technical functions and procedures,&#13;
and this will be supported by the project.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.7   The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Venezuela, dated October 13, 1993, and discussed&#13;
at the Board on November 4, 1993, is to support increased efficiency and decentralization of public&#13;
services, private sector development, poverty alleviation, and environmental protection. The proposed&#13;
project is consistent with this strategy and would address primarily environmental protection and also&#13;
increase the efficiency of and decentralize INPARQUES, while contracting many of the&#13;
INPARQUES activities to the private and NGO sectors:&#13;
(a)   The project would improve public sector performance by helping the Government to&#13;
implement an already existing and well-designed body of policies, legislation and&#13;
regulations concerning environmental conservation of an important part of&#13;
Venezuela's natural resource base.&#13;
(b)   It would result in significant environmental gains through biodiversity preservation and&#13;
sustainable management and protection of valuable natural resources. Important&#13;
economic benefits could also be generated, since many of Venezuela's national parks&#13;
protect natural resources of high economic value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
(c)   It would encourage private sector involvement and active NGO participation in&#13;
project implementation, and subsequently in helping to ensure the economic&#13;
sustainability of the national park system.&#13;
(d)   The project would support decentralization of national parks management and the&#13;
greater involvement of local communities. These actions would have a modest, but&#13;
positive, impact on the well-being of poor populations living in the vicinity of national&#13;
parks (new livelihood opportunities, technical support for sustainable resource use&#13;
and better environmental infrastructure).&#13;
2.8   Program Objective Categories. As described in detail below, most project activities and&#13;
benefits are related to environmental management and protection, and therefore the project is&#13;
designated as belonging to the Program Objective Category of Environmentally Sustainable&#13;
Development.&#13;
Detiled Description&#13;
2.9   Parks Management and Protection (US$73.7 million; 77% of total costs):&#13;
(a)   Improvement of the administration and management of 20 national parks and two&#13;
groups of natural monuments through the provision of basic infrastructure,&#13;
equipment, and personnel. A list of the selected parks, and other component details,&#13;
is provided in Annex 1. The project would support: (i) administration (offices,&#13;
residential facilities in isolated parks, maintenance warehouses, etc.); (ii) park&#13;
protection (boundary demarcation, access controls, guard posts, etc.); (iii)&#13;
environmental education and interpretation (visitor and information centers,&#13;
interpretative trails and signs, observation towers, etc.); and (iv) tourism and&#13;
recreation (recreational area development, access road rehabilitation, kiosks, etc.).&#13;
Equipment needs consist primarily of transport (trucks, motorcycles, and boats) as&#13;
well as office and field equipment. Personnel costs include incremental staff to&#13;
strengthen INPARQUES protection, resources management, and administrative&#13;
activities at the field level.&#13;
Four of the national parks and the two natural monuments would be in the state of&#13;
Amazonas, with emphasis on protective activities. Specific activities would include:&#13;
(i) financing a minimum number of inspection and control posts in strategic areas&#13;
(airstrips, river confluence, etc.), equipped principally with radio equipment and boats;&#13;
(ii) strengthening the regional office to support these posts; (iii) staffing of ranger and&#13;
park guards and supporting office and living equipment; and (iv) support for an aerial&#13;
surveillance and logistics program. A strong environmental research program is also&#13;
envisaged, to help develop management plans and improve basic knowledge of these&#13;
parks (paras. 2.10, 2.12). The research component in the state of Amazonas would&#13;
be coordinated with SADA-AMAZONAS.&#13;
(b)   Improvement of infrastructure and equipment in two PROFAUNA wildlife refuRees&#13;
(Cuare and Tortuga Arrau'. These two refuges were selected for their importance&#13;
as conservation areas and for their proximity to two national parks included in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
project (Morrocoy and Cinaruco-Capanaparo, respectively). Specific activities to be&#13;
financed include: (i) infrastructure in support of administrative, management, and&#13;
educational activities; (ii) equipment for administrative, research, and field operations;&#13;
and (iii) incremental staffing for management and educational activities. Each of the&#13;
two refuge-national park complexes would be managed as integral protected area&#13;
units facilitating the coordination of public information, environmental education,&#13;
management, and research activities.&#13;
(c)    Strengthening of the administration and management of seven urban recreational&#13;
parks located in the country's largest metropolitan areas. These parks are large green&#13;
areas of about 10 to 80 hectares each; they were selected for their proximity to&#13;
national parks and because they receive a large number of visitors annually, which&#13;
enables them to play an important role in reinforcing environmental education efforts.&#13;
Limited investments would consist of: (i) engineering studies and the development&#13;
and restoration of basic park infrastructure and selected attractions; (ii) the&#13;
construction and equipping of visitor and information centers in support of the&#13;
project's environmental education component (para. 2.12); (iii) equipment for&#13;
education and recreational activities; and (iv) additional personnel for administrative,&#13;
security, educational and recreational activities. Educational activities would be&#13;
coordinated with similar efforts planned in the adjacent national parks.&#13;
(d)    Expansion of INPARQUES fire prevention and control capacity. Fire is probably the&#13;
most serious threat to natural resource conservation in Venezuela. However, at&#13;
present, INPARQUES has only one fire prevention and control base camp located&#13;
in El Avila national park. The project would support the establishment of an&#13;
additional nine principal and 8 auxiliary camps which would extend protection to 28&#13;
of the country's most fire-prone areas (Annex 1). This sub-component would include:&#13;
(i) administrative offices, residential quarters, and garage and storage facilities in each&#13;
of the nine principal and 8 auxiliary camps; (ii) equipment for fire prevention and&#13;
control and rescue operations; (iii) vehicles for fire combat; and (iv) incremental&#13;
staffing. A critical factor in reducing the risk of park fires is the development and&#13;
implementation of an effective public education campaign directed at reducing the&#13;
human causes of forest fires. This need would be addressed under the project's&#13;
environmental education component (para. 2.12).&#13;
2.10   Environmental Research (US$7.9 million; 8% of total costs). Worldwide the emphasis on&#13;
research for national parks management has been growing fast over the last twenty years, as park&#13;
management goals have shifted from simple control of trespassers to more active resource&#13;
management, with a view to long-term sustainability. Also, the need to cope with increasing pressures&#13;
from conflicting demands -- tourism, local community concerns, biodiversity protection, national&#13;
development needs -- requires more and better problem-oriented research. Another area needing&#13;
more information and analysis concerns the economic valuation of protected areas benefits and of&#13;
protected areas policies.&#13;
2.11   To increase the availability of information required for sustainable park management the&#13;
project would finance data acquisition and research programs -- to be contracted out -- plus a limited&#13;
acquisition of infrastructure, equipment and materials needed either to make use of the research&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
outcomes or to support research activities inside the parks. The focus will be in applied research&#13;
and special efforts will be devoted to assure the timely dissemination and actual use of the research&#13;
outcomes. The component is presented in more detail in Annex 2 and the background documents&#13;
therein mentioned, and would include the following:&#13;
(a)   The acquisition and systematization of baseline information on national park&#13;
environments, including: (i) establishment of a data base of currently available&#13;
information on national parks; (ii) Rapid Ecological and Social Assessments in 10&#13;
national parks; (iii) production of thematic maps and geographic data bases (e.g.,&#13;
vegetation cover, land use hydrology and related variables) for eight national parks.&#13;
(b)   Basic studies leading to the preparation of management plans for two national parks&#13;
and two groups of national monuments in the State of Amazonas.&#13;
(c)    Monitoring of physical and biological processes, including water quality studies, in five&#13;
coastal and marine national parks and wildlife population studies and management&#13;
programs in two wildlife refuges and adjacent national parks.&#13;
(d)   Financing of studies to address (i) environmental problems in national parks&#13;
management, such as the impact of tourism and slash and burn agriculture; (ii) issues&#13;
related to livelihood of local communities living inside or around parks and their&#13;
impact on the park; (iii) the local and international value of the environmental&#13;
services provided by parks and protected areas, which are necessary to justify the&#13;
allocation of scarce fiscal resources to parks protection; and (iv) policy instruments&#13;
for capturing the economic value of protected areas and for generating revenues to&#13;
finance parks management.&#13;
(e)   The establishment of five stations which would support the research activities of&#13;
INPARQUES and PROFAUNA, and would also be used by universities and NGOs.&#13;
(f)    A consultant specialized in research on biodiversity protection would be retained&#13;
under the institutional development component to help orient the INPARQUES&#13;
research program and offer advice in ways to better incorporate research outcomes&#13;
into current park management.&#13;
2.12   Environmental Education (US$ 3.6 million, 4% of total costs). Based on the past experience&#13;
of INPARQUES in environmental education, the project would support the expansion and&#13;
establishment of present and new educational activities in a number of urban recreational parks,&#13;
national parks and wildlife refuges.  The program  would strengthen the INPARQUES&#13;
decentralization program, with the reach and depth of environmental education activities being greatly&#13;
increased by training volunteers as multiplying agents. This would also increase the involvement of&#13;
local community groups, NGOs and educational associations. The programs are designed to reach&#13;
the entire spectrum of park users, namely: local communities within and around national parks,&#13;
school-age children and their families, volunteer groups and park visitors, and the broader society at&#13;
large in Venezuela. If successful, this public educational effort should lead to noticeable changes in&#13;
public perceptions and behavior, in support of natural resource conservation. Specific project&#13;
activities are presented in Annex 3; financing would be provided for educational and planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
equipment for the INPARQUES central office, visitors centers and information centers; training&#13;
costs; and incremental staffing costs. A consultant specialized in community environmental education&#13;
and extension would be retained under the institutional development component to help orient and&#13;
evaluate the INPARQUES educational program.&#13;
2.13  Institutional Development (US$10.8 million; 11% of total costs). The project would support&#13;
the project administration activities and institutional strengthening of INPARQUES. This would&#13;
include assistance for a major decentralization of the INPARQUES administrative and technical&#13;
functions from its central headquarters to the regional, state and park levels; strengthening of&#13;
INPARQUES in-house training capacity and increasing the availability of trained manpower for&#13;
implementing project activities; and provision of essential technical assistance. The specific activities&#13;
which would be financed are detailed in Annex 4. These would include support for:&#13;
(a)   Office equipment, infrastructure and other facilities required to support the&#13;
INPARQUES decentralization and administrative reform process.&#13;
(b)   Rehabilitation of the Rancho Grande training center to serve as a training forum for&#13;
INPARQUES personnel, and the training of personnel at all grades and levels.&#13;
(c)   Technical assistance to assist in the INPARQUES decentralization process and the&#13;
establishment of modem and more efficient management and control systems;&#13;
environmental research; public environmental education and promotion of community&#13;
participation in park management; ad hoc management studies, including cost&#13;
recovery options for national parks, and development of management, administrative&#13;
and financial procedures (e.g., bidding, contracting, disbursement, accounting, auditing&#13;
and personnel management); and additional studies in natural resource issues,&#13;
including possible future project preparation work, that may be agreed with the Bank&#13;
(see Annex 4, Table 5 for list of project studies and technical assistance).&#13;
(d)   Office equipment, salaries, travel, technical assistance and other expenditures related&#13;
to the Project Coordinating Unit.&#13;
2.14  INPARQUES is a well-regarded protected areas management agency, with a sizeable cadre&#13;
of highly motivated personnel at both the technical and administrative levels. Nonetheless, various&#13;
institutional weaknesses reduce the overall effectiveness of INPARQUES. For the most part, these&#13;
relate to an over-centralization of administrative and technical support functions, and staffing, in&#13;
Caracas (62% of total administrative and technical staff are based in or near Caracas), which results&#13;
in an inefficient response to the needs of the more distant national parks. At the same time, many&#13;
of the INPARQUES regional and state offices and field units still do not possess the critical mass&#13;
of staff, infrastructure, equipment and training needed to discharge their functions properly. To&#13;
address these issues, INPARQUES has started carrying out a Decentralization and Administrative&#13;
Reform Plan, which the project would help to implement (paras.3.2(a), 2.21(a), 3.1(a)). An assurance&#13;
was obtained during negotiations that the INPARQUES Decentralization and Administrative Reform&#13;
Plan would be implemented in a satisfactory manner. The Plan's main elements include a realignment&#13;
of the institutional chain of command and structure; a shifting to the regional offices of many special&#13;
programs (e.g., El Avila, Los Roques, Guatopo) and other functions currently carried out by the&#13;
INPARQUES central office; strengthening of the capacity of a much leaner and more efficient&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
central office to supervise and coordinate planning, policy, administrative procedures and technical&#13;
support; reform of the INPARQUES recruitment, training and incentives policies to professionalize&#13;
and upgrade staff at all levels; and essential investments in training, infrastructure and equipment, and&#13;
expansion of staff (particularly at park level, and largely through redeployment) to implement these&#13;
changes. Examples of the kinds of functions to be decentralized include: (a) selection and contracting&#13;
of personnel; (b) bidding and contracting for purchase of equipment, materials and works up to&#13;
specified levels; and (c) cooperative agreements with municipalities and other local groups, and&#13;
concessions (e.g., for tourism or recreational purposes) which do not commit land and buildings for&#13;
the long term.&#13;
2.15   As detailed in Annex 4, most of the activities under the project training and technical&#13;
assistance components have been designed to support implementation of the Decentralization and&#13;
Administrative Reform  Plan.  The Plan of Decentralization  and Administrative Reform  of&#13;
INPARQUES was approved by CORDIPLAN on January 3, 1994. For implementation the Central&#13;
Personnel Office needs to authorize the new staff positions in the personnel structure.&#13;
INPARQUES has taken definite steps in implementing the Plan including the establishment of the&#13;
National Capital Region, the Falcon-Zulia Region and the Amazonas Region, which were created&#13;
by the President of INPARQUES on October 31, 1993, on October 31, 1993 and on November 8&#13;
respectively. In addition, on October 21, 1993, INPARQUES transferred 11 of the 13 special&#13;
programs existing in 1992 to the National Capital Regional Office.Y An assurance was obtained&#13;
during negotiations that INPARQUES would implement the remainder of the Decentralization and&#13;
Administrative Reform Plan in a satisfactory manner over the life of the project including timing,&#13;
functions by type of administrative units and staffing. Specific indicators are shown in Annex 7.&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
2.16   Project Agencies. The principal implementing agency for the project would be INPARQUES.&#13;
However, for some project components (wildlife refuges, Amazonian parks and law enforcement),&#13;
INPARQUES would cooperate with other public environmental agencies (PROFAUNA, SADA-&#13;
AMAZONAS and FAC, respectively). The arrangements for coordination among the implementing&#13;
agencies participating in the project are described in three Participation Agreements (Convenios)&#13;
between INPARQUES and each of the other agencies, dated December 10, 1993. The Participation&#13;
Agreements between INPARQUES and SADA-AMAZONAS and PROFAUNA, respectively,&#13;
require revision. Drafts of the revised Participation Agreements have been prepared and a condition&#13;
of disbursements for activities relevant to SADA-AMAZONAS and PROFAUNA would be execution&#13;
of the revised Participation Agreements (para.3.3). An assurance was obtained during negotiations&#13;
that the Participation Agreements between INPARQUES and PROFAUNA, SADA-AMAZONAS&#13;
and FAC, respectively, would be executed in a satisfactory manner (para.3.2(b)).&#13;
1/     Special Programs are programs that, due to special characteristics, such as seriousness of the problems, public impact or others,&#13;
are managed by the Central INPARQUES Office rather than by the Regional Offices. The Special Programs existing at the time of Board&#13;
approval of the National Parks Management Project in December 1992 included the National Parks El Avila, Guatopo, Laguna de&#13;
Tacarigua and Los Roques, the Recreational Parks el Este and the Parque Zoologico Caricuao, and seven fire fighting and control&#13;
programs. All of these were moved to the National Capital Regional Office on October 21, 1993, except the Los Roques National Park&#13;
and fire fighting related activities. The Special Program for Los Roques is in the process of moving to the National Capital Region and&#13;
this process is expected to be completed by December 31, 1995. The remaining Special Program, which involves search, rescue and life&#13;
saving activities, covers the entire territory of Venezuela and requires coordination with the National Guard and other agencies, and will&#13;
thus continue to managed by the Central Office of INPARQUES.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.17  The President of INPARQUES would be responsible for overall project administration and&#13;
policy direction. He would consult on overall policy aspects with the existing Governing Board (Junta&#13;
Directiva) which includes representatives of the private sector, NGOs, trade unions, universities and&#13;
the oil industry. The President would be assisted on a day-to-day basis by the Project Coordination&#13;
Unit (PCU), which was established on November 8, 1993 (para. 3.1(d)), and which would be&#13;
responsible for planning and coordinating technical activities and for monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
project results. The PCU would be managed by a coordinator, an administrative assistant and a&#13;
secretary, to be hired by the project. The PCU would include INPARQUES high level staff working&#13;
in the areas of administration, infrastructure, research and environmental education, which would&#13;
advise, plan, monitor and supervise the activities of the project. Staff from the technical divisions of&#13;
INPARQUES would support project supervision and would maintain close contact with regional, state&#13;
and field office personnel. Financial control would be the responsibility of the PCU with the support&#13;
of the General Directorate of Administration and Services within INPARQUES, both at the central&#13;
and regional levels.&#13;
2.18   Annual Work Programs. Each year, comprehensive annual plans and budgets would be used&#13;
to monitor project implementation and progress towards meeting agreed targets and objectives.&#13;
These plans and budgets would be drafted by the PCU and submitted to the President and Governing&#13;
Board of INPARQUES for approval. An assurance was obtained during negotiations that adequate&#13;
counterpart funds would be made available to the project in a timely manner (para.3.2(i)). An&#13;
assurance was also obtained during negotiations that (a) by March 31 of each year of the project, the&#13;
draft annual operating plan and budget proposal for the next project year would be made available&#13;
to the Bank for review and comments; (b) a formal joint annual review by the Bank and the&#13;
Borrower would be held no later than May 31 each year to focus on the status of project&#13;
implementation, the proposed annual operating plan, and any changes in project design or&#13;
implementation that may be necessary; and (c) the Bank would receive a copy of the final annual&#13;
plan and budget when they are approved (para.3.2(c)).&#13;
2.19   Monitoring. Reporting and Supervision. INPARQUES would regularly collect and analyze&#13;
data on key indicators to monitor progress in physical execution and assess project impact, comparing&#13;
the results with the pre-project estimates. INPARQUES would prepare and send to the Bank&#13;
quarterly progress reports, and copies of the studies carried out during project implementation. The&#13;
quarterly reports would both describe progress in project execution, and identify possible&#13;
implementation issues and propose appropriate solutions. The format for quarterly reports, project&#13;
implementation and impact indicators, and the implementation schedule are in Annex 7. Some of&#13;
the project impact indicators will be quantified as a result of a baseline study to be carried out during&#13;
1995; TOR for the study are in Annex 4, Attachment 4. The Bank would supervise the project&#13;
regularly, and each year INPARQUES would invite an Independent Evaluation Committee to&#13;
monitor and evaluate project implementation progress. The composition of the Committee would&#13;
include, inter aia, representatives of relevant NGOs (para 3.1(c)). INPARQUES would make the&#13;
findings of the Committee available to the Bank by March 31 of each year. An assurance was&#13;
obtained during negotiations that: (a) the Bank would receive copies of quarterly project progress&#13;
reports within 30 days of the end of the quarter (para.3.2(e)); and, (b) the findings of the annual&#13;
Independent Evaluation Committee would be made available to the Bank for review by March 31&#13;
of each year, beginning in 1996 (para.3.2(d)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
2.20   Accounts and audits.  INPARQUES would maintain separate accounts for project&#13;
expenditures. The 1995 project accounts would also include expenditures incurred prior to the&#13;
project eligible for retroactive financing. An assurance was obtained during negotiations that:&#13;
(a) these accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank; and&#13;
(b) the audit report of project accounts, including a separate opinion on Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOEs), and the audit report of the overall financial status of INPARQUES (balance sheet,&#13;
statements of income and expenses and related statements), and the financial statements themselves,&#13;
would be provided to the Bank through INPARQUES within six months of the end of each fiscal&#13;
year. The audit reports would convey the auditor's opinion and comments as necessary on the&#13;
methodology employed in the compilation of the statements of expenditures, their accuracy, the&#13;
relevance of supporting documents, eligibility for financing in terms of the project's legal agreements,&#13;
and standards of record keeping and internal controls related to the above (para.3.2(f)). The TOR&#13;
for the auditors should also include a specific analysis of compliance with procurement procedures,&#13;
especially when SOEs are involved.&#13;
Participation by NGOs and Local Communities&#13;
2.21   The project includes various important mechanisms for increasing participation by NGOs and&#13;
local communities in park management and related activities. Such participation is important because:&#13;
(i) some NGOs are well qualified to carry out certain tasks under contract to INPARQUES, thereby&#13;
reducing the direct burden of implementation on INPARQUES and facilitating efficient project&#13;
execution; (ii) NGOs and local communities can substantially increase the scope and effectiveness of&#13;
certain INPARQUES programs by contributing their labor, expertise and other assistance (as is&#13;
already the case in some of the parks); and (iii) local community and NGO participation in park&#13;
planning and management serve to increase support for (and minimize potential resistance to) park&#13;
protection programs. Both international and domestic NGOs, and local communities, were consulted&#13;
during the preparation and appraisal of the project and would be encouraged to participate actively&#13;
in the implementation stage as well, in the following ways:&#13;
(a)   With regard to national park management, new management plans (planes de&#13;
ordenamiento) require the review of local communities and other interested members&#13;
of the public, as mandated under existing Venezuelan law. INPARQUES would also&#13;
promote increased use of local volunteers for a variety of park protection,&#13;
management and fire prevention and control activities.&#13;
(b)   The environmental education component is designed to reach the entire spectrum of&#13;
park users -- local communities as well as all types of park visitors. The component&#13;
would rely heavily upon the use of local volunteers to increase the dissemination and&#13;
multiply the impact of environmental education activities.&#13;
(c)   The environmental research component would support baseline socioeconomic studies&#13;
of communities in the vicinity of 10 national parks where human pressures are&#13;
considered significant, so that this information can be incorporated into park&#13;
management planning.&#13;
(d)   The institutional strengthening component includes: (i) support for the INPARQUES&#13;
decentralization, which is expected to include the hiring of approximately nine new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
social scientists (one in the central office and one in each regional office), as well as&#13;
additional specialists in environmental education, community relations and outreach,&#13;
and liaison with local governments (at the regional, state and conservation unit levels);&#13;
and (ii) a technical assistance specialist to assist INPARQUES in community&#13;
extension and promotion of local participation among people living in and near&#13;
national parks.&#13;
(e)   Under the training sub-component, relevant courses for INPARQUES staff would&#13;
also be open to NGO representatives, private tourist guides, and local government&#13;
officials, to enhance their collaboration with INPARQUES park planning and&#13;
management efforts.&#13;
(f)   INPARQUES would organize regular public meetings at each of its regional or state&#13;
offices or in the protected areas under its administration with local community and&#13;
NGO representatives, inter alia, to: (i) review the progress of project implementation&#13;
(including the annual operating plans for each park) and discuss any suggested&#13;
changes; and (ii) consider options for increased participation by local communities and&#13;
NGOs in project implementation (e.g., as paid contractors, volunteer assistants, or&#13;
advocates for changing specific activities which impact on the parks).&#13;
Environmental Impact&#13;
2.22   The proposed project would have a positive environmental impact by directly enhancing the&#13;
management and protection of an area of approximately 110,000 km2, and by indirectly strengthening&#13;
the capacity to manage all of Venezuela's protected areas (some 0.5 millon km2, an area as large as&#13;
Spain) through training, education and institutional capacity building activities. No involuntary&#13;
resettlement is envisaged. Six of the national parks which would receive direct project support have&#13;
indigenous people living within their boundaries, but no adverse project-related interventions are&#13;
expected. This is because none of the planned investments in these parks would promote:&#13;
(i) increased access to indigenous areas by outsiders; (ii) significantly increased contact between&#13;
indigenous people and outsiders; or (iii) new restrictions on traditional resource use by indigenous&#13;
people. Interventions in the four Amazonian parks where larger indigenous communities are located&#13;
would be limited to research for the development of management plans and protective activities.&#13;
Support for two more accessible national parks (Canaima and Santos Luzardo) where smaller&#13;
indigenous groups are located would limit visitors to designated sections, and would aim generally to&#13;
reduce the pressure on critical conservation and indigenous sub-areas. Project-supported mechanisms&#13;
for local community participation in park planning and management would also apply in these six&#13;
parks.&#13;
Costs&#13;
2.23   Total project costs, including taxes, physical and price contingencies, are estimated at US$95.9&#13;
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$6.8 million, 7% of total costs (Annex 6, Tables&#13;
1 through 4). Base costs, estimated using February 1995 price levels, amount to US$89.1 million, and&#13;
do not include taxes because of the tax-exempt status of the implementing agency. Physical&#13;
contingencies of US$3.0 million, 3.4% of total base costs, have been estimated at 5% on all items&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
except technical assistance. Annual price contingencies have been calculated at a rate of 2.2% on&#13;
the base costs in U.S. dollars, and total US$4.9 million, 5.6% of total base costs.&#13;
Fmancing&#13;
2.24   The project would be financed by a Bank loan of US$55.0 million and a government&#13;
counterpart contribution of US$40.9 million (Annex 6, Table 5). The Bank Loan would be&#13;
equivalent to the full foreign exchange requirement and 54% of local costs. Local cost financing is&#13;
justified because of the strong environmental focus of the project. The Government would finance&#13;
all incremental operating costs, except those related to the Project Coordinating Unit. The Loan&#13;
would be made to the Republic of Venezuela and would be repayable over 15 years, including a five-&#13;
year grace period. Legislative approval giving Government authority to sign the Loan Agreement,&#13;
the lack of which caused the National Parks Management Project Loan to be withdrawn, has already&#13;
been obtained. In addition, prior to negotiations satisfactory evidence was received from Government&#13;
that provisions will be made for World Bank disbursement in 1995 (para. 3.1(f).&#13;
Procurement&#13;
2.25   A Country Procurement Assessment Report for Venezuela was issued in June 1990.&#13;
Subsequently, in August 1990, the Government issued a Procurement Law which expressly states that&#13;
all contracts for goods, works and services which will be totally or partially financed by international&#13;
organizations will be undertaken in accordance with the procurement procedures of such institutions.&#13;
INPARQUES has the capability to carry out procurement activities in an efficient manner and the&#13;
Director of the Project Coordinating Unit attended a Bank procurement seminar in January 1995,&#13;
and an appraisal mission received procurement documents (para 3.1(d)). The proposed procurement&#13;
arrangements for this project are summarized in the following table and an assurance was obtained&#13;
during negotiations that procurement arrangements during project implementation would be as&#13;
described below (para 3.2(g)).&#13;
2.26   Civil works include buildings, access roads and tracks, other minor infrastructure and&#13;
demarcation works, most of which are relatively small in size and are geographically dispersed among&#13;
over 30 parks and reserves. As the largest single contract is not expected to exceed US$1.5 million,&#13;
it is unlikely that foreign contractors would be interested. Accordingly, National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) procedures satisfactory to the Bank would be used, although interested foreign bidders would&#13;
be allowed to participate. Very small works which cannot be grouped into contracts of at least&#13;
US$250,000 would be procured on the basis of price quotations from at least three eligible&#13;
contractors, provided they do not exceed US$5.9 million in the aggregate. Contracts for goods&#13;
exceeding US$250,000 would be awarded through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) following&#13;
Bank procurement guidelines and using Bank-issued Standard Bidding Documents. Contracts for&#13;
goods expected to cost between US$50,000 and US$250,000, not exceeding an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$11.9 million, would be procured under NCB. Office equipment, furniture and other similar goods&#13;
expected to cost less than US$50,000 per contract would be awarded on the basis of evaluation of&#13;
price quotations invited from at least three suppliers, provided they do not exceed an aggregate of&#13;
US$1.7 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
2.27   Consultant services, training and studies. The Bank's "Guidelines on the Use of Consultants&#13;
by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" would govern all&#13;
consultancies financed under the project.&#13;
2.28   Prior Review by the Bank. All ICB contracts, the first two NCB contracts each for goods and&#13;
works, and NCB contracts exceeding US$0.5 million for works and US$200,000 for goods would be&#13;
subject to prior Bank review of bidding documents, bid evaluation, award proposals and final&#13;
contracts. In addition, prior review of all consultant contracts will be required for contracts with&#13;
individuals exceeding US$30,000 and contracts with firms exceeding US$100,000. Prior review&#13;
procedures would cover about 50% of Bank-financed procurement, which is acceptable given the&#13;
characteristics of the project. INPARQUES has recently issued procurement norms to make their&#13;
procedures consistent with Bank procurement guidelines. For bid evaluation purposes, a margin of&#13;
preference in accordance with Bank guidelines may be granted to local manufacturers for goods&#13;
procured under ICB.&#13;

Disbursements&#13;
2.29   The project has a 5-year disbursement period and the Closing Date would be June 30, 2000.&#13;
There are no Standard Disbursement Profiles for Venezuela, and the estimated disbursement&#13;
schedule has been determined by evaluating the implementation capacity of the implementing agency&#13;
and the estimated availability of counterpart funding. The Loan would be disbursed against eligible&#13;
project expenditures at the rates of: (a) 65% for civil works; (b) 100% for foreign supplied and 60%&#13;
for locally supplied equipment, machinery, vehicles and furniture; (c) 100% net of taxes for technical&#13;
assistance, training and studies; and (d) operating costs for the Project Coordinating Unit at a rate&#13;
of 100% for the first US$150,000 in disbursements, 75% for the next US$150,000, and 50% thereafter&#13;
(Annex 6, Table 6). Except for contracts requiring prior review, disbursement would be made against&#13;
certified statement of expenditures (SOE) for which detailed documentation evidencing expenditures&#13;
would be made available for the required audit and also for review by the Bank supervision missions.&#13;
2.30   Retroactive financing for technical assistance, training, studies, civil works and equipment&#13;
would be provided for an estimated US$2.5 million (5% of the Loan) in respect of eligible&#13;
expenditures incurred between January 1, 1993 and Loan signing, expected in mid-1995, both to&#13;
enable the efficient execution of project activities in 1995, and in light of the unusual history of this&#13;
project. The original Loan for a National Parks Management Project was approved by the World&#13;
Bank Board of Directors in December 1992, withdrawn in June 1994 and is now being reactivated&#13;
as a new project (para 2.2). During 1993 and 1994, while the fate of the original Loan was uncertain,&#13;
INPARQUES carried out a number of project activities on a limited scale using its own budget, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
these activities were reviewed during the appraisal mission. Documents to support the Withdrawal&#13;
Application for retroactive financing were received before negotiations (para 3.1(e)).&#13;
2.31   There is no Special Account proposed for the project. Because of extremely tight limits on&#13;
external borrowing, Government and the Bank have agreed that Bank disbursements would be made&#13;
only as the project is physically implemented and all initial payments to suppliers would be made by&#13;
INPARQUES using its own funds. Should the situation change and/or if the desirability of opening&#13;
a Special Account becomes more evident during project implementation, the possibility of amending&#13;
the Loan Agreement to establish a Special Account may be considered.&#13;
Benefits&#13;
2.32   Project impact indicators are shown in Annex 7, Appendix 1-B. Support for national parks&#13;
and other priority areas in Venezuela is justified from both a national and an international standpoint.&#13;
Many of these areas contain the critical watersheds of major rivers and storage reservoirs which are&#13;
significant for power, agriculture and water supply; and/or have significant recreational and eco-&#13;
tourism potential that could be further developed provided their natural resource base is protected&#13;
and managed in a sustainable manner. An effort has been made to estimate their value for&#13;
illustrative purposes, as summarized below.&#13;
(a)   Watershed Protection. The Canaima national park includes more than one-third of&#13;
the catchment area of the Guri hydroelectric dam on the Caroni River. It is&#13;
estimated that if this catchment area were not protected, accelerated erosion and&#13;
downstream sedimentation due to agriculture and logging would reduce the dam's&#13;
useful life by between 10% and 15%. Given an expected life of 60 years and a total&#13;
cost of US$9.1 billion (1990 prices), at a discount rate of 10%, the net present value&#13;
of the additional energy investments that would be required to compensate for the&#13;
shortened life of the reservoir (and which could be avoided through proper watershed&#13;
protection in two national parks) could range from about US$54 million to about&#13;
US$82 million.&#13;
(b)   There is no comprehensive assessment of the role of national parks in protecting the&#13;
country's urban water supplies but available information suggests that the offtake&#13;
generated from 13 national parks which is used to satisfy the needs of about 9.6&#13;
million people (i.e., 60% of the entire national population), is 27 m3/sec of water.&#13;
According to MARNR's estimates, water availability from the above mentioned parks&#13;
could diminish by 10% and 30% over the next 20 years because of the combined&#13;
effects of deforestation and erosion. Failure to protect these catchments could thus&#13;
result in the Government's having to reinvest in the replacement of water supply&#13;
losses (about 8 m3/sec). Assuming that replacement investment would be evenly&#13;
distributed over 20 years, at an average cost of US$25.0 millon per m3, the&#13;
conservation of the upper basins in the national parks would save replacement&#13;
investments with a present value of between US$80 million and US$160 millon.&#13;
(c)   While specific data to estimate the impact of the national parks on rainfed agriculture&#13;
is lacking, rough calculations made for irrigated agriculture indicate that some 20%&#13;
of the total irrigated area in Venezuela depends on surface or groundwater which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
originates in national parks. The life span of the irrigation works averages 10 years&#13;
for private wells and surface derivations and 30 years for public reservoirs, with&#13;
investment in irrigation ranging from US$1,000 per ha for private groundwater&#13;
irrigation to US$5,000 per ha for more expensive public projects. The net present&#13;
value of investment losses stemming from the lack of national park conservation could&#13;
range from US$10 million to US$30 million.&#13;
(d)   Maintenance of Ecological Processes in Coastal Marine Ecosystem. The mangrove&#13;
ecosystem constitutes a reservoir, refuge and breeding and feeding grounds for many&#13;
commercial species of plants and animals. The appraisal mission estimated that within&#13;
the marine parks to be included in the project there are approximately 15,000 ha of&#13;
mangrove forest. The economic value of similar highly productive ecosystems varies&#13;
from US$500 to 1,500/ha/year for other Caribbean areas with conditions similar to&#13;
those of Venezuela (Hamilton/Snedaker, 1984)Y Because mangrove ecosystems are&#13;
very fragile and highly vulnerable to urban and commercial pressures, severe&#13;
degradation can be expected if they are not properly protected. Assuming that half&#13;
the mangrove areas were lost over a 10-year period, if not protected as national parks,&#13;
and considering the lowest estimates of harvest value, the net present value of&#13;
potential losses over a 30-year period would be about US$7 million.&#13;
(e)    Recreation benefits. INPARQUES national parks receive an average of 1 million&#13;
visitors a year while INPARQUES urban parks are visited by more than 10 million&#13;
people a year. These visitors are charged small entrance and parking fees by&#13;
INPARQUES. While the visitors willingness to pay for the recreational experience,&#13;
the measure of the value of the recreational experience to consumers, is unknown,&#13;
it must be greater or equal than the fees they pay to INPARQUES. It is expected&#13;
that as a result of this project and INPARQUES regular programs, by the year 2000&#13;
INPARQUES will be able to generate about US$6 million a year from a variety of&#13;
visitors fees, concessions and licenses (see Annex 5). This represents a present value&#13;
of about US$34 million.&#13;
2.33  In summary, the estimated present value of the benefits of the protected areas under&#13;
INPARQUES, at a 10% discount rate, which would be lost without the protection of critical&#13;
watersheds and coastal ecosystems in the national parks, could range from over US$185 million to&#13;
about US$312 million. Other benefits from tourism and other potentially marketable products may&#13;
also be high, but the aggregate value cannot be determined from available information. It should be&#13;
stressed that these figures present only a partial idea of the magnitude of benefits accruing from&#13;
national parks conservation in Venezuela. There are also substantial benefits that accrue to the&#13;
global economy as a whole - carbon sequestration and biodiversity protection.  On carbon&#13;
sequestration alone and using very conservative values for the estimate of the world's willingness to&#13;
pay for each ton of carbon sequestered, benefits could approach US$150 million. On the other hand,&#13;
the full value of the above benefits cannot be attributed to the proposed project alone, since the&#13;
national parks are already in place and therefore only the benefits of incremental conservation should&#13;
be counted in a strict net present value analysis. However, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that&#13;
2y    Hamilton, L S. and S. C. Snedaker (1984). Handbook for Mangrove Area Management. IUCNIUNESCO/UNEP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
an effort on the scale of the proposed project is urgently required to ensure adequate management&#13;
and protection of the national parks, and that the cost of this effort would easily be exceeded by the&#13;
benefits that would accrue.&#13;
2.34  In addition, from the perspective of biodiversity preservation, despite its relatively small size,&#13;
Venezuela contains a vast array of neo-tropical ecosystems and is therefore considered to be among&#13;
the world's 10 most important sites of biological diversity (para. 1.3). Hence, protection of the&#13;
country's main coinservation areas would also have important, if unquantified, external benefits.&#13;
2.35   To try to give more precision to the quantifiable benefits accruing to the project, the project&#13;
will support a study to refine the economic valuation of Venezuela's National Parks system. Among&#13;
other things, this study will be instrumental in the design of policies to help INPARQUES capture&#13;
a larger share of the internal and external benefits of biodiversity protection in Venezuela (Annex&#13;
5).&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
2.36   Although national parks and other protected areas are the source of important economic&#13;
benefits for Venezuelan society, few of these benefits are captured directly by INPARQUES. For&#13;
that reason, like other national park administrations worldwide, INPARQUES depends heavily on&#13;
government budget appropriations. This has obvious drawbacks when fiscal problems arise.&#13;
Increasing the share of revenues collected directly from the public would enhance the administration&#13;
of most national park administrations in several ways: (a) operating costs would be insulated from&#13;
national budget fluctuations; (b) the demand for and the benefits of the national parks system would&#13;
become more visible and this in itself could help to attract new investment resources; (c) charging&#13;
for services would increase environmental awareness among the public; (d) the prospect of generating&#13;
revenues might stimulate the development of new, innovative ways to charge off-site consumers and&#13;
beneficiaries; and (e) under a scenario of limited increases in government transfers to INPARQUES,&#13;
higher own revenues would allow the agency to meet the higher recurrent costs from the project, thus&#13;
helping ensure its sustainability.&#13;
2.37   At present, INPARQUES annual expenditures are financed by government budgetary&#13;
allocations, private domestic and international donors, and its own resources (entrance fees to several&#13;
urban parks, user fees for some recreational facilities in a few national parks, and concession&#13;
payments from private firms which operate recreational or private infrastructure in national and urban&#13;
parks). Approximately 70% of INPARQUES annual expenditures have been for recurrent purposes.&#13;
The INPARQUES annual budget (own revenues plus transfers from the executive) peaked in 1992&#13;
at US$16 million and fell to US$10 million in 1994, due in part to the devaluation of the local&#13;
currency. During the same period, while federal budget allocations were decreasing, INPARQUES&#13;
own revenues more than doubled in constant terms, and in 1994 they accounted for 16% of the total&#13;
budget -- up from 6.8% in 1990.&#13;
2.38   Because of the project, Government will need to allocate to INPARQUES an incremental&#13;
US$5 to 6 million per year for 1996, 1997 and 1998 and about US$2 million for 1999. This&#13;
incremental Government funding represents about 55% of the project's local counterpart funding&#13;
requirements. The remaining 45% of local counterpart funding would come from redirecting part&#13;
of the regular INPARQUES investment and operating budgets to the project activities, assuming that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
the INPARQUES "normal' budget would remain at its 1991-92 level in real terms. With respect to&#13;
the long-term impact of the project on INPARQUES' recurrent costs, it is estimated that the project&#13;
will result in a 60% (about US$6.8 million) increase over 1994 recurrent expenditures (in real terms)&#13;
by the year 2000. As part of its Financial Plan (see below) INPARQUES intends that non-&#13;
Government budget receipts would grow to cover all incremental recurrent expenditures caused by&#13;
the project. This would mean that own revenues in the year 2000 would be about four times the&#13;
1994 figures and about twice the projected 1995 figures, a feasible target that is in line with the&#13;
growth of INPARQUES own revenues during the 1990-94 period. Under this scenario, the total&#13;
contribution from the Government would be feasible and INPARQUES would have a sufficiently&#13;
balanced funding position to cushion it against periodic fiscal constraints.&#13;
2.39   To ensure that the financial position improves as forecasted, INPARQUES is executing a&#13;
Financial Plan originally approved in October 1992. An updated version of the Financial Plan,&#13;
reviewed during appraisal, is shown in Annex 5 (para. 3.1(f)). An assurance was obtained during&#13;
negotiations that the Plan would be implemented in a satisfactory manner (para. 3.2(h)).&#13;
Implementation of the Financial Plan would be monitored closely throughout the project&#13;
implementation period. The main elements of the Financial Plan include:&#13;
(a)    Charging entry and parking fees in heavily visited parks which still do not collect them&#13;
and increasing fees in parks that already collect them.&#13;
(b)   Charging for other activities that depend substantially on the conservation of the&#13;
natural resources safeguarded within the park system (e.g., commercial fishing and&#13;
tourism company licenses, hotel taxes and water user fees); and charging fees for the&#13;
use of park lands by governmental or private telecommunications facilities, power&#13;
lines, pipelines or similar infrastructure located within or traversing the national parks.&#13;
(c)   Increasing the rank of the Office of Internal Revenue to a General Directorate&#13;
(already done), providing adequate staff and equipment for it to carry out its assigned&#13;
functions efficiently, and giving it the authority for assessing and monitoring tariffs and&#13;
revenue policies.&#13;
(d)   Assigning specific responsibilities within INPARQUES for the coordination of fund&#13;
raising among private national firms and international donors.&#13;
(e)   Launching a public information campaign explaining the rationale and objectives of&#13;
national parks tariff and fund-raising policies.&#13;
2.40  In addition -- and on the grounds that about 30% of the water consumed in Venezuela is&#13;
generated in the national parks -- INPARQUES would investigate the legal viability of capturing part&#13;
of a new tariff, proposed by the President's Office on June 5, 1992, for watershed protection, based&#13;
on an incremental 0.5% of the water tariffs and 1% of electricity tariffs.&#13;
Risks&#13;
2.41   Although there are no major project risks, implementation could be adversely affected by (a)&#13;
institutional weaknesses of INPARQUES; (b) counterpart funding constraints; and (c) annual limits&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
on external borrowing that could restrict Bank disbursements. With regard to possible institutional&#13;
weaknesses, INPARQUES is a well-established autonomous institution with a good track record to&#13;
date, but adequate project implementation would require improvements in its structure and skills and&#13;
the project would place considerable additional demands on its administrative, financial and technical&#13;
capacities. To address these institutional concerns, the project would support: (a) implementation&#13;
of a Decentralization and Administrative Reform Plan, shifting technical and administrative functions&#13;
from INPARQUES' central headquarters to its regional and field offices (para. 3.11); (b)&#13;
implementation of a Financial Plan to diversify INPARQUES sources of financial support and&#13;
thereby help to strengthen its financial sustainability beyond the project period (para. 3.22); and&#13;
(c) staff training and technical assistance (para. 3.10 and Annex 4). Also, building on successful past&#13;
collaborative efforts between the Government and NGOs, domestic and international NGOs and local&#13;
communities would participate in various project activities, thereby lessening some of the&#13;
implementation burden on INPARQUES (para. 2.21).&#13;
2.42   With regard to funding, the level of cost sharing by the Bank would be somewhat higher&#13;
(57%) than the average for other operations in Venezuela, given the strong environmental focus of&#13;
the project. Legislative approval giving Government authority to sign the Loan Agreement, the lack&#13;
of which caused the National Parks Management Project Loan to be withdrawn, has already been&#13;
obtained, satisfactory evidence has been received that the Executive branch has requested&#13;
authorization from the appropriate Congressional Commissions for World Bank disbursement in 1995&#13;
(para.3.1(g)), and an assurance was obtained at negotiations that INPARQUES would be provided&#13;
with adequate and timely counterpart funds to meet the balance of project funding needs (para.&#13;
3.2(i)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(a)   The INPARQUES Decentralization and Administrative Reform Plan would be&#13;
implemented in a satisfactory manner (para. 2.14).&#13;
(b)   The Participation Agreements between INPARQUES and PROFAUNA, SADA-&#13;
AMAZONAS and FAC, respectively, would be executed in a satisfactory manner&#13;
(para. 2.16).&#13;
(c)   By March 31 thereafter throughout the project implementation period, the draft&#13;
annual operating plan and proposed budget for the succeeding year would be made&#13;
available to the Bank for review and comments; by May 31 each year the Bank and&#13;
the Borrower would conduct a formal joint annual review; and the Bank would&#13;
receive a copy of the final annual plan and budget when they are approved (para.&#13;
2.18).&#13;
(d)   INPARQUES would invite an Annual Independent Evaluation Committee, including,&#13;
inter alia, representatives of relevant NGOs, to monitor and evaluate project&#13;
implementation progress, and the findings of the Committee would be sent to the&#13;
Bank no later than March 31 of each year, beginning in 1996 (para. 2.19).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
(e)   Copies of quarterly progress reports in an agreed format would be sent to the Bank&#13;
within 30 days of the end of the quarter (para. 2.19).&#13;

(h)   The INPARQUES Financial Plan to improve the financial sustainability of&#13;
INPARQUES would be implemented in a satisfactory manner (para. 2.39).&#13;
(i)    Adequate counterpart funding would be made available to the project in a timely&#13;
manner (para. 2.42).&#13;
3.3   Conditions of disbursement. Disbursements would not be made for activities related to&#13;
SADA-AMAZONAS and PROFAUNA, respectively, until revised Participation Agreements,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, are executed (para. 2.16).&#13;
3.4    Recommendation. Subject to the above agreements and conditions, the proposed project&#13;
would constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$55.0 million equivalent to the Republic of&#13;
Venezuela, repayable in 15 years, including a 5-year grace period, at the Bank's standard variable&#13;
interest rate.&#13;

VENEZUELA&#13;
INPARQUES PROJECr&#13;
Parks Management and Protection Component&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Relative to many other Latin American countries, Venezuela has higher&#13;
incomes per capita, a small but well-educated population, and a natural resource&#13;
base that still remains largely intact. The significance of its natural resources is&#13;
such that Venezuela is recognized internationally as being one of the world's&#13;
most biologically-diverse countries. Indicators of this diversity include more than&#13;
21,000 species of higher vascular plants, 5,000 of which are judged to be endemic&#13;
to Venezuela; some 1,300 species of birds out of a world total of 9,000; 40% of&#13;
3,300 known species of neotropical birds; and more than 300 species of mammals,&#13;
18 of which are classified as endangered. These abundant natural resources have&#13;
provided the basis for development over the past 50 years of a very&#13;
comprehensive national protected areas system.&#13;
2 .   Venezuela's earliest attempt at protecting its biological resources began&#13;
with the establishment of the Rancho Grande National Park in 1937 (now known&#13;
as Henri Pittier). This was followed by the creation of the country's first natural&#13;
monuments in the 1940s and the addition of three more parks in the 1950s.&#13;
TIhen, beginning in the 1960s, the system expanded more rapidly, a trend&#13;
attributable in part to the creation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock&#13;
(MAC) and the National Institue of Parks (INPARQUES). By the end of the&#13;
decade, four new national parks had been created, only to be surpassed in the&#13;
1970s with the creation of 17 more parks and 8 natural monuments. At present&#13;
the system has grown to include 43 national parks and 17 natural monuments,&#13;
which in total comprise 140,034 km2, or some 15% of the national territory.&#13;
3.    Major criteria used in the selection and creation of the country's&#13;
protected areas have included uniqueness and diversity of habitat; watershed&#13;
protection for water supply, power production and irrigation; and potential for&#13;
recreation and ecotourism development. Present interest in Venezuela's&#13;
protected areas, both nationally and internationally, is at an all-time high, as&#13;
reflected in the country's selection as the venue for the 1992 World Congress on&#13;
National Parks and Protected Areas.&#13;
4.    The recent rapid expansion of Venezuela's national system of protected&#13;
areas is laudable, but it is clear that this must now be followed by a period of&#13;
consolidation and more effective management of these areas. The large number&#13;
of newly created parks has far outstripped INPARQUES' ability to fulfill its&#13;
legally-mandated management responsibilities, partly because of its present fairly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
centralized structure and staffing/skills mix pattern, exacerbated by budgetary&#13;
constraints associated with declines in domestic oil revenues. The main issues to&#13;
be addressed include the absence or inadequacy of basic infrastructure and&#13;
equipment in many parks; insufficient and/or inadequately-trained human&#13;
resources; basic information gaps; and limited environmentally-based public&#13;
education and training programs.&#13;
5.    Data from a recent survey of 35 national parks indicate that two are&#13;
facing difficulties in terms of maintaining park integrity (Mochima and Canaima)&#13;
and two others are in a precarious condition (Aguaro-Guariquito and Morrocoy).&#13;
The threats to the remaining parks appear to be more "localized" in nature, with&#13;
the most significant impacts occurring in El Avila, Laguna de Tacarigua and Los&#13;
Roques. More recently, data compiled from an INPARQUES survey of park&#13;
superintendents indicated that the main problems for the parks situated north of&#13;
the Orinoco River were: fire, encroachment, illegal hunting and fishing, and&#13;
water pollution. Further to the south, in the Amazon region, accelerated&#13;
acculturation among the indigenous populations is resulting in unplanned land&#13;
clearing in proximity to some of the region's national parks and natural&#13;
monuments (e.g., Yapakana, Parima-Tapirapeco and Duida-Marahuaca national&#13;
parks and the natural monuments in the areas of the Autana-Cao-Sipapo and&#13;
Valle del Manapiare groups). Other issues include illegal mining and hunting.&#13;
While data are poor, it is thought that the country's wildlife refuges and reserves&#13;
suffer from many of the same pressures as those faced by the national parks in&#13;
the same areas.&#13;
Component Description&#13;
6.    The objective of the proposed component is to improve the conservation&#13;
of Venezuela's renewable natural resources by addressing the management issues&#13;
and other constraints identified above, and by increasing public awareness of the&#13;
role of national parks and reserves in supporting the country's present and future&#13;
development needs. Five sub-components would focus on the needs of: (i) 16&#13;
national parks north of the Orinoco River; (ii) 4 national parks and 2 natural&#13;
monuments in the State of Amazonas; (iii) 2 wildlife refuges; (iv) 7 urban or&#13;
recreational parks; and (v) fire prevention and control efforts throughout the&#13;
national park system.&#13;
7.    National Parks and Natural Monuments. This sub-component is designed&#13;
to promote more efficient administration and management of 16 national parks&#13;
north of the Orinoco River and of 4 national parks and natural monuments in&#13;
the State of Amazonas. Criteria used to select parks north of the Orinoco River&#13;
for inclusion in the project were: the existence or pending approval of a park&#13;
management plan (plan de ordenamiento); diverse representation of the country's&#13;
ecological regions; and a discernible need for management interventions based on&#13;
presence and degree of threat to park integrity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
8.    In parks north of the Orinoco River the project would finance:&#13;
(a)   Infrastructure needed to support administrative functions (offices,&#13;
residential facilities in isolated parks, and maintenance&#13;
warehouses), park protection (guard posts, access controls,&#13;
fencing, watch towers), environmental education and&#13;
interpretation (visitor and information centers, interpretative trails&#13;
and signs), and recreation and tourism (access road rehabilitation,&#13;
rehabilitation, recreational area development, observation towers),&#13;
and research.&#13;
(b)   Equipment for transport (trucks, boats, and motorcycles), office,&#13;
and field activities.&#13;
(c)   Incremental staffing for protection and resource management&#13;
activities and administration of the new field management units to&#13;
be established as part of INPARQUES' decentralization process.&#13;
9.    At present, Venezuela is the country with the largest contiguous area of&#13;
the Amazon under protection and the country with its largest share of&#13;
Amazonian territory under protection. In the State of Amazonas (SA),&#13;
Venezuela has legally established 4 large national parks, 5 natural monuments&#13;
protecting 15 tepuys (sandstone plateaux), and one biosphere reserve. In the&#13;
aggregate, these account for 47.5% of all protected areas in Venezuela and 36%&#13;
of the SA (not including the newly created Alto Orinoco-Casiquiare biosphere&#13;
reserve). The Venezuelan SA is still largely intact, with estimated deforestation&#13;
of only 0.5-1% (1985). It is also significant to note that, unlike the Brazilian&#13;
Amazon which is almost exclusively a lowland area, the Venezuelan Amazon&#13;
comprises six biogeographic regions (Huber and Cerda, 1990), which makes it&#13;
one of the most biologically diverse areas of the world.&#13;
10.   Since INPARQUES still has only a limited presence in the State of&#13;
Amazonas, including an office in Puerto Ayacucho with a total of fourteen staff,&#13;
it works in cooperation with the Autonomous Service for the Environmental&#13;
Development of the Amazon (SADA-AMAZONAS). SADA-AMAZONAS was&#13;
established in June 1989 under MARNR. The following year, in 1990, the&#13;
Alejandro de Humboldt Amazon Environmental Research Institute (CAIAH)&#13;
was established under SADA-AMAZONAS as Venezuela's response to an&#13;
understanding reached during the international meeting at which the presidents&#13;
of the countries involved signed the Treaty of Amazonian Cooperation (May 6,&#13;
1989).&#13;
11.   Under the proposed national parks management component, the project&#13;
would seek to establish an institutional and operational structure for&#13;
INPARQUES to meet minimal basic administrative, monitoring and patrol&#13;
functions in the State of Amazonas. Also, under the research component&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
(Annex 2), management plans would be developed for three of the four national&#13;
parks and two natural monuments, and an applied research program would be&#13;
established to increase knowledge about the natural resources of the Amazonian&#13;
parks and the main threats to their future preservation. Thus in addition to&#13;
activities (a) to (c) for parks north of the Orinoco River the specific activities&#13;
under the national parks management component for Amazonian parks would&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)    Construction of one central administrative office and a visitors'&#13;
center for INPARQUES in Puerto Ayacucho; to give support for&#13;
five professionals, 8 administrative and 4 support staff (to&#13;
supplement the present positions of Regional Director and his&#13;
assistant), and new residences and equipment for these staff.&#13;
(b)   Support for an aerial surveillance program for patrolling, food and&#13;
fuel support for the posts and emergencies. This program would&#13;
include the renting of small airplanes and helicopters.&#13;
(c)    Establishment of one sub-state office and operations center for&#13;
INPARQUES in La Esmeralda, with one professional, two&#13;
administrative and four support staff.&#13;
(d)   Support for the posts of six rangers and their assistants, and 13&#13;
guard posts with four park guards each. The ranger and guard&#13;
posts were selected to ensure the best control (airstrips, river&#13;
confluence, etc.) and would be equipped principally with radios,&#13;
boats and essential subsistence equipment.&#13;
12.   Wildlife Refuges. Two priority wildlife refuges (Cuare and Tortuga&#13;
Arrau) would be assisted under the project. Criteria used for their selection&#13;
were: significance as refuges for threatened or endangered wildlife; the existence&#13;
of (or soon to be approved) management plans; the presence of pressure or&#13;
threats to the habitat and/or specific species in the refuge; and proximity to&#13;
national parks included in the project (the Morrocoy and Cinaruco-Capanaparo&#13;
national parks, respectively). The project would support infrastructure,&#13;
equipment, and incremental personnel.&#13;
13.   Despite the proximity of national parks and refuges in Venezuela, and&#13;
the fact that they share common conservation objectives, these two types of&#13;
protected areas are managed as independent entities. This results in&#13;
administrative inefficiencies and could adversely impact on the well-being of the&#13;
resources and habitat in the respective areas. To address this problem, each of&#13;
the two refuge-national park complexes supported by the project would be&#13;
managed as integral protected area units. This will be accomplished through the&#13;
coordinated development of annual operating plans specifying collaborative&#13;
activities, including coordinated public information and environmental education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
programs, protection activities, and fire prevention and control. A cooperative&#13;
research program would be facilitated by the sharing of supportive research-&#13;
related infrastructure and equipment between PROFAUNA and INPARQUES&#13;
in each of the two protected area complexes.&#13;
14.   Urban Parks. An important characteristic of Venezuela is that the large&#13;
majority of the population is urban-based. This facilitates the development and&#13;
implementation of a cost-effective environmental education program, using the&#13;
country's recreational parks. These large, urban-based parks attract many users,&#13;
cutting across all socio-economic classes. A well-designed program supported by&#13;
the necessary infrastructure and equipment would be a highly cost-effective&#13;
means to increase consciousness and support for park conservation efforts. To&#13;
this end, seven recreational parks (Del Este "R6mulo Betancourt", Caricuao,&#13;
Guaiqueri, Andr6s Eloy Blanco, Jose Maria Ochoa Pile, Metropolitano de&#13;
Maracay, Galindo) have been identified for inclusion in the project. The&#13;
principal criteria used in their selection were proximity to the country's major&#13;
urban centers and one or more national parks, status of land ownership, and&#13;
estimated number of visitors. The main investments would consist of the&#13;
development or restoration of basic park infrastructure and selected public&#13;
attractions; the construction and equipment of educational cum information&#13;
centers in support of the project's environmental education sub-component; and&#13;
incremental personnel.&#13;
15.   Prevention and Combat of Forest Fires. INPARQUES' capability to&#13;
prevent and combat forest fires would be enhanced, building on the experience&#13;
of the 'Campamento de Incendios Pajaritos" in the El Avila national park. The&#13;
El Avila program consists basically of a small core of professional park staff, a&#13;
large network of trained volunteers for ad hoc search and rescue operations, and&#13;
a rapid response capability based on effective communications, transport, and fire&#13;
fighting equipment. During the wet season, personnel are used for preparing and&#13;
implementing fire prevention plans and educational programs.&#13;
16.   The fire prevention and combat subcomponent of the project would help&#13;
to extend this successful model to a total of 28 of Venezuela's most fire-prone&#13;
protected areas. The main investments would be for:&#13;
(a)    Construction of basic offices, residential quarters, and&#13;
garages/storage facilities in each of 9 principal and 8 auxiliary base&#13;
camps.&#13;
(b)   Vehicles and equipment for fire combat and transport, personal&#13;
protection, training and office support.&#13;
(c)    Personnel costs, including part-time contracting of instructors to&#13;
support training of INPARQUES' personnel and volunteer groups&#13;
in fire prevention and combat operations, and the contracting of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
fire combat personnel for six months each year during the fire&#13;
season. There would also be provision for a modest search and&#13;
rescue activity for selected parks where previous experience&#13;
justifies the need for increasing local INPARQUES' capacity.&#13;
3.    Another critical factor in reducing the risk of park fires is the&#13;
development of an effective public education campaign directed at reducing the&#13;
human causes of forest fires. This need would be addressed simultaneously,&#13;
under the project's public environmental education component (see Annex 3).&#13;

INPARQUES PROJECr&#13;
Environmental Research Component&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The emphasis on research for national parks management has been&#13;
growing fast over the last twenty years, as park management goals have shifted&#13;
from simple control of trespassers to more active resource management, with a&#13;
view to long-term sustainability. Also, the need to cope with increasing pressures&#13;
from conflicting demands -- tourism, local community concerns, national&#13;
development needs -- requires more and better problem-oriented research.&#13;
2.    The project's research component aims to: (a) help strengthen the role of&#13;
national parks as research resources for the country; (b) assist Venezuela to&#13;
safeguard its rights with respect to research findings and the possible commercial&#13;
use of its biodiversity resources; (c) focus research efforts and scarce resources&#13;
on issues which are relevant to the sustainable management of national parks;&#13;
(d) reinforce INPARQUES' capabilities to use research outcomes in the planning&#13;
and day to day management of national park conservation; (e) and strengthen&#13;
INPARQUES' ability to coordinate, foster and orient universities, NGOs and&#13;
other private entities to carry out priority environmental research in national&#13;
parks.&#13;
3.    The research component was designed in consultation with: (a)&#13;
INPARQUES, SADA-AMAZONAS and PROFAUNA, staff, both at the&#13;
headquarters and regional offices, (b) university researchers, and (c) local and&#13;
international NGOs. Furthermore two local consultants produced background&#13;
documents and conducted a survey among natural resource researchers in two of&#13;
Venezuelan Universities. A detailed presentation of the research program,&#13;
including organization, management, and dissemination activities can be found in&#13;
the following documents:&#13;

4.    The following is a short description of the research program main&#13;
components:&#13;
(a)   Establishment of a data bank on existing information on&#13;
Venezuela's national parks. This activity will strengthen the&#13;
capacity of INPARQUES' documentation center, to identify and&#13;
retrieve information.&#13;
(b)  Rapid Ecological and Social Assessments of 10 national parks.&#13;
INPARQUES has already applied this technique with support&#13;
from The Nature Conservancy (an international NGO). This sub-&#13;
component will use this proven approach to the study of the&#13;
following national parks: Canaima; El Avila; H. Pittier; Los&#13;
Roques; Maria Lionza; Mochima; Morrocoy; Sierra Nevada;&#13;
Tam*; Yurubf.&#13;
(c)   Preparation of thematic maps and geographic data bases for 8&#13;
National Parks: Canaima; El Avila, H. Pittier; Laguna de&#13;
Tacarigua; Mochima; Morrocoy; Sierra Nevada; TamL&#13;
(d)   Twenty-five applied research projects to help solve management&#13;
problems of non Amazonian national parks on issues such as&#13;
tourism, fire, the activities of local populations in national parks&#13;
and resource inventories and economic valuation of park services.&#13;
Preliminary proposals for 23 research projects and detailed criteria&#13;
for the management of this component are to be found in C.R.&#13;
Blanco document mentioned above. They include: (i) tourism&#13;
impact and development of green tourism in 7 national parks --&#13;
Los Roques, Laguna de Tacarigua, Canaima, Mochima, Morrocoy,&#13;
Maria Lionza and Sierra Nevada; (ii) Fire prevention studies in&#13;
parks -- Avila, Yurubf and Cinaruco-Capanaparo; (iii) Impact of&#13;
farming and fishing in 5 national parks. -- Mochima (2 studies),&#13;
Tami, Yurubf, Sierra Nevada, and Cinaruco-Capanaparo; (iv)&#13;
Biodiversity surveys in 5 national parks --Tamd, Sierra Nevada,&#13;
Canaima, Cerro Copey and Cinaruco-Capanaparo; (v)&#13;

Autana-Sipapo and Ventuari Natural Monuments.&#13;
(g)   In collaboration with SADA-AMAZONAS, 6 applied research&#13;
projects in the Amazonian National parks as follows: (i) tourism&#13;
impact assessment; (ii) impact of subsistence activities on the&#13;
parks and their surroundings; (iii) impact of mining activities; (iv)&#13;
health problems of indigenous populations in Amazonian natural&#13;
parks; (v) indigenous use of forest resources; and (vi) study of&#13;
endangered and sensitive botanic species.&#13;
(h)   In collaboration with PROFAUNA, four wildlife population&#13;
studies and management programs as follows: wildlife turtles&#13;
monitoring; turtles management, oysters farming; alligators study&#13;
and monitoring.&#13;
(i)   In collaboration with PROFAUNA the equipment for two&#13;
scientific stations to be jointly used by PROFAUNA and&#13;

(n)   Construction of five stations to support research activities. They&#13;
will be located in Laguna de Tacarigua, Canaima, Tama, Cinaruco&#13;
- Capanaparo and Morrocoy . The last two stations will be&#13;
equipped (see component Yi above) and will be operated by&#13;
PROFAUNA on a permanent basis. The first three stations will&#13;
not be equipped, as they will be used to support non permanent&#13;
research programs and will also be available for rent to&#13;
Universities, NGOs and other research projects. (The costs of this&#13;
sub-component appear in the project's Strengthening of Parks&#13;
Management and Protection component).&#13;

VENEZUELA&#13;
INPARQUES PROJECr&#13;
Environmental Education Component&#13;
Backgfround&#13;
1.  INPARQUES presently has two units dedicated to environmental education: (a) the&#13;
Directorate of Environmental Education and Recreation, under the General Sectoral&#13;
Directorate of Parks and Recreation, which deals mainly with educational activities in the&#13;
urban recreational parks; and (b) the Environmental Education, Interpretation and&#13;
Dissemination Division, under the General Sectoral Directorate of National Parks, which&#13;
works in the national parks.&#13;
2. INPARQUES' educational activities can be classified as active and passive. Active&#13;
education involves direct interaction with the public through specially trained personnel&#13;
such as guides or facilitators (e.g., excursions and camping events, guided tours, cultural&#13;
events, etc.). Passive education involves the preparation and dissemination of&#13;
environmental messages without such direct interaction (e.g., audiovisual and printed&#13;
materials, signs, exhibitions, etc.). In addition, INPARQUES provides training for&#13;
environmental education facilitators (e.g., workshops for guides of ecological games,&#13;
camping guides, guides for the interpretation of nature, basic school teachers, etc.).&#13;
Environmental Education Component&#13;
3. The project would expand environmental education activities, both at the regional and&#13;
local levels, to disseminate information, raise the level of knowledge about environmental&#13;
issues and their linkages with economic development, and engage the active participation of&#13;
the community in supporting environmental conservation. The focus would be on three&#13;
groups: (a) communities of fishermen, hunters, farmers and others residing in areas&#13;
adjacent to national parks; (b) school age children, youths and their families, and volunteer&#13;
conservation associations; and (c) the broader public, through educational messages to be&#13;
read or heard in visitors' centers, on radio or television, etc.&#13;
4.  Over a five-year period, the project would train at least 4,500 guides and facilitators&#13;
more than 100,000 persons would be exposed to active education programs; and more than&#13;
eight million persons would be exposed to various kinds of environmental education&#13;
messages. If successful, this public educational effort should lead to noticeable changes in&#13;
public perceptions and behavior, in support of natural resource conservation. The strategy&#13;
for reaching this relatively large number of people is based on:&#13;
(a)   Intensive educational use of the recreational parks which serve some of&#13;
Venezuela's largest urban centers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
(b)   Maximizing the multiplier effect of facilitators and guides (both volunteers and&#13;
part-time workers who are not regular INPARQUES' staff).&#13;
(c)   The strategic location of Information Centers and Visitors Centers in the&#13;
national and recreational parks.&#13;
5. Consistent with its overall decentralization plans, INPARQUES' educational activities&#13;
would be regionalized. A small central office in Caracas would be responsible for strategic&#13;
planning, national coordination and program evaluation. Regional coordinators located in&#13;
INPARQUES' regional offices would be responsible for regional planning; and for liaison&#13;
with public institutions, NGOs and community groups. State coordinators and their staff&#13;
would be based either in INPARQUES' state offices or in the Visitors Centers of the&#13;
national and recreational parks and monuments.&#13;
6. Regional coordinators would be directly responsible for managing facilitators and&#13;
guides, coordinating with local fire prevention and combat efforts, and maintaining liaison&#13;
with local community associations, local and international NGOs, educational groups and&#13;
the staff of PROFAUNA.&#13;
7. The project would support educational and planning equipment and materials for the&#13;
Central Office, Visitors Centers and Information Centers; training costs; and incremental&#13;
staffing costs. The detailed description of the component activities, its organization and&#13;
management is to be found in the document:&#13;
'Venezuela, Proyecto INPARQUES - Banco Mundial. Documento de Trabajo.&#13;
Componente Educaci6n Ambiental", 1992 (in Spanish, in project files)&#13;
8. Other activities related to the Environmental Education Component, which are&#13;
included in other project components are:&#13;
(a) A limited number of facilities to be built in national parks and recreational&#13;
parks to support education activities. The cost of this sub-component is&#13;
budgeted in the project's Strengthening of Parks Management and Protection&#13;
component.&#13;
(b) A consultant specialized in community environmental education and extension&#13;
that would be retained on a part-time basis during the project years 1, 3 and 5,&#13;
to orient and evaluate INPARQUES' educational program. The cost of this&#13;
consultant is budgeted in the project's Institutional Development component.&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;

VENFZUELA&#13;
INPARQUES PROJECr&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    By Latin American standards, INPARQUES is a relatively successful protected areas&#13;
management agency. Most of the wildlands and parks for which INPARQUES is responsible&#13;
are not "paper parks", but rather have at least some basic infrastructure and on-site&#13;
management activities. Total visits to the urban parks and wildlands exceed 10 million and one&#13;
million a year, respectively. In addition, INPARQUES has a sizable cadre of well-trained and&#13;
motivated personnel at both the technical and administrative levels. The fire control program&#13;
and the award-winning environmental education program are excellent examples of how to&#13;
involve the larger public in protected areas management.&#13;
2.    Nonetheless, various institutional weaknesses affect INPARQUES' capability. For the&#13;
most part, these relate to the over-centralization of administrative and technical support&#13;
functions, and staffing, in Caracas, which results in inefficient servicing and backstopping of the&#13;
administrative needs (programming, budgeting, purchasing, contracting, personnel services and&#13;
technical support) of the more distant parks. Until recently, all parks near Caracas, and some&#13;
others as far away as Morrocoy, as well as most special programs (e.g., environmental&#13;
education, fire prevention and control) were micro-managed from the central office. Hence,&#13;
an exceedingly high number of employees are based and administered out of Caracas&#13;
(essentially, INPARQUES' relative levels of staff strength at the central, regional and state,&#13;
and park levels is an inverted pyramid). At present (December 1994), INPARQUES has 1,375&#13;
staff, of which 1,164 are permanent employees and 207 are on short-term contracts. Of the&#13;
permanent staff, 217 are professional and technical, 194 administrative, and 710 laborers. Of&#13;
the total permanent and contracted staff, 311 are assigned to the central office in Caracas and&#13;
to the Capital Region; an additional 11 work on the fire prevention and control special&#13;
program managed out of Caracas and many of these are therefore physically located in Caracas.&#13;
Only 411 are assigned to regional and state offices and to parks not managed from Caracas.&#13;
Little differentiation is made between the role of Caracas as a national headquarters,&#13;
responding to the needs of all national parks, and its regular support of those parks located in&#13;
the capital region.&#13;
3.    At the same time, the number of regional offices is greater than necessary, and they do&#13;
not possess the critical staff, infrastructure and equipment, training, or authority to be able to&#13;
exercise direct administrative or technical functions in the parks. On the other hand, their&#13;
staffing levels exceed those needed to discharge day-to-day support functions for the parks.&#13;
At the park level, INPARQUES' field strength is very low, in terms of the supervisory,&#13;
technical and ranger staff needed to deal with fire control, poaching, visitor management, etc.&#13;
INPARQUES currently has only about 231 rangers, most with less than a high school&#13;
education and with limited specialized training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
4.    Finally, despite the centralization of staff numbers and skills, INPARQUES needs&#13;
further strengthening in the areas of strategic planning and policy to set and implement the&#13;
institution's long-term goals; and financial planning to improve INPARQUES' sustainability,&#13;
through improved systems of fee charging and collection, and better mobilization of domestic&#13;
and international public and private support. INPARQUES currently relies on annual central&#13;
government budgets and services provided by state and local governments for most of its&#13;
requirements. Although it has made important strides in recent years, INPARQUES still has&#13;
relatively little experience in fund raising and proposal writing to obtain support from other&#13;
sources.&#13;
Institutional Development Component - Decentralization and Administrative Reform&#13;
5.    To address the above issues, INPARQUES has developed a Decentralization and&#13;
Administrative Reform Plan, which is under implementation and which the project would&#13;
continue to support. The plan was reviewed during appraisal. The main elements include a&#13;
realignment of the institutional chain of command and structure; shifting to the regions and&#13;
state offices of many of the functions currently carried out by the central office; expansion of&#13;
park rangers and other staff and infrastructure at park level; strengthening of the capacity of&#13;
a much leaner and more efficient central office to supervise and coordinate planning, policy,&#13;
administrative procedures and technical support; reform of INPARQUES' recruitment, training&#13;
and incentives policies to professionalize and upgrade staff at all levels; and essential&#13;
investments in training, infrastructure and equipment to implement these changes.&#13;
6.    A revamped and streamlined INPARQUES, better equipped to complete its mission,&#13;
is the guiding objective of the institutional strengthening component. Eight specific goals are&#13;
as follows:&#13;
(a)   Strengthening of the senior management and operations of the institution at all&#13;
levels through a reformed, leaner management structure.&#13;
(b)   Development of a comprehensive training program for current and new staff,&#13;
and of career incentives for improving personnel performance.&#13;
(c)    Greater delegation of administrative and operational responsibility to regional&#13;
offices and field management units.&#13;
(d)   Decentralization of the management of urban recreational areas and nature&#13;
reserves of primarily local or regional importance to other institutions.&#13;
(e)   Maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of INPARQUES' limited financial&#13;
and human resources and its capacity to generate a greater share of its own&#13;
operating expenses.&#13;
(fi)   Strengthening of INPARQUES' capacity to draw on the influence and technical&#13;
and financial support of potential collaborators at both the national and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
international level.&#13;
(g)   Increasing citizen participation at all levels in planning, policy making and&#13;
program implementation of INPARQUES.&#13;
7.    Central Office Reorganization. INPARQUES has already taken important steps for&#13;
the reorganization of the Central Office. To function efficiently, INPARQUES' central office&#13;
should not get involved in the day-to-day operations of parks or special programs. As part of&#13;
the Decentralization and Administrative Reform Plan, on October 21, 1993, the National&#13;
Capital Region Office was created absorbing all personnel and responsibilities attached at the&#13;
time to the central office for management and supervision of the national parks and recreation&#13;
areas in the Federal Department, Miranda and federal dependent territories.&#13;
8.    Responsibility for 11 of the 13 special programs existing in 1992 was passed to the&#13;
National Capital Regional Office on October 21, 1993. Progress is being made on the&#13;
elimination of the special program of the park Los Roques. The special fire fighting related&#13;
program of search, rescue and life saving will remain as a special program at the central level&#13;
because it covers the entire country and it implies the coordination between a number of&#13;
agencies.&#13;
9.    As part of the continuing implementation of the plan a number of functions which are&#13;
currently dispersed and sometimes duplicated among the sectoral directorates of national parks,&#13;
infrastructure and recreational parks would be combined by functional area. The technical staff&#13;
at the central level would not have direct supervisory responsibilities for their programmatic&#13;
areas at the region and park level. They would instead play a strong role in backstopping&#13;
regional staff and in defining overall policy and procedures for their areas of technical&#13;
expertise. Many tasks currently carried out directly by INPARQUES' staff would be contracted&#13;
out, improving flexibility and reducing costs.&#13;
10.   Purchases of up to Bs. 2 million, contracts for services up to Bs. 3.5 million and those&#13;
for construction up to Bs. 4 million (all in 1995 Bolivares) would be handled by the regions,&#13;
as well as cooperative agreements and concessions which do not commit land and buildings for&#13;
the long-term. Therefore, the role of the central office administrative support staff would be&#13;
limited to only very large purchases and large contracts, cooperative agreements, and overall&#13;
coordination and definition of operational plans, budgets, finance, purchases, and norms and&#13;
procedures (e.g., bidding, disbursements, etc.).&#13;
11.   The total staff size of the central office would be around 150 individuals: nearly 100 less&#13;
employees than in 1992. However, the professional profile would be greatly enhanced, with&#13;
fewer unskilled workers and lower-level technicians and more professionals. higher level&#13;
technicians and more experienced secretaries.  Through the training sub-component,&#13;
opportunities would be offered to all INPARQUES professional and technical staff to increase&#13;
their capacity or gain proficiency in performing new tasks.&#13;
12.   Regional Office Reorganization. As a fundamental step in the decentralization and&#13;
administrative strengthening process, INPARQUES' 15 regional offices would be consolidated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
into eight greatly strengthened offices with greater responsibilities, staff levels, and geographic&#13;
scopes. Three regional offices have already been established. The regions, the states, and the&#13;
national parks and monuments they include, would be the following:&#13;
(a)   National Capital Region (headquartered in Caracas, but not at the central&#13;
office). This region would include the Federal District, Miranda, and federal&#13;
territories. Parks and monuments in this region would include Guatopo,&#13;
Tacarigua, El Avila, Macarao, Los Roques, Cueva Alfredo Jahn, and Pico&#13;
Codazzi. It was created on October 21, 1993.&#13;
(b)   Falcon-Zulia Region (headquartered in Coro, Falcon), and including the states&#13;
of Falcon and Zulia. Parks and monuments in the region would include Perija,&#13;
Cienega de Catatumbo, Morrocoy, Quebrada de la Cueva del Toro, Medanos&#13;
de Coro, Sierra de San Luis, and the Cerro Santa Ana. It was created on&#13;
October 21, 1993.&#13;
(c)   CentrocOocidente Region (headquartered in Barquisimeto), and including the&#13;
states of Lara, Yaracuy and Portuguesa. Parks and monuments in the region&#13;
would be Yacambu, Terrepaima, Cerro Saroche, Loma de Le6n, Shurubi, Maria&#13;
Lionza, Dinira, and Guache. To be created in 1997.&#13;
(d)   Amazonas Region (headquartered in Puerto Ayacucho), would include only&#13;
parks and monuments in the State of Amazonas. They are Serranfa La&#13;
Neblina, Yapacana, Duida-Marahuaka, Parima-Tapirapeco, Piedra de Cocuy,&#13;
Cerro Autana, and that part of the Tepuys Natural Monuments that is in the&#13;
State of Amazonas. It was created on November 8, 1993.&#13;
(e)   Andean Region (headquartered in MWrida), would include the states of MWrida,&#13;
Trujillo, Tichira and Barinas, and the parks and monuments of Sierra Nevada,&#13;
Sierra La Culata, Laguna de Arao, La Chorrera-La Gonz6lez, Guramacoy, El&#13;
Tam*, Chorro del Indio, Los Paramos de Batall6n y la Negra, and Urivante.&#13;
To be created in 1997.&#13;
(f)   Nororiente Region (headquartered in Ciudad Bolivar), would include the states&#13;
of Sucre, AnzoAtegui and Nueva Esparta, and the parks and monuments of&#13;
Laguna de la Restinga, Cerro El Copey, Laguna de la Merites, Tetas de Maria&#13;
Guevara, Cerros Matasiete y Guamuri, Mochima, Peninsula de Paria, and&#13;
Turuepano. To be created in 1996.&#13;
(g)   Southeast Region (headquartered in Maturfn) would include the states of&#13;
Bolivar, Delta and Monagas, and the parks and monuments of Canaim4, Jaua-&#13;
Sarisarinama, El Guacharo, Alejandro de Humboldt, Mariusa-Delta, and&#13;
Tepuyes in the state of Bolivar. To be created in 1996.&#13;
(h)   Centro Region (headquartered in Maracay), would include the states of Aragua&#13;
and Carabobo and the parks of Henri Pittier, San Est6ban and Platill6n. To&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
be created in 1996.&#13;
13.   Each regional office would house about 12 professional employees, five technicians,&#13;
four secretaries and one worker.  Each Regional Office would also include a State&#13;
Coordinating Office. It would be responsible for direct supervision and logistical support to&#13;
all management units within the state (or states, if more than one state is in a region),&#13;
provision of information and formal and informal environmental education to the public about&#13;
the national park system, and coordination of activities with and seeking of support from state&#13;
and local government agencies, other national agencies, and the private sector. Each office&#13;
would also coordinate volunteer recruitment for their state(s), a function that would become&#13;
increasingly important in INPARQUES. The State Coordinator would be a professional and&#13;
he/she would be supported by an executive assistant (a technician) and a secretary. The size&#13;
of this office would be a function of the number of states covered by the regional office and&#13;
the importance of the parks within each state. In states where little construction activity is&#13;
planned, the design specialist and works supervisor positions could be combined into a post for&#13;
one architect or engineer. The total number of full time staff for the eight regional offices is&#13;
estimated at about 178, with an additional 24 staff for the 8 State Coordinating Offices&#13;
associated with the regional offices. Wherever possible, when there are several nearby&#13;
protected areas for which INPARQUES has responsibility, these would be managed by a single&#13;
superintendent with overall supervisory responsibility.&#13;
14.   To test the viability of this model INPARQUES would review the experience of the&#13;
three regional offices created in 1993 by the end of 1995 and propose the alterations to the&#13;
Decentralization and Administrative Reform Plan stemming from the review. This review&#13;
should address the size of the area covered by the offices and their staffing needs.&#13;
15.   Field Management Units. When several protected areas are located in close proximity&#13;
(eg., a national park and two nearby monuments; a group of tepuy monument sites; several&#13;
recreation areas; or a park, monument and recreation area), these should become a single&#13;
management unit with one superintendent wherever this is feasible. Many sectors of large&#13;
national parks are much more complex in their management than small recreation areas and&#13;
national monuments or even small national parks. Thus, a sector chief for a large complex&#13;
national park should be hierarchically equal to directors of smaller and less complex individual&#13;
management units. At the management unit level, the number of professional, technical and&#13;
support staff needed would vary considerably. However, the basic outline of responsibilities&#13;
by program would remain the same, even though in smaller and less complicated areas an&#13;
individual employee might have to fulfill a wider range of functions.&#13;
16.   The management structure would include the superintendent and protection, resource&#13;
management, and administration divisions. Like at the regional level, no specific drivers,&#13;
maintenance or security personnel would be on permanent payroll. Specific construction jobs,&#13;
research, etc., would all be done by contract. The size of the revolving or petty cash fund for&#13;
each management unit would be increased to levels which permit purchase of most supplies,&#13;
disposable equipment, and similar items without requiring intervention by state or regional&#13;
offices. A limited number of the largest and most complex parks, mainly south of the Orinoco&#13;
where management arrangements are the weakest (Canaima, Mariusa, Cinaruco-Capanaparo,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
Guariquito, and Amazon parks and tepuys), and those parks with the greatest public impact&#13;
and management threats, would require special strengthening measures.&#13;
17.   Current levels of staff at almost all national parks and monuments in Venezuela are&#13;
still too low to guarantee effective protection and address the basic needs which were identified&#13;
through the rapid analysis of management problems which was carried out during project&#13;
preparation. While it is possible to reduce staff greatly at INPARQUES' central office, and&#13;
to make a significant improvement in effectiveness without a major increase in staff numbers&#13;
at the regional and state offices, the same does not follow for individual parks and monuments.&#13;
18.   Recreational Parks. Unlike the national parks and monuments, for which the central&#13;
government is unequivocally responsible under both national law and international agreements,&#13;
many recreational parks are already managed by state and local governments, NGOs and&#13;
commissions. INPARQUES would further reduce its role in managing urban recreation areas.&#13;
INPARQUES has already taken important strides in passing urban park management&#13;
responsibilities to local and state governments. From 107 urban parks in 1992, 5 were&#13;
transferred in 1993, 3 in 1994 and 6 transfers are expected for 1995, reducing the total number&#13;
of urban parks to 93. The target is to reduce these to about 50 by the end of the project.&#13;
INPARQUES would seek to remain involved in the management of mainly recreational parks&#13;
in major population hubs, which can be used for public education purposes to reinforce&#13;
conservation messages regarding the importance of the national parks and monuments to a&#13;
large urban audience of potential users and/or citizens who may never visit the more remote&#13;
parks and monuments. For those parks which would be turned over to state and municipal&#13;
governments, NGOs and inter-institutional groups, INPARQUES would continue to play a&#13;
technical assistance role.&#13;
Training&#13;
19.   The project training sub-component would support INPARQUES' management and&#13;
staff in carrying out the Decentralization and Administrative Reform Plan and in implementing&#13;
the project. This sub-component would finance:&#13;
(a)   Formal training courses coordinated by INPARQUES in three high priority&#13;
areas covering about 65 different course modules: (i) management, financial&#13;
and administration skills, techniques and procedures; (ii) park management and&#13;
related technical subjects; and (iii) computer skills.&#13;
(b)   Equipment and other investments needed to carry out the training programs at:&#13;
(i) the Rancho Grande Training Center (an existing building in the Henri&#13;
Pittier Nation Park, which requires rehabilitation and furnishing); and (ii) the&#13;
Training Coordination Unit (involving an extension of about 70 m2 which&#13;
would be added to INPARQUES' existing single-story headquarters building).&#13;
(c)   Selected training activities offered outside of INPARQUES, including some&#13;
short-term foreign study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
(d)   Acquisition of supplemental training materials (e.g., technical books) for&#13;
INPARQUES' regional and central offices, major national park ranger posts,&#13;
and the library at the Rancho Grande Training Center.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
20.   The project technical assistance sub-component would finance approximately 29&#13;
consultant-years of specialists to advise INPARQUES on critical administrative and technical&#13;
matters. Six of the consultants would work with INPARQUES counterpart staff to bring about&#13;
rapid improvements in the areas of:&#13;
(a)   administration of goods and services&#13;
(b)   personnel management&#13;
(c)   internal control&#13;
(d)   management of civil works&#13;
(e)   planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation&#13;
(f)   financial management&#13;
21.   Terms of reference for these six specialists were reviewed and agreed during appraisal.&#13;
These consultants would begin work well before the date of loan effectiveness, under&#13;
retroactive financing. INPARQUES is also preparing terms of reference for specialists in the&#13;
following areas:&#13;
(a)   Overall project administration, with particular attention to timely and smooth&#13;
execution of INPARQUES' Decentralization and Administrative Reform Plan.&#13;
(b)   Improving the management of national and recreational parks.&#13;
(c)   Implementation and fine-tuning of INPARQUES' training program.&#13;
(d)   Implementation of the project applied research component.&#13;
(e)   Environmental education and promotion of local community&#13;
participation in park management.&#13;
(f)    Analysis of options to improve INPARQUES' recurrent cost recovery.&#13;
(g)   Mobilization of external financing and support from international development&#13;
agencies, NGOs, private foundations and businesses, etc.&#13;
(h)   Economic valuation of protected areas.&#13;

Terms of Reference&#13;
Consultant for INPARQUES Own Revenues&#13;
Objective:&#13;
1.    Assist INPARQUES in strengthening its capacity to generate and collect&#13;
own revenues.&#13;
Duration:&#13;
2.    12 months&#13;
Responsibilities and activities:&#13;
3.    The consultant will assist INPARQUES in strengthening its capacity to&#13;
generate and collect own revenues through activities in three areas: (a)&#13;
INPARQUES internal organization for the activities of generating and collecting&#13;
own revenues; (b) studies necessary to support the development of own revenue&#13;
strategies; and (c) programming and execution of activities with the public&#13;
(visitors to National Parks, concessionaires, foundations and public in general).&#13;
4.    The consultant will assist INPARQUES in initiating the own revenue&#13;
strategy included in the Financial Plan agreed with the Bank (Annex 5). This&#13;
would include supporting INPARQUES in the following areas:&#13;
(a)   Proposing and introducing institutional adjustments necessary&#13;
within INPARQUES at the central and regional levels, including&#13;
the creation of incentives for collection of own revenues in the&#13;
National Parks administrations in the Regional Offices to increase&#13;
the rate of revenue collection.&#13;
(b)   Proposing and establishing a permanent program for controlling&#13;
the number of visitors to parks and a system of periodic surveys&#13;
on the socio-economic characteristics and motivations of park&#13;
users.&#13;
(c)   Proposing, preparing and supervising the execution of studies&#13;
necessary to update existing tariffs and introduce new tariffs,&#13;
including the following:&#13;
(1)   Studies related to own revenue capture associated with the&#13;
benefits of watershed protection. On June 5, 1992, the&#13;
Government of Venezuela approved the creation of the&#13;
Investment Fund for Watershed Conservation, to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
ATrACHMBENT 1&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
administered by the Ministry of the Environment and&#13;
Renewable Natural Resources, and which would be&#13;
financed with special tariffs equal to 0.5% of the water&#13;
charges and 1% of the hydroelectric energy charges. An&#13;
approximate calculation suggests that such a fund could&#13;
recover annually about US$8 million.' National Parks and&#13;
Natural Monuments cover approximately 30% of the area&#13;
of upper watersheds and this could serve as an indicative&#13;
and a basis for negotiating the share of revenues that&#13;
INPARQUES should receive from that fund.&#13;
(2)    Studies related to tariff charges for the installation of&#13;
public and private infrastructure and other commercial&#13;
uses inside National Parks. Due to their strategic location,&#13;
many National Parks and Natural Monuments were chosen&#13;
as locations for the infrastructure of radio, TV and other&#13;
telecommunication firms. A partial survey of these&#13;
installations done in 1991 identified 109 private anthenas&#13;
and 43 public anthenas inside 10 National Parks and&#13;
Natural Monuments. Other important users include&#13;
mineral water bottling firms, oil pipelines, electric&#13;
transmission lines and transportation corridors. There are&#13;
relevant experiences in other countries that show there is&#13;
room for generating substantial revenues by charging these&#13;
firms for the rights to install infrastructure, either in&#13;
financial resources or services (e.g. TV time for&#13;
environmental education).&#13;
(3)    Studies to update payments of tourism operators inside or&#13;
around National Parks and Protected Areas.&#13;
INPARQUES already charges tourist operators and&#13;
concessionaires inside national parks and natural&#13;
monuments, but existing tariffs are extremely low and vary&#13;
widely. INPARQUES needs to carry out a detailed study&#13;
of the level of tariffs to charge commercial operators with&#13;
the objective of reducing variability and increase the&#13;
transparency of how these charges are set. The level of&#13;
charges should be set in order for INPARQUES to&#13;
capture a larger proportion of the economic rent being&#13;
generated, part of which are associated with the&#13;
monopolistic or oligopolistic nature of the business. The&#13;
study should also include analyses and proposals for the&#13;
gradual introduction of competitive bidding for the rights&#13;
I      At 1992 prices and data the urban consumption of water is about 70 m3/second, and&#13;
at an average price of 20 Bs./m3 total potentiaL revenues are about 44,150 million Bs.&#13;
wnuaLly. Assuming only 25X of these revenues are coltected, 0.5X of the revenues collected&#13;
are about 55 mitLion Bs. annually. For the estimation of energy a production level of about&#13;
50,000 million kw/hour was assumed. Considering that the energy price to distributors Is&#13;
0.98 Bolivar per kw, revenues amount to about 49,000 miLLions Bs. annually, 1X of which is&#13;
490 million Bs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
ATTACHMENT 1&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
to carry out commercial touristic activities inside parks.&#13;
Finally the study needs to consider how to capture&#13;
economic rent from tourist operators located outside but&#13;
close to parks and which benefit from the park existence.&#13;
(4)   Studies related to visitor's willingness to pay for visits to&#13;
parks.  The infrastructure investments and additional&#13;
services associated with the INPARQUES project will&#13;
improve services to visitors and the capacity to collect&#13;
visitor charges. The Venezuelan public is not used to&#13;
paying for the recreational use of natural resources but&#13;
would more readily accept paying for associated services&#13;
such as improved infrastructure, information, visitor&#13;
activities, guided tours, etc.). This study would survey&#13;
visitors to National Parks (origin, expenditures, income,&#13;
etc.) in order to generate information about willingness to&#13;
pay for specific categories of services and to permit the&#13;
estimation of the optimal levels of charges. This study&#13;
would also provide information necessary for the&#13;
calculation of charges to concessionaires and tourist&#13;
operators.&#13;
(d)   Design and supervise public communications programs to explain&#13;
own revenue policies to the public in general, concessionaires and&#13;
possible donors, including the following:&#13;
(1)   Design of a public campaign to explain to visitors to&#13;
National Parks and Natural Monuments why they need to&#13;
contribute to the maintenance costs of INPARQUES.&#13;
(2)   Design of a fund raising campaign among national and&#13;
international donors. In recent years INPARQUES has&#13;
been relatively successful in obtaining donations from&#13;
Venezuelan and international institutions, including&#13;
Fundaci6n Polar, Petr6leos de Venezuela and affiliates,&#13;
Proctor &amp; Gamble, European Community, private Banks,&#13;
US National Parks Service, Nature Conservancy, Wildlife&#13;
International, Econatura, Terramar, etc. There is&#13;
potential for increasing these sources of revenue and&#13;
INPARQUES needs a strategy for tapping these&#13;
resources.&#13;
5.    The consultant should maintain close communication with the team&#13;
responsible for the study on Costs and Benefits of National Parks in order to (a)&#13;
avoid duplicating activities; and (b) make the best use of the results in the design&#13;
of own revenue policies for INPARQUES.&#13;

Fnancial Management Advisor&#13;
Objective&#13;
1.    To bring about rapid improvement in INPARQUES' financial&#13;
management, as related to cash flow, revolving funds, petty cash (cajas chicas),&#13;
investment of idle money, and similar issues. (There are separate terms of&#13;
reference for consultants in (i) recurrent cost recovery and pricing policy and (ii)&#13;
mobilizing external financing.)&#13;
Duration&#13;
2.    6 months before and/or during Year 1; 3 months each during Years 2-5 of&#13;
the Project.&#13;
Principal problems to be addressed:&#13;
3.    The consult would assist INPARQUES in the solution of the following&#13;
problems:&#13;
(a)   There is excessive centralization of financial management&#13;
functions in the Central office, resulting in (i) significant payment&#13;
delays and (ii) administrative inefficiency;&#13;
(b)   Cash flow in INPARQUES is not smooth; short-term cash deficits&#13;
often arise unnecessarily;&#13;
(c)   Idle money (dinero ocioso)--such as money which has been&#13;
committed but not yet disbursed--often is not earning the best&#13;
possible rate of return for INPARQUES; and&#13;
(d)   Financial management data within INPARQUES is not organized&#13;
in an effective manner, resulting in misunderstandings about how&#13;
much money is available for making specific payments.&#13;

Duties and activities to be performed:&#13;
4.    Working with selected counterpart staff, the consultant should:&#13;
(a)   Implement a new system of financial management at&#13;
INPARQUES' Central, Regional, and Park levels (taking into&#13;
account the ongoing decentralization). To the extent needed, this&#13;
system should be standardized across the Regional offices, to&#13;
facilitate easy processing by the Central office. Among other&#13;
improvements, this new financial management system should:&#13;
(1)   Provide ways to optimize cash flow within INPARQUES;&#13;
and&#13;
(2)   Enable INPARQUES to earn the best possible rate of&#13;
return on its idle funds, consistent with (i) Venezuelan law&#13;
and (ii) the safety of the funds.&#13;
(b)   Organize the data needed for optimum financial management in a&#13;
computerized system which is easy to use and maintain, at the&#13;
Central and each Regional office. Also, provide on-the-job&#13;
training to key INPARQUES staff in (i) how to use the system to&#13;
obtain needed data efficiently and (ii) how to keep the system up-&#13;
to-date; and&#13;
(c)   Recommend specific follow-up training, as needed, for selected&#13;
key staff to enable them to manage INPARQUES funds&#13;
effectively and efficiently.&#13;
Products and outputs expected&#13;
5.    The following outputs are expected during and by the end of the&#13;
consultancy:&#13;
(a)   A new system for financial management at INPARQUES, with&#13;
clear written procedures;&#13;
(b)   A new computerized system for storing and managing financial&#13;
data;&#13;
(c)   A written description of the recommended follow-up training in&#13;
financial management for key INPARQUES staff; and&#13;
(d)   A brief progress report after every 3 months of work (i.e. twice&#13;
before and/or during Year 1 and once during each of Years 2-5).&#13;
Each progress report should indicate (i) the specific recommended&#13;
changes in INPARQUES' financial management system, (ii) the&#13;
extent to which these changes have been implemented, and (iii)&#13;
the extent of observed improvements, such as shorter and fewer&#13;
payment delays, fewer or no short-term financial crises (due to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

cash flow rather than budgetary constraints), and a higher rate of&#13;
return on idle funds. A copy of each progress report should be&#13;
sent to the World Bank, along with the comments of&#13;
INPARQUES' higher-level staff.&#13;
Necary qualifications&#13;
6.    The following qualifications are essential:&#13;
(a)   Substantial prior experience in successfully reforming the financial&#13;
management systems of specific public sector agencies, particularly&#13;
in Latin America;&#13;

Terms of Reference&#13;
Study on Costs and Benefits of the National Park System&#13;
Objective&#13;
1.    To estimate the costs and benefits associated with the existence of&#13;
Venezuela's National Park System.&#13;
Duration&#13;
2.    24 months.&#13;
Composition of the study team&#13;
3.    The research could be undertaken by an individual or by a research&#13;
institution's team. Because it would require undertaking surveys and data&#13;
gathering activities, it could be worked out in a continuous or several non&#13;
continuous periods (for example to account for the time where the surveys&#13;
are performed by INPARQUES staff or a third party)&#13;
Rationale&#13;
1.    Development projects are evaluated in terms of Cost-Benefit Analysis&#13;
(CBA). CBA requires (a) estimating the streams of all costs and benefits&#13;
stemming from the development project throughout its life, and (b)&#13;
calculating the net present value or the internal rate of return of that streamn&#13;
of benefits and costs.&#13;
2.    The use of CRA has been limited in projects associated with National&#13;
Parks (NPs). When non-market situations such as externalities,&#13;
irreversibilities or uniqueness are present, costs and particularly benefits are&#13;
difficult to estimate. All these conditions occur in conservation projects and&#13;
particularly in National Parks' development projects. Nevertheless during&#13;
recent years significant attention has been devoted to expanding economic&#13;
analysis to cover National Parks projects. Progress has been achieved in two&#13;
directions (a) identifying the range of costs and benefits involved; and (b)&#13;
estimating figures for a limited subset of costs and benefits which are more&#13;
amenable to CBA. Even a partial estimation of costs and benefits of NPs can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
ATTACHMENT 3&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
give decision-makers a better understanding of the range of issue involved in&#13;
conservation, and in particular can help to:&#13;
(a)   Identify NPs beneficiaries that could contribute to the costs of&#13;
operating the NPs.&#13;
(b)   Define the levels of fees and contributions that can be charged&#13;
for the NPs services.&#13;
(c)   Increase the visibility of the many NPs benefits accruing to&#13;
society from its investment in support of the NPs, therefore&#13;
enabling National Parks Administrations to compete for scarce&#13;
budgetary resources on more fair terms.&#13;
(d)   Spot new information needs and help to devise new technical&#13;
approaches to economic evaluation of conservation projects.&#13;
Study background and design&#13;
3.    There is an increasing body of literature on the economic evaluation&#13;
of biodiversity conservation. Also considerable progress has been made in&#13;
the use of contingent valuation of non marketable goods, and travel costs&#13;
surveys to measure recreational benefits. As part of the preparation of the&#13;
INPARQUES project, consultants made some rough estimations of the&#13;
economic benefits of Venezuela's NPs. They showed that economic benefits&#13;
stemming from watershed protection -- for agriculture, hydropower and&#13;
urban water supply -- were very high. There were also firm presumptions&#13;
of high tourism benefits, but the lack of information precluded their&#13;
estimation.&#13;
4.    The proposed study should make use of the above mentioned and&#13;
other relevant studies to assess to the extent possible the economic costs and&#13;
benefits of the Venezuela's National Park's System, including estimations of:&#13;
(a)   Costs, including direct, indirect and opportunity costs&#13;
(b)   Benefits, including benefits form marketable products, non&#13;
marketable products, recreation and tourism, watershed&#13;
protection, biodiversity protection and biodiversity&#13;
commercialization potential, greenhouse gases sequestration,&#13;
ecological process protection, education, research, non-&#13;
consumptive benefits and option, quasi-option, existence and&#13;
bequest values.&#13;
5.    Because currently available information is scarce, the present study&#13;
should not be limited to an exercise of analyzing the existing data. On the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
ATTACHMENT 3&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
contrary it is expected that the study will design and undertake activities in&#13;
relation to:&#13;
(a)   Surveys of visitors to NPs to gather the information required&#13;
to estimate the economic benefits of recreation and tourism.&#13;
(b)   Collection and analysis of information on economic activities&#13;
in NPs necessary to estimate the benefits of marketable and&#13;
non marketable products not related to tourism and recreation.&#13;
(c)   Collection and analysis of information required to estimate the&#13;
benefits of watershed protection.&#13;
(d)   Collection of information and performance of surveys as&#13;
necessary to estimate external benefits of Venezuela's&#13;
biodiversity conservation.&#13;
(e)   Collection and analysis of the information required to estimate&#13;
benefits of greenhouse gasses sequestration.&#13;
6.    While the contractor will be responsible for the design of the above&#13;
mentioned studies and the analysis of their outcome, part of them should be&#13;
performed with the help of INPARQUES staff (parks and visitors surveys) to&#13;
the extent possible.&#13;
7.    A key objective of this study is to provide meaningful inputs to&#13;
INPARQUES own revenues strategy. Therefore the research team will&#13;
engage in early discussions with the INPARQUES own revenue staff and the&#13;
consultant on own revenues, in relation to the design and the presentation of&#13;
the study outcome.&#13;
Expected outputs&#13;
8.    The outputs should include:&#13;
(a)   A document presenting the study results. A specific section of&#13;
the document should address the issue of how to use the results&#13;
of this study in INPARQUES own revenue strategy in relation&#13;
to different type of conservation benieficiaries, both national&#13;
and international.&#13;
(b)   A short seminar directed to INPARQUES staff on how to use&#13;
and how to update the study results.&#13;
(c)   A policy brief to government listing the policy implications of&#13;
the study.&#13;

VENEZUELA&#13;
INPARQUES PROJECI&#13;
INPARQUES Fnancial Plan&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The protected areas under INPARQUES management contribute many&#13;
environmental services to the national economy. The more tangible benefits are&#13;
the protection of watersheds, the protection of urban water supplies, the supply&#13;
of quality water to irrigated agriculture, and the maintenance of ecological&#13;
processes in coastal marine ecosystems. Moreover, protected areas provide many&#13;
recreational opportunities to national and foreign tourists alike. Internationally,&#13;
Venezuelan protected areas are an important carbon sink and a repository of&#13;
threatened animal and plant species. Estimating the economic value of these&#13;
services is a difficult task. Data and information on physical relationships&#13;
between levels of protection and provision of environmental services is scant and&#13;
the valuation of some environmental benefits is not widely accepted yet.&#13;
Nevertheless analysis carried out during project preparation estimated that the&#13;
contribution of INPARQUES protected areas to the water cycle and coastal&#13;
marine ecosystems alone could range from over US$185 million to about US$461&#13;
million'.&#13;
2.    Today very little of the economic value of protected areas is captured by&#13;
INPARQUES. Through a variety of charges and fees in 1994 INPARQUES&#13;
generated revenues of about US$1.63 million. In addition to this self-generated&#13;
revenue, in 1994 it received a Government budget of about US$8.64 million.&#13;
INPARQUES total revenues therefore amounted to about US$10.27 million.&#13;
This is a mere 33% to 56% of the economic value generated by protected areas&#13;
in 1994, even if one accounts only for the benefits of improved water supply and&#13;
coastal ecosystems, underestimates recreational and ignores biodiversity and&#13;
carbon sink values.&#13;
3.    One might think that as long as the activities of INPARQUES are&#13;
adequately supported by the Government budget there is no reason for it to&#13;
attempt to further capture some of the economic value of protected areas.&#13;
There are, however, three important economic reasons for INPARQUES to&#13;
follow a policy of capturing an increased share of the economic value of the&#13;
areas it protects, hence reducing its dependence on the government budget.&#13;
First, by making economic agents, both public and private, pay for the&#13;
environmental services generated by protected areas, these services would be&#13;
1 Present value at a 10% discount rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;

better internalized in public and private decision making and there would be&#13;
gains in economic efficiency because market prices would reflect better the value&#13;
of these protected areas. Although environmental charges are a widely accepted&#13;
premise, whether an agency like INPARQUES should have responsibility for&#13;
collecting these charges is a different issue. However, at this time INPARQUES&#13;
is better positioned than any other agency to set and supervise the levels of fees&#13;
and charges that are specific to the sites under INPARQUES management. One&#13;
exception discussed later is the Watershed Protection Charge, which is not site&#13;
specific and thus could be better collected by a different agency with jurisdiction&#13;
over the entire territory.&#13;
4.    Second, by capturing and managing an increased share of the economic&#13;
value of protected areas, the financial sustainability of the programs of&#13;
INPARQUES will be better secured and the agency will be protected from the&#13;
uncertainties of budget allocations. Budget allocations reflect many short-term&#13;
and political priorities, and often fail to internalize adequately the importance of&#13;
environmental services.&#13;
5.    Third, increasing INPARQUES' own revenues is critical to ensure the&#13;
sustainability of the project in the years following project implementation.&#13;
Unless INPARQUES' own revenues expand, the government budget allocation&#13;
to INPARQUES will have to increase substantially to allow it to meet the&#13;
increased recurrent costs attributable to the project, which are estimated at about&#13;
US$6.8 million per year, an increase of about 82% over INPARQUES' recurrent&#13;
costs in 1994. Because it would not be fiscally prudent for INPARQUES to&#13;
assume ever greater Government budget transfers, INPARQUES should find&#13;
additional revenue sources to effectively maintain the infrastructure installed by&#13;
the project.&#13;
6.    INPARQUES already has the legal status that permits it to set, charge,&#13;
collect and manage its own revenues from sites under its management. As an&#13;
autonomous institute, INPARQUES has responsibility over the financial&#13;
management of its revenues, which are deposited in a bank account under&#13;
INPARQUES and do not revert back to the Treasury. Only charges extending&#13;
beyond the sites under its jurisdiction require government or Congressional&#13;
approval. This is the case with the Watershed Protection Charge. Because the&#13;
agency manages its own revenues, there are clear incentives in the system for it&#13;
to collect revenues efficiently and to maximize the level of revenues collected.&#13;
7.    INPARQUES is much further ahead than similar agencies in most LAC&#13;
countries in its capacity to generate and manage own revenues and its recent&#13;
performance in generating revenues from own sources is particularly promising.&#13;
The agency has made positive strides towards self-sufficiency: although own&#13;
revenues amounted to a mere 7% of total revenues in 1990, they had already&#13;
increased to 16% of total revenues by 1994. (Attachment 1). While the&#13;
government budget allocated to INPARQUES declined at an average annual rate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
of 4.9% per annum in nominal dollars from 1990 through 1994, own revenues&#13;
increased at 18.8% per annum during the same period.&#13;
8.    Performance in 1994 is a cause for concern, though. The INPARQUES&#13;
budget allocation from the government declined from a peak of US$15.8 million&#13;
in 1992 to only US$8.64 million in 1994. INPARQUES own revenues, that had&#13;
been increasing sharply until 1993, also declined in 1994. Part of this declines&#13;
was due to the devaluation of the Bolivar from 83 to the dollar in 1993 to 170 to&#13;
the dollar in 1994 (general inflation levels during this period were 46% in 1993&#13;
and 71% in 1994) and INPARQUES's limited ability, in the short term, to adjust&#13;
its fees and charges. During the same period the administration of&#13;
INPARQUES changed twice, interrupting the continuity of programs and&#13;
policies. INPARQUES is now trying to catch up with inflation, but the&#13;
Directorate in charge of own revenues is still in its infancy and lacks the&#13;
resources to respond quickly to inflation. This project includes strengthening of&#13;
that Directorate so that the steep decline in own revenues observed in 1994&#13;
would not be repeated in the future. Moreover, the project would require&#13;
INPARQUES to maintain continuity in its revenue generation and institutional&#13;
reform activities, thus ensuring that key policies are maintained even with&#13;
changing administrations.&#13;
INPARQUES Financial Plan&#13;
9.    To address the issues of charging for environmental services, gaining&#13;
more financial independence from budgetary allocations, and ensuring project&#13;
sustainability, INPARQUES has prepared a Financial Plan (Tables 5.1, 5.2 and&#13;
5.3), which the project would help to implement. The main element of the&#13;
Financial Plan is an aggressive policy of increasing own revenues in order to&#13;
increase independence from the government budget and ensure the sustainability&#13;
of the project. The Financial Plan also identifies the additional budget&#13;
allocations to INPARQUES that are necessary in order for the agency to meet&#13;
its counterpart commitments.&#13;
10.   Own revenue sources. INPARQUES proposal defines eight categories of&#13;
own revenues. The total long-term revenue generation potential of these&#13;
categories is roughly estimated to be around US$15.7 million dollars annually.&#13;
According to the INPARQUES financial plan, by the year 2005 INPARQUES&#13;
would be collecting about 78% of these potential revenues. The own revenue&#13;
categories that already exist are the following (estimates of the maximum revenue&#13;
potential are given in parentheses):&#13;
(1)   ENTRANCE FEES: increasing or introducing entrance and&#13;
parking fees for visitors and users of National Parks, Urban Parks,&#13;
Zoological Parks and other protected areas under its&#13;
administration. (US$3.5 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
(2)   CONCESSIONS: increasing the charges or introducing&#13;
competitive bidding for commercial rights to develop and/or use&#13;
infrastructure in protected areas, including coffee shops,&#13;
restaurants, marinas, hotels, inns, cabins, boat operations, tourism&#13;
operations, etc. (US$2 million).&#13;
(3)   LICENSES AND PERMITS: increasing or introducing new fees&#13;
for the commercial use of protected areas not involving&#13;
infrastructure, such as rentals of boats and beach chairs, food and&#13;
handicraft vendors, etc. (US$0.5 million).&#13;
(4)   COMMERCIAL USE OF MINERAL WATERS: increasing the&#13;
charges or introducing competitive bidding for the rights to the&#13;
commercial exploitation of mineral waters originating in protected&#13;
areas. (US$0.1 million).&#13;
(5)   WATERSHED PROTECTION: charging the main users of&#13;
water generated in watersheds within protected areas, such as&#13;
urban water systems, irrigation systems and hydroelectric plants.&#13;
(US$8 million).&#13;
(6)   COMMERCIAL FILMS AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF&#13;
NATURAL LANDSCAPES: increasing or introducing fees for&#13;
the rights to film or photograph landscapes, animals and plants&#13;
within protected areas for commercial purposes. (US$0.1 million).&#13;
(7)   INDEMNMTIES FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IN PROTECTED&#13;
AREAS: increasing or introducing new charges for public or&#13;
private infrastructure established inside protected areas, such as&#13;
towers, cabins and cables of electricity utilities, radio and TV&#13;
companies and telecommunications companies. (US$1 million).&#13;
(8)   NATIONAL DONATIONS: donations of the private firms,&#13;
foundations and consumers for the protection and management of&#13;
national and urban parks. (US$0.5 million).&#13;
11.   Moreover the project would provide technical assistance to INPARQUES&#13;
to study and design other alternatives for increasing own revenues and bringing a&#13;
better balance between the benefits of protected areas and the price users should&#13;
pay for their protection. These additional sources of revenues would include&#13;
among others:&#13;
(9)   INDEMNITIES FOR ROADS AND VEHICLES: damage&#13;
related charges for roads and or vehicles that cross protected&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 5 of 9&#13;
(10)  PHARMACEUTICAL VALUES: charges for the rights to&#13;
pharmaceutical samples within protected areas.&#13;
(11)  TOURISM SERVICES CHARGES: charges to hotels and other&#13;
tourist installations that, although outside of protected areas,&#13;
benefit directly from their existence.&#13;
(12)  PENALTIES AND FINES: increased use of fines and penalties&#13;
for the violation of protected areas regulations.&#13;
(13)  CARBON SEQUESTRATION: offset deals for carbon&#13;
sequestration.&#13;
(14) GUARANTEE BONDS FOR RESEARCH IN PROTECTED&#13;
AREAS: although the main purpose of such bonds, to be&#13;
deposited by research institutions, would be to guarantee that the&#13;
research results would be made available to INPARQUES, they&#13;
would be collected by INPARQUES in case of non-performance,&#13;
thus adding to its revenues.&#13;
(15)  TRANSFER OF INTERNATIONAL FUNDS FOR&#13;
BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION: transfer of funds from&#13;
international sources for biodiversity protection; INPARQUES is&#13;
already capturing some of these funds, although at a level much&#13;
below their potential.&#13;
(16)  POLLUTION CHARGES: introducing charges associated with&#13;
levels of pollution threatening protected areas. The most&#13;
notorious examples are in marine national parks such as Mochima&#13;
and Morrocoy. These areas are affected by cement plants, power&#13;
plants and urban sewage.&#13;
12.   In 1994 about 75% of own revenues came from entrance and parking&#13;
fees and concessions, 3% were indemnity charges for infrastructure installed&#13;
inside protected areas and 20% were international donations for biodiversity.&#13;
INPARQUES goal is to increase the share of own revenues in its total budget&#13;
from about 16% in 1994 to about 30% by the year 2000 and 50% by the year&#13;
2005. This amounts to an average growth rate in real terms of 15% from 1994 to&#13;
2000, and of 17% from 2000 to 2005. A faster growth rate during the first years&#13;
of the project is unlikely because INPARQUES needs the project-supported&#13;
infrastructure before it can raise fees and increase the collection rate. Moreover,&#13;
rather than increasing fees drastically to the level that maximizes INPARQUES&#13;
revenues, the agency proposes a cautionary approach of increasing fees gradually.&#13;
This is necessary because of a lack of tradition of consumers in paying for these&#13;
environmental related fees. Current entrance fees in most parks are less than&#13;
US$0.10 per person, far below the willingness to pay for visits to the parks, which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 6 of 9&#13;
anecdotally are put at US$1 or US$2 per person for local visitors, and&#13;
considerably higher for international visitors to Venezuela's most important&#13;
parks.&#13;
13.   The specific initiatives INPARQUES plans to undertake during the life&#13;
of the project to raise its own revenues are listed in the cronogram of Table 5.1.&#13;
The initiatives proposed by INPARQUES are plausible and the own revenue&#13;
targets of INPARQUES for the project period are feasible resulting in an annual&#13;
growth rate of 15% in own revenues, somewhat lower than the historical growth&#13;
rate of 18.8%. The most controversial proposal is the Watershed Protection&#13;
Charge, that, although charged to large utilities, would be passed on to&#13;
consumers. Although this tariff has been approved by the Executive branch, it is&#13;
not yet being implemented due to the political sensitivity of the matter. This&#13;
issue will be further analyzed during the course of the project. The watershed&#13;
protection tariff would be a very small proportion of the costs of water or&#13;
electricity, and if utilities are able to absorb part of the incremental costs the&#13;
impacts on consumers may be negligible. Although this charge would not be&#13;
collected by INPARQUES, it could be targeted to budget allocations to&#13;
INPARQUES, on a basis proportional to the area of Venezuelan watersheds&#13;
under INPARQUES management, which is estimated at about 30%.&#13;

14.    As part of the Decentralization and Administrative Reform Plan&#13;
[NPARQUES created a Directorate General of Own Revenues to lead&#13;
INPARQUES activities in this area, and there is a strong commitment from the&#13;
current INPARQUES administration to give this matter the highest priority.&#13;
During implementation the success of INPARQUES in implementing the&#13;
initiatives listed in the cronogram of Table 5.1 and achieving the target revenues&#13;
of Table 5.2 would be closely monitored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 8 of 9&#13;
15.   Government budget allocations. Even with this effort in generating own&#13;
revenues, INPARQUES would not be in a position to meet its counterpart&#13;
funding commitments without jeopardizing its other programs under way.&#13;
Attachment 2 assumes that INPARQLTES budget allocations for 1995 to 2000, in&#13;
the absence of the project, would equal the levels of 1991 and 1992 in real terms&#13;
(the baseline budget), thus reverting the declining trend of the past two years.&#13;
The question posed is whether, with the project, this baseline budget plus own&#13;
revenues would be sufficient to meet the project's counterpart funding&#13;
commitments. Unfortunately, the answer is no. There is a financing gap.&#13;
16.   Financing gap. There are three main alternatives for covering the&#13;
financing gap created by the project (Attachment 2). The first alternative (Base&#13;
case scenario), which is the one preferred by Government, would be for the&#13;
government to increase budget allocations to INPARQUES. Additional budget&#13;
allocations to meet counterpart funding commitments are necessary for the years&#13;
1996 through 1999 with a peak of about US$6 million in 1996 and 1997, or 43%&#13;
of the 1995 expected budget allocations (Attachment 2). There is one very&#13;
strong reason why Government assigns high priority to these increased budgets&#13;
during the life of the project. Most of the investments of the project have the&#13;
objective and are designed to enhance the capacity of INPARQUES to generate&#13;
its own revenues and approach financial self-sufficiency. From a strictly financial&#13;
point of view, these increased budget allocations in the short term of a maximum&#13;
of US$6 and 4 million in 1997 and 1998 would result in budget savings on the&#13;
order US$2.5 million by the year 2000 and US$8.4 million by 2005. The financial&#13;
rate of return from the government budget point of view is 22% and the net&#13;
present value of the additional budget allocations is US$32 million at a 10%&#13;
discount rate.&#13;
17.   What if the Government is unable to provide INPARQUES with&#13;
additional budget to meet the project counterpart funding requirements? Then&#13;
INPARQUES would have three alternative options for covering the financing&#13;
gap therefore meeting the counterpart commitments to the project. Option A, as&#13;
opposed to Base case scenario described above, would be for INPARQUES to&#13;
divert funds from the investment program in non-project parks to the project,&#13;
plus a small portion of its recurrent costs that are associated with that investment&#13;
program. Under this option the government's additional contribution would&#13;
decline to about US$3 million dollars in 1996 and 1997 and to less than that in&#13;
1998. No additional budget would be needed for the other years. The trade-off&#13;
under this option would be that investments in parks excluded from the project&#13;
would stop between 1996 and 1998. Although unfortunate this trade-off may not&#13;
be very costly, since the parks excluded from the project are precisely those&#13;
considered to be lowest priority.&#13;
18.   The second alternative to the base case scenario, Option B, would be for&#13;
INPARQUES to meet all the counterpart commitments without resorting to&#13;
additional government budget. These would have to be met by reallocating the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 9 of 9&#13;
normal investment program to the project, as in option B, and by increasing own&#13;
revenues. This option would require increasing own revenues to US$6.4 million&#13;
as early as 1996, double what INPARQUES has projected for that year. In other&#13;
words this would imply advancing by about 4 years the own revenue program.&#13;
19.   Role of the project. The project would help INPARQUES achieve&#13;
project sustainability through a variety of actions designed to enhance its capacity&#13;
to set, collect and manage its own revenues. Specifically the project would:&#13;
(1)   TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: provide technical assistance in (a)&#13;
financial management; (b) accounting; (c) procurement of goods&#13;
and services; (d) setting and collecting fees and charges; and (e)&#13;
economic valuation of protected areas.&#13;
(2)   INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING: (a) support the recently&#13;
created Directorate of Own Revenues; (b) enhance the capacity&#13;
of the Directorate of Own Revenues to capture an increased&#13;
volume of international transfers for protected areas; (c) enhance&#13;
the capacity of the Directorate of Own Revenues to capture&#13;
increasing private sector and NGO contributions; (d) enhance the&#13;
capacity of Regional Offices to manage their own revenue&#13;
programs; (e) decentralize financial management to give incentives&#13;
to regional offices to collect revenues more efficiently;&#13;
(3)   INFRASTRUCTURE: establishment of infrastructure that would&#13;
provide increased services to park users and facilitate collection&#13;
and control of fees and charges.&#13;
(4)   ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION: educate park users and the&#13;
population in general on the economic value of protected areas&#13;
and the need to support them thus facilitating acceptance of new&#13;
or higher fees and charges.&#13;
(5)   ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH: conduct research on the&#13;
physical and biological processes inside protected areas and/or on&#13;
the economic value of the associated environmental services to&#13;
permit a better identification of beneficiaries from protection and&#13;
a better targeting of fees and charges.&#13;

Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
1.    Systematic and accurate reporting of project performance would be essential given the&#13;
scope of proposed project activities, and the agencies responsible for implementation. Active&#13;
monitoring would be crucial, taking into account the innovative nature of the project and the&#13;
need for adjusting to possible changing circumstances during implementation in accordance with&#13;
overall project objectives as described and agreed upon during appraisal.&#13;
2.    The executing agency, INPARQUES, will be responsible for the preparation of quarterly&#13;
reports, based, in part, on information provided by the cooperating agencies (PROFAUNA,&#13;
SADA-AMAZONAS and FAC) on their respective subcomponents. The Project Coordinating&#13;
Unit (PCU) will be in charge of coordinating project documentation and forwarding the&#13;
consolidated report to the Bank within 30 days of the end of the quarter.&#13;
3.    The quarterly reports will focus on the evaluation of progress against the annual operating&#13;
plans, measures of project performance and impact, and other issues related to project&#13;
implementation and management. They are designed to be used by the senior management of&#13;
INPARQUES, the Ministry of Environment, other agencies of Government, and the World Bank&#13;
as an effective tool for project monitoring and would include the following sections:&#13;
(a)   The Summary of Project Implementation would give a general description of&#13;
project implementation during the period under review, by component, including&#13;
the project's overall status, adherence to the Annual Operating Plan and&#13;
development impact to date. In addition, this section should comment on the&#13;
effectiveness of project coordination among project agencies and on project&#13;
administration issues, including fund flows/Government budgeting, disbursements,&#13;
procurement, accounts and audits and technical assistance. The status of actions&#13;
proposed and issues unresolved from the previous quarterly report, and actions&#13;
proposed for the following period, would also be included.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Inparques Project
            is to strengthen the capability of the Government to manage
            Venezuela's national and urban parks, natural
            monuments, and wildlife refuges and reserves. In particular,
            the project will: strengthen conservation and protection of
            the vulnerable areas; intensify public environmental
            research, training and education efforts; and improve the
            economic sustainability of national parks and other
            protected areas. The main project components are: 1)
            management and protection of 16 parks in northern Venezuela,
            four national parks and two groups of natural monuments in
            the Amazon region, two wildlife refuges and seven urban
            recreational parks, and establishment of an effective fire
            prevention and fire fighting capacity throughout the
            national park system; 2) Applied environmental research to
            support sustainable management of various[arls and generate
            useful scientific knowledge on the ecology of the parks, and
            assist Venezuela in safeguarding its rights with respect to
            research findings and the possible commercial use of its
            biodiversity resources; 3) environmental education both at
            the regional and local levels, to disseminate information,
            raise the level of knowledge about environmental issues and
            their linkages with economic development, and engage the
            active participation of the community in supporting
            environmental protection; and 4) institutional development,
            including training, technical assistance and studies,
            physical physical infrastructure, equipment, furniture and
            other operational support for institutions engaged in the
            implementation of the project.
