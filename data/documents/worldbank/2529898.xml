            "It was the best of times, it was
            the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age
            of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch
            of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the
            season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the
            winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had
            nothing before us . . ." Quoting the opening of Charles
            Dickens's Tale of Two Cities in connection with the
            current state of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry
            may, if anything, be overly optimistic, beset as the
            industry is with low prices and stuttering demand in its
            Asian stronghold. But it is hard to resist calling on these
            contrasts to characterize the LNG industry, for despite its
            problems, there are glimmerings of change that could
            profoundly improve its lot. LNG is essentially a niche fuel.
            Liquefying and shipping gas is expensive, so the LNG route
            is attractive for developers only where there is no local
            market or where capacity in the local market is insufficient
            to take all the available local supplies. LNG requires large
            investments by the buyers in terminal and regasification
            facilities, so it generally flourishes only where there is a
            shortage of indigenous gas supplies and where competition
            from pipeline gas is limited. In bulk, LNG is suitable for
            transport only by sea, so its use in landlocked areas is
            confined to small peak shaving plants or isolated locations
            such as central Australia.
