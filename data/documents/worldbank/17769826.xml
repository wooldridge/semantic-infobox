&amp;#12;               How Private Sector Involvement can Help the Poor:&#13;
               Lessons from Manila (East)&#13;
                                       Contrary to popular belief, the private sector is     also available in some areas. Community workers,&#13;

                                 from where families who wanted a private connection         have been met with better service, lower bills and&#13;
                                 could install and run a rubber piping connection to         improved health, while private sector expertise and&#13;

    GUIDELINES FOR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION&#13;
    IN URBAN WATER AND SANITATION SERVICES&#13;
    The Manesar Workshop was the launch pad for the MoUD &amp; PAâ&#128;&#153;s initiative to formulate guidelines,&#13;
    which will act as a useful tool for those Municipalities and States who are serious about reform, to&#13;
    design a program which suits their situation, is attractive to private partners and, most crucially,&#13;
    improves the state of water supply and sanitation services in India, for all consumers, but especially&#13;
    for that most neglected group, the urban poor.&#13;
         As a follow-up to the workshop, the Ministry held formal consultations in February 2002, to&#13;
    decide on the structure and key issues to be covered by the guidelines; and in June to solicit&#13;
    feedback on key recommendations contained in the draft guidelines. These consultations were&#13;
    attended by State and city officials responsible for urban and water sectors, service providers,&#13;
                                                                                                                 For more information, contact:&#13;

    Provision of water supply and sanitation (WSS) usually takes place in a localized monopoly market&#13;
    structure due to the network nature of infrastructure, although the private service provider is selected&#13;
    through a process of competitive bidding. However, international experiences of PSP clearly indicate&#13;
    that there is a wide range of arrangements for public-private responsibilities, as well as market and&#13;
    regulatory structures. The UK has a system of regional companies, which are in effect monopolies&#13;
    within their jurisdictions; Australia and France adopt a mixed approach with both regional and&#13;
    city-level monopolies; Adelaide, Johannesburg and Gdansk have city-level monopolies; and&#13;
    Papakura and Manila have sub-city monopolies. There is a clear link between diverse market&#13;
    structures and counterpart regulatory systems. The UK has a single regulator for the entire country;&#13;
    France has a decentralized system with municipalities regulating via individual contracts, but there&#13;
    is a proposal to appoint a national regulator operating in an advisory capacity; Manila and&#13;
    Johannesburg have a decentralized system with an exclusive regulator responsible for each city.&#13;
    Figure 1 depicts the range of market structures and regulatory regimes described above. The&#13;
    greater the number of localized monopolies, the greater the possibility of adding benchmarking as&#13;
    an additional instrument of regulation.&#13;

     â&#128;¢ Structural and economic reforms, along with independent regulation, are pre-conditions for&#13;
       PSP . However, if services are to improve, some of these reforms must be introduced with or&#13;
       without a PSP initiative.&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Independent regulation is no substitute for comprehensive reforms.&#13;
     â&#128;¢ The political will for reform must be translated into enabling legislation, pre-PSP restructuring,&#13;

              SUPPORTING THE TRANSITION TO&#13;
              CREDITWORTHY AND SUSTAINABLE CITIES&#13;
              Responding to the urban challenge, and in the context of the 74th Constitutional&#13;
              Amendment, MoUD &amp; PA has introduced a new fiscal instrument, the City Challenge Fund&#13;
              (CCF). Announced in the Budget speech of the Finance Minister for 2002-03, the CCF will be&#13;
              set up as an incentive-based grant to support cities to fund the transition cost of moving&#13;
              towards sustainable and creditworthy institutional systems of municipal governance,&#13;
              management and service delivery.&#13;
                  It is expected that the CCF grant will be provided on a competitive basis to cities as budgetary&#13;
              support for institutional change, not on a project basis, and will be payable in tranches against&#13;
              clearly defined performance benchmarks embodied in a well-defined restructuring plan. The Ministry&#13;
              has contracted a team to design the CCF in detail.&#13;
                  Water distribution and sewerage services are key urban services eligible under the CCF as long&#13;
              as the criteria of institutional reform, including options for PSP, is the focus of the proposal.&#13;

            India's economic growth and levels
            of poverty are increasingly being determined by the
            productivity of its towns and cities. This potential of the
            urban sector to contribute to national welfare requires,
            among other factors, adequate infrastructure services for
            generating economic growth and reducing poverty. Current
            public institutions do not have the financial and human
            resources to bridge the infrastructure gap and meet this
            challenge. It has therefore become necessary to involve the
            private sector in service provision. The water and
            sanitation sector has not been immune from the daunting
            challenges of service delivery facing the urban sector in
            general. Cities in India do not supply water twenty four
            hours a day, seven days a week; the poor are often excluded
            from formal service provision; and we have not broken the
            cycle of water-borne health problems. The urban water sector
            needs urgent attention and here, too, the role of the
            private sector needs to be explored. This report is part of
            such an overall process to support our efforts. The focus
            will be on the urban water sector and ways that Private
            Sector Participation (PSP) arrangements can contribute to
            making the sector more efficient while serving the poor.
