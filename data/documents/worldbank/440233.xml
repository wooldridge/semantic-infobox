Social Marketing Strategies&#13;

Abstract&#13;
It is widely accepted that one of the most critical elements of a country's anti-corruption program is the&#13;
involvement of civil society but there is less agreement on how such involvement can be encouraged.&#13;
Social marketing can make an important contribution to the creation of an atmosphere in public life&#13;
that discourages fraud and corruption. Drawing on lessons from the use of social marketing in public&#13;
health campaigns (e.g., to reduce smoking and alcoholism, to encourage safe sex and to encourage&#13;
physical fitness), environmental campaigns (e.g., to promote recycling), education campaigns (to en-&#13;
courage literacy) and the protection of individual/group rights (e.g., racial and gender equality, gay and&#13;
lesbian rights) this paper argues that social marketing can also make an important contribution to the&#13;
creation of an atmosphere in public life that discourages fraud and corruption. It can do so by: raising&#13;
awareness about the costs of corruption to a country; mainstreaming a concern about corruption within&#13;
national institutions, increasing the understanding of causal factors of corruption amongst the public&#13;
and influencing behavior.&#13;

Corruption is a problem that all countries have to confront. Solutions, however, can only&#13;
be home-grown. National leaders need to take a stand. Civil society plays a key role as well.&#13;
Working with our partners, the Bank Group will help any of our member countries to imple-&#13;
ment national programs that discourage corrupt practices. And we will support international ef-&#13;
forts to fight corruption and to establish voluntary standards of behavior for corporations and&#13;
investors in the industrialized world.&#13;
The Bank Group cannot intervene in the political affairs of our member countries. But we&#13;
can give advice, encouragement, and support to governments that wish to fight corruption-and&#13;
it is these governments that will, over time, attract the larger volume of investment. Let me em-&#13;
phasize that the Bank Group will not tolerate corruption in the programs that we support; and&#13;
we are taking steps to ensure that our own activities continue to meet the highest standards of&#13;
probity.&#13;

The World Bank has long-advocated appro-&#13;
priate economic and administrative policies as&#13;
part of their policy dialogue with client coun-&#13;
tries. In addition, EDI has assisted countries in&#13;
the design and implementation of anti-corrup-&#13;
tion programs; to date, such assistance has fo-&#13;
cused on action planning through National In-&#13;
tegrity Workshops, awareness raising through&#13;
media training and working with such institu-&#13;
tions as Parliament, Supreme Audit Institutions&#13;
and the Judiciary. In terms of raising public&#13;
awareness and strengthening civic institutions&#13;
through social marketing, the involvement of&#13;
EDI as advisor, educator and, in some cases,&#13;
partner in social marketing design and execu-&#13;
tion could be appropriate. In this regard, the&#13;
authors are developing a pilot "Social Market-&#13;
ing Strategies for Curbing Corruption" work-&#13;
shop which will be included in EDI's portfolio&#13;
of "products." In addition, a substantial contri-&#13;
bution that the World Bank could make is to de-&#13;
velop a body of knowledge and experiences in&#13;
awareness raising and civic institutional strength-&#13;
ening and make them available to countries that&#13;
developing anti-corruption programs. In addition,&#13;
greater awareness raising through training in so-&#13;

paigns would stimulate interest within countries&#13;
to explore the merits of a corruption interven-&#13;

The most appropriate channel mix will also&#13;
depend on the sociopolitical environment of the&#13;
country. In some instances, the intervention pro-&#13;
gram might prove more successful by first convinc-&#13;

(push strategy). In other instances, the program&#13;
might first have to influence the general public to&#13;
support and demand action from policymakers&#13;
(pull strategy).&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            It is widely accepted that one of the
            most critical elements of a country's anti-corruption
            program is the involvement of civil society but there is
            less agreement on how such involvement can be encouraged.
            Social marketing can make an important contribution to the
            creation of an atmosphere in public life that discourages
            fraud and corruption. Drawing on lessons from the use of
            social marketing in public health campaigns (e.g., to reduce
            smoking and alcoholism, to encourage safe sex and to
            encourage physical fitness), environmental campaigns (e.g.,
            to promote recycling), education campaigns (to encourage
            literacy), and the protection of individual/group rights
            (e.g., racial and gender equality, gay and lesbian rights),
            this paper argues that social marketing can also make an
            important contribution to the creation of an atmosphere in
            public life that discourages fraud and corruption. It can do
            so by: raising awareness about the costs of corruption to a
            country; mainstreaming a concern about corruption within
            national institutions; and increasing the understanding of
            causal factors of corruption amongst the public and
            influencing behavior.
