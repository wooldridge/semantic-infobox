            Regulatory reform - institution building:
            lessons from Mexico
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            During the 1990s Mexico undertook some
            of the world's most far-reaching reforms of business
            regulations. Many factors, including trade liberalization
            and firm political commitment, drove this process. But
            critical to its sustained success was the early development
            and then legal strengthening of a regulatory reform agency
            dedicated to pursuing consumer welfare and ensuring public
            scrutiny of regulations. This Note documents the
            agency's role in creating an environment for improved
            business regulation and greater transparency.
