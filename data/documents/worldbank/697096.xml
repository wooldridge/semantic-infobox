Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:                Republic of Paraguay&#13;
Implementing Agency:    Ministry of Education and Culture (MEG)&#13;
Poverty:                  Not applicable&#13;
Amount:                  US$24.5 million equivalent&#13;
Terms:                    Fixed rate US dollar single currency loan for up to 15 years at the&#13;
standard LIBOR-based interest rate. Each semester's aggregate&#13;
disbursements (Disbursed Amount) will have a grace period of&#13;
three years and a final maturity of nine years from the rate fixing&#13;
date of that Disbursed Amount. The interest payment dates and&#13;
rate fixing dates are June 15 and December 15, respectively.&#13;
Commitment Fee:           0.75% on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60&#13;
days after signing, less any waiver&#13;
Financing Plan:           See Schedule A&#13;
Net Present Value:       Calculation of a net present value for this specific investment is&#13;
not applicable. The economic analysis of this project has&#13;
included optimization of unit costs and cost effectiveness&#13;
considerations. At the sector level, private and social rates of&#13;
return to secondary education in the Greater Asuncion area are&#13;
15 percent and 13 percent, respectively.&#13;
Financial Benefits&#13;
and Risks:                The Borrower has selected fixed rate US dollar single currency&#13;
loan terms in order to improve the management of its extemal&#13;
liabilities and reduce its risks. The choice of US dollar terms&#13;
reflects the importance of the US and US dollar-based&#13;
contracts in Paraguay's international trade and Treasury&#13;
receipts. The Government considers a fixed interest rate&#13;
appropriate for the diversification of its interest rate risk and&#13;
management of the repayment stream.&#13;

PARAGUAY&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
SECONDARY EDUCATION IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND STRATEGY&#13;
1.1   Paraguay has recently begun to emerge from a long period of relative political and&#13;
cultural isolation. The transition to a democratic system has been stable following the&#13;
1989 coup that ended the 35-year dictatorship. Extreme poverty is low and income&#13;
distribution is better than average for Latin America. Despite some fluctuations,&#13;
macroeconomic management of the open economy has been generally sound. However,&#13;
key challenges remain, both to consolidate economic results and to further alleviate&#13;
poverty. The education sector is central to the twin goals of sustaining growth and&#13;
improving living standards.&#13;
A. Recent Economic and Political Developments&#13;
1.2   Economic Strategy. Paraguay's real GDP growth rate averaged 5.6 percent&#13;
annually between 1960 and 1992, the highest average rate in Latin America for this&#13;
period. This performance was primarily attributed to abundant land for agricultural&#13;
expansion; development of considerable hydroelectric resources; a defacto open economy&#13;
that allowed the sale of goods to visitors from its larger, highly protected neighbors; and a&#13;
small public sector which generated few distortions. However, economic performance&#13;
was uneven over this period, with a long period of economic growth and macroeconomic&#13;
stability during the 1960s and 1970s succeeded by economic deterioration in the early and&#13;
rnid-1980s. The Government that took office in early 1989 sought to rectify the economic&#13;
imbalances. GDP growth recovered to about 4 percent in 1993 and 3.5 percent in 1994.&#13;
1.3   Parallel to the internal reform progress, in 1991 Paraguay agreed to join a regional&#13;
trade group comprised of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Mercado Comun del&#13;
Cono Sur (Southern Cone Common Market), or MERCOSUR. In the context of&#13;
MERCOSUR, Paraguay has to contend with countries that have much larger internal&#13;
markets, better infrastructure, more skilled human resources and comparative advantages&#13;
in many of Paraguay's exports. To compete, Paraguay will need to invest heavily in&#13;
human resource development and basic infrastructure, as well as to enact key legal and&#13;
institutional reforms to attract needed investment. Without these actions, lack of a well-&#13;
trained labor force may constrain Paraguay's competitiveness.&#13;
1.4   Poverty Conditions. Paraguay appears to be among the countries in Latin&#13;
America where income is more evenly distributed and extreme poverty less widespread.&#13;
Nonetheless, social spending has historically been very low. As a result, access to and&#13;
quality of basic social services are uneven. Coverage of water and sanitation services is&#13;
deficient at an average of 46 percent for urban areas and 12 percent for rural areas,&#13;
representing almost half of the averages for Latin America. Infant mortality and life&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
expectancy are generally better than in many other Latin American countries. However,&#13;
maternal mortality remains high and, with the exception of Bolivia, Paraguay has the&#13;
highest fertility rate in South America. Even in the face of a rapidly expanding population,&#13;
Paraguay has achieved nearly universal primary education coverage. This feat is not&#13;
matched at the secondary level, where enrollment rates remain among the lowest in the&#13;
Region (para. 1. 10). Moreover, quality of social services is an issue at all levels.&#13;
1.5   Democratization. A new Constitution was adopted in June 1992 and the country&#13;
returned to democratic rule by 1993. Article 85 of the Constitution mandates that a&#13;
minimum of 20 percent of the Government budget be spent on education. The&#13;
Constitution also calls for basic education to be obligatory and free, and children to be&#13;
taught in their maternal language during the first years of instruction. The new&#13;
Administration places a high priority on improving social conditions, and has set out an&#13;
ambitious agenda of educational reforms. Pressure to change the educational system&#13;
stems as much from the desire to modernize and move Paraguayan society forward as&#13;
from the desire to break with the highly centralized education system of the past With the&#13;
creation of departmental governments (gobernaciones) under the Constitution, a political&#13;
process has been initiated to define the roles and responsibilities of various levels of&#13;
government, ultimately to include changes in resource flows and the entrance of new,&#13;
subnational actors into the education system. This process may ultimately lead to a more&#13;
decentralized education system and greater local control of schools. The challenge to the&#13;
Government is to design technically sound proposals and to negotiate with a newly-&#13;
embodied Congress which has demonstrated a proactive stance in the education sector.&#13;
B. Education Sector Overview&#13;
1.6   Structure of Education. Historically, the education system consisted of six years&#13;
of primary education for children age 7 to 12, six years of secondary education for&#13;
children age 13 to 18, and four to six years of higher education. Within secondary&#13;
education, the first three-year basic cycle was followed by a diversified upper-cycle&#13;
(Bachillerato). The diversified secondary education system, introduced in 1974, offers&#13;
concentrations in general (or academic), commercial, and technical areas. In addition, the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock administers about ten agricultural secondary&#13;
schools mainly in rural areas which award agricultural Bachilleratos.&#13;
1.7   The education system is currently being restructured to encompass nine years of&#13;
basic education, divided into three-year cycles (see Annex 1): first cycle: grades 1-3,&#13;
second cycle: grades 4-6, and third cycle: grades 7-9. Under the new structure, children&#13;
will start basic education at the age of six. The upper secondary level, which will be called&#13;
"middle education" (educaci6n media) under the reform, will continue to offer the existing&#13;
three tracks: general (academic-oriented), commercial (business and public&#13;
administration), and technical (industrial and other vocational education).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
1.8   Secondary graduates can opt for short-term, non-titular vocational courses given&#13;
through the National Service for Promotion and Professionalization (Servicio Nacional de&#13;
Promocion y Profesionalizaci6n, SNPP), or for four to six years of higher education&#13;
provided by the universities and other professional institutes. Until 1989, only two&#13;
institutions had full university status: the public National University of Asuncion&#13;
(Universidad Nacional de Asunci6n, UNA), and the Catholic University (Universidad&#13;
CatOlica, UC), a private institution subsidized by the state. Five private universities have&#13;
opened since 1990. In addition, the Institute for Higher Education (Instituto Superior de&#13;
Educaci6n, ISE) functions as the principal post-secondary teacher training facility in the&#13;
country. The duration of training for primary teaching is two years and three years for&#13;
secondary. ISE also offers a variety of in-service training programs.&#13;
1.9    Enrollment. Considering the fast-growing school age population and the&#13;
country's largely rural and dispersed population, the achievement in basic education is&#13;
laudable. The illiteracy rate is low compared with other Latin American countries, on a&#13;
par with Costa Rica and the other Southern Cone countries. This is largely a function of&#13;
high primary school enrollment rates over the last two decades. Gross enrollment rates&#13;
have been above 100 percent since the early 1970s, reflecting universal primary school&#13;
access for the 7- and 8-year-old population (see Annex 2 for basic educational statistics).&#13;
Primary net enrollment rates are also relatively high at 95 percent by 1993.&#13;
1.10  In contrast, secondary school enrollment is one of the lowest in the Region. In&#13;
1992, gross secondary school enrollment was estimated at 33 percent, with net enrollment&#13;
equivalent to 28 percent. This enrollment rate is well below both the average for the&#13;
Region (47 percent) and for countries of comparable income levels (55 percent),&#13;
especially compared with the Asian middle-income countries. Similarly, higher education&#13;
gross enrollment at 8 percent in 1991 is less than half of the average for middle income&#13;
countries (19 percent) and one of the lowest in Latin America.&#13;
1.11   Although growth rates for secondary education enrollment over the last ten years&#13;
have been higher than those for primary or tertiary, this is an improvement off a very low&#13;
base. Total secondary enrollment grew from 47,500 in 1969 to 212,248 in 1993 (Table&#13;
1.1). Two-thirds of all secondary school students are concentrated in the lower secondary&#13;
cycle. At the upper-secondary level, the majority of students follow the general track,&#13;
with 20 percent enrolled in the commercial track, and only 3 percent in the technical track.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
1.12  Access to secondary school remains largely an urban phenomenon, representing 88&#13;
percent of students. In addition, over 80 percent of rural secondary students are enrolled&#13;
in the lower secondary cycle, with access to the upper tracks limited in the rural areas to&#13;
5,240 students nationwide as of 1993 (see Annex 2). There are no technical track upper-&#13;
secondary schools in the rural areas, and only a few offer commercial track courses.&#13;
1.13  In terms of enrollment by gender, no significant discriminatory patterns are found&#13;
in Paraguay. At the primary level, male enrollment exceeds female enrollment slightly in&#13;
the first few grades. However, the gap narrows as the grades get higher, with the overall&#13;
share of primary enrollment of boys 51 percent versus 49 percent for girls. Considering&#13;
that the repetition rate is higher among males than females, a larger number of male&#13;
pfimary enrollment may be attributed to a larger number of male repeaters. At the&#13;
secondary level, enrollment is comprised of 51 percent girls. At the post-secondary level,&#13;
female enrollment at universities is significant (for instance female enrollment at the UNA&#13;
is about 48 percent), and even higher in the post-secondary teacher training institutes&#13;
where women make up three-quarters of the student body.&#13;
1.14 Principal Actors in the System. The education system is highly centralized. The&#13;
Ministry of Education (Minis:erio de Educaci6ny Culto, MEC) is responsible for the&#13;
provision of public education at the primary and secondary levels. Virtually all&#13;
administrative functions of the MEC are centralized in Asuncion. However, seven&#13;
regional education centers, designed in the 1 970s as model schools to provide the full&#13;
range of educational opportunities including teacher training, provide contact points at the&#13;
sub-national level. To date, municipal and the recently-created regional governments have&#13;
not been active in the education sector. As for universities, under the Constitution, they&#13;
are autonomous and have the authority to establish their own forms of administration.&#13;
1.15  Private Sector. The private sector plays an important role in the education sector,&#13;
accounting for 13 percent of primary enrollment and 21 percent of secondary enrollment.&#13;
These shares have been relatively stable over the past ten years. In addition, there are&#13;
parochial schools officially classified as public schools, with school administration&#13;
managed by religious organizations and teachers' salaries financed by the MEC. Of a&#13;
total of 966 secondary schools in Paraguay in 1993, 683 were public, 242 private and 41&#13;
parochial. Private schools are usually more prestigious, and the quality and efficiency is&#13;
higher than that of public schools. The quality of parochial schools is also generally&#13;
considered to be higher than that of public schools. Although private and parochial&#13;
schools are provided considerable freedom in terms of management and course content,&#13;
they are required to follow the general precepts of the national curriculum, and are subject&#13;
to evaluation by supervisors of the MEC. At the university level enrollment is largely&#13;
public, although private sector participation has increased significantly.&#13;
1.16 Community Participation. Paraguay has a long tradition of active community&#13;
participation in education. Parents' associations (cooperadoras escolares) support school&#13;
and classroom construction and maintenance, finance the purchase and maintenance of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
educational materials, and disseminate information on schools to the communities. In&#13;
many instances, parents' associations pay incremental teachers' salaries, particularly for&#13;
the creation of new courses at the lower secondary level, until such salaries can be&#13;
absorbed within the public budget. The MEC is currently revising the decree to broaden&#13;
and formalize the role and responsibilities of these associations, which henceforth will be&#13;
legally installed as Comisiones Cooperadoras Escolares.&#13;
1.17  The MEC has supported the active participation of parents' associations largely as&#13;
a mechanism for cofinancing educational investments at both the primary and secondary&#13;
levels. A Social Action Department exists within the NEC to support and monitor the&#13;
participation of the cooperadoras. In recent years, the MIEC has transferred funds directly&#13;
to the cooperadoras to purchase equipment and materials and then carry out the&#13;
construction of new classrooms either using donated labor from the community or by sub-&#13;
contracting labor paid by the cooperadoras. The results have been significant, with 345&#13;
new classrooms built by this method in 1993 at the primary and secondary levels, for a&#13;
total MEC disbursement of over US$1 million, and a reduction in unit costs.&#13;
1.18  Sector Financing Framework. The level of total government expenditures is&#13;
low, and at 11.5 percent of GDP in 1993 was not only one of the lowest in the Region but&#13;
one of the lowest in the world. This translates into limited public resources, in general, for&#13;
the social sectors. As a result, Paraguay's public expenditures in education are among the&#13;
lowest in Latin America (see Annex 3). While maintaining emphasis on universal primary&#13;
school enrollment, this limited public spending on education has been possible through:&#13;
(a) constraining access to the higher-cost secondary education; (b) sacrifices in quality at&#13;
all levels; and (c) significant private spending on education.&#13;
1.19 In 1991', public spending on education was equivalent to only 1.9 percent of GDP,&#13;
compared with a regional average for Latin America of 3.5 percent and well below&#13;
countries at similar per capita income levels. In terms of the overall budget composition,&#13;
education's share declined throughout most of the 1980s, falling from about 15 percent in&#13;
1983 to 10 percent in 1991. This trend was significantly reversed in 1992-93, when&#13;
increases in teachers' salaries boosted education's share in the national budget to about 17&#13;
percent and its share of GDP to 2.9 percent by 1993. These recent wage increases&#13;
represent the first real increase in teachers' salaries in the past ten years (see Annex 3).&#13;
1.20  Within the education sector, primary education has been the main recipient of&#13;
government funds over the past decade. About half of public educational expenditures go&#13;
to the primary level, slightly over 25 percent to secondary, and the remainder to higher&#13;
education. This translates into a 1992 average unit cost per student of about US$134 for&#13;
primary and US$245 for secondary. The lion's share of the education budget goes to pay&#13;
wages. Teachers' salaries account for about 95 percent of the recurrent expenditure&#13;
budget at the primary level and 99 percent at the secondary level, leaving few resources&#13;
available for teaching materials, building maintenance and other inputs. Capital&#13;
' 1991 is the most recent year for which significant cross-country data are available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
expenditures have been negligible over the past ten years, with continual declines in real&#13;
resources throughout the 1 980s. Only in 1992 did real capital investments in education&#13;
recover to 1982 levels. The MEC's administrative costs (including school supervision)&#13;
accounts for about 18 percent of its budget.&#13;
1.21  Private spending is significant at all levels in both the public and private systems.&#13;
Within the private system, a sample of private secondary schools in Asuncion revealed that&#13;
1994 annual tuition and fees (not including expenditures on books, uniforms, and other&#13;
inputs) ranged from US$350 to US$1,000 per student depending on the quality and&#13;
prestige of the school. Within public schools, private spending is substantial though not&#13;
necessarily equitable. Parents pay through a combination of school fees, expenditures on&#13;
textbooks, supplies and uniforms, and in-kind or cash contributions through the&#13;
cooperadoras escolares. The payments are often greatest in areas where Government&#13;
does not reach, such as more dispersed populations. Tuition and fees, at between US$34&#13;
and US$49 for public secondary schools depending on the level and track, are about ten to&#13;
thirty times less than those of private secondary schools. While comprehensive and recent&#13;
data are scant, a 1985 Bank sector review estimated that families were paying 23 percent&#13;
of the cost of primary schooling, 36 percent of the cost of secondary schooling and only&#13;
18 percent of the cost of higher education. In 1992, in the schools with cooperadoras, 67&#13;
percent of the nonsalary costs were financed by these associations. While school tuition&#13;
and fees are generally low, they did permit school directors to finance some basic inputs&#13;
and services and the school level. Until 1993 public school fees were collected and&#13;
managed autonomously at the school level. The Ministry of Finance has substituted a&#13;
central collection system through the National Treasury, which appears to be less agile and&#13;
may have a negative impact at the school level.&#13;
C. Key Sector Issues&#13;
1.22  The main issues affecting the Paraguayan secondary education system, to be&#13;
addressed by the proposed project, include: (a) limited and inequitable access to the&#13;
secondary level; (b) generally low levels of learning achievement, and particularly in core&#13;
skills such as Spanish, mathematics and sciences; (c) secondary school graduates often ill-&#13;
prepared to satisfy the needs of either higher education or the labor market; and (d) weak&#13;
institutional capacity to design and to execute the modernization and reform process.&#13;
1.23  Access to Secondary School. As described in the enrollment statistics (paras.&#13;
1.9-1.13), coverage at the secondary level is so low that it may constrain Paraguay's&#13;
prospects for economic development. Demand is outstripping supply as reflected in the&#13;
large wedge between primary and secondary enrollment rates and the large drop-off in&#13;
enrollment levels between the last year of primary and the first year of secondary school.&#13;
Parents queue for hours or even days to register their children at secondary schools,&#13;
particularly in the peri-urban areas. School principals routinely base admission on the&#13;
grade averages of candidates in order to ration the limited supply of places. Parental&#13;
pressure often leads to one or two years being added on to rural primary schools to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
accommodate aspirations for their children's continuing education. This constrained&#13;
access tends to disfavor low-income students.&#13;
1.24  The access issue also affects quality. There is evidence of extreme overcrowding&#13;
in many peri-urban classrooms, reducing teaching effectiveness and contributing to the&#13;
wear and tear on school infrastructure. Even with active community participation, a&#13;
backlog of infrastructure needs exists at the secondary level, including rehabilitation and&#13;
construction of classrooms and complementary facilities to decongest existing spaces and&#13;
to provide for new students. With 98 percent of schools operating on at least two shifts&#13;
(often as a primary school in the morning and a secondary school in the afternoon), the&#13;
MEC will find it difficult to increase access without the expansion of school facilities.&#13;
1.25 Learning Achievement Levels and Educational Quality. Learning&#13;
achievements in the secondary education system are unsatisfactory. In 1991, only half of&#13;
all secondary students who took final exams passed them. Greater problems are apparent&#13;
in the lower cycle of secondary school, where only 57 percent passed the last year of that&#13;
cycle, compared to 73 percent who passed the last year of upper-secondary school,&#13;
reflecting a weeding-out phenomenon and the heritage of poor quality at the primary level.&#13;
However, these statistics should be interpreted with caution as there are no standard&#13;
academic achievement tests, and therefore results are highly dependent on the teachers'&#13;
testing criteria and individual school performance cannot be compared. In addition to&#13;
requiring a secondary school diploma, entrance exams are administered by each university&#13;
faculty. Because of the low quality of public secondary schools, it is not unusual to have&#13;
secondary school graduates take additional courses, often through the private sector, to&#13;
qualify for university admission. The statistics of the past two decades reveal that only half&#13;
of the applicants to UNA pass the entrance exams.&#13;
1.26 The determinants of student learning and the reasons for poor learning outcomes&#13;
are complex. One of the issues is linguistic. Paraguay presents the unique challenge of a&#13;
largely bilingual population, with 40 percent of the population speaking only Guarani.&#13;
Under the national curriculum, Guarani is taught as a required language at the primary&#13;
and lower-secondary levels. Based on the experience with a pilot program of bilingual&#13;
education in the early 1 980s, the Government is embarking on a more ambitious bilingual&#13;
program for the first three years of primary school. Nonetheless, this issue will continue&#13;
to pose challenges of quality at the intake of secondary school, particularly in the rural&#13;
areas. Attention needs to be placed on strengthening communication skills in Spanish at&#13;
the secondary level to satisfy the demands of the modern labor market.&#13;
1.27 The usual deficiencies found in many countries also affect learning outcomes in&#13;
Paraguay. Textbooks and materials available to secondary schools are largely outdated&#13;
and are not consistent with the basic tenets of the Education Reform agenda, namely&#13;
student-centered learning which promotes creativity, critical thinking, open dialogue, and&#13;
problem-solving skills. Moreover, supply is scarce, and even where textbooks are&#13;
available in schools, there is an administrative culture which tends to 'warehouse'&#13;
textbooks as a school resource rather than promote their use as a student learning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
instrument. School libraries and complementary educational materials are also scarce. In&#13;
the case of laboratory facilities, those that exist remain significantly underused due to high&#13;
maintenance and restocking costs, poor initial design and little training to optimize their&#13;
use, as well as the pressure to use labs as regular classrooms in the face of overcrowding.&#13;
1.28   The quality of teaching practices is highly variable. Overall, teaching efforts are&#13;
thwarted by overcrowded or inadequate infrastructure, lack of good textbooks and&#13;
reference materials and a dearth of training. For years, low salaries demoralized teaching&#13;
staff, although recent increases have begun to restore the viability of the profession.  At&#13;
the secondary level, inadequate salaries had created so-called "taxi teachers" in urban&#13;
areas, who move between schools to maximize the number of shifts they teach during the&#13;
day. The growth of secondary schools and the limited expansion of teacher training at the&#13;
secondary level have created a shortfall of certified secondary teachers. Approximately&#13;
one out of four secondary teachers have only secondary education. On the other hand, 28&#13;
percent of secondary teachers have a university degrees but have not had any teacher&#13;
training in the area in which they are teaching. Expanded enrollment in secondary teacher&#13;
training should address, in part, the short-term needs for new secondary school teachers.&#13;
There are currently about 1,000 students being prepared as secondary school teachers.&#13;
1.29 One final element in low achievement levels is the limited amount of time students&#13;
actually spend learning. For instance, the "time on task" is well below standards. At the&#13;
primary level, the official school timetable requires only 680 hours per year of&#13;
instructional time, in contrast to the average of 839 for LAC countries which is already the&#13;
lowest among all the world's regions. At the secondary level, consistent international&#13;
comparisons are not available, but the same pattern appears to apply.&#13;
1.30   Internal Efficiency of Secondary Education. Internal efficiency of the system,&#13;
although better than in many countries in the Region has potential for improvement. The&#13;
poor quality of statistics and methodological weaknesses of repetition, drop-out, retention&#13;
and promotion rates call for a very cautious interpretation of these indicators. The average&#13;
primary school student stays for 6.3 years, but only passes 4.8 grades. At the primary&#13;
level, official statistics show an average repetition rate of 8.3 percent and drop-out rate of&#13;
4.2 percent for 1993. However, it is likely that actual repetition rates are higher than&#13;
those reported2. Using a simulation model to estimate student flows, Schiefelbein and&#13;
Heikkinen3 found an average repetition rate at the primary level of 20 percent and a drop-&#13;
out rate of 5 percent. Repetition rates tend to be lower for girls than boys, for urban&#13;
versus rural schools and for private over public schools. Overall, the student/teacher ratio&#13;
at the primary level is 24, with an average of 30 for urban schools and 21 in rural areas.&#13;
2 For instance, students who drop out before taking the final exam are likely to be reported as new students&#13;
rather than repeaters the next year. Students who change schools during the year are recorded as&#13;
drop-outs since there is no system for tracking individual student movements.&#13;

UNESCO-OREALC Regional System of Information, Santiago 1991.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
1.31   The average student/teacher ratio at the secondary level is about 30, though the&#13;
method of payment by teaching hours and salary slot (cargo docente) makes accurate&#13;
estimation difficult. Though official statistics are not processed, at the secondary level&#13;
estimates indicate relatively significant repetition and drop-out and low promotion and&#13;
retention rates. The national average retention rate for the full cycle of six years is&#13;
approximately 50 percent, with a range of about 14 percent for rural areas versus 65&#13;
percent in the Asunci6n area. Unofficial statistics estimate an average repetition rate of 9&#13;
percent and drop-out rate of 15 percent over the six years of secondary school. The large&#13;
number of incomplete secondary schools contributes to these low rates.&#13;
1.32  External Efficiency. Average years of education of the work force have risen&#13;
over time, from four to about six in 1992 for the population over 25 years old. According&#13;
to most recent estimates, Paraguay was slightly above the LAC average, largely due to the&#13;
high primary school enrollment rates4, but below the average schooling levels of its major&#13;
trading partners (with the notable exception of Brazil). This country indicator disguises&#13;
large regional disparities, particularly for rural areas. The 1993 Household Survey of the&#13;
greater Asuncion area found that of the population ten years or older and economically&#13;
active, only one percent of the population had no education, 40 percent had some primary,&#13;
18 percent some lower-track cycle of secondary, 27 percent some upper-track secondary&#13;
and 15 percent some university education.&#13;
1.33 Returns to education in the workplace show significant earnings differentials by&#13;
education level, although data are only available for urban areas. In greater Asuncion,&#13;
workers who have completed university earn six times more than illiterate workers, 3.5&#13;
times more than workers with primary education, and 2.1 times more than workers with&#13;
complete secondary schooling. Primary education exhibits the highest private and social&#13;
rates of return, at 24 percent and 20 percent respectively. In greater Asuncion, private&#13;
rates of return for secondary education in 1990 were estimated at 15 percent, about the&#13;
same as the LAC regional average. Social rates of return, at 13 percent, were higher than&#13;
the regional average of 11 percent.&#13;
1.34  There is not sufficient information to analyze the relationships between the&#13;
education system and the labor market. To help orient the structure and curriculum of the&#13;
secondary level, there is a clear need for better information and analysis on the dynamics&#13;
of the labor market, including wage levels and skill gaps, and tracer studies of both labor&#13;
market and higher education outcomes of secondary school students. The annual&#13;
household surveys carried out by the General Statistics and Census Office, to be extended&#13;
to the national level starting in the 1995 round, will provide important information on the&#13;
evolution of labor markets and education level of the population.&#13;
1.35 Sector Management and Formulation of Sector Policies. Managerial&#13;
weaknesses are common throughout the public sector and decision-making is highly&#13;
centralized. Although most rank and file civil servants are experienced in their jobs,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
routine matters are handled at the highest levels, often causing substantial delays.&#13;
Budgeting processes and investment decisions often lack analytical foundations. Norms&#13;
and regulations for procurement, accounting and auditing have not proven efficient nor&#13;
have they kept up with changes in technology and sound management practices. These&#13;
systemic weaknesses apply equally to the MEC and are summarized as follows:&#13;
1.36 Centralized Decision-Making. Historically, most managerial decisions have been&#13;
concentrated in Asunci6n and at very high levels, even when they pertain to local&#13;
problems, such as the performance of a school principal. The democratization process has&#13;
increased pressures on MEC managers, initiating a process of greater transparency in&#13;
decision-making and responsiveness to community concerns. As the management level is&#13;
overwhelmed with routine tasks, there is little time for strategic and policy-level planning,&#13;
or for effective monitoring of sector performance. The centralization of functions is&#13;
tempered by the strong, albeit defacto, role of school principals at the local level.&#13;
1.37 Coordination in the MEC. MEC operational departments function in relative&#13;
independence, if not isolation, from each other. This has led to duplication of efforts,&#13;
inconsistencies in information and difficulties coordinating services which encompass more&#13;
than one department. Recently, there have been some efforts to improve inter-&#13;
departmental cooperation. Through the preparation of the proposed project, working&#13;
groups were formed to integrate the themes of each project component across the&#13;
functional lines of the MEC.&#13;
1.38 School Supervision. The MEC has approximately fifty secondary school&#13;
supervisors covering an average of 20 schools each. Their role is more as an inspector,&#13;
checking administrative matters, with little time allocated for supporting teaching quality.&#13;
In addition, little training is provided to school supervisors and principals in school&#13;
management, curriculum implementation and other aspects of school performance.&#13;
1.39 Inadequate Monitoring, Evaluation and Policy Design. Carried out as part of&#13;
project preparation activities, an evaluation of the educational statistics system found that&#13;
the current information system is characterized by a high degree of centralization,&#13;
duplication of efforts and lack of coordination between various departments, use of&#13;
outdated or insufficient infornmation technology, little feedback to users, problems in the&#13;
quality of data received due to lack of standard definitions, and little training and&#13;
supervision of personnel at the school level. In addition, there is no systematic and&#13;
standardized system for comparing student achievement accurately between schools.&#13;
D. Government Strategy and Recent Initiatives in Education&#13;
1.40   Education Reform. With the political changes in 1989, the Government&#13;
undertook to review the education situation and to establish a new plan for the sector&#13;
attuned to the emerging needs of the country. To this end, the Educational Reform&#13;
Advisory Council (Consejo de la Reforma Educativa) was created (Executive Decree No.&#13;
7815, November 1990), consisting of 12 members, including representatives of academia,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-l l-&#13;
the private and non-governmental sectors. The objectives of the Council were to prepare&#13;
an analysis of the education system, design a reform program and oversee implementation.&#13;
1.41   The MEC embarked upon a participatory process to refine the reform agenda.&#13;
Representatives of parents' associations, teachers, school principals and supervisors&#13;
gathered at the local and national levels to discuss reform proposals. In late 1992, the&#13;
guidelines of education reform were presented by the Council and approved at the&#13;
National Education Congress (Conigreso Nacional de Educaci6n, CNE). The major&#13;
changes proposed were: (a) restructuring of the present six years of primary and six years&#13;
of secondary education into a system of nine years of basic education and three years of&#13;
'middle' education (see para. 1.7); (b) dividing basic education into three cycles with a&#13;
duration of three years each; (c) strengthening pre-school education to address the limited&#13;
coverage at present, and (d) lowering the age for entry into primary school from seven&#13;
years to six. In addition, a revised curriculum was proposed, to include flexibility for the&#13;
development of local curricula within the parameters of the national curriculum.&#13;
Curriculum content is to emphasize the opening of civil society, including the inclusion of&#13;
civic themes, critical thinking skills, and student-centered learning processes.&#13;
1.42 The Government inaugurated in August 1993 places education, especially&#13;
education reform, as a priority. Congress is currently working on the General Education&#13;
Law, the preliminary draft of which calls for the creation of a National Education Council&#13;
and the restructuring of the MEC. Some reform initiatives are already underway, most&#13;
importantly the implementation of the revised curriculum. Changes in the secondary&#13;
school curriculum are to be phased in upon implementation of the primary curriculum.&#13;
1.43 Rationalization and Modernization of the MEC. The MEC has made initial&#13;
efforts to increase its administrative and operational efficiency. Following retirements of&#13;
technical and managerial level personnel, transparent and competitive recruitment&#13;
procedures have been introduced, particularly for school supervisors and directors. Also,&#13;
an independent audit of the payroll has been completed which found significant anomalies,&#13;
including "ghost teachers", "ghost schools", professors receiving more than one salary,&#13;
and excessive teaching hours assigned to individuals. Based on these audits,&#13;
rationalization of the personnel structure within secondary schools was initiated in mid-&#13;
1994, permitting the MEC to generate savings sufficient to finance 34 new courses,&#13;
equivalent to five new complete secondary schools and one partial school (grades 7-10).&#13;
1.44  Investment Strategy. To support the implementation of its reform program, the&#13;
Government has developed a significant investment program in education, and has sought&#13;
policy advice and external financing to underpin this investment strategy. The US$59.0&#13;
million IDB-financed Primary Education Improvement Project became effective in March&#13;
1994. This project aims to improve the quality of pre-school and primary education, to&#13;
increase its internal efficiency, and to strengthen the administration of the education&#13;
system. Specifically, the project comprises: (a) improvements in education and teacher&#13;
quality through the redesign and implementation of a new primary-level curriculum,&#13;
provision of textbooks and teaching materials, expansion of access to pre-school&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
education, rehabilitation of primary school infrastructure, community information&#13;
campaigns, and the overhaul of the teacher training system, and (b) management&#13;
strengthening of the MEC in the areas of management and administrative information&#13;
systems (budgeting, property and inventory, personnel, and financial administration),&#13;
implementation of a school mapping exercise, development of a National Education&#13;
Evaluation System, strengthening of primary school supervision, as well as design of a&#13;
new functional organization of the MEC and the legal framework of the sector.&#13;
1.45   At the same time, the Government is seeking World Bank assistance at the&#13;
secondary level. Preparation of the proposed project has been coordinated closely with&#13;
the IDB project. Areas of joint support and division of labor have been clearly identified.&#13;
The two project coordination units are working closely in sharing information and plan&#13;
project activities. To formalize this relationship, a cooperation agreement between the&#13;
two projects, authorized by the Minister, was presented at negotiations (para. 6.1 (a)).&#13;
E. Bank Experience and Strategy&#13;
1.46   Since the early 1970s, the Bank has invested a total of US$39.1 million in five&#13;
education and training projects in Paraguay. In the 1970s, the Bank financed three&#13;
projects: (a) diversified secondary education, including the creation of the technical track,&#13;
(b) non-formal vocational training, and (c) the expansion of access to rural primary&#13;
education.5 In the 1980s, there were follow-on operations in rural primary education and&#13;
non-formal vocational training.6&#13;
1.47 While these projects increased access to primary and secondary school and&#13;
efficiency through better promotion and retention rates than in the 1970s, the institutional&#13;
impacts have eroded over time. OED reports found that the largely successful completion&#13;
of the physical targets of these projects was a direct result of strong and autonomous&#13;
project implementation units. However, after the Bank's hiatus from operations in&#13;
Paraguay in the mid-1980s, the experience of long-standing project implementation units&#13;
in education has largely been lost.&#13;
5 The First Education Project (Credit 347-PA), a US$5.1 million credit approved in December 1972,&#13;
financed the construction of diversified schools as well as the strengthening of the Department of&#13;
Technical and Vocational Education within the MEC. The Second Education Project (Loan 1252-T-&#13;
PA) a USS4.0 million loan approved in May 1976, supported non-formal vocational training through&#13;
SNPP. The Third Education Project (Loan 1346-PA/Credit 667-PA), a loan of US$8 million&#13;
approved December 1976, addressed rural primary education.&#13;
6(a) the Rural Primary Education Project (Loan 1992-PA), a loan of US$17 million to improve access to&#13;
and quality of rural prirary schools, and (b) the Second Vocational Training Project (Loan 2373-&#13;
PA), a US$5 million loan executed by the SNPP to promote rural development through improving&#13;
productivity, income and self-employment in selected agricultural frontier areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
1.48   Lessons Learned in Education Projects7. The Bank's experience in the&#13;
education sector worldwide, along with specific lessons from Paraguay, have influenced&#13;
the objectives and the design of the proposed project. Experience suggests the following:&#13;
1.49   Educational Content. As put forth in the Bank's Vocational and Technical&#13;
Education and Training Policy Paper (1991), investments at the secondary level should&#13;
focus on improving core skills, especially in basic studies such as mathematics, science and&#13;
language, more than specialized technical knowledge. The experience shows that better&#13;
core skills improve worker adaptability to a rapidly changing workplace and promote&#13;
"trainability" of secondary school graduates.&#13;
1.50   Textbooks, School Libraries and Teaching Materials. Success in the effective&#13;
provision and use of these inputs depends on arrangements for the selection, publication,&#13;
procurement, distribution, storage, usage and financing of these inputs. Common&#13;
problems include: (a) poorly defined or ill-understood institutional and procurement&#13;
arrangements which result in inconsistent supply, inadequate timing and unreliable delivery&#13;
of these inputs; (b) limited technical capacity to select textbooks and materials, including&#13;
links between textbook content, curriculum and other educational objectives; and (c)&#13;
neglect of aspects related to book and teaching material utilization.&#13;
1.51    Educational Assessment Systems. To develop a country's assessment&#13;
capabilities, experience shows that it is necessary to: (a) ensure adequate technical training&#13;
and specialized personnel as part of the required staff, and (b) realistically assess the role&#13;
of the public sector, which should include formulation of assessment policies, test&#13;
development and monitoring and dissemination of results; and (c) shore up weak ministry&#13;
capacity with sub-contracting of key functions to universities or the private sector.&#13;
1.52   In-Service Teacher Training. For components supporting in-service teacher&#13;
training, the record is mixed. More successful experiences make clear distinctions&#13;
between activities to certify untrained teachers and those activities to upgrade the skills&#13;
and knowledge of current teachers. Programs that seek to improve teaching skills,&#13;
especially with the use of textbooks and teaching materials, are generally effective when&#13;
they are designed and implemented in the teachers' work environment.&#13;
1.53   Sustainability. Involving policy-makers and technical staff from the early stages&#13;
of project identification and design is a prerequisite for achieving project sustainability.&#13;
Other elements of project sustainability include: (a) providing for broad participation of&#13;
'This section is based on: (a) a review of 24 Project Performance Audit Reports, Project Completion&#13;
Reports and Staff Appraisal Reports from the LAC, Asia and Africa regions; (b) recommendations&#13;
from the following Bank documents: The Sustainabilitv of Investment Projects in Education (Report&#13;
No. 9225, OED, 1991); Lending for Learning: Twenty Years of World Bank Support for Basic&#13;
Education (Report WPS 686, PER, 1991); Textbooks in the Developing World: Economic and&#13;
Educational Choices, EDI, 1989); Effective Implementation: Key to Development Impact (Report of&#13;
the World Bank's Portfolio Management Task Force, 1992); Developing Educational Assessment&#13;
Systems in Latin America (Report No. 9, LATHR, 1991); and (c) Project Completion Reports and&#13;
Project Performance Audit Reports of previous Bank education projects in Paraguay.&#13;

-14-&#13;
system managers and stakeholders, including school principals and parents' associations,&#13;
(b) addressing in a timely manner the issue of counterpart funding, (c) defining both long-&#13;
and short-term project objectives so as to facilitate implementation. monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, and (d) building in project ownership.&#13;
1.54  Monitoring and Evaluation. Many of the impacts of previous investments in the&#13;
education sector are difficult to assess because of a lack of effective monitoring and&#13;
evaluation indicators and systems. Moreover, while quantitative targets of input delivery&#13;
have been relatively easy to track, the impacts on leaming achievement, internal and&#13;
external efficiency and overall institution-building objectives are not well understood. The&#13;
ability to measure these types of impacts should be built into monitoring efforts.&#13;
1.55  Lessons from Recent Experience in Paraguay. Project ownership and early&#13;
attention to implementation issues, especially procurement and disbursement&#13;
arrangements, have been crucial to the success of Bank investments.  In addition, the&#13;
strength of community participation has been effectively incorporated into Bank-financed&#13;
projects, most notably in rural water and sanitation investments, increasing the&#13;
sustainability and relevance of these projects. Maintaining timely and adequate&#13;
supervision has allowed for quality control and critical adjustments necessary during&#13;
implementation. While the most recent Country Implementation Review (December&#13;
1994) found no major shortfalls in counterpart funding, this may be largely a function of&#13;
the small number of projects in execution as the Bank rebuilds its portfolio in Paraguay.&#13;
Particular attention must be paid to the budgeting cycle and administrative requirements&#13;
for assigning counterpart funds under current public finance rules.&#13;
1.56  Effective implementation of education projects has relied on the creation of&#13;
efficient project units with well-qualified staff, direct access to the Minister of Education,&#13;
and continuous communications with supervisors, teachers and school administrators.&#13;
Provision of inputs was highly satisfactory. However, longer-term objectives, particularly&#13;
in institutional development and improved sector quality and efficiency, are more difficult&#13;
to assess due to weaknesses in monitoring and evaluation systems, lack of reliability of&#13;
official educational statistics, and a dearth of information on students.&#13;
1.57  Building on Lessons Learned. These lessons have been systematically&#13;
incorporated into the proposed project. Substantial advance planning and preparation&#13;
have been carried out through a PPF and a PRHD grant from the Japanese Government.&#13;
This has allowed for advance staffing of the key positions of the Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU), including training in procurement and disbursement issues. Project preparation&#13;
has also financed technical assistance and training to MEC personnel in key areas of&#13;
project design to raise project quality and ensure ownership by the MEC rank and file.&#13;
1.58  The design of the project has taken into consideration: (a) giving priority to&#13;
improvements in core skills at the secondary level; (b) creating an appropriate information&#13;
and analytical basis for monitoring project and sector developments; (c) strengthening of&#13;
community participation and local school management; (d) incorporating school-based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
teacher training linked explicitly to the selection and delivery of textbooks and other&#13;
educational materials to be provided by the proposed project; (e) building in elements of&#13;
teacher selection into the procurement of these materials; (f) defining a strategy for&#13;
student assessment appropriate for the thin institutional context in Paraguay, including&#13;
sub-contracting of selected parts of the system to private actors; (g) agreeing with&#13;
Government on overall counterpart funding levels and mechanisms to ensure that annual&#13;
allocations are disbursed in a timely manner.&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
1.59   On-going operations were halted in the mid-1980s after the Bank suspended&#13;
disbursements in response to deteriorating macroeconomic management. With significant&#13;
improvements in economic policies in the early-I 990s, the Bank renewed its partnership&#13;
with Paraguay. As a first step, intensive efforts went into rebuilding the Bank's analysis of&#13;
economic and social conditions8. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),&#13;
discussed by the Board on December 21, 1993, focuses on three objectives: (a) private&#13;
sector development, (b) agricultural development and natural resource management, and&#13;
(c) poverty alleviation through human resources development.&#13;
1.60  The Bank's assistance strategy in poverty and human resources development calls&#13;
for increasing access to secondary education, improving educational quality at all levels,&#13;
deconcentrating sector management, promoting community participation, and&#13;
strengthening institutional capacity. Attention to the secondary education level is relevant&#13;
to improving Paraguay's opportunities in the context of greater regional economic&#13;
competition within MERCOSUR. The proposed project would be the first step in&#13;
addressing the critical need to improve educational quality and overall sector management.&#13;
The proposed project would provide essential inputs while building the institutional,&#13;
analytical and policy foundations of a more far-reaching reform agenda in the future. The&#13;
proposed project complements the Bank portfolio and is fully consistent with the CAS.&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Components&#13;
2.1    The proposed project would support the Government's initiatives to improve the&#13;
quality, efficiency and coverage of secondary education (particularly the third cycle of&#13;
basic education), and to increase the MEC's institutional capacity for information-based&#13;
8 A Country Economic Memorandum - CEM (Report No. 9147-PA dated October 15, 1991), a Public&#13;
Expenditure Review: The Social Sectors (Report No. 10193-PA dated June 16, 1992), a study of the&#13;
implications of Paraguay's joining the MERCOSUR trade area (Report No. 10902-PA dated January&#13;
28, 1993), a poverty assessment (Poverty and the Social Sectors in Paraguay, Report No. 12293-PA,&#13;
dated June 29, 1994) and June 1994 updated CEM (Report No. 11723-PA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
decision-making. The specific objectives of the project would be to: (a) build the&#13;
necessary information base on educational system conditions and performance, essential&#13;
for the design and monitoring of sectoral policies and strategies, (b) improve teaching and&#13;
learning conditions within the classroom through the provision of essential inputs and&#13;
improved physical conditions; (c) gradually ease overcrowding and expand access at the&#13;
secondary level, beginning with grades 7-9; and (d) support more dynamic and&#13;
participatory school management at the local level.&#13;
2.2   The proposed project would consist of five components. The project would&#13;
increase institutional capacity through: Institutional Strengthening (US$3.2 million, or&#13;
nine percent of project base costs) to (a) develop an educational statistics system to track&#13;
student flows and system efficiency; (b) design and implement a student assessment system&#13;
to measure learning achievement; and (c) conduct research and policy studies to facilitate&#13;
information-based decision-making and increase the capacity to evaluate the impacts of&#13;
education investments. These efforts would apply to the education sector in general. The&#13;
quality, efficiency and coverage of secondary education would be improved by: Provision&#13;
of Textbooks, Educational Materials and Curricular Support (US$6. I million, or 17&#13;
percent of project base costs) to support the implementation of the revised curriculum and&#13;
access to and quality of learning materials for the final cycle of basic education; Training&#13;
for Teachers and School Managers (US$2.2 million, or six percent of base costs) to&#13;
support upgrading and innovations in the professional ability of secondary school teachers&#13;
as well as training and orientation in school management for supervisors, school principals&#13;
and parents' associations; Infrastructure Upgrading and Expansion (US$20.5 million,&#13;
or 57 percent of base costs) to finance the rehabilitation and expansion of classrooms and&#13;
school-based facilities and the provision of basic school furniture, and would continue&#13;
incentives for the involvement of parents' associations in the cofinancing of school&#13;
infrastructure; and a Pilot Proposal for School-Based Innovation Projects (US$1.0&#13;
million, or 3 percent of base costs) to develop a small pilot experience in demand-driven,&#13;
school-based innovations designed by the schools themselves, modeled after the&#13;
experiences underway in Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay. In addition, support to the Project&#13;
Coordination Unit and PPF refinancing accounts for the remaining six and one percent of&#13;
base costs, respectively.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
Component 1: Institutional Strengthening&#13;
2.3   The objective of this component is to build the informational and analytical basis&#13;
for monitoring educational developments, as well as to design appropriate sectoral&#13;
policies. The focus will be on micro-level information (e.g., assessment of student&#13;
achievement levels), system information (e.g., an education statistics system to monitor&#13;
student flows), and sectoral analysis through policy studies, research and impact&#13;
evaluations. Other areas of institutional weaknesses, particularly in administrative,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
management and control functions of the MEC, are being addressed through the 1DB-&#13;
financed project (paras. 1.44).&#13;
Sub-Component: Development of an Educational Statistics System&#13;
2.4   The general objective of this sub-component is to establish an educational&#13;
information system which supports the needs of each level of the system, thereby creating&#13;
an effective tool to plan and evaluate education system performance. Specifically, the sub-&#13;
component would seek to: (a) improve the quality of information currently processed;&#13;
(b) disseminate information based on a communications strategy oriented both toward the&#13;
sector and to the general public; and (c) provide sufficient technology and training to each&#13;
level of intervention (school, supervision region, and central MEC departments) which has&#13;
a role in collecting and processing educational statistics.&#13;
2.5   To attain these objectives, the sub-component would carry out activities in four&#13;
main areas. The initial stage would focus on the design of an appropriate statistics system,&#13;
including the development of a Manual of Educational Indicators, workshops to build&#13;
consensus on the information needs of each level in the system, redesign and adjustments&#13;
to existing data collection instruments, and creation of manuals for statistical&#13;
administration for each level (local, regional and national). The implementation phase&#13;
would define data base configurations and procure information technology (software,&#13;
hardware and other office technology) required by each level concerned in the processing&#13;
and diffusion of statistical information. After implementation at the central level in the&#13;
first year, decentralization of information processing would be carried out through the&#13;
implementation of information technology at the regional and school levels on an&#13;
experimental basis in 50 selected institutions (schools, supervision offices, and regional&#13;
government offices). Training in system administration would be conducted initially at the&#13;
central level, followed by regional workshops. Central level training would include the use&#13;
of models to project student enrollment rates as a basic management tool of the&#13;
Department of Planning. The sub-component would also finance analysis and&#13;
dissemination of indicators, with particular attention to feedback mechanisms to the&#13;
school level to improve local school management. The education statistics system would&#13;
become the mechanism for continual updating of the IDB-financed school mapping&#13;
exercise. The MEC would commission an information audit to evaluate the reliability and&#13;
quality of information in the system following its implementation.&#13;
Sub-Component: Development of a Student Assessment System&#13;
2.6   The on-going educational reform has stirred a keen interest in developing an&#13;
effective system for monitoring levels of student learning. Under the aegis of the National&#13;
System for Evaluation of the Education Process (Sistema Nacional de Evaluaci6n del&#13;
Proceso Educativo, SNEPE), the IDB and the Bank will jointly support the establishment&#13;
of a national student assessment system. The IDB will finance achievement tests at the&#13;
primary level, and the proposed project would support the assessments at the secondary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
education. Technical assistance and training requirements of SNEPE are to be shared&#13;
between the two projects.&#13;
2.7   The national assessment system would provide periodic, reliable and timely&#13;
information on student cognitive achievement, and would identify factors that can help&#13;
explain the differences in learning outcomes. Effective strategies for disseminating results&#13;
to the various targeted audiences would be implemented, including direct feedback to&#13;
schools and teachers, analysis of results for policy makers and the public in general. One&#13;
important focus of this feedback would be to orient the in-service teacher training&#13;
activities and content. Once census-based information is available, comparison of school&#13;
performance will identify critical areas to direct future MEC efforts. Furthermore, an&#13;
updated database of the results would be available for educational researchers.&#13;
2.8    The assessment system would measure learning in Spanish, Spanish literature,&#13;
Guarani, mathematics, natural sciences, and social studies, with an annual core of&#13;
mathematics and Spanish and rotating modules of the other subjects. The tests would be&#13;
criterion-referenced and would be administered to students at the final grade of the&#13;
educational cycles covered by the project (i.e., grades 9 and 12). During the&#13;
implementation of the proposed project, three sample-based administrations and one&#13;
census-based administration would be undertaken. In tandem, surveys for directors,&#13;
teachers and parents would be carried out. These surveys would provide information on&#13;
student background and school inputs and processes, so as to strengthen the policy&#13;
implications of the assessment data.&#13;
2.9    As the institutional home to SNEPE, the MEC's Department of Vocational and&#13;
Educational Orientation (Direcci6n de Orientacion Educacionaly Vocacional, DOEV)&#13;
would be responsible for the management of the system, including quality control, test&#13;
development and administration, and the dissemination and utilization of results. All&#13;
aspects related to data processing and analysis would be sub-contracted. The project&#13;
would finance technical assistance and training for DOEV's central unit in general skills&#13;
and in the design of test content at the secondary level, equipment and material needs, the&#13;
implementation of sample and census-based tests and dissemination of results. The&#13;
sustainability of the system would be furthered by the capacity-building activities, the&#13;
lower cost of a sample-based system, and the stimulation of demand for information. A&#13;
detailed description of component activities is found in Annex 4.&#13;
Sub-Component: Policy Studies, Research and Impact Evaluations&#13;
2.10  The objective of this sub-component is to build the foundations of a longer-term&#13;
education sector policy, and for secondary education in particular, based on the use of up-&#13;
to-date information, analytical rigor, dissemination and consensus-building. The sub-&#13;
component would adopt the following strategy: (a) ensure financing for a core set of&#13;
essential policy studies and technical support of particular relevance to the secondary level&#13;
and for evaluating the impacts of the project itself (para. 2.1 1); and (b) finance a number&#13;
of supplemental studies in areas of policy interest as determined based on the evolving&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
needs of the education sector (including primary, secondary, and tertiary). Through these&#13;
studies, the project would seek to leverage and coordinate other efforts to support the&#13;
development of sector policies and strategies. The studies and evaluations would provide&#13;
the foundations for the preparation of future Bank-assisted projects in the sector.&#13;
2.11   Areas of core policy studies include:&#13;
(a) internal and external needs of secondary education, including an evaluation&#13;
of the diversified Bachillerato, tracer studies of school leavers, labor market&#13;
analysis, and the implications of MERCOSUR for secondary education. This set&#13;
of analyses would allow for eventual revisions to the structure and curriculum of&#13;
the upper-secondary grades to bring it closer in line with the evolving skill needs of&#13;
the country'&#13;
(b) the education sector financing framework, including such issues as the&#13;
expansion of secondary school coverage, cost implications of the introduction of&#13;
compulsory and free basic education, and expenditure allocations between levels&#13;
and between the public and private sectors. This investigation would be carried&#13;
out jointly with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance in order to&#13;
plan for a rational expansion of educational opportunities and ensure an equitable&#13;
and efficient distribution of sector resources;&#13;
(c) status, organization and capacity of secondary school teachers, including&#13;
definition of classroom performance, future training needs, overall capacity of&#13;
teacher training institutions, and employment conditions. The recommendations&#13;
from these studies would be used to revise current teacher statutes, provide&#13;
feedback to future teacher training programs and identify policies and incentives&#13;
for improving teacher performance,&#13;
(d) technical support for defining education decentralization options. As such,&#13;
the project would finance the assistance of experts in the design and&#13;
implementation of decentralization strategies, bearing in mind that Paraguay has&#13;
recently begun to discuss the issue and many of the principal agents, such as&#13;
municipal and departmental governments, will require significant institutional&#13;
strengthening if they are to assume any responsibilities in the social sectors. This&#13;
support will provide a technical basis to the on-going political discussions around&#13;
decentralization, including information on international experience and assistance&#13;
in defining Paraguay's options over the medium and longer-terms; and&#13;
(e) evaluations of the impacts of the project, such as an evaluation of changes in&#13;
teaching practices in the classroom, the use and impact of textbooks at the&#13;
secondary level, and surveys on community participation in secondary education.&#13;
2.12  These core studies would be complemented with supplemental education research&#13;
proposals to be selected annually based on a competitive process to stimulate and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
strengthen the broader research community. All studies would be contracted out to&#13;
institutions, firms or individual consultants, with the MEC providing key information and&#13;
personnel, where appropriate, to facilitate analysis and the definition of recommendations.&#13;
In addition, the project would finance dissemination activities, including seminars to&#13;
present and discuss research results and the dissemination of approximately 5,000 reports.&#13;
The dissemination strategies would be oriented to the following audiences: (a) regarding&#13;
the core policy studies, results will be incorporated into the on-going development of&#13;
proposals to reorient secondary education, with particular emphasis on key policy-makers&#13;
within MEC management, the Education Reform Council and other agencies (e.g.&#13;
Ministry of Finance, universities); (b) regarding project impact evaluations, results would&#13;
be fed directly into training materials for teachers and school managers as well as the&#13;
appropriate MEC departments and teacher training institutes; and (c) regarding&#13;
supplemental research activities, dissemination would seek to strengthen the broader&#13;
research community, such as universities, NGOs, and ISE_&#13;
2.13  The PCU would be responsible for the technical management, contracting and&#13;
dissemination of these studies. The PCU would receive guidance from an ad-hoc Policy&#13;
and Research Committee chaired by the PCU Executive Coordinator and comprised of&#13;
members of the Education Reform Council, high-level MIEC management and other&#13;
institutions as appropriate. This committee would: (a) coordinate activities with other&#13;
institutions and programs, such as the 1995 agreement with Harvard Institute for&#13;
International Development (HIID) to provide policy training to MEC; (b) define technical&#13;
criteria for the selection and monitoring of the studies and evaluations; (c) review terms of&#13;
reference and intermediate products to ensure consistency with these criteria; (d)&#13;
recommend strategies for dissemination and application of the main findings; and (e)&#13;
manage activities related to supplemental research proposals, including definition of&#13;
priority topics, screening of proposals and review of final products. Establishment of the&#13;
Research Committee, through a ministerial resolution, is a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
Component 2: Provision of Textbooks, Educational Materials and&#13;
Curricular Support&#13;
2.14  The objective of the component is to improve the quality of secondary education&#13;
through the provision of better textbooks, educational materials and library materials to&#13;
enrich the learning environment, to improve teaching content and, ultimately, to increase&#13;
academic achievement and internal efficiency. In keeping with the Education Reform&#13;
agenda, the third cycle of basic education would be the principal target of interventions.&#13;
The MEC is currently designing the extension of curriculum reforms initiated at the&#13;
primary level to grades 7 - 9. Given the importance of the curriculum redesign for the&#13;
orientation and content of textbooks and other educational materials to be developed&#13;
under the component, as a condition of disbursement against textbooks, the MEC will&#13;
prepare, validate and furnish to the Bank a new curriculum and lesson plans (guidelines)&#13;
for grades 7 - 9. To carry out this review, a team of national and international experts will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
evaluate the proposed curriculum and assist the MEC in refining the final version based on&#13;
the on-going experience of implementation of the new curriculum in the earlier grades.&#13;
2.15  Provision of Textbooks. The project would support the production and&#13;
distribution of textbooks in the core skill areas of mathematics, Spanish, and natural&#13;
sciences for public school students in each year of the third cycle of basic education.&#13;
Based on enrollment projections, about 866,835 textbooks would be procured during the&#13;
project. The initial delivery of textbooks is scheduled for the 1998 academic year,&#13;
following the implementation plan of the revised curriculum. This schedule allows for&#13;
sufficient time to carry out preparation activities, including development of technical and&#13;
pedagogical specifications and selection criteria, carrying out of the public bidding&#13;
process, and incorporation of teacher preferences.&#13;
2.16  Building on the recent experience with procurement of textbooks at the primary&#13;
level, a two-step international bidding process is envisioned whereby the MEC would&#13;
solicit texts in the three main subject areas from the private editorial and publishing sector.&#13;
The project would support training for the technical staff of the Department of Curriculum&#13;
in the design and content of textbooks in order to improve the ability of the MEC to select&#13;
high-quality texts. Technical evaluation of bid proposals would be carried out by&#13;
committees comprised of Curriculum Department specialists, representatives from other&#13;
MEC departments, and teachers with classroom functions in the appropriate grades from&#13;
both rural and urban areas. These committees, one for each subject area, would use&#13;
selection criteria and checklists developed during project preparation and would ensure&#13;
conformity between the textbooks and the revised curriculum. Textbooks would be&#13;
delivered pre-packaged to the existing MEC storage facilities. The project would finance&#13;
the distribution of textbooks to schools. The mechanism to be used will be based on a&#13;
market study of private distribution services available at the national and local levels, and&#13;
an evaluation of the on-going experience of the MEC with direct distribution of primary&#13;
level textbooks using MEC and other public sector infrastructure and logistical support.&#13;
2.17  At the school-level, textbooks would be made available for each student's use and&#13;
distributed free of charge, in keeping with the Education Reform objectives for the basic&#13;
education cycle. However, to promote respect for textbooks, students who lose or ruin&#13;
their books would be responsible for the full cost of replacement. To address the issue of&#13;
longer-term sustainability of textbook financing after completion of the project, the project&#13;
would support the design of a mechanism to finance the acquisition and distribution of&#13;
textbooks once the project ends, including potential contributions from parents'&#13;
associations, the National Treasury and, eventually, support from regional and municipal&#13;
governments and NGOs. The project would support the definition of the legal,&#13;
administrative, financial and targeting aspects of this mechanism, which for the third cycle&#13;
of basic education is estimated to need on average US$600,000 per year. Parents&#13;
currently spend about US$2 per student per year on photocopies, or US$425,000 for all&#13;
public secondary school students, which would no longer be necessary with sufficient&#13;
supply of texts and educational materials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
2.18  Establishment of Classroom and School Libraries. The component would&#13;
support the establishment and upgrading of classroom and school libraries as a means of&#13;
building reading habits, enriching basic communications skills, stimulating interest in study&#13;
and research, and expanding access to basic information. The project would provide for&#13;
600 basic classroom libraries (80 volumes of texts, reference books, and specialized&#13;
books) and 200 upgraded libraries (up to fifty volumes to complement existing stocks) in&#13;
secondary schools. The project would finance training for school librarians, teachers and&#13;
students to promote the flil use, maintenance and updating of this resource.&#13;
2.19  Supply of Complementary Educational Materials. The component would also&#13;
finance a package of basic materials for 800 public secondary school to support the new&#13;
curriculum for the third cycle of basic education. Equipment purchases, particularly&#13;
related to the teaching of natural sciences, will be determined based on criteria of cost&#13;
(purchase, installation, maintenance, training of users, consumable inputs, and spare parts),&#13;
simplicity of design and operation, relevance to the curriculum, availability of local&#13;
materials, and flexibility in use.&#13;
2.20  Support for Departmental Pedagogical Units. This component would also&#13;
support basic teacher training reference materials and equipment for the MEC's eighteen&#13;
Departmental Pedagogical Units (Unidad Pedag6gica Departamental, UPD), including:&#13;
high-quality reference materials on curricula, teaching methods, evaluation methodology,&#13;
educational psychology and related topics, reference books in the core skill areas, samples&#13;
of teaching materials from other countries, and technical slides and videos. These&#13;
materials would reinforce close coordination between the provision of teaching inputs and&#13;
the training of teaching staff in their use.&#13;
2.21   Support to the Department of Curriculum. The project would provide training,&#13;
technical assistance and basic equipment to the Department of Curriculum to develop its&#13;
Learning Resources Division. This unit would functions as: (a) a normative body, to&#13;
establish, communicate, and monitor compliance with quality standards for texts and&#13;
educational materials in order to increase the quality of materials and to send signals to&#13;
textbook authors and publishers to improve materials available in the local market; (b) a&#13;
clearing house for dissemination of new materials and innovations, particularly to support&#13;
departments carrying out training activities; and (c) as a coordination mechanism between&#13;
UPDs, universities and teacher training institutes. The project would finance specialized&#13;
technical assistance and training in the areas of: general curriculum development, core skill&#13;
areas, development of selection criteria and quality standards for textbooks and&#13;
educational materials, methodologies for evaluating use and impact of educational&#13;
materials, and design and use of mini-laboratories for science experiments. Annex 5&#13;
provides further details of component implementation.&#13;
Component 3: Training for Teachers and School Managers&#13;
2.22  The general objectives of the component are to: (a) raise the quality and&#13;
effectiveness of teaching in the classroom; (b) promote the effective use of didactic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
materials provided through the project; (c) stimulate more efficient and participatory&#13;
management of schools; and (d) strengthen the MEC's capacity to carry-out activities&#13;
related to in-service teacher training and training for school managers. The&#13;
implementation of the component would be based on a decentralized strategy oriented to&#13;
school- and locally-based training. The component has two areas of emphasis: teacher&#13;
training to improve instruction techniques, and training in school management with school&#13;
principals, supervisors and school-based community associations, as described in Annex 6.&#13;
2.23  Teacher Training. The main objectives of teacher training are to disseminate key&#13;
principles of the Educational Reform program, to implement curriculum reforms in grades&#13;
7-9, and to improve teaching techniques based on the new textbooks and other materials&#13;
to be provided. Teacher training would be delivered through school-based workshops.&#13;
The first stage would be closely related to the use of the educational materials to be&#13;
furnished under the project, including textbooks and teaching guides, library and other&#13;
educational materials. This training would be carried out in all 800 schools receiving these&#13;
inputs. This first experience will reinforce the schools' initiative to enroll in a second&#13;
phase of continuous training related to improving teaching methods and content&#13;
specifically in the areas of Spanish, mathematics and basic sciences. This second phase&#13;
would be targeted to schools which display priority needs for quality enhancements.&#13;
2.24  Training in School Management. The objective of training in school&#13;
management would be to promote efficient and effective management of secondary&#13;
schools in areas related to administration, organization of the learning environment, and&#13;
community participation. Training activities would apply to three groups:&#13;
(a) supervisors, pedagogic coordinators, evaluators and other specialized professionals at&#13;
the department or school zone level, (b) secondary school principals and their non-&#13;
teaching staff; and (c) members of parents' associations. For the first two groups, training&#13;
content would include: (a) orientation in the Education Reform objectives and&#13;
methodology; (b) curriculum content and its application in study plans and classroom&#13;
sessions; (c) school administration, including guidelines and procedures for managing&#13;
financial, human and physical resources; (d) optimal use, conservation and cost recovery&#13;
mechanisms for educational materials; and (e) guidelines and procedures for increasing the&#13;
participation of teachers, students and parents in school management.&#13;
2.25  Training and orientation for parents' associations would build on the existing&#13;
experience of parents' associations and would seek to involve the community more deeply&#13;
in the school environment. Part of the training would be focused on strengthening the&#13;
parents' associations themselves, through guidance in how to manage resources effectively&#13;
and other organizational issues. The training would also inform parents' associations about&#13;
the Education Reform program, goals of the education system, and information regarding&#13;
school performance. Finally, the training would seek to better integrate these associations&#13;
into the planning and monitoring functions of the school. Activities would include&#13;
information campaigns via mass media, assemblies with representatives of parents'&#13;
associations and workshops at the school level. The training activities would be organized&#13;
by a central team from key MEC departments and executed at the regional level by an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
outreach team of social promoters. To this end, during project preparation a cooperation&#13;
agreement was signed with UNICEF for its technical support to develop training&#13;
materials, define selection criteria for promoters, and support dissemination.&#13;
2.26  The project would finance the production and distribution of training and&#13;
informational materials, technical assistance, seminars on selected topics to incorporate&#13;
national and international experience into the on-going training efforts, and equipment and&#13;
materials to strengthen the capacity to manage the program. The component would&#13;
provide for training of about 75 training specialists at the central and regional levels, about&#13;
240 secondary-level supervisors and specialized staff, and 1,110 school directors,&#13;
orientation in the application of the revised curriculum and use of educational materials to&#13;
about 10,000 teachers, upgrading of teaching skills in mathematics, science and Spanish&#13;
for about 6,000 secondary-level teachers, training of 2,400 members of parents'&#13;
associations, and preparation of materials to promote participation of over 150,000&#13;
parents in school activities.&#13;
2.27  Institutional Framework. The institutional framework for teacher training&#13;
divides functions among the national, regional and school levels. To implement the above&#13;
strategy, the MEC central-level agencies will be strengthened to play a more strategic role&#13;
in coordinating this multi-level system. This institutional framework is consistent with the&#13;
National System for Teacher Training (Sistema Nacional de Actualizaci6n Docente,&#13;
SINAD) currently under implementation with the IDB-financed primary education project.&#13;
As such, the Department of Teacher Training (Departamento de Formaci6n Docente -&#13;
DFD) and the Instituto Superior de Educaci6n (ISE) will be the national agencies&#13;
responsible for establishing guidelines and overseeing the execution of the training&#13;
program. A Technical Unit for Teacher Training (Unidad Tecnica de Actualizaci6n&#13;
Docente, UTAD) would be established within the DFD, directly responsible for the&#13;
design, execution and evaluation of the program. This central team would work with the&#13;
18 departmental training teams (UPDs) being conformed under SINAD and consisting of&#13;
a small number of high-level professionals. These UPDs would coordinate the training&#13;
activities at the regional level and identify local networks of training resource people&#13;
within educational institutions. Supervisors and school directors would be responsible for&#13;
organizing on-going school-based workshops to deliver this training. Training in school&#13;
management would use the same system, with the exception of the activities related to&#13;
parent's associations.&#13;
Component 4: Infrastructure Upgrading and Expansion&#13;
2.28  The availability and quality of school infrastructure are factors in low secondary&#13;
education quality and coverage. The cost estimates of infrastructure needs to the year&#13;
2000 are provided in Table 2.1. The component would finance rehabilitation, substitution&#13;
and the construction of new classrooms and support facilities, as well as provision of basic&#13;
furniture and equipment, focused principally on the lower secondary level (grades 7-9), in&#13;
keeping with the priorities of the Government. In those cases where the primary and&#13;
secondary levels share infrastructure, investments would be coordinated with the IDB&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
primary education project. Annex 7 presents details of the infrastructure program and&#13;
enrollment projections.&#13;
Table 2.1: Summary of Secondary Education Infrastructure Requirements&#13;

Total Range  US$75 - 123m&#13;
2.29  Eligibility criteria for school selection include: (a) an increase in enrollment by at&#13;
least five percent between 1993-94 or other verification of sufficient student demand, (b)&#13;
property title in the name of either the central or municipal governments (or proof that the&#13;
title transfer process is underway), (c) existence of a formal parents' association&#13;
recognized by ministerial decree, (d) a student body from a low-income population, and&#13;
(e) physical conditions that allow for complementary works and expanded classroom&#13;
space. The school mapping exercise currently underway with IDB financing will update&#13;
this information. Target geographical resource allocations between departments are based&#13;
on the 1992 Census population share. Poverty targeting at the local level will be carried&#13;
out with assistance from a poverty map of unmet basic needs currently being developed by&#13;
the General Office of Statistics and Census.&#13;
2.30  Parents' associations would be actively involved in the infrastructure program&#13;
building on the already good results in this area. Contracting of civil works would be&#13;
carried out either through parents' associations or through private contractors, depending&#13;
on the scale of the investment and the economic and management requirements. Both&#13;
methods are routinely used by the MEC. To avoid creating disincentives for community&#13;
participation all infrastructure works would require cost sharing with parents'&#13;
associations, either in cash or in-kind contributions of labor and materials. Works to be&#13;
done on school are divided into two types: (a) 'pre-selected' secondary schools which&#13;
would include minor and major rehabilitation, substitution and construction of new&#13;
classrooms and other facilities (library, sanitary facilities and administrative office); and (b)&#13;
community-generated demands for construction of new classrooms on a 50-50 cost-&#13;
sharing arrangement as currently is the practice in the MEC. Regarding (a), individual&#13;
schools would be selected annually based on the priorities presented in para. 2.29 above.&#13;
Rehabilitation would be carried out first through cost-sharing with parents' associations.&#13;
Once completed, private contractors would be used to complete the major works in these&#13;
'model' schools. Parents' associations would share the costs of all exterior works (access&#13;
paths, drainage canals, perimeter walls). At present, maintenance of physical facilities is&#13;
the responsibility of the school level, carried out through school fees and community&#13;
contributions. MEC would provide an initial stock of minor equipment and supplies under&#13;
a cost sharing agreement with the school, supervised by the parents' associations. During&#13;
project preparation, a draft Maintenance Manual was developed to serve as a reference&#13;
guide for these associations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
2.31   For those works carried out by parents' associations, the Department of Social&#13;
Action would process requests, and the Department of School Construction would&#13;
evaluate the technical proposals and supervise construction activities. For each civil&#13;
works contract, a Cost-Sharing Agreement would be signed between the MEC and the&#13;
parent's association reflecting the total value of the work to be carried out, including the&#13;
specified community contributions. Administrative oversight and auditing would be&#13;
carried out by the MEC's Intemal Audit Department. During execution of works, support&#13;
from the community in labor and materials would be verified vis-a-vis the initial contract.&#13;
Technical supervision would be financed for each contract to provide quality control and&#13;
technical assistance during the construction period.&#13;
2.32  The proposed project would finance an estimated 600 new classrooms to be&#13;
constructed through parents' associations on the demand-driven system. The 144&#13;
institutional renovations of pre-selected schools would include rehabilitation and&#13;
construction of classrooms and other facilities.9 Basic furniture would be provided to all&#13;
rehabilitated and new classrooms. The overall investment would allow for an incremental&#13;
46,032 student places. Assuming two shifts, this investment would raise the enrollment&#13;
rate for grades 7-9 from 45 percent at present to 56 percent by the year 2000.&#13;
2.33   The MEC would ensure that incremental teachers' positions would be assigned to&#13;
any new classrooms constructed under the project. The natural growth of the system&#13;
(crecimiento vegetativo) is routinely budgeted for in the annual negotiations between the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and the MEC. To the extent that the project would finance a net&#13;
increase in coverage, these additional resources will need to be provided for through a&#13;
combination of internal efficiency and reallocation within the MEC budget and increased&#13;
resources allocated to the sector (para. 3.8). This component builds in flexibility in the&#13;
distribution of project resources between rehabilitation, substitution and new classroom&#13;
construction based on the absorptive capacity of the sector.&#13;
2.34  The project would also provide institutional strengthening to the MEC's School&#13;
Construction Department. Incremental technical support including a program manager,&#13;
technical specialists, and supervisors would be contracted in accordance with the work&#13;
load of the Department. In addition, technical assistance would be provided in&#13;
methodologies and mechanisms for micro-level planning of school infrastructure.&#13;
Component 5: Pilot Program for School-Based Innovations&#13;
2.35   The objective of this component is to promote greater local participation in finding&#13;
solutions for low school productivity. Grant-based financing for sub-projects would be&#13;
awarded on a competitive basis for those demand-driven initiatives designed to increase&#13;
learning and improve school performance. These initiatives would address educational&#13;
9 Standard designs and unit cost estimates were developed during project preparation. In addition, field&#13;
work carried out on a sample of 40 secondary schools generated estimates for average cost of&#13;
rehabilitation and substitution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
issues clearly related with students learning needs in the core curriculum subjects, building&#13;
on the on-going experience with similar programs in the Region (Chile, Brazil, Uruguay).&#13;
A major portion of resources would be reserved for innovative proposals from eligible&#13;
schools which display priority needs for quality enhancements, and a minor proportion of&#13;
resources for the remaining eligible schools. The support would be used for activities not&#13;
included under other project components.&#13;
2.36  As a pilot, this component would be implemented during the latter part of the&#13;
proposed project. The activities of the other components (school-based training,&#13;
provision of educational materials and curriculum development) would set the basis for the&#13;
preparation of the pilot. In 1997 and 1998 (the second and third year of the proposed&#13;
project) technical assistance would be contracted to assist in establishing the guidelines for&#13;
the operation of the pilot program, including: (a) institutional arrangements for execution;&#13;
(b) definition of eligible schools; (c) identification of sub-project award criteria; (d)&#13;
definition of mechanisms for disseminating information about the program; and (e) training&#13;
of those responsible for program execution. Execution of the first sub-projects would&#13;
begin in the second semester of 1998. It is expected that 200 schools would benefit&#13;
during the pilot program, receiving grants on average of US$4,000. The phasing in of this&#13;
program reflects implementation capacity considerations of the MEC and the sequencing&#13;
of key project activities. As a condition of disbursement for this program, operating&#13;
procedures and selection criteria would be presented to and agreed with the Bank.&#13;
3. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
A. Project Costs&#13;
3.1   Total project costs, including physical and price contingencies, are estimated at&#13;
US$40.5 million. Table 3.1 summarizes the estimated project costs by component. Annex&#13;
8 provides a further breakdown of project costs by expenditure category.&#13;
3.2   Base Costs. Base costs are estimated at US$35.7 million and are expressed in&#13;
November 1994 prices. Estimated costs of civil works and school furniture were based on&#13;
prevailing market prices. Estimated costs of equipment, vehicles and office furniture&#13;
were based on prices of similar imported or locally available items. Estimated costs of&#13;
teacher training, operating costs and educational, training, and dissemination materials&#13;
were based on recent price quotations, past experience, and expert opinion. Costs for&#13;
overseas and domestic training were based on prevailing standards. All recurrent costs&#13;
were based on current MEC budget items.&#13;
3.3   Contingencies. Total contingencies amount to US$4.9 million (12 percent of&#13;
total project costs), of which US$2.6 million for physical contingencies and US$2.3&#13;
million for price contingencies. Physical contingencies were applied to base costs as&#13;
follows: 10 percent for civil works; 5 percent for consulting services, equipment,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
furniture, training, school-based grants, operating costs, educational, training, and&#13;
dissemination materials and recurrent costs; and 0 percent for vehicles. Price&#13;
contingencies were applied based on Bank estimates of foreign and local inflation rates.&#13;

3.4    Foreign Exchange. The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$11.9&#13;
million, or 29 percent of total project cost. Foreign exchange estimates were based on the&#13;
following percentages of base costs: 100 percent for international consulting contracts; 90&#13;
percent for library materials; 80 percent for equipment and vehicles; 70 percent for&#13;
fuirniture; 65 percent for non-printed materials; 50 percent for other printed materials; 33&#13;
percent for textbooks; 20 percent for civil works; 10 percent for training; and 0 percent&#13;
for local consultants, school-based grants, operating and recurrent costs.&#13;
3.5    Taxes and Duties. Local taxes and duties amount to approximately US$3.3&#13;
million, or 8 percent of total project costs. Locally procured goods and services are&#13;
subject to a value-added tax (VAT) of 10 percent, excluding computers and related&#13;
equipment (VAT-exempt). Import duties for computers are about 6 percent, 10 percent&#13;
for vehicles, 30 percent for furniture and, on average, 10 percent for other equipment.&#13;
Duties on textbooks and library/educational materials are zero.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. Financing Plan&#13;
3.6    A proposed Bank loan of US$24.5 million would finance 60 percent of total&#13;
project costs, or 66 percent net of duties and taxes. Bank financing would cover 100&#13;
percent of foreign exchange expenditures and 50 percent of local currency expenditures&#13;
net of taxes. Contributions from communities channeled through parents' associations&#13;
would amount to US$4. I million or 10 percent of total project costs. The Government&#13;
would finance the remaining US$11.9 million, or 30 percent of project costs. The&#13;
Government counterpart requirement represents about one percent of the current MEC&#13;
budget on an annualized basis. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the&#13;
Government on the overall amount, budgeting and disbursement mechanisms to ensure&#13;
timely provision of counterpart resources. As a condition of effectiveness, the&#13;
Government would confirm the inclusion of the appropriate level of counterpart funding&#13;
within the 1996 national budget submitted for Congressional approval. The&#13;
Implementation Letter of the Loan Agreement includes annual estimates of counterpart&#13;
requirements to expedite the planning and approval of the annual government&#13;
contribution. The actual disbursement of counterpart funds would be confirmed through&#13;
the annual independent audits (para. 3.18) and monitored on an on-going basis with&#13;
support from the Bank's Facilitating Office in Asuncion. The loan would be a fixed-rate&#13;
US dollar single currency loan for up to 15 years. Each semester's aggregate&#13;
disbursements (Disbursed Amount) will have a grace period of three years and a final&#13;
maturity of nine years from the rate fixing date of that Disbursed Amount.'° The interest&#13;
payment dates and rate fixing dates are June 15 and December 15, respectively. The&#13;
financing plan is presented in Table 3.2, with further details provided in Annex 8.&#13;

C. Recurrent Costs&#13;
3.7    Recurrent costs related to project execution and incorporated within the financing&#13;
plan include: (a) incremental MEC salaries and overtime payments to support the&#13;
implementation of project activities (US$ 1.1 million); (b) maintenance of vehicles and&#13;
'° The Borrower has selected fixed rate US dollar single currency loan terms in order to improve the&#13;
management of its external liabilities and reduce its risks. The choice of US dollar terms reflects the&#13;
importance of the US and US dollar-based contracts in Paraguay's international trade and Treasury&#13;
receipts. The Government considers a fixed interest rate appropriate for the diversification of its&#13;
interest rate risk and management of the repayment stream.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
equipment (US$0.25 million); and (c) maintenance of civil works and school furniture&#13;
(US$0.50 million). None of these recurrent costs would be Bank-financed. Communities&#13;
would share the costs of school maintenance with the MEC, either through donated labor,&#13;
materials or financial contributions channeled through parents' organizations. The MEC&#13;
would fully finance the incremental salaries and maintenance of vehicles and equipment&#13;
through the counterpart financing requirements of the project.&#13;
3.8   In addition to the recurrent costs identified within the financing plan, during&#13;
negotiations, it was agreed that adequate teaching positions would be assigned by MEC to&#13;
any new classroom constructed under the project. The hiring of new teachers to staff&#13;
these classrooms would be financed from three potential sources: (a) additional resources&#13;
from the Treasury through the annual budget allocation process; (b) increased efficiency&#13;
within the education sector, in particular from incremental resources freed up through the&#13;
potential gains already identified within the personnel system; and (c) parents' financing of&#13;
teachers' salaries, on a temporary basis awaiting absorption within the MEC budget, as is&#13;
currently a common practice in many highly motivated but undeserved communities.&#13;
Based on the planned infrastructure program, the new classrooms to be constructed during&#13;
the proposed project would generate, by the year 2001, between US$5 million and US$1 I&#13;
million annually in operating costs (depending on number of shifts), equivalent to between&#13;
2 and 4 percent of the 1994 MEC budget. To ensure that classroom construction keeps&#13;
pace with the absorptive capacity of the training and financing of teachers, the program&#13;
would be reviewed annually as to the mix of rehabilitation, substitution and new classroom&#13;
construction. No later that September 30 of each year, the Government would present an&#13;
action plan for implementation during the following year, satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
including a list of expected teaching positions to be assigned to new classrooms to be&#13;
constructed under the project during that year, and the amount of funds necessary to hire&#13;
these positions. In addition, the policy research on the education sector financing&#13;
framework (para. 2.11) to be undertaken during the project will update the recurrent cost&#13;
projections and reconfirm the absorptive capacity of the MEC for the investments planned&#13;
during the later years of project implementation.&#13;
D. Economic Analysis&#13;
3.9   At US$190, the total investment per student is in line with the scale of investment&#13;
per student in other Bank-financed secondary education projects in the Region, such as&#13;
Colombia (US$100 per student) and Jamaica (US$174), and generally lower than Bank-&#13;
financed investments in the higher-income LAC countries of Chile (US$317 per student)&#13;
and Argentina (US$355 weighted average of participating provinces). Although an&#13;
economic rate of return is generally not applicable to this type of project, empirical results&#13;
of the links between education and earnings do point to acceptable levels of both private&#13;
and social rates of return for individuals which complete their secondary education (para.&#13;
1.33). To date, this analysis has been limited to the Greater Asuncion area. Results from&#13;
the first national-level household survey to be carried out in 1995 will permit estimation of&#13;
these indicators on a national level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
3.10  In the absence of sufficient data and methodological limitations, economic&#13;
appraisal of the project has focused on unit-cost analysis. Within the infrastructure&#13;
program, unit costs have been optimized through: (a) the consideration of different&#13;
architectural models to assess the cost implications of such facilities as laboratories, multi-&#13;
use spaces and libraries'" and (b) the cost implications of alternative delivery systems.&#13;
Regarding the latter, past MEC experience revealed significant reductions in unit costs of&#13;
construction carried out through parents' associations compared with contracted firms,&#13;
although quality is an issue in some cases. Adjusting for appropriate technical support and&#13;
supervision, the unit costs of civil works to be carried out by parents' associations under&#13;
the project are estimated at two-thirds of the cost of using private contractors. Under the&#13;
teacher training program, the option of school-based workshops offers significant unit cost&#13;
savings from the alternative of large-scale displacement of teachers to centrally-based&#13;
training facilities as has been the practice in the past in Paraguay. For the investments in&#13;
textbooks and other teaching materials, analysis of existing market structure and unit costs&#13;
were used to estimate a cost per textbook of US$3.30. International competitive bidding&#13;
procedures will be used to procure textbooks and other educational materials in order to&#13;
promote cost control and expand access to lower-cost supplies outside of the limited&#13;
national market. Measures of cost effectiveness of these interventions are not available at&#13;
this time. The project would finance a student assessment system which will permit an&#13;
identification of key inputs and the benefits of selected investments in the future.&#13;
E. Procurement Arrangements&#13;
3.11   The PCU would be responsible for procurement under the project. Procurement&#13;
of civil works and goods subject to Bank financing would be carried out in accordance&#13;
writh Bank guidelines (January 1995), and for services, Bank guidelines for the use of&#13;
consultants (August 1981). Based on a January 1992 Bank review of Paraguayan&#13;
procurement practices, there are several discrepancies between local and Bank procedures.&#13;
In recent Bank-financed projects, these differences have been resolved by using standard&#13;
documents, provided that the Loan Agreement contained specific mention of each item,&#13;
for the procurement of civil works, goods and/or consulting services (see Annex 9). The&#13;
Loan Agreement, according to the Comptroller General of the Nation (CGN), prevails&#13;
over local legislation. Table 3.3 summarizes proposed procurement arrangements.&#13;
3.12  Procurement methods would require documents and procedures as follows:&#13;
(a)   International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would require the use of Bank-issued&#13;
standard bidding documents, which are mandatory. Under ICB, domestic&#13;
preference may be applied, in accordance with Bank guidelines for the&#13;
procurement of goods;&#13;
"Such analysis led to the decision to work with modular science kits for grades 7-9, consideration of&#13;
multi-use spaces only in selected cases and a preference for library and study space.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
(b)      Limited International Bidding (LIB) would be carried out for procurement of&#13;
selected goods and equipment using Bank-issued standard ICB documents&#13;
modified as necessary for LIB,&#13;

documents were agreed upon at negotiations;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
(d)   National and international shopping procedures for the procurement of goods&#13;
would be carried out according to procedures acceptable to the Bank which&#13;
require a minimum of three price quotations obtained from eligible suppliers;&#13;
(e)   Lump-sum, fixed-price contracts would be used for the procurement of small&#13;
works and awarded on the basis of comparison of at least three qualified&#13;
contractors;&#13;
(f)    Direct contracting with communities may be allowed in selected cases of small-&#13;
scale civil works executed by parents' associations with donated or self-financed&#13;
unskilled labor inputs or local materials, as stipulated in para. 3.15 of the January&#13;
1995 Guidelines. A standard contract between the MEC and parents' associations&#13;
for the contracting of such civil works was agreed upon at negotiations; and&#13;
(g)   Contracting of consultants would use the standard contract based on the Bank&#13;
Standard Form of Contract and the standard letter of invitation agreed upon at&#13;
negotiations;&#13;
(h)   A procurement plan, as contained in the project's Administrative Manual (para.&#13;
4.3), reviewed during negotiations, with annual adjustments to be carried out&#13;
through the Annual Implementation Plan (para. 4.4).&#13;
3.13  In addition to these general requirements, procurement subject to Bank financing would&#13;
comply with the following specifications per category:&#13;
(a)   Civil Works. For the contracting of civil works, the following thresholds would&#13;
apply per amount of contract: (i) above US$2 million - ICB, although because of&#13;
the small size of civil works contracts, relatively dispersed nature of the schools&#13;
affected, and projected annual amounts of the construction program, no individual&#13;
contracts are expected over US$2 million; (ii) more that US$75,000 and less than&#13;
US$2 million - NCB, with a total expected amount of US$10.3 million&#13;
representing 54 percent of the civil works contracts to be financed through the&#13;
proposed project; (iii) contracts US$75,000 or less would be lump-sum, fixed-&#13;
price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations from at least three qualified&#13;
contractors; and (iv) for contracts US$25,000 or less (including value of&#13;
community contribution), direct contracting through parents' associations may be&#13;
allowed. The aggregate limit for civil works procured through lump-sum, fixed-&#13;
price contracts would be US$0.5 million. The aggregate limit for civil works&#13;
procured through direct contracting would be US$8.3 million.&#13;
(b)   Textbooks. The procurement of textbooks would be carried out through ICB in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines and using Bank-issued Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents for Textbooks. A two-stage process would be used. First, bidding&#13;
documents will be issued, requesting technical proposals only. Second, a short list&#13;
of qualifying bidders will be invited to submit new technical and economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
proposals, revised according to the recommendations of the technical evaluation.&#13;
The contract would include pre-packaged delivery to the MEC's warehouse.&#13;
Delivery expenses to the school-level would be procured as operating costs in the&#13;
case of distribution through the existing MEC and parents' association channels or&#13;
through competitively contracted private services (para. 2.16).&#13;
(c)   Goods and Equipment. 12 Contracts valued at more than US$250,000 per&#13;
contract would be awarded through ICB, including school furniture (US$1.8&#13;
million), science kits (US$1.35 million) and library materials (US$1.35 million).&#13;
To ensure effective cost control and access to competition by smaller-scale&#13;
national producers, the ICB for school furniture would be structured in packages&#13;
of regional lots. NCB procedures would be used for contracts estimated to cost&#13;
US$250,000 or less but more than US$50,000, up to an aggregate limit of US$0.7&#13;
million. National and international shopping procedures would apply for all&#13;
contracts valued at US$50,000 or less, up to an aggregate limit of US$1.3 million.&#13;
For vehicles (US$0.21 million) and for computer-related equipment and&#13;
photocopiers (US$0.45 million) in packages of over US$50,000, limited&#13;
international bidding (LIB) procedures would apply. For packages estimated to&#13;
cost US$50,000 or less, national shopping procedures would be used, with the&#13;
aggregate limit included above.&#13;
(d)   School-Based Innovation Sub-Projects. Under a pilot program, grant financing&#13;
(average size US$4,000) would be awarded to schools presenting winning&#13;
proposals in project competitions. Any equipment and materials to be purchased&#13;
per sub-project estimated to cost the equivalent of US$5,000 or less per contract,&#13;
up to an aggregate amount equivalent to US$900,000, for which at least three&#13;
price quotations cannot be obtained, may be procured by direct contracting in&#13;
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(e)   Categories Not Applicable to Procurement Arrangements. Standard&#13;
procurement arrangements would not apply to operating expenses and training&#13;
costs (rent, utilities, travel, per diems, communications, etc. though any minor&#13;
office and training supplies would be purchased using shopping procedures), nor&#13;
would they apply to expenditures not financed by the Bank.&#13;
3.14  Prior Review. Prior review would be required for: (a) all contracts procured&#13;
through ICB and LIB; and (b) all NCB contracts for goods and works. About 54 percent&#13;
of the total estimated value of civil works and 88 percent of goods and equipment&#13;
(including textbooks) would be subject to Bank prior review. The Bank requires a no&#13;
objection on all terms of reference for consulting services. Prior review of candidates and&#13;
hiring procedures would apply to contracts with firms for US$20,000 or more and&#13;
contracts with individuals for US$5,000 or more. In addition, the Bank requires prior&#13;

and other equipment. See Annex 9 for details on expected distribution of goods and equipment by&#13;
procurement method.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
review of all PCU positions. All other contracts would be subject to post-review by the&#13;
Bank in the course of supervision. School-based grants, operating costs and training&#13;
expenditures are not subject to prior review. Nonetheless, to ensure effective use of these&#13;
categories of financing, the Annual Implementation Plan (para. 4.5) would include a&#13;
schedule of planned training activities and a quarterly budget for operating costs. Annex 9&#13;
presents a summary table of procurement arrangements.&#13;
F. Disbursements and Accounts&#13;
3.15  Loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed (in accordance with the schedule&#13;
shown in Annex 10) over five years, which is shorter than the average for Paraguay (7.5&#13;
years) and for education projects in the LAC region (7.5 years). This shorter than usual&#13;
disbursement period, in keeping with the consensus at the IEPS stage, reflects: (a)&#13;
intentional project design focused on keeping project objectives modest and building the&#13;
analytical, policy and implementation foundations for future Bank support to selected&#13;
policy initiatives and new investment areas, (b) creation of implementation capacity during&#13;
project preparation to permit more dynamic start-up than is usual for projects in Paraguay;&#13;
and (c) the high Government priority given the education sector and the project. Based on&#13;
recent Bank experience with projects approved in Paraguay, including the Congressional&#13;
ratification process, project effectiveness is expected for May 31, 1996, which would&#13;
result in a project completion date of June 30, 2001 and a closing date of December 31,&#13;
2001. Table 3.4 shows the estimated Bank loan disbursement schedule and Table 3.5 the&#13;
allocation and disbursement categories for Loan proceeds.&#13;

3.16  Disbursements would be made on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOE)&#13;
for all expenses except those covered by contracts requiring prior Bank review. Full&#13;
documentation would therefore be required of: (a) civil works contracts over US$75,000,&#13;
(b) goods and equipment (including textbooks) contracts over US$50,000, and (c)&#13;
consultant service contracts with firms over US$20,000 and individuals over US$5,000.&#13;
Additionally, all expenditures made on operating costs, training and school-based grants&#13;
would be made against SOEs. Documentation of these expenditures would not be&#13;
submitted to the Bank but instead retained by the PCU for periodic inspection by Bank&#13;
staff and for audit purposes.&#13;
3.17  Special Account. To ensure efficient and timely project implementation, the&#13;
Borrower would open a Special Account in the Central Bank of Paraguay, under terms&#13;
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The authorized allocation to this account would&#13;
be US$1.6 million, equal to the average of four months' eligible expenditures (net of&#13;
anticipated direct payments). An initial deposit of up to US$500,000 will be made&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
available and the full amount of the authorized allocation will be released when&#13;
disbursements reach a level of US$2 million. Funds from the account will finance only the&#13;
Bank's share of eligible expenditures. The Bank will replenish the Special Account as&#13;
requested upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that expenditures paid were eligible for&#13;
financing out of the account.&#13;

G. Audits&#13;
3.18  The project would finance an independent auditor with qualifications acceptable to&#13;
the Bank to: (a) audit all accounts, SOEs and Special Accounts; (b) apply auditing&#13;
standards and procedures satisfactory to the Bank, (c) carry out its auditing work in a&#13;
timely manner so that an annual report would be presented no later than six months after&#13;
the end of each fiscal year; and (d) render an audit opinion or the reasons why such an&#13;
opinion cannot be rendered. With respect to SOEs, the auditors' reports would include an&#13;
opinion on the methods employed in compiling the SOEs, the relevance of supporting&#13;
documents, their eligibility for financing with loan proceeds, and the standards of record-&#13;
keeping and internal controls related to the foregoing. The MEC would also contract&#13;
independent physical audits of civil works and major purchases of goods. Draft terms of&#13;
reference for the independent financial audits were presented at negotiations, and&#13;
assurances obtained that the auditing arrangements would conform with these terms.&#13;
&#13;

4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Status of Preparation&#13;
4.1   The proposed project was initially identified in May 1992. Due to institutional&#13;
capacity constraints on initiating both the primary and secondary education projects at the&#13;
same time, it was agreed to sequence processing, with the five-year primary education&#13;
project coming on stream in mid- 1994. After the change in government, the proposed&#13;
project objectives and content were reconfirmed with the new MEC authorities in&#13;
September 1993 and preparation activities began.&#13;
4.2   Preparation has been supported through a PHRD Japanese Grant to finance project&#13;
development in the social sectors in Paraguay, along with a US$450,000 advance from the&#13;
Project Preparation Facility (PPF). Key activities include: (a) recruitment of the core PCU&#13;
staff and training in Bank administrative and procurement procedures; (b) seminars and&#13;
workshops to disseminate international experience, particularly in the areas of education&#13;
decentralization, student assessment systems and educational statistics; (c) regional study&#13;
trips; (d) technical assistance in the design of key project components; (e) surveys and&#13;
assessments of education aspects (e.g., physical infrastructure needs, status of secondary-&#13;
level teachers, supply of library and teaching materials); and (f) technical assistance and&#13;
training to validate the proposed curriculum revisions for grades 7 -9.&#13;
B. Project Management&#13;
4 3   Organization and Management. The MEC would be responsible for overall&#13;
project planning and execution. A PCU, reporting directly to the Minister, would&#13;
coordinate all project activities and ensure that the project's execution is carried out in&#13;
accordance with established guidelines, procedures and agreed targets. A description of&#13;
the PCU structure and main functions is contained in Annex 11. An Administrative&#13;
Manual sets forth the functions and structure of the PCU, proposed staffing,&#13;
administrative and financial procedures, procurement arrangements and procurement plan,&#13;
and reporting and auditing requirements. A draft version of the Administrative Manual&#13;
was reviewed during appraisal and a revised version was presented prior to negotiations.&#13;
During negotiations, the Government confirmed its assurance that the PCU will be staffed&#13;
with high-caliber personnel satisfactory to the Bank, and that no changes to the Manual&#13;
would be made without prior Bank consultation.&#13;
4.4   Implementation Strategy. During preparation, a Project Implementation Plan&#13;
(PIP) was prepared by the Government, with inter-departmental MEC working groups&#13;
established for each component and sub-component, under the coordination of the PCU.&#13;
The PIP has been encoded in an Operational Manual which specifies objectives, activities,&#13;
targets and institutional arrangements for each area of intervention of the proposed&#13;
project. A draft of the Operational Manual was reviewed during appraisal and a revised&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
version was presented prior to negotiations. MEC's approval of both the Administrative&#13;
Manual and the Operational Manual are conditions of effectiveness.&#13;
4.5   To allow for adjustments in project implementation, the PCU would be responsible&#13;
for furnishing to the Bank an Annual Implementation Plan (Plan Operativo Anuai), no&#13;
later than March I of each year (prior to the commencement of the academic year) in a&#13;
content agreed upon at negotiations, and to include. (a) description of activities and&#13;
implementation targets on a quarterly basis for each component and sub-component of the&#13;
project, (b) identification of critical dates for specific activities, (c) areas of cooperation&#13;
with other programs related to the proposed project, (d) revised disbursement estimate&#13;
and quarterly budget by source and use of funds, and (e) the annual procurement schedule.&#13;
The presentation of the first year plan is a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
4.6   An Administrative and Procurement Review would be held in Washington during&#13;
the second year of project execution among PCU, Government and Bank staff to review&#13;
the legal, procurement and administrative aspects of project implementation. This review&#13;
process would assess the experience with procurement arrangements, discuss the findings&#13;
of the first independent financial and physical audit(s), and analyze the project's&#13;
disbursement profile and arrangements, including counterpart funds. The scope and&#13;
timing of this review was agreed upon at negotiations.&#13;
C. Project Monitoring, Evaluation and Supervision&#13;
4.7   Monitoring and Evaluation. Overall monitoring and evaluation of the proposed&#13;
project would be the responsibility of the PCU. Specific requirements include:&#13;
(a) preparation of annual reports to include: (i) a summary of the completion of&#13;
implementation targets and description of the principal activities carried out; (ii)&#13;
explanation of those planned activities and targets not achieved; (iii) identification of&#13;
critical areas of project implementation, (iv) coordination with other agencies and&#13;
programs with relation to the proposed project; (v) performance of monitoring and impact&#13;
indicators; (vi) a financial report, including a summary of expenditures, analysis of the&#13;
financial management of the project and availability of counterpart funds; (vii) a&#13;
procurement report, including completion of the procurement plan and identification of&#13;
any issues regarding procurement arrangements; (viii) analysis of PCU performance; and&#13;
(ix) recommendations for future actions, to be furnished to the Bank no later than&#13;
February 15 for the prior year, as agreed at negotiations; (b) submission of Annual&#13;
Implementation Plans (para. 4.5); (c) the timely contracting of the project impact&#13;
evaluation studies; and (d) preparation of a Project Completion Report that would be&#13;
submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the closing date of the Loan.&#13;
4.8   Based on the Operational Manual, Annex 12 presents a summary of the project's&#13;
implementation schedule as well as key sector and project performance indicators. The&#13;
sector indicators would measure efficiency, quality and coverage in order to track overall&#13;
improvements in secondary education. Other indicators would assess the project impacts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
on the institutional capacity of the MEC and the quality of teaching and school&#13;
management practices at both the school and classroom levels, where appropriate.&#13;
4.9   Mid-Term Review. A joint Bank-Government Mid-Term Review would be&#13;
carried out no later than 34 months after the date of project effectiveness, on the basis of&#13;
an independent assessment to be carried out with Bank approval of the terms of reference,&#13;
as agreed upon at negotiations.&#13;
4.10  Bank Supervision. Bank supervision requirements and schedule are presented in&#13;
Annex 13. The Bank would carry out at least two supervision missions per year as well as&#13;
the Mid-Term Review (para. 4.9). In addition, a Project Launch Workshop would be held&#13;
close to the date of project effectiveness to ensure all operational procedures are in place,&#13;
present the final outlines of the proposed project to key stakeholders in education and the&#13;
general public, and confirm the arrangements and activities presented in the first year&#13;
Annual Implementation Plan (para. 4.5).&#13;
5. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Expected Benefits&#13;
5.1   The main benefits to be realized during implementation of the proposed project&#13;
are: (a) improvement in the quality of the learning process through provision of better&#13;
learning tools, teaching practices, and physical facilities; (b) partial satisfaction of the&#13;
social demands for access to lower secondary schools, particularly from low-income urban&#13;
and rural areas; and (c) increased understanding of sector and student performance, and&#13;
the resulting enhanced capacity of the MEC to monitor and design sector policies. In the&#13;
longer-term, this should contribute to a more productive and trainable workforce, increase&#13;
the internal efficiency of the system, create a more dynamic and better-managed school&#13;
setting, and establish the analytical foundations of evolving sector policies and strategies.&#13;
5.2   Poverty Impacts. Access to and improved quality of secondary education offers&#13;
to increase the earnings potential and "trainability" of secondary school students and&#13;
thereby improve individuals' chances of rising out of poverty. Although not included in&#13;
the Program of Targeted Interventions due to the general profile of the secondary school&#13;
population, eligibility criteria for the infrastructure component target schools with a low-&#13;
income student population (para. 2.29).&#13;
B. Expected Risks and Safeguards&#13;
5.3   Risks of administrative difficulties which hamper efficient procurement and&#13;
disbursement and slow project execution, a common problem in Paraguay, would be&#13;
minimized through the application of a PCU Administrative Manual to clearly define&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
administrative and procurement procedures, upfront agreement on procurement&#13;
procedures and documents prior to implementation, and an Administrative and&#13;
Procurement Review to address issues arising during implementation. Risks of&#13;
inconsistency between the primary and secondary levels would be addressed through the&#13;
incorporation of the lower years of secondary education into the basic education cycle and&#13;
the implementation of the revised curriculum in a phased-in manner. On the operational&#13;
level, the proposed project would be coordinated closely with the IDB-financed&#13;
investment at the primary level. The risk of overload of the implementation capacity of&#13;
the MEC would be mitigated through the preparation of an Operational Manual specifying&#13;
implementation responsibilities and timelines, technical assistance and training to increase&#13;
MEC capacity and the incorporation of flexibility into project execution through the&#13;
preparation of Annual Implementation Plans. In addition, key activities will be sub-&#13;
contracted outside of the MEC or phased in as pilot activities. The risks related to&#13;
counterpartfinancing have been addressed through agreement on counterpart amounts&#13;
and disbursement mechanisms, as well as incentives for community participation in&#13;
education investments. The Bank's Asuncion Office in Asuncion, along with the annual&#13;
Country Implementation Reviews, will monitor this issue.&#13;
5.4   Environmental Risks. The project is expected to have no significant&#13;
enviromnental impacts. An environmental rating of "C" is assigned.&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;

(para. 4.6); and (ii) the Mid-Term Review (para. 4.9).&#13;
6.4   The conditions of loan effectiveness would be:&#13;
(a)   establishment of the Research Committee by ministerial resolution,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 2.13);&#13;
(b)   presentation of the budget proposal for the MEC for 1996 submitted to&#13;
Congress, including the counterpart funds necessary to carry out the&#13;
project during its first year (para. 3.6);&#13;
(c)   the presentation of the first Annual Implementation Plan, satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank (para. 4.5); and&#13;
(d)   presentation of the Administrative Manual and Operational Manual duly&#13;
approved by the MEC (para 4.4).&#13;
6.5   As a condition of disbursement for the School-Based Innovation Grants&#13;
program, the operating procedures and selection criteria would be presented to and agreed&#13;
with the Bank (para. 2.36). A condition of disbursement against textbook purchases&#13;
and distribution would be that the MEC prepare, validate and furnish to the Bank a new&#13;
curriculum and lesson plans (guidelines) for grades 7 - 9 (para. 2.14).&#13;
B. Recommendation&#13;
6.6   Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project would&#13;
constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$24.5 million to the Republic of Paraguay.&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
PARAGUAY&#13;
Secondary Education Improvement Project&#13;
Student Assessment System&#13;
1.    The Ministry of Education in the process of establishing a National System for&#13;
Evaluation of the Educational Process (SNEPE - Sistema Nacional de Evaluaci6n del&#13;
Proceso Educativo) that would support educational policy decisions. The assessment of&#13;
student learning is one of the main components of this national system. The IDB would&#13;
finance the evaluation program for primary education and the proposed project would&#13;
finance student assessments for secondary education.&#13;
2.    The following section briefly describes the objectives of the secondary education&#13;
student assessment program and highlights key elements of the program's: (i) institutional&#13;
framework for implementing the system, (ii) technical design of the assessment&#13;
instruments, (iii) test administration and analysis scheme, and (iv) promotion and&#13;
dissemination strategies.&#13;
Student Assessment Objectives&#13;
3.    The main objective of the secondary education student assessment program is to&#13;
inform educational policy decision-makers by providing periodic, valid, reliable, and timely&#13;
information on student coenitive achievement and identifying factors that can help explain&#13;
the differences in achievement.&#13;
Institutional Issues&#13;
4.    Institutional arrangements. A special unit in the Directorate of Vocational and&#13;
Educational Orientation (DOEV - Direccion de Orientaci6n Vocacional) would carry out&#13;
activities related to the general management and promotion of the system, test&#13;
development and administration, and the dissemination and use of results. The unit would&#13;
be composed of a director, a technical-pedagogical team, and an administrative team. All&#13;
aspects related to data processing and analysis would be sub-contracted.&#13;
5.    Strengthening local capacity. The DOEV's capacity to carry out its new functions&#13;
is weak and therefore, strong capacity building efforts are required. During the project&#13;
preparation phase, such efforts were initiated. For example, a workshop on selecting&#13;
objectives and item construction was provided for the DOEV's staff and evaluators from&#13;
other MEC Departments. The proposed project would continue such efforts by:&#13;
(i) providing workshops on statistics, test construction and analysis, promotion and&#13;
dissemination strategies, computer skills, and administration; (ii) financing study tours to&#13;
foreign institutions with experience in assessment, and (iii) providing means for the DOEV&#13;
staff to communicate with peers through journals, library development, and travel to&#13;
professional meetings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
Test Technical Design&#13;
6.    Cycles and grades. Assessments would be developed for students at the final&#13;
grade of the educational cycles covered by the project, which would be the equivalent of&#13;
ninth and twelfth grade. In 1997 and 1998, the present third and last year of secondary&#13;
school would be tested (i.e., 3 and 6 curso). In 1999, after the extension of prinary&#13;
education to a nine-year basic education cycle, the last year of this new cycle ( 9 grado)&#13;
and the last year of secondary education (12 grado) would be assessed.&#13;
7.    Subjects. The system would measure learning in the following subjects: Spanish,&#13;
Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Social Studies and Guarani. Spanish and Mathematics&#13;
would be the core subjects included in every national administration. Natural Sciences&#13;
would be assessed in administrations for ninth grade and Social Studies in those for&#13;
twelfth grade. Guarani would be assessed only after the curriculum changes of the&#13;
Educational Reform are carried out; that is, only after Guarani is incorporated into the&#13;
ninth and twelfth grade curriculum.&#13;
8.    Reference. The assessments would be criterion-referenced, measuring knowledge&#13;
and other key curriculum objectives of each cycle.&#13;
9.    Number and ype of items. The tests that would be nationally administered in ninth&#13;
grade would have 45 items per subject and those for twelfth graders would include 50&#13;
items per subject. These items would be multiple-choice. The tests for language at both&#13;
levels would include an essay question.&#13;
10.   Versions and Equating. For each subject, two parallel versions would be&#13;
administered during the national administrations. In order to ensure that assessment&#13;
results can be compared, the parallel versions would be equated.&#13;
11.   Standardization. The content, administration, and scoring of the tests would be&#13;
standardized.&#13;
12.   Supplementary information. Along with each test administration, surveys for&#13;
directors, teachers and parents wouldsbe carried out. These surveys would provide&#13;
information on school-related variables (e.g., textbook availability, teacher characteristics,&#13;
etc.) that enable the assessment data to be used for policy analysis.&#13;
Test Administration and Analysis&#13;
13.   Census and sample administration. The system would by sample-based, with the&#13;
exception of census-based administration for ninth grade in 1999 and for twelfth grade in&#13;
2002. These census-based administrations would be carried out in order to monitor a&#13;
complete cohort and evaluate the efforts of the educational reform.&#13;
&#13;

-                                Annex 4&#13;
14.   Years of pilot and national administration. Both pilot and national&#13;
administrations would be carried out in October. Since the surveys would not vary from&#13;
year to year, they would only be piloted at two points in the life of the project: a first&#13;
piloting in 1996 and a second one in 2001 for updating purposes. The test administration&#13;
plan for the period 1996-2002 is presented in Table I of this Annex.&#13;
15.   Reliability and validity analysis. Reliability and validity analysis would be carried&#13;
out for all tests.&#13;
16.   Analysis and further research. Thorough psychometric analysis of tests and&#13;
statistical analysis of results would be carried out. In order to attempt to explain the&#13;
differences in achievement, the analysis of the results would include analyses of the&#13;
relationships between the assessment data and the information collected in the surveys.&#13;
The level of analysis would correspond to the type of adrninistration (census or sample-&#13;
based). Optical scanning equipment would be used to speed data processing and thus,&#13;
help ensure timely information. Furthermore, an up-to-date database would also be made&#13;
available to educational researchers interested in carrying out further analyses of the&#13;
results.&#13;
Promotion and Dissemination&#13;
17.   Promoting system andfostering evaluation culture. An information, education&#13;
and communication (IEC) campaign would be carried out to inform supervisors, technical&#13;
teams, directors, teachers and the public in general on the meaning and importance of&#13;
national student assessment. It is expected that the EEC efforts would help gain support&#13;
for the system and foster a culture of evaluation.&#13;
18.   Targeted dissemination audience. The results will be disseminated to central,&#13;
regional and local authorities, teachers, supervisors and the public in general.&#13;
19.   Methods and timing of dissemination. Different reports and methods of&#13;
dissemination will be used for the different audiences and directors, teachers and&#13;
supervisors will be trained in the interpretation and use of assessment results. The formal&#13;
dissemination of results will be carried approximately four to five months after the national&#13;
admiinistrations (approximately in March of each year).&#13;
20.   Monitoring the impact of the system. These dissemination measures are intended&#13;
to influence actions at several levels of the educational system. The general performance&#13;
information will provide an important quality check on the overall system and provide a&#13;
benchmark against which educational managers and the cormmunity in general can judge&#13;
progress. In terms of specific areas of weakness revealed in the test results, the content&#13;
and orientation of the pre-service and in-service teacher training system should reflect&#13;
efforts to address these deficiencies. Once the census-based results are available for each&#13;
school, efforts to improve quality in the neediest schools can be more accurately targeted.&#13;
Proposals for school-based innovations at the local level should reflect each school's&#13;
particular performance challenges.&#13;

PARAGUAY&#13;
Secondary Education Improvement Project&#13;
Textbooks, Educational Materials, and Curricular Support&#13;
Definition and Objective&#13;
1.    This component would support the design, development, procurement,&#13;
distribution, and use of high quality educational materials for public school students in the&#13;
first, second and third years of the third cycle (seventh through ninth grades), as well as&#13;
institutional strengthening of the Department of Curriculum of the MEC.&#13;
2.    The component consists of five sub-components:&#13;
i Textbooks in Spanish, mathematics, and natural science for the three mentioned grade&#13;
levels, developed in accordance with the official curriculum of the Educational Reform&#13;
currently in preparation. A total of 866,835 texts will be purchased, distributed, and&#13;
used during the project; 288,945 each in Spanish, mathematics, and natural science&#13;
texts for the third cycle public school students (grades 7-9).&#13;
&#149; Educational materials consistent with the official curriculum and the new plans and&#13;
programs of the Educational Reform. This includes 800 sets of learning materials for&#13;
third cycle public schools in 750 official institutions and 50 subsidized institutions.&#13;
* Classroom libraries which stimulate reading habits, research, discovery, and thinking,&#13;
keys to facilitating the teaching-learning process. These will be divided as follows: (a)&#13;
basic libraries with 80 books, including dictionaries, texts, support and specialized&#13;
books for schools which do not have libraries at present. The project will acquire and&#13;
distribute 600 basic school libraries for 565 official schools and 35 subsidized&#13;
institutions; and (b) collections of 50 books to upgrade existing libraries. The project&#13;
will acquire and distribute 200 upgrade libraries for 185 official schools and 15&#13;
subsidized institutions.&#13;
* Reference books and materials for Departmental Pedagogical Units: (a) libraries&#13;
of 70 pedagogical and reference texts for Spanish, mathematics and natural sciences,&#13;
and (b) support materials to facilitate teacher training. The project will purchase and&#13;
distribute 18 sets of materials, one to each DPU.&#13;
* Training for members of the Curriculum Department, specifically the Learning&#13;
Resources Division, and other institutions in: (a) new cognitive trends in curriculum,&#13;
particularly in Spanish, mathematics and natural sciences; (b) techniques for design&#13;
and development of written materials, (c) development of selection criteria for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -                              Annex 5&#13;
textbooks and educational materials, (d) methodologies, sources and forms of research&#13;
in learning resources, and (e) mechanisms for parents' associations to increase the&#13;
sustainability of textbooks and educational materials. Support would also include&#13;
provision of basic reference materials and equipment to the Division of Learning&#13;
Resources within the Curriculum Department.&#13;
School Texts&#13;
3.    The texts currently used are based on the educational concepts of the 1973 period,&#13;
which was concerned only with the curriculum and not with the complete educational&#13;
system. They are teacher-centered texts, which produce an authoritarian and vertical&#13;
presentation of contents to students who passively receive text information. This text&#13;
concept no longer serves the needs of students and teachers, nor corresponds to the&#13;
characteristics of the Education Reform Program.&#13;
4.    Therefore, the new texts will be student-centered, will facilitate individualization,&#13;
maturation, contextualization and projection processes and will be dynamic, interactive&#13;
models capable of stimulating critical and creative thinking and the construction and&#13;
production of intelligence. Texts will be purchased in Spanish, mathematics and natural&#13;
sciences for grades 7-9 for use in the school year beginning in 1998, according to the&#13;
timetable for implementation of the revised curriculum in grades 1-9 (1994: grade 1, 1995:&#13;
grade 2, 1996: grades 3 and 4, 1997: grades 5 and 6, 1998: grades 7-9).&#13;
Educational Materials&#13;
5.    Students not only learn from the textbooks and the words of their teachers, but&#13;
from all the elements available in the classroom environment. The project will develop&#13;
specifications for optimal learning materials within the availability of resources and&#13;
congruent with the plans and programs of the new curriculum. The purchase of simple&#13;
materials for teaching natural science is anticipated, as well as materials for mathematics&#13;
and other elements which will facilitate student learning in the third cycle'. A set of&#13;
materials will be organized for each official public and subsidized educational institution in&#13;
this cycle.&#13;
School Libraries&#13;
6.     Students require diverse sources of information to facilitate their extended&#13;
learning. They should have access to a wide variety of books in order to:&#13;
(a)    contribute to the development of habits of reading according to their&#13;
interest so they may expand their symbolic horizons;&#13;
A tentative list of materials includes: maps, globes, posters and laminated charts, anatomical&#13;
displays, magnifying glasses, thermometers, scientific calculators, metric measures, geometric games,&#13;
and kits for scientific experiments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
(b)   enrich their communication and the development of their basic linguistic&#13;
functions: listening, speaking, reading and writing,&#13;
(c)   stimulate their interest in personal study and research to amplify the&#13;
knowledge and skills they receive in the classroom; and&#13;
(d)   encourage recognition of values and social norms and the preservation of&#13;
their environment.&#13;
7.    Unfortunately, current school libraries are scarce and poorly equipped. Twenty-&#13;
two percent of secondary schools have no supplemental books. More than 25 percent&#13;
have less than one hundred books, while 26 percent have between 100 and 299 books.&#13;
Only 27 percent of the schools have more than 300 books. A scant 24 percent of schools&#13;
have physical library facilities of any type.&#13;
Support Libraries for the Departmental Pedagogical Units&#13;
8.    The achievement of this project's objectives requires careful coordination among&#13;
components. A critical point is the relation between the provision of materials and training&#13;
teaching staff in their use. Therefore, this component will provide support libraries and&#13;
materials to the 18 Departmental Pedagogical Units. This support will include 40 of the&#13;
best texts concerning pedagogy, educational psychology, curriculum, evaluation, and&#13;
related subjects, 30 reference texts for the three major subject matters (natural sciences,&#13;
mathematics and Spanish), models of materials brought from other countries, technical&#13;
devices such as video recorders with a set of videos about subjects in pedagogy and in the&#13;
three main subject matters, overhead projectors and other elements to be determined&#13;
through research and user surveys.&#13;
Action Plan&#13;
9.    To select, purchase, and distribute the new texts, educational materials and school&#13;
libraries, it will be necessary to prepare an action plan which coordinates all activities. The&#13;
following suggests the major steps in the plan.&#13;
Preparation of plans and programs for Spanish, mathematics and natural&#13;
sciences for first through third grades of the third cycle.&#13;
10.   The draft version of these plans would be available no later than August 31, 1995.&#13;
Technical assistance will be provided for the validation of the third cycle plans and&#13;
programs, and training will be given in new cognitive trends in curriculum development,&#13;
particularly those areas consistent with the goals of the Educational Reform. Technical&#13;
validation of the curriculum is expected to be completed by the end of 1995.&#13;
Strengthening of the Learning Resource Division of the Curriculum Department&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
11.   The strengthening of the Learning Resource Division should be completed in the&#13;
second half of 1996, with the principal functions of establishing norms for textbook&#13;
quality, investigation and research in innovations in learning resources and the&#13;
coordination and assistance to the in-service teacher training system in the application of&#13;
these materials to the revised curriculum objectives.&#13;
12.   Once the required technical personnel have been assigned to the Learning&#13;
Resources Division, they will receive general training in design and development of&#13;
written materials, use of modern cognitive concepts and their application to the subjects of&#13;
Spanish, mathematics, and natural sciences, criteria for the selection of written materials,&#13;
methodologies and areas of research in learning resources, and in the development of mini-&#13;
laboratories for teaching science. This training will be given as part of the organization of&#13;
the Learning Resources Division during 1996-98, and will include national and&#13;
international technical assistance, study tours and seminars.&#13;
Establish the technical and pedagogic criteria for the selection of texts, learning&#13;
materials and school libraries.&#13;
13.   Critical to the component will be the development of appropriate criteria for the&#13;
selection of texts, learning materials and school libraries consistent with Paraguay's&#13;
educational needs. The principal areas for development of criteria include: consistency of&#13;
the texts with established curriculum, pedagogical quality, technical-graphic quality, and&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness criteria. The identification of these criteria will use as a base&#13;
the experience with selection criteria in the textbooks procured for grades 1 -6 under the&#13;
primary education project. It will also be necessary to determine the categories and titles&#13;
for the basic school libraries and the content of the educational materials to be provided,&#13;
which would reflect the needs of the new curricular plans and programs once these are&#13;
validated.&#13;
Purchase and distribution of textbooks, educational materials and school libraries&#13;
14.   Texts, learning materials and libraries will be acquired according to established&#13;
World Bank guidelines for procurement (January 1995). Standard Bidding Documents for&#13;
procurement of textbooks (current edition at time of application) would be used in the&#13;
international competitive bidding process. The preparation of the bidding documents will&#13;
be done according to the mentioned procedure. There will be four basic bidding processes&#13;
during the project, for (a) texts in the three subject matters for the three grades of the third&#13;
cycle, (b) educational materials for secondary schools, (c) school libraries for secondary&#13;
schools, and (d) support libraries for the Departmental Pedagogical Units.&#13;
15.   Texts: There are sufficient math, science and Spanish textbooks in the local and&#13;
regional market, particularly at the secondary level, that would serve the purposes of the&#13;
revised curriculum for grades 7 - 9, with very slight adaptation. Therefore, a one-step&#13;
ICB process is envisioned whereby the MEC would solicit texts in the three main subject&#13;
areas from the private editorial and publishing sector. The project would support training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
for the technical staff of the Department of Curriculum in the design and content of&#13;
textbooks in order to improve the ability of the MEC to select high-quality texts, not to&#13;
enable MEC to produce these texts themselves.&#13;
16.   Technical evaluation of bids proposals would be carried out by committees&#13;
comprised of Curriculum Department specialists, representatives from other MEC&#13;
departments, and teachers with classroom functions in the appropriate grades from both&#13;
rural and urban areas. These committees, one for each subject area, would use selection&#13;
criteria and checklists developed during project preparation and would ensure conformity&#13;
between the textbooks, the revised curriculum and the precepts of the Education Reform .&#13;
17.   Textbooks would be delivered pre-packaged to existing MEC storage facilities.&#13;
Under the IDB primary education project, distribution of textbooks to primary schools, a&#13;
much larger and more geographically dispersed universe, is being carried out through&#13;
MEC channels, with support from the Armed Services for distribution in rural areas. A&#13;
successful public information campaign has heightened community expectations, and&#13;
hence local supervision of the effective delivery of these texts. Textbook deliveries&#13;
scheduled for 1995-1997 will deepen this experience and provide for alternatives, if&#13;
deemed necessary. Since there are fewer schools and a greater urban concentration at the&#13;
secondary level, there may be lower-cost options, such as use of the postal service and/or&#13;
private distributors. The proposed project, would finance public or private distribution&#13;
services, based on an evaluation of the distribution systems currently in use and proposed.&#13;
Mechanisms for local level participation in the monitoring of textbook deliveries would&#13;
ensure transparency and accountability in the process and inform students and parents of&#13;
the rights and responsibilities of textbook use.&#13;
18.   Educational materials and school libraries would be procured using ICB due to the&#13;
size of the purchases foreseen and the potential for significant cost savings by accessing&#13;
regional markets for such commonly available materials (e.g. dictionaries and maps).&#13;
Bidding would specify lots of similar materials (for instance, for school libraries: reference&#13;
titles, Paraguayan literature, international literature) to increase the overall quality of the&#13;
final purchases. Since these would be largely off-the-shelf purchases, delivery times would&#13;
be shorter. School libraries and basic educational materials (excluding science kits) would&#13;
be delivered by the end of 1996 for use in the academic year starting March 1997. Science&#13;
kits would be provided during the second semester of 1998 to allow for the absorptive&#13;
capacity of the MEC in the bidding, delivery and training of the textbooks and educational&#13;
materials.&#13;
19.   Crilical Dales: Due to the importance of timely delivery of textbooks, the&#13;
following schedule has been established to permit sufficient time for delivery and initial&#13;
training for teachers in their use in the classroom and the relation to the new curriculum:&#13;
For textbooks --&#13;
=&gt; March 1996 - Distribution of revised plans and programs of the third cycle curriculum&#13;
to private sector publishing houses to stimulate the market&#13;

Sustainability of textbook provision&#13;
20.   At the school-level, textbooks would be made available for each student's use and&#13;
distributed free of charge, in keeping with the Education Reform objectives for the basic&#13;
education cycle. However, to promote respect for value of textbooks, parents of students&#13;
who lose or ruin their books would be responsible for the full cost of replacement. To&#13;
address the issue of longer-term sustainability of textbook financing after completion of&#13;
the project, the project would support the design of a mechanism to finance the acquisition&#13;
and distribution of textbooks once the project ends, including potential contributions from&#13;
parents' associations, the National Treasury and, eventually, support from regional and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-70-                              Annex S&#13;
municipal governments and NGOs. The project would support the definition of the legal,&#13;
administrative, financial and targeting aspects of this mechanism, which for the third cycle&#13;
of basic education is estimated to need on average US$600,000 per year. Parents&#13;
currently spend about US$2 per student per year on photocopies, or US$425,000 for all&#13;
public secondary school students, which would no longer be necessary with sufficient&#13;
supply of texts and educational materials.&#13;
Evaluation of the achievements of the component&#13;
21.   Evaluation of the results of this component would cover three areas: (a) on-going&#13;
monitoring of quantitative targets, i.e., that the number and quality of textbooks and&#13;
materials are delivered in an appropriate and timely fashion; (b) evaluations and surveys of&#13;
actual use of textbooks and educational materials; and (c) evaluations of sustainability&#13;
features of the component. To the extent possible, impacts on student achievement would&#13;
be carried out in concordance with the implementation of the student assessment system.&#13;
Technical Assistance Requirements&#13;
22.   To insure that MEC staff increase their knowledge, skills, and implementation&#13;
capacity, several international consultants would be contracted to offer services through&#13;
workshops and seminars as well as direct support in the execution of specific tasks. These&#13;
services will emphasize human resource development in the Learning Resource Division&#13;
and other departments of the Ministry. Nine consultants are planned in relevant subject&#13;
areas for a total of 540 person/days of assistance.&#13;

Annex 6&#13;
PARAGUAY&#13;
Secondary Education Improvement Project&#13;
Strategy for Training of Teachers And School Managers&#13;
General Objectives and Strategy&#13;
1.    This component has two main areas of emphasis: training for effective school&#13;
management; and school-based teacher training to improve teaching practices in the&#13;
classroom. The component would be implemented in a decentralized framework.&#13;
Strategies such as tutorials, discussion groups, and classroom demonstrations will be&#13;
used to link the training with the real difficulties faced by those who work in secondary&#13;
schools. The training activities will be supported by self-instructional materials,&#13;
guidebooks, complementaryqibliography and audio-visual resources.&#13;
Institutional Framework&#13;
2.    The implementation of the above strategy will require: (a) the strengthening of&#13;
the MEC to play a more strategic role in providing training; (b) a decentralized network&#13;
of training providers; and (c) targeting criteria for some training activities to the schools&#13;
which display priority needs for quality enhancements.&#13;
3.    The decentralized training network The institutional framework to&#13;
implement the component divides functions between the national, regional and school&#13;
level. This division is consistent with the National System for Teacher Training&#13;
(SINAD), currently under implementation with the IDB-financed primary education&#13;
project. As such the Department of Teacher Training ( Departarnento de Formaci6n&#13;
Docente - DFD) and the Institute of Higher Education (ISE), will be responsible for the&#13;
overall planning and supervising of implementation. A Technical Unit for Teacher&#13;
Training (UTAD- Unidad Tecnica de Actualizaci6n Docente) would be established&#13;
within the DFD, directly responsible for the implementation of the component. This&#13;
central team would be staffed with specialists in human resource development,&#13;
curriculumn, teaching methods in the core subjects and training materials. The UrAD&#13;
would be responsible for: (a) designing and planning the guidelines for training content&#13;
and methodology; (b) production (through out-sourcing) of training materials for&#13;
teacher's update workshops; (e) training delivery and monitoring; and (f) dissemination&#13;
of results. To avoid overstaffing of the DFD and to ensure a high-quality and timely&#13;
implementation, many of these functions will be performed with the support of short-&#13;
term technical assistance. Production of training materials, development of a monitoring&#13;
system, external evaluation and dissemination would be contracted with external&#13;
institutions or independent specialists. Training for school management would be&#13;
addressed to school principals, supervisors and other technical staff such as evaluation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -                                    Annex 6&#13;
and pedagogical coordinators. Training for teachers would be divided into two&#13;
activities: (i) training for effective use of educational materials; and (ii) continuous&#13;
updating of training subjects.&#13;
4.     The UTAD would work closely With the 18 Departmental Pedagogic Units&#13;
(Unidad Departamental Pedag6gica, UPD) staffed with a small team of professionals.&#13;
The UPD would coordinate training activities at departmental levels which would be&#13;
developed by educators and supervisors. This network of units supervised by ETN at&#13;
the central level, would be responsible for training of school principals and providing&#13;
technical assistance for school-based training in their respective departments. The&#13;
project will finance a set of bibliographic materials, training materials, VCRs and Video&#13;
Tapes, photocopy machines and other training resources, that will be used to support&#13;
training activities and development of teaching materials within the region.&#13;
5.     The UPD would alsoc (a) provide technical assistance regarding the content,&#13;
strategies and use of the training materials; (b) identify additional training resources in&#13;
the region, especially teachers and general educators to help with school-based training;&#13;
(c) disseminate the training experiences and promote interchange among the schools;&#13;
(d) provide the school committees and parents with timely and reliable information&#13;
about the training proeram; and (e) monitor the training activities in accordance with&#13;
the guidelines provided by the central executive team.&#13;
6.    The school and/or groups of schools would be responsible for: (a) the&#13;
organization, delivery and school-level evaluation of teacher training; (b) identification&#13;
of individual school training needs; (c) taking steps to meet their specific training needs,&#13;
using the resources available at the school or community level, in order to increase&#13;
school autonomy.&#13;
7.     Targeting schools. Training of school principals and teacher training for more&#13;
effective use of teaching materials will include all secondary schools. Continuous&#13;
training in the basic curriculum subjects will be initially targeted to the "high-risk&#13;
schools", located in low income areas and with high repetition and dropouts rates. The&#13;
estimated number of schools is about 180, or 15% to 20% of the schools in each&#13;
region. During the life of the project the number of participating schools would increase&#13;
in Line with implementation and supervision capacity.&#13;

Impact Estimates. The impact (*) is defined as the effect of project activities on system&#13;
requirements to the year 2000. In the case of coverage, the project would satisfy 90 percent of&#13;
the anticipated demand for new student places in the third cycle of basic education based on&#13;
projected improvements in the effective promotion rates of the system. An increase in the&#13;
effective promotion rate of the first five years of primary school from 80 at present to 84 percent,&#13;
an increase from 63 to 74 percent for sixth grade, and from 74 to 80 percent for grades 7-9 would&#13;
result in a total enrollment of graders 7-9 of 183,950 by the year 2000 (see attached tables for&#13;
enrollment projections), resulting in an increase in the enrollment rate of grades 7-9 to 56 percent.&#13;
Requirements to theyear 2000. Needs for minor and major rehabilitation and&#13;
substitution (rebuilding of existing schools whose physical condition is beyond rehabilitation) are&#13;
based on a census of secondary school infrastructure carried out during project preparation, in&#13;
which 58 percent of classrooms were found to be in acceptable condition (requiring only minor&#13;
rehabilitation over the next five years), 38 percent were in normal condition (requiring major&#13;
rehabilitation over the next five years) and four percent require complete substitution.&#13;
Complementary facilities include bathrooms, administrative areas and libraries.&#13;

'Based on estimated package size and timing of goods to be procured, it is expected that: (a) school&#13;
furniture would be purchased either through ICB (USS 1.8 million) or NCB (US$0.6 million)&#13;
depending on the size of the yearly lot; (b) non-printed educational materials - principally science kits&#13;
- would be procured through ICB (US$1.35 million); (c) library materials would be procured using&#13;
ICB (USS1.35 million ) with the exception of small purchases of reference material (US$0.02)&#13;
through national shopping; (d) vehicles (USS0.21 million) through LIB; (e) office equipment (US$0.1&#13;
million) and other printed materials - tests, manuals, training materials- (USS 1.2 million) through&#13;
national shopping; (f) computers and photocopiers (US$0.45 million) through LIB with the exception&#13;
of about US$0.02 million in computers to be procured under national and international shopping.&#13;
2Distribution of textbooks would be carried out in accordance with the procurement plan, and based on a&#13;
evaluation of the ongoing textbook distribution under the IDB-financed primary education project as&#13;
well as a market study of alternatives. Where private services are to be contracted, competitive&#13;
procedures would apply. Where MEC infrastructure is used, distribution would be treated as an&#13;
operating cost for procurement purposes. A mixed system may also be applied.&#13;

Performance Indicators&#13;
Perfornance and impact would be measured against the objectives of the project, namely to&#13;
expand access at the secondary level, to improve the quality and effectiveness of secondary&#13;
education, to strengthen capacity in information-based decisioumaking and policy design, and to&#13;
support more dynamic and participatory school management. The tables below identify:&#13;
(a) the indicators used to measure progress in meeting each objective;&#13;
(b) the expected impact (quantitative or qualitative);&#13;
(c) methodology to be used in gathering information;&#13;
(d) the level of observation since some impacts are expected to be observed at the level of&#13;
the educational system, others at the level of the institutional capacity of the MEC, and&#13;
others can best be discerned at the micro-level, either within the school or the classroom;&#13;
(e) the project area, either component or subcomponent, related to these expected impacts';&#13;
(f) whether (partial) results would be available for the mid-term review (MTR); and&#13;
(g) how the indicator would be evaluated under project impact studies2.&#13;

Supervision Strategy&#13;
Supervision of the proposed project would have three main areas of emphasis:&#13;
* assessing quality control to ensure project benefits are realized;&#13;
* monitoring compliance with the legal and admninistrative requirements of project&#13;
implementation;&#13;
* building an on-going sector policy dialogue with Government&#13;
Supervision tasks would include the following:&#13;
Project Launch: A Project Launch Workshop would be held on a date close to project&#13;
effectiveness to ensure all operational procedures are in place, present the final outlines of&#13;
the proposed project to key stakeholders in education and the general public, review&#13;
eligible expenditures for retroactive financing and discuss the first Annual Implementation&#13;
Plan.&#13;
Annual Strategic Planning Workshops: These workshops, held in the first quarter of&#13;
each year (CY), would be organized by the PCU, chaired by the Minister of Education (or&#13;
the Vice-Minister as designated) and attended by all relevant MEC managers and staff, the&#13;
Executive Director of the Education Reform Council and interested members, the&#13;
Coordinator of the Primary Education Project PCU, and IBRD staff. The purpose of&#13;
these annual workshops would be to: (a) present and discuss the annual progress report on&#13;
project implementation; (b) review sector performance indicators; (c) review findings of&#13;
policy studies and impact evaluations-to be financed by the proposed project; (d) update&#13;
project implementation targets, schedules and action plans; and (e) confirmn the&#13;
consistency of project activities with evolving sector strategies and institutional structures.&#13;
Supervision of compliance with the legal and administrative aspects of project&#13;
implementation would be carried out during the mission as well.&#13;
Supervision Missions: Routine supervision missions would be held in the third quarter&#13;
(CY) of year 1, 2, 4 and 5 of project execution. Specialists would be included on specific&#13;
components depending on issues raised in the Annual Strategic Planning Workshops and&#13;

            The Secondary Education Improvement
            Project will support the Government's initiatives to
            improve the quality, efficiency and coverage of secondary
            education, and to increase the Ministry of Education's
            (MEC's) institutional capacity for information-based
            decision-making. The project consists of the following five
            components: 1) institutional strengthening; 2) provision of
            textbooks, educational materials and curricular support; 3)
            training for teachers and school managers; 4) infrastructure
            upgrading and expansion; and 5) pilot proposal for
            school-based innovation projects.
