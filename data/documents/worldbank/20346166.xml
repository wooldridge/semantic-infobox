This project supported efforts to place road safety on the political agenda in&#13;
the Latin American and Caribbean region. The project supported the creation&#13;
of an innovative virtual platform, the Ibero-American Road Safety Observatory&#13;
(OISEVI), which 22 countries use to exchange experiences and develop statistics&#13;
to design effective policy solutions. In Argentina, the pilot country for reform, the&#13;
results were important improvements in road safety indicators.&#13;

The Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project improved disaster&#13;
preparedness and reduced vulnerability at the local level in Haiti. The project&#13;
established 76 Communal Civil Protection Committees (CCPC), covering more&#13;
than half of the 144 communes. In addition, the project successfully implemented&#13;
130 small-scale disaster mitigation works, based on community-based disaster risk&#13;
assessments.&#13;

&amp;#12;Through their understanding of Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s experience, Ghanaian participants enhanced their knowledge of how to develop public-private&#13;
partnerships in irrigation, how to identify and mitigate the safeguards and commercial risks, and how to shape the role of the government&#13;
around the core responsibilities necessary to implement successful partnerships.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            A focus on development results is at the
            heart of the Latin America and Caribbean Region&#146;s approach
            to delivering programs and policy advice with partners in
            middle-income and low income countries alike. Through
            knowledge, convening activities, and financial services we
            strive to help people across the region create better
            opportunities and build a better future for themselves,
            their families and their country. Documenting, measuring and
            evaluating results of what we do, helps us and our partners
            to engage more effectively, learn from our experiences and
            apply lessons to the design and implementation of future
            interventions. This collection of result stories shows our
            continuous efforts to adopt and integrate technical
            analysis, timely policy advice, and a variety of financial
            instruments into programs that are aligned with client
            priorities. Results show the increased demand and the
            effectiveness of peer-to-peer learning, have led to a
            scaling up our support for South-South exchange activities
            and the use our convening power to support successful
            partnerships and mobilize additional resources to finance
            development work.
