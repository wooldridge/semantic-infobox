    Foreword&#13;
    Indian remains one of the countries wherein a lot of efforts are still required to eliminate the practice&#13;
    of open defecation. In rural areas, open defecation though reduced in scale continues to be a&#13;
    socially and culturally accepted traditional behavior largely. Low awareness of the potential health&#13;
    and economic benefits of better sanitation and hygiene practices, perception of high costs of having&#13;
    a toilet, the perceived convenience of open defecation are some of the other bottlenecks towards&#13;
    achievement of the goal of Open Defecation Free India. Lack of priority to safe confinement and&#13;
    disposal of human excreta poses significant health risks manifest in the sanitation challenge facing&#13;
    the nation today.&#13;
&#13;
    However, the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) launched by Government of India in 1999 has gone&#13;
    a long way in achieving and sustaining the status of open defecation free Gram Panchayats in rural&#13;
    India and ensuring healthy and hygienic environment. The vigorous efforts made under this Campaign&#13;
    have helped to achieve rural sanitation coverage to an estimated 70 per cent as of March 2011. The&#13;
    campaign has proved to be one of the most effective programme for its focus on community-led,&#13;
    demand driven approach, making long term positive impact on the health profiles and quality of lives&#13;
    of millions of rural people. The campaign has developed strategic components to ensure full coverage&#13;
    of sanitation through financial and programmatic support in software and hardware component of&#13;
    household, school, anganwadi and community sanitation.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Foreword&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The provision of providing sanitation facilities through public toilet complexes is the most suitable&#13;
option for those who cannot afford individual toilets for monetary reasons or due to lack of space and&#13;
go for open defecation. Such complexes are useful and valuable option at public places, markets,&#13;
taxi stands etc. where large congregation of people takes place. The Community Sanitary Complex&#13;
(CSCs) fosters the cognitive development of healthy sanitation practices in the community. The TSC&#13;
recognizes Community Sanitary Complexes as one of the options to reduce open defecation and&#13;
has provision of a maximum unit cost of 2 lakh for construction of CSC, where the sharing pattern&#13;
amongst Central Government, State Government and the community is in the ratio of 60:30:10.&#13;
However besides financial resources, technical and management advice are also required for effective&#13;
construction and maintenance of Community Sanitary Complexes. This is important because lack of&#13;
adequate knowledge for construction, operation and maintenance, may render such facilities unusable&#13;
and non-functional.&#13;
&#13;
The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation has been continuously updating technical notes&#13;
on rural sanitation to reinforce the quality of interventions. The Handbook on Ã¢&#128;&#152;Establishment and&#13;
Management of Community Sanitary Complexes in Rural AreasÃ¢&#128;&#153; gives very useful insight on the&#13;
planning, construction, operation and maintenance of sanitary toilet complexes in a sustainable way.&#13;
The manual is intended primarily for programme implementers to help them understand the critical&#13;
need for Community Sanitary Complexes and inform them of the guiding principles to be adopted&#13;
while planning for CSCs. The scope of this document has been made comprehensive by including&#13;
several aspects like safe disposal or reuse of human waste from toilet complexes and extensive&#13;
guidance on different options for toilet designs with indicative costs. The manual encompasses both&#13;
technological and management aspects of CSCs and will be of specific interest to Gram Panchayat&#13;
representatives, village level motivators and village level sanitation committees etc. who are entrusted&#13;
with the responsibility for planning for sanitation facilities at the village level.&#13;
&#13;
This is a result of excellent term work and synergy of contributions from professionals who have&#13;
worked tirelessly in developing this technical note, ably assisted by WSP-SA. I wish to place on&#13;
record our deep appreciation of this effort and hope that this document will be immensely useful as a&#13;
Reference Manual.&#13;

2.1	 Importance of Sanitation in                    pathogens which carry disease and infection.&#13;
Rural Areas                                         Human waste contain a spectrum of pathogens,&#13;
                                                    and over 50 types of different infections are&#13;
Sanitation is a broad term which includes safe      transmitted through direct or indirect routes&#13;
disposal of human waste, waste-water and solid      from such waste. Also, in villages, people&#13;
waste, domestic and personal hygiene, food          generally defecate near the source of water,&#13;
hygiene, etc. Safe disposal of human waste is       which contaminates water bodies resulting in&#13;
the most important aspect of sanitation. In a       even greater infection through use of that water&#13;
developing country, over 80 percent diseases        for various purposes such as drinking, cooking,&#13;
are caused due to infections transmitted through    bathing, washing. The health consequences of&#13;
direct or indirect routes from human waste.         such actions are clearly visible amongst villagers&#13;
                                                    in the form of high and repeated cases of illness,&#13;
The immediate benefits of improved sanitation in    especially diarrhoeal diseases, which lead to loss&#13;
rural areas include:                                of working days affecting the earning potential&#13;
                                                    of the affected person and thus the economic&#13;

                                                    under five, are most prone to diarrhoea which&#13;
Most importantly, the medium- and long-term         can sometimes prove fatal. The effect of a child&#13;
impacts of sanitation include:                      falling ill in early life is visible later in the form of&#13;

Open defecation is still practiced in many rural    areas distant from home. Women, especially&#13;

       Some Important Points to be considered before Implementing Sanitary Toilet Complexes in&#13;
       Rural Areas&#13;
&#13;
       Ã¢&#128;Â¢	   They are expensive to build; sometimes the cost can run into lakhs of rupees depending on the number&#13;
            of toilet seats!&#13;
       Ã¢&#128;Â¢	   O&amp;M of these facilities if often a challenge and need to be planned properly upfront and thereafter&#13;
            monitored regularly. Since it is a public property, users fail to maintain it with the same care as with&#13;
            individual toilets. Therefore, at the implementation stage, active involvement of the community to&#13;
            undertake maintenance should be assured.&#13;
       Ã¢&#128;Â¢	   These facilities need to be maintained Ã¢&#128;&#147; there should be some person or institution responsible for its&#13;
            maintenance; this caretaker who will maintain the facility needs to be paid. In addition, the maintenance&#13;
            of the facility involves other costs, like water, cleaning material, etc., all of which will incur regular costs.&#13;
       Ã¢&#128;Â¢	   Also, someone should monitor the maintenance regularly.  This system has to be put in place by&#13;
            creating awareness and motivation among the local communities, to inculcate the habit of use and&#13;
            ownership of the toilet complex by the community.&#13;
       So community or public toilets should be constructed only when all other options such as individual&#13;
       or shared toilets are not possible.&#13;

       CASE STUDY: Community Involvement in Planning, Implementation and Maintenance of&#13;
       Village Sanitary Infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
       Dhamner village in Satara district of Maharashtra is an example of community involvement in total sanitation&#13;
       and waste water management. The village has 550 residential houses spread over a main village and&#13;
       three hamlets. In the year 2000, residents of Dhamner came together under a dynamic leader and decided&#13;
       to undertake measures to manage individual and community waste water with the goal of a cleaner and&#13;
       healthier village. Government functionaries acted as facilitators while villagers were encouraged to decide&#13;
       take a decision on and set up sanitation facilities at their own expense. Dhamner residents were thus&#13;
       motivated for towards overall development of the village which has resulted in total sanitation coverage of&#13;
       the village as well as an efficient and low-cost system of waste management.    &#13;
       At the Gram Sabha, villagers of Dhamner decided to take measures to hygienically and productively&#13;
       manage sullage. It was decided to construct partially-covered roadside drains and use Reinforced Cement&#13;
       Concrete (RCC) pipes where necessary. It was made mandatory for each house to connect their its&#13;
       domestic waste water to the community drain. A chamber was provided between the house and the main&#13;
       drain, and a grid placed at each opening between the main drain and a household connection to stop&#13;
       materials like such as paper and plastics from entering the drainage system. The sullage is collected at four&#13;
       low-lying points. The stabiliszed effluent has been utiliszed for to water a childrenÃ¢&#128;&#153;s park and playground,&#13;
       and developing horticultural gardens and orchards.&#13;
&#13;
       Individual connections to the drains are maintained by the families and the community drainage system by&#13;
       the Gram Panchayat. For the last four years, the Gram Panchayat has not needed to spend any money for&#13;
       on maintenance. The park and horticultural gardens are maintained by womenÃ¢&#128;&#153;s self help groupsSHGs and&#13;
       a youth club.&#13;
&#13;
       For the initial construction of the system, the total capital expenditure was Rs. 9,46,000. A part of this was&#13;
       raised from contributions and voluntary laborlabour by the local people. A major share was provided from&#13;
       the Rajya Sabha memberÃ¢&#128;&#153;s discretionary fund. The village Panchayat is expecting earnings from the sale of&#13;
       the produce of the orchards as well.&#13;
&#13;
       Dhamner is an example of what can be achieved when there is community involvement, collective efforts&#13;
       and dynamic leadership with the government acting as a facilitator. The technology used is low-cost, easily&#13;
       manageable and environment-friendly. In recognition of its achievements, Dhamner village Panchayat&#13;
       received the Nirmal Gram Puraskar, a national award for clean environment, in 2005.&#13;

&#13;
       Technical&#13;
       	         Is the required water supply available for this technology to work?&#13;
       	         Is the soil type suitable, e.g., for operation of soak ways under this&#13;
                 technology?&#13;
       	         Is there enough space/transport available for ensuring disposal/removal&#13;
                 of sludge? Does this safeguard human and environmental health?&#13;
       	         Is the technology socio-culturally acceptable to the community&#13;
&#13;
       Financial&#13;
       	         What is the capital cost? What are the sources of funding for this?&#13;
       	         What is the O&amp;M cost?&#13;
       	         Is there any revenue generating potential from this technology like&#13;
                 biogas production, composting, etc?&#13;
       		&#13;
       Operation and Maintenance&#13;

                 expertise of masons?&#13;
       	         Will this technology be comfortable to use for different sets of users like&#13;
                 women, children. and the elderly?&#13;
       	         Will this technology help in diversifying the use of the community toilet&#13;
                 with additional facilities like bathing chambers for women, etc?&#13;
       	         Will this technology offer easy maintenance on a day- to-day basis for&#13;
                 the users?&#13;
       	         Will the O&amp;M cost of this technology be viable enough? Can these&#13;
                 costs be raised from the users/other sources?&#13;
         			&#13;

       Box 3:&#13;
       Types of Cost&#13;
&#13;
       Capital costs are the expenses, which are incurred only once to make the facility operational and ready for&#13;
       use such as land, construction labour and materials, construction supervision, etc.&#13;
&#13;
       Operating costs mean the expenses incurred in running of the facility on a daily basis such as cleaning,&#13;
       cost of water and soap, etc.&#13;
&#13;
       Maintenance costs refer to the costs needed to keep the technology in proper working condition such as&#13;
       repair works, pipe and drain cleaning, etc.&#13;

After the identification of stakeholders and other&#13;

in the planning stage, the Gram Panchayat will                Key O&amp;M Arrangements&#13;
have some clarity on Ã¢&#128;&#152;whoÃ¢&#128;&#153; the people are who&#13;
can potentially take responsibility for O&amp;M.                  Community Management: Ã¢&#128;&#147; Self management&#13;

                                                              Community Contracting: Ã¢&#128;&#147; User households&#13;
people contribute to O&amp;M. What would be the                   hire a person/agency to do carry out O&amp;M for&#13;
arrangement under which they can work? Who                    them and beneficiaries pay a monthly charge&#13;
will lead the O&amp;M arrangement? How would the                  based on the family card.&#13;
                                                              NGO/SHG/CBO Involvement : Ã¢&#128;&#147; User&#13;

            Establishment and management of community
            sanitary complexes in rural areas : a handbook
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Indian remains one of the countries
            wherein a lot of efforts are still required to eliminate the
            practice of open defecation. In rural areas, open defecation
            though reduced in scale continues to be a socially and
            culturally accepted traditional behavior largely. Low
            awareness of the potential health and economic benefits of
            better sanitation and hygiene practices, perception of high
            costs of having a toilet, the perceived convenience of open
            defecation are some of the other bottlenecks towards
            achievement of the goal of open defecation free India. Lack
            of priority to safe confinement and disposal of human
            excreta poses significant health risks manifest in the
            sanitation challenge facing the nation today. However, the
            Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) launched by Government of
            India in 1999 has gone a long way in achieving and
            sustaining the status of open defecation free Gram
            Panchayats in rural India and ensuring healthy and hygienic
            environment. The vigorous efforts made under this Campaign
            have helped to achieve rural sanitation coverage to an
            estimated 70 per cent as of March 2011. The campaign has
            proved to be one of the most effective programs for its
            focus on community-led, demand driven approach, making long
            term positive impact on the health profiles and quality of
            lives of millions of rural people. The campaign has
            developed strategic components to ensure full coverage of
            sanitation through financial and programmatic support in
            software and hardware component of household, school,
            anganwadi and community sanitation. The handbook may also be
            useful for district and state functionaries involved in the
            implementation of the TSC. It may also be of interest to
            other professionals and entrepreneurs working in the field
            of rural sanitation.
