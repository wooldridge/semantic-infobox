This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission that visited Colombia from November 29 to December 15,&#13;
1993. Updating missions visited BogotA in May 1994, and following the change of government, in September, 1994, and&#13;
again in February 1995, after the new Mayor took office, in order to complete the appraisal. The missions comprised,&#13;
inter alia, Messrs/Mlmes. P. Hari Prasad (Task Manager until May 1994), R. Venkateswaran (Task Manager since May&#13;
1994), M. Libhaber, S. Contreras, 0. Alvarado, F. Feld, T. Serra, (all of LA31N and/or LA3EU), G. Yepes (TWUWS),&#13;
M. Mejia, D. Graham (LATEN). Ms. C. van den Berg (LA3EU) prepared the economic analysis of the project. Messrs. P.&#13;
Ludwig (LA3IN) and E. McCarthy (LA3EU) were the responsible Division Chiefs during the appraisal period. Messrs. G.&#13;
Yepes and V. Gouarne acted as peer reviewers. The Projects Advisor and Department Director are Messrs. R. Crown and&#13;
P. Isenman ( Mr. Yoshiaki Abe was Director until October 1, 1995).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I.    Water and Sanitation Sector Overview&#13;
1.   Colombia, with a population of about 35 million, 70% of which is urban, has made impressive&#13;
strides in expanding its water and sanitation sector in the past decade. Over 76% of the population now&#13;
has access to drinking water, while sanitary sewerage covers over 64% of households in the country. The&#13;
coverage levels in the four biggest urban centers of Bogota, Medellin, Cali and Barranquilla, which&#13;
together account for 30% of the population, is substantially higher, at 88% for water and 85% for&#13;
sewerage. Nevertheless, major institutional problems persist, having their origin in highly politicized&#13;
utility companies and a lack of accountability for performance.&#13;
A.     Economic Background&#13;
2.   The administration of President Sanper, who took office in July 1994, is continuing the basic policy&#13;
of liberalization of the economy, that was the cornerstone of the economic reform process started by the&#13;
previous administration of President Gaviria, but with a renewed focus on expanding and improving the&#13;
provision of basic infrastructure and services to the majority of the population.&#13;
3.   Consistent with this objective, the priorities are now to consolidate prudent macroeconomic&#13;
management through restraint of the fiscal deficit and inflation, further reforms in key structural areas&#13;
(trade, finance, labor legislation), privatization of major public institutions and activities (ports, railways,&#13;
banks), and a sharper focus on improving the coverage and quality of services such as health, education,&#13;
and sanitation, through a public expenditures program concentrated in the social sectors and infrastructure,&#13;
and policies to encourage the private provision of public services (e.g. through bidding out port and railway&#13;
operations and electric power generation). The Government's strategy also aims at promoting the&#13;
establishment of a more responsive system of governance based on decentralization and community&#13;
participation, through continued restructuring of state agencies and development of more adequate&#13;
regulatory structures and mechanisms.&#13;
4.   The Bank's 1993 CSP endorsed the previous Government's priorities and approach. In&#13;
recent discussions with the incoming Government the Bank has emphasized continued support in&#13;
addressing infrastructure and human resource development needs and greater emphasis upon&#13;
improved targeting mechanisms for the poor. Improving project implementation will continue to&#13;
be a major priority, and among the critical conclusions is the importance of ensuring quality at&#13;
entry through addressing major institutional and systemic issues before going ahead with lending&#13;
operations.&#13;
B.    Institutional and Legal Framework&#13;
5.   A new regulatory framework conducive to efficiency improvements, expanded private sector&#13;
participation in the delivery of public services, greater accountability, and a more arm's length relationship&#13;
between the utilities and local politicians was legislated by the Government as Public Services Law (Law&#13;
142) and approved by the outgoing legislature in July 1994 (see para 32.). Through various modemization&#13;
decrees issued in December 1992, the National Government also introduced several modifications in sector&#13;
policies, institutions, operations, and finances, aimed at promoting sector reforms. The most important&#13;
reform took place in the Ministry of Development, with the creation of the Vice-Ministry of Water,&#13;
Housing and Urban Development, which took over responsibility for the sector, previously under the&#13;
Ministry of Public Works. Two new institutions were also created in the Ministry of Development: the&#13;
Potable Water and Sanitation Directorate, "Direccion de Agua Potable y Saneamiento" (DAPS), and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Water Regulatory Commission, "Comision Reguladora de Agua y Saneamiento" (CRAS). At the same&#13;
time, the environmental functions in the Ministry of Health were transferred to the newly created Ministry&#13;
of the Environment (ME). In addition, under the Public Services Law, the Government has also established&#13;
the Superintendency of Domestic Public Services, "Superintendencia de Servicios Publicos Domiciliares"&#13;
(SSPD). The SSPD is expected to be a powerful entity with responsibilities for general administration and&#13;
control of policies, including establishing uniform accounting systems, supervising proper administration of&#13;
subsidies and enforcing regulations. In view of the importance of public disclosure of the operating&#13;
performance of public services, SSPD has an important role in disseminating information on a comparative&#13;
basis of relevant statistics and operational performance indicators. As indicated in the following paragraph,&#13;
the Bank's contuining sector dialogue will monitor SSPD'd overall development and assist it in fulfilling its&#13;
important functions.&#13;
6.   The CRAS includes the Minister of Development who also serves as chairman, the Minister of&#13;
Health, the Director of DNP and three full time experts. It oversees waste water, sewerage and sanitation&#13;
services, with tasks including the definition of efficiency criteria and quality standards, promoting&#13;
competition for management of services, curtailing monopolistic and restrictive practices, resolving&#13;
conflicts among public enterprises, setting tariffs for regulated public services, establishing general&#13;
formulas and criteria for pricing and deciding the degree of autonomy for tariff adjustments among sector&#13;
companies. The other sector institution DAPS has several functions oriented at supporting service&#13;
activities of nation-wide scope, such as preparing, in coordination with DNP, the sector development plan,&#13;
providing technical assistance to local and regional sector institutions, promoting and coordinating sector&#13;
research, preparing and coordinating a national training program and promoting national programs and&#13;
plans, especially for rural areas. The Government has expressed interest in Bank assistance in&#13;
strengthening these newly established institutions and enabling them to fulfill their respective roles.&#13;
C.     Current Sector Issues&#13;
1.      Countrywide Issues&#13;
7.         Main Sector Problems. The water sector in Colombia is comprised of just over 1,000 separate&#13;
urban water and sanitation companies ranging in size from about 900,000 to about 1,000 households served.&#13;
These companies reflect a wide variety of ownership, efficiency and operational patterns and mnany of them have&#13;
additional functions (e.g., services covering solid waste, markets, slaughterhouses, etc.). As outlined in the 1990-&#13;
1994 Social and Economic Development Plan, until the end of the last decade, this sector suffered from a wide&#13;
array of problems including: a highly centamlized system; institutional instability; low national coverage; poor&#13;
service quality; inefficiencies at various administrative and operational levels; lack of qualified personnel;&#13;
inequitable coverage and exclusion of many of the poorest households and marginal areas. After six extensive&#13;
reorganizations in the system over the past five decades, and with about US$4.5 billion invested over the past&#13;
three decades, coverage increased significantly; however, investment targets in terms of access to established and&#13;
reliable water and sewerage service was still limited not only to the wealthier groups in urban areas but also in&#13;
terms of urban-rural coverage. While detailed records on quality, reliability of service, etc., are not available;&#13;
sample data indicate that although most of the large systems provide close to 24 hours of service, many&#13;
neighborhoods served by such systemns may not have service for days or they may have frequent interruptions.&#13;
Also, there are several companies where the entire system suffers sustained significant down-time for a variety of&#13;
institutional, technical, financial and other reasons. At the national level, only about 50% of the water companies&#13;
have treatment plants and of these, only about 50% (primarily the larger ones), provide treated drinking water on&#13;
a regular and consistent basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8.   Environmental Degradation. Many of Colombia's waterways suffer major environmental damage&#13;
from pollution due to domestic sewage, industrial effluents, solid waste, pesticides, or oil pipeline leaks.&#13;
Government estimates indicate that in 1991, almost all of the industries in and around the main urban&#13;
centers in Colombia were discharging effluents in rivers and coastal waters, of which about 40% went in&#13;
the watershed of the River Magdalena (excluding the Bogota River) and 35% in the Bogota River.&#13;
Additionally, increased sedimentation is caused by watershed degradation and toxic contamination from&#13;
mining operations. Wastewater treatment facilities are almost totally absent; currently, only about 2% of the&#13;
effluent of the sewerage system nationwide receives any treatment before disposal. The continued rapid growth&#13;
of urban populations at rates much higher than the national average adds to the pollution problem of these&#13;
urban centers and highlights the urgent need for sewage treatment facilities.&#13;
9.   While Colombia's pollution-control laws are quite comprehensive, enforcement is generally weak and&#13;
penalties, even when they are imposed, are less than the cost of compliance. Institutional weaknesses, poor&#13;
inter-agency coordination and overlapping mandates have also contributed to the present situation. As a&#13;
result, and because of such additional factors as cost-benefit externalities, multiple pollution sources, non-&#13;
compliance with cost-recovery mechanisms and a short-term focus to date, it has been almost impossible&#13;
to reach consensus among the various interest groups.&#13;
10.  Solid waste collection is available to about 60% of the urban population and non-existent in rural&#13;
areas. System inadequacies contribute to several environmental and health hazards and this is also a&#13;
significant source of water pollution. Recent efforts to privatize the BogotA solid waste collection system&#13;
have resulted in substantial improvement, although deficiencies have recently become apparent in the part&#13;
of the city not so far covered by private operators (for which emergency remedial measures have been&#13;
taken).&#13;
11.  Health Impact. Diseases associated with unsafe water and inadequate sanitation are endemic in&#13;
Colombia; diarrheal diseases and enteritis are among the five most important primary causes of deaths in&#13;
all age groups up to fourteen years. Among infants in their first year, they are the second leading cause of&#13;
death and for those below five years, they are the leading cause. Although substantial progress has been&#13;
made in the past two decades in reducing mortality and morbidity in the country, the provision of safe&#13;
water and adequate sanitation is required to complement other efforts by the Govenmment in the public&#13;
health field in order to reduce such incidence from water and sanitation related diseases to intemationally&#13;
acceptable levels.&#13;
12.  Government's Role in the Sector. During the early 1900s, the task of providing water to various&#13;
communities was one assumed by individuals, private water companies or municipalities, with some Central&#13;
Government assistance. As urbanization made this task more complex and unfulfilled needs grew, the Central&#13;
Government began to assume a greater role in designing, contracting and even managing sector works. This&#13;
marked the beginning of "growing centralism" which was formalized in 1936 with the creation of a special water&#13;
division in the Ministry of Public Works with tasks which included the design and supervision of infrastructure&#13;
works. As the need for a more specialized finance sector entity became apparent, the Government established the&#13;
Fondo de Fomento Municipal in 1940 to finance water works, supervise construction and approve sector studies,&#13;
plans and budgets.&#13;
13.  The Instituto de Fomento Municipal (INSFOPAL) was later created with responsibilities for designing,&#13;
financing and contracting sector works in several urban areas. INSFOPAL opened offices in each Departmental&#13;
capital and became the main sector entity during this penod. With growing concern that the water needs of rural&#13;
areas were not being attended, in 1968 the Government established the Instituto Nacional para Prograrnas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Especiales de Salud (INPES) im the Ministry of Health to attend to such needs. The Government thus&#13;
consolidated its position as the principal actor im the sector throughout the country&#13;
14.  Attempts to provide greater autonomy for sector entities were initiated in 1975 after a new government&#13;
canie into office. The regional offices of INSFOPAL were renamed Empresas de Obras Sanitanas (EMPOS)&#13;
and the central unit of INSFOPAL was then supposed to relinquish its direct intervention in the sector and&#13;
become a national coordinating and general assistance entity However, the weak state of many local EMPOS&#13;
resulted in INSFOPAL continuing with its administrative, executing, control and financing role. By the early&#13;
1980s the system was in a deep financial crisis and in 1987 the Government decided to abolish INSFOPAL and&#13;
transfer the assets of the EMPOS to the local authorities. Financing for sector entities followed a similar&#13;
changing path where, between 1976 and 1987 there were four different ministries with financing responsibility for&#13;
sector activities.&#13;
15.  As outlined in the 1991-1994 Development Plan, the Government's main sector goals were: (a)&#13;
restructuring of existing institutions to promote further decentralization; (b) increasing national household&#13;
coverage for water and sewerage services; (c) improving the quality of treated drinking water from public&#13;
systems; and, (d) formulating and initiating implementation of a wastewater treatment strategy for the&#13;
largest cities.&#13;
16.  Estimates of financial needs for the plan period were put at about US$930 million (not including&#13;
pollution control and sanitation activities in the five largest cities, which were to be studied and financed&#13;
separately). Of the US$930 million, about US$440 million were to be either credit or own resources of the&#13;
four largest metropolitan areas; about US$150 million were to be from the Bank's ongoing water supply&#13;
and sewerage sector loan (2961-CO); US$80 million were expected from central government subsidies to&#13;
areas which made special efforts to capture counterpart resources; and the rest was to be from local&#13;
counterpart sources, grants from the Integrated Rural Development Fund (DRI), credits from the Caja&#13;
Agraria for rural works and to a lesser degree from the Regional Development Corporations (CORPES),&#13;
Departmental Governments, the Ministry of Health, and UNDP assistance. As of the end of 1993,&#13;
approximately, 65% of the above forecast of investments had been executed by the authorities. By the end&#13;
of 1994, approximately 80% of the planned investments were expected to be completed.&#13;
17.  Despite the increasing levels of investment flows into the sector, continuing administrative&#13;
weaknesses and inefficiencies are adding to the overall cost of delivery and contributing to premature and&#13;
costly additions to capacity. In particular, continuing high levels of Unaccounted-for-Water (UFW) in the&#13;
major municipal systems are leading to high operating costs, low revenues and increasing vulnerability of&#13;
service due to capacity and distribution constraints. The high levels of UFW are attributed to a large extent&#13;
to inefficient and fraudulent commercial practices, as well as to system deficiencies caused by inadequate&#13;
maintenance. The new Public Services Law has been designed to arrest these tendencies by forcing&#13;
municipal governments to create financially and administratively autonomous public utilities, by&#13;
accelerating the introduction of the private sector in the provision of public services and by instilling&#13;
financial and managerial accountability and responsibility. The proposed project directly responds to these&#13;
above general concerns, which have been most acutely felt in the Bogota Capital District.&#13;
2.     Bogota-Specific Issues&#13;
18.  Demand: The major issue facing the Capital District of Santafe de Bogota (Bogota) is the rapid&#13;
growth in water demand that will require major investments in developing new and more costly water&#13;
sources to avoid rationing in the near future. In 1994, BogotA (including the surrounding municipalities)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
had a population of 6.5 million, growing at a rate of 2.7 percent p.a. The urban population is projected to&#13;
reach 8.0 million by the end of the century and lose to 10 million by the year 2010. A detailed analysis of&#13;
population and demand projections is presented in Annex 1. According to official statistics, there are some&#13;
one million urban poor in the Capital District. It is also estimated that some 100,000 lack access to&#13;
adequate water supply services and about 750,000 to adequate sanitary toilet facilities. In addition, an&#13;
estimated 500,000 live close to highly polluted water courses, the Bogota River and its tributaries that run&#13;
through the city, or in low areas prone to frequent flooding. Recent studies commissioned by EAAB show&#13;
that, under the present rate of growth of demand, existing water sources can at best serve the needs of the&#13;
Capital district and the surrounding municipalities through the year 2014 (assuming continued decline in&#13;
the UFW, (see para. below)). Although better demand management would slow the pace of growth of&#13;
demand, the sheer increase in population and income levels will continue to put pressure on the authorities&#13;
to develop new water sources.&#13;
19.  Water Supply: Service coverage in the capital area (for details see Annex 2) is high by national&#13;
standards. According to the 1993 census, 88% of the urban population of Bogota had access to water&#13;
supply services by house connection. The main issue facing the EAAB is the rapid increase in&#13;
unaccounted for water (UFW) from 22% in the early 1970's to about 42% in 1990; UFW was about&#13;
40% at the beginning of 1994. EAAB, under a study financed under the Bogota IV project (Loan 2512-&#13;
CO), assessed the causes of this high UFW. The main cause, which accounts for about 65% of the UFW, is&#13;
related to problems in the commercial system i.e., illegal connections, inaccurate consumer records,&#13;
software tampering and faulty meters. The rest (35%) is mostly caused by leaks in the distribution system&#13;
and house connections and problems with macrometering. Based on these findings, EAAB has developed a&#13;
comprehensive plan to reduce UFW to about 25% by the year 2000. Implementation of this plan has&#13;
begun as an integral part of the Santafe I Project.&#13;
20.  Given the relative size and strength of EAAB and the large economies of scale in water production, it&#13;
is likely that its sphere of influence in the savanna of Bogota region will grow over time (see Annex 2).&#13;
Water production capacity is limited to about 65% of the nominal capacity (836 million m3/year) because&#13;
of constraints in the Tibito system. About 66% of the nominal capacity was utilized in 1992. The quality of&#13;
water of the supply sources ranges from excellent as in the case of the Chingaza system that provides 55%&#13;
of the system's capacity and comes from a highly protected and thinly populated area, to the Tibito system&#13;
that provides 42% of nominal capacity, located in a relatively unprotected area subject to moderate levels&#13;
of urban and industrial pollution. All water supplies are treated and chlorinated to meet or exceed WHO&#13;
drinking water quality guidelines and there is a water testing and monitoring program to ensure that water&#13;
provided to consumers meets these standards. In addition, there is a pollution abatement program under&#13;
execution in the upper basin of the Bogota River that will improve the raw water quality at Tibito. The&#13;
main issue in this regard is the vulnerability of the primary water distribution system from the two main&#13;
sources (i.e., Tibito and Wiesner treatment plants)2 to potential breakdowns with consequent disastrous&#13;
effects on EAAB's ability to meet the average daily demand without resorting to water rationing for&#13;
prolonged periods (Annex 2). The project addresses this particular issue with special emphasis on reducing&#13;
system vulnerability.&#13;
2 The 75 km Tibito pipeline has well-documented structural deficiencies that remain highly vulnerable. Th epipeline shows a&#13;
staedy increase in ruptires even at the present opearting flows which are less than 40% of the design flow due to the inability of&#13;
the Tibito plant to deliver its rated capacity. The Usaquen tunnel is vulnerable due to the lack of a back-up facility in case of&#13;
failure. The present Usaquen tunnel provides the only outlet for nearly 70% of the water delivered into the EAAB system from&#13;
the Wiesner plant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
21.  Sewerage and Drainage. Coverage of the sewerage systems, also high by national standards, reaches&#13;
85% of the population (see Annex 2). The drainage system covers about 70% of the population. However,&#13;
low lying areas of the city are subject to periodic flooding, exacerbated in part by control structures on the&#13;
Bogota River needed to satisfy irrigation and hydroelectric power generation requirements. The sewerage&#13;
and drainage systems are combined in the old sections of the city. In other areas, sewerage and drainage are&#13;
separated. In practice, due to lax enforcement, many illicit or unauthorized connections have been made to&#13;
the two systems and therefore they operate, to some extent, as a combined system. The problem created by&#13;
these illicit connections will be studied in detail as part of the proposed studies to reduce pollution in the&#13;
Bogota River, as they are a determining factor in the definition of specific remedial actions. A detailed&#13;
discussion of water-related environmental issues in the Bogota Metropolitan area is found in Annex 3.&#13;
22.  The domestic and some of the industrial waste water generated in the Bogota area is finally collected&#13;
by interceptors parallel to existing natural water courses that discharge their waters, without treatment,&#13;
directly back to these courses below populated areas. As the city has expanded, some of these discharges&#13;
are now being made in densely populated areas, thus preventing an orderly urban growth. In addition,&#13;
overflows of the combined sewerage system are also often discharged, under all weather conditions, to the&#13;
drainage canals in densely populated areas. These conditions are detrimental to a pleasant urban&#13;
environment, and they also pose high health risks to the population.&#13;
D.    Lessons from Bank Experience&#13;
23.  Since 1968, the Bank has made 13 loans totaling about US$555 million for water supply and&#13;
sewerage development in Colombia. About 60% of total Bank loan funds (US$337.8 million) were granted&#13;
to five municipal water companies (in Bogota, Cali, Barranquilla, Cucuta and Palnira) through nine&#13;
separate operations. By far, the largest borrower has been the Bogota Water and Sewerage Company&#13;
(EAAB) to which the Bank has lent US$261 million in four lending operations.&#13;
24.  At present, the Bank is supporting sector investments through projects with the Empresas&#13;
Municipales de Cucuta in Cucuta (Loan 2470-CO), as well as a multi-city lending operation through the&#13;
new national financial intermediary for municipal development, FINDETER (Loan 296 1-CO) for the&#13;
financing of about 300 sub-projects in medium and small communities.&#13;
25.  Lessons learned from implementation of previous and ongoing projects (see Annex 4) were applied in&#13;
the preparation of the Santafe I, where greater care was given to estimating water demand and consumption&#13;
levels, to undertaking more detailed surveys for complex works prior to bidding, and to adopting a more&#13;
realistic implementation schedule than in the past projects. A comprehensive set of systemic solutions and&#13;
structural changes have been agreed and are now being implemented.&#13;
26.  Overall, the main lesson from previous Bank projects with EAAB, and particularly Bogota IV, is&#13;
that institutional and financial issues must be addressed up-front, with the evolution of a strategic&#13;
consensus between key actors and the initiation of substantive actions, which can then be consolidated and&#13;
developed in a phased manner. This lesson is being applied in the proposed project, with the focus on&#13;
structural and systemic reforms. At the same time, the proposed project reinforces the focus on structural&#13;
reforms through a time-bound Action Plan, with a set of monitoring indicators (see paras 78. and 88, and&#13;
Annex 14) that will follow the progress of the reform process, leading to the ultimate structural and&#13;
corporate transformation of EAAB. The decision to phase the Bank's financing for the entire Santafe I&#13;
project reflects lessons learned from past Bank experience as well. The second phase of Bank financing&#13;
would be linked to progress made by EAAB in achieving its Action Plan targets early on during project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
implementation and to a comprehensive review of progress (expected to be carried out after September 30,&#13;
1997) in both physical implementation of the Santafe I project as well as in the implementation of&#13;
organizational and operational reforms.&#13;
H.    Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Bogoti ESP (EAAB)&#13;
A.    General&#13;
27.  The Borrower and implementing agency would be the Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de&#13;
Bogot,a, ESP (EAAB). EAAB was, until recently (see para. 32.), an autonomous municipal agency owned&#13;
by the Bogota Capital District. It has now been reconstituted as a Public Service Company of an Industrial&#13;
and Commercial character as defined by the new Public Services Law and by the Organic Statutes of the&#13;
Bogota Capital District. A full description of EAAB and an assessment of its institutional capabilities is&#13;
presented in Annex 5.&#13;
28.  From the early 1970's, EAAB grew rapidly and extended service coverage from an estimated 60% of&#13;
the population in 1970 to over 85% by 1993, thanks in part to the implementation of the first four Bank-&#13;
financed projects (see Annex 4). Water quality reached intemational standards and sewerage was extended&#13;
to nearly 80% of the population. Nevertheless, during the course of execution of the Bogota IV project,&#13;
political interference increased, and, despite new investments in the water and sewerage system, EAAB's&#13;
operations began to suffer greater inefficiencies, staff levels ballooned, maintenance was neglected as&#13;
operating revenues failed to keep pace with rising costs (see para. 29 below).&#13;
B.    Recent Financial Performance&#13;
29.  EAAB's financial situation steadily deteriorated during the period 1988-92, mainly as a result of cost&#13;
overruns in its construction program, which were financed with short-term debt, maturing long-term debt,&#13;
and high and increasing labor costs. Thus, in 1990 debt service was twice the level it had been in 1989 and&#13;
doubled again in 1991; by 1992, labor costs had increased to 67% of working expenses from about 55% in&#13;
1989. Net income continued to fall during this period and cash generation was increasingly insufficient to&#13;
cover EAAB's heavy capital expenditure program and increasing debt service obligations. Table 1 below&#13;
summarizes EAAB's financial performance over the past 5 years.&#13;

30.   For several years, under the Bogota IV project, the Bank signaled the urgency of corrective actions,&#13;
and attempted to secure compliance with covenanted conditionality regarding financial performance. In&#13;
1991, EAAB started a financial restructuring exercise which was part of a broad Action Plan. Water rates&#13;
were increased in real terms in 1991 and in 1992, and EAAB decreased its labor costs and its operating&#13;
expenses, and obtained a long-term credit on concessional terms to complete the Bogota IV project.&#13;
However, these measures were insufficient to arrest the deterioration of its financial situation. The internal&#13;
deficit widened in 1992 and by end 1992, EAAB had accumulated arrears to suppliers and contractors&#13;
estimated at about Col.$ 22,000 million (about US$ 30 million). It was also unable to fund its construction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
programn, and experienced difficulties in meeting its debt service obligations. Throughout this period,&#13;
EAAB operated with poor liquidity margins as evidenced by a Quick Ratio 3 far below 1.&#13;
31.  This difficult financial situation was confronted by the National Govermnent in 1993, when it&#13;
decided to rescue EAAB and refinanced almost the entire foreign debt service becoming due in the second&#13;
half of 1993, and in the years 1994 to 1997 as part of a broader agreement for restructuring EAAB to&#13;
achieve greater efficiency and accountability through a legally binding Performance Plan. In 1993, as a&#13;
consequence of this arrangement with the National Government, which effectively covered over 25% of the&#13;
total debt service in that year, EAAB was able to generate net internal funds after debt service equivalent&#13;
to about 73% of its investments4. At year-end 1994, EAAB showed a substantial level of surplus liquidity,&#13;
available for initiating a significant investment program. Other elements contributing to EAAB's financial&#13;
recovery during 1993 and continuing into 1994, have been the payment to EAAB by the National and&#13;
Capital District Governments of arrears on water sales, a drive to increase collections from customers and&#13;
eliminate illegal connections, all parts of the Performance Plan.&#13;
C.     Institutional Changes&#13;
32. The National Government and the Mayor of Bogota also took positive steps towards the resolution&#13;
of the underlying structural, institutional and financial, issues which led to EAAB's financial crisis in&#13;
1989-92. In July 1993, the Government enacted the Decree-Law (Decreto-Ley 1421, July 21, 1993) that&#13;
redefined the organization and by laws of the Capital District and its public service companies. A salient&#13;
point of this decreto-ley is that accountability of the Mayor and the General Managers of the city's service&#13;
companies has been sharply increased. The newly enacted Public Services Law has further strengthened&#13;
EAAB's autonomy in these crucial aspects, and which mandates that all public utility companies be&#13;
organized as either municipal commercial and industrial enterprises or be transformed into shareholding&#13;
companies with significant inputs of private capital. As a consequence, although the Mayor approves&#13;
EAAB's budget (through the Capital District's social and economic council -CONFIS-) and appoints the&#13;
General Manager and members of the Board, the General Manager of EAAB now has, for the first time,&#13;
full responsibility for managing the utility under policies formulated by its Board of Directors,&#13;
representing not only the interests of the City Council as owner, but the general public as users as well.&#13;
33.   EAAB's recent institutional restructuring will help restore the basic viability of a major public&#13;
utility in the capital, strengthen its ability to respond adequately to unmet needs for rehabilitation and&#13;
modest expansion of the water distribution and sewerage network, as well as, to the complex demands over&#13;
the medium-term for pollution control and treatment. Moreover, by improving efficiency (especially,&#13;
through reducing unaccounted for water, and effectively anticipating and meeting longer-term liquidity&#13;
concems), it will also build up the institutional and financial capability to undertake the needed capacity&#13;
expansion investments in the longer-term. However, management turnover is still a major problem facing&#13;
EAAB. The last four General Managers and their core teams have spent an average of 18 months or less in&#13;
their positions. The Public Services Law will not remedy this situation except insofar as Municipal&#13;
authorities reconstitute utility entities into shareholding corporations. The proposed study for institutional&#13;
altematives for EAAB will examine ways in which the institutional structure and govemance of EAAB can&#13;
be stabilized for the longer-term in order to enable the utility to meet its major challenges in the years&#13;
3 for a definition of the Quick Ratio see footnote in para 54.&#13;
4 The self financing ratio in 1993 is calculated on the same basis as in prior years, ie. (Gross Internal Cash Generation-Debt&#13;
Service)/Investments, thereby not taking into account the financing support from thenational government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
ahead, in particular, the need to undertake large-scale investments going well into the next decade and to&#13;
raise long term capital. As the detailed provisions of the new Public Services Law are implemented,&#13;
EAAB's working practices in a number of key operating and strategic areas will need to be modified, either&#13;
through internal reorganization, or more likely through unbundling of many of the functions that are carried&#13;
out by itself. A start towards this unbundling and towards introduction of the private sector into the&#13;
operations is being made under the Santafe I project. (see para. 35. and below).&#13;
D.    Performance Plan&#13;
34.  The National Government, the Mayor and EAAB have entered into a Performance Plan (PP) (Plan&#13;
de Desempefio), that sets stringent objectives for EAAB over the next seven years. This plan, discussed&#13;
with the Bank, sets the obligations of EAAB and, by extension, of the Mayor to improve the overall&#13;
performance of EAAB. The main features of the PP are explicit performance indicators in key areas,&#13;
provision for independent monitoring and follow-up at a high level, and sanctions in the case of non-&#13;
compliance. Users' pressure for quality service and efficiency and expanded accountability will be&#13;
promoted through the mandatory disclosure of key data on EAAB performance (financial situation, labor&#13;
agreements and costs, time to attend to customers' complaints, service coverage, UFW, etc.). As detailed&#13;
in para. 78. a set of monitoring indicators for the performance of EAAB in key institutional and financial&#13;
aspects and specific indicators related to the implementation of the Santaf6 I project has been set forth.&#13;
These indicators are consistent with the targets set in the PP.&#13;
E.    Private Sector Participation&#13;
35.  An important dimension of the restructuring process of EAAB is to give a more significant role to&#13;
the private sector in the traditional operating areas of EAAB. As initially conceived, this process would&#13;
involve letting out private concessions for selected aspects of EAAB's operations. EAAB has now begun&#13;
studies to determine the most suitable areas for potential concessions (in particular, the rehabilitation of the&#13;
Tibito treatment plant and the Usaquen tunnel were identified in the early stages of project preparation as&#13;
potentially attractive candidates), while at the same time the study of institutional adjustment alternatives&#13;
will be used to examine the issue of private sector participation in a broader context. As individual&#13;
proposals are put forward, the implications on the financing plan for the project will be reviewed with the&#13;
Bank on a case by case basis and adjustments made in the allocation of the Bank loan proceeds in the event&#13;
specific elements of the Santafe I project should be more attractive to private sector concessions. In the&#13;
meantime, EAAB has already begun to examine the scope for sub-contracting with the private sector many&#13;
activities now being carried out by its own workforce. Some of these activities have recently been&#13;
contracted to the private sector with considerable gains in efficiency and a decline in the number of&#13;
complaints. EAAB has presented a plan, acceptable to the Bank, to increase private sector participation&#13;
through concessions and service contracts in many areas (see Annex 6).&#13;
36.  In spite of the high degree of autonomy already achieved, the National Government, the Capital&#13;
District, EAAB and the Bank have agreed that further consolidation of structural reforms and autonomy&#13;
and efficiency gains in EAAB would best be achieved through transformation of the enterprise into a share-&#13;
holding company with substantial divestment of the Capital District's ownership. The precise form of this&#13;
corporate identity will need to be studied keeping in mind the possible privatization options being tested in&#13;
various Colombian and Latin American cities with respect to public utility companies and recognizing that&#13;
EAAB's major problems lie in the inefficiencies of its management structures and its erstwhile lack of&#13;
autonomy and insulation from political interference, rather than technical incompetence or insufficient&#13;
coverage. These issues would be addressed by a detailed and comprehensive study of EAAB's institutional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
adjustment which is proposed under the Technical Assistance component of the project. Additional&#13;
information regarding EAAB's institutional adjustment is presented in Annex 6.&#13;
37.  The objective of the study will be to propose a new institutional framework under which enhanced&#13;
autonomy and efficiency levels would be attained, as well as to help implement the recommended&#13;
alternative after the relevant decisions are taken. The study will examine the longer-term urban growth&#13;
prospects for the Bogota metropolitan area and determine the optimal investment strategies in respect of&#13;
water and sanitation infrastructure within known developmental and technological constraints, and&#13;
recommend the likely long-term institutional structures that will best serve the needs of the population at&#13;
acceptable cost. It will take into consideration the financing needs for future expansion of service and&#13;
propose financial and institutional schemes to make the financial sources viable. The study will recommend&#13;
the medium and long-term structural changes that will best prepare EAAB and the Bogota metropolitan&#13;
area to meet the challenges of the next century. This study will take advantage of all new possibilities&#13;
provided under the Law 142 and will consider all major institutional alternatives for EAAB, from not&#13;
changing the company's current status, to different formns and levels of private sector participation&#13;
including widening the company's ownership through public stock issue. It will also consider separating the&#13;
production from the distribution function. The study will outline an action plan for implementing the&#13;
recommended structural adjustment of EAAB. Activities towards implementation of the plan would initiate&#13;
if the recommendations of the study and the proposed action plan would be acceptable to the Colombian&#13;
and Capital District authorities and to the Bank. During negotiations, agreements were reached on the&#13;
following: (i) a schedule for the study; (ii) the establishment of an independent Steering Committee&#13;
comprising prominent citizens of Bogota drawn from the public and private sectors and including technical&#13;
and institutional experts who can provide advice and direction for the conduct of the study, and for its&#13;
guidance through the political decision-making process; and (iii) the commitment of the Colombian&#13;
authorities to implement the study's recommendations, if found acceptable.&#13;
m.   The Project&#13;
A.    Background&#13;
38.  The proposed project would be the fifth operation with EAAB financed by the Bank. The project&#13;
builds particularly on the last two operations where preparatory work was done in the formulation of the&#13;
water distribution network and sewerage master plans as well as on the identification of the causes of&#13;
unaccounted for water (UFW).&#13;
B.    Project Objectives and Rationale&#13;
39.  The key objective of the project is to support and consolidate the transition of EAAB from a&#13;
technically capable but operationally inefficient public service agency to a commercially-run public utility&#13;
company, sensitive to the demands of the market, and with a corporate culture based on professional&#13;
responsibility and accountability. The project would build on the important steps recently taken by the&#13;
Government through the new Public Services Law to enhance operational efficiency, provide broader&#13;
mnanagerial autonomy and responsibility, reduce political interference, and increase public accountability&#13;
of municipal utilities such as EAAB. The transition to a corporate culture would prepare the way for a&#13;
longer-term structural transfornation of the company, including, inter alia, participation of private sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
capital in the future provision and operation of the Capital's water and sewerage services. A key incentive&#13;
for this transition has already been put in place by the national Government in 1993, with the signing of the&#13;
Performance Plan (see paras. 31 &amp; 34.) . Compliance with the operational targets in the Performance&#13;
Plan is being monitored on a quarterly basis by independent external auditors commissioned by the&#13;
National Government. As a follow up to the above institutional transition, the project is also supporting&#13;
EAAB in defining the longer-term framework of institutional changes and economic tariff structures that&#13;
would be needed to adequately finance and implement major new investments in water supply, sewerage&#13;
and especially wastewater treatment in the Capital District and its surrounding municipalities over the next&#13;
20-30 years, when the current population of over 6.5 million is expected to nearly double in size. In&#13;
addition to this key institutional objective, the project has a number of specific objectives which include,&#13;
(a) expanding distribution services to the urban poor, in particular, targeting more effectively the lowest&#13;
income groups in the metropolitan area; (b) addressing major environmental concerns of the heavily&#13;
polluted Bogota River; (c) reducing the vulnerability of the Bogota water supply system; and, (d)&#13;
supporting a revamped economic and its tariff framework which enables EAAB to reflect the full cost of&#13;
providing its services. Progress towards meeting these objectives will be monitored within the framework&#13;
of the Action Plan discussed in paragraph 88. The project objectives are thus fully consistent with the&#13;
country assistance strategy for Colombia and the choice of the project fits well within the context of the&#13;
Regional Infrastructure initiative.&#13;
40.  In line with the above objectives, the project would specifically focus on the following actions:&#13;
*      Inmprove water, sewerage and storm water drainage services in Bogota, with special emphasis&#13;
on sub-normal service zones inhabited by population of low income, through optimization of the&#13;
operation of the existing water supply system and expansion and rehabilitation of the sewerage&#13;
and storm water drainage networks;&#13;
*      Improve the reliability of the Bogota water supply system and reduce n'sks of water rationing;&#13;
*      Support EAAB in the institutional and financial restructuring and strengthening program,&#13;
thereby increasing efficiency in operations and achieving and consolidating financial viability;&#13;
*      Strengthen wetlands management and environmental protection and enhance EAAB sensitivity&#13;
to enviromental concerns;&#13;
*      Provide technical assistance and consulting services to support project implementation and&#13;
prepare future investment programs&#13;
*      Support EAAB in carrying out a comprehensive study to explore promising institutional&#13;
alternatives for the company aimed at enhancing its autonomy and efficiency;&#13;

D.    Project Cost&#13;
42.  The total project cost is estimated at US$ 717.9 million equivalent, including physical and price&#13;
contingencies, and duties and taxes, estimated at US$ 66.9 million equivalent. The proposed two Bank&#13;
loans totaling US$ 145.0 million will finance the first phase of the Santafe I investment program (1995-98)&#13;
equivalent to 38.7% of project cost net of duties and taxes and excluding interest on the Bank loans. A&#13;
summary of project costs is presented in Table 2, and a detailed estimate is given in Annex 8.&#13;
43.  Project costs for all construction and equipment purchase components are based on detailed designs&#13;
that cover about 45% of the works and on unit costs of similar project components in the project area. Base&#13;
prices are based on current prices of June 1993. Physical contingencies amounting to an average of 10% of&#13;
base cost were added to all project components. Price contingencies were calculated for a project execution&#13;
period of seven years, at a local inflation rate of 21% in 1993, 22% in 1994, 18% in 1995, 16% in 1996,&#13;
14% in 1997, and 12% in the other years, and projected intemational inflation rates as shown in Annex&#13;

E.      Economic Evaluation&#13;
1.      Project Justification and Benefits&#13;
44.   The economic justification for the project is based on the benefits it would generate in the form of&#13;
higher water sales and cost savings ftom investments that promote efficiency in water supply and sewerage.&#13;
These benefits will mainly stem from the rehabilitation of the water supply and sewerage network] and the&#13;
implementation of the water loss reduction program, that will result in an increase of the available water&#13;
supply. The project would also foster a number of non-quantifiable benefits. The lack of reliable data have&#13;
precluded a quantitative estimation of these benefits. These benefits include health benefits, environmental&#13;
benefits (including reduction of the contamination of the main water courses and the reduction of&#13;
environmental damage to fragile wetlands ecosystems), cost savings from postponed investment, increased&#13;
property values in flood prone areas, and benefits associated with the institutional strengthening of the&#13;
capacity of EAAB to plan and manage its resources.&#13;
45.   The main assumptions underlying the analysis is the definition of the 'with' and 'without project'&#13;
situation. The incremental revenues from the sale of future water and sewerage services have been used as&#13;
a proxy for direct-use benefits. To ensure financial viability, the average tariff has to be gradually&#13;
increased to US$0.48 per cubic meter in 1998. The investment costs have been discussed in more detail in&#13;
paragraphs 42 and 43, and in Annex 8. It should be noted that the proposed investment program is the&#13;
least-cost option to expand the production capacity. The calculation of the fixed operation and maintenance&#13;
costs is based upon the assumption that an increase in effective production capacity will not require any&#13;
additional staff and thus can be limited to 1.5 percent of the accumulated investment costs. The variable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
operational and maintenance costs will increase due to the higher energy and chemical costs that are&#13;
required in the Tibito plant.&#13;
46.  To reflect true costs and benefits, financial prices have been transformed into economic prices. The&#13;
major difference between financial and economic prices involves the impact of taxes and subsidies. A&#13;
discount rate of 10 percent is used to calculate the net present value. Based upon these assumptions, the net&#13;
present value of the project is US$ 209 million, the internal economic rate of return is 17 percent, and the&#13;
benefit-cost ratio is 1.49. The impact of changes in a number of key variables have been analyzed, and are&#13;
presented in the table below. This sensitivity analysis shows that the results of the cost-benefit analysis are&#13;
rather solid.&#13;

Price elasticity of demand at -0.30  192          16%              1.46&#13;
47.  Marginal cost pricing has been increasingly promulgated as a basis for tariff setting. The long-run&#13;
average incremental cost of the project has been estimated at US$0.55 per cubic meter consumed. This is&#13;
higher than the current water and sewerage rate, which currently stands at US$0.44 per cubic meter&#13;
consumed. In order to promote an efficient allocation of resources, average water and sewerage rates need&#13;
therefore to be increased during the project implementation period. When the production capacity generated&#13;
under this program is insufficient to satisfy future demand, EAAB would have to resort to very expansive&#13;
investment altematives, such as the Chingaza or the Sumapaz Alto Muna expansion. The long-run average&#13;
incremental cost of these expansion programs could result in a quadrupling of the average tariffs. The high&#13;
costs of such new investment projects could have major implications and should be considered in future&#13;
sector strategies.&#13;
F.    Financial Analysis&#13;
1.    Project Financing Plan&#13;
48.  The financing plan of the first phase of the Santafe I Investment Program is presented in Table 4.&#13;
The proposed Bank loans totaling US$ 145 million represents 38.7% of these first phase project cost, net&#13;
of taxes, and would help finance the first phase of project implementation (1995-98). The Bank has&#13;
indicated to the Government that it would consider a request for further loan(s) to help finance the&#13;
remaining period of the project. The private sector is expected to finance US$ 30 million of this first&#13;
phase project cost. An additional amount of US$ 119 million will be allocated by the Capital District from&#13;
the recently mandated transfers from the National Government under Law 60. The timing of these&#13;
transfers has been formally agreed between the National government, the Capital District and EAAB.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
During negotiations confirmation of the amount and schedule of transfers from the Capital District was&#13;
obtained and referenced in the Loan Agreements and in the Sponsor Agreements with the Capital District.&#13;
The balance of US$120.3 million (about 29 % of total project cost, including duties and taxes) will be&#13;
provided by EAAB's internal cash generation, which is expected to be sufficient. The two Bank loans and&#13;
portions of EAAB's and the private sector's financing will cover the foreign exchange component of the&#13;
project.&#13;

49.  Out of the proposed loans, a maximum amount of US$ 14.5 million (10% of the total loans) would&#13;
be available for retroactive financing of urgent works of water supply, sewage collection and flood control,&#13;
and for completion of designs of work to be implemented under the project. Eligibility for retroactive&#13;
financing would apply to all works, goods and consulting services that are procured under procurement&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank, before signature of the Loan Agreements, but not earlier than the later&#13;
of September 1, 1994 or 12 months before the corresponding loans' signing date.&#13;
50.  EAAB has appointed consultants to prepare the bidding documents for a concession for&#13;
rehabilitation and operation of the Tibito water treatment plant, with an estimated investment of US$ 25&#13;
million in rehabilitation works. EAAB is also considering a concession for construction and operation of&#13;
hydroelectric power plant linked to the alternate Usaquen tunnel, which includes an estimated investment of&#13;
US$ 15 million for construction of the tunnel, of which an estimated amount of US$ 10 million can be&#13;
recovered through power generation. A final decision in regard to the Usaquen concession will be taken on&#13;
the basis of results of a pre-feasibility study which is currently being prepared. It is possible that should&#13;
these concessions materialize, private sector participation in the financing of the Santafe I project could&#13;
increase beyond the amount currently indicated (U$ 30 million). Private sector financing is also possible&#13;
through supplier/buyer financing arrangements that might be offered for some of the equipment and&#13;
material supplies. In addition to the above possibilities which are under study, the private sector is also&#13;
expected to participate in project financing through a service contract for supply, installation and&#13;
maintenance of domestic water meters, with an estimated investment of US$ 15 million in supply of the&#13;
meters.&#13;

52.   The results of the financial analysis confirm the viability of implementing the proposed project of&#13;
US$ 717.9 million, for which the envisaged funding mix will be adequate, with indebtedness remaining at&#13;
extremely prudent limits, as shown in Annex 10. Salient features of EAAB's forecast financial&#13;
performance are as follows:5&#13;
*  Operating revenues are expected to grow at a faster pace than in recent years, reflecting&#13;
higher population growth, implementation of the UFW reduction program, and the&#13;
aggressive commercial action by EAAB to regularize the nearly 200,000 illegal&#13;
connections and update the customer database over the next seven years;&#13;
*  Operating costs are expected to grow more modestly, as the impact of lower personnel&#13;
levels, shift of newer personnel into non-unionized contracts and greater operating&#13;
efficiency are felt; labor costs as a percent of working expenses rises modestly reflecting&#13;
the legally mandated treatment of pensions (see para. 55. below), from 67% in 1993&#13;
(para 29), to 70% in 1995, and hovers at that level throughout the projection period;&#13;
however, with improved efficiencies in billing and collections, labor productivity is&#13;
expected to grow rapidly in the forecast period (see Annex 10, Table 5 for relevant&#13;
statistics and indicators of productivity and performance);&#13;
*  In addition to the Santafe I Project investments, EAAB is expected to begin investments in&#13;
developing new water sources starting in 1997, and to complete ongoing investment&#13;
projects through 1998. These programs will impose additional cash burdens on EAAB.&#13;
However, due to the infusion of funds from the National Government to cover EAAB's&#13;
estimated debt service payments on the existing foreign debt through 1997 ( para 31 ),&#13;
EAAB's cash flow is expected to be sufficient to cover these needs during the critical&#13;
period from 1995-1998.&#13;
*  The forecasts show that increases in water and sewerage tariffs in real terms of about 3%&#13;
in 1996 and 2.5% each year in 1997 and 1998 will be required in order to enable EAAB&#13;
to meet its investment obligations and maintain sound liquidity. However, further tariff&#13;
increases in real terms and tariff structure adjustments will be needed beyond that period&#13;
if EAAB is to reduce existing distortions in the tariff structure and meet the minimal&#13;
requirements of full cost coverage as stipulated in Public Services Law. As detailed in&#13;
Annex 11, an analysis of EAAB's tariff structure reveals distortions that will need to be&#13;
corrected in the near future in order to comply with the Public Services Law that&#13;
stipulates the levels of cross-subsidization permitted in tariffs and rates of public utility&#13;
providers. The impact of tariff structure changes is expected to provide EAAB with&#13;
higher levels of operating revenues as more than 50% of EAAB customers are in the&#13;
lowest tariff classes for whom the cross-subsidies will need to be eliminated by at least&#13;
half, and the remaining subsidies covered by explicit transfers from the municipality out&#13;
of the oil royalty allocations. The potential increases in tariffs in real terms could be&#13;
effected by a combination of absolute increases across all classes of customers and by&#13;
judicious adjustments in the structure itself.&#13;
5 Net Income is shown prior to monetary corrections and inflation adjustments in order to ensure comparability with prior&#13;
period data. However, the rate of return is calculated on the basis of adjusted figures and revalued (inflation adjusted) net&#13;
fixed assets in use. See Annex 10 for details. See also Footnote in para. 29 regarding the self financing ratio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
* Provided EAAB is able to effect the needed tariff adjustments in real terms, the main&#13;
financial ratios are expected to remain within satisfactory ranges throughout the forecast&#13;
period.&#13;
3.     Tariff Structure and Main Financial Covenants&#13;
53.  Annex 11 describes EAAB's current structure of water and sewerage tariffs. After several years of&#13;
inadequate tariff levels, EAAB was able to obtain average tariff increases of 5% in real terms in each of&#13;
1992 and 1993. In 1994, tariffs on bulk sales to neighboring municipalities were increased by an average of&#13;
5% in real terms, while tariffs on retail sales in Bogota were adjusted at the inflation rate. Serious&#13;
structural deficiencies still remain. EAAB will carry out a study of the tariff structure as part of the&#13;
proposed project and the results will be incorporated into a revised tariff structure in 1996. Agreement&#13;
was reached during negotiations that EAAB will complete the tariff study not later than January 1, 1996,&#13;
and will begin to implement the recommendations of the study not later than March 31, 1996, with the first&#13;
revisions of the tariff structure occurring in 1996. However, given the extent of the distortions, and the&#13;
political sensitivity of making large adjustments affecting over 50% of the population with the lowest&#13;
incomes in the metropolitan area, EAAB and the District government expect that tariff adjustments will&#13;
require several years to be completed. EAAB has appointed consultants under terms of reference that were&#13;
reviewed and approved by the Bank. The study commenced in January 1995.&#13;
54. Agreement was also reached at negotiations, that, EAAB will take, and the Capital District and&#13;
National Governments will cause EAAB to take, such actions as are needed to meet the annual Working&#13;
Ratio6 Target incorporated as financial covenant in both Loan Agreements (Section 5.02 of the Loan&#13;
Agreements). In the event that the forecast of operating income for the following fiscal year shows&#13;
insufficiency in meeting the working ratio targets, EAAB will have to seek regulatory approval for&#13;
appropriate tariff adjustments. The National and Capital District Governments are obligated to take all&#13;
measures needed to enable EAAB to meet the corresponding targets. EAAB may however resort to short-&#13;
term borrowings to meet temporary liquidity problems, provided that the ratio of liquid current assets to&#13;
short-term liabilities (i.e., the Quick ratio) 7does not fall below 1.0 in 1996 and 1997 and not below 1.1 in&#13;
any year thereafter (incorporated as a covenant in Section 5.03 in both Loan Agreements).&#13;
4.     Pension Fund&#13;
55. As part of the Performance Plan agreement with the National Government, EAAB established an&#13;
Employee Pension Fund in 1994. During 1995, EAAB will make other mandated changes in its treatment&#13;
of future pensioners to comply with the recently enacted Colombian law on Social Security ( Law 100 of&#13;
1993). EAAB will continue to service pensions to its existing pool of pensioners (approximately 1250)&#13;
directly out of its annual operating revenues and use the revenues accruing in its Employee Pension Fund to&#13;
6 Working Ratio defined as Ratio of working expenses, prior to depreciation and interest charges, and including annual&#13;
payments to existing pensioners, payments into the EAAB Pension Fund, and annual transfers to external pension funds under&#13;
Law 100 to operating revenues prior to subsidy transfers and extra-ordinary income (including income from excess liquidity&#13;
balances).&#13;
7 Quick Ratio defined as the ratio of liquid assets (cash and bank balances and short-term investments readily convertible to&#13;
cash in three months and not more than 30% of accounts receivable) to current liabilities due and payable within one year,&#13;
including loan amortizations due and payable. The value of 30%/o of accounts receivable is appropriate because of the current&#13;
billing cycles that EAAB operates. Billings are sent out every two months and at anytime, the uncollected amounts represent&#13;
roughly 30% of the total accounts receivable outstanding from all customer accounts. In this calculation of the quick ratio, all&#13;
receivables due over 90 days are excluded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
partially offset use of its cash flow for this purpose. EAAB will need to continue its present practice of&#13;
using its annual cash flow to cover the pension payment obligations. At the same time, if there are excess&#13;
cash reserves due to improved bill collection, favorable investment returns on excess cash balances and&#13;
other extraordinary events, EAAB will continue to increase the corpus of the Employee Pension Fund in&#13;
order to provide an additional source of supplementary cash flow to cover its pension payment obligations&#13;
in particular years. EAAB will begin to contribute its share of social security and medical fund&#13;
contributions to the State Social Security scheme (or to alternative private pension funds that are&#13;
authorized to receive such contributions on the basis of individual employee elections under provisions of&#13;
the Social Security Law). EAAB will also become liable to transfer the entire actuarial liability balances&#13;
including accrued interest charges to the State Social Security Scheme or to authorized alternatives when&#13;
employees retire after December 31, 1995. As these liabilities are currently unfunded (and only partially&#13;
provisioned), EAAB will need to use its cash flow to effect these transfers. The forecast financial&#13;
statements reflect the provisions as outlined above, and take into account the increased cash outflows that&#13;
will be required. EAAB's pension liability will be fully provisioned within seven years as required by new&#13;
Colombian accounting rules. The cash flow arising from the annual provisioning will more than amply&#13;
cover EAAB's cash requirements to meet the present and future pension payment obligations. As EAAB's&#13;
pension liabilities remain largely unfunded, it is essential that water and sewerage rates cover the annual&#13;
cash flow requirements in this regard. The definition of the working ratio therefore includes this&#13;
requirement to ensure that tariff increases provide the adequate cash flow to EAAB to meet these essential&#13;
needs. The balance in the Pension Reserves is net of annual amortizations of accrued pension liabilities due&#13;
to pensioners leaving EAAB's pension plan, additions and reductions in numbers of pensioners and&#13;
estimated actuarial liabilities outstanding at each year end. The working ratio covenant (see para 54. ) will&#13;
cover this requirement. Agreement on the definition of the working ratio, incorporating the above cash&#13;
needs to meet EAAB's pension obligations was obtained during negotiations.&#13;
5.     Asset Revaluation and Financial Rate of Return&#13;
56. Under the Bogota IV project, the Bank required EAAB to carry out annual fixed asset reevaluations&#13;
and incorporate the results in the balance sheet. However, as Colombian accounting regulations did not&#13;
recognize such reevaluations in the case of public entities, EAAB continued to show the revaluation&#13;
amounts separately. Annual audits confirmed the practice but did not express an opinion. Colombian&#13;
accounting regulations were changed in 1992 to require all revenue-earning entities to adjust their asset&#13;
values by an inflation index and to adopt corrections in monetary items on the balance sheet as well. The&#13;
1993 audit has now effected prior-period adjustments to rectify errors in EAAB practice. EAAB will&#13;
continue to show the earlier asset reevaluations (ie. prior to 1992), as a separate unchanging line item.&#13;
Future year asset values will continue to be adjusted for inflation in accordance with the new regulations.&#13;
A rate of return covenant is not proposed at this time. Given the large investment programs that need to be&#13;
funded by EAAB cash generation, and the stringent Performance Plan targets on liquidity, collection&#13;
efficiency and UFW reduction, the working ratio and quick ratio covenants as stipulated in para. 54.&#13;
above are more meaningful. The financial projections show that under the assumptions and forecasts of&#13;
improvement in EAAB performance, the rate of return on revalued (inflation-adjusted) net fixed assets in&#13;
use rises from a negative 0.2% in 1994 to over 6 % in 2002. This is satisfactory, and reflects the&#13;
improvements in EAAB tariff structure and the impact of the project on efficiency and reliability of the&#13;
water system and of EAAB itself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
6.     Financial Risks and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
57.  In order to minimize the financial risk and to ensure that EAAB's financial recovery continues on the&#13;
path set out in the agreement with the Government to finance the external debt service obligations over&#13;
1993-1997, it is essential that the Performance Plan targets are met each year by EAAB. In addition to the&#13;
monitoring of the physical performance targets set forth for the project (see para. 89), the Bank would also&#13;
monitor the financial targets stipulated in the Action Plan and discussed in the preceding paragraphs.&#13;
These should ensure that EAAB's financial condition will improve steadily over the project implementation&#13;
period. Under the strict regimen of the proposed financial covenants and efficiency improvement targets,&#13;
the level of financial risk inherent in the project is acceptable. Finally, the phasing of the Bank's financing&#13;
of the Santafe I project provides a concrete instrument to monitor and limit the risk of non-compliance.&#13;
58.  Nevertheless, some concerns remain, in particular, that a serious breakdown in the vulnerable&#13;
sections of the system prior to the completion of the proposed rehabilitation investmnents, could lead to&#13;
substantial loss of revenues and extraordinary expenses for urgent repairs and for use of costly alternatives&#13;
in order to ensure water supply for the city. In order to mitigate against this risk, it was agreed during&#13;
negotiations, that in the unlikely event of their occurrence, the Capital District of Santafe de Bogota would&#13;
take such measures as are needed to ensure that the company continues to meet its obligations under the&#13;
Loan Agreement, particularly its financial covenants to have access to funds for carrying out emergency&#13;
repairs and other extraordinary measures as may be necessary under the project. In view of the vulnerable&#13;
elements of the water system and the potential for a catastrophic occurrence, however slim the probability,&#13;
the above covenant was incorporated in the Guarantee and Sponsor Agreements as measure to mitigate&#13;
against the worst possible outcome.&#13;
59.  A number of sensitivity tests were performed to analyze the impact of less than favorable events on&#13;
EAAB's financial soundness. These are described in Annex 10 and shown as Table 6 in that Annex. The&#13;
results show that even under a worst case scenario of all such events occurring at the same time, EAAB's&#13;
present financial position is sufficiently robust to ensure satisfactory completion of the Santafe I project.&#13;
However, under a number of scenarios of non-compliance with the Action Plan targets, EAAB's ability to&#13;
meet the stringent financial covenants becomes limited. As a result, it is also likely that the Bank would&#13;
not go ahead with a second phase financing as proposed. This possibility is also reflected in the relevant&#13;
sensitivity scenarios as discussed in Annex 11. Should EAAB find itself in any of the scenarios of&#13;
continued non-compliance and consequent erosion of its cashflows, both the District and the National&#13;
Governments can be expected to take swift corrective action under terms of the PP agreed betweeen&#13;
themselves and EAAB, and through the monitoring structure put in place by the Public Services Law.&#13;
7.     Other Financial Matters&#13;
60.  The level of accounts receivable at the end of December 31, 1993, was over 180 days. The Action&#13;
Plan requires that this be reduced to an acceptable 75-90 days by 1998. This corresponds to a ratio of&#13;
collection/billing of 92%. In the financial analysis, a slower rate of achievement is forecast in order to&#13;
ensure that EAAB's financial viability remains robust under less than optimal operating performance. The&#13;
Action Plan includes a specific target for the reduction of the billing/collection ratio.&#13;
61.  EAAB's accounting systems are being converted to computerized operations. However, EAAB has&#13;
experienced substantial delays in the process of the conversion due to software problems that are now being&#13;
resolved. A cost accounting system is also being implemented. However, the customer data base is not up&#13;
to date and results in substantial billing deficiencies. These are being addressed in the PP that is being&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
implemented now. During negotiations, agreement was reached that EAAB will submit semi-annual&#13;
reports on March 31 and September 30 of each year, detailing achievements against targets and indicators&#13;
set forth in the attachment to the Supplement Letter (see Section 3.01(b) of the Loan Agreement). In the&#13;
framework of the semi-annual reports, EAAB will report on progress in moving to computerized financial&#13;
accounting systems and management accounting and financial information systems and to employ&#13;
consultants on terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank in the implementation of modem financial and&#13;
management accounting systems and in setting up computerized billing systems.&#13;
8.     Accounts and Audit&#13;
62.  EAAB's accounting practices are satisfactory and follow generally acceptable accounting principles&#13;
applicable to a water and sewerage utility. The financial statements have been regularly audited by&#13;
independent extemal auditors. The audits have been satisfactory and generally without qualifications&#13;
recently, after a major effort in 1992-93 to remedy deficiencies, particularly with respect to correction of&#13;
errors in accounting treatment of fixed asset reevaluations. Audits cover Special Accounts established&#13;
under earlier projects. This practice would continue under the proposed project. During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was obtained on the provision by EAAB of independent audits, carried out in accordance with&#13;
generally accepted auditing standards within 120 days of the close of each financial year ending December&#13;
31, 1998 and thereafter, and not later than 180 days for the precedent financial years 8and on the inclusion&#13;
of an audit of the Special Account.&#13;
G.    Environmental Impact&#13;
63.  The project will generate both positive and negative impacts but the major environmental assessment&#13;
study of the project indicated the net benefit to be overwhelmingly positive. The assessment built on&#13;
studies of the previous two years, supported by the Bank (for the canceled BogotA V Project), and benefited&#13;
from extensive consultation between the consultants who carried out the assessment, EAAB, the World&#13;
Bank, the public and other interested organizations. The following text presents the positive and negative&#13;
impacts.&#13;
64.  The Bogota River Interceptor. With the construction of the first section of the Bogota River&#13;
interceptor, which forms part of the project, the wastewater of the northem part of the city will be&#13;
discharged to the BogotA River near the outfall of the Salitre tributary, thus greatly improving the quality of&#13;
the BogotA river in the 35 km long section between the Guaymaral Canal and the confluence with the&#13;
Salitre river. The main benefit of the pollution abatement in this river section is the improvement in the&#13;
quality of water used for irrigation of crops in the La Ramada agricultural district. Contaminated&#13;
vegetables from this area are currently considered to be a major cause of water-borne diseases in Bogota.&#13;
Water quality of the BogotA River downstream of the Salitre confluence will not change as a result of the&#13;
project works, since the sewage loads discharged to the river downstream will remain essentially the same.&#13;
65.  Bogota River Tributaries and Canals. The water quality in sections of the tributaries of the&#13;
BogotA River within the city limits (the Rivers Salitre, Fucha and Tunjuelo as well as other smaller&#13;
streams) will significantly improve as a result of construction of the sewage interceptors of the Santafe I&#13;
program and better separation of sewage and stormwater. This will result in decrease of public health risks&#13;
8 EAAB proposed, and the Bank accepted, that due to the difficulties inherent in the changes of accounting systems and&#13;
incorporation of new computerized systems, an additonal 60 days be provided to ensure compliance with the Bank's auditing&#13;
requirements at least through the first three years of project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
for the population residing along these water-courses. Many of the city's storm water drainage canals will&#13;
also benefit in the same manner.&#13;
66.  Reduced Flooding. Construction of the canals and pipes of the drainage component of the project&#13;
will also reduce the risk of flooding in some low-lying parts of the city (Torca, Salitre, Fucha and Tintal)&#13;
which, currently are periodically exposed to flooding by contaminated river water. The drainage&#13;
rehabilitation and construction under the project will, therefore, improve quality of life both by mitigating&#13;
floods, as well as by reducing danger to public health arising from direct contact of the population with&#13;
contaminated flood water.&#13;
67.  Protection of Wetlands. The quality of water in the wetlands located within the limits of the Capital&#13;
District will significantly improve as a result of the project works, since the Santafe I program includes&#13;
diversion of all raw wastewater that currently flow into these wetlands. This will be most notably the case&#13;
with the Los Cementerios, Juan Amarillo, Jaboque, El Burro and La Vaca wetlands. The improvement of&#13;
the wetlands' water quality will result in a better environment for the native fauna and flora in these&#13;
wetlands and will reduce public health risks originating from the pathogenic contamination associated with&#13;
the current discharge of raw wastewater. In addition, construction plans will require tree planting and&#13;
revegetation of many existing waterways and wetlands with resulting aesthetic and ecological benefits.&#13;
Furthermore, an adequate annual amount of funds will be allocated for financing a wetlands protection&#13;
program over the seven years of project implementation. In order to ensure the best use of these funds, a&#13;
study will be financed by the project to develop wetland protection and management plans for each of the&#13;
wetlands within the Capital District limits. Additional information regarding wetlands protection is&#13;
presented in Annex 4.&#13;
68.   The environmental assessment study indicated major negative impact in four areas: disposal of&#13;
dredgates and other excavation materials, local and temporary impacts associated with construction&#13;
activities, negative impacts on wetland viability and involuntary resettlement. Mitigation measures for all&#13;
significant negative impacts will be implemented under the project, in accordance with an Environmental&#13;
Management Plan proposed in the environmental assessment study. Some residual negative impacts will&#13;
however remain (for example, the inconvenience resulting from passage of about half a million dump truck&#13;
loads). A newly created Environmental Committee within EAAB will be responsible for implementation of&#13;
the Environmental Management Plan.&#13;
69.  Construction of the project will entail the displacement of 65 low-income fanmilies (311 persons).&#13;
EAAB anticipates no major problem managing the negotiated compensation for displacement of these&#13;
families, an event of common occurrence in the construction of similar works and one with which EAAB is&#13;
familiar. EAAB has presented a comprehensive plan, acceptable to the Bank and under Colombian law,&#13;
for the resettlement of these families. The Castilla and part of the Cundinamarca sewage interceptors and&#13;
drainage canals, located in the Tintal area, have been excluded from the project, pending further analysis,&#13;
since they require complementary works to be carried out by private developers and for which an&#13;
acceptable resettlement program has not yet been developed. EAAB has indicated its intention to ensure&#13;
that a detailed resettlement program, acceptable to the Bank, will be implemented also in the areas to be&#13;
developed by the private sector. Once such a program is presented to the Bank and found satisfactory, the&#13;
construction of the Castilla and Cundinanarca interceptors and drainage canals may be considered under&#13;
the project, utilizing unallocated funds to finance them, without increasing the overall project cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
H.    Socioeconomic Impact&#13;
70.  During the construction period, the project will provide a significant amount of local employment.&#13;
The project will result in an annual increase of about 26,000 water house connections and about 28,000&#13;
sewerage connections in the Capital District, most of them in poor neighborhoods. The improvements in&#13;
the water supply service included in the project, such as creating uniform water pressure, increasing the&#13;
storage capacity, and strengthening parts of the distribution system, will diminish de facto discrimination in&#13;
service quality and benefit mostly the urban poor, whose water supply service level is generally lower. The&#13;
improvement and extension of water supply and sewerage services will increase land values and will&#13;
contribute to a more orderly process of urban development.&#13;
1.     Project Risks and Safeguards&#13;
71.  The main risks of the project are associated with the institutional reforms that are being&#13;
implemented. As discussed in the earlier chapters, these risks principally encompass back-sliding on the&#13;
reforms pertaining to autonomy of EAAB and its managerial and financial independence from political&#13;
interference. The principal safeguard against these risks has been in the sensitization of the public over the&#13;
last two years to the major issues, the demand for more effective, efficient and responsive services, and the&#13;
provisions agreed and reflected in the Development Plan for disclosure of key information to all clients&#13;
every two months, along with user representation on the restructured Board of EAAB. These risks are&#13;
also mitigated by ensuring that more of the operations will be let out to private sector participation in the&#13;
form of long-term concessions and service contracts that will provide a measure of reliability and insulation&#13;
from political interference. Adequate financial safeguards are being proposed under the project covenants&#13;
that would reduce the financial risks and ensure commitment by the government at the national and capital&#13;
district levels to sound financial structure for EAAB and for delivery of the basic water and sewerage&#13;
services to the city. The proposed mid-term review of project performance would also allow the&#13;
government and the Bank to adjust the targets set under the Action Plan. The monitoring indicators would&#13;
provide sufficient feedback on performance in a timely manner to effect needed mid-course corrections if&#13;
that becomes necessary. Nonetheless, it must be recognized that the provision of water and sanitary&#13;
sewerage for a city the size of Bogota is part of a political process that cannot be ignored by the institutions&#13;
carrying out the task. The safeguards that are being implemented to ensure that EAAB remains relatively&#13;
free of day-to-day interference and that EAAB is able to maintain a level of integrity in its basic operations&#13;
and commercial processes are the best insurance against risk of failure and a return to institutional&#13;
disorder that preceded the reform program now underway.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A.    Status of Project Preparation&#13;
72.  The technical preparation of the project has been underway since early 1993 and project preparation&#13;
is well advanced. Detailed engineering designs and technical specifications are available for about 45 % of&#13;
the works. These include 80% of the primary sewerage and drainage systems, 50% of the primary water&#13;
distribution networks, 100% of the rehabilitation works and 20% of the secondary water and sewerage&#13;
networks. Designs for the rest of the works are under preparation and will be completed according to the&#13;
project implementation schedule.&#13;
B.    Organizational Aspects&#13;
73.  EAAB will be the Borrower and sole beneficiary of the Bank loans. EAAB will coordinate with&#13;
DAMA in the implementation of the environmental component relating to the protection of wetlands.&#13;
EAAB has recently undergone a major organizational restructuring (Annex 5) to be able to carry out&#13;
project implementation in an appropriate strategic context. Since the project objectives and activities will&#13;
represent practically all of EAAB's functional areas of activity, effective project implementation and&#13;
oversight will be primarily dependent on effective management practices at all levels. The General&#13;
Manager of EAAB will have a crucial role in this regard. Moreover, in order to enhance institutional and&#13;
strategic sustainability, EAAB is now taking steps to enter into contractual arrangements by November&#13;
1995, with a modem and efficient water utility in an industrialized country, for support with advice,&#13;
transfer of executive know-how and trouble shooting over the long-term.&#13;
74.  The essence of the renewed emphasis on effective implementation will be in the close coordination&#13;
between all functional areas (Vice Presidencies and departments) of EAAB, with ownership by all of them&#13;
for a project and a corporate vision in whose formulation they have actively participated. A senior&#13;
manager of EAAB's staff, highly experienced in management of large scale projects, will be nominated as&#13;
the Santafe I project Coordinator, reporting directly to the General Manager. He will be assisted by a&#13;
project coordination unit staffed by extemal consultants who have already been hired. This unit is&#13;
composed of a group of experts who will provide independent monitoring of each activity of the project&#13;
components and oversight of project implementation. The project coordination unit will also develop,&#13;
maintain and support management information systems which will facilitate compliance of the Santafe I&#13;
program objectives. Responsibilities for overall project coordination and for implementation of the distinct&#13;
components of the project according to the new organizational structure of EAAB are described in and&#13;
presented diagrammatically in Annex 12. The implementation schedule of each of the main project&#13;
components is presented in Annex 13.&#13;
75.  The program of UFW reduction will be managed by a special coordinator directly to the General&#13;
Manager. This position has been established not only to implement the proposed actions to reduce UFW,&#13;
but as a permanent feature of EAAB's organization to ensure that UFW reduction goals are reached and&#13;
remain under control. The coordinator will coordinate the activities of the Operations, Commercial,&#13;
Technical and Planning Vice Presidencies that will be involved in implementing the UFW reduction&#13;
program, and will have responsibilities for the day to day control and coordination of all actions required to&#13;
accomplish UFW reduction goals and to develop monitoring indicators to assess progress made by the&#13;
different divisions in charge of distinct components of this program. The goal set in the Development Plan&#13;
is to reduce UFW from the current level of about 40% to below 20% by the year 2000. During negotiations&#13;
agreement was obtained that EAAB will maintain a specialized unit to implement all needed actions to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
reduce UFW to the target levels and will staff the unit with suitably qualified and experienced personnel at&#13;
all times.&#13;
76.  To implement the environmental components of the project, EAAB will establish an Environmental&#13;
Committee by January 1, 1996. This Committee will have the important task of overseeing the&#13;
implementation of the Environmental component of the Santafe I project. In the longer term, this unit is&#13;
expected to considerably improve the capacity of EAAB to analyze and incorporate environmental concerns&#13;
into all aspects of its work. During negotiations, EAAB submitted plans for the creation of this Committee,&#13;
TORs and contracts for the external environmental consultant required for its effective performance as well&#13;
as a detailed work plan. The detailed implementation of environmental strengthening through this&#13;
mechanism could be modified or improved in the future, through mutual agreement between the EAAB and&#13;
the Bank, if the institutional goals could be reached more efficiently by any other mechanism. Additional&#13;
information regarding the environmental institutional strengthening of EAAB is presented in Annex 3.&#13;
77.  The institutional adjustment study, which would determine the institutional adjustment process of&#13;
EAAB, and its following implementation actions will be managed by a steering committee integrated by the&#13;
Capital District, EAAB's General Manager and some high level officials. A technical group will support&#13;
study supervision and will be strengthened to help carry out all implementation issues. The initial goal is to&#13;
begin the study by February 1996, and have a decision on the approved alternative before June 1996.&#13;
Detailed designs and implementation would then proceed in the subsequent two years. In the framework of&#13;
the project EAAB will formulate s strategy for development of a management information system and&#13;
redesign the financial information system. The related computer hardware and software systems for data&#13;
processing would be purchase at the opportune time in a fashion consistent with the formulated strategy.&#13;
78.  A set of operational, monitoring, impact, financial and project execution targets and indicators has&#13;
been established to monitor performance of the project and performance of the Borrower (Annex 14).&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was obtained that EAAB will take all actions necessary to meet such&#13;
performance indicators, all to be calculated in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. EAAB, with the help of&#13;
an independent consulting firm, which has already been hired to monitor the PP, will report on EAAB&#13;
compliance with these indicators by September 30 of every year as well as prepare projections for the&#13;
following three years. These projections will be submitted to the Bank for review. The Government has set&#13;
up a project oversight committee with representatives of the Ministries of Finance and Development, DNP,&#13;
FINDETER and EAAB, which will evaluate the reports on progress and compliance with the physical and&#13;
institutional objectives of the Santafe I project. These reports will be prepared by the independent firm&#13;
hired to monitor the PP. In order to ensure that EAAB continues to meet its institutional, financial and&#13;
operating performance targets, Bank financing of the second phase of implementation will be subject to a&#13;
satisfactory review to be carried out after September 30, 1997, when EAAB will submit a comprehesive&#13;
mid-term report. The timing of reporting by EAAB on project implementation progress and on compliance&#13;
with the Action Plan has been set out in a Supplemental Letter to the Loan Agreements. Quarterly reports&#13;
of project progress and semi-annual reports of compliance with the Action Plan will be submitted by&#13;
EAAB. The annual report of compliance prepared by the independent firm mentioned above will&#13;
supplement EAAB reports.&#13;
79.  EAAB needs to acquire some 350 ha of land to accommodate the construction of the main canals and&#13;
interceptors, water mains, water storage tanks, peak-flow attenuation lagoons and pumping stations. Most&#13;
of this land has already been legalized, i.e., landowners are not allowed to build in these areas and EAAB&#13;
has up to six years to reach a compensated settlement with the owners. A small part of the land has already&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
been purchased by EAAB. In addition, EAAB will present to the Bank, before inviting bids for&#13;
construction of any of the applicable interceptors and canals, satisfactory evidence that:&#13;
*      a satisfactory resettlement of the current occupants of the land has been agreed with them;&#13;
*      environmental mitigatory measures, recommended in the detailed enginenering studies have&#13;
been incorporated in the construction plans.&#13;
80.  All this evidence would be submitted to the Bank as a condition of inviting bids for construction for&#13;
each of these works.&#13;
C.    Procurement&#13;
81.  Procurement of goods and services under the proposed project will be in accordance with the Bank&#13;
Guidelines for Procurement of Goods and Works (January 1995) and Bank Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants (August 1981). EAAB has agreed that the Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) issued by the&#13;
Bank will be used for procurement of goods and works for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and the&#13;
sample form of contract for consultants services will be used for consultants' contracts. Standard bidding&#13;
documents, satisfactory to the Bank, will be prepared by EAAB and used in procurement of goods and&#13;
works under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures. EAAB has agreed that for large consulting&#13;
contracts, estimated to cost in excess of US$ 500,000 equivalent, as well as for all consultant contracts for&#13;
institutional and financial/economic studies, the selection of consultants will be made on the basis of&#13;
technical quality only and the price negotiated with the highest scoring firm. A formula combining quality&#13;
and price, the latter with no more than 30% weight, may be used for all other consulting contracts.&#13;
Provisions of paragraphs 2.5.4 and 2.5.5 of the Guidelines and Appendix 2 thereto should apply to goods&#13;
manufactured in Colombia&#13;
82.  A breakdown of civil works, goods and services for the project to be procured by ICB, NCB, and&#13;
other methods is presented in Table 6.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
83.  Contracts for civil works estimated to cost more than US$ 4.0 million, and goods purchases of more&#13;
than US$ 250,000 would be awarded through ICB. Contracts for civil works estimated to cost US$ 4.0&#13;
million or less, and goods purchases estimated to cost between more than US$ 50,000 and more than US$&#13;
250,000 would be awarded on the basis of NCB procedures, subject to an aggregate amount of US$ 90&#13;
million for works and goods (for the two loans). Prequalification of bidders would be required for all civil&#13;
works contracts estimated to cost US$ 10.0 million equivalent or more. Contracts for US$ 50,000 or less&#13;
for goods would be awarded on the basis of intemational or national shopping procedures as detemiined by&#13;
the Bank in consultation with the Borrower, subject to an aggregate limit of US$ 15 million (for the two&#13;
loans. The threshold established for ICB would ensure that contracts procured under International&#13;
Competitive Bidding would account for about 43% of the estimated project cost. The limits of contract&#13;
values by type of procurement are shown in Annex 15.&#13;
84.  The Bank's prior review of procurement documentation will cover all major procurement steps&#13;
(bidding documents, evaluation report, award recommendation and contract) and would apply to:&#13;
*      all contracts procured under ICB;&#13;
*      the first two contracts procured under NCB each year; and&#13;
*      all consulting services contracts provided by firms and estimated to cost US$ 100,000&#13;
equivalent or more, and all consulting services contracts provided by individual consultants&#13;
and estimated to cost US$ 50,000 or more. 9&#13;
85.  It has been agreed with EAAB that, wherever feasible, works and goods will be combined into larger&#13;
bidding packages to simplify Bank review procedures and accelerate execution. The tentative procurement&#13;
schedule for all project works has been reviewed during appraisal, and discussed in detail for the first year&#13;
of the Project's implementation. A list of the bidding packages of the main works, agreed upon during&#13;
appraisal, is presented in Annex 16. The total amount of all contracts subject to prior review is estimated&#13;
to be about US$ 360 million, or about 62% of the amount of contracts under the proposed Bank financing.&#13;
In light of the Bank's extensive prior experience with EAAB's procurement capacity, this is acceptable.&#13;
D.     Disbursement&#13;
86.  The proceeds of the proposed loans are expected to be disbursed in accordance with the allocation of&#13;
categories shown in Annex 17, over a period of 7 years, which is the average for the country profile for&#13;
Colombia and the water sector profile for Latin America. The disbursement period was determined after&#13;
taking into account the status of project designs, EAAB's execution capacity and cash generation capacity.&#13;
The proposed loans will be disbursed against:&#13;
*      Expenditures for civil works: 40 % of eligible local and foreign costs;&#13;
*      Expenditures for equipment and materials: 40% of eligible local and foreign costs; and,&#13;
9 It is estimated that the aggregate amount of contracts subject to prior review will total US$ 55 million for services to be&#13;
provided by firms and US$ 3 million for services to be provided by individuals. Of the remaining estimated US$ 20.6 million&#13;
of consultant services and training contracts, US$ 18 milion are expected to be awarded to firms, and the remainder to&#13;
individuals, and would be below the above prior review limits. Thus, in the aggregate, 74% of consultant contracts would be&#13;
subject to prior review. Terms of reference for all contracts below the prior review limit would be approved by the Bank prior&#13;
to the selection of consultants by EAAB.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Expenditures for consulting services, technical assistance, training and supervision of&#13;
works: 52% of eligible local and foreign costs&#13;
87.  For civil works contracts valued at less than US$ 4,000,000 equivalent, goods valued at less than&#13;
US$ 250,000 equivalent, consultant services contracts valued at less US$ 100,000 equivalent for firms and&#13;
less than US$ 50,000 for individuals, disbursements would be made against statement of expenditures&#13;
(SOEs). Non-contract expenditures such as training would also be made against SOEs. Documentation for&#13;
these expenditures would not be submitted to the Bank, but would be retained by EAAB for periodic&#13;
inspection by the Bank staff and for audit. All other disbursements would be made against full&#13;
documentation. To expedite disbursements, two Special Accounts (one for each loan) would be opened in a&#13;
commercial bank at EAAB's discretion, with initial deposits of US$ 2.0 and US$ 3.0 million, until&#13;
disbursements from the loans account have reached the equivalent of US$ 20.0 and US$ 30.0 million, at&#13;
which point, the deposit in the Special Accounts would be raised to the equivalent of US$ 4.0 and US$ 6.0&#13;
million to cover four months of expected average disbursements thereafter. The Closing Date will be June&#13;
30, 2003 , i.e., six months after the estimated completion of the project (December 31, 2002). The forecast&#13;
loans disbursement schedule (on a consolidated basis for the two loans) is shown in Annex 17.&#13;
E.    Monitoring and Impact Indicators&#13;
88.  The Project's main objectives and achievements will be followed up by a set of monitoring and&#13;
impact indicators. Monitoring indicators include: a) milestones for action plans agreed for: installation of&#13;
commercial, financial and management information systems, tariff restructuring and institutional&#13;
improvements (including strategy development and implementation of the adjustment process); b) annual&#13;
physical performance targets proposed for Santafe I, including lengths of water and sewerage pipe installed&#13;
and rehabilitated, number of water meters connected, and UFW reduction activities performed; and c)&#13;
operational, financial and commercial indicators. During negotiations agreement was obtained that EAAB&#13;
will take all measures needed to ensure its compliance with the monitoring indicators which have been&#13;
incorporated as an Action Plan in a Supplemental Letter to the Loan Agreements.&#13;
89.  The proposed Impact Indicators will help evaluate the project's impact regarding five key objectives:&#13;
a) Poverty alleviation, through water and sewerage connections in poor neighborhoods; b) Drainage and&#13;
flood control, through tracking additional areas with access to drainage; c) Environmental protection,&#13;
through area of wetlands preserved; d) vulnerability reduction through the completion of key identified&#13;
works and; e) efficiency and effectiveness, related to UFW reduction, control of personnel costs and of&#13;
pipe-bursts which interrupt service. Through this exercise, actual results will be analyzed in terms of the&#13;
real impact achieved, in comparison with the status (baseline) in these areas estimated at appraisal.&#13;
90.  The details regarding the agreed monitoring and impact indicators are presented in Annex 14. Data&#13;
for both types of these indicators will be presented in the annual reports. Monitoring indicators will be&#13;
compared with the estimates at appraisal, as recorded in the minutes of the negotiations. Impact indicators&#13;
will be assessed in terms of progress in reaching the agreed objectives. Both will be discussed in detail&#13;
during supervision and all substantial differences, if found, will be analyzed, and followed-up by&#13;
formulated corrective action. EAAB is upgrading its information systems to allow adequate recording,&#13;
reporting, and implementation of corrective actions resulting from the analysis of recorded data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
F.     Supervision&#13;
91.  For the implementation of the project, EAAB has designed an organizational structure, fully&#13;
integrated within its reformed structure, based on a project Coordinator, assisted by an external project&#13;
coordination unit, which would coordinate and monitor all project activities carried out by the various&#13;
departments and Vice Presidencies of EAAB. This project focuses on strengthening EAAB's&#13;
implementation capacity, in order to reach the planned level of investments and to enter into a new, more&#13;
efficient pattern, through adequate attention to strategic issues of better customer service, poverty&#13;
alleviation, and environmental protection.&#13;
92.  An analysis of EAAB's capacity, in terms of procedures, organization and resources, to achieve its&#13;
corporate as well as the project's objectives on a timely basis has been carried out. This has included an&#13;
examination of procedures and time-frame for contract award and execution and the contracting plan under&#13;
the project. The close follow-up of monitoring and impact indicators, financial and project reports will take&#13;
place in the framework of monitoring of EAAB's corporate strategy and achievements under the&#13;
performance plan.&#13;
93. The Bank's supervision will include a combination of: a) supervision by HQ staff including support&#13;
from specialized consultants as required (for institutional adjustment and private sector incorporation as&#13;
well as for addressing environmental issues); and b) continuous follow-up by a long-term, higher-level&#13;
consultant based in the Colombia Resident Mission. This supervision will be based on the Borrower's&#13;
demonstrated ownership and internal monitoring, with a restructured and more effective organization.&#13;
Supervision resources are estimated at an annual average of 16 staff-weeks, including HQ staff and&#13;
consultants' contribution. This estimate includes 4 staff-weeks for a Colombian consultant during&#13;
missions. The Colombia resident mission will provide about 8 staff-weeks annually for an overall follow-up&#13;
of Santafe I and EAAB's performance with general support and advice on implementation issues to EAAB,&#13;
review of the institutional performance of EAAB, and inputs and support to the task manager and other&#13;
supervision specialists. The time and level of delegated responsibility given to the Resident Mission will&#13;
gradually increase during project implementation.&#13;
94.  The first three years of execution of the project will be intensively supervised since the&#13;
implementation schedule shows that about 40% of investments will be carried out during these years. The&#13;
calendar years 1996, 1997 includes many important activities in all the components of Santafe I and&#13;
emphasis will be placed on supervision during these years. During the mid-term review of the project, an&#13;
assessment of the supervision plan and strategy will be carried out, and corrective actions, as needed, will&#13;
be designed and introduced for the rest of the implementation period.&#13;

ANNEX I&#13;
Colombia&#13;
Santafe I Water Supply And Sewerage Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Annex 1 Population Growth, Water Demand and Supply Balance in Bogota Metropolitan Area&#13;
A.    Population Growth:&#13;
1.    Bogota's population was growing at a phenomenal rate (close to 7% p.a.) in the fifties and sixties&#13;
when it almost doubled every ten years. Since then population growth has abated to about 2.6% p.a. during&#13;
the eighties. It is apparently continuing to grow at that level or somewhat lower in the current decade, and&#13;
is expected to decline to about 1.7% by the turn of the century. The population in the surrounding&#13;
municipalities served, or to be served, by EAAB, is characterized mostly by low and middle income&#13;
groups. Population in these urban centers, however, is expected to triple over the next twenty years as the&#13;
number of municipalities to be served is also expected to increase.&#13;
2.    Contrary to earlier forecasts of expected population levels, the XVI National Population Census of&#13;
1993 estimated that the population in the Capital District alone (including the rural areas) reached 6.3&#13;
million. Together with the populations of the surrounding municipalities of Soacha, Sopo, La Calera,&#13;
Cajica, Chia, Tocancipa and Gachancipa, the total population in EAAB's service area rises to over 6.4&#13;
million. This new estimate of the population of the Metropolitan area is over 12% higher than previous&#13;
estimates, which had placed the population level at around 5.7 million, and which had been the basis for&#13;
EAAB's planning of water and sewerage infrastructure to be implemented over the next decade.&#13;
3.    EAAB's population projections adjusted for the results of the 1993 census data are shown in Table&#13;
1. At the present rate of growth, the population in the area serviced by EAAB would reach 8.3 million by&#13;
2000, and reach 10 million in 2010. The implications of this growth are two-fold: first, there are likely&#13;
greater numbers of low income residents in the newly urbanizing districts than had been previously&#13;
suspected, attributable primarily to continued high levels of in-migration that probably exceeds 13% p.a.;&#13;
the number of illegal connections are also estimated now at over 200,000; at the same time, with the&#13;
relatively greater certainty in the amount of water produced and billed, there is now reason to believe that,&#13;
given the existing evidence of larger household sizes at the lower income strata, the present levels of water&#13;
use in Bogota imply a lower per capita consumption than had been calculated using previous population&#13;
data.&#13;

B.    Water Consumption:&#13;
4.    Average domestic water consumption, on a water connection and per capita basis, has steadily&#13;
declined for the past fifteen years. Two main variables help to explain most of this decline. First, from&#13;
1975 to the present more low income population gained access to these services as water service coverage&#13;
increased from less than 75% to 88% in Bogota. At the same time the number of persons per house&#13;
connection decreased from 7.5 in the early seventies to about 6.5 at present. Both trends decrease average&#13;
consumption on a connection basis, while the first also affects average consumption on a per capita basis.&#13;
Second, services rates have steadily increased in real terms (about 30 % during the eighties). A regression&#13;
of price and number of connections (number of connections and persons per connection) versus residential&#13;
consumption indicates elasticities of -0.28 and -0.27 respectively. This regression shows a high correlation&#13;
(r2 = 0.98) and therefore helps to explain rather well the decline in average domestic consumption on a&#13;
connection basis. Estimates on a per capita basis are somewhat less reliable as data on the number of&#13;
persons per connection are only available for census years (the last in 1993), and EAAB has not yet fully&#13;
analyzed the numbers from the latest census. Nevertheless, as EAAB provides water services to nearby&#13;
municipalities, mostly on a bulk basis, demand has been calculated for projection purposes, on a per capita&#13;
basis, as the number of connections in these areas is not well known or controlled by EAAB.&#13;
5.    Per capita water consumption is derived from the recorded flows in the system and the estimated&#13;
population figures, as well as the level of transmission line losses. EAAB estimated the per capita&#13;
consumption (both residential and non-residential) in 1973 at 205 liters/day; in 1990, this figure had&#13;
declined to 170 liters/day. It is estimated that the per capita residential consumption would remain at a&#13;
level of 128 liters/day, while the overal consumption would be around 177 lieters/day in 2000. For the&#13;
metropolitan area as a whole, the consumption figures tend to be lower reflecting the insufficiency of data&#13;
at the household level for the surrounding municipalities. In terms of water demand however, the level of&#13;
system losses needs to be factored in order to determine the real level of production required to satisfy the&#13;
consumption.&#13;

6.    Total water consumption statistics for Bogota show a steady rising trend over the past decade.&#13;
Based on water flow recorded at the outputs of the water treatment plants, EAAB statistics show an&#13;
increase from a flow of 12.67m3/sec in 1985 to an estimated 17.66 m3/sec during 1994, implying a&#13;
growth of 0.5 m3/sec annually. The demand growth varies between 0.4 m3/ sec to 0.65 m3/sec per year.&#13;
At the present average annual rates of growth, water demand in the metropolitan area would reach 25&#13;
m3/sec by the year 2014. As discussed in the section below, EAAB's maximum deliverable supply is at&#13;
25 m3/sec, provided the Tibito plant is fully rehabilitated, and the vulnerability of the Usaquen tunnel and&#13;
the Tibito pipelines are also substantially reduced or even eliminated.&#13;

7.       The expected increase in rate levels will be offset to some extent by the increase in living&#13;
standards. On the other hand, water consumption in the surrounding municipalities reports on a per capita&#13;
basis is about 70% that of BogotA. Population served in these municipalities account for 10 % of the total&#13;
in 1990 and 17% by the turn of the century. Information of industrial water consumption per unit of&#13;
production output is not available. Therefore, for projection purposes the overall consumption trend, on a&#13;
per capita basis, has been adopted.&#13;
C.    Demand Projections&#13;
8.       Water consumption and production projections over the next 20 years are presented, based on&#13;
the above mentioned assumptions and plan to reduce UFW (see below):&#13;

D.    Unaccounted For Water&#13;
9.    Unaccounted for water was on the rise for many years. As part of the BogotA IV Project, EAAB&#13;
undertook with the help of consultants a detailed analysis of this problem. The main causes of UFW were:&#13;
i) illegal uses; ii) errors of micro-metering at the retail end; iii) physical leaks in the system; and iv) errors&#13;
of bulk metering at the treatment plants. The level of total UFW was estimated at over 40% in 1990 and&#13;
had only declined marginally to under 40% in 1993. Taking into account the level of UFW, the apparent&#13;
levels of water consumption lead to substantially higher levels of demand at the output of the treatment&#13;
plants. Commercial factors, namely, illegal connections, unmetered connections and faulty meters&#13;
accounted for over 55% of the UFW in 1993, technical factors, mainly, leaks in the distribution system&#13;
and in the house connections accounted for another 23%, while, problems of macrometering accounted for&#13;
the remaining 22%.&#13;
10.   EAAB initiated, in mid 199 1, an ambitious program to reduce UFW. As part of this initiative,&#13;
overall responsibility and coordination of all actions to reduce UFW has been assigned to a special unit&#13;
reporting to the general manager. The program started by the identification of illegal connections and by&#13;
February of 1992 some 80,000 illegal connections had been located and are now officially registered in the&#13;
commercial system. The proposed project will provide funds to improve meter maintenance, better pressure&#13;
sectoring in the distribution system, replacement of old pipes and detection and correction of illegal&#13;
connections. Based on this detailed program, UFW is expected to decline to about 30% by the turn of the&#13;
century.&#13;
11.   The effect of the reduction of commercial and physical losses is substantial. A parallel reduction&#13;
of commercial and physical losses is assumed, as the UFW reduction program is directed at reducing both.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38-&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
The reduction of commercial loses will help the finances of EAAB as more water will be billed. The&#13;
reduction of leaks will save on production costs (chemicals and pumping). Both will have an effect on&#13;
water conservation and therefore total production will decrease in relative terms. However, given the latest&#13;
estimates of total demand in the Bogota metropolitan area, it is unlikely that the need for additional&#13;
capacity can be postponed much beyond the early part of the next century. Nevertheless, with the UFW&#13;
program in place, expected savings in additional production areas is substantial as shown in Table 5 below:&#13;

E.    Supply Constraints&#13;
12.   EAAB has three major sources of water supply; first is the Chingaza system which provides a&#13;
reliable system capacity flow of 14 m3/sec, based on previous hydrologic records and the estimated&#13;
reliability of the system parameters; second is the Tibito system fed from the upper reaches of the Rio&#13;
Bogota, which can provide a maximum flow of I Om3/sec; third is the much smaller Tunjuelo system that&#13;
accounts for about I m3/sec of available flow. At present, the Tibito system is in need of major&#13;
rehabilitation and is only providing about 60% of its capacity flow (see Annex 2). As the production costs&#13;
are also higher at the Tibito plant, due to the need for extensive pumping and substantially higher costs of&#13;
treatment, EAAB is mainly relying upon the Chingaza system to satisfy about 60% of the total current&#13;
water demand. This adds to the vulnerability of the main transmission tunnel from the Chingaza supply.&#13;
13.   EAAB estimates that with these three sources of supply, subject to satisfactory completion of the&#13;
proposed rehabilitation and vulnerability control investments in the Tibito and Chingaza systems, a&#13;
maximum flow of 25 m3/ sec would be available. EAAB's consultants have now estimated that based on&#13;
the possible growth of demand, this supply level will need to be augmented as early as 2003, and no later&#13;
than 2014. The earlier scenario is reached if demand grows faster than has so far been taken into EAAB's&#13;
planning estimates. The main reasons for assuming a higher rate of growth of demand are two fold: first, it&#13;
is likely that EAAB's efforts at reducing UFW levels will be only moderately successful, given the&#13;
continued migration into the Bogota metropolitan area and to the urban perimeter; second, as more house&#13;
connections are made, it is also likely that water consumption per connection will grow modestly even as&#13;
per capita consumption declines marginally over the next several years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39-&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
14.    EAAB's consultants now estimate that given the uncertainties surrounding the real demand for&#13;
water in the Bogota metropolitan area, and the paucity of detailed studies, EAAB must plan for the&#13;
potential maximum growth of demand and start the process of investing in new water sources as early as&#13;
1997. Further studies are needed to examine the detailed cost of the proposed alternatives and to choose the&#13;
optimal investment path.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
Colombia&#13;
Santafe I Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Annex 2 Water Supply, Sanitation and Pollution in the Bogota Metropolitan Area&#13;
1.     General. The Capital District and surrounding municipalities account for a population estimated at&#13;
around 6.4 million in 1993, which is projected to reach 9.5 million by the year 2010. Of the present population,&#13;
over I million represent the urban poor, many of whom live in unsanitary conditions on the banks of the highly&#13;
polluted Bogota River, or in zones of illegal development with relatively poor access to water and sanitation&#13;
services. The Capital District is not only the most populous urban concentration in the country, but also the&#13;
most industrialized, with about 30% of the nation's industries located in the Bogota River watershed, and most of&#13;
the commercial activity of Colombia taking place in this river basin.&#13;
2.     Water Supply. The Bogota Water Supply and Sewerage Company (EAAB) is responsible for water&#13;
supply, sewerage and storm drainage services in the Capital area; it also provides bulk and retail water supply&#13;
services to surrounding municipalities, of which the most important and rapidly growing is Soacha. Given the&#13;
relative institutional weakness of these municipalities and the large economies of scale in water production, it is&#13;
likely that EAAB's influence in the Savanna of Bogota will grow over time. Service coverage in the Capital area&#13;
is high by national standards. The total population to be served by house connections in the metropolitan area is&#13;
expected to grow from about 91 % in 1990 to about 94% by the year 2010, assuming a stable and enabling&#13;
institutional environment, the adoption and implementation of a coherent strategy supported by all the major&#13;
stakeholders, and the strengthening of EAAB's financial solidity. Meanwhile, the major concern of the Capital&#13;
District authorities, EAAB's current Administration, and the national Government is to reduce the vulnerability&#13;
of the system, which will only partially be relieved by the completion of the San Rafael system for reserve&#13;
capacity in late 1995. The most urgent priority in water supply in the Capital area is therefore to carry out&#13;
rehabilitation and long-neglected maintenance works to enable the two main systems (Chingaza and Tibitoc) to&#13;
operate at full capacity, and to adopt a least-cost approach of optimization of use of installed production capacity&#13;
through improvements in the production, water treatment, and transmission/distribution portions of the existing&#13;
systems. Such an approach should help meet water supply needs until the year 2014 and relieve fears of&#13;
rationing and public discontent caused by service interruptions and lack of distribution network in the "barrios&#13;
subnormales". Intractable corrosion problems in the Tibitoc system and frequent break-downs of tunnels in the&#13;
Chingaza system have led to existing plant being used only at two-thirds of capacity, and water supply being shut&#13;
off in parts of the city for days together. Despite some emergency maintenance in the last year, there is&#13;
considerable scope for a more systematic approach. In any case, the installation of new production capacity,&#13;
along with the related water treatment and distribution network, other than the optimization type approach&#13;
mentioned, would not only be much more expensive, but would probably require at least 12 years for the&#13;
investments to come on stream. The population of the metropolitan area is expected to continue growing and is&#13;
expected to reach 13 million inhabitants by the year 2025. Consequently, the urgent need to start studies,&#13;
planning, and design process for this later investment has been recognized. The first stage in that direction has&#13;
been taken by DNP and EAAB through hiring of the Colombian consulting firm INGETEC which is preparing a&#13;
pre-feasibility study for development of the future water sources of Bogoti. (see Annex 1)&#13;
3.     All water supplied is treated and chlorinated to meet or exceed WHO water quality guidelines. All&#13;
water connections and production sources are metered. Unaccounted for water (UFW) increased steadily from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
22% in the early 70's to an estimated 42% by 1990. The main cause, accounting for about 65% of the UFW, lay&#13;
in problems in the commercial system, of illegal connections and faulty meters, as well as internal corruption.&#13;
The other 35% of UFW was caused by leaks in the distribution system and house connections, and problems in&#13;
macrometering. Under the Bank-financed Bogota IV project, the issues were studied and a comprehensive plan&#13;
developed to reduce UFW gradually. Initiation of implementation was, however, delayed, and even with a&#13;
renewed emphasis under a more vigorous management, only limited progress has been achieved in the last year&#13;
in reducing UFW (regarding macrometering in particular). UFW is currently estimated at around 39.7%. Initial&#13;
efforts have been directed to improve the commercial system and the security to access its software, as well as to&#13;
identify areas of the city where massive illegal connections are a problem and leaky pipes need to be replaced.&#13;
Also, the commercial department has been restructured and restaffed, with the dismissal of about 150 staff of&#13;
EAAB in March, 1993, assistance on a continuing basis from a special in-house team from the Office of the&#13;
Procurator-General to weed out corruption and carry out arrests has been established, and an approach to sub-&#13;
contract auditing of the commercial department's activities to an independent agency is being carried out. EAAB&#13;
has sharpened accountability for the UFW reduction program by the creation of a unit, reporting directly to the&#13;
General Manager, with the mandate to coordinate the actions of different administrative units of EAAB assigns&#13;
to specific tasks to make this reduction program a reality and maintain the gains accrued over time. Agreements&#13;
will be reached during negotiation that EAAB will maintain the UFW reduction unit fully staffed at all times, to&#13;
monitor, fine tune and coordinate the UFW reduction program.&#13;
4.     Average water consumption per connection is about 32m3,'month, of which about 69% represents&#13;
residential consumption, and about 15% industrial and commercial use, with the rest accounted for by the official&#13;
and "mixed" sectors and by consumption of nearby municipalities. Water consumption does not vary by more&#13;
than 15% on a month by month basis. As discussed in Annex 1, since 1975, average unit water consumption has&#13;
been steadily declining on account of the increase in service levels and corresponding lower water consumption&#13;
by low income groups and increase in service rates. Fears of impending water rationing because of low water&#13;
levels in reservoirs led to the introduction, in the period of electricity rationing, of a water savings campaign in&#13;
the second half of 1992, with only limited and temporary results. However, at the same time, water tariffs were&#13;
raised, and adjusted upwards again in the first semester of 1993. These adjustments would have an impact on&#13;
average consumption and EAAB's revenues. The feasibility of implementing demand management policies&#13;
would be considered in the framework of the Santafe I project.&#13;
5.     The Vulnerability of the BogotA Water Supply System. The Colombian authorities (both National&#13;
and those of the Bogota Capital District) have been concerned by possible scenarios of water rationing in&#13;
Bogota. To address this concern, a vulnerability control component was incorporated in the Santafe I project,&#13;
with a specific goal of ensuring reliable water supply to the city from its two main treatment plants: Wiesner&#13;
and Tibito.&#13;
6.     Analysis of the Bogota water supply system demonstrates that at present both main water supply&#13;
sources are exposed to significant levels of risks which may result in severe interruptions in supply, although the&#13;
probability of such an occurrence, while increasing, is considered still to be small.&#13;
7.     The entire production of the Wiesner plant (14 m3/s) is conveyed to the city through the 2.7 km long, 3.5&#13;
m diameter Usaquen tunnel. This tunnel was built at the same time and used the same construction technology&#13;
as the El Faro tunnel which supplies raw water to the Wiesner plant. The El Faro tunnel has suffered several&#13;
failures in recent years as a consequence of collapse of sections of its unlined walls, with the effect of water&#13;
rationing in Bogota during the repair periods. The vulnerability of the El Faro tunnel was partially addressed in&#13;
the Bogota IV project through construction of the San Rafael reservoir for reserve capacity. However, since the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
latter is only expected to be operational by late 1996, because of delays incurred, the technical issues of the El&#13;
Faro tunnel can only be analyzed and solved after San Rafael comes on stream. Since similar risks could affect&#13;
the safe operation of Usaquen tunnel, the adoption of measures for risk control of that tunnel are of highest&#13;
priority.&#13;
8.     The Tibito treatment plant, with a nominal capacity of 11 m3/s, has not been refurbished for the last 26&#13;
years. Under normal operating conditions it supplies about 4 m3/s. Higher flows if required, can be assured only&#13;
for limited periods of time. The full capacity of the plant needs to be restored in order to ensure reasonable&#13;
water supply in cases of maintenance or emergencies at the Wiesner plant.&#13;
9.     The treated Tibito water is conveyed to the city through two water mains. The larger one, a 2 m&#13;
diameter 55 km prestressed concrete cylinder pipe (PCCP) suffers from corrosion problems which have caused&#13;
eleven failures during the period 1978-1989. At present it is operated at less than half of the design pressure and&#13;
consequently conveys lower flows. Even with present low operations, the risk of bursts still exists, exposing the&#13;
population to flood risks and to unreliable supply in cases of emergency.&#13;
10.    To address the problems mentioned above, a vulnerability control component consisting of three&#13;
operations was included in the project:&#13;
(i)  Rehabilitation of a Section of 31 km of the 2m diameter PCCP Tibito treated water transmission pipeline;&#13;
(ii) Rehabilitation of the Tibito water treatment plant so as to restore its capacity to treat the nominal flow of 11&#13;
(iii) Construction of a backup Usaquen tunnel which will ensure that the treated water of the Wiesner plant will&#13;
reach the city at all times.&#13;
11.    Sewerage and Drainage. About 83% of the population of the capital area was estimated to have&#13;
access, by house connections, to sewerage services by 1990. About 70% of the city is served by a storm&#13;
drainage system. All sewage generated in the city is discharged without treatment into the Bogota River. Service&#13;
levels in sanitation are expected to grow to about 90% for Bogota and 88% for the metropolitan area by the year&#13;
2010. The sewerage and drainage systems are combined in the old sections of the city. In other areas, sewerage&#13;
and drainage are separated. In practice, many illicit or unauthorized connections have been made to the two&#13;
systems, and therefore they operate, to some extent, as a combined system. The problem created by these illicit&#13;
connections must be studied in detail as they are a determining factor in the definition of specific actions. The&#13;
sewerage and drainage systems included some 4,580 km. of pipes, 81 km of canals and 707,000 sewerage&#13;
connections by 1990.&#13;
12.    The domestic and some of the industrial waste water generated in the Bogoti area is collected by&#13;
interceptors parallel to existing natural water courses that were built to discharge their waters directly back to&#13;
these courses below populated areas. As the city has expanded, some of these discharges are now being made in&#13;
densely populated areas, thus preventing orderly urban growth. In addition, overflows of the combined&#13;
sewerage system are also often discharged, under all weather conditions, to the drainage canals (often with&#13;
reduced capacity because of neglect of maintenance) in densely populated areas. These conditions pose high&#13;
health risks to the population. To remedy these problems, existing interceptors need to be extended, and new&#13;
ones built to discharge wastewater farther downstream from populated areas. The natural water courses and&#13;
drainage canals receive the water mn-off which is fmnally discharged into the Bogota River. Levees have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
built on both sides of the river to protect the city from extensive flooding. In the lower reaches of these water&#13;
courses, peak flow attenuation lagoons need to be built to accommodate storm flows before discharging into the&#13;
Bogota River. Pumping stations (in Torca and Tintal) are needed to discharge the storm and waste waters during&#13;
periods of high stage in the Bogota River.&#13;
13.    Feasibility studies and final designs carried out with financing under the Bogota IV Bank operation&#13;
identified and analyzed alternative solutions for improving and expanding the sewage and drainage collection&#13;
and disposal system of the area and recommended the most attractive solution from a technical and economic&#13;
point of view, with a scheme corresponding to the least-cost solution&#13;
14.    Bogota River Pollution. As the most intensively used river in Colombia, the Bogota River is also the&#13;
most polluted. Its principal uses are water supply for human consumption, irrigation, industry, electric power&#13;
generation, and some recreation in the upper basin. The main pollution sources of the Bogota River are domestic&#13;
wastewater, industrial wastes consisting of liquid wastes and sludge, including toxic and hazardous wastes,&#13;
municipal solid wastes, and agricultural run-off. The city of Santafe de Bogoti, located along the middle section&#13;
of the river, is by far the major polluter. The discharges, either direct into the river, or into the three main&#13;
tributaries that cross the city (the Salitre, Fucha and Tunjuelo) include both the wastes of some six million&#13;
inhabitants, and of about 10,000 industries. The estimated total organic load currently discharged to the river&#13;
from the city is about 350 ton/day BOD, out of which about 30% is contributed by industrial wastes. The&#13;
domestic wastes contain large amounts of oxygen-depleting organic matter, and extremely high levels of&#13;
pathogenic organisms. Of the total industries in the metropolitan area, about 3,800 are of a considerable size,&#13;
and about 85% of the industrial discharges are into the Fucha basin (the rest is about equally discharged into the&#13;
Tunjuelo and Salitre basins); the discharges are either direct, or through the sewerage system. In addition to&#13;
their high organic loads, the industrial wastes contain toxic material such as heavy metals. The industrial wastes&#13;
present a special problem in the case of Bogota, requiring specific attention. Unfortunately, the various&#13;
treatment options presented by vendors so far would not help address this problem, and the on-going IDB funded&#13;
project with the area's environmental protection agency (CAR) only deals inter alia, with reducing pollution at&#13;
source from some industries up-river of the city. Approaches to institute a subsidized line of credit to encourage&#13;
pollution-abatement by industries have not so far materialized, and enforcement capacity is negligible. Although&#13;
in the past, disposal of municipal solid wastes in the Bogota River and its tributaries was a major source of&#13;
pollution, since the privatization of collection services in 1988, there have been major improvements, and about&#13;
95% of the city's solid wastes are properly collected and disposed of in the municipal sanitary land fill. In&#13;
marginal zones which are not accessible to collection vehicles, solid wastes are still dumped in the river. In&#13;
general, solid waste disposal does not represent a major source of water pollution, provided that standards of&#13;
collection and disposal remain at least at present levels.&#13;
15.    Since heavy pollution loads are discharged from Bogota to a river of relatively small flow, water quality&#13;
data amply demonstrate that downstream from the first point of discharge of the Bogota wastewater, water&#13;
quality deteriorates drastically. In general, the water downstream of the city and all the way to the confluence of&#13;
the river with the Magdalena River is of very poor quality: practically raw sewage.&#13;
16.    The most severe threat to public health is the potential effect of water with an extremely high content of&#13;
pathogenic organisms flowing in natural, uncovered waterways which cross highly populated residential areas of&#13;
Bogota. Chronic flooding in the metropolitan area (resulting from the topography, and from water brought from&#13;
neighboring watersheds ending up as wastewater discharged to water courses of limited capacity) causes direct&#13;
contact of the population with the contaminated water. In addition, the use of the river water for irrigation in the&#13;
middle and local sections of the Bogota River exposes the population consuming these irrigated food products to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
health hazards, as well as the farm workers and population residing in the vicinity of these irrigated fields. Most&#13;
of the irrigated crops are sold in the Capital District. The high incidence of gastro-intestinal diseases,&#13;
particularly diarrhea, in Santafd de Bogota and neighboring towns is amply documented. The impacts of&#13;
contamination include difficulties in operating the hydroelectric plants, the costs of water treatment, particularly&#13;
at the Tibito in-take, and the unacceptability of use of the river as the water supply source for the small town of&#13;
Agua de Dios in the lower basin.&#13;
17.    The ecological effects of water pollution have been high. Over the last 20 years, many of the species of&#13;
the local fauna and flora have been lost or are severely threatened, and no vertebrates (fish or migratory birds)&#13;
survive in the Bogota River downstream of Bogoti. In addition, given the loss and degradation of habitat in the&#13;
Sabana de Bogota, the once extensive Bogota wetlands have almost disappeared due to land-filling and&#13;
pollution, and with them several unique bird species. Pollution load discharges to the Magdalena River have&#13;
also had an adverse impact on areas outside the Bogota River watershed, although greatly mitigated by the&#13;
dilution factor of 50 to 1 between the two rivers, and the natural aeration effects of the topography.&#13;
18.    CAR defined, in 1987, water quality criteria (see Appendix 1) for different reaches of the Bogota River,&#13;
with the permanent criteria to be achieved from 1998 onwards, thus permitting application of intermediate&#13;
strategies in the preceding period. Quality parameters for 1998 along the middle section of the river, i.e. the&#13;
Capital District, (between the confluence points with the Salitre and Tunjuelo streams) can be achieved by a very&#13;
high level of treatment (probably tertiary treatment) within the city limits, or by collection and conveyance of the&#13;
wastewater of Bogota to a point downstream of the Tunjuelo confluence, and its treatment at this point to a lower&#13;
level (probably secondary treatment followed by disinfection). The results of various pollution control studies&#13;
which have been carried out indicate that the investments required to achieve the quality goals are extremely&#13;
high, estimated at around $1.5 billion, and beyond the current financial capacities of any of the relevant&#13;
agencies. The adoption of pre-defined water quality criteria has meant that these studies, in general, have not&#13;
analyzed the environmental impact of the proposed projects and of the resulting water quality, leading to strictly&#13;
technical approaches which have not incorporated environmental and institutional considerations. In preparing&#13;
the Bogoti V Pollution Abatement Project, the Bank attempted, during the period 1990-92, to contribute to a&#13;
staged, strategic approach, which would have meant in the first phase, construction of an interceptor along the&#13;
Bogota River, carrying out a cost-benefit analysis of different treatment options, a study of the specific problems&#13;
of industrial pollution with recommendations for solutions consolidating the institutional and financial capacity&#13;
to deal with the intrinsic externalities and cost-recovery issues, as well as for wetlands management and&#13;
ecological conservation. With Bank cooperation, the Bogota River Committee (BRC) was established, and a&#13;
simple charter was signed by the then Mayor of Bogota, the heads of the National Planning Department (DNP),&#13;
CAR, EAAB, the Capital District's environmental agency (DAMA); and the Governor of Cundinamarca, with&#13;
the President of the Republic as a witness to the event. Since the BRC was only a technical, advisory committee,&#13;
rather than a policy-making body, it was limited in scope, and could not surmount the intransigent position of&#13;
some agencies down-playing any need for an extensive cost-benefit analysis, and insisting on a definition of the&#13;
problem as only one of EAAB going ahead urgently with waste water treatment.&#13;

1.    CAR, the regulatory agency responsible for the administrative management and control of the&#13;
renewable natural resources in the Bogota river basin, formulated in the Agreement No. 58 of 1987&#13;
(Chapter IV, Article 28) the water quality criteria of the rivers in the area of its jurisdiction, classifying&#13;
water quality in the water courses into one of the four following classes, according to their actual and&#13;
potential use:&#13;
Class A:    Human and domestic use after conventional treatment, flora and fauna preservation&#13;
and use for watering cattle and for agriculture.&#13;
Class B:    Flora and fauna preservation, use for agriculture and cattle.&#13;
Class C:    Agriculture and cattle use.&#13;
Class D.    Energy generation and restricted agricultural and industrial uses.&#13;
The limits of the related parameters for the different classes are:&#13;
CLASS                      A     B       C      D&#13;

Santafe I Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Annex 3 Environmental Issues&#13;
A. Institutions with Responsibilities for Pollution Abatement and Environmental Protection in the&#13;
Project Area&#13;
(i) Regional Autonomous Development Corporation (CAR)&#13;
1     The Corporacion Autonoma Regional de la Sabana de Bogota y de los Valles de Ubate y&#13;
Chiquinquira (CAR) is a public entity whose governance under the new law 99, was recently shifted from&#13;
the National Planning Department (DNP) to the Ministry of the Environment. Within the Bogota River&#13;
watershed, it has ascribed to it many of the environmental management functions (such as protection of&#13;
natural resources, parks and wetlands) of the weak national environmental agency, INDERENA. CAR&#13;
also establishes and implements rural and municipal development policy in the Bogota River watershed and&#13;
regulates land and water use, mineral extraction and power generation (delegated to EEB). CAR manages&#13;
sewerage and waste water treatment in the BogotA valley municipalities outside of the Capital District.&#13;
Within the Capital District these functions are delegated to EAAB. CAR is currently implementing a US $&#13;
70 million IDB loan to extend the supply of water for irrigation and construct waste water treatment plants&#13;
in some 23 towns located in the upper and lower BogotA River drainage. Under the new Law 99, CAR&#13;
along with the other Corporaciones Aut6nomas Regionales, will assume the primary responsibility for&#13;
environmental management in the country, each one in its corresponding area of jurisdiction. In this&#13;
respect CAR would be responsible for the environmental management in the entire basin of the BogotA&#13;
river, excluding the area of the District of BogotA which falls under the responsibility of DAMA.&#13;
Surprisingly, CAR has always been reluctant to become involved in the BogotA river cleanup effort beyond&#13;
setting up standards for water quality in the river and acting as a regulating and policy making agency,&#13;
even though it assumed the function of implementing agency for cleanup works in the upper basin of the&#13;
Bogota river.&#13;
(ii) Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de BogotA (EAAB)&#13;
2.    EAAB, the Borrower and executing agency of the Santafe I project, is responsible for supplying&#13;
water and providing adequate sewerage and storm drainage to the city of Bogota. According to its previous&#13;
and new statutes it is also responsible for treatment of wastewater, but except for having conducted studies,&#13;
it never materialized its responsibility regarding treatment and it has never constructed, owned or operated&#13;
wastewater treatment installations. It monitors the quality of industrial wastes discharged to the municipal&#13;
sewerage network, mainly for the purpose of establishing discharge rates. During the administration of the&#13;
current Mayor, whose term of office ends in December 94, the administrative responsibility for treatment&#13;
of the wastewater of Bogota was transferred from EAAB to DAMA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54-&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
(iii) Departamento Tecnico Administrativo del Medio Ambiente (DAMA)&#13;
3.    The Bogota District Environmental Agency (DAMA) was established in 1990 by the Bogota&#13;
District Council. It is responsible for the city's enviromnental policy, planning and programming and the&#13;
preparation of BogotA's Environmental Management Plan, including regulation and control of urban&#13;
pollution (i.e., contamination of air, water, and land resources) and conservation of the natural environment.&#13;
It is made up of technical and operations sub-directorates, headed by a director who reports to the mayor.&#13;
DAMA is new and inexperienced, and, similarly to other District agencies, has suffered since its&#13;
establishment (and will most probably continue to suffer) from political intervention and frequent changes&#13;
of its Director and senior staff. DAMA's continuity is at risk at every mayoral election, when its senior&#13;
staff are replaced and its charter and functions could be revoked. Its task has been, until now, to increase&#13;
environmental awareness among the industries and general citizenry of BogotA, not to execute projects, but&#13;
it seems that its role is shifting to executing tasks. DAMA was evaluated by the Bank in connection with&#13;
the planning of the Bogota Urban Transport project, within which the Bank has designated some US$&#13;
200,000 to technical assistance for DAMA. The District government has recently approved legislation&#13;
adapting DAMA's objectives and structure to meet the requirements of Ley 99. Building the capacity to&#13;
take on responsibilities which previously fell to the Corporaci6n Aut6noma Regional (CAR) will be a&#13;
major challenge for DAMA in the near future. The agency expects to increase fourfold its current staff of&#13;
around 30 professionals and will require training for new and existing staff.&#13;
4.    Recently, the administrative responsibility for treatment of the wastewater of Bogota was&#13;
transferred from EAAB to DAMA, who has been, for over a year, the District's arm for managing and&#13;
implementing the adopted strategy for the BogotA river pollution abatement. DAMA handled the bidding&#13;
process for selection of a private operator which would build, under a BOT contract, a primary wastewater&#13;
treatment plant at Salitre. The Salitre contract has been recently signed with the French firm Degremont.&#13;
DAMA does not have, at present, the capacity to handle a project of the size of BogotA wastewater&#13;
treatment project and it is doubtful that it is the best qualified and appropriate agency to be in charge of&#13;
implementing this project, for reasons of incompatible mandates of an environmental regulator and an&#13;
implementing agency.&#13;
5.     DAMA has been the interlocutor of the wetlands protection component of the Santafe I project. It&#13;
participated in producing the terms of reference for the Bogota wetlands studies and signed an agreement&#13;
with the Universidad Javeriana according it the role of wetlands management for the next 15 years.&#13;
(iv) Empresa Distrital de Servicios (EDIS)&#13;
6.     The city's solid waste department (EDIS) formerly manage three separate garbage collection&#13;
services and operated Bogota's only sanitary land fill site and was responsible for controlling waste&#13;
dumping into creeks and wetlands. EDIS continue to fulfill its functions until end 1994, by which date&#13;
these services were fully privatized.&#13;
(v) Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota (EEB)&#13;
7.    The BogotA Electric Energy Company (EEB) is a public service utility providing thermal and&#13;
hydro-electrical power to municipalities within the BogotA River drainage. The company has effectively&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
sequestered a considerable portion of the Bogota River below the capital by controlling water levels with a&#13;
dam and storage reservoir at Alicachin. Below the BogotA Savanna the river is piped through three&#13;
successive electrical power generating plants before being returned to its natural bed. As an interested&#13;
party and one of the primary users of the river, coordination between EEB and other stakeholders is&#13;
important in order to forestall and resolve potential inter-institutional conflicts over competing water uses&#13;
and approaches to resolving technical issues.&#13;
(vi) The Ministry of the Environment&#13;
8.     As part of the National Development Plan for 1991-94, the Government outlined a strategy to&#13;
reinforce the strategic coherence of attempts to resolve environmental issues and the institutional&#13;
framework. Following on this strategy, the new Ministry of the Environment (ME), the National Council&#13;
of the Environment and Natural Resources and the National Environmental System (SINA) were created by&#13;
Law 99 in December, 1993. The role of the ME includes definition of policies and regulations for&#13;
management of the environment and use of renewable natural resources, preparation, in coordination with&#13;
DNP of environmental programs and plans, and coordination of sector research. The ME is also&#13;
responsible for the National Environmental Fund and supervises the work of five scientific institutions.&#13;
The ME took over several environmental-related functions and activities previously scattered in various&#13;
institution such as: the Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Mining and Energy, INDERENA and DNP.&#13;
Under Law 99 the "Corporaciones Autonomas Regionales" (CARs) would strengthen their current role of&#13;
policy implementation and increase in number from 18 to 30, to cover the whole national territory.&#13;
Existing CARs have also been transformed into decentralized autonomous entities, independent of the&#13;
central Government, reporting to the Departments, municipalities and other territorial entities under their&#13;
jurisdiction.&#13;
B. Protection of The Wetlands of the Capital District&#13;
9.     The wetlands of the Sabana de Bogota are of special ecological importance. Much of the Sabana was&#13;
originally covered by wetlands and since there are no other comparable wetland areas in the high Andes north of&#13;
Peru, the Sabana was the focus of the evolution of a number of endemic (occurring nowhere else in the world)&#13;
wetland species. For example, with at least 12 endemic species or sub-species of wetland birds, the Sabana de&#13;
BogotA is the most important center of avian endemicity in the Northem Andes. Unfortunately, the Sabana de&#13;
Bogota has been one of the most intensely developed areas of Colombia and more than 94% of these valuable&#13;
wetlands have been drained and filled in. Several of the endemic birds are already extinct and the others are all&#13;
threatened.&#13;
10.   In addition to their importance for biodiversity, these wetlands have a critically important hydrological&#13;
role of flood protection and aquifer replenishment, and have a tremendous recreational potential. The most&#13;
important remaining wetlands are found outside of the Capital District, but some 15 wetlands exist within the&#13;
District.&#13;
11.    The District wetlands are of particular importance to the integrity of the water supply and wastewater&#13;
disposal functions of the EAAB. Because of links between the stormwater and wastewater disposal systems,&#13;
many of the wetlands must absolutely be protected within BogotA. Recognizing their importance, EAAB and the&#13;
Bank have agreed that under the Santafe I Project, EAAB will provide significant support to the protection of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56-&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
wetlands of the Capital District. This support will be mi the form of guaranteed provision of US$ 400,000 per&#13;
year during the duration of the Santafe I Project.&#13;
12.    Within the Capital District, environmental issues are the responsibility of the Departamento&#13;
Administrativo del Medio Ambiente (DAMA). DAMA is not responsible for executing projects but has a&#13;
coordinating flmction. By a recently approved Capital District resolution, all municipal entities must invest, under&#13;
the coordination of DAMA, 1.5% of their operating budgets in environmental programs. In the case of EAAB,&#13;
this percentage represents an amount several times as high as the amount to be provided for wetlands. As such, it&#13;
does not therefore represent the investment of new funds, but the explicit eannarking of this portion for wetlands&#13;
management remains significant as there would not otherwise be a secure and continuous source of finds in the&#13;
near future for protection of the wetlands of Bogoti.&#13;
13.    Recognizing its limited capacity, DAMA has recently signed a number of agreements with local&#13;
universities and NGOs with the objective of assigning the responsibility for various environmental analyses and&#13;
protection plans to these organizations. In the case of responsibility for wetlands, DAMA has signed an&#13;
agreement with the Universidad Javeriana according it the role of wetlands nanagement for the next 15 years.&#13;
The Universidad Javeriana, through its Institute for Sustainable Development, will thus be responsible for&#13;
coordinating with other organizations all wetland protection efforts.&#13;
14. In order to ensure that the annual allocated funds for wetlands protection are spent in the most effective&#13;
and efficient manner, the Santafe I Project includes a study to formulate wetlands management plans and to&#13;
determine funding priorities. Because ofthe Universidad Javeriana's pivotal role in this area, it will carry out this&#13;
study. In addition to help in better defining funding priorities, the study will represent an important training&#13;
exercise for the University, requming mobilization of wetlands experts and extensive cooperation with DAMA,&#13;
CAR, EAAB and with NGOs.&#13;
15.    The cost of this study is estimated at about US$ 200,000 and its funding will be provided by EAAB&#13;
under the Santafe I Project. Preparation of a work plan acceptable to the EAAB and to the Bank will be a&#13;
prerequisite for funding the study. The study is expected to be carried out in 14 months and will allow adequate&#13;
time for the University to develop this expertise and links with other organizations. Provision has been made for&#13;
facilitating emergency investments and actions that are required in the course of the study.&#13;
C. Environmental Institutional Strengthening of EAAB&#13;
16.    EAAB has had up until this time no formal unit or administrative entity specifically concerned with&#13;
environrnental issues. The initiative to foster the creation of an environmental unit under the Santafe I Project&#13;
would constitute an important step towards institutional strengthening of EAAB in order to incorporate&#13;
environmental considerations into performance of its duties.&#13;
17.    An agreement was reached with EAAB during project preparation that an Enviromnental Committee&#13;
would be created within the company. This was deemed more appropriate by representatives of the EAAB than&#13;
the creation of another bureaucratic appendage when efforts are underway to streamline the company.&#13;
18. The Environmental Committee is to report directly to the Vice President for Planning and is to be&#13;
composed of two permanent; full-time members and a number of temporary members as required. The two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
permanent members, who would both dedicate 100% of their time to environmental issues, are to be: i) an&#13;
environmental engineer from the Planning Vice Presidency (Secretary of the Conmiittee) and ii) an environmental&#13;
consultant. EAAB has indicated that the environmental consultant is to be hired as a part of the external audit&#13;
team.&#13;
19.    Temporary members of the Committee would include representatives of other areas of the company such&#13;
as Real Estate, Natural Resources, Community Development, etc. External members would include a&#13;
representative from DAMA. In addition and as required, the Committee would engage specialized consultants&#13;
counting on logistic and financial support from the Planning Division.&#13;
20.    One of the most unportant and immediate tasks of the Committee under the Santafe I Project would be&#13;
to ensure the effective implementation of the Environmental Management Plan proposed in the project's EIA.&#13;
Other activities for which the Committee would be responsible will include:&#13;
-      Fornulating an environmentl policy for EAAB;&#13;
-      Environmental training;&#13;
-      Coordination with other environmental agencies and NGOs;&#13;
-      Coordination of the wetlands protection component;&#13;
-      Public consultation.&#13;

Annex 4 Past Bank Experience in the Water &amp; Sanitation Sector in Colombia&#13;
A.     Record of Bank Supported Projects&#13;
1.     Project completion reports have been prepared for six projects, and four others have had&#13;
Performance Audits. " The audit reports and the supervision of on-going projects show that, in large&#13;
measure, projects have been successful in achieving their physical objectives and, thus, have contributed&#13;
importantly to the development of the water supply and sewerage sector. Most beneficiaries of past Bank&#13;
loans, however, did not attain the institutional and financial performance targets envisioned at appraisal.&#13;
Other deficiencies detected in past experience have been the chronic overestimation of demand for water&#13;
and the frequent implementation delays, which, in an inflationary environment, resulted in cost overruns for&#13;
most of the projects.&#13;
2.     The operations with EAAB were more successful than with the other companies receiving Bank&#13;
financing. The Bank contributed substantially to the development of EAAB into a relatively efficient&#13;
institution. However, mainly because of inadequate tariff increases, lower than expected sales, and project&#13;
cost overruns, EAAB's financial performance declined during a major part of the second and third project&#13;
implementation period - particularly during 1971-75 and 1980-82. To address this problem, an institutional&#13;
strengthening program was included in the Fourth Bogota Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan&#13;
2512-CO). The Action Plan supported under this project was not carried out in important areas related to&#13;
efficiency and EAAB entered a major financial and institutional crisis in 1989-92 because of weak&#13;
management and controls, and a short-term focus created by the governance framework and lack of&#13;
accountability. Intensive Bank supervision contributed to major remedial actions to address crucial&#13;
accounting deficiencies, control costs, and renew a focus on efficiency. In 1993, the Organic Law for&#13;
BogotA was enacted to correct flaws deriving from the governance framework. By mutual agreement, im&#13;
spite of delays in construction of the San Rafael dam financed by Ln.2512-CO, the closing date of&#13;
Ln.2512-CO was not extended beyond June 30, 1993. Instead, alternative financing was secured, and&#13;
disbursements from the loan for goods and services supplied by the closing date were permitted until&#13;
December 31, 1993.&#13;
3.     At present, the Bank is supporting sector investments through projects with the Empresas&#13;
Municipales de Cucuta (Loan 2470-CO), as well as a multi-city lending operation through the new&#13;

national financial intermediary for municipal development, FINDETER (Loan 2961-CO) for the financing&#13;
of about 300 sub-projects in medium and small communities. FINDETER is responsible for the&#13;
identification, appraisal and supervision of these sub-projects. The experience to date on this project is&#13;
positive both in terms of the quality of the sub-projects and in terms of the institution-building benefits that&#13;
have been recorded. Project implementation is on schedule and FINDETER has been effective in reaching&#13;
about 500 municipalities with technical assistance and investment loans aimed at attaining efficient and&#13;
self-sustaining operations&#13;
4.     The Cucuta project has been problematic, mainly because of the politicization and weak&#13;
management of the project entity, leading to serious implementation problems and suspension of the loan in&#13;
1991. Since then, intensive efforts have led to some remedial actions by the Cucuta authorities. In&#13;
Barranquilla, the project with the EPM (Ln. 2637-CO) encountered the same types of problems, leading to&#13;
transfer of the responsibility for water supply, sewerage and solid waste management to a new entity with&#13;
minority private shareholding, and the cancellation of the Bank's loan because of massive non compliance&#13;
with loan conditions.&#13;
B.    General National-Level Experience to Date&#13;
5.    The main problems in the water and sewerage sector as gleaned from the record of the Bank-&#13;
supported project portfolio can be summarized as follows:&#13;
*  political interference in management of water and sewerage services;&#13;
*  institutional weakness and instability are common among the more than 1,000 utility entities&#13;
that provide urban water and sewerage services;&#13;
*  administrative and operational inefficiencies, including lack of trained personnel are also&#13;
widely prevalent;&#13;
*  service quality is poor in a wide range of institutions and municipalities;&#13;
*  tariff adjustments have come mainly in the face of cash flow difficulties; there is also official&#13;
ambivalence about the role of tariffs in the provision of efficient services to all income strata.&#13;
as a consequence, the sector is characterized by vicious cycles of low cost recovery, low&#13;
investments, poor service, and poor maintenance that have sent many of the utilities into a&#13;
downward financial spiral.&#13;
6.     The major sectoral problems have had a detrimental effect on health and living conditions for&#13;
substantial numbers of urban residents, particularly the urban poor. The recently completed Poverty&#13;
Assessment Report (Report No. 126730-CO) of June 1994, has concluded the following from its review of&#13;
the major issues confronting the water and sanitation sector in Colombia:&#13;
*  Lack of access to water and sewerage is mostly a problem for the urban poor. At least 70% of&#13;
the new water and sewerage connections needed to ensure the coverage enjoyed by the highest&#13;
quintile of the population is required by the poorest 40% of Colombian households;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
* This lack of coverage does not reflect unwillingness to pay. In the main cities, urban&#13;
households in the lowest decile spend up to 9% of their income on water and sewerage, while the&#13;
population at large spends only between I to 2 percent;&#13;
* Illegal connections average 7% nationwide; in the lowest decile, they represent 10%; however,&#13;
these mask a wide range of variations with some cities showing a level of illegal connections as&#13;
high as 18%, with 43% of services to the lowest income decile being illegal in nature;&#13;
*  Subsidies are better targeted in the water and sanitation sector than in the case of electricity&#13;
services; nevertheless, targeting is far from adequate; although water and sewerage service&#13;
coverage is lower and more regressive than in the case of energy, the better design of the tariff&#13;
structure compensates for some of this regressive structure.&#13;
7.     The Poverty Assessment Report has made a number of recommendations with regard to future&#13;
Bank operations in the sector, including:&#13;
* need to improve information about the household stratification and their geographical&#13;
distribution in order to design better targeted programs to expand service coverage in the sector;&#13;
* need to set relative goals for targeting in rural and urban areas, taking into account costs and&#13;
benefits of expanding coverage in urban areas that are nearing universal coverage, and instead&#13;
concentrating on reducing UFW and improving quality in such areas.&#13;
* with regard to tariff structure, an urgent priority is the need to design and restructure tariff&#13;
systems that provide incentives to improved public awareness of the true cost of water and&#13;
sewerage services and to targeting social subsidies in such a manner that they reach the poor;&#13;
-  the current neglect of wastewater treatment raises serious environmental concerns, and points&#13;
to the need for concerted action at all levels to deal with the health and economic welfare of all&#13;
residents, especially the poor, who live in marginal settlements along polluted waterways;&#13;
* greater use of community participation in the delivery of water and sewerage services is need&#13;
to enhance sector efficiency and to better target those sections of the population that most require&#13;
better service coverage and improved service quality; greater use of the private sector in the&#13;
provision of services through subcontracting arrangements and through equity participation is to be&#13;
actively encouraged .&#13;

Annex 5 EAAB Institutional Assessment And Performance Plan&#13;
A.    General&#13;
1.     EAAB is an autonomous municipal enterprise responsible for delivering drinking water, sewerage and&#13;
drainage services for the Capital Distnct of santa Fe de Bogota. Through various contractual arrangements,&#13;
EAAB also serves six nearby satellite municipalities. Water service in Bogota originated 106 years ago as a&#13;
municipal dependency. EAAB was formally created in 1955 as a municipal decentralized company. Today,&#13;
EAAB serves almost a million connections, which covers more than 90% of Bogota's population. Despite flaws,&#13;
EAAB has, overall, a good reputation among its clients.&#13;
2.     During the last decade, a steady deterioration led to an institutional and financial crisis, the result of lack&#13;
of institutional autonomy and continuous weak management controls. In the past two years, however, EAAB&#13;
mianaged to turn this tendency around by achieving significant improvements in its performance and in its&#13;
institutional and financial capacity. This trend still continues supported by a new more favorable external&#13;
institutional context with greater autonomy, by a qualified management team with strategic vision and, also, by&#13;
the support of the National Government which has agreed to refinance EAAB's external debt in exchange for&#13;
structural reforms. This positive trend, however, requires continued support and further improvements are needed&#13;
to consolidate systemic change and secure EAAB from rtning to past patterns. Also, there is room for&#13;
efficiency gains and to provide better and more effective service to users.&#13;
3.     During 1993 the administration of EAAB formulated, in collaboration with the National Government, a&#13;
strategic development plan which focuses on the company's financial recovery, efficiency gains, modernization,&#13;
and the introduction of a new managerial culture. The concrete objectives and institutional targets, are specified in&#13;
a legally binding contract signed between EAAB and the National Government. The Santafe I project, through its&#13;
technical assistance and institutional strengthening components, aims at supporting EAAB's key programs in its&#13;
development strategy, including: Unaccounted for Water (UFW) reduction and the development of Management&#13;
Information Systems (MIS). An assessment of the company is provided below.&#13;
B.     Description of Organization, and Institutional Arrangements&#13;
1 .    Type of Institution&#13;
4.     EAAB is an Industrial and Commercial enterprise of the Capital District of Bogota. In response to a&#13;
constitutional mandate, EAAB's legal status was recently defined by Decree/Law 1421, of July 21, 1993, issued&#13;
by the National Government and known as the Organic Statute for santa Fe de Bogota. Through this new legal&#13;
status EAAB acquired administrative, budgetary and contracting autonomy.2&#13;
2  Law 142/1994 better known as the Law of Public Services, further underscores this status by limiting the possible status of all&#13;
water companies to either stock societies or Industrial and Commercial enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
2.     Institutional Context&#13;
5.     Several institutions at the National and municipal level, as well as from the pnrvate sector are&#13;
stakeholders in the current institutional context of EAAB. At the National level key institutions are the Ministry&#13;
Of Finance, the National Planning Department (DNP), and the Ministry of Development through both the&#13;
Regulatory Commission for Water and Sanitation, and the Water and Sanitation Directorate. The Ministry of&#13;
Finance and DNP approve EAAB's external borrowing programs. Also, the newly created Ministry of&#13;
Environment, acting directly and indirectly through CAR, the river basin authority, has responsibility for&#13;
oversight on environmental issues. In the near future EAAB, like other public service utilities, will also be subject&#13;
to the oversight of a Superintendency for Public Services which is to be created in response to a constitutional&#13;
mandate.&#13;
6.     At the municipal level, key institutions include: the City Council, the Mayor's office, CONFIS, a fiscal&#13;
and budgetary policy municipal institution, the District Planning Office, and DAMA, the environmental&#13;
coordination authority for Bogota. The Mayor of santa F6 de BogotA is elected for three-year periods; reelection&#13;
for the subsequent period is not penmitted. The Mayor, as the head of the District, appoints EAAB's General&#13;
Manager, chairs the company's board and appoints four of its six members (see paragraph 7.). The City Council,&#13;
which has now only limited interaction with EAAB, approves major structural reforms, such as a change of&#13;
EAAB's legal status, and also its overall borrowing ceiling. Relationships with other Non Governmental&#13;
institutions include the company's Union, and the "Juntas de Administracion Local" (JALs), decentralized&#13;
community organizations for local development and grass-roots representation. External control agencies&#13;
comprise a number of institutions including: the office of the District Comptroller for fiscal matters, and several&#13;
other control offices such as the "Personeria Distrital", and the "Procuraduria", "Fiscalia", "Defensoria" and&#13;
"Veeduria" at the National level.&#13;
3.     Board of Directors&#13;
7.     A seven-member Board of Directors governs EAAB. Its members include: the city Mayor, who acts as&#13;
the chairman, four representatives from the Capital District, all appointed by the Mayor, a delegate of the social&#13;
organizations3, (currently represented by the Director of ACODAL, the leading water sector association) and a&#13;
delegate of residential customers of EAAB. Currently, EAAB's Board consists of well reputed and qualified&#13;
members. The Board's functions concentrate on policy issues and strategic deliberations, and approval of EAAB's&#13;
global budget and borrowing&#13;
4.     Management&#13;
8.     EAAB's General Manager acts as the legal representative of EAAB. According to the Organic Statute&#13;
for BogotA, such position is fully responsible for the overall management of the company, including the&#13;
appointment of all of EAAB's employees, and for all of its contracting. In contrast with the previous co-&#13;
administration scheme, this arrangement has given EAAB a high degree of autonomy. The current General&#13;
3 This member will be a representative of one of the following: Chamber of commerce of Bogota, Federation of&#13;
Metallurgical Industries (Fedemetal), Association of the water sector (ACODAL), Association of cooperatives&#13;
(ASCOOP) and federation of community associations of Bogota.&#13;

Manager is a reputed professional. Second-level officials are also high qualified professionals. The level of&#13;
professionalism is high.&#13;
5.     Organizational structure&#13;
9.    In August, 1993 EAAB's General Manager adopted a new organizational structure. This reorganization&#13;
was designed intemally, in the context of the broader modemization and development strategy for the company.&#13;
The current organizational structure is client-oriented, seeks functional specialization among areas and favors&#13;
modem strategic managerial functions. Major shifts from the previous organizational structure include: (i)&#13;
strengthening of the Intemal Control and Information areas, (which now respond directly to the General&#13;
Manager); (ii) the creation of new staff areas such as the Community Response Office and an Applied Studies&#13;
Center; and (iii) redistribution of functions, with better defined responsibilities and better coordination of&#13;
previously dispersed procedures. This reorganization of EAAB also led to down-sizing from a previously heavy&#13;
bureaucratic structure by eliminating one managerial level (93 departments) and eliminating 26 third level units.&#13;
10.    The current major organizational divisions reporting to the General Manager include: commercial,&#13;
financial, planning, technical (responsible for construction), operations, and administrative. Staff areas directly&#13;
responding to the General Manager include the Secretary General (responsible for procurement and legal issues),&#13;
Intemal Audit (internal control), Unaccounted For Water, Community Affairs and a technical research center.&#13;
Attachment 1 presents the organic structure of EAAB up to its third level.&#13;
C.    EAAB's Performance Assessment&#13;
11.    Overall, the assessment indicates that most of EAAB 's structural and performance problems have been&#13;
addressed or are currently under improvement. These refer mainly to autonomy, accountability and efficiency of&#13;
the company. Apart from the strong commitment to resolve these issues shown by EAAB during the preparation&#13;
of Santafe I (through its strategic plan and following actions), these objectives have been strongly endorsed and&#13;
underpinned by both the National Govenmment through the PP and by the Bank through Santafe I project. In&#13;
short, the new Superintendency of Public Services will also help control EAAB's performance. and achievements&#13;
Despite these improvements two issues are worth highlighting: EAAB's autonomy status, and as a direct&#13;
consequence the recent high management turnover. A more detailed discussion of these two issues follow:&#13;
1.     Autonomy&#13;
12.    As mentioned, the Organic Law of the Capital District provided EAAB with autonomy in budgeting,&#13;
contracting and staffing, thus setting the baseline for the National Govenmment to enter into the performance&#13;
agreement and for the Bank to consider the processing of Santafe I. EAAB's autonomy was further enhanced by&#13;
the Law 142, by: (i) stating that general managers can only be removed because of not compliance with their&#13;
functions, (ii) permitting all utilities to establish their own contractual procedures, and (iii) establishing a&#13;
regulatory and control system, based on negotiated performance plans and, including external audits as inputs.&#13;
However, there's room for further improvement in the company's autonomy. As an example, table I below&#13;
compares some autonomy-related aspects between the current company and that of a mixed capital utility, which&#13;
is the type of institution envisaged in Law 142.&#13;

2.     Management Turnover&#13;
13.   High turnover of EAAB's General Manager, and the negative consequences on the company's&#13;
performance, is still a pending problem. During the previous mayor's mandate (a 2V/2 years transition&#13;
period to 3 years for the present and following mayors) he appointed three managers for EAAB. All of&#13;
these General Managers, in turn, filled most of the company's second-level positions with new-comers and,&#13;
sometimes, inexperienced managers. While Law 142 states that managers in utilities can only be removed&#13;
for unsatisfactory performance, it doesn't fully prevent the above mentioned tendency to continue.&#13;
14.    To overcome these and other autonomy and efficiency related issues The National Government, EAAB&#13;
and the Bank share the appreciation that EAAB has to explore new institutional options for providing the water&#13;
and sewerage services. These options would include the participation of the private sector in various possible&#13;
ways and scopes. For this, Santafe I project supports the elaboration of a comprehensive study of institutional&#13;
alternatives for EAAB and provides funds to apply the results of such study after the necessary consensus on the&#13;
way to go are reached (see para. ).&#13;
15.    Table 2, below, describes EAAB's performance including: i) key issues or past and current problems; ii)&#13;
current achievements by EAAB at appraisal; and iii) the expected improvements with the support of the SantafE&#13;

[Colombia&#13;
Santafe I Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Annex 6 Private Sector Participation Program&#13;
A.    Background&#13;
1.    As part of its modernization program Colombia has involved private sector participation in many&#13;
of its public-owned enterprises. Ports, roads and railways are the most important recent examples. In&#13;
regard to the water sector, in the recent past some examples in midsize cities have taken place with different&#13;
forms of private sector participation. These cases range from intensive use of subcontracting to sharing&#13;
ownership of utilities with the private sector (mixed-capital shareholding companies). The newly approved&#13;
Law of Public Services (Law 142) strongly underpins this option by promoting the share holding form of&#13;
administration for water utilities and by introducing better regulatory framework and removing barriers for&#13;
private sector participation.&#13;
2.     Private sector participation in EAAB is not a new idea. Since the 1970's EAAB began&#13;
subcontracting some of its operations, including meter reading, all major expansion studies and some&#13;
maintenance. Today, after a recent expanding of this practice, EAAB has extended its subcontracting to&#13;
encompass also cafeteria and restaurant services, new connections, transport service and bill distribution,&#13;
to name a few. Currently, EAAB decided to contract out to a private firm the commercial operations (meter&#13;
reading, billing and collection) of all large customers ( with consumption of over 350 m3/month).&#13;
3.    These subcontracting practices have proven valuable in terms of being efficient and low cost,&#13;
compared with EAAB's high internal cost, explained mainly by high personnel non-wage benefits and, in&#13;
certain areas, low productivity. This practice has also given EAAB experience on how to regulate and&#13;
administer contracts with private firms. Despite these efforts, EAAB still remains by and large a public&#13;
utility with all its assets owned by the Capital District and the vast majority of its operational cost (88%)&#13;
administered in-house. As part of its corporate plan, EAAB has coincided with the Capital District and the&#13;
National Government in the need to further increase and develop new ways of private sector participation.&#13;
B.    Reasons for Increasing Private Sector Participation&#13;
4.     The need to expand private sector involvement in EAAB stems from three main reasons:&#13;
(i) despite recent achievements through enacting new statutes for EAAB and the Law of public&#13;
services, and consequent limits on political interference in day-to-day operations, the scope for management&#13;
effectiveness is still restricted compared to what would prevail in the private sector. In particular, the&#13;
degree of management autonomy in such matters as personnel decisions, procurement and contracting,&#13;
long-term financial planning and corporate strategy, are limited by the inherent nature of the public entity.&#13;
In the medium term, transition to a corporate form with equity participation of the private sector will be the&#13;
only way of ensuring sufficient autonomy of management action and accountability to ensure enhanced&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
(ii) significant capital investments will be needed in the near future for the development of new&#13;
water supply sources and for wastewater treatment, estimated at US$ 1 billion and US$ 1.5 billion&#13;
respectively.  Funds for such investments could be raised only with some form of private sector&#13;
participation; and&#13;
(iii) there is room for efficiency improvement in EAAB which may be achieved by tackling the&#13;
problems of overstaffing, unduly high non-wage benefits and low productivity.&#13;
C.    Private sector participation program&#13;
5.     The increase in private sector participation will be achieved in several stages: In the inmiediate-&#13;
tenn, the efforts would focus on extending the contracting-out practice. This would comprise further&#13;
contracting out of operational functions, including a contract for providing new domestic meters and&#13;
maintaining all of Bogota's meters. Other contracts will include extensive maintenance of water and&#13;
sewerage pipes (both preventive and corrective), maintenance of canals, vehicle maintenance and repair,&#13;
separation of the network into operating sectors, and repairs in water treatment plants. All of these&#13;
subcontracts will become operational before the end of 1995. In addition, EAAB plans to assess the&#13;
feasibility of entering into a concession agreement with the private sector which would carry out the&#13;
refurbishment and subsequently the operation (similar to BOT but with rehabilitation instead of building)&#13;
of the Tibito water treatment plant, and the feasibility of a concession for the construction and operation of&#13;
the Usaquen backup tunnel and power generating facility.&#13;
6.    In the long term, the strategy focuses on considering alternatives for EAAB's corporate&#13;
restructuring including substantial divesting of the capital District's ownership, aimed at ensuring&#13;
managerial autonomy and accountability, reducing political intervention and interference and enhancing&#13;
operational efficiency in delivery of services by allowing greater participation of the private sector in the&#13;
management and operation of EAAB and in provision of the water and sewerage in Bogota, and addressing&#13;
the requirements for large investments in development of new water supply sources for Bogota and in&#13;
providing wastewater treatment, within a broader urban development strategy. BOT contracts seem to be a&#13;
promising method for attracting private sector investments to developing of new water supply sources for&#13;
Bogota and for expanding the existing ones, as well as for financing Bogota's wastewater treatment&#13;
facilities. If the BOT option would be adopted, unbundling of the company's functions of water production,&#13;
water distribution and wastewater treatment might take place and the separation of EAAB into two or three&#13;
different companies would have to be considered.&#13;
7.    In order to explore the opportunities for private sector participation and prepare the adjustment&#13;
process, EAAB will embark upon a study which would analyze different alternatives and recommend the&#13;
most adequate avenue, which would be implemented in the framework of Santafe I project, if approved by&#13;
all the stakeholders.&#13;
8.    A steering committee, including EAAB, the Capital District and representatives of the National&#13;
Government will administer the restructuring process. The proposed institutional adjustment and private&#13;
sector participation study would be carried out in two phases. The first one will lay out and analyze all&#13;
meaningful alternatives. This analysis would be done vis-a-vis the objectives set out for the privatization&#13;
process, aimed at ensuring autonomy, capital needs, efficiency gains and public acceptance. The results of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
this analysis would be presented to the steering committee which would select the most adequate alternative&#13;
for EAAB's transformation. The study would outline an action plan for implementing the structural&#13;
adjustment. If the recommendations of the study would be acceptable to the Colombian and Capital&#13;
District authorities and to the Bank, the second phase would then be carried out, focusing on the detailed&#13;
design of the transformation process and on formulating a detailed action plan for its implementation,&#13;
including preparation of bidding operations, if warranted, followed by implementation of the&#13;
transformation process.&#13;
9.     The deadline for initiating the study is January 1996. The selection of EAAB's institutional&#13;
restructuring alternative should be taken by January 1997. If decided to proceed with the process, the&#13;
detailed designs and transformation would depend on the alternative chosen and on the need to prepare and&#13;
implement bidding operations as part of it.&#13;
10.    The Santafe I project will support EAAB's enhancement of private sector participation. Most of&#13;
the measures mentioned would be supported by Bank funds, along with close follow-up and advise, if&#13;
needed. The progress in EAAB's privatization process would be monitored continuously. During the mid-&#13;
term review, decisions would be taken in regard to required continuing technical assistance or change of&#13;
strategy, if warranted.&#13;

ANNEX 9&#13;
Colombia&#13;
Santafe I Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Annex 9 Economic Analysis: Methodology and Results&#13;
A. Cost- Benefit Analysis&#13;
A. Methodology&#13;
1.    The economic rate of return was calculated by comparing the costs and benefits of piped water and&#13;
sewerage services in two scenarios: one in which the project is implemented and one in which the project is&#13;
not implemented. All costs and benefits are expressed in constant prices. The prices used in the analysis are&#13;
adjusted for the impact of taxes and subsidies. Shadow exchange rates and prices were not estimated, due&#13;
to lack of sufficient reliable data.&#13;
2.     The "with the project" scenario includes investments aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the&#13;
water system, thus enhancing the reliability of the system substantially. The rehabilitation of the Tibito&#13;
treatment plant and one of the transmission pipelines that connects the treatment plant with the Bogota&#13;
Metropolitan Area would result in an effective expansion4 of the production capacity of about 7 m3 per&#13;
second. The project also includes a number of investments that will increase the efficiency of EAAB's&#13;
operations aiming at reducing the unaccounted-for water, and improving the collection efficiency. The&#13;
production capacity expansion and the efficiency improvements, in combination with an expansion of the&#13;
distribution system, will enable EAAB to accommodate future demand growth. In the year 2000, EAAB&#13;
will be able to supply its services to more than 1 million new customers. Moreover, the project would aim&#13;
at reducing the risk of flooding in especially low-income areas. The project also includes an environmental&#13;
program for the protection and the management of the wetlands of Bogota. In addition, the project will&#13;
finance technical assistance to strengthen the institutional, financial and environmental capacity of the&#13;
company to efficiently operate the company.&#13;
3.     Without the project, it is likely that all these investments will not take place. In the "without&#13;
project" scenario, rationing will occur continuously, while in the "with project" scenario rationing will no&#13;
longer be necessary from 1999 onwards. Nevertheless, by the year 2014 rationing will occur as demand&#13;
will outstrip the available production capacity again.&#13;
4. The current nominal production capacity is 25 m3 per second. However, only 17.7 m3 per second can be effectively&#13;
used. Rehabilitation of the Tibito plant will enable EAAB to use all its nominal production capacity effectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
B. Calculation Of Project Benefits&#13;
4.     The economic justification for the project is based on the benefits it would generate in the form of&#13;
higher water sales and cost savings from investments that promote efficiency in water supply and sewerage.&#13;
These benefits will mainly stem from the rehabilitation of the water supply and sewerage network, and the&#13;
implementation of the water loss reduction program.&#13;
5.     The project would also foster a number of non-quantifiable benefits. The unavailability of reliable&#13;
data have precluded a quantitative estimation of these benefits. These benefits include health benefits,&#13;
environmental benefits, cost savings from postponed investment, increased property values in flood prone&#13;
areas, and benefits associated with the institutional strengthening of the capacity of EAAB to plan and&#13;
manage its resources. The expansion of the water supply and sewerage network in low-income areas in&#13;
Bogota will generate health benefits. The incremental consumer surplus could be substantial because an&#13;
increase in aggregate water consumption and improved service quality will increase the consumer's&#13;
willingness to pay. However, illegal connections are an important drain on the revenues of the EAAB. It is&#13;
evident, that the present project that will include a program to legalize illegal connections, will have a&#13;
negative impact on the consumer surplus of this type of consumer. Rehabilitation will extend the lifetime&#13;
of the water supply and sewerage network, postponing the need for new investment. An indirect benefit of&#13;
the expansion of water supply, sewerage and drainage services in the low-income areas will be to increase&#13;
property values for households that get access to the piped water system. The institutional strengthening&#13;
program could also have a positive impact on the implementation of the other project investments.&#13;
6.     The project components aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the present system will result - in&#13;
combination with an expansion of the distribution system - in an increase of the effective production&#13;
capacity by 7.3 cubic meters per second from 17.7 m3 per second in 1994 to 25 m3 per second in 2002.&#13;
Moreover, the available water supply will increase due to the reduction of unaccounted-for water losses.&#13;
These losses are currently around 40% and will decline to 28% in 2002.&#13;
7.    The incremental revenues from the sale of future water and sewerage services have been used as a&#13;
proxy for direct-use benefits. The average water and sewerage tariff is currently US$0.44 per m3 (in July&#13;
1993 prices). To ensure financial viability, the average tariff has to be gradually increased to US$0.48 per&#13;
cubic meter by 1998. This higher rate has been used as a proxy to calculate project benefits. This tariff is&#13;
higher than the rates domestic consumers will actually pay, since cross-subsidies in the water rate have not&#13;
been considered in the calculation of project benefits. In addition, the collection efficiency will increase&#13;
from 80% in 1994 to 92% in 2000 as part of the water loss reduction program.&#13;
C. Internal Economic Rate Of Return&#13;
8.    The evaluation of the economic viability of the Santa Fe I Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
Rehabilitation Project includes benefits from higher water sales and cost savings described in para. 5, the&#13;
investment costs, and operation and maintenance costs projected for the period under review. The fixed&#13;
operation and maintenance costs of the project are only 1.5%, as it has been assumed that the increase in&#13;
effective production capacity will not require new staff, because the current staff per connection ratio still&#13;
leaves room for further improvement. The variable operation and maintenance cost will increase&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
substantially as the energy and chemical cost of the Tibito treatment plant are much higher than those of&#13;
the Wiesner plant.&#13;
9.    A discount rate of 10 percent is used to calculate the net present value resulting from the project.&#13;
To reflect true costs and benefits, financial prices have been transformed into economic prices. The major&#13;
difference between financial and economic prices involves the impact of taxes and subsidies. In addition,&#13;
price contingencies are not included in the total investment costs since it has been assumed that the prices&#13;
of goods and services acquired under the project will rise in line with general inflation. Investment and&#13;
operation and maintenance costs are adjusted for the impact of subsidies and taxes. The base-case scenario&#13;
is defined as the scenario in which only the benefits of higher water sales and cost savings are included. The&#13;
net present value of the project is US$ 209 million, the intemal economic rate of return is 17 percent, and&#13;
the benefit-cost ratio is 1.49.&#13;
D. Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
10.   In the sensitivity analysis the impact of a number of variables has been tested. These variables&#13;
comprise the impact of cost overruns, higher fixed operation and maintenance cost, changes in water rates,&#13;
project delays, changes in the decline in the unaccounted-for water, changes in collection efficiency and the&#13;
impact of the price elasticity of demand.&#13;
11.   Impact of cost overruns. The project's sensitivity to cost overruns has been tested. The switching&#13;
value (i.e., value when the project becomes nonviable) for cost overruns of total investment is about 54&#13;
percent. If investment (and consequently the fixed operation and maintenance cost) were to increase by&#13;
more than 54 percent, the project would become economically not viable.&#13;
12.   Impact of higher fixed operation and maintenance cost. The fixed operation and maintenance&#13;
cost are set at 1.5 percent of total investment. The low fixed operation and maintenance cost are based on&#13;
the assumption that there is still ample room for improving the efficiency of the company. If the fixed&#13;
operation and maintenance cost increases to 7.7 percent of total investment the project will no longer be&#13;
viable.&#13;
13.   Impact of project delays. One of the major risks comected to the project are related to&#13;
institutional weaknesses which could have an important impact on the project implementation. If the project&#13;
is delayed by two years and the project were to close in 2003 instead of 2001, the net present value would&#13;
decline to US$183 million, the intemal rate of return would drop to 16%, while the benefit-cost ratio would&#13;
fall to 1.43. If the project is started one year later than originally envisaged, the net present value would&#13;
decline to US$ 184 million.&#13;
14.   Impact of water rate changes. If no rate increases were implemented, the net present value of the&#13;
project would decline to US$ 162 million, the intemal economic rate of return would be 16 percent, and the&#13;
benefit-cost ratio 1.38.&#13;
15.   Impact of higher unaccounted-for water. If it is assumed that the water loss reduction program&#13;
is unsuccessful and that it will not result in any reduction of the unaccounted-for water in either scenario,&#13;
the project will still remain profitable. If the unaccounted-for water ratio were to remain at its present level&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
of 40%, the net present value would decline to US$ 27 million, whereas the internal rate of return would&#13;
decline to 11% and the benefit-cost ratio would drop to 1.06. However, if EAAB succeeds in reducing the&#13;
unaccounted-for water to levels that are targeted (i.e., 18 percent in 2000) in the agreements between the&#13;
national govemment and EAAB, the net present value will increase substantially.&#13;
16.    Impact of a lower collection efficiency. If it is assumed that the collection efficiency will not&#13;
increase to 92 percent in 2000, but will remain in either scenario at its level of 80 percent, the net present&#13;
value will decline to US$ 25 million, whereas the intemal rate of return would decline to 11 percent and the&#13;
benefit cost ratio would drop to 1.06.&#13;
17.    Impact of the introduction of price elasticity of demand. In the current demand analysis, no&#13;
price elasticity mechanism has been introduced. In the current scenario, per capita residential consumption&#13;
is assumed not to be affected by these price increases. However, studies in other parts of Latin America&#13;
have shown that residential customers do react to rate increases by reducing their consumption. If it is&#13;
assumed that the price elasticity of residential demand is -0.305, the net present value of the project declines&#13;
to US$ 192 million, the internal rate of return would drop to 16 percent, while the benefit-cost ratio&#13;
wouldfall to 1.46.&#13;
18.    The combined impact of key variables. A very pessimistic scenario that could occur during&#13;
project implementation is a reduced tariff increase, the existence of a price elasticity mechanism, limited&#13;
success in improving the collection efficiency, a limited reduction of the unaccounted-for water and a cost&#13;
overrun. If it is assumed that water and sewerage rates will only increase by half as is needed to ensure&#13;
financial viability, price elasticity is -0.30, the collection efficiency will improve only to 85 percent,&#13;
investment cost will tum out 20% higher than initially anticipated and unaccounted-for water will decline to&#13;
only 32 percent, the project would no longer be viable, as the net present value would tum negative to US$&#13;
-36 million, whereas the internal rate of return would decline to 9% and the benefit-cost ratio to 0.93.&#13;
B. Marginal Cost Pricing&#13;
19.    The long-run average incremental costs were calculated separately for EAAB's water supply and&#13;
sewerage system. The planning horizon covers 30 years and the opportunity cost of capital is set at 10&#13;
percent. In the mnarginal cost calculations, all cost components have been transformed from market prices&#13;
into economic prices by excluding the impact of taxes and subsidies. Shadow prices have not been&#13;
estimated.&#13;
5. The value of a price elasticity of residential demand is based on the results of recent studies in other parts of Latin&#13;
America. Other studies have also shown that non-residential demand is affected by changes in water tariffs. However,&#13;
calculating a price elasticity for non-residential demand is more difficult as the value of the price elasticity depends on factors&#13;
such as the type of industries and their specific water needs, which depend on the quality and quantity of water supply&#13;
required in the production process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 9&#13;
A. Capacity Expansion Costs&#13;
20.   Incremental costs in water supply and sewerage systems result from new investment and the&#13;
operation and maintenance of this additional capacity. Investment or capacity costs for water supply&#13;
consist of investments for institutional development, water treatment, transmission, distribution, and&#13;
connections. They also include investments to reduce water losses. Rehabilitation investments are&#13;
considered equivalent to investments in water intake since they result in increased water supply. For&#13;
sewerage, capacity costs include investments for project management, sewerage connections, collectors,&#13;
and interceptors. Incremental fixed operation and maintenance costs are estimated at 1.5 percent of the&#13;
accumulated capacity investment, assuming further efficiency improvements in the operation of EAAB.&#13;
Total capacity costs are equal to the sum of capacity investment costs and incremental fixed operation and&#13;
maintenance costs. The net present value of these costs is calculated using an assumed opportunity cost of&#13;
10 percent.&#13;
B. Incremental Operating Costs&#13;
21.    The marginal operating costs are calculated as the cost of the last water source used to satisfy&#13;
demand. In Bogota, the available effective production capacity is currently insufficient to satisfy demand.&#13;
The marginal operating cost has therefore been estimated assuming that the Tibito treatment plant&#13;
(including the transmission pipes that connect Tibito with the Bogota Metropolitan Area) is the marginal&#13;
source. The unit costs of all variable inputs (energy and chemicals) needed to produce an additional cubic&#13;
meter of water have been determined at US$ 0.04.&#13;
22.    The main type of variable operation cost in a sewerage system are energy costs. Because the&#13;
sewerage system in Bogota is - with a few exceptions - gravity-based, variable operation costs are therefore&#13;
assumed to be zero.&#13;
C. Long-Run Average Incremental Costs&#13;
23.   Long-run average incremental costs have been calculated at each stage of the project as the ratio of&#13;
the sum of the present value of capacity costs, plus incremental operating costs to the sum of present values&#13;
of the incremental volume of water. In this project, the incremental volume of water results from a&#13;
reduction of unaccounted-for-water, and a rehabilitation of the supply network. The long-run average&#13;
incremental cost is computed based on incremental water production. It is thus necessary to adjust for&#13;
water losses in order to calculate the marginal cost per consumed cubic meter. Based on the current&#13;
distribution of water losses and the expected change in these losses once the project is implemented, a loss&#13;
adjustment factor has been calculated (Figure 1). The table on page 98 presents the long-run average&#13;
incremental costs for different stages of the water production process. The total long-run average&#13;
incremental cost is US$ 0.33 per cubic meter consumed.&#13;
24.    Since the sewerage network does not face variable operating costs, long-run average incremental&#13;
costs are equal to the ratio of the present value of expansion capacity cost to the present value of the&#13;
incremental volume of water sold. The volume of sewage produced per connection is estimated at 85&#13;
percent of the volume of water consumed. Based on these assumptions, the long-run average incremental&#13;
cost for sewage is US$ 0.22 per cubic meter consumed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 9&#13;
25.    The long-run average incremental cost for water supply and sewerage is US$ 0.55, based on the&#13;
investments required for the Santa Fe I Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation Project. The proposed&#13;
project will enable EAAB to service customers until 2013. After 2013, the production capacity will be&#13;
insufficient to satisfy demand, and new investments will be required. These new investments will involve&#13;
expensive altematives, such as the Chingaza expansion and the development of the Sumapaz Alto Muna.&#13;
Moreover, wastewater is currently not treated but directly disposed of in the Bogota river. The consequent&#13;
pollution will increase in the coming years due to the increase in population, which will result in bigger&#13;
wastewater flows. It is evident that this pollution problem has to be resolved.&#13;
26.    Based on preliminary data from recent studies, the required water supply investments will be close&#13;
to US$ 0.9 billion (in constant prices of 1993), whereas the required investment for sewerage treatment will&#13;
top US$ 1.1 billion (in constant prices of 1993). Based on these data, the long-run average incremental&#13;
_cost for water supply and sewerage (excluding the proposed investment under Santa Fe I Water Supply and&#13;
Sewerage Rehabilitation project) will increase sharply to US$ 1.21 for water supply and US$ 1.04 for&#13;
sewage compared to the US$ 0.33 for water supply and US$ 0.22 for sewage at present. The high cost of&#13;
new projects will have major implications, and will need to be taken into account in future sector strategies.&#13;
27.    An estimate of the LRAIC is also calculated on the basis of the assumed investment scenarios for new&#13;
water source development and for the major investments needed in wastewater treatmnent. The LRAIC has been&#13;
adjusted for the levels of water losses at each stage of the process. Chart 1 attached to this Annex shows the&#13;
present water balance in the Bogota metropolitan area. Table 2 shows the details of the calculations. The&#13;
incremental water production is estimated at the average rate of increase observed over the past decade, and that&#13;
is the current basis for EAAB's water source planning.&#13;
28.    The marginal cost pricing shows that the present level of average tariffs covers only a small part of the&#13;
calculated very long- run LRAIC for water and sewerage and wastewater treatment. As the wastewater treatment&#13;
plants are completed, it will become necessary to more than double the average tariffs in order to meet the costs&#13;
for providing these services. No attempt has been made at this juncture to evaluate the potential effects of such&#13;
hkely increases on the affordability, nor the willingness to pay of the average household in Bogota. It must be&#13;
stressed that the time horizon of the economic analysis is substantially longer than the financial forecasts.&#13;
Moreover, in calculating the LRAIC for water, no account has been taken of the potential power benefits that&#13;
would be recoverable and would offset the costs allocated to water. In the case of the future sources under&#13;
consideration, these power benefits have been estimated by EAAB's consultants at more than 50% of the&#13;
investment costs.&#13;

Colombia&#13;
Santafe I Water Supply And Sewerage Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Annex 10 Financial Evaluation: Assumptions &amp; Results&#13;
A.    General.&#13;
1.    Base Case Scenario: The financial analysis of EAAB performance over the next decade has been&#13;
carried out on the assumption that the entire Santafe I project will be financed in two phases, the first phase&#13;
Bank loan for US$ 145 million as proposed, and the second phase loan for a propsoed US$ 105 million&#13;
provided EAAB performance meets the targets and finacial indaicators discussed in Annex 14 (Action&#13;
Plan). The base case scenario under which the present financial analysis has been carried out, assumes that&#13;
EAAB will be able to effect tariff increase in real terms (both globally and in terms of structure changes)&#13;
equivalent to 3% in 1996, and 2.5% each in 1996 and 1997. As this is the period of the mandate of the&#13;
present Mayoral administration, tariff increases and structural changes that will be needed in future years&#13;
to meet necessary investments and capacity increases in water and sewerage and waste water treatment&#13;
have not been explicitly assumed for the base case. The base case assumes that EAAB will be able to&#13;
achieve at least the minimum targets specified for UFW reduction and bill collection efficiency, ie. UFW&#13;
decreasing from the estimated 39.7% in 1994 to 29.5% by the year 2000. This target has been considered&#13;
to be more realistic and achievable than the UFW target specified in the PP, which assumes a drop to 20%&#13;
by the year 2000. At the same time, the bill collection efficiency is assumed to increase from an estimated&#13;
80% in 1994 to 92% by 2000, a target that is considered feasible and achievable. The improvements&#13;
observed during the latter half of 1994, coupled with the introduction of proven commercial and financial&#13;
accounting systems provide grounds for this assumption. The tariff increases assumed to be effected under&#13;
the base case scenario are suffiecient to enable EAAB to meet the covenanted working ratio and quick ratio&#13;
targets. A sensitivity analysis of the robustness of EAAB's present fianncial situation and projected&#13;
financial performance under varying levels of performance improvements has been carried and is described&#13;
in para. 25 below. The base case scenario also incorporates the agreed terms of the first phase Bank loan&#13;
(ie, 60% of the loan as a single currency fixed rate loan, and 40% as a single currency floating rate loan).&#13;
The second phase loan is also assume to be effected on the same basis as the first.&#13;
2.     Inflation Rates. The following inflation rates (%/o) were used, based on agreed economic&#13;
parameters between the Government of Colombia and the World Bank, and consistent with the Bank's&#13;
guidelines on Expected Price Increases and Interest Rates dated October 1994.&#13;

3.    Interest Rates. The following interest rates (%) were used based on the official Government&#13;
estimates of the Colombian short term interest rate movements and on the Bank's guidelines on expected&#13;
changes in the 6-month LIBOR rates:&#13;

4.     Exchange Rates. Exchange rates assumed are the official Government projections as of October&#13;
1994.&#13;

Year-end           831    946   1061   1171   1271   1354    1428    1507&#13;
B.    Income Statements:&#13;
5.     Water demand has been estimated to grow at a rate of 0.5m3/sec per year from the prevailing&#13;
level of 17m3/sec. At that rate, EAAB would reach the end of its presently deliverable flow rate of&#13;
25m3/sec by the year 2010. The EAAB Action Plan expects to establish 48,000 new connections per year&#13;
(about 3% of existing customers) . The projections also include EAAB's program of elimination of an&#13;
estimated 200,000 illegal connections over a seven-year period. Despite the optimism of the PP, the base&#13;
case financial projections take a more conservative view of reductions in unaccounted-for water (UFW),&#13;
and only show a decline from about 40% in 1994 to about 30% by 2000, reaching a level of 26% by the&#13;
end of the project in 2003. This matches the forecast assumptions in the economic analysis.&#13;
6.     Revenue from water and sewerage services. EAAB has been authorized (Resolution of January&#13;
1993) to increase its rates, until December 31, 1993, to its customers by 1.8% per month (23.8%&#13;
annually) except for municipalities, for which the increase amounts to 2.40% per month (32.92%&#13;
annually) up to a certain amount of water consumed which differs by municipality, after which the tariffs&#13;
will be increased to an amount which will cover production costs. EAAB was authorized to increase the&#13;
sewerage charge for industries (about 3,600 customers) from 50% to 60% of the water bill and for&#13;
polluting industries (estimated about 1,200 customers) from 50% to 100% effective September 1, 1993. At&#13;
the end of 1993, EAAB was authorized to effect tariff increases of 1.89/o/month (23.8% annually) from&#13;
January 1, 1994 on all classes of customers. In 1995, the monthly increase was set at 1.5% (annual&#13;
inflation rate of 18%). Thereafter, it was assumed that rates would be adjusted by at least the inflation&#13;
rate. Increases in tariffs in real terms were calculated on the base model to ensure compliance with the&#13;
objectives of the financial covenants on working ratio and the quick ratio targets. At the same time, the&#13;
target tariff increases were designed to substantially reduce the negative net cash flows in the two critical&#13;
years of the project implementation (1997 and 1998) when heavy investment outflows would overly tax&#13;
EAAB's financial position, and to ensure the maintenance of a quick ratio of at least 1.1 in all the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102-&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
projection years. This analysis gave projected tariff increases of 3% in 1996 and 2.5% in each of the years&#13;
1997 and 1998, to meet the working ratio targets of not more than 45% in each of the years 1996, 1997&#13;
and 1998, and not more than 40% in each year thereafter and a quick ratio target of at least 1.0 in 1997 and&#13;
1998, and of 1. i in each year thereafter. 6Table I shows the projected financial results including the&#13;
assumption of the tariff increases in real terms. The proposed increases in real terms are considered to be&#13;
acceptable in view of the improvements in service quality and in the reliability of the water system. The&#13;
proposed tariff study would determine the manner in which the tariff increases in real terms will be&#13;
achieved, through a combination of structural adjustments and through absolute increases in the tariff&#13;
levels themselves. The tariff rates and structure will meet the criteria set forth in the Public Service Law&#13;
and ensure that the subsidization would be strictly limited to the levels specified ie. 50% for the lowest&#13;
economic strata, 40 % for the next level and 15% for the next level). In accordance with the provisions of&#13;
the Public Services Law, such subsidies should be explicitly provided by the Municipality; however, for&#13;
the purposes of the project analysis, no subsidy transfers were assumed to take place in the base case. This&#13;
was to ensure that EAAB's financial condition would remain robust under the most conservative&#13;
assumptions.&#13;
7.     Other revenue includes sale of unproductive assets estimated at Col$ 3,000 million in 1993 and&#13;
Col$ 1,500 million in 1994. Beyond that period, a small amount of other revenue based on the figure for&#13;
1993 were maintained in constant terms.&#13;
8.    Fondo Ambiental Charges represent surcharges on polluting industries and businesses that are&#13;
collected by EAAB and transferred to the CAR annually. They are estimated at US$2.0 million in 1994&#13;
terms. As these collections are not part of EAAB's operating revenues, they are shown below the line and&#13;
flow through the Funds Flow Statement as transfers to CAR.&#13;
9.     Monetary Corrections are the net value of changes in the non-monetary accounts due to the&#13;
change in the monetary unit of value, i.e. the Colombian Peso adjusted for the annual certified rate of&#13;
change in the Index of Domestic Inflation. These changes affect the following accounts:&#13;
Inventories: The value of the inventories is adjusted for changes in the monetary base at the end of&#13;
each year.&#13;
Long Term Debt: The net value of foreign-denominated long term debt is adjusted and the&#13;
adjustment carried through into the monetary correction.&#13;
6  Workine Ratio defined as Ratio of working expenses, prior to depreciation and interest charges, and including annual&#13;
payments to existing pensioners, payments into the EAAB Pension Fund, and annual transfers to external pension funds&#13;
under Law 100 to operating revenues prior to subsidy transfers and extraordinary income (including income from excess&#13;
liquidity balances)&#13;
Ouick Ratio defined as the ratio of liquid assets (cash and bank balances and short-term investments readily convertible&#13;
to cash in three months) and 30% of accounts receivable to current liabilities due and payable within one year, including&#13;
loan amortizations due and payable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103-&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
10.    Connection charges. EAAB charges new customers the cost of the connection at the average rate&#13;
of Col$ 150,000. The rate was kept constant in real terms.&#13;
11.    Energy consumption was separated into the three main treatment plant components, i.e., Wiesner,&#13;
Tibito and other, to account for the different levels of power consumption. From 1994 as through 1997,&#13;
capacity utilization of the Tibito plant will increase as the increasing water demand will need to be&#13;
primarily met from the unused capacity at Tibito. There is a possibility that from 1998, Tibito may be&#13;
operated as a private concession. However, the base model does not take this possibility into account.&#13;
12.    Chemicals were estimated as a function of production and the unit price of chemicals was&#13;
escalated at the above inflation rates.&#13;
13.    Administration expenses for 1994 were taken from the 1994 budget and inflated thereafter. The&#13;
large escalation of 1994 with respect to 1993 is explained by the expansion of some expenses (e.g.,&#13;
insurance) from depressed to normal levels as a result of the solution of EAAB's financial crisis in 1993&#13;
and 1994.&#13;
14.    Repairs and Maintenance is broken down between civil works (80%) and electromecanical&#13;
equipment (20%). Civil works will gradually increase the amount ofthis cost item from 0.5% oftotal&#13;
gross fixed assets in 1994 to 1% in 1998. Electromechanical equipment will increase from 1% of gross&#13;
fixed assets in 1994 to 3% in 1998.&#13;
15.    Write Offs represent the value of fixed assets written off as the rehabilitation program is&#13;
implemented. The residual value of the Tibito plant and the Tibito pipelines are also written off as the&#13;
corresponding improvements/reconstruction are completed.&#13;
16.    New investment module as of year 2002. We assume that a second Sante Fe project will start in&#13;
2002. It will have exactly the same profile as the Santa Fe I project, which entails: the same amount of&#13;
capital expenditures (in 1993$) distributed through the years 2002-2005 as the Santa Fe I was distributed&#13;
through 1994-2001. This project will be financed with intemal cash generation, which will be&#13;
accumulating in adequate amounts to face this financial burden. In addition to the above, the model&#13;
incorporates investments in development of proposed new water sources starting in 1997, to enable EAAB&#13;
to meet the projected demand in the years after 2003. EAAB's consultants have estimated the optimum&#13;
sequencing of the investments and this has been incorporated in the model. The financing is assumed to&#13;
come from a mixture of debt and EAAB's own cash generation. The benefits of the potential hydro-power&#13;
generation implicit in the source development program could provide an additional means of funding the&#13;
needed investment costs. However, for the purposes of the analysis, such potential benefits and possible&#13;
financing support was ignored. Other investments include annual renewals at around 5% of the gross fixed&#13;
asset values.&#13;
17.   Personnel. In 1994, EAAB reduced staff size to 2500. It is expected that this will decline further&#13;
to 2400 in 1996 and remain at that level thereafter. Average salaries were inflated at the local inflation rate&#13;
starting in 1994.&#13;

ANNEX 10&#13;
C.    Flow of Funds &amp; Balance Sheet&#13;
18.    The 1993 Balance sheet figures were taken from the audited results. The 1994 figures are&#13;
unaudited.&#13;
19.   Fixed assets. The Santafe I investment program described in Annex 7 and estimated in Annex 8&#13;
was taken as the basis for the projections. Under its new status as a government-owned industrial and&#13;
commercial entity, EAAB is authorized (Decrees 2077, 2075, 2911 and 29112) to revalue monthly its&#13;
fixed assets and inventories using the Colombian consumer price index. The 1993 audit has effected&#13;
corrections in EAAB's revaluation methodology to meet the Colombian regulations in this regard. The&#13;
1994 figures show some minor adjustments in this regard.&#13;
20.    The fixed assets were adjusted for inflation as follows;&#13;
* fixed assets in operation: the balance at the beginning of the year was revalued according to&#13;
the full annual local inflation rate and the additions at one-half the annual local inflation rate:&#13;
* construction in progress was revalued as fixed assets in operation; additions and&#13;
capitalizations were revalued at one-half the annual local inflation rate;&#13;
* depreciation: the balance at the beginning of the year was revalued according to the full&#13;
annual local inflation rate; the annual depreciation charge was calculated at the average&#13;
depreciation rate of 3% applied to the revalued gross fixed assets in operation at the end of the&#13;
year; the annual depreciation charge was not revalued.&#13;
21.    Pension Liabilities and Related Issues: As of December 31, 1994, EAAB had an actuarially&#13;
estimated unfunded liability on account of its employees' retirement plan amounting to Col$ 360 million&#13;
(about US$ 420 million). In accordance with its PP, EAAB is obliged to set up a Pension Fund to cover&#13;
the pension payments to all future retirees who do not opt for coverage under Colombia's new Social&#13;
Security Law (Law 100), but instead stay on under the existing union agreement. The existing retirees&#13;
could also be paid out of such a Pension Fund. As part of the Performance Plan agreement with the&#13;
National Government, EAAB has already established the Employee Pension Fund in 1994. During 1995,&#13;
EAAB will make other mandated changes in its treatment of future pensioners to comply with the recently&#13;
enacted Colombian law on Social Security ( Law 100 of 1993). EAAB will continue to service pensions to&#13;
its existing pool of pensioners (approximately 1250) directly out of its annual operating revenues and use&#13;
the revenues accruing in its Employee Pension Fund to partially offset use of its cash flow for this purpose.&#13;
EAAB will need to continue its present practice of using its annual cash flow to cover the pension payment&#13;
obligations. At the same time, if there are excess cash reserves due to improved bill collection, favorable&#13;
investment retums on excess cash balances and other extraordinary events, EAAB will continue to increase&#13;
the corpus of the Employee Pension Fund in order to provide an additional source of supplementary cash&#13;
flow to cover its pension payment obligations in particular years. EAAB will begin to contribute its share&#13;
of social security and medical fund contributions to the State Social Security scheme (or to altemative&#13;
private pension funds that are authorized to receive such contributions on the basis of individual employee&#13;
elections under provisions of the Social Security Law). EAAB will also become liable to transfer the entire&#13;
actuarial liability balances including accrued interest charges to the State Social Security Scheme or to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105-&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
authorized alternatives when employees retire after December 31, 1995. As these liabilities are currently&#13;
unfunded (and only partially provisioned), EAAB will need to use its cash flow to effect these transfers.&#13;
The forecast financial statements reflect the provisions as outlined above, and take into account the&#13;
increased cash outflows that will be required. EAAB's pension liability will be fully provisioned within&#13;
seven years as required by new Colombian accounting rules. The cash flow arising from the annual&#13;
provisioning will more than amply cover EAAB's cash requirements to meet the present and future pension&#13;
payment obligations. As EAAB's pension liabilities remain largely unfunded, it is essential that water and&#13;
sewerage rates cover the annual cash flow requirements in this regard. The definition of the working ratio&#13;
therefore includes this requirement to ensure that tariff increases provide the adequate cash flow to EAAB&#13;
to meet these essential needs. The balance in the Pension Reserves is net of annual amortizations of&#13;
accrued pension liabilities due to pensioners leaving EAAB's pension plan , additions and reductions in&#13;
numbers of pensioners and estimated actuarial liabilities outstanding at each year end.&#13;
22.    Other Long Term Assets include the long term, portion of the amounts due from the EEB in&#13;
respect of its share of the financing of the Chingaza project, the short term portion being included in the&#13;
value of other receivables (see para 21 below). This rubrique also includes the long term portion of&#13;
employee loans for housing.&#13;
23.    Current assets were estimated as follows:&#13;
*  Cash balances were estimated at 15 days each of cash operating expenses and investment&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
- Receivables were calculated separately for government (central and District) and non-&#13;
government. The December 31, 1994 receivables from government and non-government of 77&#13;
days of annual billings were adjusted each year to comply with the Action Plan targets. The&#13;
receivables include the estimated billings for the last two months of each year, which are sent&#13;
for collection in January of the following year.&#13;
-  Other receivables comprise mainly (approximately 70% of the amount) payments due from&#13;
the Electric Supply Company of Bogota (EEB) on account of its contribution to the financing&#13;
of the Chingaza project. The current portion of the long term obligations due from EEB are&#13;
included under this category. In addition, non-trading receivables from other entities and from&#13;
employees real estate loan payments due within one year are included. The amount of the&#13;
other receivables is projected to increase at the inflation rate.&#13;
*  Inventories were calculated at 3 months of consumption of chemical products. Annual&#13;
adjustments of inventory values in line with inflation were made to comply with the Colombian&#13;
accounting regulations.&#13;
*  Other current assets comprise the net value of amounts due from or owed to other entities on&#13;
account of transfers of staff and their corresponding pension benefits, as well as the short term&#13;
portion of the monetary value of accumulated leave benefits (Cesantias). From 1995, they&#13;
also include the anticipated payments due from the District Government under Ley 60 transfers&#13;
for the funding of the Santafe I program. The amounts shown in the financing plan are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106-&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
expected to be paid in installments, and the unpaid installments at the end of each year&#13;
(estimated at 25% of the total amounts due each year) are included in the figure shown under&#13;
this rubrique.&#13;
24.    Current liabilities were estimated as follows:&#13;
*  Suppliers. The estimated balance of Col$ 33,207 million as of December 31, 1994, was&#13;
separated into its component and projects as follows:&#13;
*  Col$ 15,367 million due on account of payments to EAAB was adjusted for the level of power&#13;
consumption annually, and maintained at approximately three months of payments due.&#13;
* Col$ 16,399 million accrued interest was projected at 3 months of annual interest charges.&#13;
*  Col$ 1,441 million due to normal operations were projected at 2 months of cash operating&#13;
expenses excluding salaries.&#13;
*  Contractors were calculated at 2 months of investment expenditures.&#13;
*  Other payables. The balance at December 31, 1994, was increased by the inflation rate.&#13;
*  Current Portion of L-T Liabilities. These include the current portion of long-tern debt as&#13;
well as the current portion of EAAB liabilities to Employee benefits, mainly the termination&#13;
and accrued leave benefits (Cesantias) which are projected to increase in line with inflation and&#13;
adjusted for the size of the labor pool.&#13;
25.    Long-term debt: The financing and amortization of debt are calculated in the model in line with&#13;
amortization tables furnished by EAAB.&#13;
26.    The Projected Flow of Funds and Balance Sheets are shown as tables 2 and 3 respectively. The&#13;
Working capital table is shown as Table 4.&#13;
27.    Table 5 shows a set of indicators and ratios of financial performance including the current and&#13;
working ratios, debt-service coverage and indicators of personnel expenses, financing mix and revenue&#13;
parameters.&#13;
D.    Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
28.    A sensitivity analysis has been carried out under various scenarios of performance improvement&#13;
and of failure to achieve the forecast levels of operating performance. The primary objective of the&#13;
sensitivity analysis was to demonstrate the basic robustness of EAAB's financial situation following the&#13;
financial restructuring and bailout implemented by the National Government in 1993 and following&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 107-&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
EAAB's organizational transformation carried out in the past year. While, further organizational and&#13;
managerial improvements are needed to sustain the reform effort, the sensitivity shows that even under&#13;
unlikely scenarios of failure to achieve even a modicum of improvement in its operational performance and&#13;
of failure to enact tariff changes, EAAB's financial situation is weakened but nonetheless sufficiently&#13;
robust for the purposes of implementing the Santafe project as defined. Action of future investments in&#13;
water source development and on expansion of the system beyond the completion of the Santafe I project&#13;
may need to be postponed in the event of continuing non-compliance with the forecast levels of&#13;
performance. However, for the present, EAAB's financial situation is sufficiently robust to withstand a&#13;
prolonged period of insufficient cash flow from operations. In the worst case scenario, it is also assumed&#13;
that the proposed second phase Bank loan will not matenralise. EAAB, even under such a scenario will be&#13;
able to complete the various planned investments under the Santafe I project. The results of the sensitivity&#13;
test are summarized in Table 6. While tariff increases are critical to achieving the covenanted financial&#13;
ratios, the sensitivity of EAAB's cash flow and its consequent ability to meet the investmnent requiremnents&#13;
of the Santafe I project is low, because of EAAB's exceptionally advantageous cash position prior to start&#13;
of implementation of the Santafe I project.&#13;

Santafe I Water Supply And Sewerage Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Annex 11 Water &amp; Sewerage Tariff Structure and Issues&#13;
I.     TARIFF STRUCTURE&#13;
1.    The tariff rates and structure for water and sewerage services in Colombia are based on the&#13;
principle of cross subsidization to allow the provision of basic services at affordable prices to the poor.&#13;
For this purpose, customers are classified as residential, mixed (residential and commercial use),&#13;
commercial, industrial, and official users. Prior to the institutional changes that occurred in 1991 (see&#13;
Chapter 1), tariff rates and structure were approved by the National Tariff Board (Junta Nacional de&#13;
Tarifas). Now the newly established Regulatory Commission is empowered to carry out this function.&#13;
EAAB also provides bulk water to some neighboring municipalities. Commercial and industrial users&#13;
heavily subsidize the residential users and bulk water sales. The average combined water and sewerage&#13;
residential tariff for 1993, including fixed charges, was Col.$ 225/cubic meter (about US$ 0.29/m3). On&#13;
the other hand, average tariffs for commercial and industrial users were Col$ 560 and 620 respectively.&#13;
The overall average tariff was Col.$ 340 per cubic meter (US$ 0.43/m3) which is below the estimated&#13;
Average Incremental Cost (AIC) of Col.$ 434 per cubic meter (US$ 0.55/m3) of services without&#13;
including the proposed investments in Santafe I.&#13;
2.     The residential tariff has six levels or strata, based on the perceived cost and location of the house&#13;
according to the classification of the residential district. The stratification is based on the perception of the&#13;
socio-economic capacity of specific areas as defined by the local authorities of the capital district. The&#13;
poorest class would be classified in stratum number one and the wealthiest in stratum number six. The&#13;
stratification system has had many flaws as it lacks transparency and the classification of certain areas has&#13;
been influenced by political considerations. Residential consumers face a minimum monthly charge for a&#13;
minimum consumption level (20 m3), which varies by a factor of 100 from the lowest to the highest income&#13;
groups, plus a variable tariff based on actual consumption and stratum. Connection charges, including&#13;
metering, are based on the diameter of the house connection and the stratum.&#13;

A.    Tariff Structure Characteristics and Needed Changes&#13;
4.    The main characteristic of EAAB's residential tariff structure is a disproportionately high fixed&#13;
charge (which accounts for 40% of operating revenues), large consumption ranges, a high minimnum&#13;
consumption allowance and lack of progressivity for high consumption through the fixed charge. The tariff&#13;
structure lacks appropriate balance among major categories of consumers; high fixed charges discourage&#13;
water conservation as large consumers observe in practice a reduction in the average cost per cubic meter&#13;
as consumption increases. There are two steps that EAAB needs to take with respect to changing the tariff&#13;
structure in the near-terrn. The first would be to eliminate the three-tier structure and have a simpler two-&#13;
tier structure with a minimum cut-off of around 20-25 m3, and charge all remaining consumption at a&#13;
single higher tariff. This would enable EAAB to increase revenues by a substantial amount without&#13;
adjusting the level of tariffs themselves. The second step would be to increase the average tariff through&#13;
the volumetric portion of the structure without increasing the fixed fee component. This could be done&#13;
while still retaining the relative progression of tariffs across the strata This would encourage greater water&#13;
conservation and would still permit the lifeline consumption for lower strata.&#13;

5.     Table 2 shows details of the analysis of tariffs, subsidies and costs across the different classes of&#13;
consumers and details the progression over the forecast period. The main conclusions from this analysis&#13;
are as follows:&#13;
*  In general, all Bogota users pay approximately 12% lower than the average incremental costs&#13;
of providing the services;&#13;
* service to the surrounding municipalities is heavily subsidized, and EAAB has now begun a&#13;
program to adjust the tariffs rapidly to the levels prevailing in Bogoti. However, even with the&#13;
adjustments that have been agreed with the municipalities concerned, it will take several years&#13;
until the end of this decade to achieve some parity with the Bogoti tariff levels;&#13;
*  Industrial and commercial consumers pay substantially higher tariffs than do the residential&#13;
customers, over twice the average incremental costs at the prevailing tariff levels.&#13;
*  Customers in the three lowest strata account for about 50% of consumption while representing&#13;
63% of the accounts in 1993. These proportions are as the newer accounts are being generated&#13;
primarily in the lower strata. For example, by the end of the decade, in the year 2000, the&#13;
three lowest strata would represent 70% of the accounts in Bogoti and would consume 56% of&#13;
the water sold.&#13;
* The three lowest strata will continue to remain heavily subsidized;&#13;
*  The other strata will continue to pay average rates between 15-60% higher than the average&#13;
incremental costs.&#13;
6.     EAAB is aware of the shortcomings of the present structure, particularly as the need for&#13;
substantial new investments becomes acute. Consequently, EAAB is preparing to carry out a detailed&#13;
tariff study with the objective of determining and putting in place a new tariff structure to achieve a well&#13;
designed tariff that will satisfy the financial needs of EAAB with an average tariff at least equal to the AIC,&#13;
discourage waste, establish a well balanced cross-subsidy to protect the poorer residential users, have&#13;
equity for the commercial and industrial users and further arrest the subsidy to municipalities through the&#13;
sale of bulk water. The tariff study, terms of reference for which have already been reviewed by the Bank,&#13;
will commence shortly, in order to produce a suitable set of recommended actions by the end of 1995. As&#13;
discussed in the main text, agreement was obtained at negotiations on the implementation of the study and&#13;
on EAAB and the government ensuring that a new structure and level of tariffs will be in place by 1996.&#13;

            Colombia - First Santa Fe Water Supply and
            Sewerage Rehabilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The key objective of the First Santa Fe
            Water Supply &amp; Sewerage Rehabilitation Project is to
            support and consolidate the transition of Empresa de
            Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Bogota (EAAB) from a
            technically capable but operationally inefficient public
            service agency to a commercially-run public utility company,
            sensitive to the demands of the market, and with a corporate
            culture based on professional responsibility and
            accountability. The project will enhance operational
            efficiency, provide broader managerial autonomy and
            responsibility, reduce political interference, and increase
            public accountability of municipal utilities such as EAAB.
            The transition to a corporate culture will prepare the way
            for a longer-term structural transformation of the company,
            including inter alia, participation of private sector
            capital in the future provision and operation of the
            capital's water and sewerage services. In addition, the
            project has a number of specific objectives which include:
            1) expanding distribution services to the urban poor; 2)
            addressing major environmental concerns of the heavily
            polluted Bogota River; 3) reducing the vulnerability of the
            Bogota water supply system; 4) supporting a revamped economy
            and its tariff framework which enables EAAB to reflect the
            full cost of providing its services. The project includes
            eight main components: 1) vulnerability control; 2) primary
            sanitary and storm water drainage and pollution control; 3)
            primary water distribution system; 4) secondary water,
            sewerage and drainage networks and service connections; 5)
            rehabilitation works; 6) institutional strengthening of
            EAAB; 7) technical assistance and consulting services for
            engineering, design and supervision of works; and 8)
            environmental component.
