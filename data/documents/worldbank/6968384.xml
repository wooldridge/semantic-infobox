A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE&#13;
&#13;
  1. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The continuing outbreaks o f highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in recent years have&#13;
caused substantial damage to the poultry industry in several regions o f the world, resulted inthe&#13;
loss o f human life, and raised concerns about a possible human pandemic.'                              Large scale&#13;
outbreaks began in 2003 in several Southeast Asian countries, and HPAI has now reached&#13;
Europe, the Middle East, and West Africa.&#13;
&#13;
Between 2003 and April 4, 2006, 191laboratory-confirmed human cases o f infection with HPAI&#13;
(hereafter, Avian and Human Influenza, or AHI) have been diagnosed, and 108 o f these died.&#13;
Nearly all o f the confirmed cases are known to have had contact with birds, and so far AH1does&#13;
not transmit easily from human-to-human. However, as the disease spreads there i s a concern&#13;
that the virus may acquire the characteristics which would enable efficient human-to-human&#13;
transmission.2       Each additional human case gives the virus an opportunity to improve its&#13;
transmissibility in humans, and thus develop into a pandemic strain. The recent spread o f the&#13;
virus to poultry and wild birds in new areas further broadens opportunities for human cases to&#13;
occur. While neither the timing nor the severity o f the next pandemic can be predicted, the&#13;
probability that a pandemic will occur has increased. Ifthe virus achieves high transmissibility&#13;
between humans and is highlypathogenic, then a severe human pandemic could result with very&#13;
large losses o f human life and enormous economic disruptions and losses on a global scale.&#13;
&#13;
The global response to the threat o f AH1inhumans and domestic poultry, guided by the global&#13;
strategies put forward by World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture&#13;
Organization (FAO), and World Organization for Animal Health (OiE), comprises four key&#13;
strategies: (i)  progressively controlling and eradicating the spread o f the disease in animals, thus&#13;
lowering the animal-origin virus load in the environment and reducing the risks o f human&#13;
infection; (ii)  preventing and limiting the spread o f the disease among humans, thereby reducing&#13;
the opportunity for the virus to improve its human transmissibility; (iii)                       in the event o f a&#13;
pandemic, helping affected populations cope with its effects; and (iv) minimize the social and&#13;
economic impact from the threat of AHI. AH1prevention and control involves many players in&#13;
the areas o f health, agriculture, natural disaster response, finance and planning, and a&#13;
multisectoral approach i s therefore essential. It is also recognized that individual countries are&#13;
&#13;
 'Avian influenza, or "bird flu", i s a contagious disease o f animals caused by viruses that normally infect only birds&#13;
and, less commonly, pigs. Avian influenza viruses are highly species-specific, but have, on rare occasions, crossed&#13;
the species barrier to infect humans. In domestic poultry, infection with avian influenza viruses causes two main&#13;
forms o f disease, distinguished by low and highextremes o f virulence. The l o w pathogenic form commonly causes&#13;
only mild symptoms and may easily go undetected. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) form spreads&#13;
very rapidly through poultry flocks, causes disease affecting multiple internal organs, and has a mortality that can&#13;
approach loo%, often within 48 hours. H5N1 is one strain o f the H P A I virus.&#13;
&#13;
  The virus can improve its transmissibility among humans via two principal mechanisms. The first is re-assortment&#13;
in which genetic material is exchanged between human and avian viruses during co-infection o f a human or pig.&#13;
The second mechanism i s a more gradual process of adaptive mutation, whereby the capability o f the virus to bind&#13;
to human cells increases during subsequent infections o f humans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
central to a coordinated and effective global response. Country strategies should be developed in&#13;
accordance with country-specific needs and circumstances, and the strategies should be owned&#13;
bythe individual governments facing the threat o fAHI.&#13;
&#13;
Regional Dimensions. InEast Asia and the Pacific, cases o f AH1have occurred in a number of&#13;
countries, including Cambodia, China, Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Indonesia,&#13;
Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.             Responses to the outbreaks in&#13;
domestic and wild fowl have included screening, surveillance, and precautions at the borders,&#13;
controlling movement inside the country, culling programs, and control o f wildlife reservoirs.&#13;
Several countries have already developed integrated regional plans. Specific strategies vary&#13;
across countries, especially regarding issues such as the appropriateness o f mass vaccination o f&#13;
poultry.    Clearly the cross-country issues in dealing with AH1 are critical in terms o f&#13;
transmission, information sharing, as well as coordination. The country specific strategies have&#13;
been adapted to the specific conditions in-country.      In addition, Lao PDR participates in a&#13;
number o f regional initiatives through ASEAN, APEC, Mekong Basin Surveillance, among&#13;
others.&#13;
&#13;
Thenational dimension. The last confirmed outbreak o f HPAIinLao PDR was inMarch2004,&#13;
and in February 2006 the virus was detected in a duck in Vientiane Province; while there have&#13;
been no other confirmed reports, there is speculation that other outbreaks may have occurred,&#13;
and it is thought possible that there may also have been human cases which were not reported or&#13;
investigated. Lao PDR i s a land-locked country that shares borders with countries affected by&#13;
outbreaks caused by H5N1 (alternatively referred to as HPAI), specifically Vietnam, Thailand,&#13;
Cambodia, and China. These borders are largely permeable, where crossing o f food products,&#13;
animals, and people occur. Although the population o f Lao PDR is not large, 5.6 million, the&#13;
majority o f these people live in rural and remote mountainous areas, with the attendant&#13;
challenges o f communications, transport, and service provision.           The population is also&#13;
ethnically diverse:   49 distinct ethnic groups speak different languages, and have different&#13;
cultures. With a per capita income in 2005 of US$380, Lao PDR i s classed among the Least&#13;
Developed Countries.&#13;
&#13;
There are approximately 20 million poultry in Lao PDR o f which, 20 percent i s owned by&#13;
approximately 120 commercial enterprises that serve the larger urban populations in Vientiane,&#13;
Luang Prabang, Champasak, and Savanakhet. The remaining 80 percent is owned by subsistence&#13;
fanners for family consumption. The FA0 has been providing support to the National Animal&#13;
Health Center (NAHC) in Vientiane the national laboratory, which has limited surveillance due&#13;
to capacity at the laboratory, and also suffers from a shortage o fveterinarians.&#13;
&#13;
Health expenditures, at $12 per capita, are among the lowest in Asia, and the sector i s&#13;
characterized by insufficient health workers, essential drugs, and equipment. Most hospitals&#13;
have insufficient isolation rooms and equipment for patients with severe respiratory diseases.&#13;
The constraints in the health sector are mirrored in the National Center for Laboratory and&#13;
Epidemiology (NCLE), which also lacks sufficient human and financial resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Inresponse to the situation, the Government of Lao PDR has prepared an integrated National&#13;
Avian Influenza Control and Pandemic Preparedness Plan (the National Plan) covering the&#13;
period 2006-2010. The National Plan i s fully consistent with, and draws heavily on, the global&#13;
strategies developed by FAO/OiE and WHO, and provides the basis for the program which the&#13;
World Bank and other donors will support.&#13;
&#13;
 2.   Country and Sector Issues&#13;
&#13;
The first and only wave o f avian influenza (H5N1) outbreaks in the poultry population was&#13;
reported in early 2004: a total o f 45 incidents were reported from mid-January to the end o f&#13;
March 2004. It is suspected, however, that more outbreaks may have occurred inrural areas, but&#13;
were either undetected or unreported. In May 2006, the Government confirmed that a duck&#13;
sampled in February in Vientiane tested positive for the virus. To date, no human cases have&#13;
been reported but it is possible that non-reporting i s the result o f failure to detect or document&#13;
(details o f the health and animal health sectors are provided inAppendix 1). The Government's&#13;
rapid and appropriate response to the 2004 outbreak i s likely to have contributed to forestalling a&#13;
much larger and sustained outbreak. Underthe Global Program for Avian Influenza Control and&#13;
Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI), Lao PDR i s characterized as an endemic&#13;
country (page 44). Inline with the eligibility criteria inthe GPAI, the Government has prepared&#13;
and i s implementing an HPAI Control Strategy in collaboration with UN technical agencies.&#13;
This national plan has five strategies: (i)    development o f a disease free avian management&#13;
system; (ii)  disease surveillance and response in humans during outbreaks; (iii)     laboratory and&#13;
curative care; (iv) health education and community action; and (v) strengthening o f institutional&#13;
and legal frameworks. Each activity under the National Plan has been classified according to its&#13;
priority level and whether it i s to be undertaken inthe short- or medium-term. Current financing&#13;
sources and indicative resource gaps have also been identified. Every activity receiving support&#13;
under this program has been rated as "high priority" and is not receiving support from other&#13;
donors or agencies.&#13;
&#13;
 3. Rationale for World Bank involvement&#13;
&#13;
A key justification for the World Bank's involvement is the global public goods aspect o f&#13;
controlling H P A I - one o f many emerging and re-emerging zoonoses. There is also a national&#13;
public goods perspective for countries to strengthen their veterinary services, disease&#13;
surveillance, and human health system as planned in this operation. The social and economic&#13;
impacts o f the threat o f AH1are extensive. HPAI control programs require a multi-disciplinary&#13;
approach to integrate the technical, social, economic, political, policy, and regulatory issues that&#13;
must be addressed in a coordinated response. The technical assistance provided by the World&#13;
Bank has been important in similar global or regional emergency situations such as SARS, and&#13;
post-disaster reconstruction.      The World Bank has a comparative advantage in providing&#13;
integrator skills and multi-sectoral perspectives and in addressing the institutional dimensions o f&#13;
the response to such emergencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The World Bank has been working closely with WHO, FAO, OiE, multilateral, bilateral, and&#13;
other partners at both the country and international levels to prepare the GPAI. InLao PDR, the&#13;
World Bank has been working with UNDP (the convener o f the donor round table), and other&#13;
partners to help the Government assess and improve its National Plan, and continues to review&#13;
with Government the range of activities that require financing. The World Bank is also in a&#13;
position to assist Lao PDR in leveraging additional resources from other bilateral and&#13;
international agencies.&#13;
&#13;
 4. Country eligibility under GPAI&#13;
&#13;
The proposed project falls under the GPAI, approved by the Bank's Board o f Directors on&#13;
January 16, 2006. GPAI support i s to be provided usingthe horizontal Adaptable Program Loan&#13;
(APL)instrument andwithina globalcoordinationframework. Under the global APL, individual&#13;
countries may obtain separate loans, credits and grants, as they become available, to finance their&#13;
own national projects, up to the global aggregate limit o f US$500 million. Since the GPAI i s&#13;
designed to provide emergency financing to participating countries to contain outbreaks o f avian&#13;
flu through early detection and rapid response measures, the country specific operations will be&#13;
processed under the Bank's emergency policy OP/BP 8.50. The GPAI will treat specific&#13;
emergency response projects in each country as "phases" o f a horizontal APL (similar&#13;
approaches include the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Programs for the African and Caribbean&#13;
Regions). Lao PDR clearly meets the eligibility criteria specified in the GPAI document, given&#13;
that: (i)it i s a country in "endemic situation" (with outbreaks in poultry, but no human&#13;
infection); (ii) Government has prepared and is implementing an HPAI Control Strategy in&#13;
                the&#13;
collaboration with UN technical agencies; and (iii) activities included under this proposed&#13;
                                                       the&#13;
Project are fully consistent with the provisions o f GPAI.&#13;
&#13;
B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
1. Project development objective and key indicators&#13;
&#13;
As indicatedabove, Lao PDR's National Planhas five strategies, and forms the basis for support&#13;
being provided by the various development partners. Resources being provided by the World&#13;
Bank (comprising an IDA grant, PHRD grant, and funds from the Avian and Human Influenza&#13;
Facility (AHIF)) will be used to finance (within the available funds) the critical, short-term and&#13;
long-term activities that are currently not being financed from other sources. The World Bank&#13;
support will be flexible due to the uncertainties surrounding the further spread o f AH1 and to&#13;
ensure that, when other financiers provide support, the World Bank funding can be used to fill&#13;
the gaps that remain.&#13;
&#13;
The overall development objective o f the proposed World Bank financing is to support the&#13;
Government's National Plan, which aims to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry&#13;
sector by AH1infection and other zoonoses inLao PDR, and to prepare for, control, and respond&#13;
to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans. The key indicator&#13;
will be the percent o f districts that remain free o f confirmed HPAI infection in the poultry&#13;
sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. Financinginstrumentand projectcomponents&#13;
&#13;
Funding provided by the World Bank, other donors and technical agencies, denoted as total&#13;
below, will support the implementation o f the National Plan. Financing from the World Bank&#13;
will be provided through: an Emergency Response Credit (ERC) from IDA Grants, co-financing&#13;
obtained through the Japanese Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) grant, and the&#13;
multi-donor AH1 facility (AHIF). The components have been designed to mirror the strategies&#13;
identified in the National Plan. A relatively large amount o f hnds were left unallocated to&#13;
provide flexibility duringimplementation.&#13;
&#13;
AnimalHealth(Total: US$5.35 million).&#13;
&#13;
Component 1 focuses on controlling the disease in poultry, and is in line with the&#13;
recommendations made by the leading international technical agencies (FAO, OiE and WHO).&#13;
Given the current status o f HPAI in Lao PDR, the component i s directed at investigation,&#13;
surveillance, prevention, and preparedness for any new outbreak. Activities to reduce the risk o f&#13;
AI infection inbackyardpoultry, commercial, and fighting cock production are being supported,&#13;
as are those to increase the capacity for laboratory diagnosis and early detection and response&#13;
(including improving the national information system) at the field-level.           Regional and&#13;
international networking will be supported, as will the training o f veterinarians, in response to&#13;
the need to provide front-line veterinary services and surveillance. Financing i s being provided&#13;
for developing a compensation mechanism, and an indicative amount will be allocated to the&#13;
fund. Access to the fund will require the development o f guidelines that are acceptable to the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
HumanHealth SurveillanceandResponse(Total: US$1.10 million).&#13;
                 -&#13;
Component 2 supports surveillance o f human health and establishes a mechanism for&#13;
responding in the event o f outbreaks.     Activities include capacity building to improve the&#13;
surveillance system and integration o f routine surveillance systems and data. Simulations to&#13;
assess the state o f implementation and effectiveness of public health measures will also be&#13;
covered.&#13;
&#13;
HumanHealth-CurativeServices (Total: US$2.54 million).&#13;
&#13;
Component3 will support key activities related to laboratory and curative care to strengthenthe&#13;
public health sector's response in the event o f an outbreak or declaration o f a pandemic. The&#13;
Government's strategy includes strengthening human resources, infrastructure and border&#13;
control.   Support will be provided for developing and monitoring pandemic preparedness&#13;
activities and improving hospital information systems. The National Plan includes an option to&#13;
finance the construction o f a new laboratory or rehabilitate and improve the biosafety o f the&#13;
existing laboratory. Improving laboratory quality control, including translation and printing o f&#13;
guidelines and capacity buildingare supported underthis component.&#13;
&#13;
Information,Educationand Communication(Total: US$1.87 million).&#13;
&#13;
Component 4 supports the formulation and dissemination o f a national awareness campaign on&#13;
AHI. These activities will be participatory innature and are targeted to the general population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Financing for translation o f the communication tools developed into local and minority&#13;
languages are included.     In order to reach children, messages will be provided through an&#13;
existing school program. A knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) survey will be undertaken to&#13;
establish a baseline. A second KAPwill be conducted inabout 12months and a final survey will&#13;
be fielded at the end o fthe Project.&#13;
&#13;
ProgramCoordinationandRegulatoryFramework(Total: US$2.69million).&#13;
&#13;
Component5 will support planning for the multisectoral activities, necessary inthe event o f an&#13;
outbreak (in either animals or humans), or a pandemic. Financing i s available to review existing&#13;
regulations to ensure that they provide the requisite authority and are sufficiently broad in scope&#13;
to allow for a rapid response inthe event o f a declared emergency. An amount o f $200,000 has&#13;
been set aside for undertaking programmatic research or piloting activities that would inform the&#13;
National Plan.      In addition, support will be provided to the National Committee for&#13;
Communicable Diseases (NC/CDC) and the National Avian and Human Influenza Coordination&#13;
Office (NAHICO), which i s charged with overseeing the implementation of the National Plan.&#13;
Technical assistance, provided to NAHICO, will also provide capacity building to the&#13;
implementing agencies inprocurement, financial management and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
1. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements&#13;
&#13;
A Prime Minister's Decree (No. 377/PM) dated December 9, 2005, established the NC/CDC,&#13;
chaired by the Prime Minister, with representation from key line Ministries and Mass&#13;
Organizations. The same decree established the Secretariat to the NC/CDC, chaired by the Chief&#13;
o f Cabinet o fthe Prime Minister's Office. The Prime Minister's Office, on May 11,2006, issued&#13;
an Agreement (No. 113/PMO) establishing NAHICO and naminga Chair, a Vice Chair andthree&#13;
Members and established the following four Units: (i)        Coordination and Collaboration; (ii)&#13;
Planning andFinance; (iii)   Monitoring and Evaluation; and (iv) Procurement.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation o f World Bank financing o f the National Plan, expected to take four years, will&#13;
be delegated from NAHICO to relevant Ministries and other collaborators (e.g., Mass&#13;
Organizations, among others).       This will result in implementation of Component 1 by the&#13;
Department o f Livestock and Fisheries (DLF) in the Ministry o f Agriculture and Forestry&#13;
(MAF). The Department of Hygiene and Prevention inthe Ministry of Health (MOH) will be&#13;
responsible for implementing Component 2 and the Department o f Curative Services in MOH&#13;
has responsibility for implementing Component 3. NAHICO will have an oversight/coordination&#13;
role in the implementation o f Components 4 and 5, with Component 4 being implemented&#13;
collaboratively by the MOH, MAF, Ministry o f Information and Culture, Ministryo f Education,&#13;
and Mass Organizations (i.e., Youth, Women, and Trade Unions). The implementation o f all but&#13;
the Program Management for Component 5 will be carried out collaboratively with MOH, MAF,&#13;
the Ministry o f Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry o f Justice. NAHICO will have sole&#13;
responsibility for implementation o f the Program Management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results&#13;
&#13;
Monitoringthe National Plan and its implementation will be continuous, with quarterly reporting&#13;
provided to the development partners and interested stakeholders. The reports will not only&#13;
cover physical progress relating to civil works, training, consultancies, and institutional activities&#13;
using performance indicators, but will also include interim financial reports (IFRs).            The&#13;
quarterly reports will maintain a section devoted to issues affecting implementation and the steps&#13;
taken or to be taken to resolve the identified constraints. The fourth quarterly report will serve&#13;
an annual report, covering all activities o f the past year. Reviews o f the Program will be carried&#13;
out jointly with the financing partners on, at least, a semi-annual basis. A Joint Mid-Term&#13;
Review will be conducted to review the progress to date, andto consider any corrections (such as&#13;
the need to modify the World Bank support based on lessons learned, expected outcomes and&#13;
financing available from other sources), that may be required inresponse to a changing situation.&#13;
Within six months o fthe closing date, the Government, andthe World Bank will each prepare an&#13;
Implementation Completion Report providing information on the impact achieved by the Project,&#13;
as well as lessons to benefit similar operations. The overall monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E)&#13;
framework, as well as indicators for the National Program are provided inAnnex 2. World Bank&#13;
specific indicators are presented initalics.&#13;
&#13;
The overall responsibility for M&amp;E, including preparation o f progress reports and annual review&#13;
meetings, rests with the M&amp;E Unit o f NAHICO. In addition to overall supervision o f each&#13;
activity within the National Plan, the Unit will prepare quarterly reports consolidating physical&#13;
and financial progress o f the National Plan from the-implementers and disseminate the report to&#13;
stakeholders and financiers.      Data collection and reporting for Component 1 will be the&#13;
responsibility o f the N A H C and DLF inthe M O M , while Component 2 and 3 indicators will be&#13;
the responsibility o f various units in the M O H (e.g., NCLE, Department o f Curative Services).&#13;
Indicators for Component 4 will be the responsibility o f the National and Provincial Infection&#13;
Coordination Office and the Province and District Level IEC Units, under the overall guidance&#13;
o fNAHICO. Indicators for Component 5 will be collected andreportedby NAHICO.&#13;
&#13;
3. Sustainability, critical risks and possible controversialaspects&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability. Strong political support and leadership, an adequate flow o f financial resources&#13;
and the continuous ownership by the various stakeholders will be critical to project&#13;
sustainability.  Government has demonstrated a very strong commitment to AH1 control and&#13;
preparedness. The establishment o f NC/CDC and NAHICO further cements the Government's&#13;
strong support for a national multisectoral response. Ownership by all stakeholders will be&#13;
ensured by: (i)  strengthening o fprograms to maintainpublic awareness o fthe threat o f HPAIand&#13;
other rapidly spreading infectious diseases; and (ii)    sustained surveillance and prevention and&#13;
control activities, particularly inhigh-risk regions.&#13;

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
1. Economicandfinancialanalyses&#13;
&#13;
The sequence o f 45 reported outbreaks during Jan-March 2004 in Lao PDR led to the death&#13;
through disease or culling o f 155,000 heads o f poultry, valued at approximately US$0.32 million&#13;
at 2004 prices. Future outbreaks remain possible as the disease circulates among birds in&#13;
neighboring countries. Given the concentration o f poultry farming inthree provinces (Vientiane,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Champansek, and Savannakhet) any future avian outbreaks o f H5N1 may rapidly put a&#13;
significant portion o f the flock at risk.&#13;
&#13;
Lao PDRhas so far not reported any laboratory confirmed human cases. However, it would be at&#13;
significant risk in the event o f a human pandemic because o f a burdened health system with&#13;
inadequate resources. Just avoiding the notional loss o f income from the mortality after a&#13;
country-wide attack rate o f 20 percent and a fatality rate o f 2 percent would imply enormous&#13;
returns.&#13;
&#13;
The recurrent cost implications o f the Program are not expected to pose a burden on government&#13;
finances given that many o f the operating costs o f infrastructurebuilt or equipment purchased are&#13;
beingmet (or the infrastructureis notnew). For further detail, see Appendix 10.&#13;
&#13;
The Program, recognizing the national and even global public goods nature o f the animal and&#13;
human health preventive and mitigatory investments herein, has made a significant original&#13;
investment in building up Lao PDR's responsive capacity. Also, since infectious diseases&#13;
emerging from the sphere o f animal-human interaction threaten to be globally transmittable and&#13;
highlydisruptive, the investmentinLaoPDRhas beneficial externalities beyondits borders.&#13;
&#13;
2. Technical&#13;
&#13;
The National Plan was prepared in direct consultation with, and support from, the lead technical&#13;
agencies on AH1and establishes the framework withinwhich support for AH1i s beingprovided&#13;
by the development partners. The technical appraisal looked at the activities proposed and the&#13;
appropriate sequencing to ensure that the funding available will target key areas requiring&#13;
support.&#13;
&#13;
Based on lessons learned during the 2004 outbreak in poultry, the project has adopted a multi-&#13;
pronged approach, which includes distributing relevant information on AH1 to the public,&#13;
strengthening the early detection and warning system at the field level, and improving the&#13;
capacity for a rapid and effective response to an outbreak. The health sector will be prepared to&#13;
respond in the event o f human outbreaks and the capacity at the central level and the&#13;
decentralized level will be strengthened to carry out investigations with MAF staff. Linkages o f&#13;
the human and animal routine (weekly) surveillance systems and data will also be made. The&#13;
formulation (in consultation with MAF, MOH, Mass Organizations) and carrying out o f an&#13;
awareness campaign targeting the population in general is supported, utilizing community level&#13;
interventions.&#13;
&#13;
3. Fiduciary&#13;
&#13;
An assessment o f the project financial management arrangements was carried out by the Bank's&#13;
financial management team during project appraisal inMay 2006. After reviewing the financial&#13;
management capacity o f the principal implementing agencies, an action plan to strengthen the&#13;
project financial management arrangements was agreed with the Government o f Lao PDR. With&#13;
the implementation o f the agreed actions as conditions o f effectiveness, and a condition o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
disbursement for two categories, the project financial management arrangements are considered&#13;
adequate to meet the World Bank's minimumrequirements (see Appendix 7 for details).&#13;
&#13;
Activities financed through IDA will be procured in accordance with procedures set forth in the&#13;
World Bank "Guidelines - Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004&#13;
("the Guidelines").   Consultant services will be selected and employed utilizing "Guidelines:&#13;
Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank borrowers" dated May 2004 ("the&#13;
Consultant Guidelines").   A procurement capacity assessment was undertaken during appraisal&#13;
which found a need to strengthen the capacity for procurement utilizing financing beingprovided&#13;
through the World Bank (see Appendix 6).&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Methods and Procurement Plan. The emergency nature o f the Project requires the&#13;
use of methods that would allow procurement to be made inthe shortest possible time while still&#13;
ensuring a reasonable degree o f competition and transparency. Given the small value and nature&#13;
o f procurement packages, the proposed methods include shopping, procurement from specialized&#13;
UNagencies, direct contracting and individual consultants inaccordance with the provisions of&#13;
the Guidelines and Consultant Guidelines, May 2004. A preliminary procurement plan has been&#13;
developed.&#13;
&#13;
 4. Social&#13;
&#13;
The Project is expected to contribute to minimizing the impact o f outbreaks and a human&#13;
pandemic byhaving inplace a surveillance and response system to reduce the potential impact o f&#13;
an unchecked outbreak in the avian population. In addition, the Project will be financing an&#13;
analysis o f possible compensation packages, including their relative merits and sustainability, in&#13;
order to be prepared for a possible outbreak. Ensuring that there i s a proper response to any&#13;
outbreak in animals (including poultry) should help to ameliorate the potential o f humans&#13;
contracting the disease and possibly passing it on to others. The Project's support to improving&#13;
the surveillance, conducting public awareness campaigns (including translation of messages into&#13;
ethnic languages), and putting in place a preparedness plan, should help to prevent or, in the&#13;
event o f a pandemic, reduce the impact on the population. The integrated surveillance system to&#13;
be supported bythe Project will reinforce the multi-sectoral response necessaryto this threat.&#13;
&#13;
5. Environmental and social safeguard policies&#13;
&#13;
The project i s not expected to have any large-scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts as its&#13;
activities focus largely on public sector capacity buildingand ensuring readiness for preventing&#13;
or reducing possible human infections. This will be achieved by strengthening emergency&#13;
preparedness and response to outbreaks o f AI in domestic poultry.            The project design&#13;
incorporates other beneficial measures such as improved biosecurity in farms and live markets,&#13;
and control o f poultry movement within and across countries.       The project activities aim at&#13;
improving the effectiveness and safety over the existing AI practices and will have positive&#13;
human health and environmental impacts.       Among the Bank's safeguards policies, only the&#13;
policies on Environmental Assessment and Indigenous Peoples are triggered. The project design&#13;
incorporates the necessary mitigation measures for the adverse impacts associated with the&#13;
activities involved in responding to AI outbreaks. A draft Environmental Management Plan&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
(EMP) and Ethnic Group PlanningFramework (EGPF) havebeenprepared and will be finalized&#13;
during project implementation.    The EMP and EGPF will be disclosed in Lao PDR and&#13;
Washington D.C. (Infoshop) after consultation with various Government agencies, the&#13;
commercial poultry associations, mass organizations, and NGOs. The Financing Agreement will&#13;
reflect implementationofthe EMP andEGPF.&#13;
&#13;
6. Policy Exceptions and Readiness&#13;
&#13;
The project meets the criteria for readiness for implementation and no policy exceptions are&#13;
anticipated.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     1.       Lao PDR is a landlocked country that shares borders with countries most affected by the&#13;
     recent outbreaks o f Influenza A virus (H5N1), namely Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and China.&#13;
     These borders are largely permeable with legal and illegal crossing o f people, animals, and food&#13;
     products. While the population o f Lao PDR is not large, 5.6 million, the majority o f these people&#13;
     live in rural and remote mountainous areas, with the attendant challenges o f communications,&#13;
     transport, and service provision. There are 141 Districts in the 16 Provinces and the capital o f&#13;
     Vientiane. The population is also ethnically diverse; 49 distinct ethnic groups speak different&#13;
     languages, and have different cultures. With a per capita income in 2005 o f US$380, Lao PDR&#13;
     is classed among the Least Developed Countries.&#13;
&#13;
     2.       Animal Health. Lao PDR reported its first and only wave o f avian influenza (H5N1)&#13;
     outbreaks inthe poultry population inearly 2004: a total o f 45 incidents were reported from the&#13;
     mid-January to the end o f March, 2004. Vientiane had 38, Champasak had 5, and Savanakhet&#13;
     had 2, with 42 reports from commercial enterprises and 3 from villages (38 in Vientiane, 5 in&#13;
     Champasak and 2 in Savanakhet). Approximately 155,000 poultry died: 1/3 from the disease&#13;
     and the remainder from culling. The MAF estimated that the cost o f investigation, response, and&#13;
     management o fthe outbreaks was US$4 million. While no further outbreaks have beenreported,&#13;
     it is suspected that more outbreaks may have occurred inrural areas, but were either undetected&#13;
     or unreported. InMay 2006 Government reported that a sample taken from a duck inVientiane&#13;
     in February 2006 was confirmed positive for H5N1. To date there have been no human cases&#13;
     reported, although it i s possible that they have occurred but were either undetected or unreported.&#13;
     There are approximately 20 million poultry in Lao PDR, with around 20 percent held in more&#13;
     than 120 commercial enterprises which serve the larger urban populations in Vientiane, Luang&#13;
     Prabang, Champasak and Savanakhet. The remaining poultry, found inall Provinces, are owned&#13;
     by subsistence farmers for personalfamily consumption.&#13;
&#13;
     3.       The veterinary services in Lao PDR have been plagued by a chronic shortage o f&#13;
     veterinarians serving the agriculture sector.      Of the 69 fully qualified veterinarians, 12 are&#13;
     employed in the DLF o f the MAF in Vientiane. Approximately 893 government personnel are&#13;
     involved in animal production and animal disease control programs at the national, Provincial&#13;
     and District levels, and there are 785 livestock officers located at 17 Provincial livestock offices.&#13;
     The 11,180 villages are supported by 5,177 VVWs administering animal health services; their&#13;
     time is spent on cattle, buffalo, pigs (50 percent), dogs and cats (30 percent), poultry (20&#13;
     percent).&#13;
&#13;
     4.       Laboratory capacity i s ingeneral a major constraint to improved surveillance for HPAI.&#13;
     FA0has supported the purchase o f essential equipment required to detect HPAI for the NAHC&#13;
     inVientiane, and laboratory staffhavebeentrained ontest methods as well as quality assurance,&#13;
.t   and bio-safety/containment procedures. Some personal protective equipment (PPE) i s available&#13;
     and i s being shared between the MAF and MOH.&#13;
&#13;
     5.      Lao PDR's health care system has one o f the lowest per capita health expenditures in&#13;
     Asia (US$12); Government spending on health provision i s heavily supplemented by household&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
expenditures and contributions from donors. The system i s characterized by insufficient health&#13;
workers in absolute terms, compared to international norms, a lack o f essential drugs (and&#13;
irrational use o f drugs), and a lack o f neededor functional equipment. However, considerable&#13;
external investment in health over the past 10 years has led to significant improvements. A&#13;
major constraint remains the lack o f funds for recurrent expenditures; the sector is quite project-&#13;
driven which complicates health sector management. The capital, Vientiane, has four Referral&#13;
Hospitals andthree Specialized Hospitals. There are four Regional Hospitals, and each o f the 16&#13;
Provinces has a Provincial Hospital; there are 141 District Hospitals, and 789 Health Centers.&#13;
Many health facilities have insufficient professional medical and administrative staff, limited&#13;
essential drugs and basic equipment; there is an absolute shortage o f health workers which i s&#13;
compounded by skewed distribution (most workers live and work in urban areas), and their skill&#13;
level tends to be low. The perceived low quality, which relates to health worker motivation and&#13;
skills, quality of facilities, and also to a lack o f knowledge about the need for health care, often&#13;
leads to quite low utilization o f health facilities. The number o f patient services provided per&#13;
health worker or health facility is actually low, which speaks to inefficiencies in the health&#13;
system.    The dependence on user fees for recurrent costs may also contribute to the&#13;
underutilization o f facilities. At the community level, 14,000 VHVs are, or have been, working&#13;
mainly on malaria and the drug-kit programs after receiving limited training (from a few days to&#13;
six weeks). Although there i s a 10bedisolation ward inVientiane, and at least one new isolation&#13;
ward was build in six locations in response to SARS, most hospitals have insufficient isolation&#13;
rooms, inadequate equipment and staff to provide intensive care for patients with severe&#13;
respiratory diseases; unsafe methods are still utilized to dispose hospital waste disposal. Nursing&#13;
practice needs to be upgraded to improve isolation procedures in order to improve both patient&#13;
and health worker safety.       The hospitals and health centers are supervised by the Curative&#13;
Department o f the MOH while the surveillance and public health laboratory i s the responsibility&#13;
o f the Department o fPreventionandHygiene.&#13;
&#13;
6.      The public health communicable disease surveillance system i s carried out by the&#13;
NCLE, located in Vientiane, supported by 17 Provincial Surveillance Units, and 141 District&#13;
Health Offices. The NCLE carries out surveillance, case and outbreak investigation, response,&#13;
and research, and serves as the public health laboratory and the national reference lab. There is a&#13;
weekly communicable disease reporting system which includes 18 conditions, to which&#13;
influenza, avian influenza and ILIare currently in the process o f being added. NCLE has also&#13;
been receiving support from the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU-2) to implement a&#13;
computerized Early Warning Outbreak Recognition System (EWORS) in the four hospitals in&#13;
Vientiane and in three o f the four Regional Hospitals. EWORS i s a symptom-based hospital&#13;
surveillance system that collects and sends data to NCLE on a daily basis from the outpatient and&#13;
emergency rooms. Currentlythe reporting i s only produced on a monthbasis, and the data i s not&#13;
being used to its capacity. The Provincial Surveillance Unit has between two to four staff with&#13;
variable levels o f training, consequently NCLE staff often conduct outbreak investigations and&#13;
response, leaving little or no time for other tasks; District level staff are typically not qualified in&#13;
epidemiology, carry out many public health activities, and also work at the District Hospital. The&#13;
Health Centers and some District Health Offices lack communication equipment (i.e.,&#13;
telephones, faxes and/or radios), makingit difficult to report health events to the next level up in&#13;
a timely manner.&#13;
&#13;

                                                    15&#13;

7.       Thepublic health laboratory structure has four central laboratories inVientiane, four in&#13;
the Regions, 13 at Provincial level and 125 at District level laboratories. Although the NCLE&#13;
acts as the public health and national reference laboratory, it has not achieved biosafety level 2&#13;
status and currently does not have the capacity to perform influenza diagnosis, consequently&#13;
suspected AI specimens are shipped out of the country for testing and then to reference&#13;
laboratories for confirmation.        A capacity to use RT-PCR techniques for identification o f&#13;
influenza is being established as an interim step in upgrading influenza diagnostic capacity and&#13;
should be operational by the end o f 2006; until then viral culture o f human influenza will still be&#13;
analyzed outside of Lao PDR. The overall performance o f the national and peripheral&#13;
laboratories is relatively low due to inadequate human (trained lab technicians) and financial&#13;
(equipment and supply of reagents) resources. A long-term plan for enhancing the public health&#13;
laboratory i s desirable, and it i s recognizedthat this may require an entirelynew facility and also&#13;
considerable investment intraining laboratory workers.&#13;
&#13;
8.       An awareness campaign was carried out during, and following, the 2004 outbreak and&#13;
included distribution o f leaflets to Provincial and District animal field officers, and to farms and&#13;
villages inVientiane, where radio andtelevision messages were also broadcast. Several booklets&#13;
and handouts were also produced to educate bird owners and VVW on the signs o f HPAI and&#13;
preventivemeasures such as bio-security. A participatory national AI Communication workshop&#13;
was heldinMay, 2006, attended by key government stakeholders, mass media, television, mass&#13;
organizations, the UnitedNations and other international agencies. The purpose was to develop&#13;
an overall communication action plan for AH1pandemic preparedness. One outcome was the&#13;
establishment o f an IEC AI Communication Taskforce with representatives from Government,&#13;
UNagencies, non-governmentalorganizations, andmass organizations. A second outcomewas&#13;
the development o f an action plan for development, within three months, of communication tools&#13;
on hygieneand food safety.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Government established (throughOrder No. 02/Decree No. 17) the NC/CDC, and Decree&#13;
No. 377 has named the Prime Minister as the chair, giving this multi-sectoral body more&#13;
authority, and established a Secretariat to the CDC. In addition, Agriculture Ministerial Orders&#13;
(0012, 0075, 1067) and Department Order 172 have been issued to ban the importation o f&#13;
poultry and poultry products from neighboring countries with HPAI.                   A February 16&#13;
Announcement (No. 242)             from the Prime Minister's       Office provides guidance on&#13;
implementation o f Avian Influenza and Massive Disaster, indicating the responsibility for each&#13;
o f the five strategies from the National Plan. A May 11,2006 Agreement (No. 113/PMO) issued&#13;
by the Prime Minister's Office established NAHICO and gave the names o f the Board&#13;
responsible for its activities and coordinating the strategies which cover animal health, human&#13;
health, as well as IEC, and institutional andlegal frameworks.&#13;

         LAO PDR:Avian andHumanInfluenzaControlandPreparednessProject&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
Implementation o f the National Planwill be financed by the World Bank (IDA grant, PHRD, and&#13;
AHIF) as well as other donors, many o f whom are providing their funding through technical&#13;
agencies such as WHO, FAO, and UNICEF, who are using their own resources as well. As all&#13;
the donors have a limited amount o f funds available andactivities they can (or cannot) fund (e.g.,&#13;
PHRD can only be used for 75 percent o f the total training and technical assistance required),&#13;
many related activities that are necessary to achieve the objectives o f each strategy are being&#13;
funded through multiple donors. The Government and the financiers have agreed to establish&#13;
one monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) framework and a set o f Program indicators that will be&#13;
used to monitor the implementation progress o f the National Plan. The results framework&#13;
includes not only the indicators for the activities that will be supported by the World Bank, but&#13;
also those that will be supported by other donors. The indicators for the activities that are&#13;
directly supported by the Bank are italicizedbelow.&#13;
&#13;
Given the uncertainty o f the situation, and the fact that the planned activities may need to be&#13;
modified during implementation as the phase o f epidemic changes, the emphasis will be on&#13;
monitoring the implementationprogress o f various activities under the National Plan rather than&#13;
on evaluation. The evaluationwill be limitedto compliance, accountability, andprogress, except&#13;
for certain activities that canbe implementedregardless o fthe epidemic phases (e.g., IEC).&#13;
&#13;
Purpose&#13;
M&amp;E is intendedto demonstrate: (i)how well a series o f activities under the National Plan are&#13;
achieving their stated objectives (this i s accomplished by routinely collecting data on&#13;
performance indicators and comparing actual results with targets; and (ii)       why the intended&#13;
results are (or are not) achieved by assessing specific contribution o f activities to the results.&#13;
Therefore,   the M&amp;E process and results will not only inform achievements and&#13;
recommendations for improvement, but also alert decision makers, or relevant stakeholders, to&#13;
actual and potential problems duringimplementation so that adjustment can be made.&#13;
&#13;
Mechanism:responsibility,reporting,andfeedback&#13;
The primary responsibility for M&amp;E o f implementationprogress will rest with the implementing&#13;
ministries, in close collaboration with relevant technical agencies and donors, as described&#13;
below. Every quarter, the M&amp;E unit in the NAHICO will: (i)        collect the information from the&#13;
M&amp;E focal point for each component; (ii) a quarterly progress report; and (iii) the&#13;
                                             produce                                      share&#13;
report with all the stakeholders. In order to minimize the burden on implementing ministries,&#13;
and to promote information sharing, feedback forwarded to the M&amp;E Unit o f NAHICO will be&#13;
consolidated and shared with the implementing agencies for their information and follow-up, and&#13;
to financiers o f the National Planfor their information.&#13;
&#13;
Quarterly Progress Reports should include: (i) financial reports; (ii)&#13;
                                                  interim                      physical progress o f&#13;
implementation including the achievement toward the objectives using the selected indicators;&#13;
(iii) managementplan(e.g., riskidentificationandcontrolplan);and(iv)anyotheressential&#13;
     risk&#13;
information that needs to be shared with stakeholders (e.g., AH1 situation, additional funding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
sources and activities that will be undertaken with those funds). The fourth quarterly progress&#13;
report per year will serve as an annual progress report, and should include annual achievements.&#13;
NAHICO will organize semi-annual review meetings with the financiers to evaluate the&#13;
achievements and lessons learned, as well as planning for the year ahead indetail.&#13;
&#13;
Inaddition, ajoint mid-termreview, based on a mid-termprogress report to be prepared bythe&#13;
Government and/or independent assessors, will be conducted approximately halfway through the&#13;
project. The joint review will evaluate the progress to date and discuss any proposed changes&#13;
which may be required based on the situation on the ground, including reallocation, design,&#13;
and/or expected outcomes among others.&#13;

Current M&amp;E capacity and technical assistance needed&#13;
Given the emergency nature o f the program, quite a few activities are planned inthe first couple&#13;
o f years, and thereby need to be monitored.       Although indicators are carefully chosen to&#13;
minimize the additional burden of collecting data whenever possible, considerable efforts still&#13;
have to be made to ensure the proper implementation and M&amp;E o f the activities under the&#13;
National Plan. However, M&amp;E capacity, which varies by implementing agency, is generally&#13;
weak in Lao PDR. Consequently the following is recommended to build and/or complement&#13;
existing capacity.&#13;
&#13;
        9  M&amp;E focal point - the M&amp;E technical assistant to be hired for NAHICO should&#13;
        .  provide capacity buildingto implementing agencies.&#13;
&#13;
           Training&#13;
           a. Initial training on basic M&amp;E and requirements for reporting - this three to five&#13;
               day training should be attended by M&amp;E focal points as well as senior officials&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    from each implementing Ministry; participation o f senior officials for at least a&#13;
    day will contribute to ensuringthe proper allocation o f staff time and resource on&#13;
    M&amp;E.&#13;
&#13;
 b. Refresher training-At least one month before the first annual report is prepared,&#13;
    refresher training should be offered for M&amp;E focal points to make sure the timely&#13;
    preparation o f the report for discussion at the annual meeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 c. Time and finance permitting, the M&amp;E focal points should also be offered in-&#13;
.   depth training inM&amp;E,possibly out o f the country.&#13;
&#13;
 Technical assistance may also be needed to finalize the operational plan o f M&amp;E, to&#13;
 standardize reporting forms, and to prepare annual and mid-term review reports and&#13;
 meetings, among others.&#13;

          LAO PDR:Avian andHumanInfluenzaControlandPreparednessProject&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank is one o f the financiers o f the National Plan, with FAO, and OiE supporting&#13;
component 1, WHO i s supporting components 2,3 and 5, andthe United Nations' Children Fund&#13;
(UNICEF), and the Academy for Educational Development (AED) supporting component 4; the&#13;
United Nations Development Program i s also providing support for component 5. Inaddition to&#13;
using their internal budgets where available, these organizations have also received financing&#13;
from the Governments o f Germany, the United States, Luxembourg, among others. The Asia&#13;
Development Bank i s also providing support for activities within the National Plan. Every effort&#13;
has been made to ensure that there i s no overlap o f support or duplication o f effort; as other&#13;
support to the National Plan becomes available in the future, or if additional financing from&#13;
existing financiers becomes available, the World Bank resources will be re-directed to areas&#13;
within the National Plan where shortfalls exist. While details o f anticipated activities to be&#13;
provided through World Bank financing are described below, it is understood that there will be&#13;
flexibility of activities to be financed, given the impossibility to predict the needs, except for&#13;
some immediate term requirements, as well as the possibility o f financiers providing additional&#13;
funding.    Following i s a description o f each component (which corresponds to each o f&#13;
Government's strategies), with an indication o fthe activities currently proposed for funding from&#13;
the World Bank either through an IDAgrant, PHRDor AHIF resources.&#13;
&#13;
Component1: AnimalHealth(Total: US$5.35 million).&#13;
This component, directed specifically at the control o f the disease in poultry, will be&#13;
implemented by the DLF inthe MAF, with support from FA0 and OiE. The activities supported&#13;
under this component are in line with the recommendations o f FA0 and OiE, and, given the&#13;
current status o f H P A I in Lao PDR, i s appropriately directed at investigation, surveillance,&#13;
prevention and preparedness for any new outbreak.            This support i s based on detailed&#13;
assessments of the AI epidemiological status, o f the capacity o f national veterinary services to&#13;
cope with H P A I epidemic, and the vulnerability o f the poultry industry to emerging infectious&#13;
diseases.   Subcomponents cover reduction o f risk, enhancing capacity for early detection,&#13;
strengthening capacity for laboratory diagnosis, research and development, improving the&#13;
national information system, enhancing the response and the networking between sectors within&#13;
the country, region and internationally, as well as the provision o fveterinary training.&#13;
&#13;
As indicated above, FA0 (through its own resources and those provided to them by other&#13;
financiers) and OiE are supporting various activities presented in the Plan. Financing provided&#13;
through World Bank resources, which are complementary to this support, include activities&#13;
associated with reducing the risk o f HPAI in the commercial sector, and targeted interventions&#13;
directed at fighting cock production. To support early detection, consultants will be financed to&#13;
prepare guidelines and procedures for use at internal and cross-border checkpoints, and vehicles&#13;
will be provided. To complement FA0 support, World Bank financing will cover research&#13;
related to the monitoring o f national and international poultry movements.            The national&#13;
information system will be supported by the World Bank through the provision of&#13;
communication equipment. Rapid response will be supported through the financing o f transport&#13;
and per diems (usingUnitedNations rates). World Bank financing will be provided to complete&#13;
the national veterinary laboratory.     In addition to funding provided by FAO, World Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
financing i s available to contribute to the design o f a compensation plan (such as the preparation&#13;
o f procedures and guidelines), as well as compensation to owners o f culled poultry. Networking&#13;
activities (internally, regionally and nationally) will be supported, as will the training o f&#13;
veterinarians within the region.&#13;
&#13;
Component2: HumanHealth: Surveillanceand Response(Total: US$l.10million).&#13;
This component intends to support Lao PDR's preparedness by improving the surveillance o f&#13;
human health, as well as putting in place a mechanism for responding in the event that human&#13;
cases are discovered. Financing for this component i s being provided by WHO, with the World&#13;
Bank financing the training in field-based epidemiology, the provision and operating costs o f&#13;
mobile phone, vehicles, and M&amp;E o f activities supported under this component.&#13;
&#13;
Component3: HumanHealth: CurativeServices (Total: US$2.54 million).&#13;
Government's plan divides key response activities into those that support curative services, and&#13;
those that support laboratory activities. Financing i s available through WHO for many o f the&#13;
activities, but additional support is required, and will be provided through World Bank financing.&#13;
M&amp;E of Component 3 will be financed through World Bank sources, as will the purchase and&#13;
operating costs o f ambulances to transport patients, costs associated with health care waste&#13;
management (including evaluation o f current plans, provision of, training on, and operating costs&#13;
associated with relevant equipment). Financing through the World Bank could also cover health&#13;
staff at checkpoints, and the establishment and running costs for improving the surveillance&#13;
system at five hospitals (support for the remaining hospitals i s being provided through other&#13;
donors) for improving the surveillance system.          Financing for rehabilitation o f the existing&#13;
laboratory is also included in financing from the World Bank; support for this will also require&#13;
the inclusion o f relevant skills for design and supervision o f the civil works.&#13;
&#13;
Component4: Information,Educationand Communication(IEC) (Total: US$1.87 million).&#13;
IEC is an important tool in the arsenal for a comprehensive response to conditions within the&#13;
country, in the animal and human health sectors, as well as the public in general. Support for&#13;
this important activity i s being provided through funding given to UNICEF, and AED. Efforts&#13;
will be made to ensure that communications tools which are designed are culturally appropriate&#13;
and translated into languages to ensure that ethnic groups are reached inthe process. Financing&#13;
from World Bank resources will cover survey(s) to assess the effectiveness o f various IEC&#13;
interventions inthe National Plan.&#13;
&#13;
Component5: ProgramCoordinationandRegulatoryFramework(Total: US$2.67 million).&#13;
Given the multisectoral response required in the event o f an outbreak (in either animals, or&#13;
humans), or a pandemic, the need for a well coordinated response has been identified as critical.&#13;
The recent establishment o fNAHICO, to take the lead incoordinating this response and to report&#13;
on progress inimplementing the Plan to the NC/CDC is most welcome. This component will be&#13;
coordinated by NAHICO, with implementation to be delegated to relevant Ministries. Support&#13;
necessary to manage World Bank financing will be handled by NAHICO. Given the fact that&#13;
NAHICO will be responsible for overall M&amp;E o f the National Plan, financing for activities&#13;
associated with M&amp;E is being made available from the World Bank. Other activities which the&#13;
World Bank financing will cover support to the NC/CDC, desktop pandemic simulation,&#13;
provision o f PPEs and their management, and the review and recommendation o f existing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
regulations, and drafting new ones if needed to ensure an efficient response in the event o f an&#13;
outbreak or pandemic. Financing i s also provided for research on pandemic preparedness and&#13;
piloting innovative activities to reduce the risk o f HPAI infection. Assistance associated with&#13;
overall management o f the Plan, including support for collaboration, and requisite financial,&#13;
procurement, and monitoring and evaluation capacity will be provided through World Bank&#13;
financing under this component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                    Appendix 4: ProjectCoordinationandImplementation&#13;
          LAO PDR:Avian andHumanInfluenzaControlandPreparednessProject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The coordination framework was described in a Notification o f Prime Ministers Office No.&#13;
242/PMO, dated February 16, 2006, where the implementation arrangements for Strategy 1 are&#13;
vested with MAF, and Strategies 2 and 3 rest with MOH. While the implementation o f&#13;
Strategies 4 and 5 indicates that MOH should lead, it i s expected to do so incollaboration with a&#13;
variety o f Ministries and Mass Organizations. Collaborating partners include MAF, MOH, the&#13;
Ministry ofEducation, the Ministry ofInformation and Culture, Ministry of Justice, Ministryof&#13;
Foreign Affairs, Lao Women's Union, Lao Youth Union, Lao Trade Union, among others. On&#13;
May 11, 2006 NAHICO was established through Decree No. 113/PM, further cementing&#13;
Government's commitment to a multi-sectoral approach to AH1 control and preparedness;&#13;
NAHICO i s expected to provide a coordinating role in activities undertaken by line ministries,&#13;
and to report to NC/CDC on progress inimplementing the National Plan.&#13;
&#13;
The Decree names the director, deputydirector, and members o fthe Board(intotal comprising 5&#13;
people), and notes that there would be four Units under NAHICO, namely, Coordination and&#13;
Collaboration, Planning and Finance, M&amp;E, and Procurement.                The Coordination and&#13;
Collaboration Unit will be working closely with the partners supporting the National Plan. It is&#13;
expected that the Financial Management Specialist to be financed by the World Bank will be&#13;
located inthe Finance and Planning Unit supporting to NAHICO; this function will also provide&#13;
capacity buildingto line Ministries charged with the responsibility for implementingthe National&#13;
Plan.    The M&amp;E Unit should be headed by an internally recruited person, who will be&#13;
responsible for the continuous M&amp;E o f the National Plan activities, and providing capacity&#13;
building to implementing agencies. The results framework (see Appendix 2), agreed between&#13;
the Government and financiers o f the National Plan, will form the basis for at least semi-annual&#13;
evaluations o fprogress against targets.&#13;
&#13;
Since only World Bank financing will flow to the Government directly, the Procurement Unit&#13;
will be staffed by a Procurement Specialist, who will have the ultimate responsibility for&#13;
ensuring that the procurement documentationi s prepared appropriately, with relevant input from&#13;
line ministries.    In addition to providing technical assistance to NAHICO, the financial&#13;
management and procurement specialists to be recruited are also expected to help develop&#13;
capacity in line ministries with implementation responsibilities.     The recommendation is for&#13;
Government to consider preparing terms o f reference for hiring a firm which would be in a&#13;
position to put together a team (for at least financial management and procurement, if not M&amp;E&#13;
as well) to provide the necessary support and capacity buildingto the implementing agencies o f&#13;
the National Planwhich wouldbereceiving financial support through the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The May 2006 Decree allows NAHICO to approach relevant ministries to seek their nomination&#13;
o f staff to provide support to NAHICO. It i s assumed that this support will be part time in&#13;
nature, since most Government staff already have full time responsibilities. It i s therefore&#13;
anticipated that the only f i l l time staff working in NAHICO will be those contracted, and paid&#13;
for from financing sources provided through the World Bank. NAHICO i s envisaged as a small,&#13;
efficient organization, which will not draw technical staff from line ministries, to the detriment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o f the functions within the line ministries, to fill positions within NAHICO.          Given the&#13;
emergency nature o f the problem at hand, it i s also clear that it will be important to have a&#13;
mechanism which would allow for complete delegation; the current Board consists o f Ministry&#13;
staff with other commitments. Considerationneeds to be given to having someone (presumably&#13;
within Government) who would have the delegated authority to ensure that activities, supported&#13;
through financing available through the World Bank, do not come to a standstill in the absence&#13;
o f the requisite decision maker.&#13;
&#13;
NAHICO will be delegating implementation responsibility to the relevant Ministries. It i s&#13;
understood that Component/Strategy 1 would be delegated to the DLF o f MAF, where a&#13;
dedicated team would be constituted to carry out the activities o f the National Plan; financing&#13;
from the World Bank resources could cover the necessary consultants (see the description above&#13;
as one example o f capacity building) to augment the capacity within the Department with respect&#13;
to financial management. Implementation o f Components/Strategies 2 and 3 would be the&#13;
responsibility o f the Department o f Hygiene and Prevention and the Curative Department o f the&#13;
MOHrespectively. These Departments would assign staff to be responsible for ensuringthat the&#13;
Subcomponents/Measures are carried out accordingto the National Plan.&#13;
&#13;
Activities under Component/Strategy 4 are entirely financed through resources obtained by&#13;
UNICEF and AED (the full funding o f the National Plan), with the exception o f a KAP to be&#13;
financed by World Bank resources at the end o f the Project. Activities would be undertaken by&#13;
multiple implementers; the Ministry o f Information and Culture, MAF, MOH, and mass&#13;
organization, with NAHICO playing a coordinating role. NAHICO will be responsible for&#13;
contracting the KAP survey which will serve as to inform on progress during implementation.&#13;
Component/Strategy 5 comprises a number o f cross cutting activities, such as pandemic&#13;
preparedness, stockpiling o f supplies, and overall program management, among other activities.&#13;
Responsibility for oversight o f the implementation, to be carried out by a number o f&#13;
collaborators, rests with NAHICO. In particular NAHICO will be responsible for ensuring&#13;
overall Program implementation, including procurement, financial management, timely reporting&#13;
and coordination (not only among relevant Lao stakeholders, but also with the donor&#13;
community). NAHICO will provide the forum for gathering interested stakeholders inAHI, and&#13;
convene meetings to discuss relevant topics; it will also be responsible for hosting at least semi-&#13;
annual reviews o f the implementationprogress o f the National Plan with the financiers and other&#13;
stakeholders. Terms o f reference for the coordination activity is inthe process o f being finalized&#13;
and will be included in the PIP.        Following i s an organogram depicting reporting and&#13;
organizational arrangements.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
As described in OP 8.50 for Emergency Recovery Assistance (ERA), in addition to emergency&#13;
assistance, the Bank may support operations for prevention and mitigation in countries prone to&#13;
specific types of emergencies. This may comprise: (i)developing a national strategy; (ii)&#13;
establishing an adequate institutional and regulatory framework; (iii)    carrying out studies o f&#13;
vulnerability andrisk assessment; (iv) reinforcing vulnerable structures; and (v) acquiring hazard&#13;
reduction technology. Given the threat that AH1may pose to the economic and social fabric o f&#13;
the country, as well as to the health of the population because of the risk o f an influenza&#13;
pandemic, the Project will be financed through an IDA Grant to be approved following ERA&#13;
procedures.&#13;
Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with World Bank&#13;
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (Guidelines), May 2004; and&#13;
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (Consultant&#13;
Guidelines), May 2004 and the provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement. The general&#13;
description o f various items under different expenditure categories are described below. A&#13;
detailed Procurement Plan covering the first 18 months o f the project implementation was&#13;
provided by the Project Implementing Agency (NAHICO) prior to the negotiations.               The&#13;
Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project&#13;
implementation needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CivilWorks&#13;
Civil Works contracts estimated to cost US$300,000 or more per contract will be procured using&#13;
the World Bank's international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures and Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents. These include constructiodrehabilitation o f two laboratories. Works estimated to&#13;
cost less than US$300,000 but more than US$40,000 per contract will beprocured using national&#13;
competitive bidding (NCB) procedure. These may include construction o f quarantine rooms.&#13;
Procurement will be done through N C B in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines&#13;
and following the detailed procedures for Public Bidding as laid out inDecree No.O3/PM dated&#13;
January 9, 2004, and ImplementingRules &amp; RegulationsNo. 0063/MOF (IRRs) dated March 12,&#13;
2004, in that they complement each other. The national standard bidding documents developed&#13;
by the Procurement Monitoring Office (PrMO), Ministry of Finance, may be used subject to&#13;
modifications required by the Bank. Small works such smaller quarantine rooms or fences.&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$40,000 per contract may be procuredthrough shopping, following&#13;
the detailed procedures for Price Comparison as laid out in the above-mentioned Decree and&#13;
IRRs, incorporating the Special Provisions listed below, and usingthe national standard Request&#13;
for Quotation (RFQ) documents developed byPrMO.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Goods and Non-Consulting Services&#13;
Goods procured under the proposed project include, but are not limited to, office,&#13;
communication, and laboratory equipment, office supplies, software and hardware, PPE, drugs,&#13;
and vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
ICB using the Bank's standard procedure and Standard Bidding Documents will be used for&#13;
packages estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO or more per contract. Vehicles may be procured from&#13;
IAPSO. N C B will be used for packages estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO but more than&#13;
US$20,000 per contract in accordance with the World Bank's Guidelines and following the&#13;
detailed procedures as laid out in the above-referenced Decree and IRRs, in that they&#13;
complement each other. The national standard bidding documents developed by PrMO may be&#13;
used subject to modifications required by the Bank. Such I C B packages would comprise&#13;
relatively large value o f goods not readily available in the local market. However, if these&#13;
packages will be required for emergency operations, faster procurement methods such as&#13;
shoppingmay be allowed on an exceptionalbasis. Shopping may be usedfor contracts estimated&#13;
to cost less than US$20,000 each and would cover most o f the equipment and supplies required&#13;
for the project.  The procedure for shopping shall follow the detailed procedures for Price&#13;
Comparison as laid out in the above-mentioned Decree and IRRs, incorporating the special&#13;
provisions for shopping listedbelow, and usingthe national standard RFQ developed byPrMO.&#13;
&#13;
Direct contracting in accordance with paragraph 3.6 o f the Procurement Guidelines and&#13;
procurement from UNAgencies such as WHO or UNICEF inaccordance with the paragraph 3.9&#13;
o f the Procurement Guidelines may be the appropriate method for procurement o f certain types&#13;
o f goods and services provided that such procurement to be proposed by the project&#13;
implementing agency will meet the conditions as specified in the mentioned respective&#13;
paragraphs. Direct contracting may be used for emergency procurement o f PPE kits that would&#13;
be included ina "positive list" to be defined and agreed inadvance with the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Consulting Services&#13;
Except several consulting services including laboratory construction design and supervision,&#13;
financial management, procurement and independent audit o f project financial statements, the&#13;
IDA Grant is currently not envisaged to fund consulting services. However, it is possiblethat, in&#13;
the event o f changing circumstances, there may be a need for funding consultants from IDA&#13;
resources. Possible areas where consultancy services might be needed include formulating&#13;
guidelines, conducting research, reviewing compensation schemes, reviewing regulatory control&#13;
measures, developing a GIS database to link human cases and animal data, developing a&#13;
communication strategy and plan, developing information, education and communication&#13;
materials, conducting rapid participatory community surveys, database manager, desktop&#13;
pandemic simulation, and reviewing legal decrees and laws related to pandemiddisease&#13;
prevention and control. Most consulting services would be o f small value and to be provided by&#13;
individual consultants. Several consulting services such as construction design and supervision&#13;
or audit may require firms to be selected using Selection based on Consultant Qualification&#13;
(CQS)     In addition, there may be occasion to utilize Single Source Selection (SSS) for&#13;
consultancies of a specialized nature.     Least Cost Selection (LCS) may be appropriate for&#13;
contracting the audit firm.&#13;

                      B. PROCUREMENT CAPACITY ASSESSMENT&#13;
&#13;
A procurement capacity assessment was conducted during the project appraisal. The&#13;
procurement capacity o f the proposed project implementing agencies (NAHICO, MOH and&#13;
MAF)was found inadequate.&#13;
&#13;
The procurement issues and risks for implementation o f the proposed project are mainly related&#13;
to: (i)&#13;
      inadequate procurement knowledge and experience o f the project implementing agencies;&#13;
(ii)potential heavy workload due to the emergency nature o f the proposed project in addition to&#13;
the workload by potential projects to be funded by other donors; (iii)potential slow&#13;
Government's internal procurement approval process; and (iv) potential abuse o f shopping and&#13;
statement o f expenditures procedures.&#13;
&#13;
Action plan for strengthening the procurement capacity o fthe project implementing agencies&#13;
agreed duringthe appraisal:&#13;
&#13;
         1. NAHICO will provide a detailed Procurement Plan for the first 18 o f project&#13;
              implementation to the Bank prior to negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
         2. CDC will issue an instruction on the project procurement work including a&#13;
              simplified Government approval procedure and measures to ensure transparency&#13;
              and economy o f the shopping and statement o f expenditures procedures by the&#13;
              project effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
         3. NAHICO will select a Procurement Consultant by the project effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
         4. CDCIMOH will assign one Procurement Officer to work full time at NAHICO by&#13;
              the project effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
         5. Each participating agency will assign one staff with responsibility for providing&#13;
              NAHICO with technical support for procurement o f their respective sub-project&#13;
              components.&#13;
&#13;
         6. NAHICO will organize a procurement workshop with the Procurement Consultant&#13;
              as the main resource person and with assistance from the Procurement Monitoring&#13;
              Office (PrMO), Ministry o f Finance within one month after the project&#13;
              effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
         7. NAHICO will establish the project procurement record and filing system by the&#13;
              project effectiveness.&#13;

Summaryof the FinancialManagementAssessment&#13;
An assessment o f the project financial management arrangements was carried out bythe Bank's&#13;
financial management team duringproject appraisal inMay 2006. After reviewing the financial&#13;
management capacity o f the principal implementing agencies, an action plan to strengthen the&#13;
project financial management arrangements was agreed with GoL (see below).                With the&#13;
implementation o f the agreed actions as conditions o f effectiveness, and a condition o f&#13;
disbursement for one component, the project financial management arrangements are considered&#13;
adequate to meet the World Bank's minimumrequirements.&#13;
&#13;
CountryIssues&#13;
The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), carried out in mid-2002 concluded&#13;
that the overall fiduciary risk inLao PDR i s considered to be high, despite the fact that there are&#13;
elaborate built-incontrols within the government financial management system. This i s because&#13;
there is insufficient transparency in public finances and the general attitude towards fiscal&#13;
discipline is lax. The budget process i s not yet transparent and public access to government&#13;
financial information i s limited. These weaknesses have been compounded by insufficient&#13;
awareness o f modem practices o f internal control in the public sector and by the government's&#13;
ongoing decentralization initiative, which needs to be supported with a sufficiently robust&#13;
institutional framework that clearly defines the new responsibilities at lower levels. Technical&#13;
capacity o f staff at these levels needs to be strengthened and the oversight functions and the State&#13;
Audit Organization need improvement. A recently completed IDF grant to improve&#13;
accountability in State owned enterprises and the private sector has helped develop the&#13;
environment for the accounting and auditing professions and initiated amendments to accounting&#13;
and auditing laws. A Public Expenditure Review is currently underway.&#13;
&#13;
The recent (November 2005) Joint Portfolio Effectiveness Review (JPER) undertaken by GoL,&#13;
ADB, Sida and WB also identified similar issues and weaknesses and agreed to implement a&#13;
series o f remedial measures in a time bound action plan., including: (i)    delegation o f authority&#13;
over the management o f project special accounts to executing agencies that have in place&#13;
adequate quality and control systems; (ii)   streamlining of approval processes; (iii)harmonization&#13;
o f a financial management manual; (iv) utilization o f uniform FM software; (v) consolidation o f&#13;
project FMfunctions; and (vi) implementationo f a consolidated training program.&#13;
&#13;
While these actions have started to improve specific fiduciary issues, the country financial&#13;
management environment for externally-funded projects remains weak.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RiskAnalysis&#13;
&#13;
Inherent Risk. Overall inherent risk is considered to be                  due to limited financial&#13;
management capacity, skills and resources in the country. Audit and internal controls are weak.&#13;
These weaknesses contribute to levels o f corruptionbeingperceived as high.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   39&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Control Risk. Overall control risk at the project level i s substantial due to lack o f adequate&#13;
financial systems and capacity, but i s considered to be reduced to moderate after&#13;
implementationo fthe risk mitigation measuresdescribed below.&#13;

Strengths and Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
Strengths.     The main project implementing agencies in the MAF and M o H have capable&#13;
financial management units which can contribute to successful project implementation. The&#13;
financial unit in the DLF in MAF has experienced staff accustomed to dealing with donor&#13;
financed projects.     The PMU in the M o H handling the IDA financed Health Services&#13;
Improvement Project also has developed financial management capacity which can be made&#13;
available to the AH1 project as needed in an advisory capacity. It will assist in preparing the&#13;
project Financial Management Manual andthe InterimFinancialReport formats.&#13;

Limited experience and capacity in project FM for all components, except component&#13;
financial    management       under    IDA 1, will be centralized in NAHICO and&#13;
procedures at each participating agency       technical assistance and training will be&#13;
                                              provided under the financial management&#13;
                                              contract for NAHICO and for DLF, which&#13;
                                              will implement component 1.&#13;
&#13;
Implementing Entity&#13;
&#13;
The overall coordination of project implementation will be the responsibility o f NAHICO.&#13;
Implementation responsibilitieswill be as follows:&#13;
    0   Component 1will be implemented by the Department o f Livestock and Fisheries (DLF)&#13;
        inthe Ministry ofAgriculture andForestry.&#13;
    0   Component 2 will be implemented by NAHICO through the Department o f Preventive&#13;
        Health andHygieneinthe Ministry o f Health.&#13;
    0   Component 3 will be implemented by NAHICO through the Department o f Curative&#13;
        Services inMoH.&#13;
    0   Components 4 and 5 will be implemented by NAHICO, in coordination with other&#13;
        Ministries.&#13;
&#13;
NAHICO, which was established by Government decree in May, 2006, has four Units, each o f&#13;
which will be staffed with local personnel seconded from existing Ministries and supported by&#13;
consultants as follows:&#13;
&#13;
        (i)CoordinationUnit;&#13;
        (ii) Financial Management Unit, supported bythree FMconsultants initially;&#13;
        (iii)Monitoringand evaluationUnit, supported by one consultant; and&#13;
        (iv) Procurement Unit, supportedbytwo consultants initially.&#13;
&#13;
The centralization o f financial management and procurement functions within NAHICO,&#13;
supported byprofessional financial consultancy services, is one o fthe key measures taken inthis&#13;
project to mitigate fiduciary risks. NAHICO will carry out all the normal functions o f a project&#13;
implementation unit, including coordination and consolidation o f project budgets; management&#13;
o f the project special account and payments to suppliers; establishment and maintenance o f&#13;
internal control procedures; asset management; and regular accounting and reporting.&#13;
Accounting for component 1activities implementedthrough the sub-project account managed by&#13;
DLF would be undertaken by DLF accounting staff assisted by NAHICO's consultants. DLF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               41&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
accounts will form part o f the consolidated project accounts prepared by NAHICO. Accounting&#13;
for all other components will be undertaken by NAHICO.&#13;
&#13;
Projectfilzancing arrangements&#13;
&#13;
The project is being financed by IDA, AHIF and PHRDFund.&#13;
    0    The PHRD Fundwould finance 100% o f specific identified expenditure categories (viz.,&#13;
         Training and workshops and Consulting services on Components 1and 5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Other expenditure categories would be cofinanced by IDA and AHIF (67% and 33%&#13;
         respectively o f total costs including taxes). Inline with the AHIF agreement, local taxes&#13;
         and duties will not be financed from the AHIF. The financing shares o f IDA and EC of&#13;
         67% and 33% respectively have been determined factoring in that no taxes and duties&#13;
         should be financed from the AHIF (see computation intable below). All taxes and duties&#13;
         on these categories would be financedby IDA.'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The project accounting systemwill recordthe appropriate source o f funding for different&#13;
expenditures, to account and report on their uses by source o f funds. The project financing&#13;
statements and audit would confirm adherence to the stipulated financin shares, thereby also&#13;
confirming that taxes and duties have not been financed from the AHIF.                   B&#13;
&#13;
The table below indicates the amounts allocated and the percentage o f project expenditures&#13;
financedby expenditure category and financing source.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'The  Lao PDR country financing parameters allow for IDA financing o f all taxes and duties. IDA has appraised&#13;
  that taxes and duties do not constitute an excessive share o f project costs (estimated at about 11.8% o fproject&#13;
  expenditures on these categories).&#13;
 These estimatedtaxes have been computed based on the different tax rates applicable to each expenditure category.&#13;
3 For clarity, the Notes to Project Financial Statements would state that the financing shares betweenIDA and AHIF&#13;
  financing stipulated at the beginning have been determined ina manner as to exclude any financing o f taxes and&#13;
  duties from the AHIF; and confirmthat these agreed financing shares have been adhered to, and therefore no taxes&#13;
  and duties have been financed from the AHIF.&#13;

Funds Flow&#13;
&#13;
Fundingfor the project will be derived from three different sources:&#13;
           0   IDA grants, US$4 million;&#13;
               Japanese PHRD grants, US$2 million;&#13;
               Avian and HumanInfluenzaFacility, US$2 million&#13;
&#13;
The grants will be pooled in one designated account with the funds from each source being&#13;
separately identified and accounted for the inthe accounting records and system for the project.&#13;
The project accounting records will match each expenditure, with the appropriate source of&#13;
fundingto account andreport ontheir usesby source o f funds. The project chart of accounts and&#13;
reporting formats will be developed to make this possible.&#13;
&#13;
A U S dollar ($) designated account will be opened and maintained in the Bank o f Lao (BoL),&#13;
managed by the Ministry o f Finance.         To facilitate timely project implementation and&#13;
disbursement, a Sub-project Account in US dollar ($) will be opened and maintained in a&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to IDA, managed by NAHICO. Amounts will be transferred from&#13;
the BoL designated account to the Sub-project account managed by NAHICO as and when&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               43&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
needed.   A second level sub-project account in US$ will be opened and maintained in a&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to IDA and managed by DLF for the implementation o f component&#13;
1. The BoL designated account will have an authorized allocation ofUS$800,000 comprised of:&#13;
IDA Grant $US400,000 PHRD US$200,000 and AHIF US$200,000. The sub-accounts will&#13;
operate on an imprest basis with advance o f funds based on project activity expenditure&#13;
requirements. The NAHICO managed sub-project account will have a ceiling o f US$600,000&#13;
and the DLF managed second level sub-project account, a ceiling o f US$200,000. The flow o f&#13;
funds is shown inthe attachment to this appendix.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Separate withdrawal applications would be submitted for the IDA and AHIF with the required&#13;
reconciliations o f the ledger accounts to the bank account balances. The withdrawal applications&#13;
for the AHIF would indicate that the AHIF financing (33% o f total costs) does not include any&#13;
taxes and duties. The project will use transaction based disbursement procedures, using the&#13;
designated accounts and project accounts for most expenditures, with replenishment on the basis&#13;
o f statements o f expenditures (SOEs).        Direct payment methods may also be used for&#13;
expenditures above the levels for SOEs (see below).&#13;
&#13;
Use of SOEs. Some o f the proceeds o f the grants are expected to be disbursed on the basis o f&#13;
SOEs as follows: (i) work contracts costing less than US$lOO,OOO&#13;
                         civil                                               equivalent each; (ii)&#13;
goods contracts costing less than US$50,000 equivalent each;           (iii)service contracts for&#13;
individual consultants costing less than US$25,000 equivalent each and for firms costing less&#13;
than US$50,000 equivalent each; (iv) training, workshops and study tours; (v) operating costs;&#13;
and (vi) compensation fund and pilot and research hnd expenditures.           Disbursements for&#13;
services and goods exceeding the foregoing limits will be made in accordance with respective&#13;
procurement guidelines and provisions in the Financing Agreement against submission o f full&#13;
documentation and signed contracts.&#13;
&#13;
Staffing&#13;
&#13;
NAHICO will hire a qualified consulting firm to undertake financial management and&#13;
accounting activities and capacity buildingand training amongst local staff. The government has&#13;
nominated designated senior officials to supervise and monitor these critical functions.&#13;
Counterpart financial management staff will be seconded to NAHICO from existing ministerial&#13;
units.  DLF in the MAF already has a complement o f five accounting staff (two senior&#13;
accountants and three assistant accountants) in its accounting units. These staff will receive&#13;
assistance and training in financial management, internal controls and reporting from the&#13;
consulting team to be established inNAHICO.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
&#13;
NAHICO will develop a Financial Management (FM) Manual for the project. The FM manual&#13;
will focus on strengthening controls over requests for expenditure processing and will describe&#13;
and adopt financial policies and procedures for: (i)     reviewing and approving proposals for&#13;
strategy activities; (ii)roles and functional responsibilities; (iii)names and positions o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
authorized signatories in the bank accounts and threshold for delegation o f payment approvals;&#13;
(iv) budgeting; (v) accounting system and financial reporting; (vi) asset management; and (vii)&#13;
all routine financial management and related administrative activities.               The Financial&#13;
Management Manual will be based on the existing FM Manual used by the PMU o f the Health&#13;
Services Improvement Project, which i s satisfactory to IDA. Its preparation and adoption is a&#13;
condition o f effectiveness. The FMmanualwill also include financial policies and procedures to&#13;
be followed by the DLF inimplementation o f component 1.&#13;
&#13;
External Audit&#13;
&#13;
The project financial statements and special accounts will be audited by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA, working to terms o f reference acceptable to IDA.           The audit TOR will&#13;
require the auditor to undertake an annual review o f internal controls in the project.    The audit&#13;
report i s required to be submitted within 6 months after the end o f the fiscal year. As the country&#13;
fiscal year i s ended September 30, the audit reports are therefore due to be submitted by&#13;
March.31 each year. The cost o f audit will be paid out o f project funds as an authorized&#13;
expenditure.&#13;
&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring. Required reports include: (i) Financial Reports (IFR); and (ii)&#13;
                                                           Interim&#13;
Annual audited financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
The interim financial reports (IFRs) are required to be submitted quarterly within 30 days after&#13;
the end o f each quarter. As the IFR will also be used as a monitoring tool, it should report&#13;
project progress with adequate description and explanation and analysis o f variances.           The&#13;
financial statements will include report on sources and uses o f funds, the project financial&#13;
position; project expenditures, physical progress compared with plan; and procurement&#13;
monitoring. The IFRs will not be subject to audit. The format o f the IFRs will be agreed at&#13;
negotiation. The format, which will be based on the existing reports preparedby the HSIP P M U&#13;
inthe M o Hmodified for this project, will report project activities of each strategy andwill link&#13;
the financial information with the project's physical progress. The monitoring and evaluation&#13;
team shall be responsible for ensuring that physical data synchronize with the financial data.&#13;
&#13;
The annual financial statements are subject to be audited annually by external auditor and&#13;
according to audit TOR acceptable to the Bank. The audited statements and audit reports are&#13;
required to be submitted to the Bank within six months after the end o f the fiscal year. The&#13;
format o f annual financial statements will be similar to IFR financial statements.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
1.      EXPERIENCE IN RESPONDING TO AVIAN INFLUENZA OUTBREAKS IN&#13;
        LAO PDR&#13;
&#13;
Inearly 2004, avian influenza (AI)outbreaks occurred inthree provinces ofLao PDR (38 cases&#13;
inVientiane, 5 cases inChampasak, and 2 cases in Savannakhet). O f these 45 cases, 42 cases&#13;
were reported from commercial enterprises and 3 cases were reported from villages).           As a&#13;
result, 155,000 animals died, about 1/3 of which from the disease and 2/3 from culling. It is&#13;
suspected that more outbreaks might have occurred in rural areas, but these have not been&#13;
reported. No human cases o f AI were reported inLao PDR. The procedures usedto respond to&#13;
these outbreaks were as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Use ofpersonalprotection equipment (PPE). PPE was used at farms where AI outbreaks&#13;
        occurred and were suspected to occur (i.e., those farms where poultry was culled). Each&#13;
        worker wore one tyvex suit/day. There was no tyvex suit change ina day as the workers&#13;
        did not leave the work area or took any breaks (e.g., lunchbreak) untilthey finished their&#13;
        daily work. Other PPEused included gloves, masks, andbooths.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Culling of poultw.     At all reported locations, except for one, neck dislocation or&#13;
        placement o f live birds in plastic bags was used as the method for culling o f poultry in&#13;
        Lao PDR. The exception took place at a large commercial farm where culling o f about&#13;
        10,000 poultry was done usingcarbon dioxide (C02) gas.&#13;
&#13;
        Disinfection of-farm surfaces, equipment, materials and wastes. After culling o f poultry,&#13;
        the surfaces and equipment in a farm, poultry manure, bedding material, etc. were&#13;
        sprayed with sodium hypochlorite (NaOC1) as the least expensive disinfectant available&#13;
        inLao PDR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Transportation qf carcasses. Transportation o f animal carcasses or farm waste was not&#13;
        an issue because AI outbreaks occurred at commercial farms. Carcasses were transported&#13;
        bycarts only within the farm site to the burial pit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Disuosal  sfused PPE. Used PPE was put in a plastic bag and then destroyed it in an&#13;
        incinerator at the city. However, incineration o f PPE potentially containing chlorine-&#13;
        based disinfectant spills would likely generate hazardous dioxins and hrans (which&#13;
        would be emitted to the atmosphere).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Disposal of carcasses and farm wastes (e.2. bedding material, manure). Burial was used&#13;
        as the method for disposing of culled poultry. This was done as follows: (i)     a burial pit&#13;
        o f about 2 meters was dug, (ii) bottom o f the pit was covered with lime [Ca (OH)2],&#13;
                                         the&#13;
        (iii)thecarcasseswereplacedontopoflimeforabout 1meterdepth,(iv)alimelayer&#13;
        was spread on top o f carcasses, and (v) the remainder o f the burial pit (less than about 1&#13;
        meter) was closed to ground level with soil.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 48&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     0   Capabilities of veterinaw laboratories. Untilrecently, none o f the veterinary laboratories&#13;
         inLao PDRhad the capacity to detect H5N1, although NAHC were able to detect Type&#13;
         A or B. For this reason, specimens had to be sent abroad (to Thailand and Vietnam) for&#13;
         detection of the H5N1 virus.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0   Capabilities of the national virolom laboratow. As the virology laboratory at NCLE did&#13;
         not have the capability to detect the H5N1virus, the suspected AI samples had to be sent&#13;
         abroad to Japan for testing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0   Measures at hospitals. At selected hospitals, isolation rooms were established to receive&#13;
         AI-infected patient or patients suspected to be AI-infected. However, no such patient&#13;
         was received. There are no respirators inany o f the isolation rooms.&#13;
&#13;
With FAO's technical support and the French Government's financial support, inMarch 2005,&#13;
the Department o f Livestock and Fisheries (DLF) o f MAF published a manual entitled "Basic&#13;
Knowledge about Avian Influenza and How to Prevent It." This manual aims at disseminating&#13;
basic knowledge on AI and prevention methods for agriculturalists, village veterinarians,&#13;
livestock technical officers, and veterinarians as well as other people interested in AI. The&#13;
manual, which contains useful information would benefit from updating, with some&#13;
reorganization based on specific targeted audiences.&#13;
&#13;
The Government o f Lao PDR has established a committee for the communicable diseases from&#13;
14 lines ministries, with MOH and MAF forming the core o f this committee. Within MOH, the&#13;
Department o f Hygiene Prevention worked with the Surveillance Unit for daily reporting o f AI&#13;
cases. Some hospitals have designated isolation rooms (e.g.,                            Mittaphab Hospital and&#13;
Setthathirath Hospital inVientiane) to receive SARS patients, which can now be usedpotentially&#13;
AI-infected patients. Guidelines have been established for personal hygiene and healthcare waste&#13;
management in Lao PDR. However, although the basis o f the solid healthcare waste&#13;
management system is in place (with the three-bin system o f infectious, sharps, and ordinary&#13;
wastes; posters on waste segregation; and some staff training), implementation i s less than&#13;
perfect regarding waste segregation and treatment.' In addition, sewage from hospitals&#13;
(particularly from the isolation rooms) i s not generally treated.&#13;
&#13;
In2005, the Government of LaoPDR set uptheNational Planthat consisted offive strategies:&#13;
&#13;
      1. STRATEGY 1 (Sl) - Development o f a disease-free avian management system (animal&#13;
         aspect)&#13;
      2. STRATEGY 2 (S2)-Disease surveillance and response inhumans duringAI outbreaks&#13;
      3. STRATEGY 3 (S3) - Laboratory and curative care&#13;
      4. STRATEGY 4 (S4)           -  Health education and community action&#13;
      5. STRATEGY 5 (S5) - Strengthening institutional and regulatory frameworks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'For  example, the design o f the incinerator at the Settathirath Hospital does not meet the international standards&#13;
(e.g., does not have a gas washing system). The incinerator is not operatedas planned due to the highfuel cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           49&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In2005, the national committee was upgraded to a higher level chaired by the Prime Minister.&#13;
InJanuary 2006, anationalcoordination committeewas set upwithin theMinistryofHealth.&#13;
&#13;
MAFhas identified the National Animal Health Center (NAHC) inVientiane as the veterinary&#13;
laboratory for AI detection. In addition, one veterinary laboratory in the south (in Champassak&#13;
and/or Savannakhet) and another veterinary laboratory in the north (in Luang Prabang and/or&#13;
Oudomxay) have been designated to collect and ship the AI specimens to NAHC. N A H C has an&#13;
exiting animal laboratory in Vientiane with limited space and capability. Currently, MAF i s&#13;
constructing a new building for NAHC, which i s incomplete. FA0 and OiE have supported&#13;
purchase o f essential equipment required to detect HPAI for NAHC (which were partially&#13;
received), and the laboratory staff has been trained on test methods, personal hygiene, and&#13;
quality assurance (Q/A).&#13;
&#13;
To treat patients potentially infected with AI, MOHhas identified three central and four regional&#13;
hospitals for upgrading. These hospitals are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Eachhospital i s envisioned to have five (5) isolationrooms for the AIpatients.&#13;
&#13;
2.     INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKINLAO PDR&#13;
&#13;
Environmental Management. At the national level, environmental management is under the&#13;
Science, Technology and Environment Agency (STEA), which reports to the Prime Minister's&#13;
office.  STEA has an office in each province (PSTEO), which reports to the provincial&#13;
government. In addition, in various line ministries there are units that deal with environmental&#13;
issues.&#13;
&#13;
Recognizing the cross-sectoral character o f environmental conservation and protection, the Lao&#13;
Government has created multiple coordination bodies to facilitate inter-agency and provincial&#13;
coordination. These include the National Environment Committee (NEC), the Water Resources&#13;
Coordination Committee (WRCC), and the Lao National Mekong Committee (LNMC).&#13;
&#13;
Animal Health Sewices. At the national level, the Ministry o f Agriculture and Forestry (MAF)i s&#13;
responsible for animal health services.          To extend these services, MAF has a network o f&#13;
personnel at the national, professional, and district levels. MAF has also veterinary laboratories,&#13;
including one at the National Animal Health Center (NAHC) in Vientiane and provincial&#13;
veterinary laboratories (e.g., inChampassak, LuangPrabang).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     50&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Ofthe 69 qualified veterinarians inLao PDR, 16 o f them are employed at MAF inVientiane. As&#13;
half o f this staff is to retire within the next three years and there are no universities in Lao PDR&#13;
offering a degree in veterinary sciences, the currently limited professional human capacity in&#13;
animal health services i s expected to reach critical levels if some measures are not taken&#13;
promptly.&#13;
&#13;
Currently, there are 893 Government personnel who are involved in animal production and&#13;
animal disease control programs and responsible for administrating animal health services for&#13;
poultry at the national, provincial, and district levels. There are 785 livestock officers located at&#13;
12 provincial livestock offices. At the community level, there are 5,177 veterinary workers in&#13;
11,180 villages who are administering animal health services for poultry (20 percent); cattle,&#13;
buffalo, pigs (50 percent); and dogs, and cats (30 percent).&#13;
&#13;
Public Health Services. The Ministry o f Health (MOH) is incharge o f human health services in&#13;
Lao PDR. MOH has 5 central hospitals (all in Vientiane), 4 regional hospitals, 16 provincial&#13;
hospitals, 141 district hospitals, and 789 health care centers.             Many health facilities have&#13;
insufficient professional and medical staff, limited drugs and basic equipment, including&#13;
insufficient isolation rooms and inadequate equipment (e.g., ventilators) for patients with severe&#13;
respiratory diseases.      At the community level 14,000 village health volunteers have been&#13;
working on malaria. At the hospitals, the current healthcare waste management practices need&#13;
strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
The public health surveillance i s carried out by the National Center for Laboratory and&#13;
Epidemiology (NCLE) in Vientiane.             NCLE carries out surveillance, case and outbreak&#13;
investigation, response, and research; and serves as the public health laboratory and the national&#13;
reference laboratory. Although AI has not been a reportable disease in Lao PDR, NCLE has&#13;
been receiving support from the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit to implement a computerized&#13;
Early Warning Outbreak Recognition System (EWORS) in four hospitals in Vientiane and three&#13;
hospitals inthree regional hospitals.*&#13;
&#13;
NCLE i s supported by 17 provincial surveillance units (PSU) and 141 district health offices&#13;
(DHO). On the average, each PSU has two to four staff with variable level o f training. Staff at&#13;
D H O are typically not qualified in epidemiology. Some DHOs lack communication devices&#13;
(e.g., telephones, faxes), making it difficult to report health events to the next level in a timely&#13;
manner.&#13;
&#13;
The public health laboratovy structure i s similar to the surveillance system. NCLE acts as the&#13;
public health and national reference laboratory. It has not achieved bio-safety level 2 status and&#13;
currently does not have the capacity to perform AI diagnosis. Suspected AI specimens have to&#13;
be shippedabroad (e.g., Japan) for testing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 EWORSi s a symptom-based hospitalsurveillance system that collects and sends data to NCLE on a daily basis&#13;
from the outpatient and emergency rooms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    51&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 3.    LEGAL FRAMEWORK INLAO PDR&#13;
&#13;
Environmental Aspects.     The Environmental Protection Law o f 1999 and its implementing&#13;
regulation of 2002 are the principal environmental legislation in the country. This legislation&#13;
includes measures for the protection, mitigation and restoration o f the environment as well as&#13;
guidelines for environmental management and monitoring. Other key environmental legislative&#13;
measures in Lao PDR include promulgation of the regulation on Environmental Assessment&#13;
(2000); creation o f an Environment Protection Fund to channel earmarked revenues to&#13;
environmental activities, and decentralizingenvironmental functions to provinces.&#13;
&#13;
Animal Aspects. In 2000, the regulation on Management o f Livestock Productivity (No. 0313),&#13;
sponsored by the MAF, was promulgated. Other key regulatory actions by MAF in the area o f&#13;
avian influenza (AI) include:&#13;
&#13;
    0  Decree o f the Prime Minister regarding animal control in Lao PDR (No. 8 5 P M o f May&#13;
        31,2005).&#13;
    0   Order of the PrimeMinister regarding AI control (No. 0 2 P M dated January 27,2004).&#13;
    0  Decision o f the Prime Minister regarding the policy and measures to help agriculturalists&#13;
        affectedby AI (No. 0 6 P M of March 1,2004).&#13;
    0   Order o f MAF regarding increasing control and prevention against AI (No.&#13;
        0075/MAF.2005 of February2,2005).&#13;
    0   Recommendation o f the Director o f the Department of Livestock and Fisheries regarding&#13;
        implementation o f the Ministerial Order on increasing control and prevention against AI&#13;
        (No. 0024/DLF.2005 o f February 14,2005).&#13;
&#13;
Human Hvniene/Environmental Aspects. In 2001,the Law o f the Hygiene, Disease Prevention,&#13;
andHealth Promotion (No. Ol/NA, April 10/25,2001) sponsoredbythe MOHwas enacted. The&#13;
implementing regulation (No. 1371 o f October 4, 2005) for this law establishes drinking and&#13;
domestic water quality standards. Other hygiene-relatedregulations sponsored by MOH are:&#13;
&#13;
    0   Regulation on healthcare waste management (No. 1706 o f July 20,2004).&#13;
    0   Regulation on hygiene in public areas (No. 1705 o f July 20, 2004) (examples o f topics&#13;
        covered include public sanitary facilities, drainage, garbage control, animal control).&#13;
&#13;
Currently, there are no national safety guidelines for laboratories.&#13;
&#13;
4.      PROJECTOBJECTIVEAND DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
The objective o f this project is to contribute to the National Plan, which aims to minimize the&#13;
threat posed to humans and the poultry sector by avian and humaninfluenza infection and other&#13;
zoonoses in Lao PDR, and to prepare for control and to respond to influenza pandemics and&#13;
other infectious diseases in humans. The design o f the subject project follows exactly the&#13;
Government Strategy for avian influenza (AI). As such, the project consists of the following&#13;
components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  52&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Component 1 - Animal health (Sly.         This component supports prevention, control, and&#13;
        eradication o f HPAIamong the animal population.&#13;
&#13;
        Component 2 - Human health-surveillance and response 62). This component aims to&#13;
        improve disease surveillance andresponse inhumans during AI outbreaks&#13;
&#13;
        Component 3 - Human health         - Laboratory and curative services (S3). This component&#13;
        supports preparation o fthe health system to respond to AI outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;
        Component 4 - Information, education, and communication 64).                   This component&#13;
        supports the activities to plan and carry out a public awareness campaign.&#13;
&#13;
        Component 5 -Program coordination and regulatory framework (S5). This component i s&#13;
        focused primarily on a number o f cross-cutting issues, including support to the National&#13;
        Avian and Human Influenza Coordination Office (NAHICO), which will be responsible&#13;
        for the overall coordination o fthis project.&#13;
&#13;
Each o f Government's five strategies include measures and activities (see Appendix 3 for more&#13;
detail).&#13;
&#13;
5.      APPLICABILITY OF THE BANK'S SAFEGUARDS POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
The project i s not expected to have any large-scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts as it i s&#13;
focused largely on public sector capacity buildingand strengthening readiness for dealing with&#13;
outbreaks o f avian influenza (AI) indomestic poultry as well as preventing or reducing possible&#13;
human infections by strengthening emergency preparedness and response.                 In addition, the&#13;
project design incorporates other beneficial measures such as improved biosecurity in farms and&#13;
live markets, and control o f poultry movement within and across countries.               The project's&#13;
preventive activities (funding o f facilities, equipment, laboratories, procedures, and training&#13;
programs), aimed at improving the effectiveness and safety over the existing the AI practices,&#13;
will have positive humanhealth and environmental impacts. As such the project is assigned an&#13;
Environmental Category B.&#13;
&#13;
The applicability o f the Bank's safeguards policies is discussed below. Insummary, among the&#13;
Bank's safeguards policies, only the policies on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) and&#13;
Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10) are triggered. The project i s being processed under OP 8.50,&#13;
Emergency Recovery Assistance, and the task team has receivedconcurrence from the EAP Vice&#13;
President to delay preparation and disclosure o f the EMP under the exception granted under OP&#13;
4.01, para 12.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01).           The key environmental and personal hygiene&#13;
        issues include: (i)   disease transmission from animals during response to AI outbreaks in&#13;
        the field (e.g., culling o f poultry; selection o f appropriate disinfectants for disinfection o f&#13;
        contaminated farm areas; transportation o f farm wastes and carcasses (if necessary);&#13;
        management and disposal o f farm wastes, animal carcasses and used PPE; and packaging&#13;
        and shipment o f specimens);       (ii)management ofwastes andpersonalhygieneat the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    53&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  laboratory o f the National Animal Health Center (NAHC); (iii)       management o f wastes&#13;
  and personal hygiene at hospitals to be receiving potentially AI-infected patients and at&#13;
  the laboratory o f the National Center for Laboratory and Epidemiology (NCLE); and (iv)&#13;
  civil works (completion of the construction of the NAHC building and the upgrading of the&#13;
  existing laboratory at NCLE).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0 NaturalHabitats (OP 4.04). This Bankpolicy i s not triggeredbecause the project will not&#13;
  convert or degrade any protected areas, known natural habitats, or established or&#13;
  proposedcritical natural habitats as defined under the policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0 Pest Management (OP 4.09). This Bank policy i s not applicable because the project will&#13;
  not procure pesticides nor will increase use o f pesticides will result from the project.&#13;
  However, the chemicals to be used for the disinfection o f farm facilities/personal&#13;
  protection equipment will be evaluated on a case by case basis for conformity with the&#13;
  OP 4.09 for Pest Management. The selected disinfectants will conform to the Bank's&#13;
  Pest Management Policy. Use o f hazardous disinfectants would necessitate providing&#13;
  training insafe transport, handling, and application.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0 Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11). This Bank policy i s not triggered because the&#13;
  project will not affect sites with archeological, paleontological, historical, religious, or&#13;
  unique natural values in the project area. However, appropriate clauses will be included&#13;
  in all construction contracts regarding the procedures to be followed in the event of&#13;
  chance find o f culturally significant artifacts or sites.&#13;
&#13;
0 Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10). This Bank policy applies because the indigenous peoples,&#13;
  who form the poorest sector o f the population in Lao PDR, would be most vulnerable to&#13;
  loss o f poultry and the income derived from it. Accordingly, an ethnic group policy&#13;
  framework (EGPF) has been developed outlining the principles to be used for project&#13;
  activities that might take place in indigenous communities. A communication strategy&#13;
  has been incorporated into project design to address concerns about any large-scale&#13;
  project activities and to disseminate information in local languages and in culturally&#13;
  appropriate and accessible ways.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0 Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). This Bank policy is not triggered as no involuntary&#13;
  land acquisition or displacement o f people i s expected under the project (however,&#13;
  compensation o f farmers for the loss o f poultry has been incorporated into the project&#13;
  design).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0 Forestry (OP 4.36). This Bank policy i s not triggered because the project will not involve&#13;
  significant conversion or degradation o f critical forest areas or related critical natural&#13;
  habitats as defined under the policy. The project will not involve significant conversion&#13;
  or degradation of critical forest areas or related critical natural habitats as defined under&#13;
  the policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0 Safety o f Dams (OP 4.37). This Bank policy i s not triggered because the project will not&#13;
  construct or rehabilitate large dams as defined under this policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             54&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    0  International Waterways (OP 7.50). This Bank policy i s not triggered because there are&#13;
       no known project components involving international waterways as defined under the&#13;
       policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  Disputed Areas (OP 7.60). This Bank policy is not triggered because there are no known&#13;
       project components involving international waterways as defined under the policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  Public Disclosure (BP 17.50). Because the project is being processed under OP 8.50,&#13;
       Emergency Recovery Assistance, safeguards issues will be addressed through the use o f&#13;
       accepted good practice and sound design principles. Safeguards documents will not be&#13;
       prepared prior to appraisal. The draft documents will be disclosed as they are prepared&#13;
       and again when they are finalized.&#13;
&#13;
6. ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS AND MITIGATORY&#13;
    MEASURESTO BEADDRESSED UNDERTHE PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
The project is not expected to have any large-scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts as it is&#13;
focused largely on public sector capacity building and strengthening readiness for dealing with&#13;
outbreaks o f avian influenza (AI) in domestic poultry as well as preventing or reducing possible&#13;
human infections by strengthening emergency preparedness and response. In addition, the&#13;
project design incorporates other beneficial measures such as improved biosecurity in farms and&#13;
live markets, and control o f poultry movement within and across countries.           The project's&#13;
preventive activities (funding o f facilities, equipment, laboratories, procedures, and training&#13;
programs), aimed at improving the effectiveness and safety over the existing the AI practices,&#13;
will have positive human health and environmental impacts. As such the project is assigned an&#13;
Environmental Category B.&#13;
&#13;
The potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures to be addressed under this project&#13;
are described below and summarized in Table 1. All o f these mitigation measures have been&#13;
incorporatedinto the design o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
Component 1: Animal Health. The main environmental and personal hygiene issues under&#13;
Component 1o fthe project are associated with the:&#13;
&#13;
    1.     Completion o fthe construction o fthe National Animal Health Center building&#13;
    2.     Personal hygiene at the animal laboratory ofthe National Animal Health Center&#13;
    3.     Management o f wastes generated at the animal laboratory o f National Animal Health&#13;
           Center&#13;
    4.     Response to AI outbreaks by veterinarians and livestock officers.&#13;
&#13;
1.     Completion o f the construction o f the National Animal Health Center Building.&#13;
Construction o f the N A H C buildingwill be completed under hnds provided through the subject&#13;
project. The new buildingwill provide additional space for NAHC. The adverse impacts during&#13;
construction would include dust and noise emissions, generation o f construction waste,&#13;
disturbance o f traffic, and discharge o f untreated sewage.      These adverse impacts will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                55&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
mitigated by including in the construction contract a clause regarding observation o f standards&#13;
for good constructionpractices.&#13;
&#13;
2.     Personal hygiene at the animal laboratory o f the National Animal Health Center. The&#13;
project will not address this issue as the staff at the animal laboratory o f N A H C staff has been&#13;
trained by FA0 on test methods, personal hygiene, and quality assurance; and staff straining will&#13;
continue under another project implemented by FAO.&#13;
&#13;
3.     Management o f wastes generated at the animal laboratory o f the National Animal Health&#13;
Center. The project will not provide any funds in this area as the infectious wastes-sharps&#13;
generated at the animal laboratory o f N A H C are properly managed. This involves collection o f&#13;
the infectious wastes-sharps separately from common wastes, on-site treatment o f these wastes&#13;
by autoclaving, and collection o f the treated wastes along with garbage by the municipality for&#13;
disposal. Procurement o f another autoclave may become necessary if the existing treatment&#13;
capacity i s exceeded from infectious wastes generated as a result o f the analysis o f potential AI&#13;
samples. Inthis case, OiE has committed funds to procure such an autoclave.&#13;
&#13;
4. Response to AI outbreaks by the veterinarians and livestock officers.           The information&#13;
contained in the Department o f Lifestock and Fisheries (DLF) manual will be updated for&#13;
different audiences, including: (i)  veterinarians and livestock officers, (ii) commercial farm&#13;
                                                                               the&#13;
owners, (iii) backyard farm owners, and (iv) the general public. The manual for the veterinarians&#13;
and livestock officers will be presented in the form o f Standard Operating Procedures. This&#13;
manual will address, at a minimum, the following issues:&#13;
&#13;
    (i)     Packaging and shipment of animal specimens.           It is important that the animal&#13;
            specimens be packaged and shipped insuch a manner to avoid spread o f AI. Animal&#13;
            specimens will be shipped for analysis at the National Animal Health Center (NAHC)&#13;
            in Vientiane. The IATA Regulations for packaging of biological specimen will be&#13;
            adopted and included inthe SOPS.&#13;
&#13;
    (ii)    Culling ofpoultry. It i s important that culling o f poultry be conducted in a humane,&#13;
            safe, and efficient manner. The following methods for culling poultry were identified&#13;
            from the OiE/FAO guidelines: (i)     neck breaking (manual), (ii) cutting (using&#13;
                                                                                 neck&#13;
            mechanical devices), (iii) gassing with inhalation agents (e.g., carbon dioxide), and&#13;
            (iv) culling following electrocution or poisoning.         Based on consideration for&#13;
            humane, safe and efficient culling and experience from the previous AI outbreaks in&#13;
            Lao PDR, the following methods were selected for this project: neck breaking for&#13;
            backhouse farming, and use o f carbon dioxide inhalation for commercial farms with&#13;
            large numbers o f poultry. The SOPs will specify the criteria for using one versus the&#13;
            other method; and will provide the design and operating requirements on o f the&#13;
            gassing systems (e.g., specific locations and quantities o f stocked carbon dioxide).&#13;
&#13;
    (iii)   Selection of disinfectants. It is important that the disinfectants to be selected for the&#13;
            disinfection o f farm surfaces, equipment, materials, and wastes do not have adverse&#13;
            impact on human health and the environment. The selection o f disinfectants in this&#13;
            project will be based on such criteria as impacts o f disinfectants on human health and&#13;
            the environment, and availability and cost o f disinfectant in Lao PDR, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  56&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
compatibility o f the disinfectants with the disposal methods o f the wastes. The&#13;
selected disinfectant, which will comply with the Bank's Pest Management Policy&#13;
(OP4.09), will be specified inthe SOPs.&#13;
&#13;
Disinfection of farm surfaces, equipment, materials, and wastes. Based on selected&#13;
disinfectant, the type o f equipment and procedures for preparing (e.g., dilution with&#13;
water) and applying the disinfectant will be specified inthe SOPs.&#13;
&#13;
Disposal of carcasses and farm wastes. It i s important that the selected disposal&#13;
method does not have adverse impacts on human and the environment. For example,&#13;
improper burial practices may cause contamination o f ground or surface water, and&#13;
poorly designed and/or operated cremation or incineration systems may create&#13;
particulate emissions and objectionable odors to neighbors. The following options for&#13;
the disposal o f poultry carcasses and farm wastes were considered: (i)      burial ina pit;&#13;
(ii)open air burning (cremation); (iii)composting; (iv) incineration at a fixed&#13;
location; and (iv) mobile incineration. Incineration (mobile or at a fixed location)&#13;
was eliminated based on cost considerations. Among the remaining options, based on&#13;
experience from the previous AI outbreaks in Lao PDR, burial was selected as the&#13;
disposal method. However, criteria will be developed and included in the SOPs for&#13;
the applicability o f this disposal option for specific sites. This criteria will include: (i)&#13;
height o f the water table (the base o f the burial pit must be at least 1meter above the&#13;
water table); (ii) dry weather conditions (dry season); (iii)    distance to watercourses,&#13;
bores and wells; (iv) slope o f the land at the burial site to the nearest watercourse&#13;
(drainage to and from the pit); (v) type o f soil (or soil permeability); (vi) distance to&#13;
human settlements and public lands (including roads), (vii) prevailing wind direction&#13;
(for odor emissions); (viii) availability o f space for temporary storage o f excavated&#13;
soil; and (viii) accessibility o f burial site by digging equipment (e.g., excavator). For&#13;
those situations where the burial criteria are not met (wet weather conditions, high&#13;
water table), the SOPs will specify the most appropriate, environmentally-safe and&#13;
cost-effective disposal option for Lao PDR. The SOPs will provide detailed design&#13;
(deptho fthe pit), construction and operating requirements (how the pit will be filled).&#13;
&#13;
Disposal of Used PPE. It is important that the selected PPE and disinfectant be&#13;
compatible with the disposal method o f the PPE to avoid generation of hazardous&#13;
wastes.    Based on experience in Lao PDR, used PPE will be incinerated.                  As&#13;
incineration o f chlorine-bearing material with organics might generate emissions o f&#13;
dioxins and furans, care will be exercised inselecting PPE and disinfectants. First o f&#13;
all, all PPE procured under this project will be chlorine-free. Inaddition, best effort&#13;
will be made to select a chlorine-free disinfectant. However, if this is not possible,&#13;
then before incineration, used PPEs will be washed before incineration and the&#13;
washed water needs to be disinfected and waited before discharge. The SOPs will&#13;
describe these procedures indetail.&#13;
&#13;
Transportation of animal carcasses and farm wastes ($ necessay).                    If proper&#13;
measures are not taken, transportation o f AI infected animal carcasses and farm&#13;
wastes would likely spread the virus outside o f the infected farm areas. Under this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        57&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            project, transportation o f carcassesand farm wastes to another site for disposal will be&#13;
            avoided to the maximum extent possible. However, iftransportation i s required, then&#13;
            the SOPs will specify the specific requirements for vehicle design and operation as&#13;
            well as containment o f carcasses and farm wastes for transportation. These SOPs will&#13;
            also include decontamination o fvehicle surfaces (e.g., tires) prior to exiting the farm.&#13;
&#13;
    (viii) Personal hygiene. If proper hygiene measures are not taken, AI may spread to&#13;
            human. For this reason, for each o f the above-mentioned activities to be conducted&#13;
            during AI outbreaks, the SOPs will specify the level of protection (e.g., gloves,&#13;
            masks, overalls, boots) to be used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Component 2: Human Health - Surveillance and Response. N o environmental or personal&#13;
hygiene issues are anticipated.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3:          Human Health - Laboratory and Curative Services.                    The main&#13;
environmental andpersonalhygiene issues under Component 3 o fthe project are:&#13;
&#13;
    1. Personal hygiene at hospitals.&#13;
    2. Healthcare waste management at hospitals to be receiving potentially AI-infected&#13;
        patients.&#13;
    3, Immediate measures for healthcare waste management at central andprovincial hospitals.&#13;
    4. Upgrading o f the existing laboratory at N C L E (iffunded).&#13;
    5. Health laboratory-relatedpersonal hygiene measures.&#13;
    6. Waste management at the NCLE laboratory.&#13;
&#13;
1.      Personal hygiene at hospitals. Ifproper hygiene measures are not taken, AI may spread&#13;
to humans. For this reason, guidelines regarding personal hygiene procedures will be developed&#13;
at central, provincial, and district hospitals as well as community health centers. In addition,&#13;
3,150 PPE to health staff will be provided to the healthcare staff at all levels. Staff from six&#13;
central hospitals in Vientiane, four regional hospitals, 13 provincial hospitals, 141 district&#13;
hospitals as well as health care centers will be trained on these guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Healthcare waste management at hospitals to be receiving potentially AI-infected&#13;
patients. AI virus may spread to humans ifproper waste management measures are not taken at&#13;
hospitals treating potentially AI-infected patients. Under this project, three hospitals at the&#13;
central and four hospitals at the regional/provincial level have been designated to receive AI&#13;
infected (or potentially AI infected) patients.     This subcomponent aims at instituting proper&#13;
waste management procedures at each o fthese hospitals. The main activities will include:&#13;
&#13;
    (i)     Consulting sewices for determining waste quantities by type (especially infectious&#13;
            wastes and sharps), selecting the optimum technology for infectious waste treatment&#13;
            through evaluation o f alternatives (autoclave, microwave, incineration) and providing&#13;
            the specifications o f the selected technology, identifying and providing a conceptual&#13;
            design for the sewage treatment system for the isolation rooms, and preparing&#13;
            detailed healthcare waste management plan for each o f the seven hospitals. A waste&#13;
            treatment system will be installed at each o f the four regional/provincial hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  58&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
           However for the three hospitals in Vientiane, the consultant will evaluate the&#13;
           optimum arrangement for waste treatment (the treatment equipment located at each&#13;
           hospital versus at one hospital receiving also the infectious wastes from the two other&#13;
           hospitals transported by means o f a van). In addition, the consultant services will&#13;
           include the design o f the sewage treatment (disinfection) system for the isolation&#13;
           rooms at each o fthe seven hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
    (ii) Healthcare waste management investment. This will include procurement and&#13;
           installation o f the solid waste treatment technology at each o f the regional/provincial&#13;
           hospital and the recommended system in Vientiane [one, two or three treatment&#13;
           equipment, based on the findings from (i)].      Training o f the operating staff at each&#13;
           hospital will be provided by the equipment supplier. Inaddition, in case o f common&#13;
           waste treatment inVientiane, a waste transport van will be procured. Equipment and&#13;
           supplies (trolleys, containers, bins, plastic bags, labels) for each o f the seven hospitals&#13;
           will also be procured. Inaddition, the sewage treatment (disinfection) system for the&#13;
           isolation rooms at each o f the seven hospitals will be procured and installed.&#13;
&#13;
    (iii)  Consulting services for healthcare waste management training to the local trainers as&#13;
           well as the staff o f the seven hospitals.      The local trainers will be training the&#13;
           healthcare staff for the subsequent years.&#13;
&#13;
    (iv)   Procurement of consumables. The project will fund operating costs for the waste&#13;
           management system at each o f the seven hospitals. These will include fuel for the&#13;
           waste transport van, steam (for the autoclave technology) and electricity for the&#13;
           treatment technology, and supplies (e.g., bags, plastic labels).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Inaddition, the consultant will evaluate if it is feasible to treat the infectious wastes generated&#13;
from NCLE at one o f the hospitals inVientiane.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Immediate measures for healthcare waste management at central and provincial hospitals.&#13;
This activity focuses on only the "immediate" measures for healthcare waste management until&#13;
the system covered under the previous activity (item no. 2) i s established. This activity involves&#13;
provision o fmaterials and supplies (containers, bags, labels) to implement the existing healthcare&#13;
waste management guidelines inLao PDR.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Upgrading o f the existing laboratory at NCLE (if funded). Ifthis activity i s funded, the&#13;
adverse impacts during construction (e.g., dust, noise, management o f construction waste,&#13;
disturbance o f traffic, water supply, sewage management) will be mitigated by including in the&#13;
construction contract a clause regarding observation o f standards for good construction practices.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Health laboratorv-relatedpersonalhygiene measures. Ifproper hygienemeasures are not&#13;
taken, AI may spread to humans. For this reason, SOPS will be prepared for the collection,&#13;
handling, and transportation o f suspected AI specimens to the NCLE laboratory as well as&#13;
handling o f these specimens at the NCLE laboratory. In addition, PPE will be procured and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  59&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
supplied to the staff collecting, handling, and analyzing the suspected AI specimens. Training&#13;
andthen refresher training courses will be givento the staff onpersonal hygienemeasures.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Waste management at the NCLE laboratory.             Currently infectious wastes from the&#13;
serology/virology, bacteriology and toxicology laboratories o f NCLE are collected separately&#13;
from the garbage and treated on site by autoclaving. The treated wastes and garbage are stored&#13;
inan open-top basket and collectedby the municipality twice a week for disposal. As the same&#13;
autoclave i s currently used for the disinfection o f laboratory glassware as well, NCLE i s in need&#13;
o f treatment o f infectious wastes and glassware in separate equipment.        This need will be&#13;
addressedunder the subject project.&#13;
&#13;
This activity will be conducted jointly with the above-mentioned item (no. 2) on healthcare&#13;
waste management in hospitals.       Accordingly, a consultant will be engaged to identify the&#13;
quantity o f infectious waste generated from the NCLE laboratory (currently estimated to be&#13;
about 0.15 m3/day) (and the three hospitals in Vientiane).            The consultant will evaluate&#13;
alternative options for waste management (joint treatment with the hospital wastes in Vientiane&#13;
or a dedicated treatment system at the NCLE laboratory) and devise an optimum scheme. The&#13;
consultant will prepare a waste management plan for the N C L E laboratory solid (this plan will&#13;
address all waste types, including infectious wastes, sharps, liquidwastes, and common wastes).&#13;
If a dedicated infectious waste treatment system at the NCLE laboratory is found to be the&#13;
optimum solution, then this treatment system will be procured and installed at the NCLE&#13;
laboratory (otherwise the wastes will be transported to the hospital that will have the common&#13;
treatment system). In addition, various supplies (e.g., bins, bags, labels) will be procured. The&#13;
NCLE staffwill be provided training on waste management.&#13;
&#13;
Component4: Information,Education,and Communication. N o environmental or personal&#13;
hygiene issues are anticipated.&#13;
&#13;
Component 5: Program Coordinationand RegulatoryFramework. Stockpiling o f PPE to&#13;
the frontline workers as well central- and provincial-level M O H and MAF workers who are&#13;
involved in the management o f AI outbreaks i s envisaged. However, no environmental issues&#13;
are anticipated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

8. CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE OF THE PROJECT'S ENVIRONMENTAL&#13;
   MANAGEMENT PLAN&#13;
&#13;
This Environmental Management Plan has been consulted with the representatives o f the&#13;
Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF). Upon establishment o f&#13;
the National Avian Influenza Coordination Office (NAHICO), this EnvironmentalManagement&#13;
Plan will also be consulted with other participating Government agencies (e.g., Ministry o f&#13;
Information and Communication, Ministry o f Justice, Ministry o f Foreign Affairs, and the&#13;
Science, Technology and Environment Agency (STEA), the commercial poultry association,&#13;
mass organizations (youth, trade, and women's unions),            and other non-governmental&#13;
organizations (NGOs).       The draft Environmental Management Plan will be finalized upon&#13;
incorporation o f comments by these NGOs. The finalized Environmental Management Planwill&#13;
be disclosed at publicly accessible locations inLao PDRand at InfoShop inWashington.&#13;
&#13;
9.   REPORTING            ON     THE      IMPLEMENTATION             PROGRESS       OF    THE&#13;
     PROJECT'SMITIGATIONAND MONITORINGMEASURES&#13;
&#13;
Procedures for providing information on the progress of project implementation and results of&#13;
mitigation and monitoring measures have been structured to facilitate project supervision and&#13;
review. Accordingly, NAHICO will receive biannual progress reports from MAF and MOH on&#13;
the implementation o f various activities under this EMP. After compilation o f these reports,&#13;
NAHICO will submit a biannual report to all international implementing agencies. The biannual&#13;
reports will indicate the activities conducted, the remaining activities to be conducted, the&#13;
products generated, the major issues encountered and how these issues have been resolved as&#13;
well as the outstanding issues, the expenditures in comparison with the budget. NAHICO will&#13;
also submit a copy of the EMP-relatedspecific activity reports (e.g., the waste management plan)&#13;
to the international implementing agency (e.g., World Bank) for review, comments, and no&#13;
objection (if satisfactory).&#13;

Social Analysis and Mitigation&#13;
&#13;
Project Beneficiaries&#13;
Project activities will cover all o f Lao PDR, however, some activities will focus on three&#13;
Provinces (Vientiane, Savanakhet and Champasack) with highrisks due to the concentration o f&#13;
poultry production in these. The Project will benefit commercial poultry farmers and industries&#13;
in these Provinces in improving their poultry management practices to reduce the risk of an&#13;
outbreak o f avian influenza.       Backyard farmers and fighting cock producers in the three&#13;
Provinces will also be targeted for training in bio-security improvements. Many o f these are&#13;
poor farmers living subsistence based livelihoods, including ethnic groups. Women play a key&#13;
role inthe backyardpoultry sector as they are often responsible for poultry production and obtain&#13;
food products and income from their poultry flocks.          A national campaign will provide&#13;
information and educate farmers as well as the general public about the risks o f avian influenza.&#13;
This IEC campaign will be designed to take into account the diverse stakeholders and&#13;
characteristics o f the three sectors covered (commercial, backyard and fighting cock production).&#13;
Multiple media tools will be used and relevant campaign material will be translated into key&#13;
ethnic minority languages.&#13;
&#13;
Commercial and backyardpoultry farmers will benefit from the establishment o f a Compensation&#13;
Fund, which will provide compensation incases o f avian influenza outbreaks that lead to deaths&#13;
and/or culling o f poultry. The Project will undertake assessmentsto evaluate the best options for&#13;
compensation schemes and criteria.&#13;
&#13;
Key beneficiaries o f the Project will be government agencies and staff, particularly in the&#13;
agricultural and health sectors.       These will benefit from training exercises, institutional&#13;
strengthening and enhanced management practices. The general population o f the Lao PDR will&#13;
benefit from enhanced institutional set-up, management practices and awareness concerning&#13;
poultry production and the health sector.       The risk for an outbreak o f avian influenza and&#13;
subsequent pandemic will be minimized and the ability o f key stakeholders (e.g., health&#13;
practitioners andpoultry farmers) to address a possible outbreak andpandemic will be enhanced.&#13;
&#13;
Consultations&#13;
Consultations have been held with a large number o f government representatives in the&#13;
respective sectors receiving support under the Project. These consultations have taken place at&#13;
national as well as provincial levels. MAFhas held consultations with commercial and backyard&#13;
poultry farmers concerning measures to avoid and address outbreaks o f avian influenza.&#13;
Feedback from these consultations has been incorporated into the Lao PDR Government's&#13;
strategy supported by the Project. Further consultations and IEC campaigns will be undertaken&#13;
with various stakeholders during implementation, including commercial and backyard poultry&#13;
farmers.&#13;

Consultations with civil society&#13;
With the establishment o fNAHICO, the Environmental Management Plan and the Ethnic Group&#13;

&#13;
Consultationswith beneficiariesandNGOs,and/or their involvementin implementation&#13;
There are no particular civil society stakeholders specifically for the poultry sector in the Lao&#13;
PDR. However, many development NGOs in Lao PDR work with poor farmers, including&#13;
activities supporting small livestock such as poultry. NGOs will be an important target group for&#13;
increasing their awareness o f national policy and measures to address the risk o f avian influenza.&#13;
They will thus be consulted duringimplementation. Mass based organizations will participate in&#13;
project implementation, mainly with respect to the IEC campaign under Component 4. District&#13;
and village facilitators will be trained and participate in implementing the public information&#13;
campaign.&#13;
&#13;
Resettlement&#13;
N o land acquisition or resettlement will take place under the Project. Compensation for loss o f&#13;
poultry due to avian influenza will be provided under the Project, with the criteria and&#13;
mechanism for providing such compensation to be designed duringProject implementation.&#13;
&#13;
IndigenousPeople&#13;
The Project does not affect ethnic groups adversely. However, Project activities will take place&#13;
in all areas o f the country and ethnic groups will benefit from an enhanced understanding o f&#13;
avian influenza, o f ways to improve bio-security, o f measures to be taken in case o f outbreaks,&#13;
and from the compensation for loss o f poultry due to an outbreak. The IEC campaign will be&#13;
designed to ensure it i s appropriate for the diverse ethnic population in the Lao PDR; the&#13;
campaign will be translated into ethnic languages. An Ethnic Group Planning Framework has&#13;
beenprepared.&#13;

Key institutions responsible for preparationo fthe project: NAHICO, MOH, MAF and&#13;
other relevant ministries and stakeholders. The project i s also closely coordinated with&#13;
activities carried out by UNagencies working on AHI.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation reviews of the Government's plan will be undertaken on a bi-annual&#13;
basis, with the participation o f all the partners who are providing support to the Plan.&#13;
This approach is particularly important since, except in the case o f the IEC component,&#13;
there are a number o f partners supporting interlinking activities within each component&#13;
(or strategy). The indicators prepared during the appraisal, which were agreed to by the&#13;
financing partners and the Government, will form the basis for evaluating.            These&#13;
implementation reviews will provide an opportunity for joint reviews and for making&#13;
adjustments to the Plan based on the situation on the ground.          The conduct o f joint&#13;
implementation reviews should reduce the burden which would result through separate&#13;
reviews by financiers o f activities which they are financing.       These implementation&#13;
reviews will be coordinatedjointly between the AH1Coordination Office inUNDP, and&#13;
the World Bank Country Office, with the former responsible for ensuring that the&#13;
proposed timing o f the reviews i s convenient for NAHICO, the partners, and World&#13;
Bank.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
1. HumanHealth:Lao PDRhas apopulationo f 5.6 million, with 79.8 percent living in&#13;
rural areas. In spite o f the progress made in recent years, health status indicators&#13;
demonstrate that the population remains affected by significant health problems.&#13;
Disparities between urban and rural social indicators are profound. Fertility rates per&#13;
1,000 women aged 15- 19 vary from 1 15 inrural areas to 49 inurban areas, while births&#13;
attended by skilled birth attendants range from 11.6 percent inrural areas to 63.4 percent&#13;
in urban areas. Infant mortality can be directly related to these indicators with Infant&#13;
MortalityRates (IMR) over twice as highinrural areas as inurban areas. Infant mortality&#13;
and maternal mortality continue to be among the highest in the region. From 1990 to&#13;
2000, maternal mortality remained stable. Infant mortality decreased over the same&#13;
period, but at a rate slower than i s necessary; Lao PDR needs to reduce its IMR by 4.4&#13;
percent annually to meet the MDG o f a 2/3 reduction in infant mortality by 2015. From&#13;
1990 to 2002, Lao averaged a 2.7 percent reductionper year ininfant mortality.&#13;
&#13;
2. Background,Lao PDR Poultry Sector:The sector comprises mainly o f smallholders&#13;
raising free-range, local chicken for meat and eggs, for consumption or for local sale.&#13;
"An average village has around 350 chickens, ducks, turkeys and quail being raised in&#13;
small flocks interspersed among village homes by about 78 families, with women&#13;
primarily responsible for the flocks. Ducks, turkey, and quail are also raised, with&#13;
negligible amounts o f geese found scattered around the country. The few commercial&#13;
operations (less than 100 intotal, with 89 o f these located near Vientiane) inthe country&#13;
supply nearby metropolitan areas. It is estimated that less than 25 percent o f all poultry&#13;
production i s produced on the commercial farms"'. Most o f the commercial production i s&#13;
for domestic consumption, with local (native) chickens accounting for 87 percent o f total&#13;
production, ducks next at 9 percent, followed by commercial breeds o f layers andbroilers&#13;
at 2 percent each. There are some smaller commercial operations (from 100birds or more&#13;
to a maximum o f 10,000 birds) o f broilers or layers, mostly clustered in the Vientiane&#13;
city area. Savannakhet and Champasak are the other two major production areas.&#13;
Estimates o f the total poultry population vary, with that for 2005 at 20 million birds,&#13;
heavily concentrated in Vientiane, Savannakhet, and Champasak Provinces. Biosecurity&#13;
and technology utilization are minimal, with little available veterinary care from either&#13;
private or Government sources.&#13;
&#13;
3. Highly PathogenicAvian Influenza in Lao PDR: "The initial assessment o f losses&#13;
due to HPAI identified 50,670 dead birds. The Lao Government's stamping out efforts&#13;
culled another 100,250 birds on 39 commercial operations inthe Vientiane area and three&#13;
others in Champasak and Savannakhet provinces. Economic impacts were most severely&#13;
felt by the commercial broiler operations and some quail farms, mostly due to market&#13;

inactivity after the initial culling efforts. Restocking efforts varied, with commercial&#13;
farms taking between two to eight months to fully restock, after receiving some&#13;
assistance from the Lao Government and FAO. It was reported that some farms in&#13;
Champasak province were restocked with chicks from Thailand, in spite o f the ban on&#13;
imports. Some producers switched completely away from poultry into fish farming,&#13;
cattle, and hog prod~ction"~.The total lost poultry was worth approximately $0.32&#13;
million if valued using an average o f 2004 poultry prices. In addition the MAF estimated&#13;
that the cost o f investigation, response, and management o f the outbreaks was US$4&#13;
million. [Also see: Appendix 11. Future outbreaks remain possible as the disease&#13;
circulates among birds in neighboring countries. Given the concentration o f poultry&#13;
farming in three provinces (Vientiane, Champansek, and Savannakhet) any future avian&#13;
outbreaks o f H5N1may rapidly put a significant portion o fthe flock at risk.&#13;
&#13;
4. The objective o f this economic analysis is, first, to provide a justification for&#13;
government, World Bank and other partners' intervention in this area. The main factors&#13;
considered are the project correction for market failure and meeting o f society's equity&#13;
objectives. Second, given that government intervention i s justified, we analyze whether&#13;
the Program's social benefits outweigh the social costs. Ingeneral, the uncertainty in the&#13;
risk o f further HPAIoutbreaks amongbirds and o f a potential humanpandemic makes it&#13;
difficult to prepare empirically based cost-benefit analysis or cost-effectiveness analysis.&#13;
What we have attempted here is to provide order o fmagnitude estimates o f the Program's&#13;
economic benefits in relation to its costs as an approximate `benefit-to-cost ratio'. Any&#13;
rigorous quantitative analysis beyond this is not possible due to the lack o f (i) on&#13;
                                                                                    data&#13;
quantitative impact o f several o f the concerned interventions; and (ii) solid estimates o f&#13;
`social' benefits and costs over and above those o f `private' benefits and costs.&#13;

&#13;
5. ProgramActivities SupportedMitigateMarket Failure: The lack o f biosecurity in&#13;
the predominantly backyard poultry sector, the poor situation in both animal and human&#13;
health surveillance systems, and the possible inability o f the human curative system to&#13;
cope with a potential HPAIpandemic are all issues which are directly relatedto the effect&#13;
o f poverty and a lack o f prior capacity. Weaknesses inthe health systemidentified during&#13;
the Lao Health Services Improvement Project (HSIP; see WB Report 29314-LA) may be&#13;
exacerbated by the stress placed by a potential humaninfluenza pandemic. Many o f the&#13;
animal and public health issues can be averted or substantially mitigated with adequate&#13;
financing and improved performance o f the respective systems (in the animal case this&#13;
system does not exist at present).&#13;
&#13;
6. National Public Goods Nature: However, the benefits o f such new investments and&#13;
improvements would accrue inthe manner o f true public goods since one cannot exclude&#13;
persons unwilling to pay. As such, private provision o f such financing for building or&#13;
improving the concerned systems is not available in a society such as Lao PDR.&#13;
Primarily, the Government is involved in both animal and public health activities that&#13;
correct for market failure.       This Program provides support to public goods via&#13;
&#13;
 USDA (2005) op cit.&#13;
&#13;

                                             72&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
information systems for detection and response to outbreaks o f HPAI in poultry,&#13;
development o f systems for support to the poultry sector, surveillance and response for&#13;
the human health sector, building curative capacity for high virulence and infectious&#13;
diseases such as HPAI, and for information and awareness, which alone can bring large&#13;
rewards inpreventing such catastrophes.&#13;
&#13;
7. Global Public Goods Nature: Also, since infectious diseases emerging from the&#13;
sphere o f animal-human interaction - often with an origin in Asia - threaten to be&#13;
globally transmittable and highly disruptive, the investment in Lao PDR has beneficial&#13;
externalities beyond its borders. The in-country investment will reduce the overall, global&#13;
probability o f a particular virus achieving a form capable o f efficient human-to-human&#13;
transmission, and reduce the rate o f transmission to neighboring countries if such a virus&#13;
(that emerges elsewhere) reaches Lao PDR. As such, this investment has a global public&#13;
good nature that may be difficult to quantify but should not be disregarded. Inthe future,&#13;
further analysis afier this Program's inception, both in Lao PDR and elsewhere, will&#13;
generate the data that will make it easier to capture such positive externalities beyond the&#13;
narrow focus o fthe benefits o f avian and pandemic flu prevention and control.&#13;
&#13;
8. The investments o f the HSIP laid the groundwork for basic and key human health&#13;
infrastructure, training, and subsidies for use o f services. The investment in animal and&#13;
human health surveillance, human health curative services and preventive measures&#13;
against HPAI supported under this Program are those that will fill remaining gaps inthe&#13;
Lao PDR human development strategy and protect the momentum for progress against&#13;
future emerging and endemic infectious diseases.&#13;

&#13;
9. National,Multi-UseSystems Supportedby this Program: The overall development&#13;
objective o f the proposed World Bank support i s to contribute to Government's National&#13;
Plan, which aims to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry sector by AH1&#13;
infection and other zoonoses in Lao PDR, and to prepare for, control, and respond to&#13;
influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans. Inthis respect,&#13;
this project represents a significant investment in building up Lao PDR's animal and&#13;
human health capacity. The analysis below presents the benefits strictly for the focal&#13;
issue only, Le., the benefits to Lao PDR from preventing an outbreak o f HPAI.However,&#13;
the multi-sectoral surveillance and response capacity built with this investment will be&#13;
relevant for other diseases.&#13;
&#13;
10. This Program can be said to produce three concrete systemic results inthe animal and&#13;
human health sectors o f a society like Lao PDR (sector described inAppendix 1):policy&#13;
development, system design &amp; implementation, and human resource development. Since&#13;
these are basically investment activities, their benefits can be expected to extend beyond&#13;
the four-year life (2006-2010) o f the Lao Government's National Plan for Avian&#13;
Influenza control supported by the Program. Their main effect is potentially to reduce the&#13;
cost o f providing a given level and quality o f health services. An effect likely via the&#13;
policy component, for example, i s the potential reduction in the social cost o f providing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             73&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
animal and human health services. The animal health component includes support for&#13;
veterinary training and strengthened capacity for laboratory diagnosis. The human health&#13;
component o f the Program - even if focused on priority areas geared to respond to a&#13;
pandemic - will support ongoing Government efforts to improve curative services.&#13;
Specifically, the support given to ambulatory service (see Appendix 3) will help extend&#13;
the reach o fhuman health networks into areasmost at need.&#13;
&#13;
11. Since the administrative and distortionary costs o f financing such animal and health&#13;
services through taxes are likely to be quite highinLao PDR, use o f alternative forms o f&#13;
financing couldbe associated with significantly lower social costs. The net benefits o f the&#13;
project's investment indeveloping systemcapacity are also substantial.&#13;
&#13;
BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS&#13;
&#13;
12. Size of At-Risk Avian Population in Lao PDR: The series o f avian influenza&#13;
outbreaks during 2003 in Vietnam is estimated to have led to the death from disease or&#13;
culling o f 17.5 percent o f the 2003 poultry stock. The concentrations o f poultry stock in&#13;
three provinces (the same provinces that also saw many o f the outbreaks) leads us to&#13;
believe that in a sustained series o f outbreaks in the future (in the without Program&#13;
scenario), up to 30 percent o f the Lao PDR poultry stock could come at risk o f dying or&#13;
needingto be culled (since vaccination i s not a part ofthe present Lao strategy).&#13;
&#13;
13. Size of At-Risk Human Population in Lao PDR A human pandemic o f HPAI -&#13;
which could have origins in the region, or even within Lao PDR -                     could have a&#13;
devastating impact on the humanpopulation inthe without Program scenario because o f&#13;
the lack o f preparedness inthe health sector [see Appendix 1,paragraph 51. Many current&#13;
models o f worldwide impact use a baseline attack rate o f 30 percent and a case fatality&#13;
rate that could range from 0.5 to 2 percent. The historic case fatality rate for the 1918 flu&#13;
pandemic was in excess o f 2.5 percent for certain regions o f the U S where the best data&#13;
has been preserved, and attack rates as high as 60 percent were seen in certain towns".&#13;
The best estimates for the global attack rate for the 1918 epidemic are inthe range o f 20-&#13;
30 percent. Inrecent times, case fatality rate with avian flu (non-pandemic stage) among&#13;
humans has been 56.8 percent based on deaths observed in laboratory confirmed cases&#13;
[Source: WHO, as o f May 23`d, 20061. Assuming the virus will lose virulence in its&#13;
sustained human-to-human transmissible form, we assume a case fatality rate o f 2 percent&#13;
and an attack rate o f 20 percent among humans, which would anchor our assumptions&#13;
close to a moderate 1918-type pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
14. Other Assumptions made for this Analysis: There is no accessible/ reliable data&#13;
available to the team on the cost of hospitalization with a case o f acute respiratory&#13;
disease, which makes it difficult to account for the possible hospitalizations caused by a&#13;
HPAI outbreak. The benefits o f this avoided morbidity and health spending would be&#13;
large. The SARS epidemic in Asia during 2003 also led to an additional cost to&#13;
economies from excess avoidance behavior o f individuals (curtailing movement in&#13;

public, postponing purchases, etc), which could be as high as 1-2 percent of quarterly&#13;
output. While in a true pandemic such costs could build up to a highnumber, we do not&#13;
estimate them in this analysis. As such, our estimate of benefits in terms of `avoided&#13;

15. ProgramCosts by Component: Inresponse to the concerns raised about avian flu&#13;
and a potential human pandemic o f HPAI, the Lao PDR Government has prepared a&#13;
National Plan which will be supported by the Program. The Program will support the&#13;
following five strategic components:&#13;

16. In an initiative such as the Lao PDR National Plan, i.e., the Avian and Human&#13;
Influenza Control and Preparedness Program, the eventual results will accrue for the&#13;
prevention o f the focal disease if the entire project holds together, because o f the nature&#13;
o f the integrated risk (animal and human). Therefore, though we offer separate animal&#13;
and humanbenefit-cost ratios in the analysis below, it may be more appropriate to view&#13;
benefit-cost ratios for the Program as a whole. Similarly, though the directly Bank&#13;
supported portion (via AHIF, PHRD and IDA) i s valued at US$8 million (with other&#13;
donors providing US$5.56 million), the gains fkom the total Program spending per&#13;
component are o f interest.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
17. The extent o f protection achieved through the implementation o f the National Plan&#13;
will depend on the efficacy o f the prevention, containment and treatment measures.&#13;
Assumed levels o f efficacy o f these measures determine the range o f protection&#13;
scenarios, with the protection rates varying between 33 and 80 percent for bothbirds and&#13;
humans (see Scenarios 1-11).&#13;
&#13;
18. Benefits in the Agricultural (Animal) Sector: Then the donor-supported portion o f the&#13;
agricultural strategy (valued at US$5.35 million) that prevents death o fbirds from disease&#13;
or culling for 80 percent o f the at-risk flock returns a benefit-to-cost ratio o f 1.9. FA0&#13;
estimates that the total value o f a stream o f benefits from a single bird to households in&#13;
backyard poultry sectors is up to 7 times its market value (see References below, v). At&#13;
even half this rate o f return on investment, and given the same project efficiency, the&#13;
supported strategies return a benefit-to-cost ratio o f 6.6 (Scenario 111). Further, since 80&#13;
percent o f the flock i s held by small or backyard farmers, the strategy would prevent any&#13;
worsening o f existing inequity. The break-even protection rate (ie., the rate at which the&#13;
benefit-cost ratio is exactly one) is 44 percent. This i s the minimum Program efficiency&#13;
requiredwith these assumptions.&#13;
&#13;
19. Benefits in the Human Health Sector: Lao PDRhas so far not reported any laboratory&#13;
confirmed human cases. However, it would be at significant risk in a human pandemic&#13;
because o f a burdened health system with inadequate resources. Just avoiding the&#13;
notional loss o f income from the mortality after a country-wide attack rate o f 20 percent&#13;
and a fatality rate o f 2 percent would imply enormous returns. The present value o f this&#13;
annual income stream is calculated, going out 20 years, with a discount rate o f 10&#13;
percent, and then aggregated for all the deaths averted. In such a situation if the human&#13;
health portion o f the donor-supported strategy (valued at US$3.645 million) leads to a&#13;
protection rate o f 80 percent, there would at least be a benefit-to-cost ratio o f 24. Given&#13;
the high benefits from protected human lives, the break-even Program efficiency (i.e.,&#13;
protection rate) required is 4.5 percent.&#13;
&#13;
20. Overall:For overall benefit-cost analysis, the costs o f Components 4 and 5 are added&#13;
in as well. Then the Program overall returns a benefit-cost ratio of 7.2 with the base&#13;
assumptions (Scenario I),      which is sensitive to the backyard poultry value multiplier&#13;
(Scenario 111), as can be expected in a poultry sector where at least 80 percent o f the&#13;
holdings (and 90 percent o f producers) are backyardhousehold poultry farmers.&#13;
&#13;
21. Sensitivity Analysis: The benefits o f sensitivity analysis are low in an environment&#13;
where significant uncertainties are present from the epidemiological side. For example,&#13;
increasingthe discount rate from 10 percent to 12 percent would not significantly change&#13;
the cost-benefit ratio in the analysis o f the humanhealth component (Scenario V below).&#13;
However, since we have not accounted for appreciation in incomes over this 20-year&#13;
period (Lao PDR has seen per capita incomes rising steadily in recent years), then we&#13;
could bejustified inusing a lower discount rate to proxy for the use o f a fixed annual per&#13;
capita agricultural household income number. With discount rates at 5 percent, we see a&#13;
substantial rise inthe benefit-cost ratio (Scenario VI below).&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                               77&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The analysis above does not include any imputedvalue for the reduced pain and suffering&#13;
and loss o f life that would be directly attributable to the Program-provided health&#13;
services. Ifthis were included, it i s likely that the project would appear to reflect an even&#13;
more socially desirable use o fresources.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22. Distributional Consequences: Since 80 percent o f the flock i s held by small or&#13;
backyard farmers, the strategy would prevent any worsening o f existing inequity due to&#13;
an avian influenza outbreak sequence. The allocation o f benefits betweenhouseholds and&#13;
Lao society at large shows that agricultural households would benefit more from the&#13;
Program.&#13;
&#13;
PROGRAM'S FISCAL IMPACT AND SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
&#13;
23. The Program's civil works (laboratories) and equipment purchases could increase the&#13;
recurrent cost burden within the public health system by adding to maintenance costs.&#13;
The public health system strains to provide its existing infrastructure with adequate&#13;
operating resources (for example, salaries are low). The recent WHO-sponsored hospital&#13;
expenditures study notes that none o f the 16 hospitals in the study budgeted the&#13;
recommended level o f maintenance expenditure (ie., 4 percent o f initial construction cost&#13;
annually). The budgeted Program expenditure on civil works i s US$2.1 million, and the&#13;
expenditure on goods and non-consulting services, such as medical equipment, non-&#13;
medical equipment and furniture and vehicles is US$2.86 million [see Table A, Appendix&#13;
61. We cannot, however, apply the 4 percent criterion to the total o f these numbers as&#13;
most o f the investments see their operating costs supported under this Program. For&#13;
example, under Component 3 (Human Health: Curative Services), the purchase o f the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                78&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
five ambulances will be supported along with operating costs). Inthe same Component,&#13;
the possible requirement for mitigatory equipment in the public health system for&#13;
delivering services at the hospital level i s also supportedwith the inclusion o f operating&#13;
costs. Also, very little of the civil works expenditure under the Program i s new&#13;
construction (the National Animal Health laboratory i s a third complete and the rest of&#13;
the construction i s not beingimmediately financed; the virology laboratory for the public&#13;
health system i s being supported at the design and supervision phase o f construction at&#13;
present).&#13;
&#13;
24. As a result, the recurrent cost burden o f the Program i s likely to be manageable. In&#13;
any case, government revenue i s expected to grow as per projections in Lao PDR. For&#13;
example, ifthe GDP continues to grow at the currently projected rate o f 6-7 percent and&#13;
projected revenues from gold and copper mining and from the Nam Theun I1&#13;
Hydroelectric Power Project materialize as expected, total government expenditure in&#13;
2010 i s expected to be at least 85 percent higher than 2001-2002 levels. If the health&#13;
sector maintains even a constant share o f total government expenditure (estimated to be&#13;
5.5 percent in 2001 -2002), the level of government health spending (including capital&#13;
and recurrent expenditure) should increase from about US$20 million in 2001-2002 to&#13;
approximately US$37 million in2010.&#13;
&#13;
LEARNING FROMTHIS PROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
25. Where feasible, the Program has supported M&amp;E activities such that learning can be&#13;
gathered: (i) the Program itself via pilot projects which precede the rollout of the&#13;
              for&#13;
entire schedule o f interventions; and (ii)for other interventions in the region and&#13;
worldwide, via medium-term M&amp;E using international best practices. For example, M&amp;E&#13;
o f Component 3 will be financed through World Bank sources (at an estimated cost o f&#13;
US$40,000).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Current FAO/OIE procedures for control o f a HPAI outbreak call for immediate&#13;
'stamping out' operations as the most appropriate response, which necessitates&#13;
destruction o f all infected and 'at high risk' poultry in a defined radius around infected&#13;
areas.   To be effective, stamping out must be accompanied by control o f poultry&#13;
movement, proper disposal o f carcasses and infective material, and post-cull cleaning o f&#13;
affected farm structures. The compensation offered to the producer/farmers for culled&#13;
poultry is a crucial aspect o f the scheme for determining if the policy o f 'stamping out'&#13;
outbreaks achieves ex ante and ex post prevention o f the spread o f HPAI. Because of&#13;
these reasons, the compensation offered cannot be too high (reduces ex ante preventive&#13;
activities because risk is borne by the authorities and not the producer) or too low&#13;
(because this does not encourage prompt and honest disclosure o f the outbreak when it&#13;
occurs, i.e., ex post prevention). Another problem with too low compensation i s that this&#13;
leads to farmer resistance and hence epidemiologically ineffective culls. For instance, the&#13;
compensation was too low (about 25% o f the market price) result the reporting was very&#13;
limited. The compensation was later increased to about 50% o f the market price. In&#13;
Thailand, the compensation i s about 75% o f the market price.&#13;
&#13;
Certain key principles in compensation scheme administration and management will&#13;
affect its utility. This Appendix discusses the issues indesign and administration that will&#13;
be considered bythe Lao PDRcompensation Program.&#13;
&#13;
DESIGNOFA COMPENSATION SCHEME&#13;
&#13;
The main decision in designing a compensation scheme will be how much to pay for the&#13;
culled birds to the affected producer. In essence, this is a cash transfer between two&#13;
sectors o f the economy (government and poultry producers, both backyard and&#13;
commercial), but depending on the size o f the payment relative to the size o f the loss, it&#13;
can change behavior. If the payment i s too much, it can lead to behavior that leads to&#13;
greater risk o f disease spread. Iftoo little, it can again lead to behaviors increasing risk&#13;
o f disease spread, besides being socially inequitable. The discussion below explores the&#13;
processes governing such behavior. The best compensation scheme i s one which will&#13;
never have to be used; Le., after the scheme i s widely publicized, it fosters incentives for&#13;
producers to take actions enhancing biosecurity o f their farms, leading to ex ante&#13;
prevention. A compensationpayout can be designed with three components:&#13;
&#13;
        Restocking Component: This portion of the payout helps the farmers restock their&#13;
        flock after the outbreak. The anchor for the payout per head o f culled poultry&#13;
        payout i s the appropriate market price (for different ages and types o f poultry).&#13;
        The market price may be that prevailing currently/previously in the local market&#13;
        or that expected to prevail after the outbreak. The payout is a percentage o f the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              80&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        appropriate market price. This percentage affects the incentives o f producers to&#13;
        take preventive behavior.&#13;
    0   Livelihood Suppovt Component: Since there i s usually a gap between the date the&#13;
        poultry i s culled to when the farmers receives their payout and are able to restock&#13;
        and market hisbirds, there is some loss o f income. Incertain cases when the local&#13;
        market collapses after the outbreak the farmer may not be able to sell products&#13;
        from his restocked flock such that the duration o f loss considered and the amount&#13;
        o f support neededmay be higher.&#13;
    0   Costs of Culling: In cases where the producers may face costs in culling and&#13;
        disposing o f their birds (i.e. the culling is not completely conducted by culling&#13;
        teams), such costs may be covered.&#13;
&#13;
Recent International Experience: In Vietnam during its series o f avian influenza&#13;
outbreaks, a compensation support strategy was adopted such that the need to support the&#13;
poultry sector (by providing livelihood support at 50% o f the market value of the culled&#13;
birdplus a flat 2000 VND restocking component) was balanced with the long-term view&#13;
o f curtailing a severe threat to public health (by providing the right incentives). Table 1&#13;
below shows the 2004 strategy vs. a benchmark strategy developed with the help o f FA0&#13;
and national consultants. The current strategy allows for risk-sharing between the farmer&#13;
and the government, but with more o f the burden on the farmer (ifwe accept that the lost&#13;
income per bird was actually 40,000 VND). The proposed strategy, available to all&#13;
affected farmers, would share more o f the risk, support restocking, while leaving&#13;
incentives to "declare the disease and to cull the poultry to avoid illegal selling to the&#13;
market andprevent a public health threat" [Riviere-Cinnamond et al2005]. The policy i s&#13;
therefore aimed at both ex ante and expost prevention. The discussion below will clarify&#13;
such principles so that the design can be replicated as per local context inLao PDR.&#13;
&#13;
AchievingEx Ante Prevention:Several actions can be taken by backyard producers to&#13;
keep their flocks safe from infection: curtailing the range o f movement o f free-ranging&#13;
birds, installing barriers between cooped poultry and wild birds, and proper hygiene and&#13;
control o f the farm area. In the absence o f any other incentive, producers shirk from&#13;
taking these actions because they involve a tangible investment o f time, effort, and&#13;
money, whereas the costs just to themselves in the fbture from a potential infectious&#13;
disease outbreak seem less tangible. Curtailing the movement o f scavenging free-range&#13;
ducks may also lead to more pest activity in rice fields (plus the feed that must be&#13;
provided for birds kept indoors). Therefore, for the average backyard farmer, some&#13;
biosecurity measures may be costly. Another factor that reduces incentives for ex ante&#13;
prevention is the lack o f specificity in `stamping out' operations.&#13;
&#13;
Setting a price lower than the current market price introduces some risk-sharing between&#13;
government and the producer. The producer has an incentive in lowering the risk by&#13;
choosing a positive level o f preventive actions. Ifcompensation i s sufficiently lower than&#13;
market price, then given that the cost o f an outbreak will be suffered by all producers,&#13;
there is a strong incentive on the community to protect itself. The establishment o f&#13;
poultry producer groups at the village level in high risk provinces could be helpful. The&#13;
easy availability o f information on biosecwity measures to be taken is critical, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
government may even subsidize the cost o f measures such as netting, cleaning&#13;
equipment, farm boots, etc, so that the decision i s easier for the farmer.&#13;
&#13;
Achieving Ex Post Prevention: In the interests o f disease control and to prevent the&#13;
worse event that humans may get infected, it i s necessary that fiamedproducers come&#13;
forth and declare disease outbreaks as son as they occur. Producer may face an incentive&#13;
to hide the outbreak. First, there i s the fear o f social sanction especially when the culling&#13;
will affect the local community o f producers and everyone suffers the lower price level.&#13;
Second, there i s the issue that there will be a loss to the producer from the timing and&#13;
amount o f compensation. This latter fact may be particularly dangerous as it could&#13;
prompt producers to rush infected flocks to market, increasing chance o f spread,&#13;
especially inthe wet market conditions that obtain inS-E Asia.&#13;
&#13;
How can policymakers keep the compensation price low enough to sustain incentives for&#13;
ex ante prevention, and yet provide incentives for truthful and prompt disclosure o f&#13;
outbreaks? Several options can be considered:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0   Rewardsfor reporting: The authorities can offer incentive for promptness in&#13;
            reporting an outbreak. The value could be set at a level which still leaves&#13;
            some net loss after comparing the value o f the culled flock plus the reward, to&#13;
            the value o f the flock when no outbreak i s declared in the area. A reward&#13;
            scheme was set up in Afghanistan, where there was also a payment to the&#13;
            veterinarian and animal health worker who reported the suspected case and&#13;
            confirmed it to be positive [McLeod 20051. Reward schemes could lead to&#13;
            bogus reporting, where the delay between reporting and Confirmation i s large&#13;
            or confirmation via local veterinarians or staff i s non-existent/compromised.&#13;
            Quick field assay kits and guides for veterinary extension workers could also&#13;
            help in cutting out bogus reporting if a visit by them is made the mandatory&#13;
            first step to filing a claim for the reward.&#13;
        0   Penalties for non-reporting: Fines or criminal penalties could be levied on&#13;
            those found not to have reported an outbreak that is discovered by other&#13;
            means. Though this would strengthen the incentive to report, it would be&#13;
            dependent on the authorities' ability to detect where the outbreak originated.&#13;
            Inclose village communities, this may be difficult. A combination o f reward&#13;
            (for reporting) and penalty (for not reporting), if administratively feasible,&#13;
            could work well.&#13;
        0   Increase the payment: A payment above the market price, and possibly&#13;
            including a substantial component o f livelihood support would encourage&#13;
            prompt reporting. In fact it would normally encourage over-reporting,&#13;
            including even the cases o f farmers infecting their animals to claim&#13;
            compensation. It i s conceivable that a payment and penalty scheme could be&#13;
            adopted, where payments above market price would be made to the reporting&#13;
            producer and to everyone else in the culling zone, but penalties would be&#13;
            enforced on all who were found to have not invested inpreventive biosecurity&#13;
            previously.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                82&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
At the moment, the various country models suggest that both ex ante and ex post&#13;
prevention needs would be served best by a compensation scheme set at below market&#13;
pricefor all affectedproducers, with arewardincentive for the producer promptreporting&#13;
a real outbreak in their flock (to be confirmed by rapid dispatch o f trained animal health&#13;
workers to confirm that a claim for the reward and further confirmatory tests i s&#13;
warranted) .&#13;
&#13;
KEY PRINCIPLES&#13;
&#13;
While the value o f the restocking and the livelihood support components can be set&#13;
through analysis based on the country and sector context, there are some general&#13;
principles that can help insetting up such schemes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Set different prices for different types of birds (within and across species): This&#13;
        will ensure that high-value birds such as fighting cocks do not get compensated at&#13;
        the same rate as backyard native fowl. If this were to happen, there would be&#13;
        another disincentive to report. Also, there are obvious market price differentials&#13;
        between broilers and breeder chickens, native and commercial chickens, ducks&#13;
        and other poultry, etc.&#13;
        Picking the reference market price: Further research i s required into the market&#13;
        price(s) to be chosen for each typehpecies o f bird, especially in situations where&#13;
        no official prices are recorded or where recorded prices are not representative for&#13;
        all situations and regions. If the price chosen i s the current market price, then it&#13;
        will not take into account the real possibility that price after the outbreak may be&#13;
        much lower. Therefore, this would pervert incentives. The alternative is to adopt&#13;
        the Vietnamese policy and have a restocking component that i s a fraction o f the&#13;
        current price.&#13;
    0   Uniformity in rates across the country: Once the reference market price list&#13;
        (above) is picked (varying for the type and species o f bird) they must be uniform&#13;
        across the country. Without uniform rates -- farmers with infected flocks will&#13;
        have an incentive to move birds around the country seeking the best&#13;
        compensation. This can be very dangerous epidemiologically, as it could spread&#13;
        infection along crowded routes and by increasing viral shedding inbirds stressed&#13;
        by travel. In border areas, there would be incentives to smuggle across&#13;
        international lines if price differentials are substantial. Therefore, proper border&#13;
        policing and the cooperation o f various concerned agencies o f the government&#13;
        would be needed as well.&#13;
    0   Secure consistency and accountability in compensation: Needless to say,&#13;
        incentives will become grounded and expectations stable if it i s believed that&#13;
        payments will occur as promised in the policy in a transparent and equitable&#13;
        manner.&#13;
        Verification procedures: As noted above for the 'reward' portion o f the&#13;
        compensation scheme (for prompt reporting), speed i s o f important in outbreak&#13;
        control. While culling could occur quickly after the report o f the outbreak,&#13;
        payments may take place after a lag period. It i s necessary that the process for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              83&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        registration and subsequent verification o f status be speedy such that payments&#13;
        can occur inthe timeframe and livelihood losses be minimized.&#13;
&#13;
Management ofthe fund: The program includes a study to look into the design and&#13;
levels o f compensation in Laos PDR to help set-up a Compensation FundManual. The&#13;
Manual should include a discussion o f where the fund will be located and who will&#13;
manage it. A portion of the fund may be set aside for immediate foreseeable needs and&#13;
the rest to be disbursed only inthe event o f an actual need.&#13;
&#13;
Internal Controls: Inrelation to the compensation fund sub-component, the following&#13;
minimum internal control procedures and risk mitigation measures are warranted&#13;
before any flow o f funds is initiated:&#13;
    0   The responsible government unit (to be determined) will outline inthe financial&#13;
        and operational manual mechanisms for identifying those eligible for&#13;
        compensation grants, ensuring that there will be no multiple claims.      This&#13;
        government unit will also maintain and update a verifiable claims database that&#13;
        will facilitate payment o f grants.&#13;
    0   Culling. In the event o f a verified outbreak o f HPAI among poultry, the&#13;
        necessary culling and carcass disposal will be done under the supervision o f the&#13;
        DLF or DLF-contracted private veterinarians by properly equipped and&#13;
        protected staff (DLF staff, veterinary cadres, and/or laborers hired by DLF for&#13;
        the purpose).      The culling could be done in the presence and "social&#13;
        supervision" o f a small local committee that includes at least two trusted&#13;
        members o f the village community. The community representatives may be&#13;
        from village poultry producer group, or other locally recognized and trusted&#13;
        community organizations.       This committee will verify the number o f birds&#13;
        culled and their owners, so as to ensure a correct count and full transparency&#13;
        for subsequent compensation payments. The commission members will sign,&#13;
        andthe poultry owners will countersignthe list o fbirds culled.&#13;
        The community/village authorities will authorize the claims and forward them&#13;
        to the responsible authority.        The responsible government unit, after&#13;
        verification o f the claims - including check against claims database and other&#13;
        independent information, will issue payment instruction.&#13;
    0   Compensation payment to livestock owners will be in cash. There will be no&#13;
        vouchers or animal replacements. The flow o f funds arrangements still need to&#13;
        be agreed upon with the recipient for making compensation payments, but such&#13;
        arrangements would need to be ready before disbursement for this cash&#13;
        grant/compensation fund component.&#13;
        Flow of Funds Linkages: The prompt payment o f compensation may involve&#13;
        several different ministries and levels o f government. Therefore, where these&#13;
        mechanisms have not been used frequently, they may need to be tested such&#13;
        that all levels understand the relevant informational triggers and payments are&#13;
        not delayed. Reputation loss from payment delays in the initial culling&#13;
        activities can behardto overcome.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              84&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   0   The responsible government unit will hire additional staff to perform periodic&#13;
       visits  to  the   community/village    level to    review    claims   for  cash&#13;
       grants/compensation fund submitted andpaid.&#13;
   0   There will be annual operational reviews o f the cash grants/compensation find&#13;
       by independent reviewers in accordance to TOR acceptable to the Bank, and&#13;
       any significant weaknesses identifiedwill require prompt resolution.&#13;
   0   In addition, the external independent auditors would be asked to give an&#13;
       opinion on the reasonableness o f the accounting, reporting and internal controls&#13;
       inrespect of cash grants/compensation find, andthe audit TOR (acceptable to&#13;
       the Bank) would incorporatethese specific requirements&#13;
&#13;
The compensation scheme to be finalized for Lao PDR will require the involvement o f&#13;
several stakeholders (government, poultry producer groups, donors and technical&#13;
agencies) such that the best outcome suitable for the needs o f the people o f Lao can be&#13;
chosen.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Avian and Human Influenza Control
            and Preparedness (GPAI) Project for Lao PDR aims to
            contribute to Government's National Plan which aims to
            minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry sectors
            by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infection and
            other zoonoses in Lao PDR, and to prepare for, control, and
            respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease
            emergencies in humans. There are five project components: 1)
            The animal health component will reduce the risk of
            introduction of the Avian Flu in the formal and informal
            sectors, as well as enhance the capacity for early detection
            and warning and rapid and effective response in case of an
            outbreak. 2) The human health surveillance and response
            component aims to improve the surveillance in humans, as
            well as putting in place an integrated (human and animal)
            surveillance system. 3) The human health curative services
            will strengthen the curative and laboratory resources.
            Information, education and communication will formulate a
            national awareness campaign on avian and human influenza and
            disseminate the same. 4) The fourth component, program
            coordination and regulatory framework, will strengthen the
            function of the National Coordination Committee for the
            Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases, and develop
            necessary financial, legal, and monitoring and evaluation frameworks.
