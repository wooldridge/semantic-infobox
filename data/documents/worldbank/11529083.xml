Key concepts and terms used&#13;
Annuitization is the process of converting an investment&#13;
into a series of periodic payments.&#13;
Assets include all forms of constructed facility and&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
Capital expenditure (CAPEX) is the money required at&#13;
the beginning of a project to finance or purchase materials,&#13;
land, labor and any other costs related to construction and&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
Cost benefit analysis takes into account both financial&#13;
and socio-economic costs and benefits to assess the&#13;
comparative advantage of different options in monetary&#13;
terms.&#13;
Design life is the estimated lifespan of an asset.&#13;
Discounting is a method used to convert future costs or&#13;
benefits to present values using a discount rate.&#13;
Discount rate is the annual percentage rate at which&#13;
the present value of a future dollar (or other currency) is&#13;
estimated to lose its value over time.&#13;
Net Present Value (NPV) is an aggregated value used in&#13;
whole life cycle analysis to measure the resultant financial&#13;
and economic benefit of a good or service when all costs&#13;
and benefits are taken into consideration. A positive NPV&#13;
indicates a net benefit and a negative NPV a net loss.&#13;
Operational expenditure (OPEX) is the money that is&#13;
required to sustain a facility or activity (including labor, fuel,&#13;
and all other operation and maintenance costs).&#13;
Planning horizon is the duration over which the whole-&#13;
life cycle costs are evaluated.&#13;
Whole life-cycle analysis involves a long-term&#13;
perspective taking into account all the costs incurred and&#13;
the benefits received over the total duration of a project up&#13;
until the planning horizon is reached.&#13;

1.   To enable a fair comparison of options, costs            7.   The estimated cost of management support&#13;
     for sanitation and hygiene promotion were                     is US$ 140 per household per year during the&#13;
     assumed.                                                      course of the project. These costs have been&#13;
2.   Costs for awareness raising and sanitation                    allocated to CAPEX (75 percent and OPEX&#13;
     promotion costs by ONEA are reported to be                    25 percent). In addition, there is US$ 101 for&#13;
     US$ 145. We have assumed that 75 percent is                   household ecosan promotion and capacity&#13;
     for sanitation promotion and 25 percent is for                building (US$ 89 per household for household&#13;
     promotion of grey-water leach pits.                           training; and US$ 12 per household for training&#13;
                                                                   of the farmers). Therefore, the total values is&#13;

     the household pays back the capital investment&#13;
                                                                   and US$35 for OPEX.&#13;

            Study for financial and economic analysis
            of ecological sanitation in Sub-Saharan Africa
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This study on financial and economic
            analysis of ecological sanitation (ecosan) in Sub-Saharan
            Africa was financed by the Water and Sanitation Program
            (WSP). It focused on a comparison of sanitation technologies
            suitable for urban settlements. The aim of the study was to
            compare ecosan with conventional sanitation systems in terms
            of financial and economic costs and benefits, in order to
            assist decision-makers and sponsors of development programs
            to make informed decisions about relative merits of
            different types of sanitation. To achieve this, an
            analytical framework and a computer model were developed to
            assess and compare different technologies in terms of
            financial and economic Net Present Value (NPV). The economic
            benefits derived from improved sanitation include health and
            environmental benefits, as well as those which are
            associated to excreta reuse. The latter is modeled by taking
            into account the volume of excreta, the mass of nutrients
            produced, and the monetary value of increased crop yields.
            Although there are a wide range of ecosan technologies, the
            study focused on those which have been implemented at
            sufficient scales, to enable a more robust analysis based,
            on a more extensive data set possible.
