TUNISIA&#13;
NATIONAL RURAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:        Banque Nationale Agricole (BNA)&#13;
Guarantor:       Republic of Tunisia&#13;
Amount:          US$65 million equivalent&#13;
Terms:           17 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, plus&#13;
commitment fee of 0.75% less any waiver. Onlending by BNA would be at market conditions.&#13;
Project&#13;
Description:     Consistent with the Government's priorities, the primary objectives of the project are to assist&#13;
Tunisia and BNA in promoting viable private investment in rural areas and in strengthening,&#13;
on a sustainable basis, the financial viability and institutional reform process of BNA in order&#13;
to improve its development impact on the country's rural sector. Bank involvement would help&#13;
develop a sound rural finance system well-integrated into an increasingly liberalized financial&#13;
sector. The project would fulfill fundamental economic and social needs in Tunisia for&#13;
progress in rural development, greater efficiency in rural financial intermediation, and private&#13;
sector growth. In this context, the project will be integral to the Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(GAS) articulated in April 1993. The Government has already made operational a drought risk&#13;
management scheme that is expected to reduce risk for farmers and for BNA and other banks&#13;
in the future. The project also include a study on group lending and elements of targeted&#13;
interventions to, and in support of the rural poor in particular through the promotion of&#13;
financially viable credit and savings schemes. Agriculture is a key sector in Tunisia, and&#13;
provision of credit has been one of the main factors in developing the agricultural and rural&#13;
sectors.&#13;
Implementation,&#13;
Beneficiaries:    Specifically the project would fund over a four-year implementation period: (a) medium- and&#13;
long-term credit to private farmers and investors to finance a wide range of investments&#13;
including irrigation development with water conservation measures, livestock and forage&#13;
development, tree crop plantations, forestry development, farm equipment, storage facilities,&#13;
greenhouses, agro-processing plants, coastal fisheries, rural housing, and rural non-farm&#13;
investments, and (b) project-related training, consulting services for the strengthening of BNA&#13;
management, planning, computerization, rural outreach, and internal controls. A mid-term&#13;
review will assess progress made during implementation.&#13;
Risk:            Since the Government of Tunisia reemphasized the role of BNA in the development of the&#13;
country's rural sector and the need to make BNA a financially viable and strongly autonomous&#13;
institution, and ensuring that the viability of the first deposit bank of the country is&#13;
sustainable, BNA has the highest political support for its reforms. Thus, the risk outside the&#13;
control of BNA of slower progress in BNA's financial reengineering is considered reduced.&#13;
Tunisia, however, is vulnerable to droughts, and these have an immediate adverse impact on&#13;
farm credit recoveries and rural savings mobilization. In addition, poor repayment discipline&#13;
in the past in Tunisia has had a negative impact on BNA and other banks. The quality of BNA&#13;
new management, improved credit policies and client selection, and the adoption of enhanced&#13;
prudential banking regulations for loan classification, loan loss provisions and capital adequacy&#13;
in Tunisia, as part of the ongoing financial sector reforms are important positive developments&#13;
which are minimizing risks. On the basis of past experience and current progress, IBRD funds&#13;
are not expected to be at more than normal risk, in a country like Tunisia, if the Government&#13;
is committed to further improving its ability to manage droughts. The Government would&#13;
assume the foreign exchange risk against a fee charged to BNA, as for any other bank in&#13;
Tunisia.&#13;

NATIONAL RURAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.01         Within the context of the Eighth Economic Development Plan of Tunisia (1992-1996), the&#13;
Government of Tunisia (GOT) and the National Agricultural Bank (BNA) have requested Bank assistance to&#13;
finance, with other cofinanciers, a line of credit for the rural sector. The Eighth Plan envisages an increased&#13;
role for private sector investment within a more liberalized and outward-oriented economy.' Consistent with&#13;
the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS of 1993), the National Rural Finance Project will promote private sector&#13;
investment and sustainable financial intermediation in rural areas. It has two interdependent objectives, a&#13;
development and an institutional objective. The development objective is to promote and finance viable private&#13;
investment in rural areas and to help alleviate rural poverty. The institutional objective is to strengthen, on a&#13;
sustainable basis, the financial viability and institutional reform process of a major multiservice bank--the BNA--&#13;
which is the key bank for agriculture in Tunisia. These objectives have the highest priority in Tunisia.&#13;
1.02         The Project would be essentially implemented by BNA, which is a client in good standing with&#13;
the Bank. The project would finance on-farm investments undertaken by private farmers; and investments for&#13;
the establishment or expansion of agro-industries (including working capital and technical assistance), of private&#13;
coastal fisheries, of artisans (men and women), and of rural non-farm enterprises; for reforestation and&#13;
environmental protection; and for rural housing investments. The Project would also finance training/technical&#13;
assistance to strengthen BNA's organizational and regional structure, and improve the planning and control&#13;
process, including BNA's decentralized Management Information System (MIS), and support, on a pilot basis,&#13;
Tunisia's climatic risk insurance mechanism, and support the preparation of a study on informal rural finance&#13;
and group lending. The Project would be implemented over a four-year period (1995-1999).&#13;
1.03         The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$420 million, of which US$223 million (53%)&#13;
is foreign exchange. A Bank loan to BNA would finance part of BNA's medium- and long-term lending, and&#13;
part of its institutional development cost during the Project period. BNA's own resources, sub-borrowers'&#13;
contributions, and loans from the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaujbau (KfW) of Germany and the Caisse Franfaise&#13;
de D&amp;veloppement (CFD) would provide most of the remaining investment resources.&#13;
II. THE AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL SECTORS&#13;
A. Economic Outlook&#13;
2.01         Background on the Tunisian economy, past economic performance, recent economic&#13;
trends and the Government's adjustment effort as well as current economic, financial and social priorities are&#13;

of the President of April 16, 1993 on a Second Forestry Development Project of the Republic of Tunisia (Report&#13;
No. P-6006-TUN).&#13;
2.02       . The Bank and the IMF have supported the economic adjustment process in Tunisia to foster&#13;
sustainable and equitable growth. Tunisia has made significant progress in macro-economic stabilization during&#13;
the last ten years. The present project would help the Government in its effort to promote the private sector,&#13;
to develop the agricultural sector in poor rural areas and thereby create employment, to facilitate export&#13;
promotion and domestic resource mobilization while reducing pressure for public expenditure.&#13;

B. Place of Agriculture in the Economy&#13;
2.03          Agriculture plays an essential role in Tunisia's economy. It generates 16% of GDP, employs&#13;
almost one out of every three workers in the labor force, and contributes about 11 % to total export earnings&#13;
(Annex 8).&#13;
2.04          Out of a total land area of 16.4 million hectares (ha) in Tunisia, only 8.4 million are suitable&#13;
for agriculture and grazing. Cultivable land amounts to 5.3 million ha, of which 25% are devoted to cereals,&#13;
35% to crop trees, 10% to forage crops, fruits and vegetables, grain legumes and industrial crops, and 20%&#13;
left fallow. Animal husbandry is a major activity, with the majority of the national herd's 624 thousand heads&#13;
of cattle and 6.5 million small ruminants raised on small farms.&#13;
2.05          While Tunisian agriculture is predominantly rainfed, a majority of Tunisian farmers work small&#13;
holdings with low income. According to the 1989 agricultural survey (see Annex 1), out of the estimated total&#13;
of 387,100 holdings engaged in some form of agricultural production, 330,000 are small. Thus, 85 % of farmers&#13;
own farms of sizes no larger than 20 ha, which constitute 39% of a total agricultural land surface area of 5.3&#13;
million ha. The average farm size is 15 ha, broken up into four parcels, each averaging 3.7 ha. Only 36%&#13;
of irrigated acreage belongs to small farmers. On these meager land resources, sources of household income&#13;
are diversified between crop and livestock and between farm and off-farm. The results of a consumption survey&#13;
and data on rural household income are in Annex 8 para. 2. Based on the 1984 population census, updated in&#13;
1989, 120,000 heads of households consider farm activity their principal activity.&#13;
C. Agriculture Sector Performance and Government Strategy&#13;
2.06          Past Performance. Between 1980 and 1988, the agricultural GDP has been highly variable,&#13;
exhibiting a coefficient of variation (c.v.) of 0.13, with estimates of c.v. for durum wheat at 0.44, for bread&#13;
wheat at 0.55 and for barley at 0.58.2 Vulnerability to severe droughts is a chronic problem. In the eighties,&#13;
agriculture suffered from severe droughts in 1982-83, 1985-86, 1987-88, and again in 1988-89.&#13;
2.07          Government strategy in the Eighth Plan. The central objective remains food security. The&#13;
main policy shift initiated under the previous plan period, 1987 - 1991, continues to be increased emphasis on&#13;
efficiency rather than on self-sufficiency at all costs; on export promotion and outward orientation rather than&#13;
import substitution; on reliance on private sector rather than public sector; and on decentralized market&#13;
mechanisms rather than on centralized public controls. Specifically, the GOT has implemented a program of&#13;
structural adjustments to achieve the following: (i) improve the pricing and marketing framework; (ii) reform&#13;
parastatals and privatize them; (iii) redemarcate activities for valid public sector intervention; (iv) reorient&#13;
public expenditures to strengthening these activities; and (v) improve the monitoring and evaluation capabilities&#13;
of the Ministry of Agriculture. Current challenges on the Agricultural Sector are in Annex 8 para. 4.&#13;
D. Bank Role in the Agriculture Sector&#13;
2.08          Bank group lending to Tunisia began in 1967. To date, 105 loans and credits have been made,&#13;
supported by US$4.6 billion Bank and IDA funds, net of cancellations. In agriculture, 17 projects have been&#13;
completed and six are being implemented, totalling US$720.9 million of Bank group lending. (See details by&#13;
project in Annex 8 para. 6). Performance of Bank-financed projects in agriculture has generally been satisfactory.&#13;
The implementation of the Bank's portfolio in Tunisia is currently satisfactory.&#13;

2.09          Lessons Learned from Past Agricultural Credit Projects. Performance of the Agricultural&#13;
Credit Projects has been good compared to agreed objectives at the time, and trend improving. In contrast to&#13;
the First Credit Project, the Second Credit Project provided investment credit to small/medium farmers who,&#13;
up to 1976, had limited access to institutional credit. The Project Completion Reports (PCRs) of the First Three&#13;
Credit Projects note that disbursements were affected by competition with Government credit schemes offering&#13;
loans at lower subsidized interest rates and by a lack of profitability of agricultural operations. The OED&#13;
Performance Audit Report of June 1993 on the Fourth Credit Project underscores the need to continue&#13;
institutional and financial improvements at the National Agricultural Bank (BNA) through adjustment towards&#13;
market orientation, phasing out of Government-subsidized credit schemes, recovery discipline, BNA&#13;
reorganization on a decentralized basis to allow it to reach a larger number of farmers, and its gradual&#13;
assumption of full responsibility for all credit decisions without Government interference.&#13;
III. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR&#13;
A. The Banking System&#13;
3.01          Institutional Setting. Tunisia's banking system, which is well developed, consists of the&#13;
Banque Centrale de Tunisie or Central Bank (BCT), twelve deposit (commercial) banks, eight investment&#13;
(development) banks, one specialized savings institution, and eight off-shore banks. The Government holds a&#13;
majority share in four of the five larger commercial banks; two private commercial banks are subsidiaries of&#13;
foreign banks, and several other private commercial banks have significant portions of their capital held by&#13;
foreign interests. GOT holds a 50% share in many of the development banks, and foreign governments&#13;
(Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates) hold the other 50%.&#13;
3.02          As of 1992, the commercial banks represented about 82% of total assets of the banking system.&#13;
At that time, there were two financial leasing companies, with total assets totalling TD 64 million, or less than&#13;
I % of the total assets of the banking system. Other financial institutions included a number of insurance&#13;
companies, a postal checking center, several mutual funds, and investment firms. The capital market is just&#13;
starting and the stock market is small, with only twelve companies listed permanently, of which nine are banks.&#13;
Furthermore, new financial institutions, such as factoring companies and investment firms, as well as financial&#13;
instruments are continually being created in response to emerging opportunities.&#13;
B. Financial Sector Reforms&#13;
3.03             The highly regulated financial sector has been gradually undergoing substantial reforms&#13;
since 1986. The reforms seek to: (i) increase market-orientation; (ii) deepen financial intermediation;&#13;
(iii) liberalize interest rates; (iv) reduce Government directed credit; and (v) strengthen the regulatory and&#13;
supervisory framework.&#13;
3.04          Increasing market orientation.   The shift has been from  centralized control through&#13;
quantitative credit guidelines to decentralized management through freeing selected interest rates and through&#13;
modifying the global ratio which imposed portfolio requirements on banks.3 Most deposit rates were freed&#13;
except those on convertible Dinar accounts of Tunisians working abroad and on site deposits. Most lending&#13;
rates of commercial banks were also freed except those for priority activities, (agricultural production, exports,&#13;
small- and medium-scale enterprises in industry and commerce, and energy saving industries). The portfolio&#13;
requirement that commercial banks lend at least 18% of their deposits to priority activities was reduced to at&#13;
3      Republic of Tunisia: Country Economic Memorandum--The Road to an Outward-Oriented Economy, Annex 2 on&#13;
the Tunisian Financial System in Support of Investment, March 1990, pp. 6-13. The CEM is being updated (Towards&#13;
the 21st Century, YC Report No. 14375-TUN of April 1995). The global ratio refers to required allocation of bank&#13;
deposits. Banks were required to allocate up to 43% of their deposits to the following: 10 year Treasury Bonds (20%);&#13;
housing saving funds bonds (5%); medium- and long-term lending (18%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
least 10% at regulated rates in 1989. Prior authorization requirement from the Central Bank for private&#13;
investment was abolished except for those investments benefitting from special advantages.&#13;
3.05          Deepening financial intermediation. GOT broadened the participation in the money market&#13;
in three ways: (i) banks were allowed to issue a wider range of certificates of deposits (CDs); (ii) non-bank&#13;
enterprises were allowed to lend directly by purchasing CDs; and (iii) non-bank enterprises with a minimum&#13;
capital of TD I million were allowed to borrow by issuing a new commercial paper, billets de trisorerie. To&#13;
inject or withdraw liquidity, the Central Bank has been undertaking weekly auctions in the money market to&#13;
buy or sell its securities. Within the Economic and Financial Reforms Support Loan (EFRSL, FY92), the GOT&#13;
is committed (1992-1996) to reforming the Treasury's borrowing practices which tend to crowd out private&#13;
sector investment and to removing fiscal distortions which inhibit resale of bonds and shares. The GOT would&#13;
be redeeming its bons d'Fquipement which represent a tax on financial intermediation and banks would be&#13;
allowed to hold 20% of their portfolio in any Treasury security. The unification of the six sectoral investment&#13;
codes and the reform of the system of rediscounted preferential credits should increase the supply of shares and&#13;
their appeal to the public as financial investments.&#13;
3.06          Interest Rate Liberalization. Until 1987, the BCT closely regulated a detailed structure of&#13;
interest rates for deposits: by term, by corporate vs. individual deposits, and by size. It regulated a similarly&#13;
detailed structure of interest rates for lending: by sector, by purpose, by size of loan, and by whether the loan&#13;
was rediscountable. Because real rates were largely negative, credit was rationed administratively. BCT&#13;
required prior authorization on loans and refinancing, involving cumbersome procedures and long delays.&#13;
Among other requirements on the use of their funds, commercial banks were required to allocate at least 18%&#13;
of their deposits to medium and long-term lending, of which 2% to small and medium scale enterprises.&#13;
3.07          In 1988, rates on deposit were completely deregulated, and, notwithstanding attempts by&#13;
commercial banks to agree on ceilings on deposit rates, competition for deposits is strong. Prior authorization&#13;
on loans and rediscounts was abolished in 1988, thereby introducing greater accountability and the need for&#13;
stronger appraisal capacity in the banks. Furthermore, lending rates for deposit banks were liberalized, subject&#13;
to a ceiling of 3% over the money market rate. Under the Economic and Financial Reforms Support Loan&#13;
(EFRSL, approved in FY92), as a transitional measure, lending rates were further liberalized to allow for each&#13;
bank's lending rates being an average spread of 3 % over the money market rate. With the removal of this last&#13;
administrative constraint in June 1994, lending rates for deposit banks were fully liberalized, following which&#13;
the third tranche of the EFRSL was released in September 1994. For the financing of priority activities, which&#13;
represented about 7% of the banking sector commitments in 1994 and 8% of BNA's loans, (2.6% is for&#13;
agriculture, i.e., TD53 million out of which 90% are short-term credits), rates are still regulated4 for all banks&#13;
as follows: (i) 10% on short-term and some medium-term lending for agricultural production; (ii) 11 % for&#13;
investments and production short-term and credit to small- and medium-sized enterprises; (iii) 10% for&#13;
investments in energy saving industries; and (iv) 11 % in export-oriented industries and 10.25% on short-term&#13;
export prefinancing.5 The initial objective on these regulated rates was to reach money market rates. In fact,&#13;
they are now exceeding them (8.8%). Interest rates are strongly positive, with most lending rates at 12.5 -&#13;
14%, and inflation rates for 1992 and 1993 of 5.7% and 5.4% respectively (and about 5.1% in 1994). In&#13;
response to these measures, commercial banks in particular have developed departments specialized in analyzing&#13;
credit risks and are beginning to differentiate their risks through the interest rates charged on loans.&#13;
3.08          Directed credit reduction. Prior to 1987, directed credit was an important feature of the&#13;
controlled financial sector; preferential rediscounts at the BCT and subsidized loans available to investors&#13;
through the banking system (funded by the GOT and external sources) accounted for 40% of total lending in&#13;
the system. Investments in tourism were the major beneficiaries of subsidized lending, with total subsidies&#13;
4      Central Bank's circular no. 92/15 to all banks, June 29, 1992.&#13;
All banks using their own resources to finance priority activities are compensated by a supplemental margin of&#13;
1.8 to 2.8% according to the type of credit made and based on the prevailing MMR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
amounting to about 27% of the investment cost (including benefits in the form of tax holidays). Since 1987,&#13;
these programs have decreased in importance to about 24% of total credit to the economy in 1992 of which 40%&#13;
was from external resources. Rediscount rates at BCT are positive in real terms (6% to 9.5%, depending on&#13;
the activity). As part of current financial reforms, the recourse to rediscounting at the Central Bank to finance&#13;
the banking sector has been eliminated. The new unified investment code does not provide for subsidized&#13;
interest rates and replaces subsidized lending for investments with fiscal benefits and capital subsidies on&#13;
selected investments; in particular, it allows capital subsidies for investments by farmers in rainfed areas,&#13;
micro-enterprises, and other small groups of beneficiaries, which together account for a maximum of 5% of&#13;
total lending to the economy. This compares well with many other developing countries.&#13;
3.09          Strengthening the supervisory and regulatory framework. The GOT is committed to a four-&#13;
pronged approach to minimizing the likelihood of a financial crisis as the sector is being liberalized. First.&#13;
prudential regulations on provisioning and capital adequacy (Cooke ratio of equity to risk-weighted assets with&#13;
a minimum requirement of 5%) have been strengthened. Second, the BCT is emphasizing on-site inspection&#13;
of asset quality and adherence to more rigorous accounting rules. This includes loan classification rules with&#13;
five asset classes, from class zero to class four according to increasing potential risk, and based on aging of&#13;
arrears (90, 180, and 360 days) linked to strict provisioning rules (20% of loan amounts in class two, 50% in&#13;
class three, and 100% in class four). Third, the existing banking law was amended to increase BCT's powers&#13;
to enforce sound prudential practices and impose financial discipline on banks, including limits on risk&#13;
concentration.6 Fourth and finally, the BCT has implemented a program for auditing and inspecting banks,&#13;
based on accounting principles following international norms. The transition for full compliance by all banks&#13;
with these regulations, which are strictly enforced, is expected to be up to five years for some banks.&#13;
3.10          In September 1994, the following conditions for the release of the third tranche of the EFRSL&#13;
were met: (i) the individual financial position of each audited or inspected bank operating in Tunisia had been&#13;
jointly reviewed by the Tunisian authorities and the Bank, based on internationally accepted banking and audit&#13;
standards previously agreed with the Bank; (ii) satisfactory action plans for all reviewed banks had been&#13;
adopted by their respective boards and are being implemented; (iii) the Central Bank had adopted a program.&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, for auditing and examining the overall viability of all remaining Tunisian banks. These&#13;
banks have launched audits, most of which--and this includes BNA--have been completed.&#13;
C. Agricultural Credit&#13;
3.11          GOT Approach to Agricultural Credit and Institutions. GOT has, since the early sixties,&#13;
been directly involved in agricultural credit; it considers agricultural credit as an important tool to assist all&#13;
farm households, large and small. This latter category, including subsistence and noncreditworthy small farms.&#13;
represents about two thirds of the farm population. The financial effort has been substantial; it involved&#13;
subsidized interest rates to agriculture and linked credit programs with grants to all categories of farmers,&#13;
including those who were not creditworthy. In times of adverse climatic conditions, it intervened through&#13;
postponement or forgiveness of interest and principal repayments.&#13;
3.12          On the institutional side, to allocate and deliver credit, it created in 1959 (para. 4.01) a national&#13;
agricultural credit bank, expanded into a multipurpose commercial bank in 1969, which developed a country-&#13;
wide branch network to make credit accessible, including to small- and medium- size farms. This bank&#13;
conducted credit operations on its own resources, but also administered direct GOT credit lines aimed&#13;
principally at small farmers. GOT also attempted to promote and develop farmers' associations, at the village&#13;
level, which would handle the credit for their members; the members, in turn, would assume mutual&#13;
responsibility for repayment of the loans. In 1963, these took the form of "Caisses Locales de Credit Mutuel"&#13;
(CLCM) and, in 1973, of "Societes de Caution Mutuelle Agricole' (SCMA). Both CLCM and SCMA played&#13;
a minor role in lending to small farmers; these were saddled with arrears which GOT had to assume. GOT&#13;
6      Central Bank's circular No. 91/24 to all banks, December 17, 1991.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
in its desire and concern to reach small farmers maintained an interventionist policy in agricultural operations&#13;
but, over time, allowed market rates in lending to larger farmers.&#13;
3.13          Reorientation in GOT Agricultural Credit. In the mid-eighties, GOT altered the orientation&#13;
of its economic policy and undertook broad reforms to build a more efficient, market-oriented and outward-&#13;
looking economy. In agricultural credit, it introduced major policy reforms to gradually eliminate the interest&#13;
rate differential between agricultural and market rates and to disengage GOT from direct involvement in credit&#13;
operations. There has been progress in implementing these changes but they need to be pursued further. Most&#13;
interest rates including in agriculture are now free, and rates which remain regulated by the Central Bank (at&#13;
10% to 11 % for the so-called priority activities) are above market rates (8.8% since November 1993), but in&#13;
view of the high risks involved (drought), agricultural lending remains financially unattractive to most banks.&#13;
Over the last four years (1990-93), despite good progress in the policy environment, the legacy of the past&#13;
appeared in the form of high accumulated arrears on Government-sponsored credit programs. After restructuring&#13;
in 1994, the number of these programs was reduced from 48 to four with full implementation effect in March&#13;
1995, and volumes have sharply decreased but the past situation has weakened the agricultural credit system&#13;
at a time when it is expected that the banking sector will assume an increasing role in the rural credit delivery&#13;
system.&#13;
3.14          GOT policies have shaped the present agricultural credit system in which the lead bank for&#13;
agriculture, BNA (a major commercial bank in Tunisia, renamed after the merger in 1989 of the National Bank&#13;
of Tunisia--BNT created in 1969, and of a small bank, the National Agricultural Development Bank--BNDA&#13;
created in 1983), dominates formal lending to agriculture and the rural sector. BNA's share capital (40%&#13;
private) is priced at the stock exchange of Tunis. Other commercial banks have concentrated on financing&#13;
commercial and industrial activities, including short-term financing of agro-industry and of imports of cereals,&#13;
and prefinancing of exports. Because of the high risks and entry costs into rural finance, other banks have been&#13;
reluctant to lend for agricultural investment and input supply, especially for small-and medium-scale farmers.&#13;
D. Main Instruments and Institutions in the Rural Financial Sector&#13;
3.15          The main instruments and institutions influencing rural finance are: (i) the BCT instruments&#13;
for regulating the financing of priority activities (para. 3.07); (ii) the GOT credit lines; (iii) the Fonds&#13;
National de Garantie (FNG); (iv) the private sector insurance agencies; and (v) the Agricultural Investment&#13;
Promotion Agency (APIA).&#13;
3.16          BCT Regulating of Priority Activities Lending.  BCT's principal instruments of control&#13;
include setting some of the interest rates banks can charge small farmers. The latter is used mainly to finance&#13;
short-term credit for production as well as for marketing operations (para. 3.07). Besides this tool, BCT has&#13;
also introduced since 1987 a credit/deposit ratio for the financing by commercial banks of priority activities&#13;
(agricultural production, exports, small scale enterprises, and energy-saving activities). Each bank is required&#13;
to have at least 10% of its core deposits loaned out to these priority activities (BCT 's circular No. 89-16 of&#13;
May 17, 1989).&#13;
3.17           With the gradual liberalization of prices to farmers and the liberalization of the financial&#13;
markets, interest rates to agriculture have been gradually adjusted upwards over the last five years. Table I&#13;
shows the progress made since 1987:&#13;

/c   Priority activities loans in agriculture account for 2.6% of BNA's commitments in 1994.&#13;
3.18           The successive adjustments slowed down in 1988 and 1989, in agreement with the Bank,&#13;
following droughts that severely affected the agricultural sector. In view of these circumstances, progress has&#13;
been commendable. Interest rates paid by farmers are, since 1990, positive in real terms and have now reached&#13;
no less than 10%, and are above the MMR. For the remaining regulated rates (para. 3.07) the banks' margin&#13;
is 4%. It allows BNA to cover its operating costs and provisions for credit risk as soon as a substantial&#13;
improvement is made in recovery rates (paras. 6.10 and 6.11). This implies maintaining operational the&#13;
climatic risk mechanism (para. 3.23) to allow the banks and the farming community to better manage risks.&#13;
3.19           GOT Credit Lines.  These credit schemes, which began in the sixties, aimed at helping&#13;
potentially creditworthy subsistence farmers and small farmers who had no access to formal credit. The&#13;
rationale was that small farmers could not increase their production/income because of credit shortage, and that&#13;
different organizations were needed to allocate credit as the delivery system of the ex-BNT gave limited access&#13;
to credit by many farmers. The number of schemes, small in the sixties and seventies, had grown to some 48&#13;
funds and accounts. These were funded through budgetary appropriations and donor funds (loans and grants).&#13;
They were managed by project authorities, regional offices (CRDAs) of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA),&#13;
the Governorates, and, in some cases, BNT. The CRDAs identified and prepared subprojects for financing as&#13;
part of their extension activities. They were also monitoring farm investments after the loans and subsidies had&#13;
been approved. BNT's role was mainly to disburse and collect loans and to keep the accounts against a fee&#13;
varying from 1.5 to 3% of loan amount. Competing lines of credit at low interest rates and diverse procedures&#13;
had not only complicated the management of these lines but had also created confusion for the borrower between&#13;
credit and income transfers. These credit lines, when used without other development measures, had a limited&#13;
impact on farm development. Recovery under this system over the years has been below 55%. In 1992 it was&#13;
53%. Under the Fourth Agricultural Credit Project (1988-1991), GOT had accepted the principle of the&#13;
fungibility of funds, agreed to harmonize the terms and conditions of these various lines, and accepted to&#13;
gradually transfer the credit risk to the banking sector.&#13;
3.20          In 1993, GOT opted to disengage itself from countrywide direct agricultural credit operations&#13;
and BNA established a "Supervised Credit Unit" responsible for developing and promoting credit operations&#13;
to potentially creditworthy farmers previously beneficiaries of GOT credit lines. Under this supervised credit&#13;
program, BNA appraises and approves the loans and receives the support from MOA's extension services in&#13;
identifying and selecting the beneficiaries and in providing technical assistance to the farmers during supervision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(See part A of Annex 9). GOT has refocused its credit assistance to the households living in the poorest rural&#13;
areas by integrating its remaining credit programs with other actions such as irrigation, reforestation, land&#13;
conservation and other rural works, and/or by supporting the development of specific action programs such as&#13;
olive production.&#13;
3.21         To achieve these poverty-oriented programs/projects GOT has maintained four funds out of a&#13;
total of 48, i.e., FOSDA, FODERI, PAAF, and F.S.Oleicole.7 Interest rates under these restructured funds&#13;
are similar to those applied by the banking sector for priority activities except for FODERI where a rate of 6%&#13;
will be applied. With regard to the 44 phased-out funds having a total of outstanding loans of TD 133 million&#13;
to fall due over the period 1994-2012, Parliament approved, February 8, 1994, a law (Law No. 94-30 of&#13;
February 21, 1994) to gradually transfer the amounts due to BNA into a quasi-equity fund (fonds de dotation&#13;
non remboursable) open in BNA's accounts in 1994.&#13;
3.22         These are critical policy changes within the framework of restructuring and shifting credit&#13;
operations from GOT to the banking system. The implementation details are spelled out in two agreements&#13;
between GOT and BNA signed in March 1995:&#13;
(a)    One agreement on the transfer of amounts due (for a total of TD 133 million) under GOT&#13;
restructured credit lines, and on the implementation modalities of the guarantee on the&#13;
shortfalls; period for transfer is established at a maximum of 20 years: BNA will collect, each&#13;
year, the recoverable portion (total estimated at about 50%) of farmers' dues on these lines, and&#13;
the unpaid portion is guaranteed by the GOT through annual budget allocations until BNA has&#13;
reached its financial equilibrium; and&#13;
(b)    One agreement on the precise role and responsibilities (disbursement on behalf of GOT within&#13;
budget limits, and bookkeeping with separate, off-balance sheet accounts), and remuneration&#13;
of BNA for managing on behalf of GOT the remaining funds (FOSDA, FODERI, PAAF, and&#13;
F. S. Oleicole) to cover 100% of administrative and management cost plus incentives on&#13;
recovery performance.&#13;
3.23         The National Guarantee Fund (FNG). In 1981, GOT established the FNG (Fonds National&#13;
de Garantie), which guarantees loans made by commercial banks to small- and medium-scale enterprises for&#13;
all sectors, including agriculture. The FNG is capitalized through automatic premium payments made by&#13;
beneficiaries through banking operations, plus reserves. At the end of 1994, total accumulated resources&#13;
amounted to TD 48 million. The FNG, however, which is operational since 1984 in its initial form (and was&#13;
managed by BCT until 1993), was not conceived to protect farmers against climatic risk. The GOT amended&#13;
the implementation decree of the FNG, November 22, 1993, to cover drought risk, and the FNG, since 1994,&#13;
is administered by an insurance company (Tunis-Re). The GOT confirmed in March 1995 that this new drought&#13;
risk management scheme has been made fully operational. Eligibility criteria to the modified FNG were spelled&#13;
out in July 1994, and implementation modalities in March 1995 (para. 6.12).&#13;
3.24         Agricultural Insurance.  The Compagnie Tunisienne d'Assurances Mutuelles Agricoles&#13;
(CTAMA), a farmers' mutual since 1912, insures against fire and hail damage to crops, livestock and&#13;
greenhouses, among other things, for commercial agriculture. BNA requires its borrowers to purchase hail and&#13;
fire insurance. However, drought is not covered by private insurers ( Annex 6).&#13;
FOSDA:      Special Fund for Agricultural Development;&#13;
FODERI:    Special Fund for Rural Integrated Development;&#13;
PAAF:       Citrus and other Fruit-tree Program (new plantations);&#13;
F.S. Oleicole: Special Olive-tree Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
3.25         The Agricultural Investment Promotion Agency (APIA). Through its new Unified Investment&#13;
Code8 (law No. 93-120 of December 27, 1993), GOT promotes and encourages investments in the agricultural--&#13;
fisheries sector, to improve productivity, efficiency and employment. The law provides for fiscal advantages,&#13;
such as tax deductions, duty free imports of livestock and seeds, and/or direct financial support through grants&#13;
ranging from 10% for investments in equipment to 25% for water conservation actions. APIA, under the&#13;
direction of MOA, is responsible for approving the agricultural investments eligible for benefits (API is&#13;
responsible for industrial investments).  For those investments eligible under the code, the beneficiary bank&#13;
loan is reduced by the amount of the contribution/grant. BNA works closely with APIA.&#13;
3.26         Rural Poverty9 Alleviation Program. Subsistence farmers not eligible for bank credit amount&#13;
to about 267,000 (Annex 1). Some of them are potentially creditworthy. To help these poor rural families, the&#13;
GOT has developed a poverty alleviation program (Programme de Developpement Rural Integre--PDRI). The&#13;
objectives of the PDRI are to improve living conditions, increase production and income (farm and off-farm),&#13;
and improve employment. Budget resources allocated to the PDRI finance the development of rural&#13;
infrastructure, including sanitation, rural electrification and drinking water (TD 350 million in five years). The&#13;
FODERI (about 2,000 beneficiaries and TD 8 million per year) is the rural credit instrument of this program&#13;
(24% recovered). Another small fund (OPEC) provides credit to micro-enterprises (petits metiers) with a 30%&#13;
recovery rate. Decisions are made by the regional Governorates. The PDRI has laudable goals but a joint GOT-&#13;
FAO evaluation conducted in April 1993 (Working Document No.22) shows that the program got mixed results&#13;
and needs to be revamped (not part of this project).&#13;
IV. THE BANQUE NATIONALE AGRICOLE&#13;
A. Organization and Staffing&#13;
Background&#13;
4.01         In 1959, the GOT established a Banque Nationale Agricole (BNA) as a specialized agricultural&#13;
credit institution and, for the following ten years, its activities were concentrated mainly in that sector. In 1969,&#13;
the GOT decided to transform this bank into a multipurpose commercial bank (BNT). The decision to diversify&#13;
the institution's operations and to maintain its viability as a financial institution was complemented by GOT&#13;
entrusting to BNT the management of numerous special subsidized agricultural credit programs, including the&#13;
important Special Fund for Agricultural Development (FOSDA). In October 1989, BNT was merged with&#13;
BNDA which was created in 1983 to provide financing to large farmers and to agricultural enterprises. The&#13;
new BNT was renamed the Banque Nationale Agricole (BNA).&#13;
4.02         BNA currently occupies a unique position in the Tunisian banking system as it provides most&#13;
of the financing extended to the agricultural sector while also being one of the two largest commercial banks&#13;
in Tunisia, with an extensive network of regional and branch offices, further explained below.&#13;
4.03          Until 1993, only part of agricultural credit operations were carried out under the responsibility&#13;
and risk assumption of ex-BNT and BNA (66% of total in 1992), while the other part (34%) was carried out&#13;
by GOT but managed by the bank, on behalf of GOT, for a fee. (Reforms were completed in March 1995 to&#13;
phase out most GOT's credit programs, paras 3.20 to 3.22).&#13;
Code d'incitations aux Investissements&#13;
A Poverty Assessment for Tunisia is available: "Poverty Alleviation: Preserving Progress while Preparing for&#13;
the Future" (GC Report No. 13993-TUIN, April 1995).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
Organization&#13;
4.04          In March 1993, BNA put in place a new organizational structure at its headquarters (see Chart&#13;
at end of Supporting Tables) which eliminates duplications and regroups various departments under the authority&#13;
of eight central directorates. These directorates correspond to the various functions that BNA is fulfilling in&#13;
its role of multipurpose bank (Agricultural Lending Operations, Commercial and Industrial Lending Operations,&#13;
International Operations) as well as its own needs as a financial institution (Organization and Data Processing,&#13;
Financial Affairs and Treasury, Branch Network Management, Human Resources and Administrative Services,&#13;
Legal).&#13;
4.05          The departments within each central directorate are responsible for the various phases of the&#13;
activities of the directorate. For instance, the Central Directorate for Agricultural Lending Operations includes&#13;
four departments, two of which are in charge of appraising loans, one in charge of implementation and&#13;
supervision and one responsible for loan collection.&#13;
4.06          The new structure is adequate to allow BNA to fulfill its role of multipurpose bank. However,&#13;
within the context of a necessary improvement of the automated management tools and of a greater&#13;
decentralization of operational responsibilities toward the regional offices, some adjustments will need to be&#13;
made to the structure.&#13;
4.07          BNA's field organization at the end of 1994 includes 15 regional offices and 140 branch&#13;
offices. Four regional offices (Bizerte, Sfax, Sousse and Gabes) are decentralized, which means that they have&#13;
some decision-making powers regarding their operations that the non-decentralized regional offices do not have&#13;
(e.g. credit decisions on new loans up to specified ceilings, roll over of existing loans, short-term overdrafts,&#13;
and personnel/legal matters). BNA's management is committed in its action plan (para.4.18) to strengthen the&#13;
institution, and to pursue the delegation of operational authority to the branch network by giving the&#13;
decentralized status to three additional regional offices per year. BNA is currently considering the possibility&#13;
of also giving them more decision-making authority for loan approvals and collection of arrears. BNA's&#13;
decentralization of operations will be feasible only to the extent that, in parallel, it implements a modern&#13;
management information system, an effective internal audit and strengthens the inspection function.&#13;
Management&#13;
4.08          BNA is administered by a Board of Directors and a President Director General (PDG) who is&#13;
the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Board includes representatives from&#13;
the Prime Minister's Office and from the ministries of Finance, Economic Development, and Agriculture, from&#13;
the National Cereals Board (OC), the National Olive Oil Board (ONH), the Trade Board of Tunisia, and from&#13;
the private sector (40% of BNA's capital) including the Tunisian Agricultural Mutual Insurance Company&#13;
(CTAMA). A financial controller is appointed by the Ministry of Finance to monitor and report on BNA's&#13;
compliance with pertinent laws. BNA's financial statements are audited annually by an independent auditor.&#13;
4.09          A new PDG/CEO was nominated in mid-1992. After consultation with the senior staff of the&#13;
institution, he proceeded with the preparation of broad strategic orientations for the bank (1992-2000) which&#13;
includes a general policy statement (Working File No 16). BNA's Board of Directors approved these new&#13;
policy orientations and strategic agenda December 11, 1992. In parallel, he proceeded with the restructuring&#13;
of the headquarters as described in paragraphs 4.04 to 4.07, in line with the new strategic orientations. He is&#13;
also decentralizing operational decision-making authority to the regional offices in a gradual manner and&#13;
introducing more efficient and client-oriented business practices and processes. New policies are also designed&#13;
to shift BNA's own culture towards a more consistent emphasis on the management of operations and risks.&#13;
Furthermore, he is developing a strong training program in line with BNA's new policies. There are clear&#13;
indications that the new President is determined to set the institution on a sound financial footing and to improve&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
significantly its effectiveness as a multi-purpose commercial bank. BNA's top management is experienced and&#13;
competent.&#13;
Staffing&#13;
4.10          While on December 31, 1987, BNA's total staff numbered 2,136, seven years later at the end&#13;
of 1994, it totalled 2,981 persons, an increase of 40%. During the period 1989-1992, the staff increased at a&#13;
faster rate than in preceding years, mainly because of the merger of BNT and BNDA into BNA in 1989.&#13;
However, to contain costs, the number of staff hired every year is decreasing since 1992 (from 185 new&#13;
positions in 1992 to 145 in 1993 and 129 in 1994). Priority for recruitment is given to functions understaffed.&#13;
4.11          Between 1987 and 1993, the proportion of staff in management positions has increased from&#13;
6 to 8.7%, while the proportion of professionals has risen significantly from 18 to 31 %. During the same period&#13;
the proportion of support staff has declined from 76 to 60% of total staff.&#13;
4.12          In 1987, there was an almost equal number of staff at headquarters and in field offices. Every&#13;
year thereafter, the proportion of field staff has increased and, at the end of 1994, 1,315 staff members (44%&#13;
of the total) were working at headquarters while 1,666 (56%) were operating in field offices (regional offices&#13;
and branch offices). This reflects BNA policy to strengthen its branch network through opening new offices.&#13;
Forty-six new branches were opened in the last five years.&#13;
4.13          At the end of 1994, BNA's staff included 2,236 men (about 75% of the total) and 745 women&#13;
(25%). In 1994, 80 women were hired out of the 129 new recruitments done. In 1987, the proportion of&#13;
women in BNA's staff was about 21 %. While the proportion of women in support staff positions rose by 3 %&#13;
(from 26 to 29%) between 1987 and 1994, the proportion of women in management positions rose from 6 to&#13;
10%, and that of women in the professional category increased 2.5 times to reach 22% of BNA's staff in that&#13;
category. This indicates that BNA is implementing a more equal rights policy in its personnel recruitment and&#13;
promotions.&#13;
4.14          Because of the nature of its operations as a universal bank, BNA employs specialists in various&#13;
areas, e.g. financial analysts (211), economists (198), agronomists (24), and personnel specialists (8). In terms&#13;
of level of education, 772 staff members have bachelor's degrees, 542 have a master's degree or a doctorate.&#13;
Staff training&#13;
4.15          BNA's staff training activities in recent years are summarized in Table 2:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
4.16         In recent years, BNA's training activities have fluctuated widely. The percentage of staff that&#13;
received training in any given year exceeded 40% only once, in 1993; 40% is usually considered the desirable&#13;
fraction to keep staff abreast of rapid changes in their professional fields. In summary, it appears that, until&#13;
recently, although some attempt was made to develop training activities on a systematic basis by the preparation&#13;
of a five-year training plan, BNA, in the past, did not actually give the training function the significance that&#13;
it deserves (Annex 2).&#13;
4.17          Fortunately, this situation is in the process of changing as BNA's new management has clearly&#13;
indicated that it gives a high priority to staff training. Much needs to be done to compensate for past&#13;
deficiencies. In particular, the following actions are being taken: (a) BNA is defining the function of "trainer";&#13;
(b) BNA has prepared a four-year training plan as part of its action plan (para. 4.18 (f)), taking into account&#13;
BNA's most urgent needs, and expected needs deriving from its new activities.&#13;
BNA Institutional and Financial Development Plan&#13;
4. 18         From its broad institutional vision (para. 4.09) and strategic statement updated in September&#13;
1993 (a strong multilevel planning process will be formulated under the project, see paras. 5.12 b and 6.08 a),&#13;
BNA's management had developed an action plan for 1994-1996 and has started its implementation. This action&#13;
plan was extended to 1997 in December 1994 and updated in February 1995, and will be revised semi-annually.&#13;
It is composed of measures addressing: financial restructuring, financial profitability, credit policies and&#13;
institutional strengthening including training. The plan contains:&#13;
(a)    a development plan which integrates credit policies and all operational, financial and staffing&#13;
aspects of BNA's activities;&#13;
(b)   the design of a strategic information system;&#13;
(c)   the implementation of a new accounting system that responds better to changing needs;&#13;
(d)   the implementation of an information system that will make it possible for management to&#13;
monitor more effectively BNA's activities and risks;&#13;
(e)   the strengthening of the internal audit function and management control;&#13;
(f)   the strengthening of the capabilities of the training center and the preparation of a training&#13;
program that responds to the strategic needs of the institution;&#13;
(g)   the implementation of a new recruitment policy based on BNA's projected staffing needs; and&#13;
(h)   the progressive decentralization of operations to a modernized branch network and its extension&#13;
to geographic areas having a strategic and commercial interest.&#13;
The BNA's Action Plan (updated to 1997 and with 1994 actuals) is presented in Annex 3. It includes financial&#13;
and development impact indicators and intermediate indicators that will be used, during project implementation,&#13;
to monitor the financial and managerial performance of BNA. BNA's Action Plan for the period 1995-1997&#13;
was adopted by its Board of Directors on February 28, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. Agricultural Lending Operations&#13;
BNA's Share in Agricultural Credit&#13;
4.19          Although a multi-sectoral bank, the BNA is providing most of total banking investment rural&#13;
credit in Tunisia (Table 11). Other commercial banks lend to agro-processors, a few large farmers and&#13;
enterprises. BNA is the only bank servicing smaliholders, hence the focus on BNA in this project.&#13;
C. Financial Situation and Performance&#13;
4.20          Financial Condition. BNA is the largest bank in Tunisia in terms of total resources (TD 2,962&#13;
million at the end of 1994), branch network (140 branches at the end of 1994), and lending to the economy and&#13;
deposit/savings mobilization, which represent respectively about 31 % and 19% of total lending and total deposit&#13;
mobilization by the banking sector in Tunisia. It is also the largest lender to the agricultural sector. BNA's&#13;
commercial and industrial activities represented 73% of total operations and agricultural activities, including&#13;
GOT operations, 27% end 1993. BNA's summary balance sheets for the period 1988-1994 are presented in&#13;
Table 13.&#13;
4.21          Over the period  1989-1993, the total balance sheet has grown from TD 1,947 million to&#13;
TD 3,129 (3,043 after deducting credit risk provisions from risk assets) on an average annual increase of about&#13;
12%. With respect to the use of resources, the relative importance of loans granted by BNA own resources&#13;
has grown over the same period from 45% to 60%; while the GOT funded loans (special resources) remained&#13;
at the 15% level. With respect to sources of funds, the financial structure (before recapitalization in 1994 to&#13;
meet new prudential regulations on capital adequacy) remains weak due to a restated net worth as of 1992 to&#13;
take account of provision shortfalls (para.4.22), and to a heavy reliance on short-term borrowing. BNA Action&#13;
Plan for 1995-1997 is addressing this (Annex 3).&#13;
4.22          Overall Operating Results and Profitability.   Table 14 shows BNA's audited income&#13;
statements for 1988-1993 and 1994 results. The surplus earned by BNA on its commercial and industrial&#13;
operations have, in the past, covered the losses on agricultural operations (Table 4) but left little room to build&#13;
up larger provisions for credit risks. With the adoption of the new prudential regulations, the shortfall of&#13;
provisions for restated credit risks is TD 201 million in 1994, down from TD 238 million in 1993 and from&#13;
TD 249 million in 1992, out of which two clients (ONH and OC) counted for about 70% in 1992 and 1993.&#13;
This shortfall is estimated to decrease to TD 180 million in 1995. As agreed with the international external&#13;
auditors (and BCT), there is a five to six-year transition period to fully reflect this shortfall in operating results&#13;
(Table 5). Profitability is therefore calculated accordingly.  Should provision shortfalls be incorporated&#13;
immediately without transition period, BNA would show no earnings from 1992 to 1997 or 1998.&#13;
4.23          Loan Portfolio Quality.  Asset class four (high risk of loss) represented 10%  of BNA's&#13;
classified portfolio (nonperforming loans of ex-BNDA) in 1992 and 1993. ONH and OC (class two, and&#13;
solutions are under way to reduce exposure--para. 4.27 (v)) represented 40%. BNA's financial results have been&#13;
affected by: (i) financing an expanding portfolio, which more than doubled from 1988 to 1993, through short-&#13;
term borrowing at high money market rates thereby increasing its average financial costs from 4.4% in 1988&#13;
to 7.9% in 1992 while average revenues increased only from 7.8% to 10.1 % over the same period;&#13;
(ii) financing shortfalls in GOT budgetary resources, amounting to 56 MD at the end of 1993, for GOT credit&#13;
lines without arrangements for compensation at the time (estimated interest at TD 6 million for 1993 and&#13;
accumulated, since 1988, for over TD 25 million); and (iii) financing frozen assets in the form of arrears&#13;
amounting to TD 395 million. Collection perfornance is poor, in particular on GOT credit schemes for which&#13;
BNA does not assume the risk, and has deteriorated the past years. An analysis of the 1992 classified assets&#13;
(adequate provisions are required for about 73% of risk assets in class two, three and four) led BNA, in 1993,&#13;
to take strong remedial measures (see paras 4.27 and 6.10), to avoid further erosion of capital at BNA, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
to rebuild credit discipline. The table below summarizes (at the end of 1992) the arrears situation in relation&#13;
to lending activities:&#13;

/a Arrears to loans ratio was 33% for BNA's agricultural portfolio at BNA's risk. On GOT risk schemes, the&#13;
arrears/loans ratio was 45 %. Total arrears/total loans ratio for BNA was 15% in 1992. Trends on arrears in 1993&#13;
and 1994 are aggravated by a severe drought in 1993-94 (Tables 20 and 22).&#13;
Financial Situation of Agricultural Activities&#13;
4.24           BNA's own resources were used principally to finance short-term  loans; these credits are&#13;
recovered at 90% on average. Medium- and long-term loans were principally financed with resources provided&#13;
by GOT or obtained through external loans. The average recovery on these programs was below 50% on GOT&#13;
programs and about 75% on external loans.&#13;
4.25           Agricultural arrears situation.  The recovery rate"0 of agricultural loans, BNA and GOT&#13;
operations combined, has declined from 79% in 1988 to 70% in 1994 (Tables 20 and 22). The total recovery&#13;
rate on BNA loans, for which it assumes approval and full risk, was 90 % in 1988 and dropped to 83 % in 1994.&#13;
In comparison, the recovery rate on GOT operations and external loans combined was 60% in 1988 and only&#13;
46% in 1994. Adverse climatic conditions explain the unsatisfactory results in certain years (1988-89 and 1993-&#13;
94), but even under normal climatic conditions the overall recovery performance is poor. In addition to drought&#13;
and debt rescheduling, weak loan management of the various credit lines--combined to the transfer to BNT/BNA&#13;
of the non-performing portfolio of the ex-BNDA representing 30% of current agricultural arrears--have&#13;
contributed to poor repayment performance. As of December 31, 1993, total arrears in agriculture are TD 253&#13;
million. Aging (GOT and BNA combined) is as follows: 30% of arrears are less than 2 years; 48% are more&#13;
than 2 years but less than 5 years; and 22% more than 5 years.&#13;
4.26           Financial Results. The consolidated results of the agricultural operations of BNA and the GOT&#13;
are summarized in Table 4 (see also Tables 13 and 14 for BNA).&#13;
IS     Recovery rate at BNA is currently calculated on total collection at the end of the year on principal, after payment&#13;
of interest due. In the future, BNA will also calculate rates on arrears collection and on current collection, interest&#13;
plus principal. On short-term loans, interests due are prepaid at the time loans are disbursed.&#13;

/a  The ex-BNDA portfolio, taken over after the merger with BNT in 1989, led to a loss of TD 6 million in 1993&#13;
Besides the low recovery rate on GOT operations, there are other factors which have so far contributed to the&#13;
negative profitability of the agricultural credit system. On the income side the revenues grew slowly because&#13;
of delayed adjustments in interest rate (drought, see para. 3.18) and the insufficient commission paid by the&#13;
GOT to BNA for administering its budgetary operations (1 .5% on the average outstanding balance while costs&#13;
are at 2%--this 0.5% represents for 1992 and 1993 an annual loss of income of TD 1.4 million). On the&#13;
expenditure side there are TD 6.4 million additional financial costs (interest expenses at MMR) for advances&#13;
made by BNA on shortfalls of GOT budgetary resources. The BNA advances on GOT operations amounted to&#13;
TD 55.9 million (plus interest due) at the end of 1993. These problems are being addressed by GOT and BNA&#13;
but to restore profitability, a better level of debt collection must also be attained (paras. 6-10 and 6-11).&#13;
BNA's Organizational and Financial Reform Achievements and Key Remaining Issues&#13;
4.27          To reverse past trends, BNA's management has started to take measures to strengthen its internal&#13;
organization (para. 4.04) and to restructure its finances. With regard to the latter: (i) BNA's Board has decided&#13;
to double its capital by two successive increases, one in March 1994, and one in December 1994; (ii) as decided&#13;
by BCT for all banks, in mid-1992 BNA increased its interest rate on priority agricultural activities to 10%&#13;
(lending to large farmers was already at MMR + 3% and are free since June 1994) and with the MMR&#13;
dropping to 8.8%  in November 1993 from  11 % the average cost of money is also decreasing; (iii) BNA&#13;
borrowed US $60 million long-term from the ADB at 8.5% and is in the process of issuing long term bonds&#13;
at 7.5% on the national market in order to reduce its dependency on short-term borrowing; (iv) BNA has&#13;
prepared a recovery plan for both BNA and GOT arrears in March 1993 and implementation has started; and&#13;
(v) GOT has taken important steps, first, to disengage itself from credit operations (paras. 3.19 and 3.20)&#13;
thereby ending the confusion created between credit (reimbursable) and income transfers to farmers (government&#13;
grants), second, to consolidate the amounts due from the phased out GOT credit lines in the form of a quasi-&#13;
capital transfer (TD133 million), third, by deciding on March 24, 1995 to fully repay to BNA by end 1998&#13;
past advances made by BNA for past GOT credit operations (balance due of TD 54 million as of&#13;
December 31, 1994, principal and interests); and fourth, by reducing BNA's overdraft exposure to large public&#13;
enterprises as already done in 1994 for the National Olive Oil Board (ONH). Similar measures are expected&#13;
to reduce BNA's exposure to the National Cereals Board (OC) and the Chemical Group (Groupe chimique) by&#13;
June 30, 1996.&#13;
4.28   This package of measures and the agreements mentioned in para. 3.22 will strengthen BNA financially&#13;
in the immediate future, and further adjustments may be needed once the results of the recovery plan are known;&#13;
but in the next two years, one crucial factor to transform BNA into a strong autonomous financial organization&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
will be to what extent BNA can ensure a level of collection over 95%. The proposed project, which arrives&#13;
at this opportune and critical time when fundamental reforms to restructure the agricultural credit system are&#13;
taking place, would strongly support the rehabilitation of BNA and GOT's objectives to create a more friendly&#13;
environment for the banking system to serve all segments of the farm population, including small farmers.&#13;
D. BNA's Projected Financial Situation&#13;
4.29           BNA's projected balance sheets and income statements, with key assumptions"l for the period&#13;
1995-1998 are presented in Tables 16 to 18. They have been prepared on the basis of the objectives established&#13;
by BNA's management, as expressed in the institution's strategic plan. BNA's projected financial indicators,&#13;
based on a low-case scenario (see assumptions in Table 16), are presented in the table below:&#13;

for full implementation by all Tunisian banks. The provision shortfalls will have a gradual impact on BNA's income statements.&#13;
The above data show that BNA's financial situation is expected to improve significantly in coming years as a&#13;
result of the measures already taken and in the process of being taken by GOT (paras. 3.22 and 4.27 (v)) and&#13;
BNA (para 4.27 (i)).   BNA's management has also taken measures to improve the quality of its portfolio&#13;
by applying stricter lending criteria and provisioning rules. In full compliance with BCT's new prudential&#13;
regulations, BNA's capital adequacy (Cooke ratio) which was negative in 1993 (-5%) improved to 2% in&#13;
March 1994 (audited) and, with the strengthening of BNA internal organization and financial structure, is&#13;
expected to reach 5% as of June 30, 1996. BNA management's objective is to reach about 8% in 1998.&#13;
Liquidity, defined as the ratio of loans (including overdrafts) to deposits would improve to a more acceptable&#13;
level by 1998. Net financial intermediation margin (see definition in para. 6.08(c) footnote), is expected to&#13;
be maintained above a minimum acceptable of 2%. BNA's financial indicators, in particular the liquidity,&#13;
profitability, and capital adequacy ratio as well as collection rates and financial intermediation margin will have&#13;
to be closely monitored during Project implementation and the mid-term review in order for BNA to prevent&#13;
or correct any deteriorating trends.&#13;
Estimates have been revised after negotiations in the light of decisions on (i) the settlement of BNA advances&#13;
to GOT; (ii) implementation of the GOT's law on the TD 133 million quasi-capital transfer; and (iii) projected&#13;
settlement of OC and Chemnical Group overdrafts to reduce risk exposure by end June 1996.&#13;

V. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Rationale for Bank Involvement and Project Objectives&#13;
5.01          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's involvement in the rural financial sector of&#13;
Tunisia will be integral to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) articulated in April 1993 by supporting&#13;
government efforts to develop the rural private sector and to alleviate rural poverty. Within this framework,&#13;
the strengthening of the rural financial sector plays a leading role. The financing of agriculture, where&#13;
smallholders predominate and are geographically scattered, is a risky business. Bank involvement through the&#13;
proposed project would help Tunisia in: (i.) broadening and improving the accessibility of agricultural credit&#13;
by developing the sustainable foundations of a sound rural finance system well-integrated into an increasingly&#13;
liberalized financial sector; (ii.) promoting the financial viability of rural lending by separating normal credit&#13;
risk from climatic risk and from income transfers; and (iii.) strengthening the operational capacity of the lead&#13;
bank for agriculture, the BNA. The proposed project is thus a key complement to the on-going macro and&#13;
financial reforms to transform Tunisia into a market driven, private sector economy.&#13;
5.02          Main Focus of the Project and Actions already taken. The project is focussing on key&#13;
institutional changes at the level of the BNA and the GOT. At the level of the BNA, the focus is on an action&#13;
plan with measures needed to improve credit risk management and collection performance so as to develop a&#13;
financially viable bank and sound agricultural portfolio, and to reorganize the bank (Annex 3). These actions&#13;
and measures are consistent with a general action plan of financial sector restructuring within the EFRSL. At&#13;
the level of the GOT, upfront actions have been taken on (i) restructuring and phasing out 44 GOT funded credit&#13;
lines and on the role of BNA for managing at GOT's risk the four remaining GOT lines (para.3.22); and&#13;
(ii) modifying the FNG to protect credit beneficiaries against drought (para. 3.23).&#13;
5.03          Project Objectives:  Institutional and Development Agenda.   Consistent with the&#13;
Government's priorities, the primary objectives of the project are to assist Tunisia in promoting creditworthy&#13;
private investment in rural areas and in strengthening, on a sustainable basis, the financial viability and&#13;
institutional reform process of BNA in order to improve its development impact on the country's rural sector.&#13;
Specifically, the project would assist in the following: (a) supporting the implementation of a sound action plan&#13;
to recapitalize BNA, deal with the arrears problem, and improve BNA's overall profitability; (b) developing&#13;
an effective strategic planning process, decentralized organizational plan and internal controls for BNA to&#13;
implement improved lending policies, risk analysis and client selection. provide credit to all creditworthy&#13;
farmers (including small farmers), and expand financial intermediation (credit and savings) in rural areas; and&#13;
(c) developing a pilot program for the establishment of group lending schemes at village level.&#13;
B. Summary Project Description&#13;
5.04          The proposed project would support the following activities over a four-year implementation&#13;
period (1995-1999).&#13;
(a)    BNA's Credit Program: (i) on-farm processing and marketing investments by creditworthy&#13;
farmers (small, medium and large, including women farmers), cooperatives and enterprises in&#13;
crops and livestock; (ii) fisheries; iii) other rural investments (farm and off-farm), including for&#13;
rural services enterprises and rural women's activities; and (iv) rural housing;&#13;
(b)    BNA's Institutional Development: (i) implementation of a strong strategic and organizational&#13;
plan that aims at strengthening BNA's strategic process, organization structure, its management&#13;
effectiveness by improving its management tools such as the information systems, and&#13;
facilitating the effective decentralization of its operations. This would result into more efficient&#13;
banking functions; the strengthening of BNA's branch offices for intensification of rural&#13;
outreach, loan management for improved identification, supervision and recovery of loans and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
agricultural staff training for effective rural outreach and loan management; (ii) implementation&#13;
of an action plan to absorb BNA's arrears and strengthen its financial situation; and&#13;
(iii) improvement of the transparency of its resources and activities by separating GOT-funded&#13;
credit lines from its regular operations and by establishing a cost accounting system for its&#13;
branch network; and&#13;
(c)   Informal Rural Finance and Group Lending Schemes: developing and carrying out with&#13;
BNA-GOT, by March 31, 1996, a study to assess the feasibility of group lending at village&#13;
level, covering two parts: (i) informal rural markets and the operation of group lending to&#13;
better understand its riskiness, terms, conditions and recovery; and (ii) the institutional&#13;
framework (legal and regulatory) to better understand how best to promote mutual guarantee&#13;
credit groups and credit unions at the village level. By joining together, smallholders can reduce&#13;
costs of borrowing, keep collection rates high and improve access to credit. Based on study&#13;
recommendations, pilot implementation would start by November 1, 1996.&#13;
C. Detailed Features&#13;
BNA Credit Program&#13;
5.05          Investment Lending to small and medium private farmers. This component will finance all&#13;
types of productive agricultural investments for a broad range of small-and medium-size farms. Medium- and&#13;
long-term lending, either for a single operation or a combination of operations, would be in response to market&#13;
demand, which is expected to include a broad spectrum of investments in irrigation development, livestock&#13;
sheds, cattle, sheep, forestry and forage development, agricultural mechanization, tree crop plantations and&#13;
water and soil conservation works. Small and medium farmers would be defined as those who propose to carry&#13;
out a category "A" or "B" investment under the investment code. Their pre-investment net return would&#13;
generally be not more than TD 3,600, based on 1993 prices. The number of beneficiaries is expected to be&#13;
about 23,200, of which 9,400 under the supervised credit program (para. 3.20). The average unit cost per&#13;
single operation would vary from TD 5,000 to TD 10,000 and up to TD 20,000 per integrated or combined&#13;
operation.&#13;
5.06         Investment Lending to Large Farmers. This component would provide medium- and long-&#13;
term credit for all types of productions investments in response to market demand for commercial farmers&#13;
defined as those who propose to carry out a category "C" investment under the investment code. Their pre-&#13;
investment net farm return exceeds TD 3,600 based on 1993 prices. The expected investments include on-farm&#13;
silos in addition to others cited in para. 5.05. The number of beneficiaries is estimated at 2,715. The average&#13;
unit cost per single operation would vary from TD 15,000 to 40,000 and for the integrated or combined&#13;
operations from TD 20,000 to TD 50,000.&#13;
5.07          Investment Lending to Fishermen. Lending to fishermen will cover (a) the supply of engines,&#13;
equipment and fishing gear; (b) small boats for coastal fishing; (c) aquaculture; and (d) the modernization of&#13;
large boats for high-sea fishing. In view of the past poor record of loan recovery, lending under this component&#13;
would be highly selective: particular attention will be given to good records of fishing performance and&#13;
satisfactory recovery rates for credit decisions. The number of coastal fishermen (category "A" and "B"&#13;
investment under the investment code) is expected to be 500 (of which 300 under the supervised credit program)&#13;
and the number of larger fishermen 29 (category "C" investment). The average cost for coastal fishermen&#13;
would vary from TD 30,000 for a single investment to TD 60,000 for a combination of investments, and for&#13;
the modernization of larger and high-sea vessels and aquaculture from TD 200,000 up to TD 650,000.&#13;
5.08          Lending to Service Cooperatives and Medium-Size Enterprises. Under this component,&#13;
subborrowers would mainly be service cooperatives providing on-farm and off-farm in rural areas, individual&#13;
entrepreneurs and tnedium-size enterprises including agro-investors defined as those proposing to carry out an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
investment the cost of which does not exceed TD I million. Subloans would finance civil works, equipment&#13;
and minimum working capital requirements of investments designed to create jobs in rural areas, provide outlets&#13;
for agricultural products, develop new sub-sectors and fill unsaturated market segments in traditional subsectors,&#13;
such as cereal storage, where the private sector is gradually taking over following divestiture in the public&#13;
sector. Most projected investments would be for cold storage facilities, fish, vegetable and fruit (including date)&#13;
processing/packaging plants for both new facilities and upgrading of existing facilities. Service cooperatives&#13;
for small- and medium-size farms would aim at providing on-farm contract works (land preparation, harvesting)&#13;
and marketing services for the supply of farm inputs and the commercialization of farm outputs. The number&#13;
of investors under this component is estimated at 70 with an average unit cost of TD 500,000 per operation.&#13;
In the cereal storage subsector the number of investors would be 60 with a per unit cost averaging TD 400,000.&#13;
5.09          Lending to Agricultural Development Enterprises. This component would provide medium-&#13;
and long-term credit to agro-investors, entrepreneurs and/or medium-size enterprises, in particular those which&#13;
qualify to obtain public land (e.g., long-term lease), previously poorly operated by production cooperatives or&#13;
state farms. Already 45,800 ha have been leased (or sold) to 83 investors and, in accordance with land still&#13;
available, an additional 81 investor-entrepreneurs will start developing some 70,000 - 90,000 ha at an average&#13;
unit cost of TD 750,000 .&#13;
5.10          Lending to Artisans' and Rural Women's Enterprises. The main objective of this component&#13;
is to help artisans and women closely linked to rural activities to start and develop their own entrepreneurial&#13;
activities in handicraft, cottage industries and other productive activities. This component is expected to finance&#13;
about 2,500 beneficiaries at an average unit cost of TD 4,000, and would represent 2.4% of total investment&#13;
under the project.&#13;
5.11          Lending for Construction of Rural Housing. The main objective of this component is to&#13;
provide credit to construct, expand and rehabilitate rural dwellings for farm families, agricultural laborers, rural&#13;
women, and other rural families, so as to improve their living conditions in rural areas. This small component&#13;
would finance about 500 loans varying from TD 5,000 to TD 15,000, mainly for low- and medium-income rural&#13;
families, and would represent about 1.2% of total investment under the project.&#13;
The Indicative project lending program is summarized in Table 16, Part 3.&#13;
Institutional Development&#13;
5.12         Improvement of BNA's Management Systems and Procedures, Financial Performance,&#13;
Planning Process and MIS. The Project would provide for:&#13;
(a)   strengthening BNA's personnel management systems and facilitating the decentralization of&#13;
operations and authority towards the regional offices;&#13;
(b)    helping BNA to formulate and implement a multilevel strategic planning process; and&#13;
(c)   further improving BNA's MIS and accounting and expansion of computerization.&#13;
The project would finance:  (i) The process of formulating a strong strategic development plan (Schnma&#13;
Directeur Strategique), MIS software, data processing and office technology maintenance during a three year&#13;
period at BNA's headquarters and branches; and (ii) related training needs (para. 5.13) and consulting services&#13;
as necessary.&#13;
5.13          Training Program. The Project would fund training by BNA's Training Center with the&#13;
assistance of consultants. The emphasis of the training program will be towards enhancing the managerial&#13;
capabilities of BNA's staff in order to facilitate the decentralization of operations and the use of modern&#13;
techniques in the various areas of BNA's operations. Training will also include courses in investment project&#13;
appraisal and supervision, environmental planning and assessments, and portfolio management for credit staff;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
accounting for middle level and operational staff; planning, programming, MIS, management control, and&#13;
communications skills for senior staff; electronic data processing for computer staff and computer users;&#13;
banking services for branch managers and selected support staff; and risk management. The project would also&#13;
finance small equipment, professional visits overseas for senior managers, and the recruitment of appropriate&#13;
training specialists as necessary.&#13;
5.14          Technical Assistance. Technical assistance would help considerably in facilitating BNA's&#13;
institutional strengthening particularly in the planning process, personnel management and the computerization&#13;
of operations. The Project would finance the expertise necessary to support project implementation and training,&#13;
up to a total of 30 person-months of consultants, estimated at US$ 1.0 million. Co-financing funds (CFD and&#13;
KfW) will also be available.&#13;
5.15          Project's Relation to Drought Management. Although not financed under the Project as it&#13;
is not part of project description, drought management is an important feature in relation to this operation, and&#13;
it will have an impact on project performance by reducing risks for farmers and banks. GOT's commitment&#13;
on drought risk management is spelled out in para. 6.12.&#13;
D. Project Costs and Financing&#13;
5.16          Estimated Costs. The total project cost is estimated at US$420 million equivalent, including&#13;
US$223 million (or about 53%) in foreign exchange and US$62 million equivalent in related taxes arid duties.&#13;
Baseline estimates are expressed in March 1995 prices. The credit component is based on financial projections&#13;
that take into account past lending and BNA's development objectives and strategy as well as the priorities&#13;
outlined in the Eighth Development Plan. Physical contingencies are only calculated on storage and agro-&#13;
processing facilities but price contingencies have been calculated for the whole lending program."2 Cost&#13;

5.18          The proposed Bank loan of US$65 million would finance less than 16% of the project costs&#13;
and 30% of the foreign exchange requirements. The Government would guarantee repayment. It would also&#13;
assume the foreign exchange risk against a fee (para. 5.20) as for any other bank in Tunisia.&#13;
5.19          The Bank loan would be for 17 years, including five years of grace, at the standard variable&#13;
interest rate (plus commitment fee). Repayments of subloans not needed to service the Bank loan would be&#13;
recycled by BNA for additional agricultural and rural loans. Conclusion of the CFD and KfW loan agreements&#13;
would be required before June 30, 1996.&#13;
5.20          Treatment of Foreign Exchange Risk. The Republic of Tunisia would assume the foreign&#13;
exchange risk on the loan based on a cost sharing arrangement with BNA. As for the PICP loans, BNA would&#13;
cover exchange risk against a fee equal to "the MMR plus 0.5% and minus the Bank's standard variable interest&#13;
rate".&#13;

5.22          The goods to be financed by BNA credits to farmers, cooperatives and fishermen are not suitable&#13;
for bulk procurement because of their variety, the small size of individual investments and the wide dispersion&#13;
of contracts both in location and time (paras. 5.05 to 5.11). Since there are sufficient suppliers ensuring&#13;
competition, machinery and equipment would be bought by the subborrowers through established commercial&#13;
channels, acceptable to the Bank, from both local and foreign firms operating in Tunisia. Agroindustrial&#13;
investors will use, under BNA supervision, competitive procurement procedures from eligible private sources,&#13;
i.e , obtain quotations from eligible competing companies and make their choice based on quality, know-how,&#13;
price and after sale service. This procedure worked satisfactorily under previous projects; competition is keen&#13;
and prices competitive.&#13;
5.23          Consultants. Consultants and training specialists totalling 10 person-months (US$200,000)&#13;
would be appointed in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants of August 1981.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
5.24         Other Procedures. MIS software, computer maintenance, and goods for training programs&#13;
(US$300,000) would be procured through national shopping involving quotations from at least three suppliers,&#13;
in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement of January 1995. With a maximum value of a contract of&#13;
US$100,000, these procedures are appropriate for the specialized nature of the goods and services involved.&#13;
Review of the procurement made under the project will be carried out as part of the supervision by the Bank.&#13;
F. Disbursements&#13;
5.25         Disbursement Schedule. The proposed Bank Loan of US$65 million would be disbursed over&#13;
a period of five Bank fiscal years (1995-1999). Previous agricultural credit projects in Tunisia were also&#13;
disbursed in about four to five years. A schedule of estimated disbursements under the proposed Bank Loan&#13;
is summarized below and detailed in Table 23.&#13;

5.26         Disbursement Procedures. As the actual financing of subloans would be demand driven, the&#13;
allocation categories are only indicative for financial planning and cofinancing allocations. With this provision,&#13;
disbursement categories and the share of expenditures to be financed would be as shown in Table 10:&#13;

Total:                        65.0&#13;
5.27         Bank Approvals of BNA subloans. Subloans to agro-processing and fishery investors and to&#13;
agricultural development enterprises above US$1 Million equivalent (TDI Million) would require Bank approval&#13;
before financing.&#13;
5.28         The Revolving Fund. To facilitate the efficient and timely implementation of the project, the&#13;
Bank would authorize a maximum allocation of US$6.5 million (about four months' estimated disbursements&#13;
by BNA) to set up a revolving fund in accordance with Bank guidelines. After loan effectiveness and at BNA's&#13;
request, an initial deposit of up to US$6.5 million would be made in US$ dollars into a special account at BNA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
to finance eligible subloans and expenditures. BNA would normally request replenishment by the Bank when&#13;
33% or preferably 50% of the revolving fund has been disbursed to replenish the special account up to the&#13;
maximum authorized allocation of US$6.5 million. The minimum size of replenishment applications would be&#13;
US$500,000. Any ineligible payments made by BNA out of the special account must be reimbursed promptly&#13;
to the account, or if the Bank so requests, refunded to the Bank. Any amount outstanding in the special account&#13;
at loan closure not required to cover further payments for eligible subloans and expenditures would be refunded&#13;
to the Bank.&#13;
5.29         Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) and Retroactive Financing. All disbursements would be&#13;
against certified SOEs except for subloans above TDI Million (para. 5.27). The minimum size of withdrawal&#13;
applications would be US$200,000. Full Documentation for SOEs would be retained by BNA for review by&#13;
Bank supervision missions and would be reviewed and checked by the external auditors (para. 6.16). To ease&#13;
the prompt execution of the project, Retroactive financing up to US$6.5 million (10% of loan amount) is&#13;
recommended for payments made for eligible subloans approved by BNA after January 1, 1995 (signing date&#13;
is expected by end May 1995). Retroactive financing will help BNA by permitting some contracting for eligible&#13;
subloans during the FY95 agricultural season. The loan closing date is expected September 30, 1999.&#13;
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
6.01          BNA will be responsible for the implementation of the project, and the GOT will provide its&#13;
full support to BNA and be accountable for maintaining operational the drought risk coverage mechanism of&#13;
the Fonds National de Garantie--FNG; and for launching the study on informal rural finance and on group&#13;
lending. BNA is in the process of delegating an increasing amount of decision-making authority to the regions&#13;
and giving greater autonomy to the regional and branch offices. The goal is to make regional and local&#13;
managers more responsible for operational decisions. BNA will assume the full credit risk on subloans.&#13;
A. Credit Operations&#13;
6.02          Credit Risk Management. In response to its greater responsibility for managing risk in&#13;
agriculture, BNA has begun to develop credit risk management by implementing improved credit policies, client&#13;
selection, procedures, and supervision and collection capabilities. These continued efforts are part of BNA's&#13;
strategic statement (para.4.09) and action plan for 1994-1997 (Annex 3). These policies are acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Under the project, BNA will assume 100% of the credit risk on subloans. Climatic risk will be handled&#13;
separately (FNG).&#13;
Lending Procedures and Terms&#13;
6.03          Credit Guidelines. Purpose of BNA subloans, subloan size and terms, interest and spreads,&#13;
sub-borrower's contribution, appraisal and approval methods, delegation of loan approval, credit limits,&#13;
disbursement and supervision of subloans, and collateral and measures to increase loan collections are contained&#13;
in a BNA manual of procedures used by BNA's branch network staff. Details are in Annex 7.&#13;
6.04         Manual of Procedures. To address credit policy issues in response to changes in the Tunisian&#13;
financial system and market (chap. ITI), BNA needs to recast its manual of procedures to reflect evolving&#13;
conditions and BNA strategy. BNA action plan includes the distribution in 1995 to all credit officers, of revised&#13;
directives for loan approval and supervision, together with the prevailing BNA's terms and conditions. BNA&#13;
is reviewing, in consultation with the Bank the upgrading of existing procedures as well as the writing of new&#13;
procedures. The manual will regroup all operating guidelines specifying lending terms and conditions, including&#13;
subloan size, subborrower contribution, collateral requirements, repayment terms, current interest rates to be&#13;
applied, and procedures to appraise, approve, disburse, supervise and recover subloans. This manual will have&#13;
to evolve as the reforms proposed under the project take place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
6.05          Subborrowers Eligibility. Only subprojects in agriculture, agriculture-cum-processing, rural&#13;
and cooperative enterprises, fisheries wherein the potential for increased production or increased efficiency in&#13;
related marketing and processing are clearly established will be eligible for project financing. Rural housing,&#13;
artisans and rural women's enterprises are also eligible. Subloan appraisal and approval would be the&#13;
responsibility of BNA. Where useful and practicable, BNA would also rely on the advice and existing expertise&#13;
of the Ministry of Agriculture staff to firm up the appraisal of the technical aspects of investments proposed by&#13;
farmers. The initiative for these periodic consultations between BNA and MOA would come either from BNA&#13;
headquarters and field staff, or from the MOA.&#13;
B. Women's Participation and Environmental Aspects&#13;
6.06          Women's Participation in Credit Activities. The banking system in Tunisia lends to women&#13;
without prejudice provided it can recover its money, and employs women on an equal footing with men.&#13;
Traditional family attitudes in rural areas, however, are still a strong limiting factor for women's access to&#13;
credit. Under the project, action to promote rural savings tied to credit eligibility is an area where efforts would&#13;
be made to help the very few existing women farm holders. Women seem to be most active in livestock and&#13;
vegetable activities and off-farm activities where they can take some lead in the family. The line of credit will&#13;
be open to both men and women in all categories of eligible activities. The study on informal group lending will&#13;
include measures to develop credit/savings pilot actions for women.&#13;
6.07          Environmental Aspects.  Regulations for environmental protection exist in Tunisia and are&#13;
well-supported by GOT in the area of water and soil conservation. For agro-industries to be financed under the&#13;
Project, there are no special environment concerns given (a) the nature of the products to be processed (mainly&#13;
fruits and vegetables where use of agro-chemicals is not significant), and (b) the minimum amount of water to&#13;
be used in the processing so that there is no water pollution problem. Subloan proposals, however, will include&#13;
an environmental analysis satisfactory to BNA in accordance with the requirements of the National Agency for&#13;
the Protection of the Environment (ANPE) as needed. The scope and detail of this analysis would be appropriate&#13;
to the size and nature of the investment proposed. For livestock, there are no major environment concerns&#13;
either, since animal health services are being improved by encouraging veterinarians to enter private practice.&#13;
With regard to herbicides only 20% of farmers apply weed-killers; most smallholders have their fields hand&#13;
weeded using family labor as weeds have value as animal feed. Pesticide imports, transport, storage and use&#13;
are well-controlled and pose no problem. On fisheries, subloans will not encourage the expansion of new&#13;
activities, but the consolidation of the existing ones so as not to increase excessively the fishing efforts in the&#13;
Gulf of Gabes which has limited resources. The state of exploitation of the Gulf will be monitored by BNA&#13;
in cooperation with the Tunisian Fisheries Research Institute.&#13;
C. Institutional Development&#13;
6.08          BNA Institutional Strengthening and Financial Performance. The following set of actions&#13;
and measures have been taken and others would be taken under the Project to make it possible for BNA to&#13;
become a financially sounder and stronger institution.&#13;
(al   Implementation of Strategic Plan. To enhance its performance, BNA will have to carry out&#13;
improvements in several aspects of its evolving policies and operations. Because of the&#13;
multiplicity of actions, BNA needs to formulate, by December 31, 1995, a strong multilevel&#13;
strategic planning process (sche'ma directeur strat6gique), with a view to improving strategic&#13;
and tactical plans, and translating more efficiently goals, strategies and tasks into financial and&#13;
operating targets (systeme de pilotage de management). This will make it possible for BNA,&#13;
by December 31, 1996, to better implement changes within its vision of the future of the bank&#13;
in a gradually open market (Annex 3 pages 49,53,54).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
(b)    Decentralization of Operations. BNA's operations are still too centralized. Most regional&#13;
directorates and local branches must refer to headquarters for a large number of operational&#13;
decisions such as small overdraft of commercial credits or agreements with clients on payment&#13;
of past due loan amounts. BNA has started to delegate an increasing amount of decision&#13;
making authority to the regions; because of the cost involved and the staff qualifications&#13;
required to succeed in this effort, it is proceeding with great care. Without immediately&#13;
increasing the number of decentralized regional offices, BNA will give greater autonomy to the&#13;
regional and to the local branch offices in order to responsibilize their managers, speed up&#13;
decision making in the field, and improve the quality of service to customers. Accordingly, a&#13;
decentralized cost accounting system to determine results per sector and regional/local branch&#13;
has been initiated and would be made operational as of June 30, 1996. Within that context,&#13;
headquarters will increasingly play a role of a posteriori control.&#13;
(c)    Financial Performance.  BNA has provided with its  adopted action plan for 1995-97, a&#13;
financial performance development letter, satisfactory to the Bank, with monitorable indicators&#13;
aiming at maintaining minimum standards of financial performance. On the basis of these&#13;
indicators and those summarized in Table 5, BNA is expected to achieve the following financial&#13;
results: (i) BNA's capital adequacy as measured by the ratio of equity to risk-weighted assets&#13;
increased to 3,7% end December 1994, and is expected to reach 5% by June 30, 1996 (Central&#13;
Bank requirement). BNA's objective is to reach a higher level of capital adequacy in 1997 and&#13;
1998. Current projections show that BNA could reach the 8% international standard by Project&#13;
completion; (ii) BNA's liquidity as measured by the ratio of loans to deposits would be reduced&#13;
from above 2.0 in 1994 to a more acceptable international standard of about 1.8 in 1998;&#13;
(iii) BNA's would maintain, annually, a pre-tax return on equity of 10% in average; (iv) BNA's&#13;
gross financial margin (excess of interests received over interest paid as a percentage of interest&#13;
received) is expected to increase from 25.2 in 1994 to 39.4 in 1998 which would be good.&#13;
Recoveries on credit operations from 1995 onwards are expected to be not less than 90% on&#13;
average. BNA would also: (v) monitor onlending interest rates and spreads on an annual basis&#13;
so that they cover average financial cost, operating cost, and credit risk; and (vi) verify that its&#13;
net financial intermediation margin'3 remains at no less than 2%.&#13;
(d)    Definition of Decision Making Authority.  The functions of the main units (central&#13;
directorates, directorates and divisions) are clearly defined in BNA's organization manual. The&#13;
decision making authority of the managers at various sub-levels in the organization still needs&#13;
to be clearly defined, and BNA has decided to remedy this weakness by end 1995.&#13;
(e)    Derinition of Functions. Because of its activities as a multi-purpose bank, BNA's staff works&#13;
in a wide variety of operational activities such as financial and economic analysis of investment&#13;
projects, accounting, commercial banking operations, data processing, personnel management,&#13;
control and other functions. In 1994, neither the specific tasks nor the qualifications required&#13;
from those fulfilling these various functions were defined in writing. The result is a lack of&#13;
objective criteria to evaluate staff performance and difficulty determining staff training needs&#13;
clearly. BNA will define in writing the tasks and qualifications required for each of the&#13;
functions performed by the staff by end 1996 (project analyst, accountant, personnel officer,&#13;
credit officer and others).&#13;
(f)   Improvement of the Data Processing System. The data processing system currently used by&#13;
BNA does not correspond to its needs. It does not provide managers at different levels with&#13;
the timely information required to make decisions, nor with statistics regarding some key&#13;
elements of BNA's activities. Furthermore, many operational activities are still carried out&#13;
13     Interest income as a percentage of average portfolio outstanding minus interest expenses as a percentage of&#13;
average borrowing outstanding and deposits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
manually, which mobilize a considerable amount of BNA's human resources, while urgent&#13;
needs, such as loan collections and contact with customers, do not receive all the attention that&#13;
they deserve.  BNA will devote all the resources in staff and materials needed to start&#13;
developing, as of December 1995, a modern and efficient data management system.&#13;
6.09          Project-Related Training. BNA would be responsible for project-related training, and would&#13;
use its own facilities, those of the training institute of APB and/or any other good facilities needed to hold&#13;
seminars in Tunis or in other cities of the country. The objective is to train around 40% of about 3,000 BNA&#13;
staff each year. BNA will continue using members of its staff to provide in-house training. However, to ease&#13;
the task of the staff doing the training and optimize its effectiveness, BNA will create the position of "trainer".&#13;
Furthermore, to stimulate the interest of qualified staff in doing this type of work, the function will be given&#13;
high visibility, will be motivating and will part of a career development plan. BNA would prepare, by&#13;
November 30 of each year, an annual training program.&#13;
6.10          Loan Collection Measures. (a) Agriculture: as part of its strategy to improve loan collection,&#13;
BNA's management has established in 1993, a special unit (in DCRA--see Chart) to develop and implement a&#13;
recovery program. Its task is to reduce/clean, by the end of 1996, accumulated arrears (TD 213 million as of&#13;
end 1992 plus TD 20 million under legal process) through collections, rescheduling, legal process and write-&#13;
offs. BNA has carried out an analysis of its classified, subquality loans classifying individual amounts due by&#13;
age, by crop, by region and BNA's branch. Based on this analysis, BNA has initiated an action program&#13;
focusing, firt. on 7000 clients with debts over TD 10,000 who represent 60% of the portfolio affected by&#13;
arrears. The non-performing portfolio of the ex-BNDA, with 100 clients represents half of these arrears (i.e.,&#13;
30% of total arrears), and amounts that fell due in 1993 and 1994 as well as amounts falling due beyond 1994&#13;
add to existing arrears, and some write-offs will be needed. Second individual debts below TD 10,000--&#13;
representing 40% of the portfolio affected by arrears--are distributed over 153,000 clients. This latter category&#13;
of clients, mainly funded under budgetary resources at GOT's risk, will be tackled in cooperation with MOA's&#13;
regional offices, the CRDAs; (b) Industry and Commerce: a similar recovery plan, managed by a special unit&#13;
(DRCE--see Chart) has started in 1994 for the industrial and commercial arrears (TD 164 million of which&#13;
TD 39 million are in arrear and TD 125 million under legal process as of December 31, 1992). The number&#13;
of clients with arrears is 2,960 of which 445 represent 60% of the portfolio affected by arrears. Action is&#13;
targeted to this small group of clients. Since 1992, BNA complies with BCT new prudential regulations on risk&#13;
assets classification (five asset classes according to portfolio performance--see para. 3.09).&#13;
6.11          The overall supervision process of the action program on recovery of arrears and on collection&#13;
policy has been entrusted to the Deputy CEO (DGA--see Chart). Improved recovery rates are essential for the&#13;
bank's viability and it is a top priority of BNA's management strategy not only to modify procedures in the&#13;
short run but to fundamentally change BNA's culture and attitude towards lending. Staff, throughout BNA's&#13;
branch network, have been sensitized to this critical issue and asked to devote time and effort to collections.&#13;
Improved collection is linked to a better selection of viable clients and more regular visits to clients. BNA's&#13;
management is closely monitoring the present recovery plan which is part of its action plan 1994-1997&#13;
(Annex 3). Assumptions on recovery rates used in financial projections are in Table 16 (Part 1).&#13;
6.12          Drought Risk Management Scheme: The GOT would ensure that the Fonds National de&#13;
Garantie (FNG), now operational for covering the risk of default in interest payments from creditworthy farmers&#13;
afflicted by drought is suitably maintained, including in particular: (i) the application of a sustainable level of&#13;
drought insurance premium rates; (ii) the maintenance of well-defined management and financial procedures;&#13;
(iii) the possibility to all banks that their clients who are farmers be covered against drought risk; (iv) a&#13;
determination of drought-related losses through independent assessments of the degree of climatic damage in&#13;
areas directly affected by drought; and (v) the availability of technical expertise in agricultural insurance. The&#13;
MOA is responsible for coordinating the selection of drought-stricken areas using the necessary expertise to&#13;
assess the severity of the drought and potential losses by farmers. BNA would conduct the analysis of its&#13;
delinquent credit accounts on a case by case basis through its branch network. Details on the FNG are in&#13;
working file No. 25.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
D. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
6.13          Monitoring is and would remain an integral part of day-to-day operational management of&#13;
BNA's activities at Headquarters and branch levels. Under the Loan, BNA's monitoring and evaluation unit at&#13;
Headquarters will: (i) collect and consolidate the data on commitments/disbursements under subloans, physical&#13;
achievements under selected components/subprojects, and results of representative investment operations,&#13;
(ii) monitor and evaluate BNA's results under its Action Plan, training programs and financial performance&#13;
indicators including recovery performance, and (iii) monitor progress under the proposed pilot program on&#13;
drought management (FNG) and informal group lending.&#13;
E. Supervision, Mid-Term Review and Reporting&#13;
6.14          Bank strategy for the supervision of project implementation and performance is spelled out in&#13;
Annex 5. As part of this strategy, the Government, BNA, and the Bank will carry out a joint Mid-Term&#13;
Review of the project not later than April 30, 1997. The review will be a critical event in the implementation&#13;
of the Project and its purpose and contents has been agreed upon during negotiations of the Loan. Its objectives&#13;
are to: (i) monitor progress on implementation performance of agreed objectives, financial indicators, measures&#13;
to clean past arrears, and compliance with legal covenants; (ii) examine the FNG operations in implementing&#13;
the drought risk management mechanism, and progress made on developing pilot group lending; (iii) evaluate&#13;
BNA's uses and sources of funding; (iv) assess BNA's strategy and the likely development impact and&#13;
sustainability of the project at mid-term of its implementation; and (v) update as necessary BNA's action plan&#13;
and the project's implementation program until completion.&#13;
6.15          Reporting. BNA will provide to the Bank the following semi-annual progress reports within&#13;
three months of the end of each semester; these will include commitments, disbursements, subloan maturities&#13;
and actual collections by category of beneficiaries, changes in lending policies and procedures, BNA's financial&#13;
results and revised financial projections, progress being achieved in the implementation of the BNA's Action&#13;
Plan and the drought insurance scheme. BNA will also provide summary statements on recoveries for all&#13;
BNA's agricultural credit operations using an improved methodology to report on loan collections. The end of&#13;
each calendar year evaluation report will include a detailed cost accounting of BNA's agricultural/rural&#13;
operations, and of other operations and branch offices.  In addition, BNA will prepare its part of an&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) and its updated action plan for 2000-2002, to be submitted to the Bank&#13;
within six months after the closing date of the loan.&#13;
F. Accounts and Audit&#13;
6.16          BNA has a reliable basic accounting system involving (a) a centralized accounting system; (b) an&#13;
internal audit unit; (c) a stable work force in terms of key financial staff; (d) defined procedures; and&#13;
(e) timeliness in producing annual financial statements of satisfactory quality. During project implementation,&#13;
BNA will further modernize its system by developing decentralized MIS applications, in particular for detailed&#13;
cost accounting purposes at branch level. BNA accounts and financial statements have been since 1992 and&#13;
would continue under the Project to be audited annually by independent auditors of international caliber"4 who&#13;
are acceptable to the Bank. BNA will send to the Bank, within six months of the close of each fiscal year, a&#13;
full audit report which will incorporate, in one document with the auditors' opinions, a long form report on&#13;
BNA's overall-financial statements including project accounts, and on procedures including compliance with&#13;
BCT prudential regulations, with three specific auditors' opinions on (i) project accounts, (ii) statements of&#13;
expenditures (SOEs), and (iii) the revolving fund (Special Account). In addition, the auditors will certify, each&#13;
fiscal year and as of June 30, 1996, the ratio of capital adequacy reached by BNA, and will verify if BNA's&#13;
declared financial objectives are reached (BNA's financial performance development letter sent to the Bank with&#13;
the approved Action Plan). BNA will send audit reports to the Bank and report contents will be discussed with&#13;
BNA and the auditors during Bank supervision missions.&#13;

VII. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits and Justification&#13;
7.01          Benefits. The ultimate beneficiaries would be a wide range of private investors and in particular&#13;
the small and medium-scale farmers who could benefit from an improved rural financial system and drought&#13;
risk coverage mechanism. BNA, a critical bank in Tunisia not just because of its size but because of its&#13;
involvement in the strategic sector, would be strengthened at a crucial stage in its institutional development.&#13;
In addition, measures complementary to the project are already helping GOT reorient its rural credit policy&#13;
which, over time, would make rural financial intermediation more attractive, hence more competitive. This&#13;
reoriented approach separates credit from income transfer and addresses each of the three major sources of risk&#13;
in financial intermediation separately, namely credit, moral and climatic. Instead of having to deal with the&#13;
three types of risks, BNA will focus on credit risk. By separating GOT and BNA accounts, the GOT has taken&#13;
a first step in lending the confusion between credit and income transfer, a confusion for lender and borrower&#13;
alike, which has undermined credit discipline. With the focus on credit risk, BNA would place its agricultural&#13;
and rural activities on a sounder financial and operational footing and benefit from lasting improvements in&#13;
recovery. An increased number of creditworthy smallholders should benefit from BNA's strengthened rural&#13;
outreach. 'To address climatic risk, the project is supporting the GOT's decision to use the FNG to help both&#13;
farmers and credit institutions to better manage the effects of drought. The objective here is to provide a more&#13;
efficient alternative to past GOT direct interventions which contributed to poor credit discipline. The GOT also&#13;
intends to further promote private agricultural insurance. Over time, rural financial intermediation will expand&#13;
and become more competitive as a clear demarcation is maintained between credit and income transfer, as&#13;
interest rates become more attractive, and the risk of drought is better managed.&#13;
7.02          Financial Impact on the Beneficiaries. The projected impact of the Project on Farmer's and&#13;
investors income would be substantial at full development. Under the best of conditions, financial rates of&#13;
returns (FRRs) vary from 20% to 32% for the twelve investment models analyzed; eight farm models, one agro-&#13;
industry, one large agricultural enterprise and two fishing investments. These FRRs are, however, very&#13;
sensitive to decreasing benefits or increasing costs. Annex 9 describes: in part (A), BNA's Supervised Credit&#13;
Program for Small Farmers; and, in part (B), the Project Impact on the Beneficiaries.&#13;
7.03          Economic Analysis of Selected Sub-Projects. Similarly, an economic rate of return (ERR)&#13;
has also been calculated for each investment model. In most models the ERRs exceed the FRRs, mainly,&#13;
because of the shadow pricing of labor and, to a lesser extent, because of taxation on some inputs. The results&#13;
have not been aggregated into an overall ERR for the project as a whole, because the distribution of loans&#13;
among these types of investment or among variations of the models will depend on changing relative prices,&#13;
attractiveness of alternative investments, land use, and market forces (Annex 9).&#13;
7.04          Justification. The strengthening, financially and operationally, of BNA, the only bank for&#13;
smallholder agriculture, is an important step in GOT's agricultural credit reform program. The Bank's support&#13;
for agricultural credit in Tunisia is justified at a crucial stage in BNA's institutional development and at a time&#13;
when the BNA is expected to play an increasing role in promoting private investment in rural areas, and&#13;
agricultural growth. This, in turn, would impact favorably on Tunisia's economic and social goals. Satisfactory&#13;
results on this reform program, would set the stage for further privatization of BNA in the future&#13;
(e.g., withdraw of ONH and OC from capital ownership).&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
7.05          Risks Outside the Control of BNA. The major risks outside the control of BNA are twofold:&#13;
(i) weather-related and (ii) reform-related. To address weather-related calamities, the project is supporting the&#13;
GOT's decision to make the FNG operational for drought management. This scheme should provide a more&#13;
efficient alternative to GOT's political decision to write off repayment on loans after droughts. New droughts,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
GOT's decision to make the FNG operational for drought management. This scheme should provide a more&#13;
efficient alternative to GOT's political decision to write off repayment on loans after droughts. New droughts,&#13;
however, (as in 1993-1994) could undermine BNA's recovery performance although the drought risk scheme&#13;
is fully operational. The project is taking measures to help BNA in recovery and in buffering the negative&#13;
financial impact. The GOT realizes that it is essential to develop a sustainable rural credit system, one of its&#13;
important development objectives.&#13;
7.06         Risks Within the Control of BNA. BNA is addressing the problem of poor repayment&#13;
discipline by restructuring its rural operations in the following ways: (i) improving the creditworthiness of low&#13;
income borrowers by grouping them; (ii) tightening eligibility criteria on creditworthiness; (iii) linking savings&#13;
and past repayment record to new loans; and (iv) strengthening rural outreach.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
TUNISIA&#13;
NATIONAL RURAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
Structure of Farm Holdings and Categories of Agricultural Credit Borrowers&#13;
1.     Agricultural production in Tunisia is carried out under several types of tenancy and farm size&#13;
arrangements. Broadly speaking, there are three categories of farmers, small, medium, and large. The&#13;
first category can be further divided into subsistence and viable small farmers. There has been a long&#13;
and lively debate in Tunisia regarding the definition of these farmers, their role in production, where&#13;
they are located, and how to deal with these various categories from economic, political, and social&#13;
points of view.&#13;
2.      The structure of agricultural holdings.   MOA has been concerned with production and&#13;
productivity increases as well as with reducing poverty in agriculture. It has intervened very actively in&#13;
agriculture to promote technological changes. In this pursuit it has, for operational reasons, established&#13;
a definition of farmers based principally on size. Farm size is an important indicator to determine farm&#13;
structure and to develop a strategy for production purposes; it is not sufficiently precise, however, to&#13;
determine farmers' eligibility for bank credit or their ability to repay a loan. The census data (see table&#13;
below) shows farm units by size but do not distinguish between non-cultivating owners and operators;&#13;
as a result that they do not highlight tenancy as a widespread production arrangement, particularly among&#13;
small farmers, and they thereby overstate the number of farms in the same category.&#13;

3.      86% of the farm holdings have less than 20 ha; these cover about 41 % of agricultural land.&#13;
Most of these holdings are operated by subsistence farmers who have difficulty sustaining a family. The&#13;
larger fatms above 50 ha represent only 4% of the farmers but operate about 34% of the land. In&#13;
between these two categories are the small- and medium-size farms, between 20 and 50 ha, of which a&#13;
larger group is viable depending on the agro-climatic zone in which they are located. The important&#13;
agro-climatic variations with rainfall, decreasing from north to south, make it possible that some farms&#13;
below 20 ha in the north are viable, while an 80 ha rainfed farm in the south may not be able to sustain&#13;
a family; similarly, where irrigation water is available, a two ha vegetable plot may be a viable unit, or&#13;
a 7 Tha rainfed plot in a marginal zone with one irrigated ha may also be a viable unit. These large agro-&#13;
climatic variations make it difficult to clearly differentiate bankable or creditworthy farmers from&#13;
subsistence ones on farm size alone.&#13;
4.      The 1984 population census,' updated in 1989, indicates that 120,000 heads of households&#13;
consider farm activity as their principal source of income; this represents 30% of the country's total farm&#13;
units. Another 40% have declared themselves as part time farmers and off-farm activity to be their&#13;
principal source of income. The remaining 30% have declared a part time and limited activity in&#13;
agriculture together with other activities but without specifying the principal source of income.&#13;
5.      Minimum viable farm size. The Tunisians, within the framework of IFAD loans, and a Bank&#13;
loan (Ln. 2865-TUN) have made attempts to clarify and define viable small farmers to determine their&#13;
creditworthiness and eligibility to banking credit. The Centre National des Etudes Agricoles (CNEA)&#13;
conducted farm surveys in four governorates (le Kef, Siliana, Kairouan, and Sfax) in 1982 and 1987 and&#13;
MOA, with the assistance of a consulting firm (SCET-Tunisie), carried out a minimum viable farm size&#13;
study in 1987.2 The surveys and study were based on farm size in both rainfed and irrigated agriculture,&#13;
potential of farm development, availability and access to inputs, and income prior to and after&#13;
development. The analysis indicated that farms which could generate income at about TD 3,500 annually&#13;
can afford to borrow at market interest rates; such income could be reached on farms with 20 ha in the&#13;
agro-climatic zone with rainfall above 600 mm, or in zones with lesser rainfall when rainfed farming is&#13;
combined with irrigation. However, for farmers with incomes between TD 1200 and 3,500, it was&#13;
concluded that these could be potentially viable but are high risk for the lending agency.&#13;
6.      On the basis of the above census figures and the indications from the surveys and study, it is&#13;
estimated that the small farmers (subsistence and potentially viable) not eligible to bank credit amount to&#13;
about 267,000 and the viable or bankable farmers about 120,000 - 130,000. Obviously, considering the&#13;
ambiguities of the census data, these figures should be considered as an order of magnitude which&#13;
indicates that the proportion of bankable to subsistence farmer is about one to three. BNA considers that&#13;
its potential market is about 100,000 farmers, figure to be reduced, after screening to about 30,000&#13;
bankable farmers.&#13;
7.      The Agricultural Credit System within the Farming Structure. Different sources of funds&#13;
and different channels have shaped the agricultural credit system over the last 30 years to address these&#13;
broadly categorized types of farm units. GOT has been mostly concerned with assisting the small, and&#13;
particularly the subsistence farmers, through different credit lines (special funds). BNA is attempting to&#13;
reach all bankable types of farmers and has interpreted the income guideline as the cutoff point of credit&#13;

eligibility, flexibly based on individual appraisal (it is worthwhile noting that its list of agricultural clients&#13;
at the end of 1991 numbered 109,680).&#13;
8.      With regard to the other banks, they deal principally with short-term credit and focus on larger&#13;
farmers (above 50 ha in the North) and on agro-industrial and development enterprises which have good&#13;
collateral, for loans where fully liberalized interest rates apply.  Reasons for the other banks'&#13;
concentration in this latter category is that, besides financial consideration, these farmers or units are a&#13;
better risk and are accessible without a large branch network. One of the principal obstacles to a broader&#13;
participation of the banking system in lending to all categories of farmers has been the need to develop&#13;
a costly outreach capacity, combined with the need for an effective insurance scheme to separate the&#13;
normal credit risk from the climatic risk. BNA's share of the total credit channeled through the&#13;
commercial banks for 1991-1992 is 30%, and BNA financed 75% of all agricultural credit, and this&#13;
includes short-term credit for cereal marketing and export prefinancing.&#13;
Strengths and weaknesses of the agricultural credit system&#13;
9.      Substantial progress has been made on the agricultural credit policy level by closing the gap&#13;
between the regulated or preferential interest rate and the money market rate. Since November 1993,&#13;
all agricultural interest rates applied by BNA are above the money market rate. In June 1994 interest rate&#13;
ceilings have been removed except a few rates for priority activities. These changes are important&#13;
because they now allow BNA to obtain a surplus on its agriculture operations for the first time since its&#13;
initial creation in 1959 and because they contribute to a better environment to induce other banks to&#13;
become more active in agriculture.&#13;
10.    This change in interest rate policy is part of GOT's broader commitment to reduce its&#13;
involvement in direct credit distribution. The special funds aimed at the smaller farmers which amounted&#13;
to 48 lines of credit have been reduced to four. Those funds that have been retained are part of integrated&#13;
action programs aimed at poverty reduction. The small farmers under the previous credit lines which&#13;
have a satisfactory recovery rate will, from now on, be eligible for BNA credit at BNA risk. At the same&#13;
time BNA is developing, in cooperation with MOA, supervised credit schemes whose main focus and&#13;
objective is to grant credit to these potentially creditworthy small farmers. These are located principally&#13;
in the North and in areas where irrigation is available. MOA's extension services assist BNA staff to&#13;
appraise the technical aspect of farmers investment, under BNA responsibility. The credit risk analysis&#13;
and decision is BNA's responsibility. Extension services may provide technical advice to the farmers&#13;
during supervision.&#13;
11.    Since 1959, the authorities have largely approached the problem of building a credit delivery&#13;
system from the top down. BNA was established and emerged as the principal bank to distribute credit&#13;
under GOT's guidance, and developed a branch network to reach farmers on an individual basis, but little&#13;
attention has been given to developing an approach from the grassroots or from the bottom up&#13;
encouraging farmers to organize or participate in the system. There is presently no efficient farm&#13;
organization at the primary or village level able to deal independently as a group with the banking&#13;
system. Such a development will take time but initiatives in the form of studies and surveys on how to&#13;
organize group lending schemes will be developed under the proposed project.&#13;
12.    Substantial changes and fundamental reforms have taken place in the approach to agricultural&#13;
credit in the last few years. This project should assist in deepening the institutional reform process to&#13;
develop a financially sound rural finance system well integrated into a more competitive financial sector.&#13;

I. Staffing&#13;
Total staff evolution&#13;
1.     While on December 31, 1987, BNA's total staff numbered 2,136, seven years later, at the end&#13;
of 1994, it totalled 2,981 persons, an increase of about 40%. During that period, the staff increased at&#13;
an annual average rate of 4.7%.&#13;
2.      The annual increase of BNA's staff is presented in the table below:&#13;

3.      The staff increases that took place in 1989 and 1990 were partly related to the merger of BNT&#13;
and BNDA into BNA. In recent years, particularly in 1991 and 1992, the staff increased at a higher rate&#13;
than experienced during the period overall.&#13;

5.      Between 1987 and 1994 the proportion of staff in management positions has increased from 6&#13;
to 9%, while the proportion of professionals has risen significantly from 18 to 31%. During the same&#13;
period the proportion of support staff has declined from 76 to 60% of total staff. BNA has recently put&#13;
emphasis on developing its technical capabilities in the various areas of the banking sector in which it&#13;
operates.&#13;
Staff at Headquarters and the Field Ofrices&#13;
6.      As of October 31, 1994, 1,315 staff members (44% of the total) were working at headquarters&#13;
while 1,666 (56%) were operating in the field office (regional offices and branch offices). The changes&#13;
that have taken place between 1987 and 1994 in terms of staffing location are presented in Table 3:&#13;

7.     In 1987, there was an almost equal number of staff at headquarters and in the field offices.&#13;
Every year thereafter, the proportion of field staff has been increasing, and, at the end of 1994, it was&#13;
44 : 56. This reflects BNA's policy to decentralize its operations and to have an increasing number of&#13;
its staff working in the regional offices.&#13;

8.      At the end of October 1994, BNA's staff included 2,236 men (about 75% of the total) and 745&#13;
women (25 % of the total). A breakdown of the staff between men and women and by occupational level&#13;
at different dates is presented below.&#13;

9.      Between 1987 and 1994, the proportion of women in BNA's staff has increased by 4 percentage&#13;
points. While the number of women in management positions rose by 4 percentage points, the number&#13;
of women in the professional category increased 2.5 times. This indicates that BNA is favoring the&#13;
recruitment of professional women, which is giving a more balanced sex distribution.&#13;
Staff specializations&#13;
10.    Because of the nature of its operations as a universal bank, BNA employs specialists in various&#13;
areas, such as financial analysts (198), economists (187), agronomists (22), and personnel specialists (7).&#13;
In terms of level of education, 764 staff members have bachelor's degrees, and 504 have a master's&#13;
degree or a doctorate.&#13;

12.    BNA's training activities have fluctuated widely and, until recently, although some attempt was&#13;
made to develop training activities on a systematic basis by the preparation of a five-year training plan,&#13;
BNA has not actually given the training function the significance that it deserves.&#13;
13.    Fortunately, this situation is in the process of changing as BNA's new management has clearly&#13;
indicated that it gives a high priority to staff training. Much needs to be done to compensate for past&#13;
deficiencies. In particular, the following actions are being taken:&#13;
(a)   BNA is defining the function of "trainer" with adequate incentives as an integral part of&#13;
a career development plan to induce competent staff members to be interested in these&#13;
activities. BNA would need to identify some individuals who might have such interest&#13;
and the necessary qualifications to receive training as trainers.&#13;
(b)   BNA has prepared a five-year training program, taking into consideration BNA's most&#13;
urgent needs, and also expected needs deriving from its new activities. In that respect,&#13;
it would be worthwhile for all managers, at headquarters and in the field offices, to&#13;
attend seminars to expose them to the most modern management methods and for the&#13;
directors of regional offices and branch offices to be brought up to date on the&#13;
developments that have taken place in the banking and financial sectors. As a second&#13;
step or in parallel if possible, it would be worthwhile to organize seminars for the staff&#13;
involved in project work to improve their performance in the preparation, appraisal and&#13;
supervision of agricultural and industrial investments.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
The various centers of responsibility within the bank have conducted a strategic analysis&#13;
of their activities in accordance with the broad objectives defined by the General Management&#13;
as a result of the central strategic analysis that produced the "5 Year Strategic Plan" initiated&#13;
in April, 1994.&#13;
The "Action Plan 1994-1997" forms the connection between the Strategic Plan and the&#13;
detailed action plans developed by the individual departments of the bank, with the " 5 Year&#13;
Financial Projections" forrning a key component.&#13;
*     This document, which was developed by the Analysis and Management Control&#13;
Department, provides a road map intended to facilitate oversight by the General Management.&#13;
It summarizes by major areas - Financial Restructuring, Financial Performance and Institutional&#13;
Issues - the main objectives to be achieved, the actions to be taken as well as the results&#13;
expected. The entire management team of the Bank has been involved in its preparation.&#13;
3     The "Action Plan 1994-1997" was conceived as a tool to guide the transition from&#13;
general principles on the strategic direction of the bank to the development of specific objectives&#13;
and actions to be taken. Initially developed in September 1994, it will be updated periodically'&#13;
with respect to:&#13;
oversight of implementation&#13;
- adapting to major internal or external events that could have a significant impact on the&#13;
present or future financial condition of the bank, including the Restructuring Plan for the OC&#13;
and for the Groupe Chimique.&#13;

which it is based are shown in the Comments column.&#13;
The original Action Plan is in French - every effort has been made to translate the meaning into&#13;
accurate English. The original French text is available on request.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
TUNISIA&#13;
NATIONAL RURAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
Informal Rural Finance and Group Lending Schemes: Terms of Reference&#13;
1. Background&#13;
1.     GOT has, since the early sixties, been directly involved in agricultural credit; it considered&#13;
agricultural credit as an important tool to assist all farm households, large and small. This latter&#13;
category, including subsistence and non-creditworthy small farms, represents about two-thirds of all farm&#13;
households. The financial effort has been substantial, it involved subsidized interest rates to agriculture&#13;
and linked credit programs with grants to all categories of farmers, including those who were not&#13;
creditworthy. In times of adverse climatic conditions and/or unfavorable conjunctural circumstances, it&#13;
intervened through the postponement or rescheduling of interest and principal repayments.&#13;
2.     On the institutional side, to allocate and deliver credit, it created a national agricultural credit&#13;
bank in 1959, which was transformed into a more universal bank in 1969, the BNT, and then merged&#13;
with BNDA in 1989 to become BNA again. BNT developed a country-wide branch network to make&#13;
credit accessible, particularly to medium and small farms. It conducted credit operations on its own&#13;
resources and risk, but also administered direct GOT credit lines (at GOT risk) aimed principally at small&#13;
farmers. GOT also attempted to promote and develop farmers' associations at the village level, which&#13;
would handle the credit for their members: the members, in turn, would assume mutual responsibility&#13;
for repayment of the loans. In 1963 these took the form of "Caisses Locales de Credit Mutuel" and in&#13;
1973, of "Societes de Caution Mutuelle Agricole." Both of these organizations played a minor role in&#13;
lending to small farmers; these were saddled with arrears which GOT had to assume. GOT in its&#13;
concern to reach small farmers maintained an interventionist policy in agricultural operations but, over&#13;
time, allowed market rates in lending to large farmers.&#13;
3.     In the early nineties GOT undertook far-reaching reforms in agricultural credit. Among the most&#13;
important, taken in 1993, are the divesting of GOT from credit operations and the deregulation of&#13;
interestlrates. Interest rates are now based on the money market rate (MMR). GOT has, since June 1994&#13;
liberalized most interest rates. These fundamental changes have contributed to opening the market and&#13;
allow the banking system to operate in a more financially autonomous and competitive manner.&#13;
4.     While these reforms open up the finance market, it does not necessarily mean that all small farm&#13;
holdings will have access to credit or that all banks will be lending to the agricultural sector. Tunisia,&#13;
like most developing countries, has an imperfect rural credit market which stems from the characteristics&#13;
of agricultural production and from the farm holding size, location, and type of land tenure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -                                    Annex 4&#13;
5.      Agricultural income is influenced markedly by climatic conditions which expose banks and the&#13;
farm population to higher risk than those prevailing in other sectors. Rainfall in Tunisia ranges from&#13;
1200 mm annually in the North to less than 200 mm in the South and the monthly average rain&#13;
distribution may vary substantially from year to year. In most of the territory, agricultural production&#13;
is only feasible with the help of irrigation. These conditions cause variability in farmers' income and the&#13;
related repayment capacity and, among the farmers, the small-size units are the most vulnerable.&#13;
6.      Besides the climatic risk, lending to small-size farmers often implies servicing a geographically&#13;
dispersed clientele, which may entail high transaction costs. Most of these loans are small and to&#13;
farmers who frequently lack clear land titles leading to the absence of collateral for investments.&#13;
7.      With the recent abolition of the administrative allocation of funds for agricultural credit and an&#13;
interest rate based on market rates, bank lending in rural areas is expected to expand in the future. The&#13;
development of an effective insurance scheme against climatic risks will, when it becomes operational,&#13;
also contribute to overcome bankers' hesitancy to lend, particularly, to small farmers. Nevertheless a&#13;
large number of potentially creditworthy small farmers, craftsmen, and laborers who operate a small&#13;
agricultural plot may still have difficulty getting access to formal or institutional credit. Until recently&#13;
they received credit from time to time through the government-subsidized credit lines and there was little&#13;
need to go to a bank for credit or little incentive to form a self-relying group into a credit association.&#13;
This will change now that the government credit lines are disappearing and that farmers will have to rely&#13;
more on themselves to obtain credit.  The survey will focus on socially and economically important&#13;
segments of the rural community in order (i) to determine to what extent development potential can be&#13;
achieved to improve family income; and (ii) determine to what extent rural credit/savings schemes&#13;
developed with the active managerial participation of beneficiaries can play a role to reach those&#13;
objectives.&#13;
1I. Objectives&#13;
8.      GOT and BNA want to know to what extent: (i) small farmers, craftsmen, rural women, and&#13;
laborers operating small plots of land are able, without major support, to organize at the village level (or&#13;
by group of villages) a sustainable, self-managed association whose primary aim is to take care of the&#13;
individual members' needs (including credit guarantees) to improve their family income and living&#13;
conditions; and (ii) the prevailing environment is conducive to encourage/support small farmers' groups.&#13;
9.    i The study would be carried out under the leadership of MOA  (DG/FE)1 assisted by the&#13;
"Ministere de la Femme et de la Famille" (MFF) to develop credit/savings schemes for women, and&#13;
advised by an advisory group composed of representatives of interested Ministries (Agriculture, Finance,&#13;
MFF, and Economic Development), the Central Bank, BNA, NGOs and of "Union Tunisienne de P'&#13;
Agriculture et de la Peche" (UTAP). Its purpose is to review the work done to date on the above subject&#13;
in Tunisia and take into account reforms of agricultural credit in other countries (Morocco and relevant&#13;
Asian countries in particular) which also face the support and promotion of independent private farmers'&#13;
credit organizations.  The study, technically, would be led by BNA.  The study will consider the&#13;
development of a pilot scheme in at least two different regions/Governorates to be implemented under&#13;
the National Rural Finance Project as of 1996/97, according to the timetable agreed on during&#13;
negotiations (paras. 13 and 14).&#13;

III. Scope of Work&#13;
10.    Specifically the Task Force will:&#13;
(a)   Review and analyze the operations of the CLCMs and the SCMAs, and of ongoing pilot&#13;
experiments of credit schemes with NGOs in Tunisia.&#13;
(b)   Review and analyze the credit/savings operations organized by small farmers and rural&#13;
women in the villages of Morocco and of some Asian countries.&#13;
(c)   Review the legislative and fiscal framework for farmers' organizations in Tunisia and&#13;
other relevant countries.&#13;
(d)   Review the farm holdings distribution, determine the small farmer families' geographical&#13;
location by agro-climatic zones in Tunisia.&#13;
(e)   Select within the two Governorates in Tunisia a village or group of villages which could&#13;
assemble a sufficient number of families involved in agriculture and off-farm activities&#13;
to form a primary group. These families should be surveyed to determine their&#13;
development priority needs, and their willingness to participate in and support a private&#13;
rural organization. These organizations should be managed by the members themselves&#13;
who would elect their own leaders and management. They should be operated for the&#13;
benefit of the members in such a way that revenues exceed costs.&#13;
(f)   Assess the most appropriate organizational forms possible and the minimum requirements&#13;
(statutes, number of members, types and volume of operations, accounting, auditing) to&#13;
make them operational.&#13;
(g)   Assess the financing system, profitability and sustainability of the most appropriate&#13;
organizational forms to be tested in Tunisia.&#13;
(h)   Recommend a course of action, or alternatives if appropriate, with a view to establishing&#13;
a village-based organization and making it operational on a pilot basis. Propose a&#13;
practical, phased plan of action for achieving the recommended objective.&#13;
IV. Work's Organization, Reporting Requirements and Time Schedule&#13;
11.    The proposed work is divided into three phases:&#13;
Phase I, Evaluation, Diagnostics and Survey, would address the analysis and review of points&#13;
(a) to (e) in para. 10 above. It would include the preparation and execution of the socio-economic&#13;
survey.&#13;
Phase II, Feasibility of Pilot Operations, would analyze the results of the survey and examine&#13;
the feasibility of developing pilot operations in well-selected areas (points (f) to (h) in para. 10).&#13;
&#13;

Force, under the leadership of MOA-DG/FE and assisted as needed by the MFF and by the Advisory&#13;
Committee, will guide and supervise the study-survey and be responsible for making the final&#13;
recommendations. The Task Manager ("Coordinateur Technique") of the study-survey would be a highly&#13;
qualified expert from BNA, assigned full time to the task. He would report to the Task Force's leader&#13;
(MOA-DG/FE). To carry out the study-survey, the Task Manager would be supported by two experts:&#13;
(i) a rural sociologist specialized in community development and rural participatory work ("animation&#13;
rurale"), and (ii) a rural finance specialist with a track record of experience in institutional development&#13;
and rural credit/savings. Professional staff ("enqueteurs/enquetrices") of the "Centre National des Etudes&#13;
Agricoles" (CNEA) would participate in the survey as necessary.&#13;
13.    The following reports shall be submitted:&#13;
(a)   Inception report. This will elaborate the program as necessary, including the survey&#13;
design, the questionnaire, selection of the village(s), and the number of families to be&#13;
surveyed, and identify issues for further investigation. The Task Force would provide&#13;
the report within 12 weeks of the start date for discussion and review by the MOA, the&#13;
Advisory Committee, and the Bank and supporting cofinanciers.&#13;
(b)   Draft study report. This will describe the study findings and recommendations in detail,&#13;
and should be submitted not later than eight months after commencement of work for&#13;
review and discussion by MOA, Advisory Committee and Bank/cofinanciers.&#13;
(c)   Final report.  The draft study report shall incorporate comments of the review in&#13;
(b) above and obtain the views and consultations of authorities as may be recommended&#13;
by the MOA, the Advisory Committee and the Bank/cofinanciers. The final report shall&#13;
be submitted by March 31, 1996 to the Ministry of Agriculture and to the&#13;
Bank/cofinanciers one month after the review under (b).&#13;
(d)   Pilot Scheme. Establish and develop the pilot organization(s), with a view to starting&#13;
implementation by November 1, 1996 for the 1996-1997 agricultural season.&#13;
14.    At negotiations, agreement was reached on a start date for the study (June 1995) including&#13;
confirmation of the composition of the Coordination Committee/Task Force and the nomination of the&#13;
Task Manager.&#13;

Project Implementation and Bank Supervision&#13;
A. Supervision Strategy&#13;
1.   Effective project implementation will be the key to the development impact of BNA in Tunisia.&#13;
Bank supervision strategy and plans will pay special attention to the institutional development objectives&#13;
of the project, and monitor closely the status of legal covenants and disbursemments. Supervision will&#13;
also be a joint effort with the Bank's cofinancier partners and will be carried out in full partnership with&#13;
BNA and in consultation with the Government on the points of accountability of the Guarantor (foreign&#13;
exchange risk coverage, financial sector liberalisation measures, study on group lending, and drought&#13;
management).&#13;
2.   Sustained supervision will be needed to keep BNA's institutional strengthening on track and to&#13;
monitor progress on the implementation of BNA's strategic plan, on the decentralization of its operations,&#13;
on the design and start-up of its new data processing and management information systems and control,&#13;
and training programs.&#13;
3.   The mid-term review will be a critical event in the supervision process.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
TUNISIA&#13;
NATIONAL RURAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
Conceptual Approach on a Rainfall-Based Insurance System&#13;
1. Background.&#13;
Because of the high degree of drought exposure there is a need for a formal risk management system in&#13;
Tunisian agriculture. At farmer level, there is a need for a mechanism to stabilise income over time, to&#13;
encourage investment, and to enable the farmer to remain credit-worthy in the event of severe crop&#13;
reduction or failure. At the Tunisian banks level, it is necessary to segregate natural risk from credit risk&#13;
if the problem of loan delinquency is to be managed more effectively. An effective risk management&#13;
system would maintain credit discipline. At the level of government, the benefits include stabilisation&#13;
of rural income, improved sustainability of credit within the rural sector, and national solidarity. An&#13;
effective insurance system against drought will reduce the need for, and costs of, ad-hoc disaster relief.&#13;
2. Fonds National de Garantie (FNG)&#13;
It is understood that GOT favors the promotion of rural risk management through an insurance&#13;
mechanism, but has not committed to provide finance for such a development. In the meantime,&#13;
government has taken measures, as part of the Rural Finance Project, to make the Fonds National de&#13;
Garantie (FNG) operational in respect of drought risk in agricultural loans.&#13;
3. Yield-based or Rainfall-based Insurance System?&#13;
First, since cereal yields in the central and southern parts of the country were previously shown' to be&#13;
uninsurable at acceptable premium levels, a yield-based system would not have provided drought&#13;
protection to a very wide area of the country. On the other hand, a commercial rainfall-based insurance&#13;
program would have a wider geographical scope. Details are available in Working Document No. 9, A&#13;
proposal for Rainfall-Based Insurance System, July 1994, by Mr. Sacay (FSD) and Mr. Dick&#13;
(Consultant).&#13;
Concept&#13;
4.   The study has developed proposals for a scheme where cumulative rainfall is used as an indicator&#13;
of drought severity. Fixed value coupons would be purchased by farmers prior to the growing season,&#13;
which would be encashed in the event that rainfall falls below defined threshold(s) at defined locations&#13;
Working Document No. 8, Agricultural Risk Management Strategy, January 1993, by Mr. Sacay (FSD) and&#13;
Mr. Dick (Consultant).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -                                   Annex 6&#13;
during the season. The concept is intended to stabilise rural incomes, rather than restitution of&#13;
production loss of crop farmers through indemnification of yield shortfall.&#13;
5.   Use of rainfall as the actuarial base for an insurance scheme offers the opportunity to derive&#13;
premium rates with far more confidence than is possible under a yield-based scheme. Crop yields are&#13;
subject to many variables, and the level of claims payable is dependent on assumptions of yield variation&#13;
at farmer level or, under an area-based system, yield variation within defined agro-climatic zones.&#13;
6.   A scheme with rainfall coupons is simpler and expected to be more easily understood by the rural&#13;
population than a yield-based insurance scheme. It can be operated at lower administrative costs, and&#13;
sales of coupons rather than individual insurance policies will require less skilled personnel.&#13;
7.   Although such a rainfall-based insurance could be developed nationwide, the scheme is most likely&#13;
to be useful to crop farmers in areas of higher rainfall, where there is a lower frequency of serious yield&#13;
shortfall caused by drought. Verification of rainfall is possible in Tunisia under contract with the Institut&#13;
National de M&amp;t6orologie.&#13;
Pilot Development&#13;
8.   It is advised that a rainfall-based insurance scheme be introduced on a pilot basis. The purpose&#13;
of the pilot phase would be to ensure that critical aspects of the system, and particularly the extension,&#13;
publicity and socio-economic impact, can be monitored and evaluated.&#13;
9.   The scheme could extend beyond simple rainfall insurance at further stages. For example, a&#13;
savings element could be introduced, with an endowment type product giving a value either at maturity&#13;
or in the event of drought. This product would, at a later stage, act as the collateral to allow micro-&#13;
enterprise lending of funds created by the savings plan. The micro-enterprises selected could be in&#13;
industries which are not susceptible to downturn in times of drought. The overall objective of rural&#13;
diversification, savings, investment, and income stability could be achieved.&#13;
Institutional Structure and Financial Management&#13;
10.  A rainfall-based insurance could be managed within the private sector by maintaining a low&#13;
recurrent annual cost structure for organisation, management and operations. In Tunisia, insurance&#13;
companies such as the Caisse Tunisienne des Assurances Mutuelles Agricoles (CTAMA) are interested.&#13;
CTAMA has established a network of regional offices, has strong relationships with farmer associations,&#13;
and is the lead agricultural insurer in Tunisia.&#13;
11.  For the scheme to work, however, a fund would have to be established and managed on a&#13;
sustainable basis, without subsidy, so that indemnities plus administration costs and profit equal premium&#13;
collected plus interest over a long term period.&#13;
12.  Reinsurance arrangements could also be contracted to a well known local reinsurance company.&#13;
There is one in Tunisia, Tunis-Re, which has been entrusted the administration of the FNG on behalf of&#13;
the GOT.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -                                  Annex 6&#13;
13.  The  rinancial management of the  rainfall scheme  should  conform  to  a  normal&#13;
insurance/reinsurance fund management, but extended to involve a contingent loan in the event of natural&#13;
catastrophe. A Primary Fund needs to be created with a view to be administered by an insurance&#13;
company or its subsidiary. The second tier of protection could be a level of Stop Loss Reinsurance to&#13;
be placed in the commercial reinsurance market, co-ordinated by a lead reinsurance company. The final&#13;
tier in the financial management of a rainfall scheme would be a Contingent Loan Arrangement&#13;
negotiated in advance of each crop season. There would be considerable advantages if a significant&#13;
Insurance Fund could be introduced at an early stage, to be managed professionally through reinsurance&#13;
and normal fund investment management.&#13;
14.  Government's Intentions&#13;
The GOT is committed to promoting the development of private commercial agricultural insurance (not&#13;
necessarly rainfall-based as such a scheme is still untested) as part of its dialogue with the Bank on private&#13;
sector development.&#13;

TUNISIA&#13;
NATIONAL RURAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
BNA's On-Lending Procedures, and Appraisal and Approval Methods&#13;
1.   Purpose of BNA Subloans. The purpose of BNA subloans is to provide improved access to&#13;
investment credit and savings schemes to eligible private clients principally in the rural population&#13;
including the poorest segments. This will be achieved through the financing of viable farm households&#13;
and enterprises, and the opening of market access under market conditions to previously excluded groups&#13;
such as micro-enterprise, creditworthy small farmers and rural women.&#13;
2.   Interest Rates and Spreads. BNA will apply market rates except for priority activities where&#13;
highly positive regulated rates apply (para. 3.07 of main report). Average on-lending rates at BNA are,&#13;
in practice, around MMR plus 3% with savings rates at MMR minus 1%, leaving a margin of up to 4%&#13;
on credit/savings schemes. Interest rates and spreads will be monitored on an annual basis to ensure that&#13;
they cover average financial and operating cost and credit risk.&#13;
3.   Subloans Maturities. The repayment period for medium- and long-term subloans would be based&#13;
on the subproject's cash flow and related to the subborrower's overall repayment capacity. Repayment&#13;
of most subloans for medium-term will be in 5 to 7 years, and for long-term in 10 to 15 years, or the&#13;
economic life of the sub-project, whichever is lower. A grace period now ranging from I to 5 years may&#13;
be granted for repayment based on the subproject's cash flow and the overall financial status of the&#13;
subborrower. Subloans will be secured by collateral consistent with current banking practices in Tunisia.&#13;
4.   Subloan Size. Under the Project, the average size of subloans will vary from TD 4,000 to 10,000&#13;
for small and medium farmers, rural women and small fishermen; may go up to TD 50,000 for large&#13;
farmers; vary from TD 5,000 to 15,000 for rural housing; and will be less than TD 700,000 for most&#13;
major agricultural and agro-fishery enterprises. Proposed BNA subloans above TD I million would&#13;
require Bank approval before financing.&#13;
5.   Subborrower's contribution. A subborrower's contribution to the investment cost of a subproject&#13;
would be determined by BNA on the basis of the subproject appraisal. On average, subborrower's&#13;
contribution would be as follows: (a) small and medium farmers, cooperatives, rural women, micro-&#13;
enterprises, small fishermen and rural housing, 10%; and (b) large farmers/fishermen, large agricultural&#13;
enterprises and agro-industries, 30%.&#13;
6.   Subloan Appraisal and Approval. Subloan appraisal and approval will be the responsibility of&#13;
BNA, which can consult CRDA's staff in the field for technical advice on appraisal of farm investments.&#13;
7.   Appraisal of subloans to agro-investors. For these projects, BNA will conduct environmental&#13;
impact assessments and can use the following additional financial measurements case-by-case to cross-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -                                     Annex 7&#13;
check internal rate of return (IRR) and net return on equity (ROE) calculations.'&#13;
(a)    current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of at least 1.3, as computed from the basic&#13;
financial statements of the last five years;&#13;
(b)   long-term debt to equity ratio, after the proposed loan has been made, preferably not over&#13;
2 to I; and&#13;
(c)   ratio of cash flow after taxes to long-term debt service of at least 1.3, as estimated from&#13;
projected cash flow statements on five years. Cash flow should include net profit after&#13;
taxes, depreciation, and annual financial charges on long-term debt; long-term debt service&#13;
includes principal and interest.&#13;
Regarding investments for newly created enterprises the ratio analysis will be done on the basis of&#13;
projected financial statements only.&#13;
8.    Appraisal of Subloans to Farmers, Rural Women, Micro-enterprises, Cooperatives and&#13;
Fishermen. Investment lending to farmers, cooperatives, rural women, entrepreneurs, and selected&#13;
fishermen will be subject to a techno-economic and financial appraisal carried out by BNA's field staff&#13;
under the guidance of BNA headquarters. The objective of the appraisal would be to demonstrate that:&#13;
(a) the proposed investments are sound on technical, environmental and economic grounds, and are&#13;
financially viable based on subproject's financial plan and cash flow analysis; and (b) the subloan&#13;
applicants are creditworthy, and will carry out the subproject. As calculations of financial rates of return&#13;
(FRRs) for all subloans would be impractical, BNA will calculate an FRR for typical subprojects in each&#13;
principal activity financed. For small farm loans and single specific investments, separate feasibility&#13;
studies will be replaced by standardized loan packages for various categories of investment to speed up&#13;
approval decisions, disbursement and implementation, and to minimize transaction costs.&#13;
9.   Disbursement and Supervision of Subloans. Disbursement and supervision of subloans will be&#13;
handled by BNA headquarters, and be delegated to the branches. BNA would require subborrowers to&#13;
use project funds for approved purposes. This would be achieved through direct payments to suppliers,&#13;
and semi-annual visits to subprojects by BNA's field staff as may be prescribed by BNA's Headquarters.&#13;
Follow-up reports on medium- and long-term loans would comment briefly on utilization of subloan&#13;
funds, compare actual and planned operations, review farmers' management and financial problems, and&#13;
make recommendations. BNA's headquarters staff would then do selective field visits to problem&#13;
operations for assessment of their problems and solutions.&#13;
10.  Risk of Default on Subloans. BNA will assume 100% of the normal lending risk of default on&#13;
subloans.&#13;
11.  Delegation of Loan Approval.  BNA  Regional Directorates are authorized to approve:&#13;
(a) medium- and long-term investments up to TD 120,000; and (b) short-term loans, (not for World Bank&#13;
financing) for new borrowers, ranging from TD 10,000 to 25,000, varying from one crop to a&#13;
combination of crops, and for previous borrowers who have a satisfactory recovery rate, similar amounts&#13;
On IRR and ROE a hurdle rate (cut-off rate) will be introduced for accepting or reiecting investment Droposals BNA&#13;
normally requires that IRR (over about 20 yearsJ should be about 12 % to make a limited risk 'accept " decision, but it&#13;
does not automatically reiect a ororosed investment with a 10% IRR if additional measurements show that the investment&#13;
is sound. ROE calculations would be over 12 to 20 years dependinz on the timing for assets renewal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -                                       Annex 7&#13;
with the discretion to increase these by a margin of about 25 % provided they do not exceed the ceilings&#13;
per ha established annually by BNA. All loans above these amounts require approval from headquarters.&#13;
12.   Collateral. Subloans will be secured by collateral or other guarantees consistent with current&#13;
banking practices in Tunisia. However, BNA will take into account the specific conditions prevailing&#13;
in rural areas, in particular the absence of clear title on land held by potential subborowers. Collateral&#13;
requirements will be eased for rural women to allow personal collateral or signature of a third party.&#13;
13.   Measures to Increase Loan Collections. Specific measures to increase future loan collections&#13;
under the project will include the following:&#13;
(a)    better selection of viable clients:&#13;
(b)    strengthening of BNA's recently created Recovery Unit, special incentives to personnel of&#13;
BNA to collect loan arrears, and close monitoring of recovery plans;&#13;
(c)    deducting loan repayments from crop payment;&#13;
(d)    denying further credit to borrowers in arrears;&#13;
(e)    application of penalty charges on loan accounts in arrears;&#13;

Government. at BNA's request and under certain conditions, to enforce the recoverv of loans to farmers in serious&#13;
default throueh the tax coUectors of the Ministry of Finance. In the past. the Government of Tunisia has been reluctant&#13;
to use this privilege against farmers except as a threat.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
TUNISIA&#13;
NATIONAL RURAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
Agricultural Sector Performance, Sector Challenges and Bank's Role in the Agriculture Sector&#13;
1.   Background. Agriculture plays an essential role in Tunisia's economy. It generates 16% of GDP,&#13;
employs almost one out of every three workers in the labor force, and contributes about 11 % to total&#13;
export earnings. However, these averages mask significant annual fluctuations due to the fact that&#13;
agriculture is predominantly rainfed. Only 5% of cropped land is irrigated, but these areas contribute&#13;
a much higher share of sector value added than non-irrigated areas. In order to counteract the production&#13;
uncertainties of irregular rainfall, development of irrigation is receiving high priority. Agricultural&#13;
products are essential inputs into processing industries, which account for 20% of manufacturing value&#13;
added. Out of a total land area of 16.4 million hectares (ha) in Tunisia, only 8.4 million are suitable for&#13;
agriculture and grazing. Cultivable land amounts to 5.3 million ha, of which 25% are devoted to cereals,&#13;
35% to crop trees, 10% to forage crops, fruits and vegetables, grain legumes and industrial crops, and&#13;
20% left fallow. Animal husbandry is a major activity, with the majority of the national herd's&#13;
624 thousand heads of cattle and 6.5 million small ruminants raised on small farms.&#13;
2.   Farm Households and Income. While Tunisian agriculture is predominantly rainfed, a majority&#13;
of Tunisian farmers work small holdings with low income. According to the 1989 agricultural survey&#13;
(see Annex 1), out of the estimated total of 387,100 holdings engaged in some form of agricultural&#13;
production, 330,000 are small. Thus, 85% of farmers own farms of sizes no larger than 20 ha, which&#13;
constitute 39% of a total agricultural land surface area of 5.3 million ha. The average farm size is 15 ha,&#13;
broken up into four parcels, each averaging 3.7 ha. Only 36% of irrigated acreage belongs to small&#13;
farmers. On these meager land resources, sources of household income are diversified between crop and&#13;
livestock and between farm and off-farm. According to the 1985 consumption survey, rural household&#13;
income averaged US$2,646 (US$441 per capita) while urban household income averaged US$3,250&#13;
(US$929 per capita). Against a national GNP per capita of US$1260 (1989 $), expenditure per capita&#13;
in rural areas was estimated by the 1990 consumption survey of the Institut National de la Statistique to&#13;
be around US$494, that is 40 % of national average income (at the 1989 exchange rate of TD 0.93/US$ 1).&#13;
As a comparison, urban expenditure was US$957.1 Based on the 1984 population census, updated in&#13;
1989,r 120,000 heads of households consider farm activity their principal activity. This represents about&#13;
30% of the country's total farm units. Another 40% have declared themselves as part time farmers and&#13;
off farm activity to be their principal activity. The balance of 30% have declared a limited activity in&#13;
agriculture together with other sources of income but without explicit specification about distribution&#13;

la Pauvrete, Identification/Preparation, report no. 30/92 CP-TUN 72, FAO, 30 March 1992, Annex 1, pg 2. Rural&#13;
household size is 6 persons and urban is 3.5. The TD/US exchange rate is 0.82 for 1985 and 0.93 for 1989.&#13;
Income per capita in 1991 is estimated at US $1,537.&#13;

between farm and off-farm.2 With rainfall ranging from 1200 mm annually in the North to less than&#13;
200 mm in the South, chronic vulnerability to droughts, and meager land resources, diversification is&#13;
central to risk management by small farm households.3&#13;
3.    Recent Reforms and Sector Performance. Significant liberalization of the agricultural sector is&#13;
occurring with strong Government commitment. Reforms span divestiture of numerous parastatal&#13;
activities, reduction of input subsidies and introduction of market forces in price mechanisms, reductions&#13;
in government subsidies and introduction of market forces in price mechanisms, reductions in government&#13;
subsidies to credit programs and in interest rate subsidies, and strengthening of public sector support&#13;
services. The sector is emerging strongly from several drought years, averaging over 4 percent annual&#13;
growth over 1991-93 after achieving only 1.5 percent in the latter 1980s, with exports growing at about&#13;
13% annually.&#13;
4.    Sector Challenges.4 Rapid changes and introduction of new technologies are modernizing parts&#13;
of the sector, facilitated by increasing market openness and orientation to export opportunities, principally&#13;
in European markets. But while the agricultural sector is becoming more flexible and responsive, more&#13;
resource-constrained rural areas continue to be a policy preoccupation, especially since pockets of rural&#13;
poverty, lack of job opportunities for rural youth, and general problems of natural resource degradation&#13;
continue to evade solutions. The Government is addressing these issues through building a stronger&#13;
partnership with the private sector in agriculture, which it has begun through decentralizing and&#13;
disengaging from numerous activities.&#13;
5.    Key measures to improve on performance are in five areas: (i) promoting private investment--&#13;
through strengthening of rural financial markets, completing market liberalization, and improving&#13;
access to technology; (ii) reforming land tenure--through interventions to prevent farm fragmentation,&#13;
to promote consolidation, and to improve formal land titling; (iii) involving local communities--by&#13;
solidifying the legal standing of community groups involved in the use of natural resources such as&#13;
forests, pastures and water and promoting such groups through technical support and through project&#13;
design; (iv) reducing rural poverty--through project approaches that integrate agricultural productivity,&#13;
non-farm income generation and social service; and (v) strengthening sectoral administration--by&#13;
consolidating the transfer of various technical, budget and policy responsibilities to regional offices, and&#13;
by shifting public sector capacity from direct production activities of the past towards service delivery&#13;
and policy functions.&#13;
6.    Bank's Role in the Agricultural Sector. Bank group lending to Tunisia began in 1967. To date,&#13;
105 loans and credits have been made, supported by US$4.6 billion Bank and IDA funds, net of&#13;
cancellations. In agriculture, 17 projects have been completed and six are being implemented, totalling&#13;
US$720.9 million of Bank group lending. These include: four agricultural credit projects (FY72, 77,&#13;
81 and 88), all completed; two fisheries projects, the First and Second Fisheries Projects (FY72 and 80),&#13;
both completed; seven irrigation projects, of which four are completed - Irrigation Rehabilitation (FY75),&#13;
Sidi Salem Multipurpose Irrigation (FY78), Southern Irrigation (FY79), Medjerda/Nebhana Irrigation&#13;

Loans (FY87 and 89), one of which has been satisfactorily completed and the second one being recently&#13;
completed; two ongoing Forestry Development Projects (FY88 and 93); an Agricultural Research and&#13;
Extension Project (FY91); an Agricultural Sector Investment Loan (FY94); and a poverty alleviation&#13;
project: the Northwest Mountainous Areas Development Project (FY94). The Technical Assistance&#13;
Project (FY83, completed) included an agriculture component. The Bank supervised the IFAD financed&#13;
Sidi Bouzid Irrigation Project (FY84, completed). Five main themes permeate this portfolio of projects,&#13;
namely efficiency improvements;  production and income increases;  forestry and environmental&#13;
protection; poverty alleviation; and institution strengthening. The irrigation projects, which have&#13;
absorbed the lion's share of the Bank's project lending in agriculture, have focused on improved&#13;
rehabilitation, cost recovery, and management of existing systems so as to reduce water losses, increase&#13;
reliability of water delivery, and thus encourage adoption of more productive technologies. Performance&#13;
of Bank-financed projects in agriculture has generally been satisfactory.&#13;
7.   Significant policy reforms were achieved under the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loans,&#13;
ASAL I and II. In line with the economy-wide emphasis on efficiency through liberalization, the&#13;
Medium-Term Agricultural Sector Adjustment Program (MTASAP, 1986-1991) through its two loans,&#13;
ASAL I in 1987 and ASAL II in 1989, has sought to reduce distortions in output and input prices, and&#13;
put private enterprises on an equal footing with public enterprises. Specifically, with respect to prices,&#13;
incentives and marketing, the ASALs have: (i) linked domestic prices of cereals to world prices and&#13;
reduced input subsidies to better reflect opportunity costs (e.g., cereals and milk, fertilizer, improved&#13;
cereal seed and animal feed); (ii) removed restrictions on private sector exports and imports of basic food&#13;
commodities (e.g., olive and vegetable oils); (iii) eliminated to a large extent legal barriers to entry of&#13;
domestic markets (e.g., cereals); (iv) decontrolled domestic processing (vegetable oils); and (v) ensured&#13;
that parastatal subsidies do not undercut private sector participation (beef). With respect to strengthening&#13;
essential public services, the approach has been to reorganize services like research and extension and&#13;
to make the distribution of inputs financially attractive to the private sector through the following&#13;
measures: (i) equalizing distribution margins between parastatal and private (fertilizer); (ii) phasing out&#13;
subsidies and removing legal monopolies (cereal seeds); and (iii) reducing tariffs and removing&#13;
restrictions on tractor imports.&#13;
8.   The Agricultural Sector Investment Loan  (ASIL), approved  in November 1993, is&#13;
complementing these policy reforms through improved management of public resources in irrigation and&#13;
water-use efficiency, natural resource management, animal health and production, and land consolidation.&#13;
9.   Reform was also initiated in agricultural credit by the Tunisians with Bank support for the period&#13;
1987-1991 under the Fourth Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 2865-TUN).&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
TUNISIA&#13;
NATIONAL RURAL FINANCE PROJECT&#13;
A. BNA Supervised Credit Program for Small Farmers&#13;
Background and Rationale&#13;
I .   In 1993 when GOT opted to disengage itself from countrywide direct agricultural credit operations,&#13;
GOT and BNA examined what could be done: (i) to expand small farmers outreach to the formal credit&#13;
system in the immediate future; and (ii) to improve the credit delivery system through alternative&#13;
institutional arrangements in the longer run.&#13;
2.   Accessibility to credit by small farmers is limited because many live far from a bank branch (few&#13;
clients of banks are more than 10 km away from a branch) and/or because small farmers remain hesitant&#13;
to contact bank officials. From the perspective of the banking system, broader coverage means higher&#13;
transaction costs. These costs and climatic risks are among the main reasons given not to expand their&#13;
coverage.&#13;
3.   With regard to aspect (i) above, BNA, with MOA's support, decided that its small farmers&#13;
category (already included in its regular credit program) could be enlarged, provided assistance from&#13;
MOA's extension services could be obtained for handling additional clients. As a result a "Supervised&#13;
Credit Program" (SCP) was developed targeting creditworthy small farmers, previously beneficiaries of&#13;
GOT credit lines, as well as those potentially creditworthy. Concerning aspect (ii), MOA, with BNA's&#13;
support, decided to conduct a study to explore how small farmers could organize themselves at the village&#13;
level in self help group lending associations (see Annex No. 4). The idea is that by joining together,&#13;
small holders can reduce costs of borrowing, keep collection rates high and improve access to credit.&#13;
Finally, regarding the climatic risk, GOT decided to restructure and make the Fonds National de Garantie&#13;
(FNG) operational and, complement the FNG by introducing a "Rainfall Insurance System" on a pilot&#13;
basis.&#13;
4.   Objectives: The key objective is to develop a SCP to reach creditworthy small farmers, previously&#13;
beneficiaries of GOT credit lines, as well as those potentially creditworthy. This supervised program&#13;
would aim at reaching small farmers with incomes in the range of TD 1 100 to 2500 and operating farm&#13;
units varying from 2 to 10 ha (partly irrigated) and from 5 to 50 ha in rainfed. These small farmers have&#13;
the possibility of increasing their incomes through diversification, better use of farm land and a fuller&#13;
employment of family labor.&#13;
5.   Scope and Size: In designing the program, two main factors determined the size and scope of the&#13;
SCP: (1) locating areas where small farms are predominant and have production systems which can be&#13;
intensified. A first group of farms has been identified in the Northern part of the country and an other&#13;
one in the Center-South; and (2) a credit delivery system keeping transaction costs reasonable while&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -                                  Annex 9&#13;
taking BNA's present branch network and resources into account. BNA estimates that through this joint&#13;
effort an additional 9,400 small farmers (men and women) and 450 fishermen can be reached over the&#13;
next three years in addition to the 13,800 small farmers of its regular credit program. Table 1, below,&#13;
shows the SCP total investment cost and financing; and, Table 2, the SCP credit program by year.&#13;
6.   Organization: In order to increase BNA's outreach capability, beyond its regular credit program,&#13;
an arrangement between MOA and BNA was worked out to make extension services available and assist&#13;
BNA in the credit cycle process. Under the SCP, BNA retains the responsibility to appraise and approve&#13;
loans while MOA, through its extension services, would assist BNA in identifying the beneficiaries and&#13;
in providing technical assistance during supervision. BNA can also, when appropriate, request assistance&#13;
of the extension services in the collection of due loans. BNA assumes full risk for these operations. The&#13;
respective responsibilities of BNA and MOA are determined in a circular (September 3, 1993) issued by&#13;
BNA's management.&#13;
7.   The new Directorate in charge of lending to small-and medium-size farmers within BNA is also&#13;
responsible for the development and implementation of the supervised credit program as well as for the&#13;
coordination of all activities with MOA in accordance with BNA's circular of September 3, 1993. At&#13;
the regional level, BNA's branch manager, with the agricultural staff's assistance, has the task to&#13;
coordinate all supervised credit activities with the representative of MOA.&#13;

B. Project Impact on Beneficiaries&#13;
8.   BNA assumes full risk for all credit operations. Its financing approach will help increase and&#13;
secure farmers income (particularly for small-and medium-size farmers) by supporting crop&#13;
intensification, diversification in crop mix and improving the quality of farm produce. The main&#13;
technical inputs that would contribute to productivity increases and better use of existing resources are:&#13;
selected seed, fertiliser, land preparation and development of irrigation. These inputs would be used in&#13;
adapted farm plans combining, according to the circumstances, existing crops with the introduction of&#13;
fruit trees, vegetables, and livestock. The diversification in crop/produce mix aims at reducing and&#13;
spreading the risks by lowering the dependency on cereal production. Cereal yields are most vulnerable&#13;
to drought which occurs every four to five years, with varying degrees of intensity.&#13;
9.   To quantify the returns to sub-borrowers, BNA has submitted 12 farm models. Of these, five&#13;
models illustrate the approach under the supervised credit program (models #1 to 5 in tables 3 and 4).&#13;
They were chosen to represent the range of activities that would be made in irrigated areas, first, of&#13;
Kalaat Landalous--Governorate of Ariana (introduction of pure bred dairy) and, second, in Sidi&#13;
M'habheb--Governorate of Sfax (development of fruit trees). The farm models are based on estimates&#13;
of BNA staff, specialized in reviewing the technical parameters of potential investors, and, the&#13;
information on input levels, farming techniques and yields are based on the combined judgement of BNA&#13;
and MOA staff famniliar with agricultural practices in those specific areas. In practice, many combinations&#13;
of these model investments and other cropping patterns would exist under the project.  Table 3&#13;
summarizes the effect on investors incomes, FRRs and ERRs; and Table 4, shows the sensitivity on&#13;
returns due to variations in benefits, operating and investments cost. The models are illustrative only.&#13;
The detailed models, including the conversion factors, are available in the project working document&#13;
No. 11.&#13;
10. The effect on farmers' incomes, starting from a low base, would be substantial at full development.&#13;
Increased income, calculated in constant 1994 prices, in the farm models is expected from: (a) more&#13;
intensive cultivation and reduced fallow in the case of irrigation equipment; (b) upgraded quality of the&#13;
livestock through purchase of pure bred cattle and better animal feed and health; and (c) improved yields&#13;
in the case of all farm models.&#13;

Table 16: Basic Assumptions for BNA's Financial Projections (Part 1)&#13;
BNA's financial projections for the period 1995-1998 are based on 1994 actuals and on the various measures BNA's&#13;
management is in the process of implementing and are spelled out in the action plan. The assumptions are as follows:&#13;
Sight deposits increasing by about 7% each year, and term deposits and savings by 10%;&#13;
Uncollected loans, of past GOT credit schemes restructured and transferred to BNA by GOT within&#13;
the framework of the capital fund of TD 133million (implementation agreement signed March 25,&#13;
1995) are expected to be recovered over a twenty-year period; loans collected and guaranteed in 1994&#13;
were TD5.0 million. Loans to be collected for the period 1995-1998 (including the amounts to be&#13;
received through the agreed GOT guarantee are expected to be TD6.9 million in 1995, 20.7 million in&#13;
1996, 12.2 million in 1997, and 10.6 million in 1998. Interest due on these loans will remain with&#13;
GOT;&#13;
Past advances (TD54 million of principal and interests due as of December 31, 1994) made by BNA&#13;
on account of GOT's budgetary resources will be reimbursed by GOT over a five year period (1994-&#13;
1998; TD36.8 million were repaid in 1994. Out of the TD54 million remaining due, it is expected&#13;
that TDIO million would be repaid in 1995, 15 million in 1996, 15 million in 1997 and 14 million in&#13;
1998;&#13;
Recovery Rates:&#13;
(a) in agriculture               for loans made after January 1, 1994: 90%&#13;
for loans made prior to January 1, 1994: 75% on outstanding&#13;
loans; 30% on arrears of less than one year; and 10% on arrears of&#13;
more than one year;&#13;
(b) in industry and commerce:    for loans made after January 1, 1994: 95%;&#13;
for loans made prior to January 1, 1994. 88% in 1994, increasing&#13;
to 94% in 1997 and 1998.&#13;
*   BNA considers that, by June 30, 1996, it will obtain for its commitments to large public enterprises,&#13;
additional guarantees from the GOT amounting to TD40 million for the Office des Cereales (OC)&#13;
and TD1O million for Groupe Chimique.&#13;

Table 16: Basic Assumptions for BNA's Financial Projections (Part 2)&#13;
* BNA's projected lending program:&#13;
Based on (i) BNA's action plan for 1994-1997 (1998 has been extrapolated), (ii) the ongoing restructuring of&#13;
BNA's portfolio for improved quality, (iii) BNA's new credit policies for better client selection in particular&#13;
in agriculture, (iv) Government priorities and objectives (the Eighth plan), and (v) the private sector demand&#13;
for credit to finance agricultural and industrial investments and commercial/export activities, BNA's total&#13;
lending is projected to increase at an annual growth rate of about 7% in real term, including agriculture. The&#13;
project would provide BNA with the long-term resources (US$125 million plus an ADB loan of US$62&#13;
million already effective) to finance its medium- and long-term lending program in agriculture and related&#13;
activities. It is also assumed that BNA will disburse about US$5 million of IBRD money to finance industrial&#13;
investments under the Private Investment Credit Project (PICP).&#13;
* Interest Income and Expenses.&#13;
The spread between money market rates and BNA's average on-lending rate would be about 3%. The net&#13;
margin on credit/saving schemes would be no less than 4%. No interest income are accrued on arrears of&#13;
more than 90 days. Interest expenses include fees for exchange risk coverage on Bank loans. Reduction in&#13;
interest expenses are computed taking account of the proposed reduction of BNA's exposure to three large&#13;
public enterprises, as these commitments are essentially financed out of costly resources raised at money&#13;
market rates.&#13;
* Other Income:&#13;
Government fees to BNA for managing (at GOT's risk) the four remaining Government credit lines will cover&#13;
100% of administrative costs involved, plus financial incentives for loan collection, in accordance with the&#13;
agreement signed between the GOT and BNA on March 24, 1995.&#13;
* Operating Expenses:&#13;
Operating expenses would be contained within reasonable limits and training expenses are expected to&#13;
generate substantial productivity gains. On that basis, expenses are projected to increase by about 7 % a year&#13;
keeping in mind the strengthening of BNA agricultural credit outreach and rural savings mobilization&#13;
capacity.&#13;
* Provisions:&#13;
Provision shortfalls as of end December 1994 (TD 201 million) would be gradually reduced, and eliminated&#13;
in 1999, in compliance with the Central Bank prudential regulations and auditors recommendations. New&#13;
provision policies are stricly applied to new loans made as of January 1, 1994.&#13;
*  The resulting BNA Projected Financial Statements are in Tables 17 to 19. A prudent scenario has been&#13;
retained for financial projections after examining three different scenarios and progress trends because some&#13;
GOT decisions (e.g. reducing BNA's overdraft exposure to public enterprises) are not under the full control&#13;
of BNA.&#13;

Table 24: Development Impact Indicators&#13;
I.    In addition to the financial impact and institutional development indicators selected to measure&#13;
BNA performance under the project (Table 5 and Annex 3), simple development impact indicators are&#13;
proposed to monitor the poverty reduction effort under the Loan so as to measure BNA impact on the&#13;
development of the rural sector in Tunisia.&#13;
2.     Development Impact Indicators:&#13;
A.    25% of the loan amount is disbursed for small                           HS&#13;
and medium farmers, small fishermen, rural women,              (Highly Satisfactory)&#13;
artisans, service cooperatives supporting small farmers, and rural housing&#13;
B.    20 to 25% of the loan amount                                             S&#13;
(Satisfactory)&#13;
C.     10 to 20% of the loan amount                                            A&#13;
(Average)&#13;
D.    Less than 10% of loan amount                                            U&#13;
(U nsatisfactory)&#13;
3.     The indicative, demand driven, disbursement plan (para. 5.26 of main report, Table 10) shows&#13;
that disbursement categories 2; 4 (up to 60%); 5 (up to 20%); 6; and 7 are to be used for the&#13;
measurement of the poverty reduction effort of BNA under the loan. (See also Table 16 part 3).&#13;
4.     As part of project monitoring and evaluation activities (para. 6.13 of main report) and of project&#13;
supervision, any additional indicators--quantitative as well as qualitative--may be analyzed (number of&#13;
subloans and beneficiaries by category and by region, number of savings accounts open by this low&#13;
income clientele, marketing effort made by BNA's branch network to improve services, results of&#13;
representative investment operations, productive jobs creation, agricultural output, and loan collection&#13;
performance) to complete or interpret the above development impact indicators, and to evaluate them in&#13;
the overall context of the whole operation with BNA.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The primary objectives of the National
            Rural Finance Project are to assist Tunisia and BNA (Banque
            Nationale Agricole) in promoting viable private investment
            in rural areas and in strengthening, on a sustainable basis,
            the financial viability and institutional reform process of
            BNA in order to improve its development impact on the
            country's rural sector. Specifically, the project will
            fund: 1) medium- and long-term credit to private farmers and
            investors to finance a wide range of investments including
            irrigation development with water conservation measures,
            livestock and forage development, tree crop plantation,
            forestry development, farm equipment, storage facilities,
            greenhouses, agro-processing plants, coastal fisheries,
            rural housing, and rural non-farm investments; and 2)
            project-related training, consulting services for the
            strengthening of BNA management, planning, computerization,
            rural outreach, and internal controls. A mid-term review
            will assess progress made during implementation.
