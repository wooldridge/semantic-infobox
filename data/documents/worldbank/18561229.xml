[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Today is September 2, 2005. My name is Charles Ziegler, a consultant for the Oral&#13;
History Program of the World Banlc I am at the home of Jamil Sopher to conduct an oral history&#13;
interview.&#13;
&#13;
J amil joined the Bank in 1979 as a Financial Analyst in the South Asia Region and speqt most of&#13;
his career working on various countries in Asia, eventually reaching the position of Principal&#13;
Financial Analyst. Jamil also was very active in the Staff Association, in particular as Co-&#13;
chaitman of its Compensation Working Group and as Chairman of the Staff Association in 1998&#13;
and 1999. He closed out his career in the World Bank as an Operations Advisor in the Quality&#13;
Assurance Group, retiring in 2000. Since then, Jamil has set up his own consulting business&#13;
whose primary client is the World Bank Group.&#13;
&#13;
My association with Jamil goes back to the late 1980s when we worked together on the Staff&#13;
Association's Compensation Working Group. We also served together on the Staff Association's&#13;
Executive Committee.&#13;
&#13;
So, Jfamil, it's a great pleasure to interview you for the program, and I think that your interview&#13;
will add a lot to the knowledge and understanding by people of the World Bank and how it&#13;
worked in the late 1980s and 1990s. To start, by way ofbackground, can you say something&#13;
brieHy about the details of your early life?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, I was born in New York during World War II. My parents at the time were&#13;
French citizens, so I am a 'dual national. I spent a lot of time while I was young attending school&#13;
in New York City, but then going to France during vacations.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Were these public schools in New York?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Private schools. And so, you know, there is a certain degree to which I absorbed&#13;
French culture and also, being a dual national, I was very aware of that side of it.&#13;
&#13;
I went to Cornell University and got my bachelor of science and my master's in engineering,&#13;
electrical engineering, and from there, I went to Harvard Business School, where I got my&#13;
M.B.A. [Master of Business Administration] in 1968. You probably remember, Chuck, that in&#13;
those days, you got out of school, and the military was the option ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Ah, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: .. and the military option implied Vietnam. So, instead of taking the normal route&#13;
that an M.B.A. takes, I found myself an opportunity to teach at the U.S. Merchant Marine&#13;
Academy that made me a Lieutenant Junior Grade in the U.S. Maritime Service, and at that&#13;
point, I completed my military obligation by serving two years there.&#13;
&#13;
From there I went into investment banking. I had two stints on Wall Street, one with a firm&#13;
named H. Hentz and Company and the other with D.H. Blair and Company, and I learned the&#13;
rudiments of corporate finance, and from about mid-1973 to late 1978 I was in business for&#13;
myself. My primary office was at a company called the J.G. White Engineering Corporation,&#13;
and I tried to do project finance for them. And that was about half of my time, and the other half&#13;
of my time I spent doing some deals for my own account.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: How did you wind up working for the World Bank, then?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, there is an element of accident about it, to be honest. I was pretty unhappy&#13;
with some of the deals that I had put together in the late '70s, and so I began answering ads when&#13;
I saw them in The New York Times, and one of them was from the World Bank, and I sent them&#13;
my resume.&#13;
&#13;
It was one of the few periods in Bank history when they didn't require a photograph. The folks&#13;
at Personnel took a look at my name; they figured right away that I've got to be black, and they&#13;
decided that there were too few American blacks at the Bank at the time, and they wanted to&#13;
interview me. They were extremely disappointed to find out that, you know, I was not.&#13;
&#13;
But by then, I went through the interviews, made some friends, particularly a friendship with&#13;
Frank Lamson-Scribner, who was the Division Chief for Energy and Water Supply in South&#13;
Asia. And when the Bank turned me down, Frank offered me a consultancy. The first&#13;
consultancy was to do the appraisal of the Second Dhaka Water Supply Project, and ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What year was this Consultancy, then, do you recall?&#13;
&#13;
SOI'HER: Frank brought me on around the 15th ofNovember in '78. A week later, I was on a&#13;
plane to Bangladesh, and I completed the appraisal there in the middle of December.&#13;
&#13;
Frank came out during our appraisal mission, and he was very happy with the work I was doing&#13;
and really warmed up to me personally. Also the engineer that I was working with, a fellow&#13;
named John Pettigrew, was a terrific mentor, a great mentor, a great guy, and so, you know, with&#13;
that kind of support, it was pretty much impossible to do a bad appraisal.&#13;
&#13;
The appraisal was very, very well-received. Ernie [Ernest] Stem, at that time the Senior Vice&#13;
President for Operations, he--before he had come to the World Bank, he had been a director for&#13;
U.S . AID [Agency for International Development] for South Asia, and he also knew about the&#13;
Dhaka Water Supply Project, so when we completed the appraisal, Ernie wanted to see it, and he,&#13;
too, was very happy with the work that was done. So that meant that, you know, despite any&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
misgivings Personnel might have had, it was inevitable that the Bank was going to make me an&#13;
offer.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I'm going to digress for just a moment; the mention of Ernie Stem makes me think&#13;
about it. As you know, especially in the early '90s under Lew [Lewis T.] Preston, the Bank was&#13;
really, really criticized from many points of view but even its own internal [Willi W. A.]&#13;
Wapenhans report ...&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: ... was highly critical of way the Bank was doing its bread-and-butter project&#13;
work, as I recall.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Ernie Stem pretty much ran the place before that time.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yup.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Can a lot of this be laid at his door, or is it more far-reaching than that? Do you&#13;
want to stick your neck out on this one?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, you know, to be frank about it, I was no great fan of Ernie's personally, but I&#13;
think it's a real stretch to lay this at his feet. Ernie was Senior Vice President for Operations in&#13;
the early '80s, and he was Managing Director in charge of Operations in the '90s. He was&#13;
dealing with a very, very different Bank culture in both of those periods, and ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: A different culture from?&#13;
&#13;
SOFâ&#128;¢HER: One from the other, okay?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, okay.&#13;
&#13;
SOIâ&#128;¢HER: The culture in the '90s was very different from the culture in the early '80s, and the&#13;
thing that created the change was the '87 reorganization. And my view of it is that, you k:now,&#13;
Ernie's work was very effective in the early '80s, the directions he pushed were very effective,&#13;
and he was a lot less effective in the '90s because he was dealing with a different organization.&#13;
Now, what I don't know is whether Ernie understood that at the time, but, you know, that's for&#13;
others to ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Sorry to digress, but it is something that has been on my mind, and when you&#13;
addressed that--mentioned Ernie Stem, I thought it might be worth addressing here and now.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Ernie Stem was a classic control executive. He had his own ideas of what would&#13;
work. He made his own understandings with our member governments in terms of what their&#13;
work programs were going to be and how much money they were likely to receive and--but at&#13;
the same time, his logic was really very good in terms of what was priority and what was not,&#13;
and he was a very good critic of the contents of Bank work.&#13;
&#13;
And that was the way we did business in the early '80s. In the early '80s, we--the Bank was&#13;
largely an engineer-dominated institution and financial analysts were second fiddle, but not very&#13;
far back. And in effect what we did was we dealt a lot with the facts, and what we were doing&#13;
was primarily investment projects. We were careful that the investment projects we did had a&#13;
developmental impact, and we were asked to talk about that as, you know, part of the rationale&#13;
for Bank involvement in a project. But a lot of what we did was tangible. You could touch it;&#13;
you could feel it. There were people who were out there building it. So that was an important&#13;
thing.&#13;
&#13;
By the time we got to the mid-'90s, the economists were in charge. We did a lot more structural&#13;
adjustment lending, a lot more policy-based stuff, and it wasn't as tangible as what we did in the&#13;
early '80s.&#13;
&#13;
I don't know which is better in terms of developmental impact, but I am pretty certain that Ernie&#13;
was a lot better at dealing with stuff you could touch and feel than he was with stuff that was&#13;
intuitive in nature.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing, though, is that in the early '80s there was--it was a very different atmosphere.&#13;
You worked for individuals. You knew who your division chief was. You knew who your&#13;
director was. You knew who your vice president was. But your loyalty was to the Bank, to the&#13;
institution. Your bosses might change, but the Bank remained the constant. You might change&#13;
in terms of the assignment you took, but the Bank was still a constant. And those of us who were&#13;
here and doing reasonably well at the time loved the institution. We thought we understood its&#13;
mission, and over time, we realized that a lot of us were conflicted between the developmental&#13;
and banking objectives. But still, the work that we were doing had a lot of meaning, and, you&#13;
know, we felt that we could make an impact on people's lives, and it was people who needed it.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: We'll get into Bank culture a little bit farther on--this is very good ..&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: But let me just bring this to a conclusion.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: What happened in '87, okay-you know, on one day you were fired, and then you&#13;
were selected back in by an individual, you then became part of an individual's network. The&#13;
Bank may have been there in the background, but you owed your loyalty to a person.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Almost feudalism, in a way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                        5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: Yeah, exactly. And that's what changed. So Ernie, instead ofbeing the face of this&#13;
 big monolith called "the Bank" to the people who worked for it in the early '80s, now had to deal&#13;
 with a number of feudal lords who were under him and reported to him, and I think his ability to&#13;
 control was a lot less during the '90s. And also the willingness of his vice presidents to come to&#13;
 a common understanding of the direction we were taking was also a lot less than it had been in&#13;
 the early '80s.&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: Okay, very good. Thank you, Jamil.&#13;
&#13;
 You mentioned Mr. Pettigrew and Frank Lamson-Scribner. Were there any other early&#13;
 supervisors or colleagues who stand out in your mind?&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: One other, you know, was also just an outstanding mentor. His name was Peter&#13;
 Ware, just as ..&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: W ..&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: W-A-R-E. Just as John Pettigrew was sanitary engineer and-or sanitation&#13;
 engineer--who was involved in water supply and sewerage, so was Peter. What--where John&#13;
 helped me a lot was in understanding the developmental objective of the Bank. Where Peter&#13;
 helped me a lot was in understanding process and how important it was to fit within a certain&#13;
 framework and make sure that the work you did all fit within that framework.&#13;
&#13;
 One of the things that I learned the hard way--after Peter left and I took over one of his projects,&#13;
 I went outside the process and really got burned. And, you know, after that I really came to&#13;
 appreciate the many things I learned from Peter.&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: Your career in Operations included work in ten countries in South Asia and East&#13;
 Asia. Can you relate some of your experiences in these countries and the lessons learned,&#13;
 although bear in mind that we're going to be talking about three specific projects a little later on--&#13;
 the Trombay IV, the Nam Theun project, and the Philippine power sector study? This is a more&#13;
 generalized question.&#13;
&#13;
 SOI'HER: Yeah. Well, first of all, I think that we have to broaden the question because the&#13;
 time during which I worked in those ten countries spans from the late '70s until the mid-1990s.&#13;
 There were a lot of changes in technology, communications, and also the capability of borrower&#13;
 institutions over that period of time.&#13;
&#13;
  But I like to think about it, that in the late '70s when I began working with the Bank, it was in&#13;
. South Asia, a lot of my missions lasted between four and five weeks. And the four or five weeks&#13;
  I really wasn't working myself to the bone; it was a case of you had to literally spend that much&#13;
  time on the spot while the people you were working with dug out the information you needed.&#13;
  You couldn't ask them to come up with the information and then send it to you because there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Jamil Sopher&#13;
                       September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
wasn't a means of sending it to you. The easiest way of communicating across distance was&#13;
telex. Telephones were prohibitively expensive, and they weren't good. So during the time I&#13;
was in South Asia, there was a lot of time on my hands, and while I was doing things that I really&#13;
believed in, there was a limit to how much I could do because (a) I could only be in one place at&#13;
one time, and (b) you know, there was this need to wait in order to get what I needed in order to&#13;
do the job.&#13;
&#13;
During that period, I was one of the first Bank project people to carry a computer with me.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, really?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: And some of those early computers, they were these big Cornpaqs that weighed&#13;
about 30 or 35 pounds and had a built-in cathode ray tube and .the like, and then the next&#13;
generation were these grids that had built-in memory. They were slow, but they allowed me to&#13;
do my spreadsheet analysis on the spot, and that was the big change in the early '80s.&#13;
&#13;
As long as I was in South Asia, okay, my missions averaged four to five weeks, and there was&#13;
really not much of a way to shorten it. I transferred to East Asia in 1985, and almost&#13;
immediately the length of my missions shortened to between three--three weeks a year was still&#13;
pretty small, but I almost never was away for more than four weeks at a time.&#13;
&#13;
Two differences were manifest very quickly. First, the quality of telephone communication--!&#13;
could do a certain amount of my interaction with the borrower by phone. Even though there&#13;
wasn't a good way to send me the stuff that I was waiting for, I could prepare for my mission at&#13;
horne, I could ask the borrower by phone to prepare certain things, and the amount of waiting&#13;
time got cut down very substantially. The other thing was that, you know, my own technology&#13;
improved, and there were people on the other end with the capacity to receive my technology.&#13;
&#13;
As a financial analyst, one of the things I needed to do was to develop a financial model for each&#13;
of my eight borrowers so what we'd then be able to do was track--you know, if certain decisions&#13;
were: made, what was the likely outcome of those decisions and what would be the financial&#13;
impact of those decisions. When I was in South Asia, the people I was working with really&#13;
didn't have an appreciation for the power of these models and what these models would do for&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now you are talking about the borrowers, the clients?&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: I'm talking about the clients.&#13;
&#13;
So my building of these models was mainly for the Bank's audience and for insertion into&#13;
appraisal reports or supervision reports. When I moved to East Asia, to them modeling was still&#13;
new because they didn't really have computers to a great degree in '85, '86, '87, but as they&#13;
acquired computers, they took over the modeling function. They carne to understand what was&#13;
the benefit of it. There were people at the borrower organizations that were very interested in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
this approach, and they did it themselves, and by, you know, the late 1980s, early 1990s, I was&#13;
getting my models from them; I didn't have to sit down and build them. So ...&#13;
&#13;
Now, by 1996-1997, which was the end of my time in Operations as somebody who was actually&#13;
doing lending, my missions were down to three weeks on average. I could do about three of&#13;
them a year and pretty well get away with that. And what that meant was that, you know, instead&#13;
of traveling 150 days a year as I had in my early days in South Asia, I was now traveling about&#13;
75 days a year, which was good because, you know, I had kids that I wanted to spend time with.&#13;
And, you know, I always found that if.-you know, by then e-mail had come into play; my&#13;
borrowers had e-mail; by then FAXes came into play. We could exchange a great deal of&#13;
information. And I was always looking for ways of being able to automate the stuff that I did so&#13;
that I didn't have to travel more than was absolutely necessary.&#13;
&#13;
Those were among the differences.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Your CV notes that during your career in Operations from 1978 to 1997, your&#13;
portfolio of25 project loans included water supply and sewerage, port expansion, electric power,&#13;
rural electrification, telecommunications, fuel reformulation, and development finance. How did&#13;
you manage to be active in so many sectors of Bank lending?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, you know, first of all remember I was a financial analyst. The work that you&#13;
do as a financial analyst is not specific to a given type of technology. In economics--sorry, let&#13;
me start with engineering. It's pretty obvious that if you're a power engineer, you know, your&#13;
technology allows you to do a certain amount in electricity but it limits your ability to move into&#13;
transport or health, for example.&#13;
&#13;
If you're an economist, there are economic approaches to forecasting demand and also&#13;
forecasting benefits, you know, that are secto.r-specific. And some economists are very rigorous,&#13;
that-- you know, they are comfortable in the sector in which they were schooled but much less so&#13;
moving across sectoral lines.&#13;
&#13;
From my point of view, my only limitation was that it was a waste of any skill that I might have&#13;
ifl worked with non-revenue-producing entities. But once !--once it became a revenue-&#13;
producing entity, you look at a company the same way, whether that company is in electricity&#13;
supply or whether it's in water or whether it's in development banking. Yeah, there are generic&#13;
differences between them, but it's not that--these are not huge differences. And one of the things&#13;
that I learned very early in my pre-Bank career was that if you track the way money is supposed&#13;
to flow through a corporation, you can figure out where it's efficient and where it's not. So, you&#13;
know, even though my basic tool was corporate spreadsheets, my real involvement was with the&#13;
capacity of the companies I was working with.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay, that answers it pretty well, I think.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    8&#13;

You were one ofthe first World Bank staffto make loans to private companies backed by the&#13;
guarantees of their governments. Could you describe the evolution of this type of lending, your&#13;
role in it, and its overall importance to the Bank, bearing in mind that we are going to discuss&#13;
one specific project, the Trombay IV Project, but this again is a general question?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, first of all, let me buy a caveat on this because I don't really know much about&#13;
what the Bank was doing in the '50s and '60s. I do know a lot about what the Bank was doing in&#13;
the '70s, and it was Robert [S.] McNamara who really oriented us as a government-to-&#13;
government institution. By the time I arrived, virtually all the business that we did in South Asia&#13;
and East Asia was where we lent to governments and government agencies.&#13;
&#13;
It was in India and in the power sector that I really came to see that what we were trying to do in&#13;
the electricity sector was consume far too much in terms of resources and if there was a private&#13;
company or two or three that could supplement the provision of power, it would be a lot-it&#13;
would be a real benefit to the overall development program. Combine that with the fact that&#13;
Bombay at that time was a city of about, you know, I guess about 12 to 14 million people in the&#13;
greater Bombay area, and they had chronic power shortages in certain areas. You know,&#13;
anything we could do to regularize the supply of electricity there would have been, you know, a&#13;
blessing. So when there was a private company that had already been doing work in providing&#13;
electric power, the challenge from my point of view was: save it. Make sure that it survived.&#13;
And that went against the flow in the early 1980s.&#13;
&#13;
To me, the clear thing was if you're going to have development you have to mobilize all of the&#13;
effective members of the community. You can't really single out some and say no, that, you&#13;
know, they are no good.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Unless there's a good reason that they are no good.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, you have to have a good reason for mobilizing them and you have to have a&#13;
very good rationale for the Bank being there. I mean, after all, the Bank is the lender of last&#13;
resort. If you have a very, very strong telecommunications company that can go out and raise&#13;
public shares in its own right, raise international borrowings in its own right, why do they need&#13;
the Bank? So, you know, I mean that has to figure into--but in India at the time, that wasn't one&#13;
of the conditions in the marketplace, and, you know, what we could--whatever we could do to&#13;
regularize the supply of electric power and the efficient provision of electricity was important.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In preparing for this interview, you said to me that your best piece of work was a&#13;
$13:5 million loan in 1984 to the Tata Electric Companies oflndia for the Trombay IV Power&#13;
Project, but that no one knows about it. What made this your best piece of work?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, I think the easy answer to that' is that it was the piece of work that I did that&#13;
had the greatest impact, and the impact is being felt 20 years later.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Impact with the borrower or with the Bank or both?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                      9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: No, the greatest impact on the country, on India.&#13;
&#13;
At the time that I did Trombay IV, private companies providing electricity in India were doomed&#13;
to die a slow death under the way the law was written and interpreted. With that project, we&#13;
brought about a government promise to reinterpret the law in a way that private providers could&#13;
surv1ve.&#13;
&#13;
At the time, Tata was the largest private company providing electric power, but there were only&#13;
two others. I mean, it wasn't as though there were a lot-a lot of others. And I believe that 97 or&#13;
96 percent of all electricity provided in India was provided by the government. Today, it is&#13;
something like about 80 to 85 percent of electricity generated in India is private. So, you know,&#13;
this--this loan turned the company, the country around in terms of provision of electric power.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the importance of this is huge for one reason, and that is that the investment in generating&#13;
plants are among the largest investments the government may ever make because generating&#13;
plants themselves can run anywhere between about 60 million dollars at the low end to billions&#13;
of dollars at the high end, the difference among them being capacity and size. So, you know, if&#13;
you've got a lot of private generation of electric power in a country like India, that is all money&#13;
that the government might otherwise have had to invest that it was able to channel into different&#13;
sectors of the economy: health, education, water, urban transport, you name it. But they weren't&#13;
stuck having to sink all this investment into these electricity generating plants.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Did you have trouble or any particular difficulties in getting the Indian Government&#13;
to come around to that point of view?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Massive. It was massively difficult.&#13;
&#13;
Let me take a couple of steps backward. As the title of the project implies, this was the fourth&#13;
loan that the Bank made to Tata, so I wasn't the first. The first one was for some very small&#13;
power stations that experimented with certain types ofhydro generation, and in fact it was really&#13;
the turbines that were different then. I believe this was either late '60s or early '70s. But there&#13;
was an experimental aspect to Trombay I, and there was an experimental aspect to Trombay II--&#13;
that one wasn't hydro, it was thermal. But again, they w:ere trying out new technology that&#13;
governments normally don't like to do and the size of the power plants were minimal.&#13;
&#13;
Trombay III was a large power plant. It was built with Bank support because the greater&#13;
Bombay area was going through a period of extreme shortage. Nobody, you know, in India&#13;
reallly wanted it ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIE:GLER: Electricity shortage?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah, electricity shortage. Nobody on the Indian side really wanted us to be doing&#13;
business with Tata in '77, '78, but they either had to provide electricity to Bombay or they were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
going to have a real problem on their hands. And the Bank responded by not doing anything&#13;
controversial, by not requiring any difficult covenants, and, you know, everything was fine.&#13;
&#13;
When we came on the scene to do Trombay IV, there was nothing experimental about it and the&#13;
government really wasn't crazy about having us there, but [W.] David Hopper, who was our vice&#13;
president at the time, decided that, you know, we ought to get involved with that. And he had&#13;
asked our unit to put together a strong team because he wasn't really sure what issue was that we&#13;
would uncover, but he felt that, you know, if we really pushed the intellectual side of it, we&#13;
might come up with something that would have a greater impact. What he said to me was he&#13;
couldn't see how we could get involved with Tata and not do something that was important.&#13;
&#13;
When I got to Bombay and I really got into the nuts and bolts of both the Electricity Supply Act&#13;
and the finances of an Indian power company, that's when I began to realize that the Act&#13;
condemned them to die a slow death. And in fact, if I just simply looked at it in the context of&#13;
our loan, okay, combined with the previous one, they would be in great shape to be able to pay&#13;
our interest for the first seven years of the loan, but then, for the last eight, they would be up a&#13;
tree because they wouldn't be allowed to retain the cash flow necessary to make the loan&#13;
repayments.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: This is under the provisions of the Indian electricity act?&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: That's correct. Okay. So evidently I was one of the first financial analysts to raise&#13;
this with Tata, even though they'd had a couple of loans previously. And it was at that point that&#13;
Mr. [Khersi M.] Gherda, who was the chief financial officer--G-H-E-R-D-A--Khersi is his first&#13;
name, Khersi Gherda, and I regard him as a real hero in the Indian context--that's when Gherda&#13;
took me out to lunch, and he said, "You know, when we worked with the Bank in the past, it was&#13;
always a very bureaucratic type of thing, but you're asking the type of questions that we were&#13;
hoping that some banker would, and now I'd like to lay out for you just what the situation is."&#13;
And then he did lay it out, and I had understood correctly that the company was doomed to die a&#13;
slow death and that if we wanted to bring about real change in India, it would be because we&#13;
were going to require that the Indian Government allow Tata to accumulate cash under certain&#13;
provisions of the Electricity Supply Act where there were loopholes that had successively been&#13;
closed.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Can I just step back one second?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What condemned it to die a slow death, just briefly?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: The thing that you have in almost any circumstance in electric power where there's a&#13;
local monopoly is that from a regulatory point of view there are costs that a utility can cover and&#13;
there are costs that it can't. Now, beyond the costs that it's allowed to recover, they have the&#13;
right to a certain level of profit. In India, they were allowed only three percent profit; they were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
allowed to cover interest, but they were not allowed to cover debt repayment. Okay. Now, as&#13;
long as depreciation exceeded debt repayment, they were in good shape. The day debt&#13;
repayment became greater than depreciation, then, first, it would cut into profit, and then .finally&#13;
it would yield a deficit. And that's why they were required by law to die a slow death.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the thing that Gherda pointed out to me and that I used in a major way was that the law&#13;
provided that in addition to allowable expenses, a company could be allowed by the government&#13;
to make cash allocations to certain reserves, and that had to be specified by the government. To&#13;
my knowledge, the government had never allowed any particular reserves. I used that loophole&#13;
to ask the government to allow an accumulation of cash into a reserve for debt repayment. Once&#13;
that was there-okay--then the company could accumulate a certain amount of cash as a result of&#13;
deprecation which they could then use to develop new projects, they could retain their full profit&#13;
and still repay the debt. And that might mean, you know, a tariff increase of about half-a-cent&#13;
per kilowatt hour, something very, very small, but it would allow the company to meet its debt&#13;
repayment obligations without having to go broke.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Besides Mr.--did you finish where you were going with this?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay. In addition to Mr. Gherda, who were some ofthe notable personalities both&#13;
on the borrower side and in the Bank with whom you interacted in preparing this project? Given&#13;
the significance, it might be worth exploring.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: All right. The most--the two most important people were David Hopper and a guy&#13;
named Mr. Chinnappa, and I don't remember Chinnappa's first name. [K. M.] Chinnappa was the&#13;
CEO [chief executive officer] of Tata. He had a personal relationship with David and ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He was an old India hand, David Hopper, as I remember.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yes, he was. I mean, he knew Chinnappa very well, and the fact that we were able&#13;
to do business with Tata came about because of the personal relationship between David and Mr.&#13;
Chinnappa.&#13;
&#13;
When I came back, and I, you know, produced the appraisal report that had this real element of&#13;
controversy in it, the Indian Government totally, you know, refused and said, you know, "We're&#13;
not going to change this merely to satisfy you guys," you know, "and besides, who put you in&#13;
business to become the agent for Tata?"&#13;
&#13;
And I did the appraisal in '84, but the loan actually got approved in '85. It sat dormant for a&#13;
while, and, you know, basically within our region, neither the chief of India programs nor the&#13;
director of South Asia projects wanted to touch this thing with a barge pole; to them, this was a&#13;
really loaded piece of dynamite that could--but David Hopper was the one who was interested.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Now, what I didn't know, until he told me later, was that he checked the conditionality that we&#13;
were proposing with Chinnappa and said, "Is this sound?"&#13;
&#13;
And Chinnappa was the one who came back and said, "This is the only way we are going to stay&#13;
alive, and your guys really worked on this very, very closely with our people."&#13;
&#13;
And around Christmas-time of '84, David was in Delhi, and basically he said he was going to&#13;
block the several projects that the government considered to be priority unless they let Trombay&#13;
through. And the government wasn't happy about that, but several weeks later we got word that&#13;
Tata and the government were going to show up for negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Were there any lessons learned as a result of this project and, to your knowledge,&#13;
have they been incorporated into current Bank work?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, it's a hard one to answer. I mean, the thing that I learned out of it is that&#13;
innovation is extremely difficult, and you have to have a vice president or someone of similar&#13;
level really willing to stick his neck out and go toe-to-toe with the government for innovation to&#13;
happen.&#13;
&#13;
I knew at, you know, :from the time I had lunch with Gherda that what we were doing was a&#13;
revolutionary thing that would open up private provision of electricity. I also knew at the time&#13;
that unless it was badly abused by a bad company--and Enron is a case in point, you know--that&#13;
this would be very beneficial for the government because it would free up government resources&#13;
to invest elsewhere. But that was not going to happen in view of ..&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Jamil, before we got interrupted there briefly, we were talking about the lessons&#13;
leamed as a result ofthis Trombay IV Project.&#13;
&#13;
SOF-HER: Yeah. Well, you know, what I was mentioning at the time was that you really need&#13;
som;:body, a high-level Bank official, who is willing to stick his neck way out and take the risk&#13;
with the lending program. I can tell you that, you know, neither the India country program&#13;
division nor the project director was willing to risk it, and they were quite content to let this&#13;
project, despite its potential to have an impact, die a peaceful death because, you know, they saw&#13;
that, you know, their bread was buttered on the side of generating some, you know, large lending&#13;
volumes.&#13;
&#13;
One thing you should know is that at the time India was promised a certain amount of money per&#13;
year, and it didn't matter what projects we did, so we always prepared more projects than we&#13;
actually did, and it was India that chose which ones they wanted to bring to closure. So as long&#13;
as we didn't have something that really risked the portfolio, you know, nobody wanted to get&#13;
tough with India. David Hopper understood that this was potentially a very major.project, and he&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
was willing to stick his neck out on it, and without that you're not going to bring about tough&#13;
reform in a given country.&#13;
&#13;
I also learned a personal lesson, and it was an important one that has stayed in the back of my&#13;
mind ever since, and that was that sometimes in the Bank you wind up getting no credit at all for&#13;
a really good piece of work. Sometimes that good piece of work is a non-event. When we&#13;
closed the Tata loan, okay, I don't even think there was a press release--there may have been, but&#13;
it was not widely distributed, and I certainly didn't receive a copy of it--and it was treated as a&#13;
non-event, but, you know, the impact that it had over the years was real. I did a lot of lesser&#13;
loans, that--including some that, you know, I didn't think much of--but they got me a lot more&#13;
credit than this. And so, you know, I learned that if you are being given a lot of credit for a&#13;
mediocre piece of work, take it because, you know, the credit for a really good one may not&#13;
materialize.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
 I'm going to switch to the Philippine power sector study. In the early 1990s, the Philippine&#13;
 Government successfully established a working collaboration between private and public&#13;
 interests in supplying the nation's electricity needs in a timely fashion. It was able to deal with a&#13;
 crippling power shortage in 1992 and 1993 through bold measures involving broad-based policy&#13;
 reforms and innovative arrangements with private power producers. At the request of the&#13;
 Philippine Government, the World Bank undertook an assessment of the country's experience&#13;
 with this collaborative process in 1993 and 1994. You led a team of Bank staff and consultants&#13;
 that produced a report of that study. The study made a number of recommendations for further&#13;
 adjustments in the policy and institutional environment to ensure the orderly and efficient&#13;
 development of the power sector into the future and for private development to become self-&#13;
,sustaining.&#13;
&#13;
The press release prepared by the World Bank resident mission in the Philippines on January 18,&#13;
1995, noted: "These recommendations are in line with the government's program enumerated in&#13;
its Energy Sector Action Plan. The Philippines experience has been hailed as one of the few&#13;
successful exercises in the privatization of power generation throughout the developing world in&#13;
recent years, and the government's goal for the future development of the sector, which aims to&#13;
meet all future capacity requirements in collaboration with private developers and private capital,&#13;
is strongly supported by the World Bank." End of quote.&#13;
&#13;
Please describe the events that led up to this mission, some of your experiences during the&#13;
mission, and the results of the mission, including the recommendations contained in its report.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
S01t&gt;HER: Chuck, let me-let me correct one point that was made in your preamble to this&#13;
question. Yes, the Philippine Government did request this study, but they really didn't want it,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and they sent in the request because the Bank pushed them to do it after it became very clear that&#13;
the Bank was going to go out and do it.&#13;
&#13;
Now, what was the origin of this study? We have to really go back a number of years before&#13;
that. In 1981, the Bank did a distribution loan to the National Power Corporation in the&#13;
Philippines. At that point it became clear that the government was getting itself into real trouble&#13;
with the Philippine nuclear plant in Bataan and that they were probably going to come to the&#13;
World Bank to develop a loan to build this plant. The Bank wanted no part of it. People who&#13;
had been involved in the power sector in the Philippines understood the levels of corruption that&#13;
were going on, and ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which were high, I take it.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Very high, yeah. And there was essentially a rupture of relations between the Bank&#13;
and the government and the power sector at the time, number one, and number two, this rupture&#13;
pervaded the overall relationship between the Bank and the [Ferdinand] Marcos government.&#13;
&#13;
This turned out to have been very fortunate for us. When [Corazon] Aquino threw out Marcos as&#13;
a result of "people power" in '86, the Asian Development Bank had been really tarnished as a&#13;
result of their continued collaboration in the power sector and the massive evidence of fraud and&#13;
corruption that had pervaded during the period from '81 to '86.&#13;
&#13;
In contrast, because we hadn't been there--we refused to be there; we had cited the nuclear plant&#13;
as being a, you know, corrupt project-you know, the Bank was welcomed back with open arms.&#13;
And, you know, the old guard ofthen at National Power didn't really want to see us, but they&#13;
were told that they had to by the Aquino Government, and by about '89 there was so much for us&#13;
to do in Philippine power, we had two teams. I headed one .team which was focused on&#13;
distribution and the private sector, the private providers of power, and there was another team&#13;
that was headed by a very, very close friend and a dear friend, Claudio Fernandez, and that was&#13;
the group that was doing lending to National Power. At that time, National Power was this huge&#13;
monopoly, and all of the distribution in the Philippines was handled by either cooperatives or&#13;
private companies, so--and there was a real need for investment at both levels.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time as we had split into two separate teams, IFC [International Finance&#13;
Corporation] was also doing a lot of investing in private development of generation. The private&#13;
companies I was working with were almost entirely involved in distribution.&#13;
&#13;
By 19--well, okay, one other factor. In 1990 there were power blackouts that began and that&#13;
were pretty rampant in the country. And essentially the main island ofLuzan had power&#13;
brownouts of somewhere on the order of about eight hours a day, and these were rolling&#13;
brovmouts throughout the island and throughout the metro Manila area; virtually nobody was&#13;
span~d. Traffic jams were monumental. I mean, it was really pretty awful trying to get around&#13;
Manila and trying to exist in Manila in that period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What happened, as I'm sure is really expected if one thinks about it, is that we had these three&#13;
teams approaching what turned out to be a really massive set of problems, and we were all telling&#13;
the government different things. And it was different things in the interest of our projects, and&#13;
you know, in the long run we were putting out a lot of stuff, but this now became a very difficult&#13;
problem within the Bank because who knew what to believe? Claudio and I loved each other&#13;
dearly, but we were saying things that were very, very dramatically different in terms of what the&#13;
priorities were, in terms of what was affordable, in terms of what tariffs ought to be, you know--&#13;
this sort of thing. And then we had IFC coming in that was giving still more radical stories.&#13;
&#13;
So, the--when this sector study was put together, it was because Claudio and I went to our new&#13;
division chief and we said to him, "This can't continue. We have to get on the same wavelength.&#13;
We have to get on the same page." And he designed this as a piece of economic ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Who was the division chief?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: His name was VineetNayyar, V-I-N-E-E-TN-A-Y-Y-A-R.                  A fabulous division&#13;
chief and real, real good person.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, we went in and we said, you know, "We've got to do something because we've got to&#13;
get on the same page." And of course, you know, first of all I should mention about Claudio. He&#13;
was about four years older than me, Colombian, and what we didn't know until we first really&#13;
began working on the study, we had both been at Cornell at the same time. He was a master's&#13;
student in electrical engineering when I was a bachelor's student, undergraduate in electrical&#13;
engineering. Our paths could have crossed; we would never have known it.&#13;
&#13;
In any event, I was absolutely convinced that, "Give me this assignment, and I'll bring Claudio&#13;
onto the same page as me. I'm charming, I'm good, I'm a great salesman."&#13;
&#13;
Claudio's thinking at the time was, "Give me this assignment, and I'll bring Jamil onto the same&#13;
page," because ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The same reasons.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yes. In any event, that was the rationale for doing this study, and the one piece that&#13;
we were instructed--and this was one of the few times that I have actually been instructed before&#13;
doing a piece of work--we had to spend time with IFC and listen closely to them because they&#13;
had a point of view that, you know, was part of the Bank and it had to be respected.&#13;
&#13;
My position in terms of how we developed the sector had to be-you know, because I was&#13;
dealing with a number of private companies--necessarily had to be closer to IFC's than Claudio's.&#13;
In fact, the way it lined up, I sort of came in the middle.&#13;
&#13;
We did the scoping mission. We did the main mission. The two of us were co-chairs or co-task&#13;
managers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: All right. We took the scoping mission, and I believe that one was either in late '92&#13;
or early '93, and then we took the main mission in the spring of 1993--sorry--the fall of 1993.&#13;
And by any account, it was a disaster. We were talking past each other, and there was just no&#13;
meeting of the minds.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Do you mean you and Claudio?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Me and Claudio, and IFC was, you know, a loose cannon, that was, you know--any&#13;
slight effort we might make to come close together, okay, IFC would come in and with a position&#13;
that was more extreme than mine, it would upset the apple cart.&#13;
&#13;
I took it upon myself to do the white cover [report] and yellow cover [report] write-up, and I&#13;
have never been through a yellow cover meeting that was as much of a disaster as that was. The&#13;
fortunate thing was that what was Claudio's focus was not mine and what was my focus was not&#13;
his, so these positions were reconcilable if only we could, you know, rid ourselves of the dogma&#13;
that had taken place.&#13;
&#13;
Two things then happened, and both of them had a profound impact on me as a human being.&#13;
&#13;
The first one was that there was an ice storm here in Washington. I was away on mission at the&#13;
time,, but Claudio fell and broke his leg--it was a huge hip break--and he was in the hospital for a&#13;
couple of months. And a lot of the work that we had done in trying to pull that first draft&#13;
together-you know, I would essentially leave my office and go to his hospital room and we&#13;
would work there. And so what happened was that there was a very real personal&#13;
rapprochement. He and I had been friends, but the intensity of our friendship really became&#13;
much greater as a result of our working together during his hospitalization.&#13;
&#13;
The second was that Claudio, still in massive pain, took a mission to the Philippines in June and&#13;
got killed in automobile accident.&#13;
&#13;
Now, we had done the yellow cover review in May before he had been killed and-I mean, as I&#13;
said, it was a really disastrous yellow cover meeting. At that point, Vineet decided that, "Well,&#13;
let Jamil be the one to, because he can write, so let him deal with this."&#13;
&#13;
And I went into the lead economist for our department, and he said, you know, "Can you fix this&#13;
thing? Do you want me to kill this?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "No. I can fix it. I know how to do it."&#13;
&#13;
I was struggling a bit because, you know, it was almost as though page-by-page everything had&#13;
to be negotiated. Then Claudio went on mission and got killed, and so, you know, from my point&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of view there was the professional thing that I now no longer had to negotiate this, but on the&#13;
other hand I had lost my closest friend in the Bank. And I mean I still think a lot about Claudio&#13;
because of his, you know, wonderful personal qualities and also his wonderful professional&#13;
qualities. He remains, you know, 12 years later, a role model for me in a major way.&#13;
&#13;
But coming to closure on the report became easy because at that point we could shed the dogma.&#13;
And it was sort of interesting because I really believe that the report was very true to a lot of&#13;
Claudio's deepest convictions, okay, and it was also true to mine because I had managed to find&#13;
ways of satisfying his interests posthumously, okay, as well as mine on an ongoing basis.&#13;
&#13;
Now, what were the--and IFC came on board. IFC was no longer difficult because I was staying&#13;
away from the emotive language that was--so from the point of view of the Bank it was really,&#13;
you know, a case of where a report is able to bring together disparate elements in a way that is&#13;
really good for the institution.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You mention "emotive" elements. Were there things that were said in the report&#13;
that got IFC all flustered?&#13;
&#13;
SOP'HER: That's correct, yeah. You'll understand that in a minute when I get to that.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the rationale that we normally use for doing ESW [Economic and Sector Work] in the&#13;
Banlc is that it should have policy content that helps the government. This was one of the few&#13;
pieces ofESW where we did it for purely internal Bank reasons, because we needed to come&#13;
together. And I think that the Bank ought to do more of that sort of thing, because I really do&#13;
thinlc that every so often Bank staff need to come to grips with, you know, the way they are&#13;
diverging and, you know, need to come together.&#13;
&#13;
Now, what were the two main things that came out of that study?&#13;
&#13;
The first one was that because of the degree to which the government was signing up private&#13;
power providers, we ran the risk of going from a situation of chronic shortage, with 8-hour-a-day&#13;
rolling brownouts, to a situation of massive oversupply. In any power system, Chuck, you like to&#13;
have oversupply of about 30 percent or 40 percent--50 is a little much because it ties up&#13;
investment, but it ain't bad. But when you have 100 percent oversupply and a lot ofthat&#13;
oversupply is being built on the strength oftake-or-pay contracts, okay, I mean, that is a way of,&#13;
you know, taking the government out of the investment business and putting them in the pay&#13;
business and, you know--so that isn't very good. Now, IFC was backing a number of these&#13;
providers, you know, and insisting on take-or-pay contracts, and so of course that was something&#13;
that was an anathema, a conclusion that was an anathema to them. But, you know, it's difficult&#13;
even for IFC to say that oversupply is a good thing. So, you know, the way we wrote that was&#13;
very carefully crafted so that we wouldn't offend them, but we still left the oversupply&#13;
conclusion in the document.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18,2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The second thing was that the finances of the sector were unsustainable, and they were&#13;
unsustainable for two reasons. The first one was that the cost of transmission was too high, and&#13;
the second was that at the generation level you had too many small generating companies that&#13;
didn't have a critical mass of consumers that had the ability to pay. So what wound up&#13;
happening was that in some provinces you had the consumers who-you know, more than 90&#13;
percent of consumers were taking the minimum amount for the minimum payment, some of&#13;
them not even making the payment. And, you know, you just can't run a power company this&#13;
way.&#13;
&#13;
And one of the things that I discovered in doing the research for this was that the government&#13;
had always been very easy with us in saying, "Okay, you want to raise power rates. Fine. We'll&#13;
raise it by 10 percent." But, you know, they never raised the minimum rate. They always were&#13;
raising the second block and the third, and nobody was paying it--or at least the people that they&#13;
were scared of in terms ofvotes weren't paying it. So, you know, this was a chronic situation.&#13;
The only way that I could see resolving it was to have consolidation of a lot of the distribution&#13;
companies into one so that you could shed overhead. And the other one was that there had to be&#13;
an aggressive approach to dealing with inefficiency.&#13;
&#13;
Now, IFC had no difficulty with my conclusions. They weren't terribly happy at the prospect of,&#13;
you know, shrinking the number of private distributors because theologically they, you know,&#13;
believe in more private involvement is better. But, you know, they understood--when I was able&#13;
to lay it out as good analysis, they understood.&#13;
&#13;
So, you know, the green cover report was a triumph, and Bill [William A.] McCleary, the lead&#13;
economist who had told me that if I wanted to kill it he was willing to help me, he decided to&#13;
take me out to a big, expensive lunch because, you know, he was just amazed that this&#13;
turnaround was possible.&#13;
&#13;
Now, why do I list this among my high-impact pieces of work? Because the government never&#13;
followed the critical pieces of advice. By 1998, when the peso dropped through the floor--and it&#13;
went from about 24 to the dollar to about 48 to the dollar; it's moved back, I think, to about 44 or&#13;
45, something in that range--they were awash in excess capacity. Claudio's prediction of&#13;
oversupply was right on target, on the mark. It couldn't have been, you know, it couldn't been&#13;
better than that. And the financial problems exacerbated it. Now, because of the currency crisis&#13;
they had two or three--I don't remember exactly how many--price increases very fast, and they&#13;
found no additional revenue in peso terms, which bore out the conclusion that I had come to in&#13;
terms of the financial analysis.&#13;
&#13;
So the upshot of it is that very little was done, and ten years later friends from the Philippines are&#13;
telling me that that is still timely and that they really do need to follow the Bank's advice as laid&#13;
out in that report.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And it still hasn't been done, to your knowledge?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: The consolidations at the distribution level have not happened, and quality of supply&#13;
is still poor, it's unreliable, and you've got these co-ops, one more bankrupt than the next, who&#13;
are hanging on on the basis of very cheap government loans. And, you know, that can't last&#13;
indefinitely.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the Bank's lending program is very weak at this point, in large part because, you know, the&#13;
financial problems facing the country have gone unaddressed and the biggest one is the losses in&#13;
the electric power industry.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Plus political problems. The current President has just barely escaped&#13;
impeachment, apparently.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah. But the thing is that the Bank would find a way of dealing with them if they&#13;
had been taking our advice on a regular basis and the financial situation was in better shape than&#13;
it is.&#13;
&#13;
Chuck, as a slight digression, okay, I want to tell you about one experience that I had in&#13;
Philippine power, because this is what people working on projects confront. Now, they don't&#13;
confront this every day, but once in a career, you know ...&#13;
&#13;
I had been working--this was after the release of my sector study, which didn't make too many&#13;
people happy, but ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: This is this Philippine power sector study?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah, yeah. It didn't make too many people happy in the Philippines because it was&#13;
tough medicine that we were recommending. I think we recommended it pretty kindly, and my&#13;
ability to work with the Filipinos was not adversely affected so.&#13;
&#13;
But I arrived in Manila in early 1995. I was working on a transmission project with a New&#13;
Zealand engineer named John Irving. John also became a very good friend over time. And we&#13;
were invited into the office of the president ofNational Power. He sat us down, and he said,&#13;
"You know, we have a real problem here, and we would really appreciate the Bank's support."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What is the problem?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, you know, we have this power station in southern Luzan which was supposed to&#13;
come on stream in late '93, and now we are ready to have it come on stream, and, you know, it's&#13;
been built and it's fine."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, that doesn't sound like a problem."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, the problem is this. With Japanese financing, we built this transmission line, and&#13;
it was ready in late '93. And now that the power plant is almost finished, we decided to see what&#13;
we could do about energizing the line, and we figured out that somebody stole it."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Somebody stole the transmission line?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Yeah."&#13;
&#13;
"How do you steal a transmission line?" I mean, on this transmission line, there are 7 wires that&#13;
run, you know, 500 kildmeters each. I mean, how do you steal3500 kilometers of cable?&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, they did it."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Okay. I'll tell you what. Within the next couple of days, let me use the National Power&#13;
helicopter. I want to over fly this line. I want to see what you mean by it's been stolen."&#13;
&#13;
Amazingly, John and I flew the length of the line and back, and that line had literally been&#13;
stolen. And the people who did the stealing were really pretty artful. In some cases they left the&#13;
non-conducting core and unwound the aluminum. And a lot of this is mountainous terrain. Your&#13;
son will tell you that the terrain is not very easy between Manila and Bicol. And, you know,&#13;
somehow--so they must have had inside help because how do you unwind 3500 kilometers of&#13;
cable?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And they left the towers and ..&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: The towers were fine, and for miles on end the core was still there; There was just&#13;
no conducting wire.&#13;
&#13;
So anyway, I mean, you know, when you ask yourself what are we up against in terms of&#13;
governance issues and the like, I mean, you know, this is--this is a tough environment within&#13;
which we work. And it's-it's not hard to understand why sometimes they don't take our advice.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So what did you finally do about that?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, what was interesting was that this was the one real disagreement between John&#13;
and me. John wanted to fold this into the project. I went first to Gautam [S.] Kaji, who was my&#13;
vice president and then later was Managing Director, and I said, "No way Jose. We cannot be&#13;
seen to be financing corruption." And this was before Jim [James D.] Wolfensohn decided that,&#13;
you know, corruption was the sort of thing we could talk about.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay. Well, that's an interesting story. Anything else you want to say about the&#13;
Philippines before we switch to Laos?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, there was--at the risk of a couple of minutes?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: There was one other project that was extremely interesting, and that was the&#13;
telecommunications project.&#13;
&#13;
In 1990, the Philippines approached us--they were the ones who made the approach--and they&#13;
said, you know, "We cannot get Philippine Long-Distance Telephone Company to invest. The&#13;
only thing we can figure is maybe you can find a way of making a loan so that you can bring&#13;
your conditionality into it." And the government was going to-was thinking about launching a&#13;
competing network, so that that way maybe we could channel the loan to the government's&#13;
competing network.&#13;
&#13;
At the time, the saying that was floating around Manila was, you know, 98 percent of the country&#13;
is waiting for a phone and the other 2 percent are waiting for a dial tone. So, I mean that was the&#13;
state of affairs.&#13;
&#13;
But Philippine Long-Distance Power was a-sorry, PLDT, Philippine Long-Distance Telephone-&#13;
-was a powerful company that had its shares listed on the American Stock Exchange and that&#13;
had, you know, quite a bit of access to capital, so, you know, we approached it very gingerly.&#13;
&#13;
What we found was that it was a nonstarter to think we could lend to the government's alternate&#13;
network. That was never going to get built. It was a nice idea but just too costly, and there was&#13;
nobody there who could really execute such a thing.&#13;
&#13;
So we made the recommendation that what we should do is to lend to PLDT. Interesting. PLDT&#13;
was having difficulty because the Philippines in general was having difficulty raising money, so&#13;
they were very gracious about talking to us and about getting into business with us, and they&#13;
were very happy to do it. From about 1990 through the end of 1991, we spent our time&#13;
developing this loan and appraised it, and then, finally, we decided, you know, to bring it to the&#13;
yellow cover stage. And at that point, it all seemed pretty good. The conditionality we put&#13;
together was sound. Kaji really liked it, and so did Inder [K.] Sud, who was our division chief.&#13;
&#13;
And then an event happened that--again, the lesson in this for somebody working at the Bank is&#13;
huge. The division chief in charge of the Legal Division that served East Asia got promoted. In&#13;
his place carne somebody who had a very different philosophy toward the way we worked.&#13;
Immediately, the lawyer who was working with us was replaced, and now we had hostility&#13;
within the Legal Department toward this loan. We thought we had corrected the things that they&#13;
didn't like, although, you know, it was quite a pill to swallow that you bring a loan to a certain&#13;
level and then suddenly a lot changes.&#13;
&#13;
And then we invited PLDT to come to negotiations along with the government, and right there&#13;
Legal busted the negotiations. You know, they wouldn't let it continue on the basis that we had&#13;
set up. Now, there were some, you know, pretty complicated financial issues. It was, you know,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
how do you mobilize the guarantee ofthe government for a loan to the private sector. The&#13;
private company was a company that was, you know, very powerful and very rich, so did we&#13;
need a 20-year term? The government wanted a 12-year term, but then they would repay us in&#13;
20. I mean, there were some thorny issues, and Legal simply didn't like it.&#13;
&#13;
We made the point that we did not want to work with the lawyer that had been assigned to us.&#13;
So, magnanimously, the Legal Department decided to assign still another lawyer, and you know&#13;
who that other lawyer is. It's a gentleman named Tariq [A.] Hassan, who was on our [Staff&#13;
Association] Executive Committee, very, very decent guy, very decent human being.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: No, I don't think I was on with him. It was probably a different Executive&#13;
Committee.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: You weren't. He was-he was on for part of my second year and then after I&#13;
finished.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yeah. I wasn't on it then. What was his last name?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Hassan, H-A-S-S-A-N.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay, Tariq Hassan.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Tariq. You know, one of the things that I really appreciated about Tariq was that he&#13;
was a gentleman, a real fine quality gentleman. You could have a real spitting argument with&#13;
him, and the gentleman within him has never left. And I really liked him. He went back to&#13;
Pakistan and has been very successful in the current government, and I wish him all the best&#13;
because ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He '11 need it.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: You know, the gentleman in this man was something I still find remarkable.&#13;
&#13;
Anyhow, he goes to the Philippines, spends about four weeks there to rework this loan, comes&#13;
back with a package that's virtually identical to the one we started with, and then Legal approves&#13;
it and we conclude negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
But that put us off-track by three months. Instead of going to the Board in June, we go to the&#13;
Board in mid-September. What happened? Two days before we take the loan to the Board,&#13;
PLDT announces a $200 million loan, bond issue, on the American Stock Exchange. We nearly&#13;
got killed. I mean, you know, the Board could not have been more hostile. The U.S. chair was&#13;
almost tearful in his condemnation of the project. I mean, you know, basically his idea was:&#13;
how can we do this?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Do you remember who that was?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: I remember ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: [E. Patrick] Coady, maybe?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Coady, Pat Coady, a good guy. I mean, I talked to him a lot after that, and we&#13;
became friendly after that because, in fairness to him, he recognized this wasn't our fault. You&#13;
know, we were the guys on the firing line doing the work. But, you know, he just--he said, "If&#13;
this-if we can't stop a loan like this where the borrower clearly doesn't need it, okay, what can&#13;
we stop?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, I remember now.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: And I got to know David Peretz when he became an advisor to Jim Wolfensohn, and&#13;
he used to come to Corporate Day. Once, we were at the same table at Corporate Day, and he&#13;
said to me, he said, "I've seen you before."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Yes, I'm the guy who presented the PLDT loan to the Board when you were sitting&#13;
on the Board."&#13;
&#13;
And then, after a very long silence, he looked at me and said, "That was not your finest&#13;
moment," you know, "That was not your finest hour." And then, after another pause, he said,&#13;
"That wasn't even your finest three hours" because that's how long they--but I was not the task&#13;
manager for that; I was the number two, but I was asked to make the Board presentation and&#13;
field the questions.&#13;
&#13;
I remember coming out of the Board that day, and it was approved, and Vineet Nayyar, who was&#13;
still my division chief, came to me, and he said, "Well, Dr. J, okay, what did you learn from this&#13;
experience?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "When you go to the Board, pee first."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: But they actually approved the loan, even after all that?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: They approved the loan, and--but, you know, there was the strong suspicion that we&#13;
were never going to do another telecom loan. It took about two and a half or three years for us to&#13;
do another one.&#13;
&#13;
But the point is that, you know, I see that there is a need somewhere in the system for the Bank&#13;
to decide that it has made a mistake, even at the last minute. When PLDT went out with this&#13;
bond issue, it removed all of the rationale for our being involved. The other thing about the&#13;
PLDT loan was that there has to be a mechanism within the Bank for there to be continuity from&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
.ZIEGLER: For our last segment this afternoon, Jamil, we'll move on to the Nam Theun II&#13;
 Project in Laos.&#13;
&#13;
In 1988, the Lao PDR Government decided to develop its first large hydro venture for supplying&#13;
bulk electricity to Thailand at Nam Theun II. This project generated a great deal of controversy,&#13;
especially with environmental groups, and had a long gestation period. Indeed, the Bank&#13;
officially gave its support to the project only on March 31 of this year. I understand that you&#13;
were involved in some of the early stages ofBank consideration ofthis project. How did your&#13;
involvement come about?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: All right. Let me again correct the record slightly. It is a fact that Nam Theun&#13;
became the project that we were going to work on in 1988, but our work on Nam Theun or an&#13;
alternative actually began in late 1985.&#13;
&#13;
Now, let me spend a couple of minutes going back to the very early days of all of this. I made&#13;
my first visit to Laos in November and December of 1985. At that time, I was to be task&#13;
manager of a project under development called the Seven Provinces Electrification Project. It&#13;
was a distribution project to connect up to, actually, the Thai power grid a number of cities in&#13;
southern Laos that had no other alternative for grid supplied electricity.&#13;
&#13;
Now, what that meant was that some of them did have their own generators, some people in&#13;
those areas had batteries that they could use to electrify, but, you know, it wasn't the type of&#13;
electricity that could stimulate commerce. And there were already existing towns and villages&#13;
that did have good commercial bases, so, you know, electricity in those cases would be engines&#13;
to growth.&#13;
&#13;
At the time, there had been a power station named Nam Ngum, N-G-U-M, and Nam Ngum had&#13;
been built free to the Lao with the help of a number of the allied governments that had been&#13;
involved in the Vietnam War. So there was a hydro station, the cost of generating hydro is next&#13;
to nothing-you know, operating cost--and the cost of building it, which is usually the&#13;
prohibitive aspect of hydro, cost them nothing. They weren't paying interest or debt service to&#13;
speak of for Nam Ngum. Needless to say, they provided electricity supply in the Vientiane area&#13;
free-no, not really free, but it was just so inexpensive that it might as well be free--and they&#13;
were exporting about 90 percent of the output ofNam Ngum to Thailand.&#13;
&#13;
It was fairly easy to see, based on the projections we were able to come to, that they would soon&#13;
get to 50-50, and that actually happened byÂ· about 1991.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: 50-50 in terms of the electricity distribution to Thailand and Laos, you mean?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: And it wasn't all of Laos. It was just simply electricity distribution within the&#13;
Vientiane area.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the principle was that when we connected up the three cities in the south--or villages,&#13;
really, in the south--it would be a swap. The electricity would be acquired from Thailand as an&#13;
even swap for a certain amount of electricity that was imported by Thailand from Nam Ngum.&#13;
So, you know, it was a nice arrangement that was possible.&#13;
&#13;
Now, during the course of that mission where I did the preparation of the Southern Provinces&#13;
Project, I also discussed with the Government at length a scheme that had been pushed by the&#13;
Mekong Commission based in Bangkok to develop a hydro-a larger hydro facility that would&#13;
export electricity from Laos to Thailand. The demand was present in Thailand--it could be done-&#13;
-and there were some very favorable sites in Laos.&#13;
&#13;
On the surface of it, we thought that the one most likely to be selected would be Nam Ngum II.&#13;
The word "nam" means "river," and it was the Ngum River, and it's further upstream from Nam&#13;
Ngum I. And one ofthe other alternatives we were looking at was Nam Theun II, which was on&#13;
the Theun River, the second site in terms of the cascade. And there was real debate within the&#13;
Mekong Committee or Commission as to which was the more favorable of the two sites. We&#13;
also looked at a couple of other sites.&#13;
&#13;
But I became the task manager for the pre-feasibility study that would make the selection. And&#13;
then for all of this to emerge into a project, there would be pre-feasibility study leading to a&#13;
feasibility study-sorry--a pre-feasibility study to select, leading to a pre-feasibility study of the&#13;
project, of the selected project, leading to a feasibility study, leading to the project itself.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the pre-feasibility study to select ended in-it began in 1986 after we had agreed to&#13;
become the executing agency for UNDP [United Nations Development Program] on it. The&#13;
UNDP put up the money, and it became my responsibility. And that pre-feasibility study was&#13;
conducted by an Australian firm named Snowy Mountain, and they wound up selecting Nam&#13;
Theun II, okay.&#13;
&#13;
Then, from 1988 until about 1990, there was the pre-feasibility study for the project. Now, I had&#13;
two epiphanies during that period-! guess, you know, for a Jewish boy, I shouldn't be-but&#13;
anyway. The first one ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He was Jewish, too, you know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: This is true.&#13;
&#13;
The first one was the appreciation of what I saw happening in this country and what I saw&#13;
happening at the Bank, that the environmentalists became a stronger and stronger movement.&#13;
Now,, you probably remember from some of my remarks at the Delegate Assembly that I wasn't&#13;
particularly friendly to environmentalists at the time. But at the sameÂ· time, you know, I had a&#13;
deep conviction that I wasn't here at the Bank to make people miserable, and if we were going to&#13;
devastate the environment of one or the other project area, then we had to build in either&#13;
environmental safeguards or some form of compensation for the people who are going to be&#13;
devastated by this or both, okay.&#13;
&#13;
So I went to Inder Sud, who was the division chief at the time, and I said to him, "Inder, I am not&#13;
going to.do this project unless we really do a good job on environment. We have to build that&#13;
into the pre-feasibility study; we have to discuss with the NGOs [non-governmental&#13;
organizations]; we have to bring them onto our side."&#13;
&#13;
Inder's response was, "I'm not sure what you mean by 'bringing them onto our side,' but I have&#13;
been having the same feelings also."&#13;
&#13;
So what we are looking for in this is not just a hydro project but an environmentally responsible&#13;
way to do a hydro project.&#13;
&#13;
ZIE~GLER:     And this wasn't mere expedience but it was something you actually believed, was ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOP'HER: Yeah, yeah. I mean, the thing was that it was a pain to have to go to this trouble&#13;
when we were rated on our ability to knock out projects, but this is something that I've really&#13;
com~ to appreciate about the Bank. People aren't there because they want to devastate the&#13;
environment. They're there because they really want to do good, and, you know, they are&#13;
willing to learn as they go along that environment is another piece of the puzzle, just as&#13;
resettlement and social issues are different pieces of the puzzle.&#13;
&#13;
So we were among the first-you know, it's always dangerous to say "the first," but we were&#13;
among the first to put a complete Environmental Impact Assessment into a pre-feasibility study&#13;
for a hydro project.                                          Â·&#13;
&#13;
The second epiphany I came to--and one of the reasons I remember this, Chuck, is because it was&#13;
very shortly after I learned WordStar and therefore I had--it was one of the very first memos I&#13;
ever put tog~~ther that was word-processed--but I kept hearing the price tag for this project go up.&#13;
And the pre-feasibility that selected the project was looking at a project that would cost $165&#13;
million, and I tried to count up the money to figure out, you know, where this money was going&#13;
to come from, and then as we got into the feasibility study the 165 became 265, became 350,&#13;
became 500, and then it was becoming 600.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And at that point, you know, we had project divisions in country departments and then there was&#13;
a teclmical department. And the guy who was the chief of the Energy Technical Division was a&#13;
guy named ['~illiam T.] Bill Smith. Bill was a really crusty guy. A lot of people found him&#13;
difficult. In fact, he was fairly difficult with me on some occasions, but I also found him to be&#13;
the kind of      I could              know                       with. I really liked him. And&#13;
                                                                   I really came to admire the man&#13;
tremendously. So as the price kept escalating, I thought, "Okay, I've got to have lunch with Bill&#13;
Smith. I have to talk with him. It doesn't make any sense to talk with Inder Sud because he&#13;
doesn't really understand electricity but he will understand a refined discussion, but the guy I've&#13;
got to work it though with is Bill."&#13;
&#13;
Now, Bill had worked with the Mekong Commission before he came to the Bank, so there was&#13;
this tie. And I said to Bill, I said, "You know, there has to be a price beyond which the&#13;
government cannot afford to do this as a government-run, government-led project, that--you&#13;
know, I don't--probably 165, they can afford. I just don't believe that there is any way that we&#13;
can put together any kind of package where they can afford 600 million. What do you think I&#13;
ought to do, Bill?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, the thing I think you ought to do is put together a think piece, use the number&#13;
300 million as your basis for the think piece, and try to figure out how you can do this thing at&#13;
300 million. And if you conclude that you can't do it as a purely government-owned project if&#13;
it's 300 million, then you can postulate that anything above that, you can't do."&#13;
&#13;
That was really a--a very important part to all of this, because, you know, I used to think that one&#13;
of the things that we had to do as financial analysts was find "the number," and what he was&#13;
saying was, "Pick a safe number and make the presumption that anything above--if you can't do&#13;
it at that safe number, anything above it, you can't do." Okay.&#13;
&#13;
So I did that. It took about a week and a half because I couldn't do this full-time. Ifl had been&#13;
able to do it full-time, I could have knocked this out in about two days. But I put together a 4-&#13;
page: memo which, you know, was very tight, where I basically said if this is over 300 million, it&#13;
can't be done. And what I was looking for was how much credit can Laos get from different&#13;
places. I was only able to come up with about 150 to 160, but I said I am willing to make&#13;
allowances for the possibility that Laos can get supplier credits and they can get other forms of&#13;
low-Â·cost financing for another 100 million, but above that, where are they going to get the&#13;
money from? Okay.&#13;
&#13;
And I circulated that to Inder Sud, he was at the first level, and to the rest of my Nam Theun&#13;
team and, of course, to Bill Smith. Inder came into my office and said, "I don't know whether to&#13;
be pissed off at you or really pleased."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Why?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
He said, "This memo on Laos is a really good piece of work, but they have a communist&#13;
government. How will they ever accept private development, because that is what you are&#13;
effectively saying they have to do because they have no alternative?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, first of all, this pre-feasibility study is going to be finished in about a year, so let's&#13;
not worry about it for now. But let us be thinking along these lines because, you know, we need&#13;
to be the ones who introduce this."&#13;
&#13;
At the risk of another digression, I want to recount a story to you about the first mission I took to&#13;
Laos. Again 1985, when they found out that I was supposed to leave the country--! was the task&#13;
manager for Southern Provinces--when they found out I was supposed to leave the country on&#13;
December 1, they raised a ruckus, and they asked for me to stay until December 3. So I said&#13;
okay.&#13;
&#13;
I found out that the reason for that was because December 2 was Independence Day, and it was&#13;
something like the 12th anniversary of Lao independence from the Boun Oum period. And ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: From which period, sorry?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Prince Boun Oum [Nachampassack], B-0-U-N 0-U-M. He was the guy that the&#13;
U.S. backed during the Vietnam War.&#13;
&#13;
And we--at this time the Prime Minister was a guy named Kaysone Phomvihane, I think, and the&#13;
President, which was a ceremonial position, was held by a guy named Souphanouvong, S-0-U-&#13;
P-H-A-N-0-U-V-0-N-G.&#13;
&#13;
No, I was wrong. Boun Oum was tossed out in about 1970, and from 1970 to about 1976 or&#13;
1974 was Souvanna Phouma. You might remember that as one of the great names from the&#13;
Vietnam War. Or Souvanna Phouma might even have been earlier. It might have been '66. But&#13;
Souvanna Phouma was in power throughout much of the Vietnam War. He was presumably&#13;
neutral, but the communists didn't like him, and Souphanouvong was Souvanna Phouma's&#13;
brother. So ...&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, on the second of December I was led to the stadium, where I was under the hot sun, not&#13;
expecting what happened, with a translator at my side. And Kaysone launches into this speech&#13;
that lasts three hours. And of course, the translator was dutifully translating to me, and most of it&#13;
is about "rurming dog capitalists who are busy bombing our country" and stuff like that--and of&#13;
course, this ils all me.&#13;
&#13;
And so I point this out to give an idea of the level of communism that was afoot in that country.&#13;
I believe that Kaysone retired in 1992 or '93. By the time we had a private developer, Kaysone&#13;
was gone, but--and Souphannouvong either died or relinquished his hold on power in '94 or '95.&#13;
So, you know, there was a transition during that period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Now, the other thing I remember from my first visit was that I was doing business with a vice&#13;
minister at the time--his name will come back to me very shortly--but I was invited to his office,&#13;
and there was this peculiar-looking statue that was in the bookcase, and, you know, my eye kept&#13;
being drawn to this. And finally after our meeting I turned to him and--oh, I am troubled by the&#13;
fact that I don't remember his name at the moment--but I said to him, "Sir, this statue, what is it?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Oh, it's comrade [Vladimir Ilyich] Lenin."&#13;
&#13;
So I said, "\Vhy is he looking into the bookcase instead of out toward the rest of us?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, you know, you're an American, and I didn't want to offend you."&#13;
&#13;
And you know, I mean, that told me a great deal about the Lao because, you know, they were--&#13;
they had, you know, real ideology about communism, and they did think of us as the people who&#13;
did a lot of damage during the war. But it wasn't a personal thing, and they were able to&#13;
transcend and inove on from there. So anyway, you know, that sort of sets the scene.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
Now, this Vice Minister was Mr. Soulivong [Daravong], and he was a very soft-spoken&#13;
gentleman who had been educated in Montreal. I believe he had been to school at McGill, but it&#13;
might be one of the Catholic schools there. In any event, he had an electrical engineer's&#13;
education, and almost immediately after he received his degree he returned to Laos, but not by&#13;
the normal way. He returned by way of Moscow, across Siberia and, you know, and joined the&#13;
forces of Souphanouvong in the jungle.&#13;
&#13;
Soulivong was probably the most urbane and courtly member of the Pathet Lao. I mean, I didn't&#13;
meet all of them, but the ones I met were a lot rougher, a lot more-you know, much less&#13;
cultivated. But Soulivong was really a very refined guy. By 1990 he became the Minister.&#13;
Now, that didn't mean he was a member of the Politburo, but he had real standing within the Lao&#13;
Government. And because of the personal relationship we developed when he was Vice&#13;
Minister, you know, he was willing to interact with me even though his level might have&#13;
precluded it.&#13;
&#13;
And so after I put together this memo for Bank internal purposes, just before I knew Snowy&#13;
Mountain was going to release the overall memo, the overall pre-feasibility study on Nam&#13;
Theun, I dedded to share this internal memo with Soulivong, who could read English very, very&#13;
weli so, I mean, there was no--there wasn't even a language barrier for that.&#13;
&#13;
And we went out to dillller, and Soulivong looked at me, he said, "You know, with your memo,&#13;
you're saying that we have to go private development."&#13;
&#13;
I saild, "Well, are you sure that this is going to be more than $300 million?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Are you sure you're eating rice?"&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, I mean--to a degree, we were being facetious because we both knew that Snowy&#13;
Mountain's figure was going to come in somewhere between 600 and 700 million dollars.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
So he said, you know, "That will never fly with my authorities."&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, the pre-feasibility study was released. We have a big discussion of it among the&#13;
donors. Soullivong, of course, knew where I stood on this thing. And I had made the point that I&#13;
was not going to attend the presentation among the donors if there wouldn't be a separate session&#13;
for N GOs on the environmental impact study.&#13;
&#13;
We have this congress. It goes on. UNDP sponsors the session--sessions. And the project is&#13;
presented first to the donors and then is presented to the NGOs. At the conclusion of the&#13;
presentation to the donors, we made the point, we said, "You know, for work to continue on this&#13;
project, we are going to need somewhere on the order of about $5 to $10 million." And UNDP&#13;
then said that they were willing to put up up to $5 million on a matching basis, and that's the way&#13;
we were going to raise the tally. We were very explicit about what we were going to use the&#13;
money for, I mean, you know, that It could be tied financing, etcetera.&#13;
&#13;
So UNDP says that. How much do you think they raised?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Two hundred million?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Zero.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Zero?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Not one penny. Not one donor turned around and said, you know, "Guys, we're&#13;
willing to putup, you know, $50,000." Not one penny.                       Â·&#13;
&#13;
Now, several members of the Politburo were present at that pledging exercise, so all of a sudden&#13;
their eyes opened. And that night Soulivong and three or four of the ministers were in my hotel&#13;
room, and Soulivong asked me to explain a little bit about private development and how it works&#13;
and that sort of thing. And of course, we were very far from doing anything on that basis, but&#13;
that was the evening that changed the way the Lao were going to do this.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the seeond set of meetings, which were with the environmentalists, were very strange. The&#13;
environmentalists were not at all prepared to have the World Bank, the Lao Government, the&#13;
feasibility consultants--the pre-feasibility study consultants--sit down with them and tell them,&#13;
"This is what's going to happen in this project, and incidentally, guys, there will be devastation&#13;
of about 100 square kilometers of pine forest. That is unavoidable. But this is what we are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
planning to do in order to save more trees than we cut down"--because that was the premise that&#13;
I had put to Snowy Mountain.&#13;
&#13;
And the reaction we got was largely things like, "Well, why do we have to do this dam in the&#13;
first place? \lVhy don't we put up a hotel for ecotourism?"&#13;
&#13;
And of course, our answer was, "Well, you know, how many million dollars of revenue per year&#13;
can you generate off the hotel for ecotourism?"&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, so it was really a surrealistic meeting. At the end of the meeting, the&#13;
environmentalists who were there thanked us for having held the session, and they made the&#13;
point that, you know, there have been very few sessions like this where the World Bank was&#13;
willing to sit with them and talk about these things with them. And one of them--his name was&#13;
Charlie Palmer, P-A-L-M-E-R--I don't remember his nationality--he said to me, he said, "You&#13;
know, if this sort of thing is going to happen in the future, then I have a lot to learn to hold up my&#13;
end of these sorts of discussions, but I'm not really prepared to say anything to you, because I am&#13;
just not used to this kind of discussion."&#13;
&#13;
I mention this because years later when we got private development underway, Charlie Palmer&#13;
was a player also, and there were other players who were a lot more strident. But there was one&#13;
meeting that took place in March 1996 with Jim Wolfensohn, and, you know, I was at that&#13;
meeting, and he was hearing, you know, what an evil group we are because of dams in Chile and&#13;
Paraguay and Guatemala, and then they brought up Nam Theun. And Charlie Palmer spoke up,&#13;
and he said, "You know, I am perhaps the only one here who has actually dealt with the World&#13;
Bank on the Laos project, and I can tell you that my experience has been very different. Your&#13;
people have been very open with us."&#13;
&#13;
So--and the meeting in 1991 was not the first meeting I had with Charlie Palmer. I had several&#13;
others after the fact. But what was very interesting was t h a t - came to that meeting&#13;
and denied it ever took place, and Charlie Palmer, open and above board to Wolfensohn, said,&#13;
"Yes, the 1991 meeting did take place, and yes, you know, your team has been very&#13;
straightforward with us on an ongoing basis."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Although I remember reading later--and you probably weren't involved at this&#13;
point--but some of the NGOs were complaining that these meetings tended to be, maybe some of&#13;
the later meetings tended to be more pro forma and the Bank wasn't really listening and ...&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, you know, that's what they turned to when, you know, when they couldn't&#13;
attack us for not talking to them. Now, you're right that, you know, from late '96 onward I was&#13;
no longer involved ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I'm talking about later than that.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: .. with the projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, what was interesting was that I went back to Laos two or three times in '92, and Narn&#13;
Theun was stalled. Then all of a sudden in '93, I got a call from a guy at Transfield at Australia-&#13;
-it was an Australian contractor--whose name was John McGarry. And I remember John quite&#13;
well, because he was really a very, very decent guy. You know, he and I fought like cats, partly&#13;
in '93, partly in '94, but by '95 we had really come to respect one another.&#13;
&#13;
And Transfield had gone into joint venture with Electricite de France, EDF, to develop Narn&#13;
Theun, and they were signing a memorandum of understanding that would give them the right to&#13;
develop Narn Theun for a period of time. So McGarry wanted to come to Washington and to the&#13;
Bank in order to make a presentation. This was, I think, the fall of '93.&#13;
&#13;
I didn't know what the hell to say. I mean, I was caught completely flat-footed. So I went to&#13;
Vineet Nayyar, and I said, "Look, you know, I have told you a little bit about Narn Theun, but,&#13;
you lmow, nothing has happened on that, so I thought I shouldn't burden you with too much&#13;
about this. 11&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Why do you want to do this thing? The environmentalists hate anything to do with&#13;
hydro. You're just going to complicate your life."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Vineet, we can't dismiss this. Laos is an exceptionally poor country. If they're going to&#13;
survive as a &lt;~ountry, they need something to jurnpstart the economy. And I'm no economist--I&#13;
dori't know beans about these things--but I can tell you that in knowing what I know about Laos,&#13;
they can either export hydroelectricity or trees or lumber. Okay? So which is likely to have a&#13;
better impact on the environment: cutting down teak wholesale, okay, or selling hydropower?" I&#13;
said, you know, "The problem is that when you get a group like Transfield and EDF corning in,&#13;
their governments then take over, and we may even be excluded, in which case you'll be very&#13;
happy but the trees will disappear."&#13;
&#13;
So he said, "All right." He said, "I'm not going to pass judgment one way or the other about this,&#13;
okay, but you better go and see [Callisto E.] Madavo, because if they're corning, then, you know,&#13;
if I were Madavo, I would simply decide not to meet with them."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was he the Vice President then, Callisto Madavo?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Callisto was our director.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, the department director, then.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah. And he said, "You know, if Callisto doesn't sign on, then he's not going to&#13;
meet with them, and that will be the worst of all disasters."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Okay, I'm willing to meet with him." And I said to him, "But I also want to meet with&#13;
one other person. 11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Who is that?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Gautam." Gautam at that time was our vice president.&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, you have a very good contact with him, and you can walk in to him any time is&#13;
my understanding."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Vineet, I'm not walking in on Gautam without you with me. It's a case where--yeah, I&#13;
can use my personal contact, but, you know, this--I can't be a maverick. I have to be somebody&#13;
who will brief you even if you don't buy what I have to say."&#13;
&#13;
And I think he was quite courageous, because Madavo didn't want to see us, and we went first to&#13;
Gautam.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So you went to your vice president before you went to the department director?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, we went. We spoke to Kaji, and Kaji looked at me, and he said, "So, you want to do&#13;
Nam Theun and get every environmentalist on the face of the earth down your back?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What makes you think that?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Because with Pak Mun, I was the one who backed Pak Mun as the director, and I got&#13;
every environmentalist on the face of the earth down my back."&#13;
&#13;
So I said, "Gautam," I said, "this is my analysis of it, and just tell me where I am wrong. And if&#13;
I'm wrong, I'll go away, and I'll be very happy because I won't feel as though I've done my job&#13;
badly."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "No, you're right. That was part of my problem with Pak Mun, because I could see all&#13;
of the reasons to do it."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was Pak Mun ultimately financed?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Pak Mun was financed. It was inside Thailand, and it was a small dam--it was a 60-&#13;
megawatt project. And Nam Theun, they were talking about anywhere between 600 and 1,200&#13;
megawatts. So, I mean, that's a big deal.&#13;
&#13;
So, anyway, I mean he bore out that we were right. And he said, "Look, when I was your&#13;
director, and you were working for Inder on this, your position was that you wanted to take an&#13;
environmentally responsible approach to doing this project. As long as this is our approach, I&#13;
will back this project because I understand the compelling nature of it for Laos."&#13;
&#13;
So, you know, when Madavo heard that we had been to see Kaji, he decided to make time for us,&#13;
and we did. We went in, and again I dredged out the question, "What else does Laos have to&#13;
jumpstart their economy?"&#13;
&#13;
And Madavo saw that very quickly, and, you know, as we were about to leave his office, he&#13;
called me back, and he said, "You know, I was worried that you were going to come up with&#13;
something compelling because I really would have preferred to avoid all of this, but let&#13;
Transfield come."&#13;
&#13;
Transfield came. They had a delegation of about five people. McGarry was at the head of it.&#13;
And Madavo's message to them was that, you know, first of all, since this is a private&#13;
development, we don't even know how we fit in, but if they think it's important, we are certainly&#13;
willing to maintain communications, but we have two prerequisites. One is that the project has&#13;
to be done in an environmentally responsible way, and we're the judges of that, not Transfield.&#13;
The second piece was that the deal has to be a good one for Laos, and on the basis of the press&#13;
releases, it seemed very one-sided in favor of the contractors.&#13;
&#13;
Well, at that point Transfield decided that they didn't like me anymore because the only way that&#13;
the World Bank could have thought that the deal was one-sided for the contractors is because I&#13;
had been privy to the material on the deal, so I had analyzed it. And it was true; it was very one-&#13;
sided.&#13;
&#13;
You know, we sparred in the shadows for about a year, and then finally Transfield decided to&#13;
come back to the Bank. And they had this major visit in '95, largely because, you know, they&#13;
couldn't shake the Bank so they figured, okay, McGarry was the one who figured, "If I can't get&#13;
rid of the devil, then I'd better make a deal with him."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Is that two Rs in McGarry?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yes. M-C-G-A-R-R-Y.&#13;
&#13;
In June of '95, I was invited to give a speech at a presentation in London on hydropower, and&#13;
McGarry-you know, I had arranged for McGarry also to be on the program. And we went out&#13;
to dinner, and we really got along well, and that created a friendship. And to me, the sad thing&#13;
was when McGarry decided to leave Transfield because he really, you know, he understood&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
where we were coming from, and he understood why this was important to be done in a&#13;
responsible way.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Let me just move the tape forward now.&#13;
&#13;
[End! Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Now, at the end of June in '95 was when I made this presentation in London, I got to&#13;
know McGarry, and things were beginning to look pretty good.&#13;
&#13;
Then all of a sudden one major event took place within the Bank. Vineet was offered the job of&#13;
becoming CEO of Hewlett-Packard India and took it, and as a result of that, you know, I was&#13;
going to wind up with a new division chief, and that new division chief was a guy named&#13;
[Jayasankar] Shivakumar.&#13;
&#13;
If I liked and respected Vineet, I liked and respected Shiva even more. And before he took over&#13;
I went to his office and talked to him about Nam Theun, and his reaction was the same as&#13;
everybody's reaction up to that point which was, "Why do you want to do this? Why do you&#13;
want to do this to you?" And, you know, "Here I am, I am going to become your division chief,&#13;
and the first thing I'm going to have to do is bail you out ofNam Theun. I mean, this is nuts."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Shiva, I have encountered the same question from Kaji, from Madavo, from Vineet. All&#13;
of them are very smart people, and they all came on board. Now, I can't be that much of a&#13;
seductor. There's got to be something here."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Okay, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let's go on mission together; we'll put&#13;
together a large mission. I'm going to follow your advice on how to do this, okay, but let's do it&#13;
around November, because that will be early in my time and I won't have acquired a lot of biases&#13;
and I'll be able to see this for what it's worth."&#13;
&#13;
I said to him, "Okay, if we're going to do this, and we're going to give the world the view that&#13;
we're doing this in an environmentally responsible way, then I want this to be a large mission&#13;
which you will lead, not me. And I want this to include some of the Bank's best environmental&#13;
people and some of the Bank's best social people in addition to the project team, so that that way&#13;
right from the start we hear from Gloria [J.] Davis, we hear from Robert [J.] Goodland, we hear&#13;
from [Kathryn] McPhail, we hear from the people who, you know, will have to answer to. And&#13;
let them tell us, because ifthis is dead on arrival, let them tell us now."&#13;
&#13;
Gloria Davis was at the center, Kathryn McPhail was at the center, Robert Goodland was at the&#13;
center. We had a guy named Glenn [S.] Morgan from the East Asia Region. Maritta [R.V.B.]&#13;
Koch-Weser was the division chief in the Region. She was extremely hostile to Nam Theun.&#13;
Glenn was willing to come on the mission provided that he didn't have to tell Maritta until two&#13;
days before he left, and we honored that obligation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, I mean-so this was the stage. We met with Transfield, and we met with the Lao&#13;
    u.u.''"''" out there. And Transfield,  the        of a     named Hans Fischer,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Shiva and I did our work, and Shiva became sold that this was a good project, a project that&#13;
should be done for the good of the country. He also became convinced that there was a lot of&#13;
work to do, that, you know, we needed to go to great lengths to prove to the world that this was a&#13;
compelling project that could be done in a responsible manner.&#13;
&#13;
We had a meeting with environmentalists. It was a large meeting that lasted about four or five&#13;
hours in Vientiane. It was in a satellite building of UNDP. We were very open with them. We&#13;
shared a lot of information. We answered every single one oftheir questions. Charlie Palmer&#13;
was there; he remembered me from the earlier meeting. There were some people there who were&#13;
much more hostile. But one of the reasons I remember Charlie's name is because at the three&#13;
meetings I attended with environmentalists, he was the constant, and he was willing to be very&#13;
fair about it.&#13;
&#13;
Two days before the wrap-up, we decided that we better have lunch with Hans Fischer. We did.&#13;
And we explained to Fischer that we're at the beginning of a very, very long road, and Fischer's&#13;
response was, "We have a schedule we have to keep to."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Hans, you're going to be very disappointed."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, I can't be disappointed. My bosses in Sydney won't take that."&#13;
&#13;
Then, we: "You've got two days to think about how you are going to react, because this is the&#13;
message that we're going to wind up giving."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             And that was the way the meeting ended.&#13;
&#13;
This occasioned a major upset ofTransfield. They visited Washington in February ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: February of ..&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: .. '96, and by then Gautam had moved to the Managing Director's office and Russ&#13;
[Russell J.] Cheetham, who was Australian, was the vice president. And, you know, they beat&#13;
the table and goodness knows what else and said that, you know, they wanted us to do this&#13;
project, and Cheetham said, "No."&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So at that point my role changed. I became the person at headquarters that was Shivakumar's-&#13;
you know, the one Shiva spent a lot of time with--and Shiva became the task manager; even at&#13;
the point when he was country director for Thailand, he was the task manager. So that's the story&#13;
ofNam Theun.&#13;
&#13;
Now, there'is one additional piece on Nam Theun, and then I'll-and one additional piece on&#13;
Laos--and then I'll leave you to ask me questions.&#13;
&#13;
In March '96 it had not yet become public knowledge that, you know, I was being retired or&#13;
mov1~d upstairs on Nam Theun, although I knew because Shivakumar, you know, kept me well-&#13;
informed about what was going on with this, that that was ultimately going to be the move, and&#13;
he said, you know, "I'm going to do what I can to bring you back, because I really need you."&#13;
And,, you know, my role became one of an advisor, and even though I was at the Staff&#13;
Association, I continued to advise Shiva.&#13;
&#13;
Maritta Koch-Weser was absolutely livid that this project was still alive, and, you know, she&#13;
asked for, demanded, and Callisto was willing to put together a meeting which Kaji attended,&#13;
you know, that was there to allow her to say, you know, over her dead body was this going to get&#13;
done.&#13;
&#13;
Richard [D.] Stem at that time was the director for """""'"'n'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Near the end of the meeting, Richard Stem spoke up, and Richard said, he&#13;
said, "Look, first of all, you can rant and rave all you want, but what I'm hearing in this meeting&#13;
is an exercise in unreality. There are very few hydro sites left in the world today that can&#13;
produce electricity at less than 2 cents per kilowatt hour. Nam Theun can." He said, "No matter&#13;
how you cut it, economically this is a good project. It is one of the best. It's one of the few&#13;
reallly good ones." He said, "Now, you can talk all you want about the environmental problems,&#13;
but we have an obligation to our borrower that we cannot bury a project of this quality. Second,&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes. We've mentioned previously that this project generated a great many&#13;
objetCtions and concerns.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In your view, which were the most valid and which the least? I mean, sometimes I&#13;
get the impression that the NGO environmentalists, grow a bit hysterical, but there are also valid&#13;
objections. So how did these play out?&#13;
&#13;
SOI,HER: There were two or three areas where, you know, I felt that the environmentalists had&#13;
a very good point and we needed to pay attention.&#13;
&#13;
First, Laos is a land of pristine pine forests and some wetlands, and from an environmental point&#13;
of view pristine forests and wetlands are very important features. My concern was that there was&#13;
no alternative way of doing the project. The topography worked out so that the land sloped&#13;
gently downward until it came into a ravine, and that ravine was high on both sides and very low&#13;
in the middle. So essentially you had a very low-cost dam at that point which could create a lake&#13;
of several hundred square kilometers, and then, you know, there was a big drop that became&#13;
possible to generate hydroelectricity. The important thing about that is that you would have&#13;
added about 100 to 150 million dollars to the cost of the project if you sited the dam anywhere&#13;
else. That neck made it that it was a very short dam, okay. Anywhere else would have been&#13;
very long. So it had to be there. Now, what was directly behind that ravine and that dam site?&#13;
Over 100 square miles of pine forest--pristine. Every single tree would have to be cut. Nothing&#13;
was salvageable from that. That is very legit. That is a very legit concern.&#13;
&#13;
The second thing was that there were some species of animals that were rare in that area. One of&#13;
my favorite stories ofthis project, Chuck, goes back to 1990, when the pre-feasibility study for&#13;
the project was going on. I was in Laos, and I got a telex from Inder Sud, who was my boss at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that time. It said, "Jamil, met earlier today with representatives ofWorld.Wildlife Federation,&#13;
and they indicated that in the Nam Theun II project site, there are two endangered species of&#13;
monkeys which will die if the project is put together. Please advise."&#13;
&#13;
IUCN, which is the other big, you know, multi-headed NGO, they were represented in Vientiane&#13;
by a guy named Salter, Canadian.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I'm sorry. IUCN?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: International Union for the Conservation ofNature.&#13;
&#13;
And Jack Salter was a Canadian. He was then approximately our age now, very crusty; I mean,&#13;
he had spent all of his life working in, you know, these backwaters, and he loved it, and partÂ·of&#13;
the reason he loved it was because he could be short and snippy with guys like me.&#13;
&#13;
So I went down to his office. I'd come to know him because I was a frequent visitor to Laos. I&#13;
showed him Inder's telex, and I said, "Salter, are there these monkeys?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Yeah, there are. They are langurs. There is douc langur and francois langur. It's not&#13;
two separate ones but two separate species." He said, "They are rare, and they inhabit the project&#13;
area . "&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What do we do about them?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Put them on the back of a flatbed truck and move them to higher ground. Then they&#13;
won't get flooded."&#13;
&#13;
So that afternoon, I went back to the hotel, I put together a telex for Inder. I said, "IUCN&#13;
confirms that there are these endangered monkeys. They are called langurs. One species is douc&#13;
langur, the other is francois langur. And the concern about their survival can be addressed by&#13;
putting them on the back of a flatbed truck and moving them to higher ground." I thought that&#13;
was the end of it.&#13;
&#13;
The next morning, telex from Inder: "World Wildlife Federation says that these monkeys won't&#13;
mate at higher ground. Please advise."&#13;
&#13;
I take this telex back to Salter. "Salter, will they or won't they mate?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "I'll tell you what. Why don't you get a third floor suite at the Lanzan Hotel, put a few&#13;
of them in there and see what happens?"&#13;
&#13;
So I write back: "Inder, IUCN advises that we take a third floor suite at the Lanzan Hotel and&#13;
put in a few of these langurs and see what happens." I never heard another word from him.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But, you know, the thing is that, yes, this was an area that had massive wildlife that, you know,&#13;
was going to take a hit.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the contrary side of it was that there was--Laos is a country ofwarlords. You know, the&#13;
government in Vientiane doesn't control very much. What they have is a loose alliance with&#13;
these warlords all over the areas. The warlord who was in charge of this particular area was a&#13;
guy named General Chang, and General Chang had--was either the principal owner or, you&#13;
know, the sole owner, for all I know, of a thing called the Mountain Area Development&#13;
Corporation. And it sounded, you know, like a great name, but you mentioned Mountain Area&#13;
Development Corporation in Vientiane and people suddenly became scared. And I was really&#13;
taken with the level of fear engendered whenever I mentioned the name of Mountain&#13;
Development.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, what Mountain Development was was a group of army people who essentially were&#13;
cutting down the biggest and best of the trees, logging them, cutting them into good boards and&#13;
selling them to the Japanese. I went up to the project area three or four times, and each time I'd&#13;
see these trucks taking out logs in large quantities. So, you know, the environmentalists were&#13;
tumi~ng a blind eye to this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There was one other thing ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Do you think it was a blind eye or did they not know?&#13;
&#13;
SOIâ&#128;¢HER: I think they were turning a blind eye because, you know, how could Japan import so&#13;
much teak from Laos without it coming out of there, okay, and how could they import so much&#13;
pine from Laos without it coming out of there?&#13;
&#13;
On another occasion, I went up to the project area--you know, each of these trips was in the&#13;
Mikoyan helicopter--I think it was Mikoyan 87; Mikoyan, anyway, was the name ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Very likely. MI.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah, yeah. And I would go up to the project area in this rickety thing thinking that&#13;
this is Â·one of the stupidest things I have ever done, I'm taking my life in my hands. And on one&#13;
trip, to give Shivakumar the seat, I sat on the fuel tank, so, you know, that was incredibly stupid.&#13;
&#13;
But in any event, you know, I was up at the project area. I was going around; I was trying to get&#13;
a sense of what this was like and, you know, what the environmental problems were. And we&#13;
stopped at a campsite for lunch, and I was given this lunch, and it was a meat dish, and the meat&#13;
tasted very good--it was grilled meat--so I asked what the meat was. And one of the guys that&#13;
was with me said, "Do you remember those monkeys?" [Laughter] And it was true, you know.&#13;
&#13;
So the thing was that they can blame the project all they want, but things were going on. This is&#13;
not a static situation that they're dealing with. And, you know, unless somebody came in and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
really began to talk about doing things in a responsible way and conditioning the Lao to what it&#13;
means to be responsible, both on the environmental side and on the social side, there would have&#13;
been devastation without the project, and there would have been devastation with the project.&#13;
&#13;
So, you know, to me the benefit of the project and one of the reasons I list it as one of the biggies&#13;
in my experience is because of the fact that we essentially changed or we--I can't say that we&#13;
have succeeded in doing it, but we've tried to change national culture, governmental culture,&#13;
with respect to the poor and downtrodden who live off the environment.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That's really interesting. Did you maintain any subsequent connection or interest,&#13;
official or unofficial, in the project after you left it in what, '96, I believe you said?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah. Unofficially, yeah, I maintained a great deal of interest in it. I have&#13;
maintained my very good friendship with Shivakumar. I received an e-mail from him the day&#13;
that ilt went to the Board telling me that if he is thought of as "the father ofNam Theun," I'm the&#13;
"grandfather." And I admire him a great deal. Frankly, you know, ifl had not been taken off&#13;
Nam Theun and I had continued to work on it, I probably would not have run for Staff&#13;
Association Chair because, you know, that was one of the things to which I was very, very&#13;
deeply committed. I felt that the Bank had an obligation to find a responsible way to do hydro.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Do you think it largely succeeded in doing that?&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: I don't know. You know, hindsight is the best way to see it. But what I do believe is&#13;
that one impact from my early involvement was this is being done as a private development in a&#13;
country where the level of communism at the time when we started was, seemed impenetrable.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Finally on this, are there any lessons, in your opinion, to be learned by the Bank or&#13;
anybody else from this Nam Theun project?&#13;
&#13;
SOI,HER: I think that we're going to wind up drawing hundreds of lessons from it, lessons that&#13;
range all the way from how do you talk to NGOs to how do you talk to private developers to--&#13;
and on a personal level, you know, how--what does the future task manager do to keep himself,&#13;
you know, from being in the line of fire as much as I was. I mean, I was in the line of fire from&#13;
outside NGOs, from Transfield, from, you know, the head of the Environmental Division in our&#13;
Teclmical Department to, you know--arid in some cases, it became very, very personal.&#13;
&#13;
 But the thing that-the other side to it is that it is very important for an individual like me, who&#13;
was not an economist, who had strong views about a project, to be capable of talking to the&#13;
economists who run the Bank in their own language. I don't think that there would have been a&#13;
ghost's chance in hell of that project getting the time of day from the World Bank's East Asia&#13;
Region ifl had been unable to convince Vineet Nayyar, Gautam Kaji, Callisto Madavo and&#13;
Shivakumar about the worth, the compelling nature of this project. And I only was able to do it&#13;
when I put it to them on their terms: what alternatives did Laos have?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Anything else you care to say about the project, Jamil?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Just that I really love it. I love it more for what it represents. I don't know the&#13;
details of the design anymore or stufflike that, but I love the fact that it's a project that involves&#13;
the export of electricity because I think that we need to get into, you know, those sorts of&#13;
regional-type projects more than we do.&#13;
&#13;
I lov~~ the fact that we spent close to 20 years developing it so we would do it right. Whether we&#13;
have or not, I don't know, but at least the intention was there, and the Bank's good intentions&#13;
were manifest.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, thanks very much, Jamil. At our next meeting, we'll take up your&#13;
involvement with the Staff Association.&#13;

                                        Washington, DC&#13;
&#13;
(Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Today is September 9, 2005. My name is Charles Ziegler, a consultant for the Oral&#13;
History Program of the World Bank Group. I'm at the home of Jamil Sopher to continue this&#13;
series of oral history interviews with him.&#13;
&#13;
Today we'll be discussing Jamil's experiences with the World Bank Group Staff Association.&#13;
This will, I think, be a particularly illuminating session as Jamil has proven himself to be acutely&#13;
perceptive in drawing lessons from events, as well as being an active participant in many of&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
The internal administration of the World Bank is treated in a cursory manner in institutional&#13;
histories, when it's treated at all. It is argued that what is important is how well the Bank helps&#13;
its cllients. This is undoubtedly true, but it is equally true that the Bank's ability to do so is&#13;
powerfully affected by its internal administrative processes, especially those touching on human&#13;
resource issues. So I look forward to what I anticipate will be a particularly valuable interview.&#13;
Jamill?&#13;
&#13;
SOJâ&#128;¢HER: Sure. If you don't mind, I'm going to start with a bit of a digression. One of the&#13;
things that we did not talk about last week which I think is fairly important--and it's most&#13;
important with regard to the Staff Association period--is what were the strengths and what were&#13;
the weaknesses that I brought to the job. And I really see it as though there are several areas that&#13;
define me differently from an awful lot of my colleagues.&#13;
&#13;
Firs1l of all, I'm not, you know, from the Bank's standard discipline--economics or engineering. I&#13;
did get educated as an engineer, but I'm largely a financial analyst. What that meant in&#13;
Operations is that I was able to look at the same body of information that my colleagues did, but&#13;
I saw different things, okay.&#13;
&#13;
The second thing was that I was always very willing to stand my ground on stuff, to the point&#13;
where, you know, I was perceived at some points as cantankerous but at the same time, you&#13;
know, unwilling to let go on things that I thought were important. And when you come at a&#13;
problem from a different point of view, that's important because, you know, what is likely to&#13;
happen is you're filling up somebody else's blind spots.&#13;
&#13;
And the third thing was that I always felt I wanted to bring about change but I wanted to do it&#13;
through the system. I had a fundamental respect and genuine liking for the people that I was&#13;
dealling with, so that, you know, even if we wound up fighting about professional things, I really&#13;
didn't want to fight them on a personal basis. I wanted to differentiate between the personal and&#13;
the professional.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, in Operations, that set of qualities stood me well in the sense that the people I worked with&#13;
felt that I was an indispensable member of the team, okay. But at the same time, it was a&#13;
problem with regard to promotion because there were people who fit the Bank norm a lot better&#13;
than I did, you know, who also did good work and who could lay claim to the next level of jobs.&#13;
&#13;
I felt that the Staff Association gave me the opportunity to use these skills at a more senior level&#13;
in the Bank. Admittedly, it was not a permanent appointment;Â· it was something where there was&#13;
a finite period of time. But I just felt that, you know, if these skills served me well in Operations,&#13;
they ought to serve me well when dealing with management.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: By way of explanation for those reading the transcript, the Staff Association&#13;
chairman is elected forone year.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: It's one year, but the limitation is that you can only serve for 3 consecutive years on&#13;
the Executive Committee [EC]. And most people who run for chair usually spend a year on the&#13;
Executive Committee in a lesser capacity before running for chair. So over the last ten, twelve&#13;
years, or thereabouts, I think it's been the norm that most people serve two-year terms. Morallina&#13;
George served three, but, you know, there were explanations.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And Morallina was your successor, as I recall.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Initially, what made you decide to become active in the Staff Association? Now,&#13;
you've touched on it a bit here in your introduction.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, actually, what got me involved in the first place was something quite different.&#13;
When I was recruited for the Bank and then hired, the person who was my mentor and who made&#13;
a huge, huge difference in my life was a gentleman named Frank Lamson-Scribner. Frank--&#13;
Frank was a personality type--still is, I guess--very similar to me in the sense that if something&#13;
struck him as an injustice, he was willing to spend a lot of time and a lot of effort dealing with it.&#13;
Frank felt that the change in the tax allowance regime that was brought about in, during the '76 to&#13;
'78 period, was a massive injustice to U.S. staff. And as a result of that, when it was first&#13;
proposed he became a very important member of the U.S. Tax Working Group.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Of the Staff Association.&#13;
&#13;
SOlt&gt;HER: Of the Staff Association. By the time I became a staff member, the battle was&#13;
fought and lost, and, you know, the question was when is it going to get put on the burner again,&#13;
and it was fairly clear it wasn't going to happen for a period of years. But Frank always had a&#13;
very warm feeling for the time and effort he put in for the Staff Association because it appealed&#13;
to his personal interest in fighting for the rights of the underdog.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Frank retired in late 1981, summer '81, and just before his--no, '82, I'm sorry-and just before his&#13;
retirement, he pulled me aside, he said, "Look," he said, "you know, I brought you in, I recruited&#13;
you. It's been a good decision. You've done an awful lot of operational work right. I'm going to&#13;
ask you the only favor I've asked you, and that is, after I've gone, step into the Staff Association&#13;
and continue what I've started."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That's a story I didn't know.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Now, I mean, how can I say no to the man who was my mentor? You know, I&#13;
figured that I was coming to the World Bank for a very short-term experience, and, you know, he&#13;
turned it into my career. So I told him I would. And the first thing I did was to contact Jeff&#13;
[Jeffrey A.] Katz, who at that point was the only surviving member of the U.S. Tax Working&#13;
Group from the big negotiation of the late '70s, volunteered my services. Jeff and I went out to&#13;
lunch. The personal chemistry was very good, and at that point, you know, he decided that since&#13;
we didn't even have a committee, why not make me co-chair? And that was the start of it. So&#13;
that's where it all began.&#13;
&#13;
Now, how did I become involved on the Compensation Working Group, which was my next&#13;
stepping ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, what happened finally with the Tax Working Group?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, the Tax Working Group was dormant for about four years, five years. I mean,&#13;
this was 1982, and what Jeff and I did from about '82 to '85 was to just, you know, do a little bit&#13;
of sniping here and there whenever tax issues came up. Jeffwas very good at dealing with my&#13;
impatience because I really wanted to re-engage this issue. But in '86 there was an opportunity&#13;
to re-engage on tax issues, and then we revitalized the Tax Working Group. I'm not sure, but I&#13;
think you may have been one of the people ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Not on the Tax Working Group, no.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: All right. And we negotiated again. That was where we did make one contribution&#13;
that I feel, you know, was a real success of that effort, and that was that we extended the safety&#13;
net that applied only to U.S. staff who were on board before January 1, 1980, to all U.S. staff.&#13;
I'm not sure that as many people use it as could benefit from it, but I am certain that the ones&#13;
who do really need it.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Good. We're not going quite strictly chronologically, but I know you got involved&#13;
in the Compensation Working Group before the 1987 reorganization, but the final fruits ofthat&#13;
Compensation Working Group, at least the first stage, would have been 1989. So instead I'm&#13;
going to ask you about discussing your perspective from both Operations and from the Staff&#13;
Association ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
SOPHER: May I correct you, Chuck? I was recruited onto the Compensation Working Group&#13;
in 1984, and that was because the first breakdown of the old, you know, increase according to&#13;
inflation occurred, and occurred in a big way. Damian Von Stauffenberg was the Chair in '83.&#13;
He was able to prevent it from breaking down. But in '84, his successor was Donneve Rae.&#13;
Donneve Rae had been an assistant-level staff member, and the management felt pretty&#13;
comfortable that they could overwhelm her.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And I think she was the first female chairman of the Staff Association, if I&#13;
remember correctly.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: She may have been. You know, she certainly was in my period, but what I don't&#13;
know is whether somebody, there was a female head of the Staff Association before I arrived.&#13;
&#13;
No, this was '85, January '85, when Donneve called me, and she said, "Look, I have real&#13;
difficulty because these people are not taking the Staff Association seriously as a partner, and I&#13;
need to put together a working group that's got some muscle. What do you think?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, first of all, because of operational issues, you know, I can't chair it. I just&#13;
don't have the time. Second, there are a couple of people who I think are very good." One of&#13;
them was Chris Parel, and I said, "I think you ought to recruit him, but I think that he'll also have&#13;
difficulty being chair."&#13;
&#13;
So there was an old retiree named Frank--and I can't remember ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, Frank Peacock, wasn't it?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: No, wasn't Peacock.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I know who you mean, yes. [Frank Povey]&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: He was a very kind fellow with white hair, very well meaning, and so nominally he&#13;
became the chair. But the real spear carriers were Chris, myself, yourself--you joined at some&#13;
point in that period.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: 1985, it would have been.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah. Elaine [W.] Patterson was part ofthe group, and she was very good.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Mm-hmm, I remember her.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: And then, you know, we had people who came in and out who also made a big&#13;
contribution. But the other long-term person on the Compensation Working Group was John&#13;
Alvey, and once again he served with a lot of distinction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 ZIEGLER: And he ultimately became chairman of the Staff Association.&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
, ZIEGLER: Well, we can go into compensation then. From your perspective as Compensation&#13;
  Working Group co-chairman, please relate some of the events that led to the formulation and&#13;
  implementation of the Revised Compensation System. Now, it is a long story. It goes back&#13;
  several years.&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: It's-it's sort of interesting because, you know, this--I got my start in this during the&#13;
 [Alden W.] Clausen period. And, I mean, this is 20 years later, and I'm still trying to find some&#13;
 redeeming features to Clausen. But the--his disregard for staff was really a very important&#13;
 memory that I have of that period.&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: And my recollection is he was astonished to find that there was a Staff Association.&#13;
 Basically, well, you know: management runs this place, what do we need a Staff Association&#13;
 for?&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: And the other thing was: Why do we even need to talk to you? Â·&#13;
&#13;
 Now, the VP for HR [Human Resources] at the time was Martijn J.W.M. Paijmans, and I kind of&#13;
 after the--at the time I really disliked him. But after the fact, I came to see him as a much more&#13;
 sympathetic figure than I thought he was because he was the one who was tasked with having to&#13;
 tell the staff what was the outcome of decisions that had been made without, you know, taking&#13;
 staff views into consideration at all.&#13;
&#13;
 Now, in 1982, I believe it was, a gentleman named Beryl [W.] Sprinkel became a very important&#13;
 play,er in the [Ronald W.] Reagan Treasury, and he had some oversight function. I don't&#13;
 remember his title. I remember him very vividly, though. He quizzed me a number of times on&#13;
 some of my projects.&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: Oh, personally?&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: Personally.&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: Projects meaning Bank-related projects?&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: Yeah. Beryl Sprinkel not only had a strongly formed view that the Bank was full of&#13;
 waste and that sort of thing, but he also had been rejected for employment at the Bank at least&#13;
 twic:e that I'm aware of, so there was a certain antipathy that ran very, very deep. And one of his&#13;
 favorite hobby horses was we were overpaid; I think he was the one who gave the quote to the&#13;
 Wall Street Journal that we dine on cote de veau and Cote de Rhone, and, you know, there's&#13;
 certainly enough people in the U.S. Government doing much better and harder jobs and therefore&#13;
 this is inappropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 So he--I think it was in 1983--targeted the salary increase as something that, you know, he felt he&#13;
 needed to take up in a major way. And then in '84, it became--that entire unit at Treasury that&#13;
 oversees the multilateral development banks, that then began to hone in on salaries and tried to,&#13;
 you know, challenge whether or not we were worth that kind of an increase.&#13;
&#13;
 In 1980, in order to insulate us a little bit, there was the makings of a comparator system. But&#13;
 the making of the comparator system was as a reference check on the old system of cost-of-&#13;
 living increases plus merit increases. And in 1980, there was a 10 percent increase that was an&#13;
 adjustment to bring us up into line with the comparators.&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: This is a period of high inflation, as I recall.&#13;
&#13;
 SOI,HER: It was a period of high inflation. And then there was a 9 percent increase for that&#13;
 year, and then the following year there was 6 percent. So, you know, the--when Sprinkel first&#13;
 begc:m to challenge our pay increases, it was because there had been a track record over a period&#13;
 of a few years where we did very well.&#13;
&#13;
 In '84, I don't remember that it was Sprinkel himself that led the charge, but by then the office of&#13;
 the [U.S.] Treasury that oversees the Bank became really charged up, and they led it almost as a&#13;
 campaign that we should get a lesser increase than--you know, than ..&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: The system would have called for.&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
  SOl'HER: And I think we wound up getting something like about 2 percent less, but then there&#13;
  was the merit portion that was added on, so, you know, in principle we got what at least senior&#13;
Â· management thought was appropriate, albeit instead of in two increments in one.&#13;
&#13;
 And Clausen, of course, never wanted to talk to any of us about that, and we were reluctantly&#13;
 invited to make a presentation to the Board on what our views were. And I think that was the&#13;
 first of the [World Bank Administrative] Tribunal actions that we-that we brought, and we lost&#13;
 it.&#13;
&#13;
 That was when in '85 Donneve reconstituted us as a group, and for those first two years, it was a&#13;
 very informal group.&#13;
&#13;
 [Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: Now, in 1985 the increase we were awarded was more or less in line with the&#13;
 system, so we didn't wind up having a real knock-down, drag-out on that. But in '86, that's when&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  49&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
everything went haywire, and essentially the Board granted no increase that year. And at that&#13;
point, you know, the fact that Frank was chairing the working group became very inconvenient&#13;
to Chris [Christopher J.] Redfern, who at that point had now become the chair.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Ofthe Staff Association.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Of the Staff Association. And I remember accompanying Chris to Clausen's office,&#13;
and Clausen's response to us was, you know, "You'd be perfectly within your right to sue us,"&#13;
which kind of set the guidelines on how much he would or wouldn't do.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He wasn't being sarcastic in this case?&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: No. He was just being Clausen.&#13;
&#13;
A few weeks after that happened, [Barber B.] Conable became the President, so, you know, there&#13;
were a lot of events that happened at that time.&#13;
&#13;
Now, we had a major outpouring of staff in the courtyard where we held a-where held a rally.&#13;
Chris was a--Chris Parel was a very effective speaker, as well as Chris Redfern. People tell me&#13;
that I gave a good talk. And ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: My recollection also is there was a work stoppage even, for at least one day. It was&#13;
over Memorial Day weekend; it kind of coincided with Memorial Day.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: But we weren't able to get a lot of people to stop working. We were able to have a&#13;
slowdown for hours, okay--but not--we couldn't get people to stay home a full day.&#13;
&#13;
But the thing--the reason I highlight the fact that Chris was an--Chris Parel was an effective&#13;
speaker was that that was the event that gave rise to Chris Redfern deciding, you know, we've&#13;
got to be the chairs of the working group because he needs people there who can talk with&#13;
authority, who are knowledgeable and, you know, who present better than he felt Frank did.&#13;
&#13;
We didn't get a pay increase at the time we were supposed to, but then--and we did go to the&#13;
Tribunal and bring up an action. But before the Tribunal was able to rule--and very likely they&#13;
would have ruled in our favor--what happened was that the Bank Board decided to relent in&#13;
December and provided us with an increase retroactive to May, okay.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the same Board action specified that management would be required to conduct a review&#13;
of the compensation system and to move from what they perceived as a subjective system to&#13;
something that was much more objective.&#13;
&#13;
Now, timing here is sort of important. Conable, as I said, took over in late '86, and one ofthe&#13;
first things that happened was that Conable was--made the decision that there was going to be a&#13;
major reorganization. He constituted a Reorganization Committee, and the staff felt justifiably&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
threatened by that. And Chris Redfern put together a very substantial committee to deal with the&#13;
reorganization and, you know, consult to the degree that anyone was willing to consult with us.&#13;
&#13;
The :Staff Association Delegate Assembly at the time made a decision that, you know,&#13;
subsequently has proven to be very, very wise. They felt that it would be a poor idea to change&#13;
chairs right in the middle of the reorganization. They also reasoned that the most important thing&#13;
we did year by year was compensation, and to have the Chair's term begin in July, which was&#13;
just after the end of the compensation review, would be a very significant discontinuity,&#13;
especially since we were now moving to a point where the pay increase, instead of being handed&#13;
out in May, we were now going to hand it out in, as of July 1.&#13;
&#13;
So the Delegate Assembly, through some extraordinary action--and I don't know that there was&#13;
any eonstitutional basis for it ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: There was because I was head of the ...&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Oh, okay.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I was the one who drafted the constitutional changes, as it happens, because I was&#13;
on the Executive Committee.&#13;
&#13;
SOI'HER: Way to go. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
They voted to extend Chris by six months and also to rework the electoral term from January to&#13;
December. And, well, you know ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Instead of on a fiscal year basis.&#13;
&#13;
SOJ&gt;HER: Yes. That was a very good piece ofwork you did, Chuck.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Anyway, so that brings us up to--now, the whole issue of the review of&#13;
compensation was lost during '87. '87 was heavily focused on the reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which we'll go into in some detail in a bit.&#13;
&#13;
S01l'HER: Right. But, you know, the other things that had been promised all kind of slid to&#13;
1988, and that was where the negotiations of the Revised Compensation System started.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And we had--who were some of the people, the significant personalities on the&#13;
management side with whom you acted as the Compensation Working Group co-chairman? I&#13;
remember Peter Karp was one, Ian Burne for a while.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER:       I remember ..&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Ian was the Director, so Peter nominally worked for him. Before the reworking of&#13;
the salary system, we worked a lot with Reg [Reginald A.] Clarke. That was in the period from&#13;
about '84 to '87.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And he was Director of Personnel at the time ..&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: .. and then when Personnel split, he went over to--what?--the portion of it that&#13;
oversaw compensation.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Mm-hmm.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He was an old British colonial civil servant.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He'd served in Nigeria, as I recall.&#13;
&#13;
SOI'HER: The thing I remember about Reg was that he had a great dislike for U.S. staff. He&#13;
had a lot of baggage that came from the fight over both the expatriate allowances and the tax&#13;
allowance, the fights of the mid-'70s. And by the time we worked with him, both on&#13;
compensation and on taxes, he wouldn't miss an opportunity to throw a barb in our direction&#13;
about, you know, our big mortgages and our big houses. And it was very clear that--that there&#13;
was something that still stuck in his craw, and in my opinion, we were very lucky when he&#13;
retired in the midst of the '87 reorganization. Ian Hume took over. You know, I don't remember&#13;
Ian very well as a director because I thought he was a fish out of water at HR. He really wanted&#13;
to b~ back in Operations, and when he did go back to Operations, he was very good. He was one&#13;
of the directors that opened up Central Europe.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What's interesting, too, is that Ian Hume is one of the six staff who kicked off the&#13;
idea of a Staff Association. He was one ofthe founding fathers. So it's somewhat ironic that he&#13;
was sitting on the opposite side of the table, at least for a little while.&#13;
&#13;
S01l&gt;HER: But, you know, it's indicative to me that if we don't remember at least his role&#13;
insofar as this is concerned, then either he did a very good job or else he did no job. The one I&#13;
remember and I remember very vividly is Peter Karp, and I also remember that Bill [William J.]&#13;
Cosgrove was the Vice President for HR ofthe period. And when ..&#13;
&#13;

ZIEGLER: He was Vice President for--he was my VP, so he would have been for&#13;
administration ..&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: .. but he would have covered Personnel, too, I believe, at that time, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: He was VP during the compensation discussions, and he went--he was there from&#13;
reorganization in '87 until about 1990 when he left. And the reason I remember Bill is twofold:&#13;
first, he was an old water supply guy, and I knew him from my early period as, you know, a&#13;
director who had a very real facility with water supply and sanitation matters. But the other&#13;
reason is because when Peter Karp needed managerial support for a position he was staking out,&#13;
he usually didn't bring Ian Hume. He usually brought Bill Cosgrove. So, you know, I mean,&#13;
that--that told me how the lines of authority ran.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Mm-hrnm, mm-hrnm. Well, ultimately the Revised Compensation System was&#13;
adopted. What was your opinion of that compensation system as it eventually emerged? And&#13;
that, in fact, became effective on May 1, 1989.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Yeah. This may surprise you, okay, but, you know, every system, whether it's an&#13;
accounting system or whether it's a compensation system or whether it's any other sort of system,&#13;
is imperfect. There are a lot of trade-offs that go into the development of a system, and there are&#13;
very few where the trade-offs will all go the right way. You have to figure out that what a&#13;
system is is a structured way of taking, of turning one highly subjective decision into a bunch of&#13;
much smaller subjective decisions that are made upstream from that, so that there's the&#13;
appearance that what comes out is something hard ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: .. is something firm. And one of the things I learned--and I really learned it through&#13;
both the negotiations and then the implementation of the Revised Compensation System--is that&#13;
then~ is the ability, if you're getting the wrong outcome, to fiddle with the data or to fiddle with&#13;
one aspect of the system or two aspects of the system that may be slightly ambivalent this year so&#13;
that you can, you know, use it to get a better outcome.&#13;
&#13;
That said, we have a very awkward situation in the Bank where we pride ourselves on being&#13;
analytically one of the more serious organizations ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIE:GLER: And rigorous.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: .. and rigorous organizations anywhere in the world, okay, and at the same time our&#13;
primary arrangement for accountability is political. The Board of Governors is made up of&#13;
Ministers of Finance who are all political people, and the--our Board of Executive Directors is&#13;
built from Ministries of Finance, which means that there's a political dimension to all of this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                     53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So the only way I can see that you can have the pay of an institution like ours governed in the&#13;
midst of our accountability being to political entities is to have a system that has--that's, first of&#13;
all, sufficiently complex that very few people can understand it and to make the claim that the&#13;
system yields a number.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: At least a reasonably objective number.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: An apparently ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Apparently reasonable.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: .. objective number, and the thing is that, you know, we argue about the, you know,&#13;
the way interpretations were made at different points, but there were two things that I was&#13;
convinced about from, you know, from '88 until the end of my time with the Staff Association,&#13;
and 1that is that we were dealing with people of very good will on the other side.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I was going to ask you, what was your impression of the other side? Were we dealt&#13;
with in good faith, generally?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Not only we were dealt with in good faith, it was--I really feel these were people of&#13;
good will. They cared about us. They were willing to share a lot of their personal perceptions&#13;
with us in a way that I've seen operate nowhere else in the Bank. And, you know, often we&#13;
learned about the mischief that was being made to accommodate politics directly from our&#13;
counterparts because the system was much too difficult for us to pore through it.&#13;
&#13;
But at the same time, you know, I feel as though our group was made up of people of good will.&#13;
We understood that politics was going to come into this somewhere. We didn't like it, okay, but&#13;
we also, we did understand, you know, where this was coming from, and ...&#13;
&#13;
So I felt that the ability to communicate in this circumstance was one of the highlights of my life.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I always felt that the major value of this Revised Compensation System was that it&#13;
succeeded in removing compensation issues out of the political realm, at least insofar as staff&#13;
was concerned. What I mean by that is it was perceived by staff at least as a reasonable method,&#13;
whereas before the Board was clearly playing politics.&#13;
&#13;
SOJPHER: Well, we went from a period from 1984 unti11988 where four out of those five years&#13;
we had to have staff demonstrations in the old courtyard in order to--as a byproduct of every&#13;
compensation increase.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And even back in the '70s, there were furious disagreements about compensation,&#13;
so controversy went on over at least a decade, at least.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Now, what the Revised Compensation system did was remove that.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Okay. And, you know, we were able to fight about other things, but we--we never&#13;
again had a courtyard demonstration over compensation.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So if for no other reason--you know, having served on the. Compensation Working&#13;
Group myself, it may sound self-serving, but I think that was the major contribution of this&#13;
system, that it removed compensation as being a contentious issue between staff and&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: I agree. I agree. But there was also--there were a couple ofbyproducts that were&#13;
good, Chuck. I mean, first of all, under the previous system that had been linked to inflation, we&#13;
had no idea what others were paying. Now we have a very vivid idea of what other ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Our comparators.&#13;
&#13;
SO F'HER: Yeah, others are paying for similar types of jobs. We also know where we deviate&#13;
and where we don't. And we also are able to draw on the dimension of pay where we have&#13;
recruitment issues. So, you know, there were a lot of things that were-that were good&#13;
byproducts of what amounted ~o being a system that worked.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The Revised Compensation System w~s superseded by another system some years&#13;
ago, but I don't believe that the old contentiousness has returned. Did you have any role in&#13;
fommlating this new system?&#13;
&#13;
SOI)HER: Well, I was Chair at the time, and, you know, we'll get into that, I guess, a little bit&#13;
later. But I feel as though it was the formulation and implementation of that new system that&#13;
reaHy ended my usefulness as Chair six months before the end of my term.&#13;
&#13;
What happened was that they put together the system. It was a good system. It relied on more&#13;
data points, you know, a broader set of comparators so that, you know, it could answer the&#13;
questions raised by the Board as to whether the system that we had in place, the RCS, was self-&#13;
serving. And what it went to prove is that, you know, when you're dealing in the statistical&#13;
situation, the difference between having thirty samples and a thousand samples is relatively&#13;
small.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So the new system was based in large measure on the old one ...&#13;
&#13;
SOJPHER: There were a lot of similar principles in play. The main difference between the new&#13;
and the old was the breadth of the comparators, the number of comparators, and also that--that&#13;
we were looking much more closely at job-to-job comparisons instead of pay line to pay line.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005 - Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  55&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now,, there was also another difference in terms of the RCS and the new one, and that was that&#13;
we no longer have an integrated pay line. What happened was that we were--we got data and we&#13;
aggn~gated the data for a given grade, but then what we did was we moved each grade so that the&#13;
pay line is not a continuous and consistent pay line. The market reference point, what we used to&#13;
refer to as the pay line, is a continuous line. But the tops and bottoms of grades no longer follow&#13;
a continuous line, so that you could have Grade G, for example, that increases--where the top&#13;
and bottom increase by 6 percent, but then Grade H, where they increase by 8, okay, whereas,&#13;
under the old system you couldn't do that.&#13;
&#13;
Now, what's happened is that pay in the Bank has now mirrored pay in the outside world where&#13;
there's a huge, a much larger disparity between the pay that the senior executives make and the&#13;
pay that the lowest people on the totem pole make. I remember when I first joined the&#13;
Compensation Working Group, I was overwhelmed to find that the vice presidential level&#13;
received only about 60 to 70 percent more pay than me, okay, even though there was a huge&#13;
disparity in our ranks, okay. And now, you know, between Level G or F, which is the entry level&#13;
for professionals, and, you know, Level K, there could be a differential of between 200 and 250&#13;
percent. So, I mean it is a much larger differential as a result of the fact that grades operate&#13;
independently.&#13;
&#13;
Now, what happened there? It's--first of all, I think very few people, including the current&#13;
Compensation Working Group, really understand how the system works. And frankly, since I've&#13;
retired, I don't participate, and I don't feel I should. I mean, this is no longer my bailiwick. But&#13;
what happened was that the year that we went from the old to the new, there was a political tidal&#13;
wave ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Excuse me. When you say from the old to the new, you mean from the Revised&#13;
Compensation System to its successor?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: To the new compensation system.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay, just to keep that clear.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: There was a political tidal wave that said we're paying too much. The early returns&#13;
on the application of the system called for a 6 percent increase. I remember that. I remember&#13;
hearing that very, very clearly.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: This was about 1999 or so?&#13;
&#13;
SOJPHER: This was in January '99, okay, and I remember after hearing this, going to the&#13;
Delegate Assembly and explaining that, you know, because of the new grading system, it&#13;
appears as if we're overpaid by 2 percent in general, but then that 2 percent will be offset by a 6&#13;
percent increase, so I was expecting a 4 percent increase that year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 56&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Some:where within the Bank's administration they came to the conclusion that we could never&#13;
sell a 4 percent increase to the Board. They would go ballistic. So what they did was they took a&#13;
slew of jobs that were in Level I and downgraded them to--sorry--yeah, a slew of jobs that were&#13;
in Level I that had good comparisons, downgraded them to Level H and didn't replace them. The&#13;
reference points for making these, the comparisons, is Level I and Level F. You anchor your pay&#13;
line through those two.&#13;
&#13;
So, in effect, some of the higher-paying jobs that would have raised Level I, okay, were taken&#13;
out of the comparison, put into areas where they were no longer to be compared, and then you&#13;
have a lower outcome for Level I. And that's how the 2 percent came about. I mean, it's a very&#13;
tough concept to try to e~plain, but in effect I knew very well what had been done and why we&#13;
got the 2 percent increase instead of the 6. And then if you look at the fact that we were overpaid&#13;
by 2 percent because of the comparator exercise, okay, then what was justified was a 0.7 percent&#13;
average increase for that year, and that was--I feel as though that really destroyed the morale in&#13;
the Bank for about a year, year and a half after that. Certainly it rendered me useless as a ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: As chair ...&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: .. an interlocutor with management because, you know, management loved me but&#13;
my own troops weren't willing to follow any more.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Let's stop.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Be~~in Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, Jamil, in 1987 the Bank underwent a significant reorganization, and from&#13;
your perspectives in both as a regular--as a staff member in Operations and from your perch in&#13;
the Staff Association, what were your views of that reorganization?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: I mean, it's been about 18 years since then, and I have yet to find a redeeming&#13;
feature to it. By any account, that reorganization was an absolute disaster. It was a disaster&#13;
because of the way it was launched, and it was a disaster because of the way it was implemented.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I think there's a lot of people who were at the Bank in the early '80s who agreed that the&#13;
Bank was having difficulty. It was--it was drifting. It didn't have the advantage of strong&#13;
leadership like, you know, it had in the '70s under McNamara and with Ernie Stern's help. But in&#13;
the early '80s, there were a lot of competing priorities. Nobody quite understood what resources&#13;
we did and didn't have. There was a raging argument about whether or not we were a bank or a&#13;
development institution. We used different words at the time; at the time it was: what came&#13;
first, country or projects?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
But--so there was a need for something. There was a need for something in order to focus our&#13;
activity a lot better and to enable us to do a better job.&#13;
&#13;
But what happened in '87? You had a new President who came in without any qualifications.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That's Barber Conable.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Barber Conable. He didn't know the development business. He got the job as a&#13;
result of his contacts with the Administration, which effectively gave a message to us that the&#13;
quality of our work didn't matter, it was who you knew.&#13;
&#13;
The second thing, he did do something that was relatively sensible in terms of putting together a&#13;
committee of something like thirty or forty people to really study the organization and figure out&#13;
how to rework it to make it more effective.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Robert McNamara was one of those people, too ...&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: No.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So something else, then.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: It was something else, because the thing that I remember very clearly was that the&#13;
forty or so people who were on that group were the youngest--among the youngest, most&#13;
ambitious people in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, yes. McNamara's group came after that.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: That's correct.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes, okay.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Now, it was amazing. These people went off into an area where nobody where they&#13;
were or what they were doing. They came up with an organization structure a few weeks later&#13;
which seemed to make sense. And then there was a cascading where first the executive levels&#13;
were appointed and then the director levels were appointed. And sure enough, virtually every&#13;
one of the forty who made up the group got a plum job. So, again, you know, it was a--there was&#13;
a message which was it's not what you do, it's who you know that counts around here.&#13;
&#13;
Then it came time to select in the staff. Effectively, you know, we were left to go and plead our&#13;
cas~~s to those who had been appointed managers so that we could get the jobs we wanted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Just to recap, once the reorganization was being implemented, staff were in effect&#13;
fired from top to bottom and the most senior people who were appointed by the President then&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
selected their own people and it went on from there. It was called the cascade effect, although I&#13;
called it the avalanche effect.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, you know, the thing is that a lot of people had different perceptions of what it&#13;
was. The reality was that we were all fired on June 30th and we came back in as rehires on July&#13;
1 but in a different organization. But in the meantime, you know, when it came time for each of&#13;
us to get selected in, there was the anxiety because we knew that on June 30th we were all going&#13;
to be fired. So the question was: which ones of us were going to be selected to come back?&#13;
&#13;
Now, the problem that you had was that most people knew that they had a 9 out of 10 chance of&#13;
being selected back in. Based more on rumor than hard information, it was fairly clear that the&#13;
Bank was going to cut between 8 and 10 percent, so--because that's what the U.S. was driving&#13;
for--so if you looked at in a positive way, your chances of getting re-selected were 90 to 92&#13;
percent. So that wasn't the thing that inspired fear among my colleagues in Operations. It was&#13;
what sort of a job were you going to get. Were you going to get a good one? And were you&#13;
going to get the one that you wanted? Were you going to get one where you had influence,&#13;
where you had the ability to select what you were going to work on? And we had a lot of&#13;
conflicting information on what the country departments would be like, what the technical&#13;
departments would be like, what would be the jobs within those departments, who would have&#13;
task management, and all the rest of that stuff that makes Bank work really interesting. So, in&#13;
effect, you were being asked to go and suck up to those who had been selected as director and&#13;
manager in order to get a job that hadn't really been fully formed, but that's where you thought&#13;
you'd be most happy.&#13;
&#13;
I was very lucky. I wound up in the department I wanted, with the director I wanted, with an&#13;
extremely good division chief, one that I had known before so I knew I wanted him, and still&#13;
there were the vagaries that it was only on July 1 when--sorry, it was July lOth, because July 1&#13;
they rebuilt MC [Main Complex] in order to house most of the ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: They realigned, physically realigned ...&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: .. office space, yeah. So July 1Oth was the first time we showed up as a unit, and&#13;
then we found out who was in our unit, and it was only then that we were able to come to an&#13;
impression about whether we'd be harmonious or not. And it wasn't all that easy because there&#13;
were a number of people in my unit who had been selected in from other units. I never knew&#13;
them before. It turned out that they were some awfully good people, so, as I said, I was very&#13;
luck-y because I wound up in one of the more harmonious units of the Bank, and I wound up with&#13;
a work program that I loved.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which unit was this, by the way? And who was the division chief? You spoke&#13;
well of him or her.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: All right. There was one Asia Vice Presidency following the reorganization, and the&#13;
Vice President was Attila Karaosmanoglu. I didn't, you know, enjoy him as a social&#13;
acquaintance, but he was a very, very good Vice President.&#13;
&#13;
My director was Gautam Kaji, and to this day I'd still go through a window for him. If he said,&#13;
"Jamil, do this," you know, I would do it because I believe in him that much as a wonderful&#13;
human being.&#13;
&#13;
My division chief was a guy named Inder Sud, and, you know, with Inder it was a case where I&#13;
went through some highs and lows, but I really attribute a lot of the good things that have&#13;
happened to me as having been set up because I got very good advice from Inder. And, you&#13;
know, to this day I still think of my management structure in that first job as having been truly&#13;
outstanding.&#13;
&#13;
But the part that I still remember--! remember it as if it were yesterday. You know, it was July&#13;
when we-when we reconstituted. I really felt as though as a unit we were back in business by&#13;
September. We knew what we were going to do. We knew what our projects were. I had some&#13;
background on some of them. There were some new ones, but they were good. I knew who I&#13;
was supposed to work with, who my teams were. I had a reporting relationship with a division&#13;
chief and Vice President that worked. I was fine. And I think most of the people in my unit&#13;
would say the same thing.&#13;
&#13;
We got to the Christmas party in December, and as--after we were there for an hour, my wife&#13;
pulled me aside. She said, you know, "I've got to get away from this for a few minutes. This is&#13;
mind-boggling."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What do you mean?"&#13;
&#13;
She said, "You know, I've been listening to you at dinner for the last three months or&#13;
thereabouts, and I had the idea that the Bank was business as usual. But there're an awful lot of&#13;
people that we're meeting here who are very, very upset about this reorganization, and that's the&#13;
only thing people can talk about. So I want to know before I go back into that room, which is the&#13;
truth?"&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And these are people not only from your division, it was a somewhat larger party&#13;
than just your division?&#13;
&#13;
SOJPHER: Oh, it was the entire Asia Region.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: And it included four other country departments.&#13;
conclude pretty quickly that there were two divisions in&#13;
comfortable, and nobody else did,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now to me, outside of that period of disruption, the reorganization would have been a non-event&#13;
except for one thing.&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: And this is to you personally.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: To me personally. And that is: what did it do to the Bank's culture? Up until that&#13;
point--and I think I mentioned this last week--up until that point you worked for a division chief&#13;
and there was a director in the picture, but you really worked for the Bank. Your loyalty was to&#13;
the institution. You did good work for the institution. There was an acknowledgment that&#13;
people will come and go, they'll move, you'll go to a different job, your managers will go to a&#13;
different job, but the thing that was the constant in your life was the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
 The "87 reorganization meant you owed your selection back in, you owed your good job to an&#13;
 individual who selected you. And generally speaking that was either the Vice President or the&#13;
 director because that person was the one who was-who oversaw a network. You were part of&#13;
 that person's network, and, by goodness, you--you owed your loyalty to that network. The Bank&#13;
Â·was--became a non-factor.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So the Bank almost became a feudal hierarchy in a way.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: It's exactly what happened. Now, what was--my loyalty, I felt from July 1, 1987,&#13;
untill I, you know, left the Asia Region and became Chair of the Staff Association, my loyalty all&#13;
through that was to Gautam Kaji. Gautam Kaji was the guy who selected me. He told me that&#13;
he selected me so I didn't need to worry, and, you know, that was a double-edged thing because&#13;
on the one hand I knew then I didn't need to worry but then I knew he was the godfather, don't&#13;
cross him, do exactly what he wants. And Inder was second in that chain. He was very, very&#13;
closely aligned with Gautam. And that was our network, and that's what we owed our loyalty to.&#13;
&#13;
Now, if you were lucky and you had a godfather who went up through the ranks and became a&#13;
Managing Director, you were going to do pretty well, especially if you remained tight with your&#13;
godfather. If you had a godfather who three years later was out in the next purge ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: There would be some more later on.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah, you were cast adrift, and that was the element of risk in this whole thing, and&#13;
that changed the Bank, I believe, irreparably, because I, you know, now I see a greater level of&#13;
cohesion than at any time since the late '80s. But they basically had to get rid of a whole lot--you&#13;
know, either through mandatory retirement or layoffs or packages, you name it--a whole lot of&#13;
people who came in in the late '80s, early 1990s, you know, who were able only to function&#13;
within this kind of feudal culture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18,2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                61&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So you would say on the whole that the 1987 reorganization was not in the best&#13;
inten~sts of the Bank in the way it turned out.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: You know, it's very hard to answer that because, you know, the question is what's&#13;
your time frame. I believe that after the 1987 reorganization, if you were going to have a U.S.&#13;
President like Bill [William J.] Clinton, it became inevitable that you would have a President like&#13;
Jim Wolfensohn. And I really do think that Jim Wolfensohn was a very, very good event for the&#13;
Banlc So, you know, whether it was because the '87 reorganization made it necessary for us to&#13;
have a President of that quality or not, I don't know. But what I do know is that the Bank from&#13;
'87 to '96 was not a place where I was ready to recommend to other people that they work. I&#13;
didn't like it, and, you know, one of the things about the culture during that time, the only way&#13;
you were ever going to get promoted was to get noticed because, you know, you were in very,&#13;
very tight with your feudal network but, you know, it might not be their time, and, you know,&#13;
there: were other people who were tight with the godfather, so you know ...&#13;
&#13;
So to make the case for getting promoted or recognized or moving into something really good,&#13;
you had to be noticed. What was the easiest way of getting noticed? Criticize. And, of course,&#13;
now there were all these reviewer, peer reviewer and other types of reviewer functions, so the&#13;
idea became if you could really criticize and be very strident about it, okay, you'd get noticed.&#13;
And I watched grown people reduce task managers to tears because they were trying to score&#13;
points at their expense. That was the culture that was spawned by 1987. I'm really glad that, you&#13;
know, that's behind us.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, this may be a good time to get into this question of institutional culture.&#13;
During your chairmanship--although I know you've always had an interest in the question of&#13;
institutional culture--but during your chairmanship especially, you frequently addressed the&#13;
matter of institutional culture. What were the salient characteristics of this culture? How did&#13;
you see the institutional culture evolve during your career in the Bank? And do you think it has&#13;
evolved in a more positive direction lately? Now, again you touched on this to some extent, but&#13;
here we're looking at it from the perspective of your entire career.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: If I look at it from the point of view of my contribution to the institution, I feel as&#13;
though this is an area where I've done a lot of good. And I feel as though the good that I've done&#13;
started before my chairmanship because I developed an ability to talk to Jim W olfensohn. Yes, it&#13;
was on the fly, but ...&#13;
&#13;
Now, there was one time in 1996--Jim got to know me because I gave the staff reaction to the&#13;
compensation increase at the Board in 1996.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: This is when you were co-chair of the Compensation Working Group?&#13;
&#13;
SOJPHER: I was co-chair, but Fred [Frederick W.] Wright and I went.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And he was Chairman at the time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  62&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: He was Chairman of the Association. And the thing was that the strategy that we&#13;
had taken, Chris and !--Chris Parel and I did not agree. But Fred backed it and ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Excuse me. What was that strategy, in a nutshell?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Up until then, the way we had always approached the issue of the Board was: "It's&#13;
not enough. You know, you've overlooked this, you've overlooked that, you've overlooked that;&#13;
this 4 percent that you're giving us is really pretty measly, and, you know, we thillk we ought to&#13;
get more."&#13;
&#13;
In 1996, Jim W olfensohn was the new President. He was beset on every front at that point. And&#13;
it was also clear that for us to go in and say, "This isn't enough," when it was a 4 percent increase&#13;
and we'd been expecting less was going to be very disadvantageous. First of all, I felt that he&#13;
would simply look at us as being a bunch of querulous critics, not worth his time, and the second&#13;
thing was that we weren't going to get more anyway. I mean, it was--the political environment&#13;
was very negative. Nobody really wanted to give us the 4 percent except that that was what the&#13;
system showed.     e&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So Chris wanted to do things the old way, and our counterparts in Personnel said, "Look, your&#13;
strategy should be go in there asking for more. That's the only way we'll be able to hold the line&#13;
on our 4 percent."&#13;
&#13;
I had-I thought about it differently, and I discussed it with Fred, and I said, "Look, this is a time&#13;
when everyone is beating up on W olfensohn because they all want something from him. If we&#13;
go into the Board and, "We say we will accept the 4 percent, okay; we think that there's cause to&#13;
give us more but we're not going to ask you for more because this is a time of shared sacrifice&#13;
within the Bank, but we are going to ask you for something, and that is partnership, okay. We&#13;
want you to think of us as partners that you want to deal with; we want you to discuss decisions&#13;
with us, and we'll hold you accountable that you do things in the interest of the institution. W we&#13;
believe that a strong institution should strengthen the staff, and in tum you're not going to get a&#13;
strong institution if you have a weak staff, okay, so our interests are aligned and we want&#13;
partnership. And, incidentally, since we're here to talk about compensation, we accept your&#13;
offer.'"&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: By the by.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah. Anyway, that was a real departure from what we normally did, and what I&#13;
remember was the Executive Committee was very divided over this. The one I remember on the&#13;
Executive Committee that year was Pauline [Griller-Mitchell], because I really liked Pauline.&#13;
For me, she was a bellwether of the constituency she represented. And she was outraged when ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, she was support level staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Jamil Sopher&#13;
                       September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  63&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I remember Pauline, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Good person. Very, very good person.&#13;
&#13;
And I remember that Fred brought me in to make this proposal, that this was the way we were&#13;
going to write the speech. And Pauline raised her hand, got the floor, couldn't speak for a minute&#13;
or two, and then she said, "I'm sorry. I'm just outraged at this. How can you propose to do that?"&#13;
And, you know, we laid it out, and I think the Executive Committee voted 6 to 3 in favor of&#13;
doing it this way.&#13;
&#13;
But Bill [William T.] Onorato; who--I didn't know him very well at that point, but later he and I&#13;
have become very, very close friends ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He was a lawyer in the Legal Department.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I remember Bill.&#13;
&#13;
SOP'HER: He's now the guardian to my kids, so it puts in perspective where--how friendships&#13;
can develop. If something should happen to me and my wife, he's the one who will deal with&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
But in any case, Bill decided to attach a string to this. He proposed that Fred not give the speech;&#13;
Fred go to the Board, I give the speech. And his contention was plausible deniability. If there's&#13;
a big backlash from the staff, then Fred can say, you know, "It's him."&#13;
&#13;
We went to the Board. Fred was given the floor. He invited me to make the statement. By the&#13;
time I finished, you could have heard a pin drop in the Board room. And then finally&#13;
W olfensohn broke the silence, and he said, "That's remarkable. Do you have a copy of that&#13;
stat~::ment? I want to show it to Elaine." And he shook our hands. He said, "Really, this is the&#13;
first interest group that's come up and said, 'I want to work with you.' Well, rest assured you're&#13;
going to get your partnership. We're going to work together."&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: So, you know, I mean it was clear that--that Wolfensohn himself was incredibly&#13;
pleased with this tum of events. I think, you know, we basically with that speech secured the 4&#13;
percent increase. Jan Piercy and two or three other EDs [Executive Directors] ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Jan Piercy was the U.S. Executive Director.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   64&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah... commented before we left the room about, you know, what a wonderful&#13;
statement the Staff Association has made, how it would bode very well for the institution, et&#13;
cetera, I mean, it was--and then Fred and I were invited out of the room, as was normal in these&#13;
discussions. And we went into the Board sitting room, and both of us just didn't want to leave. I&#13;
mean, we realized that we had created a triumph right there at the Board room. You know, we&#13;
didn't-we didn't need further evidence of it. We knew this had been a major success. What we&#13;
didn't know was how our constituents would react, but at least when it came to our discussions&#13;
with senior management, we had been in one swoop elevated by about four steps.&#13;
&#13;
And then about three hours later, I was sitting in my office, and I received this. Now, I was ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, I'll read it out. It's a letter from President Wolfensohn to Mr. Jamil Sopher,&#13;
"From the Board meeting," it says in Wolfensohn's handwriting. And then it's typed, and it says,&#13;
"I would like to thank you for the extremely thoughtful statement that you and Fred made at the&#13;
Board meeting this morning. I am fully committed to the spirit of partnership between&#13;
management and staff, and I welcome the opportunity to work with the Staff Association in&#13;
creating a culture of excellence and effectiveness at the Bank. I greatly appreciate your support.&#13;
Sincerely yours"--but that's crossed out, and it says, "Warmly, Jim Wolfensohn." And again in&#13;
Mr. Wolfensohn's handwriting, "Your statement really gave me great encouragement to move&#13;
forward. I am most grateful to you. J.D.W."&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: And Fred ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: It's dated, by the way, it's dated Aprilll, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Now, the thing is Fred received something similar, but with a different handwritten&#13;
message, obviously.&#13;
&#13;
We went public with this. We went to the constituents, and in large part it was, at least based on&#13;
my e-mails, it was treated as a non-event. People were, you know, happy to get their 4 percent.&#13;
The general reaction that I heard was, "Well, it's not very much, but then in this environment it's&#13;
good so we're happy."&#13;
&#13;
And so that was the way that this progressed, but what changed, and changed in a flash, was the&#13;
way that both Jim Wolfensohn and Sven Sandstrom treated us from that point on.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And Sven Sandstrom was the Managing Director, one of the Managing Directors at&#13;
that time.&#13;
&#13;
SOJPHER: He was the one who oversaw staff relations.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: HR and that sort of thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There were some things going on in the HR Department. Every time a major decision, including&#13;
the decision to bring in Richard Stem as Deputy Vice President, was made, Fred and I would get&#13;
called, invited to talk to Sven, and I wasn't even a member of the Executive Committee but, you&#13;
know, I was held in that level of appreciation.&#13;
&#13;
The part that I didn't expect was that Jim would recognize me. And Jim was a President who&#13;
loved to walk around, and, you know, when he would see people he knew, he tended to stop and&#13;
chat. And, I mean I was taken aback on a number of occasions when he recognized me from,&#13;
you know, from reasonably far and came to say hello, to chat, to ask how I was doing. He was&#13;
very interested when he found out I was a financial analyst to get a sense of what was the state of&#13;
financial analysis in the Bank. And then at one luncheon where Jim had invited the Staff&#13;
Association Executive Committee to lunch with him and I was invited along, he specifically&#13;
asked me if I would put together a memo on just that topic.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: As I recall, I was there at that meeting. I was on the EC at the time.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Yeah. So, you know, there came a personal relationship along with this. Now, I'm&#13;
not going to suggest for a moment that I was one of Jim's good friends, but I think Jim&#13;
recognized that we could talk and we could do business together. And I still think of him in a&#13;
major way.&#13;
&#13;
Now, in '96--this was before I even ran for Executive Committee--when Jim saw me one&#13;
afternoon in November, he said, "I have a few minutes. You want to have a beer together?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Yeah!"&#13;
&#13;
Now, Chuck, you know me. That's probably the only beer I ever drank in my 27 years at the&#13;
World Bank. I like wine, but beer wasn't my thing.&#13;
&#13;
I went up to Jim's office, and he pulled out a stash of Foster's and handed me one. And then he&#13;
started asking me things. He said, "You know, you've said to me several times that this place is&#13;
in need of reform. What is the thing that needs reform most, in your opinion?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "The Bank's culture." I said, ''You know, we have descended to the point where we&#13;
can't--in certain situations we can't even be civil to one another. It is a dog-eat-dog environment&#13;
where we're all trying to score points at the expense of somebody else. And this has to change. I&#13;
can't--I'm not going to stay here if it continues to be this way because I like to do things in&#13;
harmony."&#13;
&#13;
Several months later, Jim ran into me again, and he said, "You know, I understand that this is&#13;
Fred's last term. Are you going to succeed him?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2 and 9 and November 18,2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  66&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
By then I was already a member ofthe--I had run for Second Vice Chair and was a member of&#13;
the EC. I said, "Well, I really wasn't thinking about it."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Man, the only way that we're going to make a change in the culture is with leadership&#13;
on your side, and you're the only one who has talked to me about that."&#13;
&#13;
And I took that as an invitation that I ought to run. So, you know--but the thing was that he&#13;
remembered throughout my time as Chair the fact that I felt that the culture was really the&#13;
problem. And I think from his point of view there was another dimension to it, which is that&#13;
whenever he would speak to regular Bank operations people, you know, about what needs to be&#13;
changed, he'd get some sort of a technical answer or something that was economics, and, you&#13;
know, not many people would sit down and say to him, "No, we have to change behavior." We&#13;
wouldn't even talk about behavior in those days. So ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, there are some who would say that you were perhaps too close to&#13;
Wolfensohn, especially during your time as Chairman. How would you respond to that&#13;
statement?&#13;
&#13;
SOP'HER: Well, I've often wondered the same thing, but, you know, to quote Donald [H.]&#13;
Rumsfeld, "You lead your life with the personality you have, not the personality you want." And&#13;
I may be willing to hang in and hang in hard on professional matters that I believe in very&#13;
strongly, but I'm not a confrontational person, person to person. I like people. I like the people&#13;
that I work with. And what I carne to understand about Jim Wolfensohn--because there were a&#13;
lot of similarities between him and my father--is that this is a person who needed a lot of&#13;
reassurance as you were dealing with him. He needed to keep believing that you liked him if he&#13;
was going to be dealing.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: On a personal level.&#13;
&#13;
SOIâ&#128;¢HER: On a personal level. And the truth of it was I did like him. I liked him a lot. And&#13;
so, I mean, it was--it would be hard for me to do things differently. I did disagree with him a lot,&#13;
okay. I also carne ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Explicitly with him, during discussions with him?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah. But I also knew that I couldn't disagree with him in public. That would be,&#13;
you know, an act of disloyalty. So when I would disagree with him was in private, one-on-one&#13;
times when I would sit down and there was nobody else around to hear me dressing down the big&#13;
guy or to hear him corning back at me.&#13;
&#13;
There was one time when I told him, "You know, I have to disagree with you. I have to go&#13;
public with our disagreement."&#13;

                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  67&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, you got to do what you got to do. You were elected by a different constituency."&#13;
He said, "But I appreciate a lot the fact that you've told me ahead of time, so now I can anticipate&#13;
it."&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, there were some other things. There was one particular issue of the Staff&#13;
Association newsletter where we were very critical of senior management. This was in April of&#13;
1998. He called me in; he beat me up over that. And then, you know, as I was about to retreat,&#13;
you know, thinking that, "Well, you know, maybe I'm going to resign now. After all, I didn't&#13;
come into this job to make people miserable," he phoned me, and he said, "Look," he said, "I&#13;
don't want you leaving my office with the wrong idea. You have to do your job. Just let me&#13;
know that these things are coming ahead of time."&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, that was a very important piece, because we had a reception later that afternoon,&#13;
and my job at the reception was to introduce him, and, you know, I was really left shattered by&#13;
the earlier meeting. And when he called me to essentially take me off the hook, then I was able&#13;
to proceed with the rest of my day pretty well.&#13;
&#13;
In the same way that I don't like, you know, administering a lot of personal criticism, I don't like&#13;
receiving criticism that's personal. I can take any amount of it that's clearly professional, but&#13;
personal is very, very hard. And, you know, so here again I appreciated that Jim treated me by&#13;
the same set of rules that he expected me to treat him, so ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yeah. You did mention President Clausen, as we're talking about Presidents now.&#13;
Were there any other Presidents that you dealt with besides Wolfensohn? Obviously, the others&#13;
wouldn't have been on such a close basis, but I'm just wondering if you had any reactions to any&#13;
of the other Presidents who were at the Bank the same time you were.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, there were essentially 2 others, although one of them will surprise you. Lew&#13;
[Lewis T.] Preston, as a person who was very close to David Delmonte ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Who was a Chairman of the Staff Association.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah. David took me to several of his meetings with Lew Preston, and I found him&#13;
to be a very warm and engaging person, but I also found him disengaged from the Bank. So, you&#13;
know, I--Lew Preston was the sort of guy that I would love to invite to a garden party. I'm not&#13;
sure I'd want to invite Jim Wolfensohn to a garden party, but Lew Preston I certainly would. But&#13;
I don't put Lew in anywhere near the category that I put Jim. I still--you know, I put Jim on a&#13;
pedestal at this point because, I mean, I think he's one of the giants of our time.&#13;
&#13;
The other President, surprisingly, is that I was a classmate of Paul [D.] Wolfowitz. I had one&#13;
class with him that I remember.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, when you say with him, was he your teacher or was he a fellow student?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  68&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: No, he was a fellow student. He was Cornell Class of '65 and so am I. And we were&#13;
in an advanced math class. Paul was a math major. I was an engineer who was struggling. And&#13;
there was no question as to who was the smartest kid in the class. There was also ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And it wasn't you. [Laughter.]&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: It was definitely not me. And there was also no question that he knew he was the&#13;
smartest one in the class. And, you know, so I wonder to what extent that side of Paul&#13;
Wolfowitz will come out. We'll find out in coming months.&#13;
&#13;
But what I found during the time that I was leading the Staff Association was that the hardest&#13;
part of my job was managing the relationship with Jim Wolfensohn. I'm a real believer in one&#13;
thing, Chuck, and that is that the Staff Association--because you've got an attitude within the&#13;
staff that they belong first to the World Bank and then to the Staff Association a distant second,&#13;
that they like it when the Staff Association, you know, picks up the fight on their behalf, but they&#13;
ain't going to follow. If we wanted to have a job action, forget it. They wouldn't be there, okay;&#13;
they wouldn't walk off the job. They might have a slowdown, work-to-rule for one day, but&#13;
that's about as far as they would go. And, you know, it would be a major event that would cause&#13;
a slowdown, work-to-rule for one day, so, you know, you just weren't going to get that kind of&#13;
identification from the staff.&#13;
&#13;
So that being the case, I came to the conclusion that my ultimate weapon, the thing that would&#13;
have to carry us in whatever battles we engaged with management, was my ability to sell. I had&#13;
nothing else. You know, I talked for the staff, but I didn't have the kind of support that would be&#13;
necessary for anybody to live in fear of me. But if I made good points, they recognized it. And I&#13;
had a good enough set of personal relationships. I had known Sven Sandstrom long before I had&#13;
this job. I'd known Richard Stem very well for many, many years. I'd known Anil Sood. I'd&#13;
known Mark Baird. I'd known, you know, a number ofthe Vice Presidents, so that I enjoyed a&#13;
high degree of personal respect, and I also knew that I was a capable seller. And that's what I&#13;
had going for me.&#13;
&#13;
ZIE,GLER: Well, building on this, Jamil, you've spoken to me about tension between the roles&#13;
of leadership and representation for the Chairman of the Staff Association in dealing with&#13;
management. Is this along the lines of ...&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Very much so. See, the thing is that you get into almost any dealing over almost&#13;
anything if you have a very good sense of what the power relationships are, what they consider&#13;
to be important, what you consider to be important, what's real, what's not real, okay, you can&#13;
develop a pretty good idea of what the outcome's going to be pretty early in the game. So you&#13;
know what you're going to win and you know what you're going to lose.&#13;
&#13;
Now, ifthere's a lot of reform going on at one time--which there was during my chairmanship ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  69&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And we'll discuss that in some detail.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah, yeah. You know you're going to lose far more than you're going to win, okay.&#13;
And you also know that you got to talk to your constituents.&#13;
&#13;
Now, what struck me is at what point do my public statements aim to give voice to their&#13;
anxi~~ties and to what extent should my public statements aim to educate that this is the best we&#13;
can dlo in the current environment. If I'm giving voice to their anxieties, I'm representing them,&#13;
okay. This is not leadership. This is a case of allowing the people who voted for me or who&#13;
were behind those who voted for me to hear me talk and express their angst. When I come out&#13;
and I say, you know, "This is the deal we got, and this is the--what you wanted, so we fell far&#13;
short, and, you know, under the circumstances I'm not happy but I'm not going to lead us on a&#13;
job action," that's leading.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which isn't going to succeed anyway.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: That's right. That's leading because, in effect, I'm saying, "Accept this. Okay, I did&#13;
the best I can, accept this, let's move on. And, incidentally, this is why management has decided&#13;
to do it, and this is--and, you know, here's the reason why this is not such a bad thing or why it's&#13;
pretty good."&#13;
&#13;
I want to give you one example, because it's an example where I got myself into a certain amount&#13;
oftrouble with my constituents, but, you know, that came with the territory.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Before you start it, let me just change the tape. Okay, Jamil?&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: All right.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: You know I was going to relate to you this example of leadership and representation.&#13;
&#13;
In about mid-1998, the Bank started a project to reconfigure people's offices which effectively&#13;
reduced the size of people's work space by about 20 percent. The objective ofthis exercise was&#13;
to get us out of leased space, and by getting out of leases we would save about $19 million a&#13;
year.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I got to tell you I did not like the notion that the offices were becoming smaller. In a place&#13;
like the World Bank where, you know, all you get is your salary and the increase that comes with&#13;
it--there are no substantial bonuses, there are no substantial incentive plans, there's no profit&#13;
sharing, nothing else--you know, it's a lot of ego things that separate, you know, one staff&#13;
member from his or her neighbor. And, you know, size of office is one of them. Number of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2 and 9 and November 18,2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    70&#13;
&#13;
windows is another one. You know, this is small stuff, but these are the perks that people live&#13;
for.&#13;
&#13;
But very quickly I could see what the budget imperatives were. We had the Strategic Compact.&#13;
We were going to need to go back to pre-Compact levels of funding after the Compact period&#13;
was tinished. We had to find ways of saving money. There was no two ways about it.&#13;
&#13;
So I 1look a two-pronged approach to this question about staff offices. One was to work very&#13;
closely with GSD [General Services Department] in order that the offices be designed to be&#13;
attractive, to be functional, and so that the space that remaiped would be efficient. And the other&#13;
one was to say very little in public about it because I tigured it was a no-win issue.&#13;
&#13;
There was one large meeting that I had at East Asia. I was delegate from East Asia ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You were a delegate, not Chairman at this time.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: No, I was Chairman, but I was the East Asia delegate. So, you know, Jean-Michel&#13;
Severino had me come back occasionally to participate in his town hall meetings and speak at his&#13;
town hall meetings. And somebody raised a question of me in that meeting, you know, "Why&#13;
wasn't the Staff Association bellyaching about the-about the reduction in offices?"&#13;
&#13;
And I explained that, "You know, there's a dilemma involved here, because, you know, there's&#13;
$19 million that we can save by getting rid ofleases. Now, ifwe don't save it this way, who are&#13;
we going to fire to save that $19 million, because sooner or later, if you're cutting a program,&#13;
you're firing people. If you're going to do almost anything else, you're going to fire people. And&#13;
the majority of the $19 million was going to have to come from people being fired."&#13;
&#13;
After the meeting, one of my very good friends in the Bank, still one of my very good friends, a&#13;
gentleman named [Robert] Van Pulley, who ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He is the head ofGSD.&#13;
&#13;
SOli&gt;HER: .. who's currently head of GSD. Van pulled me aside and he said, "You know, I&#13;
really appreciate what you're doing, and I also very much appreciated that the answer that you&#13;
gave on the issue ofthe offices." Now, Van at the time was chief administrative officer for the&#13;
East Asia Region, so, you know, this fell right into his bailiwick. He said, "But I have one real&#13;
problem with your answer."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What's that, Van?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "That answer should have come from Shengman Zhang and not you."&#13;
&#13;
Okay. Now, that in a nutshell illustrates the dilemma between leadership and representation,&#13;
okay. Somebody's got to lead. Somebody has to help get the mass of the population to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    71&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
understand why some of these decisions are being made and why even things that appear to be&#13;
pretty bad are not necessarily against their best interest. But the question that I got more than&#13;
"Are you too close to management?" was "Why you are you the one who's leading and not&#13;
them?"&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: One thing in your answers, too, I want to make clear for whoever uses this&#13;
trans,cript ultimately--and this is something that I think staff doesn't even really take on board--&#13;
and that is that the Staff Association's role is that of being consulted. In other words, it has no&#13;
formal power. The Staff Rules say only that management must consult with the Staff&#13;
Association, and as we both know, Jamil, consultation can take many forms, can be very&#13;
perfunctory or it can be detailed. We've been through that, also. So anybody who wants to&#13;
understand the dynamics of this relationship really has to understand the Staff Association is just&#13;
a consultative body with no real power in a formal sense, and this is important.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: See, Chuck, the thing--I don't think I would have ever run for Executive Committee&#13;
if we had formal power because, you know, I would much rather use whatever position I have to&#13;
improve the lot of people within the system in an amicable way, forging consensus, bringing&#13;
people on board, selling. My favorite words at the time were "being relentless and boring."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In meetings with our management counterparts.&#13;
&#13;
SOFUER: Yeah. But then to turn around and say, "Ifyou don't do what I'm asking you to do,&#13;
I'm going to sue you or I'm going to beat you up," or whatever--to me, the fact of being able to&#13;
change and improve through the system is much, much more important than wielding power per&#13;
se.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: One issue that came up during President Wolfensohn's time at the Bank--well, in&#13;
1997 the staff attitude survey showed that staff supported the Bank and its goals but that staff did&#13;
not trust senior management. And let's note that this is early in W olfensohn's time at the Bank.&#13;
Wolfensohn was so concerned by this perceived lack of trust that he specifically referred to it&#13;
soon after in one of his town meetings.&#13;
&#13;
You somewhat touched on this earlier on, but in a more comprehensive sense, how did you see&#13;
this issue of trust specifically, not between the Staff Association and management but between&#13;
staff generally and management of the institution?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: I think you could also say between staff and staff. I mean, I think one has to put&#13;
himself in the context of the time. In 1996-97 we had ten years of the culture that was launched&#13;
by the '87 reorganization. It was--as I think we've said several times in this conversation--it was&#13;
very much a feudal culture. All of a sudden in 1995 Wolfensohn comes in, and the thing that&#13;
he's announced his desire to do is to break down some of these feudal powers and create a strong&#13;
central executive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    72&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A lot of people in the Bank behave as if there's a strong central executive, but, you know, their&#13;
own power is pretty unchecked. I know that we lost several of the MDs [Managing Directors] in&#13;
the first couple years of Jim Wolfensohn because they didn't want to give up their power. That's&#13;
what he was getting at. Wolft:nsohn gave the glass wall speech as a way of saying, "You know,&#13;
guys,, you know, I can talk to you all you want, but nobody is willing to listen to me, nobody is&#13;
willing to give me half a moment, and I'm the only one in this room who's been elected."&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, from his point of view, it was very frustrating, but in this struggle between&#13;
Wolfensohn and the managers, okay, staffwere left with incredible confusion. One bit of&#13;
confusion was that they didn't know who was going to win, whether it was going to be Jim or&#13;
whether it was going to be what I used to refer to as the "we bes," you know: "We be here before&#13;
you got here and we be here after you leave." You know, the managers early on decided they&#13;
were going to wait him out, let him become powerless, and then once they achieved that, it&#13;
wou]i,d be business as usual.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Become frustrated. He would say sometimes, "Well, you know, I can just ditch this&#13;
whole thing and go fishing." And he could have, too.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Yeah. But, I mean, the point was that there was this element of confusion. You&#13;
didn't know who was going to win, okay, so you didn't know which way to pitch your loyalty&#13;
because you were no longer loyal to the monolith of the Bank. You had a godfather. When I&#13;
became Staff Association Chair, one of the real difficult issues for me personally was&#13;
transferring my loyalty from Gautam Kaji to Jim Wolfensohn, you know, both of whom I&#13;
respected a lot, and I came to realize they were dramatically different in terms of the way they&#13;
saw the institution.&#13;
&#13;
The second thing is that in the absence of clarity about who was going to win and how all of this&#13;
was going to happen, there was an additional issue that needed to be thought through, and that is&#13;
what behavior was going to wind up scoring points for you. I mean, you couldn't suspend your&#13;
ambitions because the clock was running. People were getting promoted; people were getting&#13;
laid off--you name it--on a continuous basis. So the thing that took place is that the discussion&#13;
within the Bank was getting shriller and shriller, criticism was getting shriller and shriller, and it&#13;
really wasn't until about mid-1996 that the tone within the institution began to subside.&#13;
&#13;
Now, where does that leave staff when you take an attitude survey? First of all, it's very hard not&#13;
to really buy into the mission of the Bank. If you're going to be there more than two or three&#13;
years, you have to really be committed to what the institution is doing; otherwise, you're putting&#13;
in very long hours with--yeah, with a comfortable salary but, you know, chances of advancement&#13;
that are modest. And, you know, and for what? What drove me was that, you know, there were&#13;
people out there in some of the borrowing countries that really needed what we were doing.&#13;
And, you know, so that was a very satisfying element of it. At the same time, you know, this&#13;
interpersonal behavior that was going on within the institution, first between management and&#13;
staff and then between staff members on the job, was really bad. So it's no wonder that you had&#13;
this outcome.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      September 2 and 9 and November 18,2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 73&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And 1 remember in a subsequent discussion I had with Jim where he was the one who said, "This&#13;
tt~lls&#13;
    you, this set of answers here," and he pulled out a list of them.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: From the attitude survey?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: From the attitude survey. He said, "This supports your conclusion that we've got to&#13;
change the culture."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, Jamil, I know you have to leave in a little bit, so let me just ask a wind-up&#13;
question, a little bit different. You have mentioned some of the Presidents, but you only&#13;
mentioned Clausen briefly. And what about Conable? Did you have any relation with them or&#13;
any impressions of them, you know, given an institutional perspective?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, this will, 1 guess, surprise you a little bit, but Conable is the only Bank&#13;
President I ever voted for. When I was at Cornell, his district included Cornell. And he was a&#13;
very good Congressman, and I voted for him. Now in 1970 with the new census, there was a&#13;
certain gerrymandering and he remained a member of Congress, but, you know, I voted for him.&#13;
That said, I never had the idea that he was in control.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In the Bank as President.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Yeah. I had the idea that when it came to internal things that he had delegated&#13;
control mainly to [Moeen A.] Qureshi and in part to [Edward V.K.] Kim Jaycox, who was the&#13;
first among equals among the Vice Presidents, the Regional Vice Presidents. And from a more&#13;
macro point of view, he had abdicated control to the people at [U.S.] Treasury who were&#13;
overseeing him. They didn't like Ernie Stern, so, you know, the '87 reorganization sidelined&#13;
Ernie Stern. So, I mean, I didn't really--! didn't really think ofConable as "the President."&#13;
During that time, you know, what was important--the people who I saw as the ultimate powers&#13;
were Karaosmanoglu, who was my Vice President; Kaji, who was my director; and the President&#13;
became a factor again--actually, the President's office became a factor again in '92 when Ernie&#13;
Stern came back as Managing Director overseeing Operations.&#13;
&#13;
ZIE:GLER: He had been switched to Finance VP.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Finance, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yeah. What about Clausen? You've made a few references to him.&#13;
&#13;
SOJPHER: Well, you know, the thing was that there's a common thread between Clausen,&#13;
Conable and Preston, and that was that none ofthem really felt they could control this&#13;
organization, so they kind of retired to this, you know--to an area Neverland in the sky. They&#13;

Now, you know, I remember McNamara at the Board. A Board member would ask a question;&#13;
McNamara would not let you reply until he had rephrased the question in a way that you ought to&#13;
be able to answer.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, this is when you're at the Board presenting a project?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Or anything else, for that matter.&#13;
&#13;
Clausen, you know, he'd get a question, and he'd tum to the staff member, and he'd say, "So what&#13;
do you think about that?"&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Very different, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Very different. I mean, basically you were on your own. The President was notÂ·&#13;
going to help you. And for that reason the President was also not going to maintain a structure of&#13;
the debate with the Board, which was really--and the debate with the owners. So sometimes, you&#13;
know, especially during the Conable period, you could find yourself, you know, in the water up&#13;
to your neck with nobody providing any guidance because, you know, you had owner countries&#13;
that were very upset with you for one reason or another, usually over procurement.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay. At this point then, we will wind this interview up and take it up in your final&#13;
interview next time. Thank you, Jamil.&#13;

ZIEGLER: Today is November 18,2005. My name is Charles [Chuck] Ziegler. I am a&#13;
consultant with the World Bank Oral History Program. I'm at the home of Jamil Sopher to&#13;
conduct the final session of his oral history interviews.&#13;
&#13;
So, I'm glad to be here today, Jamil. Thank you for having me into your home, and I think you&#13;
want to start out with a little more about the Staff Association.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Thanks a lot for coming. Chuck, what I wanted to do was start by relating three&#13;
anecdotes of things that happened that, you know, affected me while I was at the Bank. Two of&#13;
them happened before my Staff Association period and one of them happened in the first year&#13;
that I was at the-as Staff Association Chair, but they really were very formative events in terms&#13;
of the way I thought about the institution. And I figured let me lay them out and then that way&#13;
they can be a point of reference.&#13;
&#13;
The first one happened in 1991. I had--we called them at the time secretaries; they are now&#13;
called assistants, but I was working with one who--she wasn't exceptionally talented, but she was&#13;
a very pleasant person, and she got the work done and she got it done on time. One day&#13;
Personnel came to her desk and asked if they could speak to her privately. She was very&#13;
uncomfortable about this, and I indicated that I was the Staff Association rep for our region and&#13;
that on that basis I would sit with her, and she was very happy about this. In any case, Personnel,&#13;
you know, essentially said to her that her brother had applied for employment at the Bank. He&#13;
was an alternative energy expert, which the Bank seriously needed. She was merely a secretary,&#13;
so would she resign?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Just like that?&#13;
&#13;
SOlflHER: Yeah, and, you know, they were prepared maybe to sweeten it by giving her a&#13;
package, you know, a year or 18 months, goodness knows what. Now, she didn't want to resign.&#13;
She also didn't particularly like that brother. I mean, that's a different issue. I stepped in, and I&#13;
told Personnel that I thought that they were totally out of line with this and that, you know, being&#13;
there was half the battle, possession being, you know ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Nine-tenths ofthe law, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: They approached her again, and again she said no. Partly it was because she knew&#13;
that she had my full backing. She also had our division chiefs full backing so, you know, she&#13;
felt as though she wasn't sticking her neck out inappropriately. And in the end the brother was&#13;
never hired.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  76&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  One of the things that this made me do was really think about the nepotism rules and, you know,&#13;
  this was one of the reasons why later when it came up in the Bank I felt that, you know, the Bank&#13;
  should be able to accommodate brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces and that type of thing,&#13;
Â· as long as they weren't in the same discipline and as long as they weren't in a position to overlap&#13;
  with one another, particularly if critical skills were involved.&#13;
&#13;
 The second episode occurred in 1996. At that time, I was task manager for the Nam Theun&#13;
 project, but I was also acting division chief for a period over my division. The real division chief&#13;
 had made a decision that for the Nam Theun project, which was really taking up a lot of our time&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: That's Nam Theun II?&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: Nam Theun II.&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: Uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: The one that took about twenty years to hatch. What we wanted to do was to hire&#13;
 not an assistant-level but an analyst-level person. And we had a slot, and, you know, what we&#13;
 wanted to do was get somebody straight out of Harvard Business School or something similar so&#13;
 that we knew that the individual would be very intelligent and very hard-working, but at the&#13;
 same time, you know, would be able to spend a lot of time drafting, responding to external&#13;
 forces, you name it.&#13;
&#13;
 I called Harvard Business School. They sent me three resumes. I interviewed the three. There&#13;
 was one who was especially interesting, a young man oflndian origin, and--but, you know, a&#13;
 terrific, terrific writer in English. So I asked him what he wanted in terms of money, and he said,&#13;
 you know, very, very sheepishly, "Well, you know, ifl could get this job, I'd really like $50,000&#13;
 a year."&#13;
&#13;
Â· And I said, "You're talking pre-tax, right?"&#13;
&#13;
 He said, "Yes."&#13;
&#13;
 So I went and talked to Personnel and I said, you know, "We have the slot and here's the terms of&#13;
 reference and we've identified the candidate. And this is not a competitively-bid job, so I'd like&#13;
 to hire this guy at"--you know, at the time it was, I guess, Level18 or 19, okay. "And we'd like&#13;
 to pay him"--and I told them that what this guy wanted was 50,000 pre-tax, so that net of taxes it&#13;
 would probably run about 40.&#13;
&#13;
 Personnel came back to me at that point and they said, 'Sorry, we can't do that."&#13;
&#13;
 I said, "Why?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Jamil Sopher&#13;
                       September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    77&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
They said, "Because he's asking for too little money. If he was willing to work for 60,000 a year&#13;
net of tax, we'd hire him into the slot that you have."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Wait a minute. Why are you asking me to pay him $25,000 a year more than he wants,&#13;
o~ay, in order to get this slot?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
They said, "Look, the rules are the rules, but you can hire him at 50 if you hire him as a non-&#13;
regular staff, a long-term consultant." Okay?&#13;
&#13;
Well, I mean to make a long story short, after all of this transpired with Personnel, I called the&#13;
guy. I hired him as a long-term consultant. I had tremendous guilt feelings about it after the&#13;
fact. But instead of offering him 50, I offered him 60. I said, "You know, I'm offering you more&#13;
than you want because we're going to work you very hard and it's not a full staff job."&#13;
&#13;
The third episode occurred when I was Chair of the Staff Association, and I may have made a&#13;
reference to this in an earlier interview. There was a gentleman who I believe was either Level&#13;
11, 12, 13, somewhere in that area, but very poorly paid, from Bangladesh. He'd been with the&#13;
Bank at headquarters for about three years and he was a relatively young man, mid-30s, and he&#13;
had a growing family.&#13;
&#13;
He'd been renting, but he saved money, looked to buy a house, put down the down payment to&#13;
buy the house and then realized that he couldn't meet the full costs if he kept his insurance. So&#13;
he dropped his insurance.&#13;
&#13;
On the day of moving from the rental house to the house he bought, he had a heart attack and&#13;
died. You know, whatever little savings he had left the widow had to spend to take his body&#13;
back to Bangladesh to bury him.&#13;
&#13;
So, you know, about six, seven weeks after this happened, she showed up in my office, you&#13;
know. Actually, she showed up in Marie-Claude's, but Marie-Claude Helman decided to refer&#13;
her to me because this was way beyond her.&#13;
&#13;
And I listened, and my heart really, you know, broke over this because there was absolutely&#13;
nothing in the rules that could be done. And there was nothing at all--I mean, her husband had&#13;
signed a piece of paper that she showed me dropping both his health insurance and his life&#13;
insurance. What do you do?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Were these Bank-sponsored policies?&#13;
&#13;
SOlt&gt;HER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes, uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     78&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Okay, so, you know, what do you do? So I looked at her, and I said, "Look," I said,&#13;
"according to the rules there's nothing I can do, but the Bank is made of up generous people; I'm&#13;
going to see what I can do. But please, don't take this as a promise from me. I'm going to work&#13;
the back channels; I'm going to see what I can shake loose."&#13;
&#13;
So Marie-Claude Helman, who had been sitting with me, looked at me, and she said, "All right,&#13;
if you pull this one out, I'm going to call you Houdini because there's nothing."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Look, I have two things that I'm going to try. First, I'm going to try to talk to Richard&#13;
Stern because he's a generous person."&#13;
&#13;
She said, "Oh, really?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "I know Richard. And then if that doesn't work, I'm going to see if I can get Jim&#13;
Wolfensohn to listen to this."&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, I called Richard. Richard was willing to see me on 15 minutes' notice. I went upstairs,&#13;
I talked to him about this, and he looked at me, and he had the same reaction I did. He said,&#13;
"You know, the Bank--there's nothing in the rules, but the Bank has to be more generous than&#13;
this. Have her come and speak to me, okay."&#13;
&#13;
So I said, "I'll do that, Richard."&#13;
&#13;
And then as I turned around to leave, he said, "Don't promise her anything. I don't know what&#13;
degrees of freedom I have, but let me see."&#13;
&#13;
I called the woman, and I told her to call Richard, and she said, "What do you think might be&#13;
done?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "I don't know." I said, "You know, maybe half a year's salary, maybe a year's salary.&#13;
But, you know, see what's possible." About a week later, she comes down to my office, big&#13;
smile on her face. Richard had offered her three years' salary.&#13;
&#13;
Now, why do I bring these things up? First of all, because each of the three shows that when the&#13;
Bank applies rules it can be very, very hide-bound. Also, you know, the fact that we don't--we're&#13;
not part of any jurisdiction, therefore nobody's laws apply to us, makes us, you know, very&#13;
sanctimonious when it comes to the application of our own rules. But behind those rules is an&#13;
institution of very generous people and, you know, if we can work--you know, ifthere's&#13;
something we can do, we'll try to do it. What I found was that, you know, the Staff Association&#13;
had frequently during my early years in the Bank thought of itself as being in opposition to&#13;
management. They thought of themselves as being contrary to management, adversarial to&#13;
management. What I found was if you can get beyond the official persona of these people, you&#13;
tended to get very, very generous treatment. That was not the case in the - - s o r r y ,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  79&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the non-regular staff episode. That was not the case with my secretary, okay, but we didn't get&#13;
beyond the formal relationship.&#13;
&#13;
I now know that if I had understood that earlier, I would have been a much more effective&#13;
supervisor, and I would have been a much more effective player of the system.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Very useful. That's something people should file away for future reference, I think.&#13;
&#13;
With regard to the Staff Association, Jarnil, prior to becoming Chairman, what other roles did&#13;
you play besides those in the Compensation and Tax Working Groups, which we've already&#13;
covered?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, I had two other roles of significance. One of them was that I was Staff&#13;
Association delegate for whatever unit I was part of for nearly 16 years. I began as a delegate, I&#13;
believe, in 1981, and I became Chairman in '98, and I had, you know, one year in between where&#13;
I have to get off. Now, in the middle of that there were a couple of years when I changed&#13;
regions, and therefore, you know, resigned because I lost my delegate seat ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: .. and then, you know, carne back three months later or four months later, because I&#13;
was now, you know, starting ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You were elected from a different constituency.&#13;
&#13;
SOI'HER: Yes, a new 5-year term.&#13;
&#13;
The other one was that I was Chair ofthe Travel Working Group.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I didn't know that, actually.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah. Now, Paul [M.] Cadario had been the longstanding Chair, but as he rose in&#13;
management, he was essentially told by management he has to drop this, he has to drop his&#13;
various Staff Association involvements. He dropped everything except his chairmanship of the&#13;
Benefits Working Group. Since they weren't doing anything active at the time, you know, he felt&#13;
he could hold on to that, and as it turned out he was very helpful as the Chair of that working&#13;
group during my term.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I believe that as Chair of the Travel Working Group, I preserved first-class travel for us for&#13;
something like about five years. And when we finally had to give way, I think I did a pretty&#13;
good job of working things out so that, yes, we got business class travel instead, but the&#13;
opportunity for upgrades was preserved. And so, you know, that's where things were left.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: If I could ask--this isn't in the formal list of questions, but I'm curious.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    80&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Was dropping first-class travel a legitimate thing for the Bank to do in your eyes?&#13;
You were in Operations for many years. You had to travel all over the place. How would this&#13;
have affected the average Bank staff member? I mean, was it a significant savings that helped&#13;
the Bank considerably without too much effect on the staff, or how did you see it?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, it's a mixed bag, Chuck. I mean, the problem that you have is that we get&#13;
business class tickets, but we get the most expensive business class tickets going. There were&#13;
opportunities to get first-class tickets that were less expensive than the business class tickets we&#13;
wound up getting. So, you know, the economic argument didn't make a lot of sense.&#13;
&#13;
The perception argument made a great deal of sense. How could we represent ourselves as&#13;
working for the interests of the poor when we were going around flying first class? I mean, there&#13;
was a degree to which we had to bring together our image with our mission.&#13;
&#13;
But 1there was one--there were a couple of other aspects to this that need to be factored in. The&#13;
first one is that in an institution like the World Bank, there are very few things that you can give&#13;
to reward people for service, long standing, you name it. One of them is first-class travel;&#13;
another is a larger office. And, you know, when you take away all of these perks more or less at&#13;
the same time and you've got people who can only be paid a salary--there's very little additional&#13;
to the salary that you can give them--then at that point you sort of sit back and wonder, "Am I&#13;
appreciated?"&#13;
&#13;
So, I mean, I think that because of the work that we did, the Bank handled the first-class travel a&#13;
bit more elegantly than they did in cutting the sizes of offices. But still, it just struck me as&#13;
though this could have been managed with a greater degree of personal care.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I remember that cutting the size of offices. It was a rather brutal exercise, in my&#13;
perception.&#13;
&#13;
SOlflHER: It was, and the problem was that senior management didn't do the leadership job it&#13;
should have. I remember attending an East Asia meeting, because I was delegate from East&#13;
Asia. This was during my period as Chair. And somebody asked a question about the reduction&#13;
in the size of offices, and I said, "Look, it's very hard for me to justify this in terms of personnel&#13;
relations. But if you look at it from the point of view of the Bank, if they can get everyone into&#13;
Bank-owned buildings, they're saving $19 million a year in rent. Now, who are you going to fire&#13;
to make up that $19 million a year if you're going to retain the size of your offices?"&#13;
&#13;
The:re was a gentleman in my audience named [Robert] Van Pulley. Van is now director in&#13;
charge of ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: GSD [General Services Department].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: .. GSD and really a wonderful person. He pulled me aside after that meeting, and&#13;
he said, "Jamil, I have only one thing wrong, one problem with the answer that you gave about&#13;
the shrinking of the offices."&#13;
&#13;
I saidl, "What's that, Van?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "I should have heard that from Shengman Zhang, not you." Okay.&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, I mean that as an anecdote crystallizes more than anything else the fact that, you&#13;
know, I found myself often in the unfortunate position in collaborating with management that I&#13;
was having to take management's point of view because they didn't represent it very well.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes, yeah. Now we're getting into the real meat of the issue, I think. The most&#13;
significant issue or set of issues during your chairmanship of the Staff Association was the top-&#13;
to-bottom revision of the Bank's human resources policies. Could you relate some of the factors&#13;
that !led to this undertaking and describe the Staff Association's role and your own in it?&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: All right. Let me take a-take a step backward because I think, you know, there are&#13;
two things that influenced the need for human resources reform and then there was a third&#13;
overlaid on top of it.                          -&#13;
&#13;
The first is that the 1987 reorganization was an absolute disaster. What it did was it took an&#13;
institution that was a proud institution where people were, you know, focused on the good of the&#13;
institution and it created a very wide network of satraps. And, you know, your loyalty was no&#13;
longer to your-to the institution. You became loyal to your satrap.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the satrap who chose me in in 1987 was Gautam Kaji, and, you know, my thinking from&#13;
about '87 until about 1996 was, "What is the good ofGautam?" Okay. Whatever Gautam&#13;
wanted, that's what I did. Whether the Bank-whether it served the Bank or not, that's what I did&#13;
because I was very clearly part of his network. That had to change, and the only way we could&#13;
change it was to go through a major reshuffling of the way we worked.&#13;
&#13;
The second thing--and I believe I referred to this in previous interviews--was that we were&#13;
coming under fire very broadly from our owners, civil society, our borrowers, you name it. One&#13;
of my favorite stories is when, you lmow, I was working in the Philippines in FY95, the early&#13;
part of '95, and they had an allocation of 500 million and they only took 15. And three days after&#13;
we approved the 15, they canceled 8.&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, so a number of us who were working in the Philippines at the time, we decided&#13;
to get to Manila at the same time and, you know, talk with our contacts. And the message we got&#13;
was, "Guys, you come with much too much excess baggage." Okay. "We're willing to do&#13;
without rather than put up with the excess baggage."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    82&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The excess baggage being much too much conditionality on the loans?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, you know, it's easy to talk about it as being conditionality. But I remember&#13;
being asked to lead a sector study on environment in the Philippines that nobody wanted. The&#13;
Filipinos didn't want it. We made 3 missions. We tied up senior officials a lot on this sector&#13;
study, and when we finally issued the green cover [Staff Appraisal Report] and we sent it to&#13;
them, you know, they said, "Thank you very much." They stuck it on their shelves, and nobody&#13;
ever opened it.&#13;
&#13;
Six months later, I called in at the office ofthe Secretary ofEnvironment, and I said, "You know,&#13;
you've never given us any comments on our environmental sector study."&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "The reason we haven't is because we didn't want it. We're not interested in it."&#13;
&#13;
So I said, "Well, you know, can you at least give us some comment so that we can go to gray&#13;
( COVI~r] ?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Publish it in gray already; we don't care. It'll gather just as much dust in gray as it does&#13;
in green." So we published it in gray, and, to my knowledge, you know--this is now 13 years&#13;
later--I don't think that that report has ever seen the light of day.&#13;
&#13;
And this is the sort of thing. We would put into our loans components that nobody wanted. You&#13;
know, when we developed our social policies, resettlement and the like, we never really took&#13;
care to explain to our borrowers why we're doing this. It was, "The Bank wants it; you'd better&#13;
do it." Okay. So, you know, these are the sorts of things.&#13;
&#13;
But in any event, because we had lost credibility with just about all of the stakeholders, we had&#13;
to do things differently. And one of the most important things about doing things differently was&#13;
being less Bank-centric.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I said there was a third factor that was overlaid on top of it. The third factor was we had a&#13;
new president. And I mean it's inevitable; every time you have a new president, he wants--the&#13;
new one wants to change things.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And this would be Jim Wolfensohn, for the record.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: This was Jim Wolfensohn. The difference between the changes that Jim wanted to&#13;
make and the one, the previous ones, is Jim actually had a vision about what the Bank ought to&#13;
do, as opposed to the others who were shuffling boxes or pleasing, you know, a Republican&#13;
[U.S.] President. So, you know, Jim gave very clear guidance about what the changes ought to&#13;
look like.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing was that Jim-it's almost simultaneous with Jim becoming president--was the&#13;
Part I countries tightening up on the administrative budget, so we were at a point where we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     83&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
couldn't spend like the way we had spent previous to that. And for that reason we had to try to&#13;
contain costs, and this was a problem that Jim laid on us as the new president. But, you know, he&#13;
was getting that as part of his other conversation, the conversation with his owners that takes&#13;
place once or twice a week at the Board room. Now, that's how it came about because there ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yeah. What I was asking is how did the Staff Association address this particular&#13;
set of issues from your perspective?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: I think we were very lucky that this came about at a period when we were inclined to&#13;
be collaborative. I think that if we were going to be adversarial as we have through most of our&#13;
history, we would have ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: This "our" being the Staff Association?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: That's correct.&#13;
&#13;
I think we would have shut ourselves out of the picture. These things would have happened.&#13;
They would have been a lot worse, and, you know, it-- I think, you know, the mood today would&#13;
be a lot less upbeat about the institution than it is right now.&#13;
&#13;
I think the Staff Association took some very big risks in being collaborative, and I personally&#13;
took some big risks in being collaborative, and, you know, I paid a price. Most of the time,&#13;
being collaborative worked. Although the number of victories I won were very few, there were&#13;
enough of them so that, you know, I was able to retain my credibility with my constituency.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, the other side of it is I was never interested in being Staff Association Chair, and if we&#13;
didn't have this major human resources reform going on at the time, I don't think I would have&#13;
ever run for it because on the surface of it, when you're not going through that level of reform,&#13;
it's a pretty boring job.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I remember, as you will remember, I was on the executive committee at the time.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And I seem to recall you saying that--or being told--that Jim Wolfensohn&#13;
essentially said, "Look, the Staff Association is going to be involved." I think it was important&#13;
that we got meaningful collaboration--or meaningful consultation, I should say--from&#13;
management, rather than just, as is all too often the case, this perfunctory sort of consultation.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, first of all, during your first year as First Vice--I think it was the first year of&#13;
Fred [Frederick W.] Wright's term ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIJE:GLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  84&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
S~PHER:        .. when you were First Vice Chair ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: First Vice Chair, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: .. that was the year that Jim Wolfensohn gave the glass wall speech. And at that point&#13;
he had absolutely no strategic allies anywhere in the Bank; I mean, he was easily the most&#13;
despised person in the institution. We sensed an opportunity in that void, and at the time of the&#13;
salary increase we went in with a speech where we offered partnership. It was then that Jim&#13;
decided that, "Hey, these are the first people who are offering me a partnership. Now, yeah,&#13;
there's strings attached, but, you know, these are my first partners."&#13;
&#13;
So, yeah, he did assure us that we would be part of the dialogue. But, you know, I got the sense&#13;
that it was because he felt he could work with us. And I also got the sense when he had a&#13;
meeting with the Non-Regular Staff Working Group during my first couple of months as Chair&#13;
and they threatened to take a case to the Tribunal that Jim could turn pretty nasty if he wanted to,&#13;
okay. And, you know, I think that the way he operated was he was willing to serve as partner,&#13;
okay, if you were willing to be partners with him.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I recall also that in the meetings we had with him, we didn't always necessarily&#13;
agre'e with him or he with us, but I don't think he ever said something that he didn't deliver on or&#13;
said something and then went ahead and did another. I mean, you could trust what the man said,&#13;
it seemed to me anyway.&#13;
&#13;
SOI'HER: There were two levels of dialogue with him. The first one was the public dialogue&#13;
when he was either with the Executive Committee or, more likely, with the Delegate Assembly.&#13;
It was always correct, and he very seldom made a statement that he didn't live up to. There was&#13;
the other level of dialogue which was conducted in private, and usually it was with the Chair or&#13;
the Chair and one other person, and those could be some pretty brutal sessions.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I had the benefit of, you know, being able to relate to Jim very much the way that I had had&#13;
to rdate to my father when I was younger. A lot ofhis techniques of interpersonal relations were&#13;
very similar to my dad's. So the very same stoicism that, you know, I had to use in working with&#13;
my dad I was able to put to work in working with Jim, and it wasn't so bad.&#13;
&#13;
The only two times that he left me really shaken were when he caught me completely by&#13;
surprise, okay, and then it wasn't so easy to be stoic about it. I was usually the second person to&#13;
go along when he spoke to Fred Wright and ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That's when Fred was Chairman?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: That was when Fred was Chair.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: And when I was Chair, sometimes the second person I brought along was Gacangi&#13;
Kiruthi, First Vice Chair, or Bill [William T.] Onorato, who was Second. Usually if it was a&#13;
relatively straightforward matter, I'd bring Gacangi. If it was something where I knew that he'd&#13;
be testy and, you know, he'd be trying out ideas--which he often did, okay--I'd bring along Bill.&#13;
Bill had an uncanny ability to talk with him, much better than me. So, you know ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Bill was from the Legal Department, one of these lawyer types.&#13;
&#13;
SOF1 HER: Bill was from the Bronx [New York]. That was the ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That probably helped, too.&#13;
&#13;
SOP'HER: That helped a lot. And, you know, Bill was clearly a Jim Wolfensohn groupie, and&#13;
Jim knew that and liked it, so, you know, Bill was able to smooth over a lot of stuff. But, you&#13;
know, some of those get-togethers--about 80 percent of the time it was in his office, but the other&#13;
20 percent was in mine. And man, you know, those were not easy.&#13;
&#13;
You know, one ofthe things that Jim knew was that he could be extremely logical and poke&#13;
holes through all my defenses.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, he is a smart guy, no question about that.&#13;
&#13;
SOJPHER: Yes, and there were a couple oftimes when, you know--especially early on when I&#13;
would backup and then finally, you know, Jim would come off his aggressiveness and say,&#13;
"Look, you didn't get elected to let me have my way. Now, come back at me, for Christ's sake,"&#13;
where, you know ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He actually said that straight up to you?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So, to me, that shows that he had a good understanding of your position, your&#13;
official position.&#13;
&#13;
SOJPHER: He also had an understanding of where my heart was. I had told him on one&#13;
occasion--and he remembered it all the way to 2005, earlier this year, the last time I had lunch&#13;
with him, where I said, "I'm a member of the World Bank staff first and a member of the Staff&#13;
Association second; that, you know, my--I resonate with the institution; it's not--to me, this is&#13;
not a union thing." And he reminded me of that a number of times.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: We had touched very briefly on the non-regular staff issue earlier on in your ..&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       86&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Jamil, before that slight interruption, I was going to ask you about the non-regular&#13;
staff issue. You touched on it very briefly in your previous answer, but during your involvement&#13;
with the Staff Association would you say that this non-regular staff issue was successfully&#13;
resolved?&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: You know, it's hard to come up with a clear-cut answer. What you had with regard&#13;
 to non-regular staff--first of all, I don't think that there was a way of resolving this if regular staff&#13;
 had not taken on the cause of the non-regular staff. I think that where the non-regular staff were&#13;
 wise was, you know, up to the point that we went through the human resources reform, pitched&#13;
 their tent with people who had been there before. And, you know, they wound up making some&#13;
 compromises with me and, you know, with the existing staff. But we then were able to fight&#13;
Â·their battles, and I think that it would have been almost impossible for them to win this if ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: On their own?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: On their own, if they had done it without the rest of the staff coming in and saying&#13;
"We buy this and we think that you ought to, you know, you ought to deal with this issue."&#13;
&#13;
At one point in a private conversation Jim asked me, he said, "Why are you taking up their&#13;
cause? What has this got to do with you?" And that's when I related the incident that happened&#13;
in East Asia when I wasn't allowed to give a promising candidate a slot because he wanted too&#13;
little money.&#13;
&#13;
You know, so I said, "You know, I've been there. I've been on the other side of this, and I think&#13;
that what the Bank has been doing is wrong." And that coming from me, a regular staff, was&#13;
much more powerful than anything that might have come from the non-regulars.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the problem with the non-regular staff issue--and this is why I have a lot of difficulty&#13;
giving clear-cut answers here--is because during the campaign that I ran to get elected as Staff&#13;
Association Chair, they told me that what they wanted were jobs, regular jobs. I had very little&#13;
difficulty with that. From my point of view, the fact that there were 2 classes of Bank employees&#13;
was wrong. It was morally wrong, and it was also bad for the institution. But once I got elected-&#13;
-and it was very fast, okay--it became very clear these guys didn't really want jobs. It didn't&#13;
matter to them whether they were employed as regular staff. They wanted pensions. And, in&#13;
fact, they would have been very willing to retain their non-regular status as long as they had&#13;
pensions because the process of going from regular to-from non-regular to regular meant they&#13;
had to go through a selection process and there was an element of risk that they may lose their&#13;
jobs. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
So, you know, I mean that--that was the core issue, and from where I sat, you know, I felt--well,&#13;
I went through the election in December of'97, and by about February, March, I felt as though I&#13;
had been deceived by this group of people because they had in effect misinformed me as to what&#13;
it was that they really wanted.                                                  Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    87&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Throughout the discussion of the issue with Jim Wolfensohn and senior management, I decided&#13;
to do it my way, and doing it my way was we would put all our effort into getting them jobs,&#13;
because that was the thing that was wrong, and we would do the best we could but pursue the&#13;
legal avenue with regard to pensions, and hopefully the legal avenue would take longer than my&#13;
term as Chair.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, as I recall also, they were interested in pensions for retroactive service,&#13;
retroactive meaning their period as non-regular staff.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Exactly. You know, they wanted retroactive pensions, and they wanted them to be&#13;
given to them, not purchased, but given. And the other thing was that, you know, in whatever&#13;
new jobs they had they, of course, wanted pensions. Now, once hired in as regular staff, they got&#13;
pensions, so that part of it was easy, but it was the past pension credits; that was the tough one.&#13;
&#13;
Now, first of all, management did agree as part ofthe human resources reform to hire in these&#13;
people following a selection procedure. Management assumed that 50 percent would get&#13;
selected in. As it turned out, it was about 70, 72. So from that point of view, I think that that&#13;
was a very successful aspect to it.&#13;
&#13;
Management shot us down when it came to past pension credits. We went the Tribunal route.&#13;
Much to my dismay, the Tribunal rendered a decision in November of'99, so I had to deal with&#13;
the next steps. The impression I had was that Jim was very aware that I was going to be leaving&#13;
the job, and what he said to me is, he said, "I'm willing to talk about this, but I want to take the&#13;
measure of your successor, and if she's someone I can work with, then, you know, we'll try to&#13;
find a way of resolving this."&#13;
&#13;
It turned out that, you know, she decided to attack him promptly, and it took him until November&#13;
of the year that she left office three years later for him to give some ground on the past pension&#13;
credits issue. I think that the manner in which it was resolved was, at least in my view, a little&#13;
less generous than if, you know, she had been collaborative. In effect, I think, you know, some&#13;
of her, you know, adversarial approaches cost them about two and a half years and dollars.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: For the record, that's Morallina George ..&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: .. who also served three years, yes.&#13;

                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                88&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Jamil, in your view, what were the most significant outcomes of this revision of the&#13;
human resources policy?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: You know, hindsight is always a lot better than dealing with it at the time. One thing&#13;
I've come to really appreciate, especially over the last five years, is the extent to which an&#13;
institution like the Bank needs new blood. Not only it needs new blood in day-to-day jobs, but at&#13;
managerial levels it needs new blood.&#13;
&#13;
The manner in which I think the HR reform served us best was that it created a level of turnover.&#13;
Now, some of that turnover would have happened anyway because a lot of people were reaching&#13;
mandatory retirement age. But the thing is that the message came through as a result of all this&#13;
turnover that we needed to do business differently. My guess is that if it had been an orderly&#13;
hand-over, you know, of mandatory retirement from people leaving to people coming in, we&#13;
would have had new individuals, but we would have been doing business the same way. And as&#13;
a result of the way all of this happened, we did change the way we do business, and we did&#13;
change it in a much better way. I'll talk more about that as we go along.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing that is very striking is that we're a much more efficient and, you know, cost-&#13;
effective organization now than we were then. At the time, you know, the early '90s, I didn't see&#13;
how we could save money, but now I do. Having become an adviser in LAC [Latin America and&#13;
the Caribbean] overseeing a particular product, I've begun to understand how these products are&#13;
very similar from one country to the next, to the next, to the next, and there are efficiencies of&#13;
scale that you can get, and therefore the amount that you spend on each one doesn't have to be,&#13;
you know, top dollar. So there's another area where I think we have become more cost-effective.&#13;
&#13;
Now, in denying, you know, perks and goodies to the staff, again, you know, we're a leaner&#13;
organization that does things in a better way today than we were then. But I think, you know, the&#13;
manner of execution is at least as important as what it is you're executing, and I think that&#13;
management didn't do things very well.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In terms of implementing the human resources?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: In terms of the way they went about it. Let me give you just one example: the 2&#13;
percent pay increase in '99.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That was on your watch, as I recall.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah .. You know ..&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
SOJ~HER:     We were going to change the pay system. That was inevitable. We were also going&#13;
to lose a certain amount of ground with respect to the old pay system and also with respect to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  89&#13;
&#13;
[International Monetary] Fund because the Fund was retaining the old pay system. That was aiso&#13;
inevitable.&#13;
&#13;
The problem was that they decided to give us the hit all at once, and when that wasn't sufficient--&#13;
to give us a lousy pay increase--they fiddled with the system in order to give us still a lousier pay&#13;
increase. Now, this was right at the height of the human resources reform when people were&#13;
going bonkers trying to figure out how to do their work. They were feeling generally&#13;
unappreciated, and, you know, suddenly you hit them with another thirig like this. And there was&#13;
a perception that remained for about a year and a half that the Bank was a very unkind employer.&#13;
&#13;
Now, this also happened at the same time as, you know, the boom times came to an end and&#13;
recession started to set in, so a lot of people who might otherwise have wanted to leave didn't&#13;
because they couldn't. They didn't have the option. But what I do remember from that period&#13;
was that people receiving packages were pretty happy because they were effectively being given&#13;
two years to find something else and they were leaving this unkind employer.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Or what they perceived to be an unkind employer.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOI'HER: Yeah. Now, to be honest with you, Chuck, I think when we--you know, 50 years&#13;
from now when we look at 9/11, there's going to be a lot of different reactions than there are&#13;
today.&#13;
&#13;
To me, the best thing that ever happened to the Bank was 9/11, okay. Three reasons. First, Jim&#13;
Wolfensohn managed it extremely well. And he--you know, by drawing together this linkage&#13;
between the fight against poverty and world peace, he brought a lot of Bank staff back to him&#13;
and back to the institution, while, you know, they had been alienated for quite a time prior to&#13;
that. The second thing was that a lot of people who were thinking of the Bank as an unkind&#13;
employer began to feel pretty lucky that they had an employer. And the third thing, I guess, is&#13;
that, you know, given the leadership that Jim showed, throughout the Bank there was a certain&#13;
level of concern showed to staff that, you know, hadn't been shown to staff for a long time. For&#13;
example, Security went out of its way to, you know, ensure our safety while we were traveling,&#13;
or to ensure that we would travel in the safest possible way. These are the types ofthings that&#13;
were noticed, and so, you know, a lot of the staff members who, you know, had been thinking&#13;
very, very negatively about the institution were turned around.&#13;
&#13;
What was really interesting to me was that, you know, Morallina George ran for a third term&#13;
because she could at that point, and the first half of 2002 she continued to try to be adversarial&#13;
and it wasn't gaining any--you know, there was no traction left to that anymore. And so she just-&#13;
-you know, she ended her term very quietly, and I think that was very much the result of 9/11.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 90&#13;
&#13;
Jim went on "Charlie Rose" [television program] about 3 or 4 days after 9/11 happened. It was a&#13;
tour de force. It was really Jim's best performance in a public venue, at least that I'm aware of.&#13;
And bit by--I saw it at the time, but bit by bit people within the Bank began to talk about this,&#13;
and so it was played on the web for a couple of days and ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: On the internal web?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: The internal web. And what I remember about that was how much conversation&#13;
there was about how eloquent Jim had been in giving us a role, you know, going forward in&#13;
terms of creating this better world that we now really all knew we needed. So I think that made&#13;
an enormous difference. But if we hadn't had 9/11, I don't know how much longer the back-&#13;
biting would have gone on because there was a lot of it at the time.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, this leads into another question, a similar question. In previous interviews&#13;
we've addressed the issue of institutional culture, and it seems to me the questions of values and&#13;
behavior as manifested in the institutional culture were important to you. During the period that&#13;
you were Chairman of the Staff Association, how did you address these questions and what&#13;
improvements in values and behavior did you attempt to foster?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, there was one thing that I did, and I did it very regularly. Every single month,&#13;
I had a column in The Bank's World and ..&#13;
&#13;
[Int~erruption]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: J amil, you were just talking about having a monthly column in The Bank's World.&#13;
&#13;
SOI,HER: Yeah, and what I tried to do with the monthly column was not discuss Bank issues&#13;
but rather to discuss values. And, you know, I tried to use anecdotes and other sorts of things as&#13;
a way of providing a bit of leadership with regard to what is good behavior and what is not.&#13;
There were things that I tried to push like, for example, when you take summer vacation, really&#13;
take some vacation to get a fresh mind, not--and that there's a limited virtue to, you know,&#13;
working all the time and not developing a certain amount of balance in your life.&#13;
&#13;
I talked a lot, especially early in my first time, about behaviors. Now, up until that period,&#13;
nobody was willing to talk about behaviors. They were trying to do things that would alter&#13;
behavior, but very few people were willing to talk about it. You know, we tried to keep internal&#13;
conversation at the level of professional dialogue. I think we became a more effective institution&#13;
when we began to talk about behavior.&#13;
&#13;
Now, embedding the values of the Bank in the mission statement, I think, was a non-event, and&#13;
the reason I think it's a non-event is because when you have a mission statement that's a&#13;
relatively complicated one, people will remember the first two sentences. They're not going to&#13;
remember the second and third pages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  91&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And for the record, let me--I have the mission statement here.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The mission statement says, quote, "Our core"--it has a section on our core values--&#13;
"These values are personal honesty, integrity, commitment; working together in teams with&#13;
openness and trust; empowering others and respecting differences; encouraging risk-taking and&#13;
responsibility; enjoying our work and our families." So this is in the mission statement, the core&#13;
values which are embodied in the Bank's mission statement.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: I'm willing to bet you that if you asked fifty people where does that language come&#13;
from, you may have only two who will tell you that that's in the mission statement, okay. I&#13;
mean, the thing is that the first two sentences of the mission statement are overwhelmingly&#13;
powerful. What comes afterwards nobody knows.&#13;
&#13;
But to me, the thing that's important is that in the period of, that we were going through the&#13;
human resources reform, we were retraining managers, more and more the vice presidents&#13;
begilming to talk about behavior, what is constructive behavior and what's not, and more and&#13;
more there was discussion of it within their units.&#13;
&#13;
Before 1997, I had the view that people considered the word "behavior" to mean the way they&#13;
were brought up, and, you know, there was a very real effort to avoid any discussion of that at&#13;
all. When they began to see that behavior was how do they relate to one another and what is a&#13;
good way of relating to one another and what's not, that changed a lot about the institution.&#13;
&#13;
Agailn, an anecdote. Back in 1996 when I was still in East Asia Country Department I and&#13;
Calllsto Madavo was still my director, we had a yellow cover meeting for a piece of work in the&#13;
PhiHppines. And at that point, the Bank was really at its most strident. I don't remember an&#13;
episode like this since, and I know that there was a build-up to it before. Callisto Madavo was&#13;
presiding over this meeting, and he called on the peer reviewers, and one was more shrill than&#13;
the next and one was nastier than the next. There were three of them. And finally at the end of&#13;
the peer reviewers when it was very clear that the task manager had been verbally assaulted in a&#13;
most unkind way, Callisto looked up, took off his glasses, and he said, you know, "I don't like&#13;
the tone of this meeting. This is not constructive, and this is not the way we're going to do&#13;
positive business. So I'm going to ask the peer reviewers to start all over again, but I want to&#13;
hear a different tone. You're trying to make this work better. You're not trying to prove how&#13;
smart you are." And all of a sudden, the tension left the room.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the three peer reviewers were pretty vexed. One of them indicated that he wasn't sure that&#13;
he had anything to add to what he had to say, and Callisto invited him to leave if he didn't have&#13;
anything to add. So he stayed, and, you know, he made a more positive contribution.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the word of that spread around our department fairly fast. It did not really spread around&#13;
the Bank, which surprised me, but it spread around our department, and the upshot of it was that,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
you know, people began to understand that they had to behave better toward one another. And I&#13;
think, you know, in that sense our country department was a leader in the change of behavior&#13;
within the Bank. But I think it was really necessary because, you know, it wasn't just that we&#13;
were shrill. We were getting personal.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Uh-huh. Did you have any personal input in that formulation of the core values&#13;
that we were just talking about?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: I was once asked about the mission statement as we were at an advanced stage of&#13;
adopting it. And I was also asked what did I think was the most important thing we needed to&#13;
accomplish before the exercise was launched.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And you were in what position at that time? Was this as Chairman or just ...&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: I was Second Vice Chair when I was spoken to the first time. And I was Chair&#13;
when, you know, the mission statement was announced.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: I don't remember what I had to say when, you know, they read me what was likely&#13;
to come of the mission statement. But, you know, at that point it had embodied the thing that&#13;
was my biggest concern and I gave it my blessing .&#13;
&#13;
.ZIEGLER: And that thing was?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Okay, that was what I was asked about at the first meeting, and I said, "Guys, I've&#13;
been at the Bank for nearly 20 years now, and the first meeting I came to at the Bank there was a&#13;
conflict that was evident between are we a bank or are we a development institution."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That's an old conflict, too.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Exactly, and to me the problem is that we expend a great deal of energy on that&#13;
contlict, and I think it's a very honest conflict, and I would like to see it resolved through the&#13;
mission statement. I'd like to have clarity. So when the mission statement comes out with "our&#13;
dream is a world free of poverty" ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: We're a development institution.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: We're a development institution and, you know, we no longer have to fight that war.&#13;
I was very happy about that.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And that goes back years and years, too ..&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: .. I mean almost to the beginning of the Bank, if you will, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In the context of institutional culture and values, it's worth noting that you played a&#13;
significant role in the publication of a book entitled Our Dream: A World Free of Poverty, which&#13;
was jointly sponsored by the World Bank Group and by the Staff Association and which was&#13;
published by Oxford University Press. Can you describe your role in that work?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, there were really three areas where I spent a lot of time. The first one was in&#13;
getting it financed. You know, we had a Poverty Working Group. We had a delegate from&#13;
Africa who was extremely well-meaning and, you know, who made the point that we needed a&#13;
Poverty Working Group. And in terms of my better judgment, I hadn't a clue as to what we&#13;
needed a Poverty Working Group for, but he had a following, and a good politician knows that&#13;
when you've got a guy who wants to do something good and he has personally a good following,&#13;
you don't tell him no.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, my recollection is that this was Thierry [A.] Brun.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Thierry Brun, yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: B-R-U-N, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOIâ&#128;¢HER: Yeah. So I let him have this Poverty Working Group and I attended the meetings,&#13;
and every time, you know, I attended a meeting, I came out of it scratching my head, and I said,&#13;
"What are we doing? You know, we're churning. I mean, you know, it's great that we're talking&#13;
to the choir, but so what?"&#13;
&#13;
So I called Thierry in, and it was probably around August or September of '98, and I said to him,&#13;
I said, "Where are you going with this thing?"&#13;
&#13;
"Well, you know, I want to sensitize people to the fact that, you know, we should be more&#13;
poverty-focused, you know. We've had people who have suffered because they were poverty-&#13;
focused."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Look, what you're telling me is this is the old conflict of are we a bank or are we a&#13;
development institution. But by having meetings where we're talking to ourselves, we're not&#13;
going to break that cycle. So what is a project that we can do where we give, you know, a little&#13;
bit more muscle to the Bank's poverty role and to the people who are doing good work on&#13;
poverty?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       94&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
All of a sudden, he lit up, and we began a brain-storming session which--you know, I had set it&#13;
up to meet with him for half an hour. We met for two hours. We went to lunch during that&#13;
period. We talked about it, and it was out of this that we came up with the idea of a book.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the idea of a book wasn't hard to come by because there was a lady named Sandra&#13;
Granzow, who was married to Jim [James M.] Kearns and she was a consultant for EXT&#13;
[Extc:rnal Affairs Department] who had been toying with the idea of doing a display in the ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Atrium, uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: .. atrium, you know, a monthly display of the different projects that succeeded. I&#13;
meatt, that was her idea. So we figured, "Okay, let's pull all of this together. Let's support her&#13;
project and then wrap it into a book."&#13;
&#13;
I spoke to her. She was very excited. Then I spoke to EXT, and they poured a lot of cold water&#13;
on it. It was then that I understood that there were some political issues, okay, within EXT. So I&#13;
decided to maintain my focus on one person, and that was Jane Armitage, who was very&#13;
favorable to the book.&#13;
&#13;
Jane said to me, she said, "Look, this thing is never going to see the light of day if it's going to&#13;
come out of our budget. So if you can raise the money for it, you're going to have your book."&#13;
&#13;
So the next opportunity I had--well, no, there was an interesting thing that happened in between.&#13;
In between the--this was early October, and, you know, I had to make my decision as to whether&#13;
I was going to run for a second term. And Jim--I had written something in The Bank's World--&#13;
not The Bank's World, the newsletter ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The Staff Association newsletter?&#13;
&#13;
SOJ&gt;HER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: .. that Jim didn't like, so he asked me to come up to the Board for a statement that&#13;
he was going to make. This was in late September. And he took the Staff Association newsletter&#13;
to pieces and indirectly ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In front of the Board?&#13;
&#13;
SOJPHER: In front of the Board. And indirectly me. So I decided that, well ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That must have been fun.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, you know, I mean he had his moments when he could be very difficult. So I&#13;
decided to play a card that I figured would work, and that was that I called John [D.] McArthur,&#13;
and I said, "Look, I want to come and talk to you."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, John McArthur is ...&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: John McArthur was the former dean of the Harvard Business School who was a&#13;
consultant for Jim. And I figured that my way of bypassing management and getting messages&#13;
to Jim was John McArthur or Elaine Wolfensohn. I had access to both of them, and it was a case&#13;
ofknowing--you know, having good judgment about which one to reach.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Is McArthur with an M-A-C or M-C?&#13;
&#13;
SOI1HER: I think it's M-C.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Anyway, I called John, and John said, you know, "I'm very busy, but would you&#13;
driv~e&#13;
     me to the airport?" I said, "Fine." So I picked up the car, and I picked him up and drove&#13;
him over to National [Airport], and during that time I told him what had happened. And I said,&#13;
"You know, John," I said, "it's very interesting that this happened now because this has saved me&#13;
from a big mistake."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "What do you mean?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, you know, I didn't come into this job in order to make Jim or other people&#13;
miserable. Now, I have to decide within the next two weeks whether I'm going to run again,&#13;
okay. I have decided I'm not going to run again. You know, I really--I want him to be happy,&#13;
okay. So let him deal with a successor of mine, but in any event, you know, I've enjoyed&#13;
working with you, and this may well be the last time I'll be speaking with you so--you know,&#13;
because my term expires in December, and I'm going to keep a very low profile between now&#13;
and then." That was somewhere around the 30th or so of September.&#13;
&#13;
The next week was the Annual Meetings. Immediately after the Annual Meetings, I got calls&#13;
from Caio [K.] Koch-Weser: "Can we have lunch?" Sven Sandstrom: "Can we have lunch?"&#13;
Jim: "Can we have lunch?" Okay. And I'm sitting back thinking, "Hey!" [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
So, anyway, it was during that point that I'd been thinking about the book, and, you know, it was&#13;
late in my first term, not my second. So I used the opportunity with Sven. I figured with Jim I'm&#13;
not going to hold him up, okay. I'm just going to talk to him about how, you know, we need to&#13;
treat each other with a little bit more respect, you know. Okay. But with Sven I used that as an&#13;
opportunity to talk to him about what I thought the Bank needed, and one of the things I felt very&#13;
strongly that the Bank needed and that the staff needed was a shot in the arm. They were told&#13;
repeatedly by everyone in sight when they did something wrong, but they weren't told when they&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
did something right. And I laid out the book idea that Thierry Brun and I had talked about, and I&#13;
said, "I want to be able to produce our book for the 50th"--it wasn't the 50th anniversary; it was&#13;
some: fair in Heidelberg or something like that where the Bank was going to have a display.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: So this was going to be our piece to that. And he said, "Well, you know, the Bank is&#13;
putting together a much bigger book for that."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Fine, let the Staff Association do one; let the Bank do another; let the market decide&#13;
which one's better. But at the same time, I need money, and I'd like you to put up $100,000 for&#13;
this so that I can then use that and go from vice president to vice president and get more."&#13;
&#13;
Sven said, "Well, you know, I'm going to have to think about this a little bit."&#13;
&#13;
And then I went to--I had hmch with Jim, and I never raised the issue of the book, and I talked to&#13;
him about showing more respect, and then about 2 hours later after that lunch I get a call from&#13;
Sven saying, "Jim has decided that he's willing to finance your book to the tune of 100,000." So&#13;
that was the seed money that I needed.&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, I went with Thierry and Sandy Granzow from vice president to vice president&#13;
and we raised about 260,000 for the book.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: As I recall, Jim wrote an introduction?&#13;
&#13;
SOlf&gt;HER: Yeah. He has an introduction which Sandra wrote. I have a foreword which I&#13;
wrote, and then Mike [Michael] Walton, who was the head of the poverty network ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
SQJ&gt;HER: .. had an introduction. So the first thing was to finance it. Once I did that, I&#13;
                        this on auto     " It turned out I couldn't.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The other thing was that Sandy Granzow, left to her own devices, would have finished the&#13;
budget and spent twice as much. And so, again, I have to come in as the controller on this. And,&#13;
together, we chose a publisher who was terrific, and I managed to get the publisher offline, and I&#13;
said, "Look, I can't afford what you're suggesting; give me a pro bono rate."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: This is Oxford University Press?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Oxford University Press was the actual, you know, machinery that created the book,&#13;
but the publisher was the one who fed it into Oxford University Press and that was Meadows&#13;
Design.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Meadows Design?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah, and Mark Meadows became a very good friend of mine through that, and, you&#13;
know, Mark did it at rock-bottom prices. So we delivered the whole thing at something like&#13;
about 225,000. And the 225, you know, was really good in the sense it was a very good price as&#13;
far as I was concerned, but it also gave us additional money to order additional copies. It gave us&#13;
additional money to translate the book into French and Spanish. Now, I don't know what ever&#13;
became of the Spanish version, but the French was passed all over Francophone Africa. And so,&#13;
you know ...&#13;
&#13;
Now, what happened with this book? I regard this book as being, you know, my gift to the&#13;
World Bank. I loved it. I did it as a labor oflove, and I--you know, I worked through every&#13;
single word that Sandy put together. And, you know, I think if you speak to her now, she feels&#13;
as good about the partnership as I do, looking into it.&#13;
&#13;
But, you know, I had hoped that in the year after my chairmanship, that would be the gift that the&#13;
Staff Association would give to the staff. Instead, they gave a gym bag.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh.&#13;
&#13;
SOI'HER: I mean, you know, a lot of staff have bought it. You know, I go to people's homes&#13;
and it's sitting there on their ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I have one myself.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah, and, you know, they bought it at the bookstore price. A lot of people have&#13;
told me when they hear that, you know, I had to do with it that it really gave them a shot in the&#13;
arm. It made them feel very good about who they were, what they were doing and what the&#13;
instiltution they were working for was doing. And the biggest set of buyers were managers.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the Bank did put out a much more expensive, glossier book with a lot more professional&#13;
photos, but you've never seen a copy of it.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: No, possibly not.&#13;
&#13;
SOJPHER: I've seen a couple of copies of it. Nobody bought it. They took it to Heidelberg.&#13;
They were trying to retail it for $80 a copy. We took ours to Heidelberg, and we retailed it for&#13;
$40 a copy. We were sold out, had no stock left to replenish. By the end of the Heidelberg fair,&#13;
they were giving it away.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, just for the record, the book Jamil is referring to, even in this simpler&#13;
version, is a really--it's a hardback, large-format book with color illustrations.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: A really nicely-done book, so worth looking at for sure.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yup, but I'm very proud of that, Chuck, because it embodies my feeling to the&#13;
institution. And, you know, I hope that if people look at it and they remember it that, you know,&#13;
maybe they'll understand that that was me.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Good, good. It was a very worthwhile project, too, because I do have a copy. I've&#13;
looked at it. And I know the Archives of the World Bank has a copy, so anybody reading this&#13;
oral history can go and have a look at it.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah, and the title is Our Dream: A World Free of Poverty and, you know, that's&#13;
why I came to the Bank. That's what I wanted to do. That's why the institution means so much&#13;
tome.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What other issues of significance occupied your attention during your time as&#13;
Chairman? I know you've mentioned to me the introduction of SAP [Systems, Applications and&#13;
Products in Data Processing software].&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Basically, ifl look at my two years, the first eighteen months were really good. I&#13;
was able to work on a lot of stuff that meant a lot to me and where I think the staff benefited.&#13;
The final six months of my time were really very bad, and bad in a lot of ways.&#13;
&#13;
First, with the 2 percent pay increase, management essentially shot the legs out from under me.&#13;
And, you know, I had several ways of approaching this. I could have gone public and said, "This&#13;
is awful," but I couldn't see how that was going to help anything. It would just get me into a&#13;
fight that I knew I wasn't going to win. And maybe if I had been strident enough, it would make&#13;
me llook credible to my constituents, but what about, you know, the institution?&#13;
&#13;
And I basically said to Jim--he called me the morning that this was going to the Board, and he&#13;
said, "I gather you're very unhappy about this."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "You've shot me; I'm useless. I mean, the message that I get is that the Fund values its&#13;
staff far more than the Bank does. And, you know, you've got a guy who's tried to collaborate&#13;
with you, and you've just shot him out of the water. You know, so I'm not even going to go up to&#13;
the Board for this, and I'm not going to give an answer or a response. This is going to be very&#13;
quiet because I don't want to undermine the institution, but basically you've turned me into a&#13;
lame duck."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   99&#13;
&#13;
Well, you know, Jim was very, very nice for the next few weeks and months. And he invited me&#13;
up to the Board several days into the new fiscal year where he made the statement, he said,&#13;
"Look, you know, things have to change up here in the Board Room. What the staff is telling me&#13;
is that we don't appreciate them as much as the Fund appreciates their staff, and that's what all&#13;
the operative"--but, you know, he could say that all he wants. The damage was done.&#13;
&#13;
And he asked me, he said, "How did you feel about my statement?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Jim, the damage has been done. So, you know, you're basically dealing with a lame&#13;
duck."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "You know, I'm sad about that."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, you know, the damage has been done." I thought the 2 percent increase took its&#13;
toll on my credibility.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, was this pushed by management or was it Board pressure? It's usually a&#13;
combination of things, of course.&#13;
&#13;
SOFâ&#128;¢HER: My personal view, okay--you never know exactly. You know, when I was speaking&#13;
with the people in Compensation, they were telling me that the numbers were robust enough so&#13;
that if we-if we had our increase according to the new system, we would have gotten 6 percent,&#13;
and then subtracting the amount by which we had been overpaid--according to the new system--&#13;
was something like about 1.7, so we would have come out at 4.3. And I was feeling pretty good&#13;
about that. Then the next thing I know is that they've jiggered the numbers and the numbers&#13;
now called for 0.7, and with the comparator increase and the subsequent adjustment, it came out&#13;
to 2 .&#13;
&#13;
What I believe is that the Board never weighed in on this, and I believe that the people in HR&#13;
who were the key decision-makers took their own measure of the Board, decided that 2 percent&#13;
was the maximum they could go, and they fiddled the system to make the numbers come out,&#13;
okay. I have no way of knowing that. It's a terrible thing to say, but I really believe that the&#13;
working level had a lot to do with jimmying the numbers so that they came out and gave this&#13;
outcome that they believed was what the Board wanted.&#13;
&#13;
I asked Mr. [Jannes] Hutagalung, who was the head ofthe Personnel Committee ofthe Board ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: He's from Indonesia, right?&#13;
&#13;
SOJPHER: He's from Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
And I asked him two years later, in Indonesia, okay, so, you know, it wouldn't taint this. But I&#13;
said, "Had there ever been discussions?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18,2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               100&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He said, "No." And he said, "We were under the impression that they were going to come in&#13;
with a higher number because with all of the reform fatigue that was going on in the Bank, we&#13;
figun~d that they wouldn't dare give the Bank 4 percent less than the Fund was giving."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So this is where, you know, I come to believe that it was, you know, human beings in Personnel&#13;
who made the decision that, you know, this is what they could get away with and, you know,&#13;
after that they would have a robust system.&#13;
&#13;
I hope I'm wrong about that. I hope that there actually was some discussion with the Board. I&#13;
hope there actually was some, you know, higher management and Board involvement because,&#13;
you lmow, it was a very bad decision, and I hope that it wasn't a decision that was abdicated.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: We also ...&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Now, SAP.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: All right. If I thought that the pay increase undermined me, nothing undermined me&#13;
the way SAP did.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, for the record, SAP is ...&#13;
&#13;
SOI'HER: It is the Bank's internal [software] system, and to give a little bit ofbackground, you&#13;
know, the Bank had something like over a hundred legacy systems. Every time there was a type&#13;
of, kind of information that we needed, a new system sprung up, and a lot of them were home-&#13;
grown. And the biggest problem with it is that the numbers that fed each system were&#13;
inconsistent.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: These are internal management systems of various sorts?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Exactly. Now, you had people in senior management who, in my opinion, were&#13;
quite good, people like Mark Baird, like Jim Wolfensohn, even Sven was very numerical, you&#13;
know, wanting to be able to look at numbers to derive information and make decisions. And it&#13;
frustrated the daylights out of them that the--you know, they'd look at one set of numbers and see&#13;
one story, and then the next day, in making a different decision, they'd look at a different set of&#13;
numbers and, you know, the same parameters would be dramatically different from one set to the&#13;
next. Now this was late '97, early '98, so that's when they made the decision: "We have to scrap&#13;
this and we have to go to an integrated system that takes account of the entire Bank."&#13;
&#13;
The second thing that they were concerned about--and I think this was right-headed--was that our&#13;
assistant-level staff was spending 80 to 90 percent of their time feeding these multiple systems,&#13;
to the point where they couldn't do real work and they couldn't really help staff members, you&#13;
know, who they were there to serve.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher        .&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November I 8, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 101&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, so they decided that what you needed was something that was relatively simple to feed,&#13;
but where, you know, one feeding would feed, you know, all ofthe information needs.&#13;
&#13;
All right. Now, to the credit ofiSG [Information Solutions Group]--or whatever they were;&#13;
whatever acronym they were at the time--they put together a bunch of committees of users to&#13;
help them design this new and integrated system, and I think that was the right thing to do. But&#13;
having been asked to serve on a couple of these committees, first as a representative of&#13;
Operations and then as a representative of the Staff Association, I can tell you that discussing&#13;
stufflike this in the abstract does not work. So, you know, from that point of view, there's really&#13;
an issue of were we churning when we were meeting. I remember sitting in meeting after&#13;
meetilng being asked, "Well, what sort of reports would you like?" I had no idea what sort of&#13;
reports I would like. All I knew was that if I had a report that gave me certain numbers that, you&#13;
know, I'd use it.&#13;
&#13;
Then the third thing that happened was a decision that made sense five years later but at the time&#13;
was terrible, and that was that assistants would be expressly forbidden to fill out the system for&#13;
operational--you know, the senior level of Operations. And what happened was the Bank ground&#13;
to a halt. People didn't even know how to fill out a time sheet, it was so complicated. But the&#13;
worst thing of all was that people would spend hours trying to fill out a travel request, so that&#13;
missions actually got delayed. And the amount of anger that was leveled at just about&#13;
everybody--SAP was introduced on July 1, and by the beginning of October they were angry at&#13;
everybody.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: This was 1999?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: 1999. Now, they were very angry at me because I didn't stop this thing, but how&#13;
could anyone stop it? The only thing that somebody might have been able to do would have&#13;
been to delay the introduction by a year so that there was better training, maybe even run the new&#13;
system in parallel with the old legacy systems for a while so that we would become comfortable&#13;
with it. But, you know, we decided not to do that because what the state of the art was at the&#13;
time was that organizations that ran systems in parallel usually did a very bad job of&#13;
impl,ementing them. So, you know--but the angst that this caused throughout the institution was&#13;
terrible.&#13;
&#13;
And I can tell you at this point it does work and it works very smoothly to the extent that the unit&#13;
I'm part of as a retiree consultant--you know, they don't even think twice about it. You know,&#13;
loggilng into SAP and doing the two or three things you have to do in SAP is, you know, very&#13;
matk~r of fact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Am I correct in recalling it's a German system initially, from Germany?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: SAP is probably some German acronym?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: It's some German acronym. And it's mostly manufacturing, so, you know, they tried&#13;
to redesign a lot of the formats and the visuals for our company, but, you know, there was still&#13;
this manufacturing bias.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You were talking about SAP when I had to change the tape.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah. See, I mean the general message to give here is that when you have a broad-&#13;
based reform that cuts up and down an organization and you overlay on top of it this change in&#13;
systems with the kind of disruption that the change introduced, you know, the level of&#13;
unhappiness that you create is massive.&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, I wound up being the target of a lot of unhappiness because people felt as&#13;
though I had simply laid down and, you know, didn't protect the staff with regard to this thing.&#13;
And what I learned from that was that I could have recovered from the 2 percent increase&#13;
because, you know, that was, quote, "merely an issue of pay," unquote. But this affected people&#13;
in terms of the very reason that they were at the Bank, their abiiity to do their jobs. And that, in&#13;
my opinion, created much more of a trauma, an institutional trauma, than anything else. It's not&#13;
an accident that. the-that I believe the next attitude survey was somewhere in the spring of&#13;
2000, and that really was the most negative of all.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I do think that staff have a misperception about what the Staff Association is&#13;
capable of doing. I mean, you and I both know if management reallywants to do something,&#13;
they are going to do it, no matter what.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, you know, you and I talked a lot when we were at the Staff Association about&#13;
the dilemma that we faced between leading and representing. Basically, at the Bank there are&#13;
people who are unhappy, and they want to hear their unhappiness reflected through official&#13;
pronouncements ofthe Staff Association. The problem is that if you reflect people's unhappiness&#13;
too much, you get nothing done. Nobody in a management position really wants to deal with cry&#13;
babies, you know, or people who are simply there to complain and, you know, who are in it for&#13;
the rhetoric. On the other hand, if you don't reflect some of the angst in the system, then you&#13;
wind up losing your ability to represent. And what I found was that the two years of reform were&#13;
so demanding that I wound up doing leadership almost exclusively and much, much less&#13;
representing.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: When you say "reform," that was during the human resources reforms.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah, but the human resources reforms ran all the way through SAP, which meant&#13;
my entire two year term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now,. is the Bank better off for it, for that whole thing? I believe so. I think that as an institution&#13;
we're doing some very good work today. You know, I see it as a long-term retiree consultant,&#13;
and I also see it in a different capacity as the principal of a rice processing mill in Indonesia.&#13;
And, you know, what I can tell you from both the Indonesia experience and from the feasibility&#13;
study I did in China for a waste water treatment plant, the Bank has a higher profile today than it&#13;
did ten years ago and it's much better regarded today than it was ten years ago. So, you know,&#13;
there was--there is certainly a result, but the process was not a kind one in getting from here to&#13;
there. Now, maybe it couldn't have been kind.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing was that, you know, I exposed myself to a level of risk, and, you know, I didn't&#13;
fare very well with some of it.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In the context of the HR reforms, you did mention to me offline that management&#13;
erred in its decision not to permit staff who had taken a redundancy package to come back as&#13;
consultants or in other cases only to come back for less time than needed. You've also&#13;
commented on the fact that many of the new, younger people corning in subsequent to the HR&#13;
reforms are very good but completely lacking in guidance. Do you want to expand on that,&#13;
perhaps, a little bit?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, you know, what's interesting is that to me I thought that this one feature of the&#13;
refmm was the biggest single mistake built into the reform, and it's also the feature of the reform&#13;
that benefited me the most. Let me just give an example.&#13;
&#13;
In financial management, which is the field that I've participated in for the last three years, the&#13;
Bank offered a bunch of redundancy packages to anywhere between ten and fifteen people, you&#13;
know, who took them.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In that discipline, you mean?&#13;
&#13;
SQJ&gt;HER: In that discipline. Of course, it was a fledgling discipline at the time. Each and&#13;
every single one of those ten to fifteen people is more qualified than me when it comes to&#13;
financial management.&#13;
&#13;
When the Bank woke up at the end of2002 and determined--sorry, FY '02, June 2002--and&#13;
determined that, you know, the people that we had who were young, very talented and very&#13;
green, very raw, okay, didn't have the knowledge of the Bank to be--a sufficient knowledge of&#13;
the Bank to be effective, so they were beginning to look for people who could mentor, you know,&#13;
who would be able to help integrate them into the Bank and mainstream them, they couldn't go&#13;
to those ten or fifteen people who were better qualified than me, so they carne to me. And I've&#13;
thrived for the last three-and-a-half years in this discipline that I didn't know very well at the&#13;
time. I still don't know it as well as maybe I need to, but I've helped an enlightened manager&#13;
become, you know, the only one to have, you know, truly mainstream financial management in&#13;
the Bank. And, you know, it didn't have to be that way.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The Bank could have made it easier on itself and had access to more experienced&#13;
talent if they had just gone at it a slightly different way.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: There's a certain pettiness, Chuck, that goes into saying, you know, "If I'm going to&#13;
cut you loose, I don't want you benefiting two or three different ways." That is very petty.&#13;
&#13;
I kept asking senior management, and in one case Jim W olfensohn directly, I said, "Please, stop&#13;
thinking about, you know, whether the people who leave are milking at the trough; think about&#13;
what you're doing to the people left behind."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: "Are you providing them or are you denying them resources that they really need?"&#13;
&#13;
And they said, "Look, you know, we hear you, but we can't deal with that." So they didn't.&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, here I am; it's now five and a half years later, but really three and a half years&#13;
after I started in financial management and, you know, I'rri doing well as a financial management&#13;
person.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: As Chairman of the Staff Association, you were often involved in consultations&#13;
with management, as we've been discussing this afternoon. What strategies did you use in&#13;
engaging in these consultations? I remember that you used to say that we should be, quote,&#13;
"relentless and boring," unquote, in these consultations.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: That was one approach, and the other approach that I tried to use was always think&#13;
about what we're discussing from their point of view and try to find a commonality of interests.&#13;
First of all, you win nothing, zero, if you're not relentless and boring, okay. If you're too&#13;
interesting, okay, you lose because you represent a threat. If you fail to be relentless, it really is&#13;
a paim for managers to, you know, deviate from what they perceive as being their brilliant ideas.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And you were relentless [both talking at the same time]-you were relentless, too,&#13;
because I can remember sitting in various meetings and you would start on something and I'd&#13;
say, "Okay, I know what Jamil is going to say." And I could go almost word for word in my&#13;
own mind what was going to come out, and usually it was pretty spot-on there.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: But, you know, I mean to me relentless and boring is a feature of good management.&#13;
It is very, very easy to drop the other person's interest if the other person isn't there representing&#13;
his interest on a regular basis.&#13;
&#13;
The thing that's a lot harder and--you know, if I think in terms of the Staff Association over the&#13;
27 years or so that I've been at the Bank, it has been led by moderates only for about six or seven&#13;
of the years during that period. And I believe that the moderates accomplished during the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                105&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
periods that they were in the lead in large part because they were able to frame their needs, the&#13;
requirements of the staff, in the context of the interests of the managers who were making these&#13;
decisions. To me, that's the only way you can sell something.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What effect, if any, do you feel that being Chairman of the Staff Association had&#13;
on your subsequent career in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, it was a big negative. First of all, you know, during the two years that I was&#13;
spending as Staff Association Chair, I didn't really think a lot about what I wanted to do&#13;
afterwards. As it got closer and closer to the end of my term, I came to see I didn't have a job.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I could have gone back to my job in East Asia, but, you know, being a task manager in&#13;
energy, after you've been part of senior management for two years, it's very hard to go back to it.&#13;
So one of the things--I had several discussions with the East Asia management, and I said, "I&#13;
can't really come back to this job because it's--you know, it's a transition that would be&#13;
impossible."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: They were supposed to hold a job for you?&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: When you go into Chairman of the Staff Association, they will hold the position for&#13;
you to come back to.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Exactly, and they did hold it, but the problem was I had grown during that two years.&#13;
And, in my opinion, any Chair grows because you get to see a dimension of the Bank that you&#13;
have no other way of seeing. So, you know, to go right back into the exact same job that you&#13;
were in when you left--first of all, you're at a huge disadvantage because the contacts are no&#13;
longer the contacts. You're at a huge disadvantage because the internal processes you follow are&#13;
no longer the internal processes that you knew.&#13;
&#13;
And the other thing is that, you know, you're reliving the glory days all the time. You know,&#13;
you're sitting there waiting for the phone to ring and for it to be Shengman Zhang, and instead it's&#13;
somebody who, you know, is having difficulty with a piece of paper. You know, it's a very, very&#13;
diffiicult transition to make.&#13;
&#13;
Now, during the time that I was really engaged in the Staff Association job, I could not think&#13;
through what I wanted to do afterwards. And as a result, you know, I approached a couple of&#13;
vice: presidents afterwards, and I said, "You know, I've come to know you through this job, and&#13;
I'd really like to work with you." And, you know, at that time it was when budgets were at their&#13;
tightest. And they said, "Look, you know, we do like you, but we don't have anything for you."&#13;
QAG recruited me.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: That's the Quality Assurance Group.&#13;
&#13;

                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 106&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah, and I wound up going there after the Staff Association.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: In your view, Jamil--and you've touched on this throughout this discussion, but just&#13;
kind of as a summary: what is your view of the appropriate role ofthe Staff Association?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: First of all, it's easier for me to define what the Staff Association should not be. It&#13;
should not be a union, and the reason it should not be is because I honestly believe that the vast&#13;
majority ofBan1( staff think of themselves as being members of the Bank first and members of&#13;
the staff second. I honestly believe that Bank staff--the majority of Bank staff will not&#13;
implement a job action if the Staff Association calls for it. And I also ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And you may recall that in 1985, I believe it was ..&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: .. there was a job action, and a lot of staff stayed out one day ..&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: .. but it petered out after that. So we have empirical evidence that what you say is&#13;
true.&#13;
&#13;
SOI'HER: See, the problem is that, you know, there are people who say, "We want you guys to&#13;
be confrontational." But what is confrontation? I mean, if confrontation is slipping our own&#13;
heads in a noose and hanging ourselves, well, you know, I'm not sure that that does any good for&#13;
the other guy, but it sure doesn't do any good for us. So, you know, to me this is airy-fairy stuff.&#13;
&#13;
Now, there are two areas that I think the Staff Association should have a major input in. One of&#13;
them is our conditions of employment. You know, one of the problems with having a l9t of the&#13;
ENTJ s [Myers-Briggs personality type] in management is that they conceptualize what they&#13;
think we need without talking to us about maybe what do we think we need. So I think it's&#13;
important that the dialogue be conducted, you know, with the people, you know, who are directly&#13;
affe,cted by the policies that the Bank is putting in place.&#13;
&#13;
But the second thing where I think the Staff Association should play a role and it has not except&#13;
for brief periods during my administration is how we perform our jobs. It's more than first-class&#13;
travel, okay. It's what kind of resources are available to us in the performance of our jobs. The&#13;
reason I thin1( that that's so important again comes back to the notion that we are members of the&#13;
World Bank first and we are driven as a group to try to do the most effective job we possibly can&#13;
in meeting the Bank's mission of, you know, a world free of poverty. So, you know, the thing&#13;
that strikes me is that a lot of the people who are making resource decisions never bother to talk&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  107&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to the: people who do the work. A lot of managers--I want to be very careful to distinguish&#13;
because there are some managers who are exceptionally good and they do ask the right sets of&#13;
questions--but a lot of managers don't ask their staff what to do. So, I mean, it strikes me that the&#13;
Staff Association is positioned to foster that kind of discussion.&#13;
&#13;
Now,, you may remember that when I was Chair, one of the things that I would do would be to&#13;
have discussions, you know, between the delegates from a given VPU [Vice Presidential Unit]&#13;
and their vice president on a fairly regular, almost quarterly basis. That was where we were able&#13;
to give feedback on how the work was done. And, you know, sometimes it was as small as, you&#13;
know, the organization ofthe files, but often it had to do with, you know, what resources do we&#13;
need in order to optimize our ability to cut and paste from other things.&#13;
&#13;
One of the days that I remember was--it was one of my wonderful days as Chair--was that we&#13;
met with the--the ECA [Europe and Central Asia] representatives met with Johannes [F.] Linn,&#13;
and it was a disaster of a meeting. I mean, it was one of the worst meetings that I've ever&#13;
attended because Johannes could not resist the temptation to talk.&#13;
&#13;
At the end of the meeting, Johannes asked if he could see me alone for a few minutes. And he&#13;
said, "Well, what did you think of the meeting?"&#13;
&#13;
And I looked at him and I said, "Johannes, we probably touched on about 70 questions, 70&#13;
issues, and you came up with 70 solutions, and not a single one of them was the right one." And,&#13;
you know, watching him deflate was really good, but it also did make my relationship with him&#13;
for the future.&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Well, what do you mean?''&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Look, if you take all of the stories together, there's a message that you're being given and&#13;
that message is we work in silos that don't talk to each other, and the one thing that we really&#13;
need from management is for you to demand that middle-level managers--that they open up&#13;
some of these silos so that we're talking to one another. Now, this you're hearing from the&#13;
resource management person, who's saying, 'You know, I'm making decisions, but I don't know&#13;
what I'm making them about and I need more contact with the staff.' You're hearing that from&#13;
task team leaders. You're hearing that from country people right here in this room. And what&#13;
you're doing is you're tinkering. You know, you're fixing a little thing here, a little thing there.&#13;
You know, yeah, by the end of it maybe, you know, the plumbing leaks have been fixed, but&#13;
then::'s so much water between, you know, the floor you're on and the floor below that you're&#13;
going to--there's still a lot of damage that's going to get created."&#13;
&#13;
Now, that helped really make my relationship with Johannes Linn, and it also, you know, helped&#13;
him listen better to people who were complaining about the way the work is done.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Did you see subsequent improvements in that region?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   108&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: Absolutely, and I can tell you that I saw a lot of improvement at subsequent&#13;
 meetings because he did a lot more listening and he did a lot more extracting of messages.&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: Along these same lines, Jamil, in your view what are some of the strengths and&#13;
 weaknesses of the Staff Association? Again, we've touched on some of these points throughout&#13;
 this afternoon, but this will give you a chance to summarize.&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: All right. Well, the biggest weakness is that you only hear from people who agree&#13;
 with you. You get very little feedback from people who disagree. The only real piece of&#13;
 feedback you ever get from people who disagree is when they resign, and they don't resign very&#13;
 often .&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: Now, these are your constituents you're talking about, staff members?&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: Exactly, and I'm talking in terms of the feedback that you get through e-mails and&#13;
 phone calls and the like. So it is very easy for a Staff Association Chair or Vice Chair to believe&#13;
 that they're hitting all the right notes, okay. And what winds up happening is that just as they're&#13;
 convinced that they're hitting all the right notes, there's a lot of people in the staff at large who&#13;
 are thinking, "Hey, these guys are a bunch of amateurs."&#13;
&#13;
 So, you know, to me that's by far the biggest weakness because it's just very easy to fall in love&#13;
 with yourself in that job. What you have to do is understand that that's what's happening and you&#13;
 have to make a conscious effort to reach out. I've told you, I think, I had a group of outsiders&#13;
 that I would go to on a regular basis to get their reaction to what was going on. My ground rules&#13;
 with them was, "Don't be kind. Tell me what you really think."&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: Now, these are other staff members outside the Staff Association hierarchy?&#13;
&#13;
  SOPHER: Yes, yeah. They included people like Richard [A.] Cambridge, who, you know, I&#13;
  think is one of the great reader of people in the Bank; Pamela Cox, who subsequently has&#13;
  become a vice president; Van Pulley, who has subsequently become a director. Jeff [Jeffrey]&#13;
  Katz was a frequent consultation of mine, and there were about four or five other people that I&#13;
. would pick up the phone and go to regularly. And I would ask them, I'd say, "You know, you've&#13;
  read this, you've heard this, what do you think?" And, you know, I probably got more of a&#13;
  positive response than I might have if these were people who were hostile to me. But bit by bit, I&#13;
  was also picking up the people who were not particularly friendly. Willem [M.] van Eeghen was&#13;
  one; I respect Willem tremendously. And--but you have to make a very, very strong effort to&#13;
  hear people who are going to be honest with you rather than people who are just going to tell you&#13;
  what you want to hear.&#13;
&#13;
 The second thing is that I think it is very important to have a good set of indicators. I had two&#13;
 indicators when I was running the Staff Association. One indicator was how many members did&#13;
 we have. You remember that I was relentless about membership, and the reason that that was&#13;
 important to me was because it gave me a sense of how well we were representing. Now, I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Jamil Sopher&#13;
                       September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                109&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
contend that if we had 3984 members on the day I took over and we had 5307 on the day I left,&#13;
and there were something like about 12 to 13 hundred people who left in the interim--12 to 13,&#13;
hundred members who left in the interim.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Left the institution?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah. I couldn't have done a very bad job if I brought in something like about 2500&#13;
new members.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: On a net basis?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah, on a gross basis.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay, yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Net was about 1,300.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yeah, yeah, of course.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: So, you know, if there are staff who feel that I got the message wrong, I couldn't&#13;
have gotten it that far wrong to be able to bring in a gross number of--and when I talk about&#13;
5300, I'm not counting, you know, a single member from a field office, which we accounted for&#13;
sepamtely.&#13;
&#13;
Now, that said, the second indicator I used was number of grievances that we had. Now, you&#13;
know, what did I figure out very quickly? If you looked at the Bank's, all of the different parts of&#13;
the Bank's conflict resolution system, that part for at least ten to twelve years prior to my coming&#13;
in very consistently handled between 650 to 675 complaints a year. The Staff Association was&#13;
handlling only 150 of those. We were the instrument that was supposed to be defending the&#13;
interests ofthe staff, and we were only getting a quarter ofthe complaints? You know, others&#13;
were going to the ombudsman; others were going to, you know, appeals; others were--you know,&#13;
why were we             Â·           of them? And so I decided, you know, to spend some time&#13;
sitting in.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So those were the two indicators that I used. Now, I could have used budgetary indicators, but of&#13;
what importance was that? I found out later it was very important, but the fact of it was that with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               110&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
those two indicators I had, you know, two bits of feedback. Number one, was our general&#13;
message two good? Number two, was our level of personal service adequate? Okay.&#13;
&#13;
Now,, the reason that I didn't look at the budget and financial numbers was because I came in and&#13;
we had a war chest of about $900,000, and when I left our war chest was about $1,050,000.&#13;
And, you know, it just didn't seem to me as though there was a lot oftrick to managing the&#13;
mom~y. I mean, if anything we were in a situation where we were--we could spend more than we&#13;
were.&#13;
&#13;
Why did I find out it was so important? Last year, the Staff Association raised their dues for the&#13;
first time in their existence, and the reason they did was because the war chest was down to&#13;
about $400,000. They'd squandered a lot of money.&#13;
&#13;
[Intt~rruption]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: You know, they'd squandered a lot of money, so one ofthe things that I should have&#13;
done was to help draw the relationship between service, message and war chest. I didn't do that.&#13;
&#13;
Now, what is particularly good in the Staff Association? I would say it's less about the Staff&#13;
Association than about the institution. The institution affords a lot of access if you get on the&#13;
same wave length as the people that you're working with. It is remarkable how easy it was to&#13;
pick up the phone and phone Shengman Zhang, Jim Wolfensohn, Richard Stem, any vice&#13;
pres1[dent. Now, was it because of me? Some of it was me, okay. Or was it because ofthe job?&#13;
A lot of it was the job, okay. Now, that means it's a powerful medium for doing good.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay. After you left the Staff Association, your next assignment was in the Quality&#13;
Assurance Group, which is abbreviated Q-A-G, pronounced "kwag." How did you finally wind&#13;
up there? You've mentioned earlier in this interview you were looking around for something&#13;
with various vice presidents, but weren't successful, but you finally wound up in QAG.&#13;
&#13;
SOI'HER: QAG recruited me, and I had fifteen days left in the Staff Association job. I&#13;
basically took it by default.&#13;
&#13;
Now, first of all, I did not properly understand what QAG was about and, you know, from that&#13;
point of view, you know, it's a mistake. And it's not an unhappy mistake, but it was still a&#13;
mistake to go there. I had the idea that what QAG people did was to study fairly closely what's&#13;
going on in the Bank and to, you know, issue assessments. What I didn't understand was that the&#13;
volume of what had to be studied was so large that we essentially became a factory that produced&#13;
pands.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Produced pals?&#13;
&#13;
SOJl'HER: Panels.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                111&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, panels. Sorry.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Panels of three to four people to review a piece of work. And what we did was we&#13;
also produced the logical questionnaire that they would follow. The problem with that--well, no,&#13;
let me start a little bit differently.&#13;
&#13;
When you're in the situation we were, the Bank was in 1996 where we broadly acknowledged&#13;
that one-third of our work was not producing satisfactory results, okay, you need to give it a shot&#13;
in the arm. And the shot in the arm provided by an organization like QAG looking into these&#13;
things and putting a lot of attention into a series of tasks is something that is bound to improve&#13;
the quality of the work that's being done simply by giving attention. No matter how good your&#13;
attention or how bad your attention, you know, it has to produce results.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing, though, is that as people get more and more used to QAG and they can figure&#13;
out how to game the system, an intermediary like QAG becomes another part of the bureaucracy.&#13;
And this is where QAG or others like it really need to appreciate that there's a need that&#13;
transcends simply giving senior management feedback on the state of the Bank's portfolios.&#13;
&#13;
I believe that QAG should have a learning objective. And now, you know, as a result of my&#13;
having been there, they acknowledge it, but they think of it as a secondary objective. They don't&#13;
think of it as a primary objective. And my view of it is that that's unfortunate because, you&#13;
know, one of the biggest problems we have in the Bank is this perception that where--those of us&#13;
doing the work are being overseen by a bunch of policemen. Legal is a bunch of policemen;&#13;
Disbursement is a bunch of policemen; Procurement are a bunch of policemen; in some cases,&#13;
Environment and Social are perceived as a bunch of policemen; and QAG is the super-&#13;
policeman. And to me this is wrong. I mean, I think that what--if senior management would&#13;
take more of an approach to say, "Guys, we're here, of course, to find out how we're doing and&#13;
improve what we're doing, but also we believe that a big part of our improvement is if you learn,&#13;
and we want to help you learn." That would be a big thing.&#13;
&#13;
I think that we've got--you know, back in around 1999, 2000 when, you know, the numbers came&#13;
way up, we got past the point where ratings were important. There are very few 3s in the system&#13;
now.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, the system goes from 1 to ..&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: One to 4, where 1 is superb, 2 is satisfactory, 3 is marginal, and 4 is unsatisfactory.&#13;
And anything that's 3 or 4 is less than satisfactory, and when we were at a point where, you&#13;
know, there were maybe about 5 or 6 percent 1s, about 60 percent 2s and then the rest 3 and 4s,&#13;
then, you know, ratings made a difference. But when you got to the point where between 1 and 2&#13;
you had 97 percent, and only 3 percent were 3s, ratings no longer were important. And what&#13;
wound up happening was that you wound up having incredible political fights because task&#13;
managers who thought they should be 1s got 2s and nobody was ever happy getting a 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     September 2 and 9 and November 18,2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 112&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So, you know, I mean to me the point I'm getting at is that QAG was developed in 1996 for a&#13;
partieular set of problems. It has not changed, and at this point it's a lot more of an imposition on&#13;
the staff than it is a help.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: With these ratings, Jamil, are they reasonably objective? What I'm getting at is&#13;
could some outside--well, you said about 97 percent are 1s and 2s now.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Could some outside person say, "Well, you know, this is just window dressing.&#13;
The Bank is assessing itself and of course they're going to say things are good?" Now, would&#13;
that be a legitimate complaint by an outsider?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: No, and the reason that it wouldn't be is because we never portrayed this as anything&#13;
other than a self-assessment. And we don't go outside the Bank and say, "Our QAG results are .&#13;
. ." Okay. OED [Operations Evaluation Department] is the assessor that gets coverage on the&#13;
outside. Now ...&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And that's always retrospective. You're doing it real-time, essentially.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Exactly, and the idea of being--you know, let's do what we can to improve&#13;
something if it's going off track so that, you know, by the time it gets to OED we've got&#13;
som(~thing that's pretty decent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, the biggest problem that I have with QAG is that you cannot--you know, staff members&#13;
used to serve on panels. It used to be 50 percent were staff members, 50 percent were retiree&#13;
consultants. But at this point, staff members no longer have the time to be on panels. What the&#13;
message really is, is they no longer have the interest to be on panels. It takes a lot of time&#13;
because the time of panelists tends to be way under budget, and there's an awful lot of churning&#13;
of paper that goes on among the panelists. And the upshot of it is that all of these panels are&#13;
being overseen by retiree consultants and they're underpaid because they're being given two days'&#13;
worth of pay to do a five day job. They're not happy about that, so they're looking to cut comers&#13;
and they do cut corners. And the other side to it is some of them never bill, so it looks as though&#13;
QAG is always on target, always on budget. And, you know, to the degree that it should&#13;
perfom1, it doesn't.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: When you went to QAG, what are some of the specific tasks and projects with&#13;
which you were involved?&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Well, the easier way to put it is my first assignment with QAG was to oversee the&#13;
quality of supervision review. And, you know, I recruited panelists and I structured panels and&#13;
we had the drawing for who's going to get reviewed and who isn't and then I retired. So I didn't&#13;
see it all the way through.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                113&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But the thing that-the point that I'm making, Chuck, is that from the point ofview of the people&#13;
working at QAG, it's not a very satisfying intellectual exercise because what you're effectively&#13;
doing is you're developing an assembly line of panels.&#13;
&#13;
Now,, the people who sit on panels are doing interesting work, but they're being underpaid. So,&#13;
you know, I mean from where I see it, I really think it's a wonderful idea that met the conditions&#13;
of the late '90s, but it needs to be rethought.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: It's not as relevant today as it was initially because conditions have changed?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: It may even be relevant today, but its modus operandi needs to be rethought.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, in your CV you note that you strove to reorient QAG's assessment processes&#13;
to make them more staff-friendly. This seems to be in keeping with the emphasis that you placed&#13;
on values, behavior and institutional culture as Staff Association Chairman. Can you talk about&#13;
what you did to make these processes more friendly?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, let me just give you two separate examples.&#13;
&#13;
One was to upgrade the learning objective, and I feel as though I was marginally successful, at&#13;
best, on that. I really believed that QAG would very significantly increase its relevance to the&#13;
organization if it put greater and better emphasis on the learning objective. It would also be less&#13;
negative.&#13;
&#13;
But the second thing was that, you know, QAG would structure this period for conducting&#13;
assessments--quality of supervision was originally done during July and August, but what about&#13;
people's vacations?&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: And Prem [C.] Garg actually asked several task managers to come back from&#13;
vacation so that they could go through the QAG assessment because, you know, they were&#13;
throwing off his schedule. And I looked at Prem, and I said, "Prem, I'm not going to do that." I&#13;
said, "If I'm going to do quality of supervision assessments, it's going to be in September and&#13;
October. Let people have their time."&#13;
&#13;
I remember that there was one particular assessment where I was a panelist. This was on quality&#13;
at entry, not quality of supervision. The project was a dog of a project. It really wasn't very&#13;
good, and we knew that pretty well from all of the evidence. The task manager was a guy named&#13;
James Moose, who had done some work for the Staff Association.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Do you know how to spell that offhand, because we're going to have to put it in the&#13;
transcript?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18,2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     114&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yes, M-0-0-S-E. Jim was a very decent guy. Now, he was on a mission at the&#13;
time. We set the time of the panel interviews as being--! think it was 11 to 1 on the given day,&#13;
for the convenience of the panel. This poor guy was in Moscow, and, you know, there's a time--&#13;
the difference was something like eight hours, so it went from 7 to 9. You know, he finished a&#13;
very tough day in the field, came back to get this going, was doing it entirely by telephone. And&#13;
I thought to myself, "Okay, this is not good." So I insisted--and Prem went along--that we&#13;
should ask Jim to come back to meet with the panel a second time after his return to&#13;
headquarters.&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: But, you know, to bring that to close, he had given a pretty weak defense of some of&#13;
the problems with his project when he was doing it over the phone from Moscow. When he&#13;
came in and met with us at headquarters, he presented a much more lucid picture of what&#13;
happened and whaJ had gone wrong. And, you know, that being the case, you know, that's when&#13;
I began to see that if you give a little bit of attention to the needs of your task team leaders,&#13;
you're going--first of all, you're going to learn a lot more and, second, you're going to be a lot&#13;
fairer in terms of what comes out.&#13;
&#13;
Now, I did in that period come to appreciate that some of the retiree consultants that we were&#13;
using were very good people who had real insight to share with the institution. My favorite&#13;
anec:dote from that period, it is in-it came from a quality at entry panel that I was part of that&#13;
looked at the Kyrgyz transport project.&#13;
&#13;
The Kyrgyz transport project was the procurement manager's dream. It had started as a broad-&#13;
based project that was supposed to have been a structural adjustment loan. It turned out to be a&#13;
very small investment loan which, summarized, is filling pot holes in three separate cities: the&#13;
capital city for three years and each of the two smaller cities for two years each. So how did they&#13;
do it? They had seven internationally competitive bid contracts, you know, one for filling pot&#13;
holes in a given city for a year, and this whole process was overseen by an internationally&#13;
selected consultant.&#13;
&#13;
Now, this was very interesting because the assessment of procurement and financial management&#13;
would have been done ahead of time. So, you know, the panel convened. We convened; we got&#13;
the paper and, you know, very high marks for procurement and very high marks for financial&#13;
management. The task team comes in very buoyant, thinking, you know, they've got a 1; this is&#13;
outstanding stuff. And the panel chair just systematically destroyed them. I mean, her starting&#13;
point was, "What strategic objective did we achieve with this project?"&#13;
&#13;
"Oh, well, you know, we made the road system in these three cities a lot better."&#13;
&#13;
So she said, "No, wait a minute. That may be an outcome of this project, but what did we&#13;
achieve strategically? Did we upgrade any institutions? Did we change any policies? Did we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 115&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
change any operating systems within the country? What have we left behind in the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic other than asphalt?"&#13;
&#13;
And they couldn't answer that. And it turned--you know, by the end of this, not only did they get&#13;
a 3, but the panel had downgraded the procurement and FM assessments ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: FM?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Financial management.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: .. in large part because, you know, instead of enabling them to develop capacity to&#13;
do p:rocurement and FM, we prevented them from doing it and screwing it up.&#13;
&#13;
So, you know, these are the sorts of things where if--now, there was an incredible fight between&#13;
QAG and the region over this because the region felt maligned that they got a 3 on this thing.&#13;
And the entire discussion was over the rating and not at all about the learning which was ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The substantive objections, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOI'HER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Uh-huh, uh-huh. QAG's website states, quote--and this is as of about a month ago,&#13;
I gm~ss ..&#13;
&#13;
SOI,HER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: "In 1996, two out of every six Bank products fell short of the Bank's own high&#13;
standards for quality. By early 2000, that rate had been reduced to one out of every six products.&#13;
The majority of Bank staff and management are not only acutely aware of quality issues, but are&#13;
also contributing substantially to a culture of quality throughout the Bank. Clearly, the QAG&#13;
approach makes a difference." With regard to that last sentence, to what extent can the&#13;
improvement in the quality of products be attributed to the QAG approach?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: From 1996 to 2000, I think it could be in very large part. Why? Because, first of&#13;
all, it made it very clear to staff that senior management was interested in quality. The guidance&#13;
questionnaire that the panels followed, you know, were based on what are factors of quality.&#13;
&#13;
The problem I have is that when you get to the point where not one out of six but, say, one out of&#13;
ten--as little as one out often--is out of sync with what is good quality, then you're in a different&#13;
ball game because you're pushing the envelope. You're trying to make quality better; you're&#13;
trying to get people to think in greater depth; and you're trying to get them to focus on secondary&#13;
and tertiary-level strategic objectives. And you can't do that with a questionnaire that touches&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                116&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
only on the superficial, and you can't do that when you're spending--when your differences of&#13;
opinion concern ratings.&#13;
&#13;
To me, the problem is really with the last sentence because I think what has happened is that&#13;
people have been accustomed to quality. They have taken the QAG questionnaire and used it as&#13;
a guide for doing their projects. And QAG, you know, has not been moving along to deal with&#13;
the next level of issues.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You retired from the Bank in September of 2000.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Were there any particular factors that influenced your decision to do so?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, there were several of them.&#13;
from the    Â·vate sector that was&#13;
                                                                                       quite frankly&#13;
I had come out of a very exciting job at the Staff Association into a job that was not very&#13;
exciting, which left me feeling very frustrated. And I was also taking, you know, a considerable&#13;
hit from Morallina and, you know ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Your successor?                                                                                \J'.l&#13;
                                                                                                      ~fbl&#13;
                                                       .                                            ~&gt;&#13;
SOI'HER: My successor, who basically was running into a lot of difficulty trying to do the job,tla ,;,r~&#13;
and her way of dealing-with it was, you know, to just criticize what came before. So I felt under~~ Â·;;&gt;~z&#13;
sieg(': for a job that I'~ left which I thought I had done prett~ we~l. And, you know, I had this jo'~&#13;
that was very frustratmg, and I wanted out, and I wanted th1s pnvate sector offer to be as good as'~&#13;
it sounded.&#13;
&#13;
It turned out that, you know, I learned a lot&#13;
                 do have it at the B&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Six months after I retired, the company split up, and I was given an offer that wasn't particularly&#13;
attractive to go with one of the branches of the company. And at that point I decided, "No, this&#13;
is nuts. On the one hand, I have the benefit of collecting my pension so, you know, I've got a&#13;
regular income that's maybe not all that I need, but it was pretty good. Let me go back with the&#13;
Bank, and let me start working things out."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So between April2001 and January 2002, you returned to QAG as a consultant?&#13;
&#13;
SOJPHER: It was really to June 2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: But, you know, I was subcontracted to LAC from January to June. It wasn't&#13;
exclusively LAC. I would do--l did something like 72 days during that period for LAC and the&#13;
rest for QAG. So--but, you know, I mean I have to--there are two or three things I have to be&#13;
very thankful to QAG about. First of all, I was the day-to-day manager for an assessment of&#13;
fiduciary ES\V, and it was in that context that I got to know what was going on in financial&#13;
management and I was able to tie up with the financial management sector.&#13;
&#13;
The young man that--I sat on his panel, the one who wound up hiring me into LAC on a full-time&#13;
basis--I gave him a 3. And he was pretty upset by this and he came back to me and he said,&#13;
"Why did you give me a 3?" And I sat down with him for about two hours, and at the end of it&#13;
he looked at me and said, "You know, you're absolutely right, I deserve a 3, but there are about&#13;
three or four places where I'd appreciate it if you change the wording because it's not me that's&#13;
getting the 3, it's really, you know, the region." And I changed the wording. And that was in&#13;
November of'Ol--sorry--of'02.&#13;
&#13;
In May of '03, I got a call from him. I never expected to hear from him again. And he said to&#13;
me, he said, "Can I have lunch with you?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "I'm delighted."&#13;
&#13;
So I had lunch with him and he said, "You know, I've just been selected the financial&#13;
management manager for LAC, and, you know, I found that out earlier today, and my first&#13;
decision is I'd like to hire you as my consultant because if you can make me understand what the&#13;
product is as well as you could, then you can make the others understand."&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Who were some of the individuals whom you found particularly noteworthy during&#13;
your QAG experience?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, I mean to be very clear about it, it is impossible not to consider Prem Garg to&#13;
be a noteworthy person. And I mean, on balance I really like him a lot. He helped me twice&#13;
when I really needed it, and he didn't have a very strong reason to do it either time. Once was&#13;
when I was leaving the Staff Association and I really needed a job and he offered me one. He&#13;
offered one without my even asking for it, and, you know, so I really appreciated that. And then&#13;
the other was, you know, after this disastrous period in, you know, in that private business. I was&#13;
very open with Prem. I came back to see him, and I said, "Look, this has been a mistake and,&#13;
you know, I'd like it if you'd make it possible for me to come back," and he took me back.&#13;
&#13;
Now, he and I disagreed a lot subsequently. I really believe that these were very honest&#13;
disagreements. I think that, you know, Prem is--you know, he's a very, very intelligent guy for&#13;
whom I have the world of respect, but he has the difficulty that many people do about moving&#13;
away from a successful formula. The QAG formula was so good from '96 to '00--really, from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
'96 to '01, it was relevant, it was spot-on, it did a lot to improve the Bank, that for him to depart&#13;
from it to do something new was extremely difficult.&#13;
&#13;
Othe:rs that I really--you know, it's interesting because the ones you consider to be the really&#13;
good panelists you work with at the time, later it turns out that, you know, maybe there are others&#13;
who were better. But my personal respect for Jane [E.] Loos and Ram [Kumar] Chopra is huge.&#13;
I had known Jane before, but I didn't see her as being, you know, that major a person.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: And that's spelled?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: L-0-0-S.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: And Ram was a manager who I liked personally, but I didn't take seriously. But&#13;
then when I worked with Ram at QAG, I came to realize this guy has wonderful, wonderful&#13;
personal qualities.&#13;
&#13;
Dan [Daniel] Ritchie is another fellow that I came to appreciate big time. His style--you know,&#13;
being able to draw out the best in people he's assessing--was really good.&#13;
&#13;
There were a number of others, but largely, you know, aside from Prem, who so totally&#13;
dom;[nates--oh, Bob [RobertS.] Drysdale, who also worked for QAG; he was a QAG consultant&#13;
like][ was, as opposed to a panelist. I just think that Bob Drysdale is, you know, one of the more&#13;
amazingly well-rounded human beings I've ever met, a great thinker and a great--he has a&#13;
wonderful sense of what is real quality.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: You touched on quite a bit. Is there anything you want to say in summary form&#13;
about particular lessons for the institution (that is to say, the World Bank) that you noted from&#13;
your time in QAG?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah, and I mean the main issue is that we don't only need to address failure. We&#13;
also have to address success, okay. When we do things very well, things are going to wind up&#13;
improving and the relevance of the approach that we bring is going to be nullified because of&#13;
success. And there we need to make adjustments to the way we handle things.&#13;
&#13;
And I think that we--you know, that is just as true with regard to the Bank's products that have&#13;
been upgraded as a result of QAG's presence and the fear that some people have of QAG as it is&#13;
for QAG itself, which needed to start thinking--one change that they did make that I pushed very,&#13;
very hard for (and I was not alone in pushing) was that now they have begun evaluating country&#13;
programs as a whole rather than just simply individual ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  119&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 SOPHER: .. projects. And I thought that that was essential because the country is the unit of&#13;
 account in the Bank, so how is it that it doesn't have similar standing at QAG?&#13;
&#13;
 The other thing is that, you know, it is very possible--I saw it happen in the Philippines where&#13;
 you can have a collection of highly satisfactory endeavors but a country program that's not doing&#13;
 very well. So, you know, I mean this was one of the things that I thought needed to be improved.&#13;
&#13;
 But there's others that I think are necessary, and the most important thing is that now that quality&#13;
 is broadly considered to be an important aspect to Bank staff, I think we've got to do away with&#13;
 these ratings because these ratings are now a distraction. There is the opportunity to upgrade the&#13;
 work of the Bank by having dialogue among good panels and good staff about what constitutes&#13;
 quality, and then there is the opportunity to upgrade some more by having a dialogue between&#13;
 good panelists and weak staff about how they can bring up their rank. But it needs to be done in&#13;
 the context of learning.&#13;
&#13;
 ZIEGLER: From January 2002 to the present, you've been working for the Latin America and&#13;
 Caribbean Regional Financial Management Unit focusing on country financial accountability&#13;
 assessments, and also reports on the observance of accounting and auditing standards and codes.&#13;
 Is there anything in particular that you would like to relate about the work you've been doing&#13;
 recently?&#13;
&#13;
 SOI'HER: Well, yeah. I mean, you know, we've touched on it and we've touched on it in a&#13;
 number of different ways, Chuck.&#13;
&#13;
First, you know, when the Bank gets rid of a lot of corporate history and replaces it with people&#13;
who have very limited experience within the institution, there's a need to mentor these people.&#13;
Wh~m I first arrived at the Bank, I received virtually no mentoring. But what I did receive--the&#13;
benefit I did get--was that I joined a unit where I'd walk outside of my door and there would be&#13;
some people there who had been with the institution for ten years, others fifteen, and still others&#13;
two. And we'd exchange ideas, and I'd learn the institution as I went along. I couldn't have&#13;
functioned very well ifl didn't know financial analysis very well. But, you know, I could learn&#13;
what the institution needed, what was the business of the institution, and I could make a&#13;
contribution. When the people currently don't have that kind of corporate history, they're going&#13;
to flounder, and that's what happened.&#13;
&#13;
 Now, any time you draw in a new discipline into the Bank--and my favorite is to look at it from&#13;
 the point of--procurement was there when I arrived. Cofinancing became one in the early '80s.&#13;
 Environment became hot in the late '80s; social in the early '90s. Financial management was&#13;
 introduced in the late 1990s. You have to expect that it's going to take five years to mainstream&#13;
 that new discipline. And, you know, it's going to be rocky, and the onus has got to be on the&#13;
 people in the new discipline to mainstream themselves, to find aÂ·way that they can fit into what&#13;
Â·the rest of the institution is doing. In any new discipline, there's a five year grace period where&#13;
 the product is financed centrally, but after that five years, you know, you can't expect a continued&#13;
 central tax-okay--to finance that unit and that product. Social--things like resettlement,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Jamil Sopher&#13;
                      September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               120&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
indigenous people, you name it--very successfully mainstreamed itself in five years. It took the&#13;
full five years, but they were successful about it.&#13;
&#13;
Financial management really started as a central Bank activity in 1997, and by 2002 it couldn't&#13;
have been further from being mainstreamed than it was. They were still--you know, they were&#13;
still thought of as policemen, fiduciaries who were there to be a pain in the ass--sorry--and who,&#13;
you know, when we did our country-level work, we would disrupt ongoing relationships and do&#13;
a lousy job. It was very difficult for the financial management people to understand this because&#13;
they would come out and they'd do these country financial accountability assessments and there&#13;
was jiust endless, boring descriptions of financial management practices. And they thought,&#13;
"Isn'lt this wonderful? We've done this beautifully." But they couldn't fathom the notion that this&#13;
has to be useful to somebody. And the economists who were trying to deal with issues of&#13;
poverty and issues of public sector management and issues of gender equality and, you name it,&#13;
okay, couldn't care less about reading an endless, boring tract that describes how a treasury&#13;
single account works-okay--and that was-that was the job.&#13;
&#13;
Now, today financial management has been very successfully mainstreamed in LAC. There are&#13;
maybe one or two country directors who still think of us as a policeman, but virtually all of the&#13;
working-level people understand what we do, and in large part because we forced a number of&#13;
behavioral changes.&#13;
&#13;
I believe that financial management is also reasonably advanced in terms of mainstreaming in&#13;
ECA. It is nowhere near in many of the other regions. Now, what have the other regions done?&#13;
In the case of East Asia, they've just put it squarely under PREM [Poverty Reduction and&#13;
Economic Management], and the PREM Network tells the financial management specialists&#13;
what they're going to do and what they won't. And it has pretty well marginalized them from&#13;
intellectual work, but when it comes to fiduciary, they are there. In South Asia, it's pretty much&#13;
the same thing. They're not very effective there, but they're getting better. And MENA [Middle&#13;
East and North Africa] and Africa: disaster. Africa--they still can't understand why everyone&#13;
isn't interested in these lengthy and boring descriptions and why nobody wants to finance&#13;
changes. I don't even know what they're doing in MENA.&#13;
&#13;
But the point is that LAC is well along. I mean, there's an OED study ongoing now, and they&#13;
have taken to talking with us very extensively, you know, to try to help them think through&#13;
problems because--and they've pretty much said to us that, you know, we're the only unit that&#13;
they feel they can talk with because, you know, we have done what needs to be done in the rest&#13;
ofthe Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Okay. The following points will be basically to kind of wrap and summary&#13;
questions.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 121&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Would you care to reflect on the evolution of the World Bank's institutional culture&#13;
as you saw it during your career in the Bank? You've been in the Ban1c for a good twenty-some&#13;
years, and that might be an interesting topic for you to talk about a little bit.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Well, you know, in a nutshell I can tell you. From '79 to '86, it was a very pleasant,&#13;
sleepy sort of place where you could do a lot of good work and you had a lot of time to do in-&#13;
depth, quality thinking. You had a lot of resources to do it. Technology wasn't as good as it&#13;
was, so you spent a lot of time on your own overseas. And, you know, because people didn't get&#13;
on each other's cases very much, there was a lot of bon ami within the institution, a lot of feeling&#13;
of family, you know, among people within the unit. And as you went out from the unit, there&#13;
was still a lot of goodwill within your departmental and regional structures.&#13;
&#13;
From '87 to '97 was really a very un1dnd time. Now, you could do your work and you could&#13;
flourish, but it was usually at somebody else's expense. And the--you know, the premium&#13;
became--you only got promoted--first of all, it became a major thing you have to get promoted&#13;
because that was an indicator of how well your satrap functioned, your satrapy. And to get&#13;
promoted, you had to be noticed, and the best way to be noticed was to criticize. And the shriller&#13;
your criticism, the more you'd get noticed. And it was really very, very bad. I mean, the story I&#13;
recounted today about Callisto was for me personally where the change first manifested itself.&#13;
And I still regard Callisto as a hero because, you know, he was willing to take the bull by the&#13;
horns and say, "This is unacceptable," when it was standard operating procedure in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Today, I think the Bank is much more of a service organization, and I think a lot of it came about&#13;
because of the changes that were led but not entirely due to the human resources reform. I thin1&lt;.&#13;
a lot of it had to do with the jawboning frbm Jim Wolfensohn and the executive development&#13;
program that really focused a lot of managers on what is a service organization.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Service, you mean, to the clients of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: To the client, yeah. It became a lot less "me," a lot less "us," a lot more "them," and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Which is something Jim was trying to push for for a long time.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah. I really do think that it's been a big advantage to have more staff in the field&#13;
so that there can be a more frequent dialogue between ourselves and our clients and the client's&#13;
point of view gets picked up a lot better.&#13;
&#13;
One of the things that's very interesting today is Argentina. I do a lot of work there, and, you&#13;
know, in 2002 Argentina broke just about every rule in the book. Now, Argentina has not&#13;
collapsed, and the World Bank is not gone from there, and that is in large part because of the&#13;
client focus that we've developed. Everything we do in Argentina we do with a certain level of&#13;
trepidation because we don't know how it's going to play because, you know, we're making up&#13;
the rules as we're going along. But at the same time, you know, we're helping development in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18,2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               122&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
doing that. So, you know, I really believe that the culture is improved, and improved in a major&#13;
way, okay.&#13;
&#13;
Now, do I think the Banlc is more effective, less effective? I don't know, because I really do&#13;
believe that the Bank takes on the personality of whoever runs it. You know, it was McNamara,&#13;
then it was Ernie Stem. Clausen didn't really count. After the reorganization of '87, it took on&#13;
the personality ofMoeen and then back to Ernie, okay. And then from '95 to 2005, it took on the&#13;
personality of Jim.&#13;
&#13;
Some of the early signs from the new administration do not please me very much. I would like&#13;
to se1e the new administration separate itself more and better from the United States government.&#13;
I hope that will happen over time. I thinlc it is a major mistake for the Bank's internal media to&#13;
cover the fact that Wolfowitz went and signed the book for King Fahd [Bin Abdul Aziz].&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: The Saudi Arabian king.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah. I really don't think it was a bad thing for him to do; I think it was bad for it to&#13;
get the type of internal coverage that it did.&#13;
&#13;
And the other thing is that this new group is playing very close to the vest what they want to&#13;
achieve with the institution and what changes they're going to bring about to make it happen.&#13;
This worries me because the current U~S. administration has brought about a lot of changes&#13;
through the budget. You know, they've strangled some units in. order to have them go out of&#13;
business, and they've thrown far too much money at other units, and this has led to, you know,&#13;
some real problems within the U.S. administration. I worry that these guys are going to try to&#13;
bring about change within the Bank through the budget because I think that would be very, very&#13;
harmful.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Now, when you say "these guys," you mean the United States administration?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: No. I'm talking about the new president and those surrounding him.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Oh, okay, uh-huh.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Already I've heard that there's a level of stridency between people in the president's&#13;
front office and some ofthe vice presidents. That's not--you know, it's not a constructive&#13;
departure from, you know, the progress that we've made.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Uh-huh, uh-huh. After you retired from the World Bank in 2000, you worked for a&#13;
time in the private sector. Now, you've touched on this, but just in a nutshell, how would you&#13;
compare your Bank experiences to those in the private sector? I can guess what you're going to&#13;
say from what you said before.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jamil Sopher&#13;
                     September 2 and 9 and November 18, 2005- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  123&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: All right. Well, I mean, you see, the problem is that that six month experience isn't&#13;
really the one I would generalize off of. What I would generalize off of is the fact that since&#13;
2002, I've returned to the Bank. You know, the Bank will only pay me for 190 days in a given&#13;
year, and, you know, I've come to understand and appreciate this is not my place anymore. I'm&#13;
there doing a job. People there like me and respond to me, but it's not my Bank. I'm not the one&#13;
who's going to get promoted; I'm not the one who's going to lay my mark on policy; I'm not the&#13;
one who succeeds or fails based on, you know, our client countries.&#13;
&#13;
So one of the things I've tried to do is to get other business. And I have other business at this&#13;
point, and that's where I can generalize on some of the differences. I have about three other&#13;
clients. One of them is a money management firm in Switzerland; the second is a rice processing&#13;
project company that~s trying to develop a project in Indonesia; and then the third is a computer&#13;
company on the West Coast.&#13;
&#13;
The asset management company in Geneva asked me if I would do work for them precisely&#13;
because of the background I have in emerging countries. They were very scared about picking&#13;
investments in emerging countries and                      know with the             I have, I&#13;
      be able to     them with that.&#13;
&#13;
                                                        I have been very successful in the work that&#13;
I have done with them, in large part because I've been willing to work. I've been willing to put in&#13;
long hours; I've been willing to do real analysis; I've been willing to write it up. And what I give&#13;
them is a finished product which, because it's finished and it's typed World Bank-style, they've&#13;
attributed a lot of credibility to.&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, there's a certain level to which you've got to think about things. One of the&#13;
assignments that they asked me to do was to find them a China fund where they can channel&#13;
investment for some of the accounts that they're managing. And I spent a fair bit of time, you&#13;
know, looking through a bunch of different China funds, and I finally found one that had a&#13;
strategy that I felt comfortable with. It was a strategy that said, you know, "Be involved in areas&#13;
of growth, but don't leave yourself vulnerable to the business cycle." What does that mean?&#13;
Well, one of the things it means is that ifthere's a lot of cars being sold in China, figure out how&#13;
to participate in that without investing directly in cars, because if there's a downturn in the&#13;
business cycle, the first thing people are going to stop buying is things as expensive as cars.&#13;
And, you know, one of the things that they figured out is you can participate in the automotive&#13;
industry by investing in toll roads rather than cars. You can invest in manufacturing by investing&#13;
in public utilities rather than the factory itself. When I heard this, this made a lot of sense to me,&#13;
and I recommended it, wrote it up very tightly. This group channeled some investment into that&#13;
fund. The fund has performed incredibly well, and I've come out looking like a genius when it&#13;
comes to picking China funds when it really wasn't that hard but, you know, there was work to&#13;
be done.&#13;
&#13;
The Indonesia rice project. What differentiated me from others for this group of investors that I&#13;
front is that I'm not scared of going into a place that's, you know, relatively barren if they're&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 124&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
doing the job right and, you know, the things that would be the standard risk issues are not risks&#13;
because they're well taken care of. Now, there's other Â·             know those are risks that&#13;
can be dealt with.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: So you think the Bank compares well with the private sector in terms of the quality&#13;
of the staff and the industriousness?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah. I mean, to me, the big difference is that, you know, with the private sector&#13;
you do a lot less churning than you do at the Bank. To me, what is crazy is the number of&#13;
meetings that we have at the Bank which involved 30 or 40 people and, you know, the number of&#13;
writing and           and           of documents. But in the                      have the&#13;
opposite problem.                                                                  At least that's&#13;
my experience.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What did you like best in your career in the Bank and what did you like least?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: The thing that was most satisfying to me was knowing that I was making an impact&#13;
on the lives of people who really needed it. That, you know--that would give me a shot of&#13;
energy day after day after day. I enjoyed a lot the Staff Association job, but I didn't enjoy it&#13;
nearly as much as making an impact on the lives of people in poor countries.&#13;
&#13;
What I liked least was the pettiness that overtook the institution between '87 and '97. There's still&#13;
a little bit of that around, but it's not nearly as debilitating.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: What would you consider to be your greatest success in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: I have difficulty saying one. I had three projects that meant a lot to me and then my&#13;
recent work in mainstreaming financial management. I spoke in an earlier interview about the&#13;
Tata project in India.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes, in India.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: That was to me one of the more amazing pieces of work that I've been involved in&#13;
because it literally changed the way a country did business.&#13;
&#13;
The energy sector study that I did in the Philippines in the early '90s was a major thing because&#13;
of the fact that, you know, we did very good analysis of the problems and ten years later I'm told&#13;
that the findings and recommendations are still very timely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  125&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The work that I did on an unsuccessful project with regard to the EDSA light rail transport&#13;
system in the Philippines was very, very satisfying.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: EDSA, is that ..&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: EDSA is ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: E-D-S-A is the acronym?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: That's the acronym for the boulevard, and it's something De Los Santos Avenue.&#13;
Not only did--you know, they did the project without Bank financing, but we made a major&#13;
impact on the policies and processes that were followed.&#13;
&#13;
And then, you know, what's happened in financial management, I really do believe that there's a&#13;
direct linkage between good financial management and improved transparency and improved&#13;
governance in a country. Yesterday, I saw an article from Guyana saying that four ofthe&#13;
reforms that I considered critical to improving the country when I did the CFAA [Country&#13;
Financial Accountability Assessment] there in January of '02 had been accepted and&#13;
implemented by the government. That's very satisfying.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes. And what would you have liked to have done better? Anything in particular?&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: I think I would have liked to have been a better Chairman of the Staff Association.&#13;
There was an opportunity there to improve the quality of life of my colleagues. I really think&#13;
that the reason that the Bank is so good is because of the quality of its people, and I didn't do as&#13;
good a job as I might have.&#13;
&#13;
Now, there's one other thing. I wish I had learned to play the bureaucratic system early in my&#13;
career better than I did because I think I could have done--I could have achieved a lot more if I,&#13;
you know, hadn't been in conflict as much as I was with decision-makers.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Although in your defense, I must say, from having been a close observer of the&#13;
Staff Association over the years, being Chairman is a tough job for anybody. It really is.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: And especially when you have a major reform going on ..&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
SOPHER: .. as was the case when--but, you know, I mean the thing is I had hopes that I could&#13;
have done it better. And to me those two things, the 2 percent increase and the introduction of&#13;
SAP, you know, really tainted that period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, we have about two minutes left on this tape. Any notable personalities that&#13;
you encountered in your Bank career that you'd like to especially cite? I mean, you've talked&#13;
about a number of them over the last few sessions.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Well, you know, I mean aside from Jim Wolfensohn, who I regard as a giant, and&#13;
Shengman Zhang, who I think is really a very decent and high-quality human being and a good&#13;
manager, the one person I haven't mentioned at all in these interviews is David Hopper, and yet I&#13;
think David Hopper really set a wonderful tone for me as I came into the Bank. He was the Vice&#13;
President of South Asia at the time, and at a time when, you know, there was a lot ofbickering&#13;
and in-fighting, you know, all around the Bank, David made the South Asia Region a very&#13;
pleasant place to work, showing respect for people while at the same time really doing the job of&#13;
settling disputes. I like David a lot.&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Thank you very much, Jamil, for participating in this series of interviews. I think&#13;
you've contributed a lot to this World Bank Oral History program.&#13;
&#13;
SOF'HER: Thank you, Chuck.&#13;

            In September and November 2005, Jamil
            Sopher was interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group
            Archives oral history program by Charles Ziegler. During his
            tenure at the Bank from 1979 to 2000, Mr. Sopher worked  in
            the  following areas: as a financial analyst in the energy
            and water supply division, South Asia projects department
            (1979-1982); as a financial analyst in the power and
            transportation division, South Asia projects department
            (1982-1983); as a senior financial analyst in the power and
            transportation division, South Asia projects department
            (1983-1985); as a senior financial analyst in the energy
            division, East Asia and Pacific projects department
            (1985-1987); as a senior financial analyst in the industry
            and energy operations division, Asia country department 2
            (1987-1991); as a senior financial analyst in the industry
            and energy operations division, East Asia and Pacific
            country department 1 (1991-1994); as a senior financial
            analyst in the infrastructure operations division, East Asia
            and Pacific country department 1 (1994-1995); as a principal
            financial analyst in the infrastructure operations division,
            East Asia and Pacific country department 1 (1995-1996); as a
            principal financial analyst in the Asia infrastructure unit,
            Asia technical department (1996-1997); as a principal
            financial analyst in the finance and PSD sector unit, East
            Asia and Pacific sector units (1997); as a chairman in the
            staff association (1998-2000); and as operations adviser in
            the quality assurance group (2000). His transcript mainly
            concerns his contribution to the staff association, his
            affinity towards James Wolfensohn, and the evolution of the
            Bank in the late 1970s from a research-oriented institution
            to a service-oriented development bank in the late 1980s and 1990s.
