The undersigned member of the Committee constituted under Section 7 of Article V of the&#13;
Articles of Agreement of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) hereby&#13;
submits this recommendation as part of the report pursuant to Section 4 (iii) of Article III of said Articles&#13;
in respect of the proposal that the Bank grants to the Arab Republic of Egypt a loan in an amount of&#13;
US$550,000,000. The purpose of said loan is to strengthen institutions and policies for increasing access&#13;
and improving rural sanitation services in the Governorates of Beheira, Dakahliya and Sharkiya in the&#13;
Arab Republic of Egypt.&#13;
1.     The undersigned member of the Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to&#13;
grant such a loan, and of the purpose to which the proceeds of the loan are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The undersigned member of the Committee is of the opinion that the program in support of which&#13;
the proceeds of such loan are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Bank as set forth in Article&#13;
I of said Articles of Agreement, and that said program is designed to promote the development of the&#13;
productive facilities and resources of the Arab Republic of Egypt and is in the interest of the Arab&#13;
Republic of Egypt and of the members of the Bank as a whole.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the undersigned member of the Committee finds that said program merits financial&#13;
assistance from the Bank, and hereby recommends said program for such assistance.&#13;
