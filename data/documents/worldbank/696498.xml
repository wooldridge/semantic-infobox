1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The Government of China (GOC) has requested World Bank assistance in&#13;
financing a national seed commercialization project. The project would help develop a&#13;
conducive environment for the development of a commercial seed sector through the&#13;
adoption cf necessary policies and an appropriate regulatory framework. It would&#13;
modernize, rationalize and commercialize a number of seed companies and strengthen the&#13;
public seed sector so that it can provide effective services to farmers. It would provide&#13;
support to several national and provincial seed organizations and would modernize seed&#13;
companies from 14 provinces. The project aims ultimately to facilitate the development&#13;
of a vibrant seed sector, which can not only provide increased amounts of quality seed to&#13;
farmers but also operate through efficient and self-sustaining commercial enterprises.&#13;
Incremental benefits would come from improved yield, lower sowing rates and reduced&#13;
seed costs for major crops such as hybrid rice, hybrid maize, wheat, soybeans, cotton,&#13;
vegetables and fruit trees. This in turn would increase farmer incomes and employment.&#13;
The project was identified by a Food and Agriculture Organization/Cooperative Program&#13;
(FAO/CP) mission and a World Bank team in November 1993 and prepared in May and&#13;
November 1994. It was preappraised and then appraised by World Bank missions in&#13;
April 1995 and September/October 1995.&#13;
B. AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
1.2   Agriculture continues to play a major role in the Chinese economy. It is estimated&#13;
that agriculture accoun s for 20 percent of GNP and provides employment for about 200&#13;
million farm families. Less than 15 percent of China's land area is arable, and farming&#13;
systems are generaily very intensive with heavy inputs of labor and fertilizer. Nearly half&#13;
the cropped area is irrigated. This intensive farming has enabled China to meet the great&#13;
bulk of its basic food requirements.&#13;
1.3   As a result of policy reforms in the late 1970s-in particular the introduction of&#13;
the household production responsibility system and the development of rural markets-&#13;
the value of agricultural output grew at an impressive average of 6 percent per year over&#13;
the period 1978-1990. The growth rate increased to over 7 percent during 1990-93 but&#13;
declined substantially to 2.4 percent in 1994. Grain production, which ranged between&#13;
376-402 million tons during 1985-1988, was the Government's central agricultural&#13;
concern during the late 1980s. Major efforts were made to increase grain production, and&#13;
by the 1990s production had risen to a new plateau of around 450 million tons (435456&#13;
million tons between 1990-94).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.4   In 1994, the Government was concerned about the decline in rice and wheat&#13;
output. The official estimates of paddy production were 189 million tons in 1990 but&#13;
only 176 millic.n tons in 1994. Likewise, wheat production fell from 106 million ton in&#13;
1993 to 99 million tons in 1994. This has resulted in an increase in wheat and rice&#13;
imports and a suspension in exports of rice and corn due to insufficient stocks. The&#13;
nationwide inflation in 1993-94 combined witH "lagging commodity price management"&#13;
placed farmers in a cost/price squeeze that discouraged fertilizer purchases and&#13;
contributed-along with the bad weather-to the drop in agriculture production and a&#13;
substantial decline in gross value of agricultural output in 1994.  Since then, the&#13;
government has improved its monetary policy to stabilize inflation and to maintain&#13;
suitable terms of trade for grain production with respect to input prices. Farmers were&#13;
able to farm more intensively with improved varieties of seeds, and output has increased.&#13;
Grain production was reported to reach another record high of 466 million tons in 1995.&#13;
C. BANK GROUP LENDING IN AGRICULTURE&#13;
1.5   Bank Group lending to China for agriculture is designed to support the&#13;
government's efforts to increase and diversify agricultural production. Specific policy&#13;
considerations include reforms designed to make government agencies more efficient and&#13;
commercialize enterprises and services. Bank Group lending to date has comprised 43&#13;
operations, amounting to more than $6.2 billion and has covered a wide spectrum of&#13;
geographic areas and subsectors, with major efforts in land development, irrigation and&#13;
drainage, flood control (11 projects), upgrading of agricultural support services including&#13;
agricultural research, extension, seed improvement (3 projects), development of&#13;
specialized subsectors including forestry, fruit and fisheries (9 projects), agroindustry,&#13;
credit, and logistics (8 projects), watershed rehabilitation and poverty alleviation (5&#13;
projects) and area development (7 projects). This lending has been designed to support&#13;
the govemmeni's efforts to increase and diversify agricultural production through more&#13;
efficient use of land, water, capital and labor and through the improvement of support&#13;
services such as credit, research, extension and veterinary services.&#13;
1.6   Since 1987, the Bank Group has supported a series of provincial development&#13;
projects in which an area development approach has been applied. The projects were&#13;
designed to alleviate poverty and to assist the Government in its ongoing reform process.&#13;
The Rural Seclor Adjustment Loan (Cr. 1932-CHA and Ln. 2967-CHA), which was&#13;
approved during 1988, contributed to the articulation of the overall reform process, and&#13;
involved the Bank Group in increasingly intensive policy dialogue in agriculture and&#13;
poverty allevialion, sustained through the process of project development and several&#13;
major sector stLdies (e.g., on grain, poverty alleviation, animal feed, the management of&#13;
the Yellow River and marketing of agricultural crops) and project formulation exercises.&#13;
1.7   Implementation of most ongoing Bank Group-financed projects in the agriculture&#13;
sector is on schedule. Experience in previous Bank Group agricultural projects in China&#13;
is that physical works have been completed on time or ahead of schedule. Disbursements&#13;
for agricultural projects, in fact, usually outpace those in other sectors. Notable features&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
of all the projects are the high standard of project management, the active participation of&#13;
farmers and the effective collaboration of government authorities at all levels. Sixteen&#13;
projects have been completed. The completion reports for these projects indicate that&#13;
implementation was generally successful, that most economic rates of return reached or&#13;
exceeded appraisal estimates, and that the technology used was sound and appropriate for&#13;
wider application.&#13;
1.8   The Bank Group's current lending strategy in agriculture, while maintaining&#13;
subsectoral development and poverty alleviation objectives, is putting greater emphasis&#13;
on commercial development. The new projects under preparation such as the Animal&#13;
Feed Project, the State Farms Commercialization Project and this project, all aim at&#13;
strengthening the commercial orientation of these subsectors and enabling future private-&#13;
sector participation.&#13;
D. SEED SUBSECTOR&#13;
1.9   Advances in seed technology are one of the most important channels for&#13;
improving productivity in agriculture. The government recognizes the crucial role of the&#13;
seed industry in achieving national targets of grain production and agriculture production&#13;
goals generally. For this reason, it sees as a major constraint the present structure of the&#13;
seed sector, which allows low-productivity, low-quality, unresponsive, loss-making seed&#13;
producers to persist. There is full recognition of the need for major steps in the direction&#13;
of commercialization, if only to stop the drain on the budget from the need to cover seed&#13;
company losses. Central government strategies, while ensuring seed supply to farmers,&#13;
will also promote efficient seed commercialization. At the macro level, the Government&#13;
aims to create a conducive environment to support the seed commercial development by&#13;
drafting policy and regulatory reforms. Its policies are designed to promote seed-sector&#13;
commercialization by shifting from an administrative hierarchy of seed companies&#13;
(provincial, prefecture and county) to a competitive structure and by supporting efficient&#13;
companies. At the enterprise level, it emphasizes high-quality and new-variety seeds,&#13;
modernization of seed processing and packaging equipment and seed enterprise&#13;
profitability. The success of commercialization strategies will be influenced by overall&#13;
economic reform in China. In particular, it will be influenced by the overall reform&#13;
program for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), since the sector is now dominated by&#13;
jurisdictional seed companies and state farms.&#13;
1.10 The formal seed sector in China is large and complex. In 1993 there were more&#13;
than 2,700 seed companies in China, one for almost every administrative division within&#13;
the country. The companies are loosely networked in a pyramidal structure with the&#13;
China National Seed Corporation (CNSC) at the apex. Beneath the CNSC, each of the 30&#13;
provinces has a provincial seed company, and below these are some 500 prefecture and&#13;
2,200 county seed companies. All the seed companies are state-owned enterprises known&#13;
as executive/business management units. In addition there are 2,500 Township Seed&#13;
Supply Stations (TSSS) owned by farmer collectives, whose main function is to distribute&#13;
seeds to farmers. They are also responsible for organizing the production and local sale&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
of conventional (i.e., nonhybrid) seed of crops such as rice and wheat by farmer&#13;
cooperatives.&#13;
1.11   The uset of seed produced by the organized sector has increased from about 1.3&#13;
million tons in 1976 to over 3.5 million tons in 1994. This is about 25 percent of the total&#13;
annual seed requirement of about 12.5 million tons. The balance is met by the informal&#13;
seed sector, i.e. by farmers' own seed or farmer-to-farmer sales. Given that conventional&#13;
crops, such as wheat and self-pollinated rice, make up the bulk of crop production and&#13;
that much of the area under these crops does not need new seed every year, the ratio of&#13;
processed to farmer seed is reasonable. It is officially projected that in the year 2000 the&#13;
total demand For seed will be 12.0 million tons (the reduction being due to reduced&#13;
seeding rates and a reduction in the total sown area) and that the organized sector will&#13;
supply about 44 percent of this demand.&#13;
1.12  In addition to the seed companies, a large number of state farms (SFs) and a few&#13;
collective seed companies are also involved in the production of seed. While most SF&#13;
seed production is for own use, a nunber of farms specialize in industrial crop seed&#13;
production (e.g., sugar beet, cotton or oilseed rape) for sale to other state farms. At&#13;
present there are a veiy limrited number of private seed companies due both to the general&#13;
difficulty in establishing private sector enterprises and also to specific regulatory&#13;
requirements in the seed sector.&#13;
1.13   1 he organization of agricultural seed activities in China can be summarized as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)    Selection and Breeding: The selection and breeding of varieties is mainly&#13;
done at agricultural research and educational institutions such as agricultural&#13;
science academies and agricultural universities. Some seed companies are&#13;
increasingly giving emphasis to selecting and breeding their own varieties.&#13;
There are no restrictions in this area, and individuals and collective entities&#13;
are also encouraged to carry out breeding.&#13;
(b)    Adaptation and Regional Trials:  Trials are jointly organized by the&#13;
national and provincial agricultural research institutions and seed&#13;
administration stations in the provinces. Any new promising line has to&#13;
un-crgo tv. o to three years regional adaptability trials and one to two years&#13;
field production trials for consideration for registration and approval for&#13;
release.&#13;
(c)    Variety Examination:  Evaluation of trial results is done at national,&#13;
provincial or prefectural/municipality level by the respective crop variety&#13;
examination committees, which comprise members from local governments,&#13;
seed administrations, and research and academic institutions. A promising&#13;
candidate line, which possesses definite quality advantages over existing&#13;
varieties, will be awarded a variety certificate, registered and announced by&#13;
the agricultural department at the corresponding administrative level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
(d)   Seed Production: Seed production is mainly managed by county seed&#13;
companies and state fanns and is done in their own seed production bases.&#13;
Early generations are produced in state stock seed farms. Hybrids of&#13;
important crops are only produced by government designated companies.&#13;
Townships and individuals also produce seed in their seed production bases&#13;
mainly for use in their own administrative areas.&#13;
(e)   Seed Marketing and Distribution: Seed companies are still the main&#13;
marketing channels in China, and hybrids of important crops are marketed&#13;
only by the designated companies that produce them. Conventional seed&#13;
and vegetable seed are marketed through different channels, and collectives&#13;
and individuals are allowed to trade in these seeds. The basic requirement&#13;
for marketing seed is to obtain a seed business operation permit from the&#13;
local seed station and the permit in turn is used to obtain a business&#13;
operation license issued by the local Industrial and Commercial&#13;
Administration office. Since 1992, the Ministry of Agriculture, through&#13;
regulations on producing and marketing crop seed and animal vaccines by&#13;
agricultural, scientific, research and educational units, has pemitted research&#13;
and educational institutions to produce and market all kinds of crop seed.&#13;
(f)   Seed Quality Inspection and Quarantine:  Seed quality inspection is&#13;
enforced by the Department of Agriculture seed administration stations at&#13;
the county level and above. Quarantine inspection is done by the&#13;
Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine Services at its 280 border&#13;
and port/airport district and subdistrict stations in all the provinces and&#13;
autonomous regions.&#13;
Seed Industry Structure&#13;
1.14  Seed companies are primarily responsible to government agencies at their&#13;
administrative levels. Thus the China National Seed Corporation is responsible to the&#13;
Department of Agriculture (DOA) of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Provincial Seed&#13;
Companies (PSCs) are responsible to the provincial Departments of Agriculture, and&#13;
similarly at prefecture, municipal and county levels.&#13;
1.15 The lines of command and responsibility for the state farms vary somewhat from&#13;
province to province, but at the national level, the Bureau of State Farms within MOA&#13;
has overall responsibility. An organogram indicating the organizational structure of the&#13;
seed industry and its position within MOA is provided in Figure 1.&#13;
Regulatory Agencies And Institutions&#13;
1.16 MOA has four main agencies concemed directly with seed regulations and policy,&#13;
as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
(a)   DOA Seed Division (SD): This unit is responsible for drafting seed laws,&#13;
regulations, plans and policies and for supervising seed management.&#13;
(h)   National Agricultural Technical Extension Service Center (NATESC):&#13;
The National Seed Administration Station and the Plant Protection Station&#13;
became part of a new National Agricultural Technical Extension Service&#13;
Center (NATESC). Seed activities are grouped into three divisions within&#13;
the center-the Seed Industry Management Division, the Seed Testing&#13;
Division (which contains the National Seed Testing Center) and the Variety&#13;
Trial and Seed Multiplication Division. These Divisions are responsible for&#13;
the implementation of seed extension and national seed security, application&#13;
of new technologies and methods of seed production and seed processing,&#13;
control and regulation of the seed industry and seed quality, and vocational&#13;
training. The provincial, prefectural and county seed administration stations,&#13;
however, have not been reorganized as part of their respective extension&#13;
services.&#13;
(c)   National Crop Variety Examination and Approval Committee Office&#13;
(NCVEACO):  This unit is responsible for coordinating, supervising,&#13;
examining and registering new varieties at the national level. Registration of&#13;
new crop varieties at the provincial level is carried out by the provincial&#13;
CVEACO.&#13;
(d)   Adwinistration of Animal and Plant Quarantine Services (AAPQS):&#13;
This is anothler MOA executing unit that is responsible for quarantine in the&#13;
international exchange of plants and animals.&#13;
1.17  Ir. addition, the National Patent Office through the patent law is responsible for&#13;
the prot'ction of new plant varieties by pa.enting their breeding methodologies.&#13;
Apvlications for patent are coordinated by the Patent Division of the MOA Department of&#13;
Science, Technology and Quality Standardization in Beijing.&#13;
Seed Companies&#13;
1.18 China National Seed Corporation (CNSC). CNSC was incorporated into MOA&#13;
in 1982 with responsibility for planning, coordinating and distributing domestic seed&#13;
production and the import and export of all seed. CNSC is an integrated company,&#13;
involved in research, production and trade with more than 40 subsidiaries and joint&#13;
ventures. The main seeds produced by these in eight provinces are: vegetables (200 tons&#13;
in 1993), melon, hybrid maize (150,000 tons) and rice (2,000 tons), cotton, jute, oilseeds,&#13;
herbs and flowers. It owns 46 retail outlets in China and has trading arrangements with&#13;
more than 80 clients in 40 countries worldwide. In 1992, under the market reform&#13;
program, CNSC became an autonomous seed trading company. It no longer has&#13;
responsibility for administrative planning of domestic seed production, nor does it have a&#13;
monopoly on exports and imports. It remains involved in seed policy-making at the&#13;
national level and in the coordination of the seed trade among the provinces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.19  Provincial Seed Companies (PSCs). In general the PSCs are responsible for&#13;
preparing annual provincial seed development prograns and plans, which provide&#13;
guidance for lower-level seed companies. Until recently they were also exclusively able&#13;
to undertake interprovincial trade in seeds. The PSCs concentrate on the multiplication&#13;
of breeder seed obtained from research academies or universities. Breeding material,&#13;
previously supplied free, is now paid for either by outright purchase or by the payment of&#13;
royalties. Some PSCs have established joint ventures with overseas companies to&#13;
produce special high-value seeds, usually horticultural crops for export.&#13;
1.20 Prefectural/Municipal Seed Companies (MSCs). The main responsibility of&#13;
the MSCs is to produce foundation seed from the breeder seed supplied by the PSCs.&#13;
Most MSCs also produce breeder seed, production or certified seed, and many specialize&#13;
in producing seed of particular crops. Seed is produced on production bases selected and&#13;
supervised by the MSCs. A considerable number of MSCs have processing plants to&#13;
clean, grade and pack seeds.&#13;
1.21   County Seed Companies (CSCs). These are the backbone of the Chinese seed&#13;
industry, being responsible for the production of certified seed from foundation seed&#13;
supplied by the MSCs. Commercial seed is actually produced by farmers under contract&#13;
to Village Committees, which are usually organized into production bases by&#13;
agrotechnical extension stations (ATES). Contracts detail the price to be paid for the&#13;
seed, the quantity to be supplied, the procurement time and penalties for failure to meet&#13;
requirements. CSCs are responsible for ensuring the supply of inputs (foundation seed,&#13;
maternal and paternal parent seed for hybrids, fertilizer and pesticides). Inputs are&#13;
generally supplied on credit, but at full cost. However in some cases such as fertilizer for&#13;
hybrid rice seed, the price is subsidized. The CSCs provide technical advice to growers&#13;
and are responsible for monitoring the seed crop for certification purposes. CSCs&#13;
undertake seed processing and testing according to the standards and quality of their&#13;
facilities.&#13;
1.22  State Farm Seed Companies. State farm seed companies are usually subfarms&#13;
or teams within the administration of state farms, most lacking independent financial&#13;
accounts. Normally, these seed producers have no official relationship with seed&#13;
companies under the agiicultural system. However, they also sell their surplus seed in&#13;
nearby farm markets. Specialty seed may be supplied to a much wider area.&#13;
1.23  Informal Seed Sector. It is reported that about 20-25 percent of the seeds&#13;
produced in China for self-pollinating crops of conventional varieties are obtained from&#13;
seed companies/extension stations while the rest (75-80 percent) are seeds saved by&#13;
farmers for planting the next crop. Except for local specialty crops, there appears to be&#13;
virtually no direct marketing of seeds by farmers-production is either strictly for own&#13;
use or umder contractuai arrangements with the seed companies.&#13;
1.24  Private Seed Sector. Private seed companies do not really exist at present. A&#13;
few county seed companies and research institutes have spun off snall subsidiaries that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
produce seed of high value crops such as hybrid grain seeds, vegetables and horticulture&#13;
crops and have an ownership structure that includes some private parties, mostly through&#13;
worker sharehiolding. Almost all have other activities in addition to producing and&#13;
marketing seeds, and most are profitable. The number and size of these companies will&#13;
probably increase in the future due to continuing increase in the demand for vegetables&#13;
and thus vegetable seeds. The area under vegetable production is now estimated at 4.5&#13;
million ha or 3 percent of the area under crops, requiring about 1.2 million tons of&#13;
vegetable seed each year.&#13;
E. SEED TECHNOLOGY AND PERFORMANCE&#13;
1.25   Rice.  In the 1970s, the Chinese Government searched for solutions to the&#13;
prevailing food grain shortages that had resulted from increasing population and stagnant&#13;
grain yield. Rice, wheat and corn were chosen for research and development due to their&#13;
potential for increased yields. The first hybrid rice was identified in 1974, and by 1975,&#13;
hybrid rice was ready to be released for commercial production. The parent lines were&#13;
from the best selected local varieties and imported ones from the International Rice&#13;
Research Institute (IRRI) and Thailand. Initially, the average seed yield of hybrid rice&#13;
seed farms was low (0.4 tiha) but by 1991 the average yield of seed was 2.25 t/ha. In&#13;
some areas, it has reached 4-5 t/ha.' The great improvement in hybrid rice seed&#13;
production was due to the development of efficient seed production methods, improved&#13;
parent lines and a good production system. The Government has used its information&#13;
systems to create awareness of the existence and benefits of hybrid seed among farmers.&#13;
Responsibility was assigned to one or more officials at each level to monitor the progress&#13;
of adoption of hybrid rice, which was promoted by training and extension.&#13;
Demonstration plots were emphasized.&#13;
1.26  The farm yield of hybrid rice increased from 4.2 t/ha in 1976 to 5.5 t/ha in 1991.&#13;
The area under hybrid rice increased from 0.1 million ha in 1976 to 15.4 million ha in&#13;
1991, representing 45 percent of the total rice production area. The government plans to&#13;
increase the area under hybrid rice by another 10 percent by the year 2000 and to increase&#13;
the farm yield to 6-7.5 tlha. To achieve this high yield, China will need new germplasm&#13;
from international sources.&#13;
1.27 Wheat is the second major grain crop after rice, occupying about 29 million ha&#13;
per year with a total output of 99 million tons in 1994. Spring wheat, accounting for 17&#13;
percent of the total area, is planted in March-April and harvested in July and is largely a&#13;
single crop. ][t is grown in the north of China in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner&#13;
Mongolia, Gansu, Xinjiang and other provinces. Winter wheat, accounting for 83 percent&#13;
of the sown wheat area, is planted in late September and harvested in mid-June.&#13;
Average seed yields are always lower than the grain yields of farns using that seed, inter alia, due to the need to&#13;
reject much unpure seed production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
Depending on the availability of irrigation water, double cropping of wheat followed by&#13;
com, millet, beans and other cash crops is practiced. Production of winter wheat is&#13;
concentrated in 5 zones: North China, Upper Yellow River, Yangtze River, Southwest,&#13;
and South Chine.&#13;
1.28  Wheat yields increased moderately, from 2.8 t/ha in 1984 to 3.4 t/ha in 1994,&#13;
because of improved varieties of seed, which are early maturing and have better&#13;
resistance to disease, drought and cold. For example, cold resistant varieties (Fengkang&#13;
and CA837) have marginally improved yields in the northern region (21 percent over the&#13;
last 10-year period). But the development of still better varieties through research and&#13;
development should be a priority because wheat imports have been increasing due to&#13;
increases in domestic demand and lagging production.&#13;
1.29 Corn is the third main grain of China, after rice and wheat. In 1994, the corn&#13;
sown area was 21 million hectares (18.7 percent of the country's grain sown area), and&#13;
total corn production was 99 million tons, accounting for 22.3 percent of the country's&#13;
total grain production of 445 million tons. Most of the production is located in the north&#13;
and northeast regions, which has 70 percent of the sown area and 85 percent of total&#13;
production. The country's average corn yield is 4.7 t/ha, 15 percent higher than the&#13;
average grain yield of 4.1 t/ha&#13;
1.30 The increase in China's corn production has mainly been due to improved hybrid&#13;
varieties, such as Dan Yu and Yie Tan, which have "compact" seed. The development of&#13;
hybrid corn began in the 1950s. Double cross was introduced in the 1960s and single&#13;
cross in the 1970s. The development and popularization of compact hybrid corn seed&#13;
alone resulted in a yield increment of 1.5 t/ha. In 1965, hybrid com accounted for about&#13;
10 percent of the com sown area, and the average yield was 1 tlha. The area sown to&#13;
hybrid corn progressively expanded to 79 percent by 1975 and 90 percent by 1994, and&#13;
the corn yield increased to 3.6 t/ha in 1975 and 4.7 ttha in 1994. The average yield&#13;
differs significantly by region, ranging from 5.3 t/ha in the northem region (Jilin,&#13;
Liaoning and Heilongjiang) to 3 t/ha in the southem region (Sichuan, Yunnan and&#13;
Guizhou). Corn breeders believe that average yields could be increased to 6.5 t/ha, if&#13;
they could get arctcss to improved breeding materials. The aim is to produce seeds with&#13;
high but stable yield and disease and pest tolerance. Better water supplies and inputs&#13;
would aiso contribute to increased production.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

2. SEED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT&#13;
A. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND&#13;
2.1   After the establishment of the People's Republic, food production was the&#13;
principal concern of the Chinese Government and seed development was given priority.&#13;
In 1949 the Government established a Seed Division within the Ministry of Food to plan&#13;
and manage tho supply of seed in the country. The separate Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
(MOA) was given the responsibility for variety evaluation and recommendation, and the&#13;
results were transferred to the Food Ministry for implementation. In 1958, due to the lack&#13;
of seed technicians in the Food Ministry, all responsibilities for seed, encompassing&#13;
administrative, techlical and business functions, were transferred to MOA.&#13;
2.2  In 1978, the China National Seed Corporation (CNSC) was set up to plan,&#13;
coordinate and distribute domestic seed and handle overseas dealings. It was also known&#13;
as the National Seed Bureau. Seed stations, which had the combined responsibilities of&#13;
seed administrations and seed companies, were also set up. In 1980, the State Council&#13;
issued a decree to separate the administrative functions of the CNSC from its business&#13;
activities. The separation was achieved in 1982, resulting in the establishment of the&#13;
MOA Seed Division (SD) and the National Seed Administration Station (NSAS). In&#13;
1991 the National Crop Variety Examination and Approval Committee Office&#13;
(NCVEACO) was formed to be responsible for new variety evaluation.&#13;
2.3   The development of the Chinese seed industry can be broadly divided into three&#13;
phases: (a) the period 1950-1977 when all seed sector activities were service oriented&#13;
and profit was not to be mentioned; (b) the period 1978-1989, when seed companies were&#13;
established, allowed to make minimal profits, and encouraged to produce seeds in which&#13;
they had a cornparative advantage; and (c) the period 1990-present, which marks the&#13;
beginning of seed market liberalization. Seed market liberalization started with removal&#13;
of CNSC monopoly power, the freeing up of the market for vegetable seed, the relaxation&#13;
of seed prices and the toleration of seed trade across political boundaries and&#13;
intemationally.&#13;
B. CONSTRAINTS&#13;
2.4   Policy, :regulatory, technical and financial factors present major inhibitions to the&#13;
growth in the seed sector, as follows.&#13;
Policy and Regulatory Constraints&#13;
2.5   The Secd Administration Regulations of May 1989 contain administrative policy&#13;
guidelines forrmulated to strengthen the development of seed activities by insuring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
..ppropriate seed quality standards and safeguarding the rights and interests of seed&#13;
breeders, distributors and users in a centrally planned economy. The regulations contain&#13;
policies on germplasm management, plant variety registration, strategic seed reserve&#13;
management and quarantine. Government considers they are inadequate for supporting&#13;
the new policy to develop a commercial seed sector. In particular, they do not deal with&#13;
issues of domestic trade across political boundaries, truth in labeling, distribution, breeder&#13;
rights, farmers rights, liability and compensation, and research institutions.&#13;
2.6   Plant Breeder Rights. At present, China has no legislation to protect intellectual&#13;
property rights in plant cultivars. Without such protection, it is currently very difficult&#13;
for breeders to sustain themselves financially in the current climate of diminishing&#13;
government subsidies for new cultivar development. The 1992 patent law provides some&#13;
measure of protection for hybrid seed. This law protects the breeding methods and&#13;
techniques used to produce new cultivars, but not the cultivars thernselves. In the case of&#13;
hybrid seed, users must return to the seed supplier for each growing season, and where&#13;
the availability of parent lines is tightly controlled, the patentability of the breeding&#13;
process affords protection to the cultivar. For open pollinated species such as wheat,&#13;
however, it is generally not possible for the breeder to gain adequate financial&#13;
remuneration after the initial release of seed, since farmers may produce seed for their&#13;
own use without consideration of ownership.&#13;
2.7   The lack of plant cultivar protection has discouraged foreign breeders from&#13;
introducing new germplasm from outside China. It is impossible to quantify the lost&#13;
opportunity represented by lack of access to the latest germplasm, but it has been&#13;
estimated by scientists ftom a multinational seed company that yields of strategically&#13;
important crops such as corn could be increased by as much as 15 percent if new&#13;
germplasm is introduced from outside China.&#13;
2.8   Seed Testing. The testing of seed for the physical attributes of germination,&#13;
purity and moisture content is a pivotal procedure in the management of seed quality.&#13;
MOA has acknowledged the requirement for seed testing within its regulatory framework&#13;
through promulgation of national seed standards and the establishment of a national seed&#13;
testing laboratory and associated laboratories at provincial and lower levels. In practice,&#13;
however, most of the seed laboratories are inadequately equipped and staff poorly trained.&#13;
The rules and procedures utilized by laboratories are outdated and do not reflect modem&#13;
knowledge in the area of seed science. The Bank-assisted Agricultural Support Services&#13;
Project (ASSP, Cr. 2462-CHA) (para. 2.31) is currently addressing some of these&#13;
deficiencies, and the present project would do considerably more.&#13;
2.9   Since 1991, China has been a member of the International Seed Testing&#13;
Association (ISTA), the primary international organization concerned with the&#13;
development and promulgation of seed testing methods. China's membership has been&#13;
through the Bureau of Animal Husbandry with the Forage Seed Laboratory of Beijing&#13;
Agricultural University being the sole accredited member laboratory. The National Seed&#13;
Testing Laboratory is currently not a member of ISTA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
2.10   Seed Certification. Most countries have developed programs for the certification&#13;
of the genetic integrity of plant cultivars within their seed regulatory framework. These&#13;
programs associated with the production of seed, essentially maintain an evidentiary trail&#13;
on the seed of cultivars as it is multiplied through successive generations. They are an&#13;
assurance to seed users that the cultivar stated on a label is true to type. At present China&#13;
does not have a reguilated seed certification scheme, as cultivar assurance has been the&#13;
responsibility of government operated seed companies, and this process has operated&#13;
satisfactorily. As the seed industry becomes more deregulated in the future, particularly&#13;
if seed companies cease to be state-owned enterprises, it may be necessary to have a&#13;
v oluntary seed certification scheme available in the public interest. However, this is not&#13;
Seen as an immediate necessity.&#13;
2.11   Most, if not all seed exported from China at present is of vegetable species, for&#13;
which seed certification is not required internationally. Should seed of other species, e.g.,&#13;
corn, be exported, China may need to conform to the OECD Seed Scheme for the&#13;
certification of seed in international trade, since importing countries usually require&#13;
internationally acceptable certification procedures. While possibly useful in the future,&#13;
the development of seed certification programs for either internal or external markets is&#13;
not seen as a current constraint on the development of the seed sector.&#13;
2.12 Crop V7ariety Examination, Evaluation, Approval and Registration. China&#13;
has had a formal system for the examination, evaluation, release and registration of crop&#13;
varieties for more than 30 years, now under the authority of Articles 12 and 13 of the&#13;
1989 Seed Regulations. All crop varieties developed in China or imported have to be&#13;
examined, evaluated, approved and registered before the seeds or vegetative propagules&#13;
can be multiplied and marketed to farmers. This system has the hierarchical structure of&#13;
most institutionls in the agricultural sector: NCVEACO coordinates and supervises the&#13;
examination and approval of new crop varieties at the national level with assistance of 14&#13;
professional crop-group subcommittees and the Provincial Crop Variety Evaluation and&#13;
Approval Corrumittees have responsibility for the examination and approval of crop&#13;
varieties at the provincial level also typically with the assistance of 14 provincial expert&#13;
subcommittees.&#13;
2.13   Under this two-tier examination, evaluation and approval system, the application&#13;
for release and approval of a new crop variety is usually made at the provincial level with&#13;
testing/examination in provincial trials for one year before it is entered into national&#13;
trials. A minimum of two years in provincial regional trials (PRT) for distinctness,&#13;
uniformity and stability and two years in provincial field production trials (PFPT) for&#13;
crop value and p:oductivity are generally required before a decision is made on provincial&#13;
relea:e ind the same for national approval, i.e., two years national regional trials (NRT)&#13;
and two years national field production trials (NFPT). Since the PFPT and the NRT&#13;
ornmence after the first PRT, the time to approval and registration of new and/or&#13;
imported crop varieties is three to four years at the provincial level and four to six years&#13;
at the national level. Varieties approved and registered for national usage carry a GS&#13;
prefix. Variety names are assigned by the NCVEACO.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.14  Although they are very formal and very conservative, the crop variety&#13;
examination, evaluation and registration system and requirements have not been viewed&#13;
as a significant constraint on either crop productivity or seed industry development until&#13;
rather recently. The present view, however, is that with increasing emphasis on the&#13;
adoption of advanced technologies to increase crop productivity coinciding with the&#13;
commercialization of the seed industry, the present system will now be a significant&#13;
impediment to increased agricultural productivity unless it is substantially reformed and&#13;
liberalized. An example cited is an important and much needed IRRI rice variety that&#13;
took four years for registration. Reforms especially needed include shortening of the&#13;
period for approval and registration, relaxation of cropping area restrictions and&#13;
permission for breeders to name varieties. Additionally, NCVEACO is ill-equipped to&#13;
carry out its assigned role. Among other things, it needs: (a) a modem computerized&#13;
information system to record, analyze and store the voluminous data on provincially and&#13;
nationally registered varieties, so that crop variety catalogs and databases can be&#13;
efficiently assembled, and (b) an adequate temperature- and humidity-controlled seed&#13;
store to maintain samples of seeds under trial prior to their being stored in perpetuity with&#13;
the National Institute of Germplasm Resources.&#13;
2.15   Prices and Trade. Until 1992, procurement and selling prices of improved seeds&#13;
were decided by provincial seed corporations within a price range suggested by the&#13;
provincial DOA and the provincial price bureau, which in turn was based on prices&#13;
established for commodiity grains. In principle, the seed prices were set at 10-15 percent&#13;
more than the prevailing free market grain price. Thus, seed prices did not reflect the&#13;
costs actually involved in producing and marketing seeds. A second level of controls&#13;
affecting seed prices comes from government limitation of the profits that state&#13;
enterprises can make from seed operations. Since 1992, there has been considerable&#13;
liberalization of seed prices. In many cases seed prices are now determined by the&#13;
market. For instance, hybrid corn seed is usually now about three times the commercial&#13;
corn price, and hybrid rice six times. However, in some provinces the prices of these&#13;
seeds are still constrained to be only 10-15 percent above the commercial price.&#13;
2.16   Until recently trade was limited to within a seed company's jurisdiction, typically&#13;
a county, but in the case of a provincial seed company, the province. Interprovincial and&#13;
even inter-county trade was small and occurred mostly under specific government&#13;
instructions. Official regulations also restricted trading and marketing of seed to seed&#13;
companies. It llow appears that there are no longer any enforced controls on trade&#13;
between provinces. 1Nevertheless, a number of restrictions remain, except in times of&#13;
shortage: (a) only designated companies, invariably state or provincial companies, can&#13;
distribute hybrid seeds for the rmain crops, (b) most provinces insist that seed produced in&#13;
anc-her province is sold only through the importing province's provincial seed company,&#13;
(c) interprovincial imports are frequently subject to a levy of up to 10 percent ad valorem,&#13;
(d) there are a large number of permits required to establish a seed company, and&#13;
(e) the present system of certification and seed control discourages competition. Freedom&#13;
to enter or exit the market, or a sector of a market, is essential, if farmers are to be given&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
the choice of ivhere to purchase their seeds. This is being addressed under the new seed&#13;
law (para. 2.22).&#13;
2.17   State-0)v ;aed Enterprises.  A major constraint for the development of a&#13;
comr.e_ciaii.cd seed sector is the fact that all seed producers are state owned enterprises&#13;
(SOEs) with all the ramifications that this entails. SOEs typically receive their orders&#13;
From the state system and, as government services, do not compete with each other. The&#13;
seed companies are now in an ambiguous situation. On the one hand, they are expected&#13;
to continue to play a social role by providing farmers with quality seed at set, minimum&#13;
prices; on the other, they are now expected to become commercial. In general, they are&#13;
still more concerned with the volume of output to meet state requirements than with&#13;
profit generation and sustainable investment. As a further aspect of their status as SOEs,&#13;
they remain obliged to provide housing, health, education and pension services for staffs&#13;
that are usually much larger than actual labor need.&#13;
Technical Cornstraints&#13;
2.18   There are two major technical constraints for the development of a modern&#13;
commercialized seed industry. Once recognized, they can only be addressed by major&#13;
investment. The first technical constraint is the lack of sufficiently developed seed&#13;
production bases. Quality seed production has to be done in seed production bases to&#13;
achieve proper isolation, uniform crop management and efficient operation.&#13;
Unfortunately, because farms in China are small (averaging 0.1 ha/capita), organizing&#13;
efficient production bases composed of individual farmers is difficult.  Thus, seed&#13;
companies desiring to enter the market for quality seed will typically plan to develop&#13;
production bases on tracts that they manage. In this regard, state farms, with readily&#13;
available plots, will have an advantage. In all cases, the development of quality&#13;
production bases will require significant investment and upgraded production technology.&#13;
2.19  The lack of seed testing laboratoiies equipped with full-time seed testing&#13;
personnel and seed testing equipment is another major technical constraint to improved&#13;
seed quality. A shortage of modern, efficient processing equipment and facilities and a&#13;
sLonage of manpower trained in modern seed production regulation and control&#13;
procedures is a second major technical constraint to seed quality.  Together these&#13;
deficiencies make it very difficult for most seed companies to produce and market seed of&#13;
good physical and genetic quality. The experience of companies that have been re-&#13;
equipped with modem facilities demonstrates the benefits to be obtained from the use of&#13;
efficient processing facilities (threshers, driers, cleaners, graders, delinters, chemical&#13;
applicators, and packaging equipment etc.). A prerequisite for the modernization of the&#13;
industry is therefore a major program of investment in new machinery and the related&#13;
training of opeirating staff.&#13;
Finarcial Constraints&#13;
2.20  Most seed enterprises appear to be affected by a shortage of working capital for&#13;
the operation of production bases (i.e. annual purchase of inputs for supply to farmer-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
p.-oducers) and for the purchase of raw seed. An analysis of the typical cost structure of a&#13;
provincial seed companay in 1994 indicates that during peak periods purchasing of raw&#13;
seed represents some 80 percent of the capital requirements of a seed company.&#13;
2.21   Most enterprises also appear to find it difficult to raise adequate amounts of&#13;
investment capital for the purchase of new equipment, especially for foreign exchange for&#13;
imported machinery, and for the improvement of production bases (e.g., irrigation and&#13;
drainage facilities, and access roads). At the most basic level, the firms' financial&#13;
difficulties are a reflection of the limited ability they have to generate and retain surplus&#13;
revenue over and above immediate financial needs. The margin between the sale price of&#13;
processed seed and the procurement price paid to farmers is insufficient to cover&#13;
processing costs in fill, let alone generate sufficient profit to finance reinvestment.&#13;
Analysis of seed company proposals submitted for inclusion under this project indicated&#13;
that only about one third were viable on the basis of 1994 selling prices. The long term&#13;
viability of a commercial seed industry will depend on improved access to short and long&#13;
termn capital, rationalization of the industry leading to fewer but more competitive&#13;
enterprises, and fiL-'her liberalization of prices (para. 2.15) to allow adequate profit&#13;
mar gin-.&#13;
C. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
Poliky and Regulatory Framework&#13;
2.22   Seed Policy. China's overall seed policy aims to increase the use of improved&#13;
agricuitLiral and horticultural seeds in order to increase the country's food and fiber&#13;
production. Policks to promote seed-sector commercialization include shifting from an&#13;
administrative hierarchy of seed companies (provincial, prefecture and county) to a&#13;
competitive structure and to support efficient companies.&#13;
2.23   To achieve this goal the following seed sectoral objectives are under consideration&#13;
by the government for the year 2000:&#13;
(a)    Law drafting. To prepare and enact "the Seed Law of China" and "New&#13;
Plant Variety Protection Regulations" and detailed implementing particulars,&#13;
including participation in the Intemational Union for the Protection of New&#13;
Varieties of Plants (UPOV) Convention;&#13;
(b)   Separation of the administrative and business functions of existing&#13;
administrative seed companies. To create an independent official seed&#13;
administration and monitoring system to regulate the seed industry and to&#13;
promote the establishment of modem seed corporations;&#13;
(z)    Replacement of cereal varieties. To replace present varieties of main&#13;
cereals such as rice, wheat and corn with new varieties to firther increase&#13;
yield by 10 percent;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
(d)   Increase in the business volume of state-owned companies. To increase&#13;
the business volume of state-owned companies from 3.5 mil tons to 5.0 mil&#13;
tons; and&#13;
(e)   Improvement in seed quality. To achieve at least the usage of national&#13;
class 2 seeds in all field crops.&#13;
2.24   Seed Legislation. Certain areas of seed law are to be amplified and strengthened,&#13;
while other aspects of the seed sector are to be deregulated. The overall effect will be to&#13;
facilitate comrnercial trade on the one hand and tighten official control of seed quality on&#13;
the other. The changes proposed by Government would have the effect of:&#13;
(a)    Simplifying the procedures for examination and approval of varieties for&#13;
cultivation and use and upgrading of the registration system;&#13;
(b)   Providing for intellectual property protection for plant cultivars;&#13;
(c)    Strengthening official inspection as a quality monitoring tool of the&#13;
government to ensure user protection;&#13;
(d)   Ending the current seed production monopoly and strengthening of seed&#13;
production contract between seed companies and farmers; and&#13;
(z)    Strengthening the requirement of marketers to label and package seeds in&#13;
accordance with prescribed standards.&#13;
2.25   Crop 'Variety Examination, Evaluation, Approval and Registration. Reforms&#13;
under consideration would aim at: (a) speeding up procedures at the provincial level with&#13;
automatic registration of provincially approved varieties in the National Registry;&#13;
(b) reducing t!.e minimum time required for the introduction of new varieties of strategic&#13;
crops to two years; (c) eliminating any distinction in terms of procedures or requirements&#13;
for domestic or imported varieties; (d) reducing the time required for most vegetable&#13;
crops, omamentals and other nonstrategic crops to a maximum of one year for&#13;
observation trials; and (e) permitting breeders of new varieties to name them.&#13;
2.26  Plant Breeder Rights. In September 1994, a series of seminars were organized&#13;
in China in ccnjunction with the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties&#13;
of Plants (UPOV) to discuss the legislative framework of intellectual property protection&#13;
for plants in the international context. In April 1995, a committee with members from&#13;
MOA, the Miinistry of Forestry and the Patent Bureau began drafting legislation for plant&#13;
breeder rights protection. The text of an initial draft was reviewed by an official from&#13;
UPOV in October 1995 to ensure conformity with the 1978 Act.&#13;
2.27  Seed Testing. The former National Seed Administration Station completed a&#13;
translation of the latest International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) rules and&#13;
procedures into (Chinese in 1994 as a prelude to strengthening seed quality testing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Manuals containing these rules and procedures were printed in early 1995 and officially&#13;
released on August 18, 1995 and will be widely distributed to seed companies and official&#13;
seee quality control laboratories. The NATESC laboratory is anticipating the completion&#13;
of new laboratory facilities in 1996 under the ASSP, after which time it will be in a&#13;
position to join ISTA.&#13;
2.28  Seed Production. 'The Government plans to extend seed production authorization&#13;
to allow production outside the breeding location, to allow foreign seed companies to&#13;
produce in China and to allow for contract seed multiplication for re-export. In times of&#13;
high seed denrand, contracts for seed production have often been broken by farmers,&#13;
causing trade problems for seed companies. The new seed law would attempt to address&#13;
this issue.&#13;
2.29  Seed Marketing. Currently, only seed companies are allowed to market seed&#13;
(except for farmer-to-farmer trade which is allowed). The Government proposes revision&#13;
that would allow any appropriately qualified body to market seed. A license will still be&#13;
required. The requirements for labeling and packaging of seed will be strengthened with&#13;
greater adherence to truthful labeling principles. Consumer information on labels would&#13;
be required. These provisions are directed at increasing the responsibility of the seed&#13;
marketing sector for product quality.&#13;
D. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREvIOus BANK GROUP PROJECTS&#13;
2.30 The Seeds Project (Cr. 1577-CHA), which was completed in 1990, provided&#13;
modern seed processing equipment and trained staff in sced processing, testing and&#13;
certification at 18 seed centers. The project was successful in establishing modem&#13;
processing facilities and expanding the capacity of some 80 seed production bases. The&#13;
project was less successful in introducing modern methods of seed quality assurance and&#13;
control procedures. The Project Management Office (PMO) established under the project&#13;
to supervise project implementation across 12 provinces and 2 autonomous regions was&#13;
very effective. The most important lessons were in the area of marketing and pricing as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)   Greater attention should have been given to estimating market demand for&#13;
the project's seed output. Estimates for conventional, self-pollinated grain&#13;
and oil seeds were too optimistic, resulting in substantial quantities of&#13;
unsold seed, which were disposed of as grain or feed. The shortfall in&#13;
demand occurred in part because, with increased freedom of action, farmers&#13;
used more of their own rather than purchased seed, and additionally because&#13;
of shifts in cropping patterns away from grain and oil seed crops.&#13;
(b)   The project should have provided for adequate processing margins based on&#13;
a full analysis of costs. The controlled seed prices anticipated by the project&#13;
were set at levels that in actual operation did not allow seed companies to&#13;
cover costs. Production of quality seed, made possible by the superior&#13;
equipment provided under the project, required among other things, a costly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
5-15 percent seed reject rate. Controlled prices for quality seed needed to be&#13;
set higher; or prices should have been liberalized.&#13;
2.31 The Agricultural Support Services Project (ASSP-Cr. 2462-CHA), which&#13;
became effective in 1993, assists in upgrading the facilities of 10 provincial, 14&#13;
prefecture and 41 county seed companies, in strengthening the plant quarantine system&#13;
ani in establishing a seed quality control system that is independent of seed companies.&#13;
It is significant that t.e Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA) current policy is that in the&#13;
future all provinces will be expected to establish external quality control systems that are&#13;
independent of szed companies.  It also contains a small pilot program  of&#13;
cor1;mercialization of three seed companies. A recent review of these model seed&#13;
companies revealed that they have become financially independent entities (although the&#13;
ownership of capital assets has yet to be resolved within the framework of State owned&#13;
enterprises) and have restructured their operations to take advantage of commercial&#13;
opportunities. The companies are doing very well. In all three cases, the Government&#13;
has provided budgetary financing for the seed quality control agencies.&#13;
2.32  Under the government policy at the time the ASSP was initiated, both seed&#13;
company management and regulation operated within a strict hierarchical structure with&#13;
the national agencies determining policy and the provinces conducting operations. The&#13;
system clearly did not allow for independent monitoring of the quality of the seed&#13;
reaching the market and therefore was an unsatisfactory procedure. Under the ASSP, the&#13;
Government agreed to institute policies requiring the separation of official seed quality&#13;
control from the commercial activities of the seed companies by transferring staff and&#13;
budget from the seed company structure to government regulatory agencies at provincial,&#13;
prefectural and county level in the target provinces. Financing was made available&#13;
through the Project to equip these regulatory agencies with vehicles and laboratory&#13;
equipment to operate an efficient and effective monitoring system.&#13;
2.33  Full implementation of the ASSP has not yet been completed and a recent review&#13;
revealed certain lessons learned in the management and implementation of the project&#13;
that will need to be applied in the proposed project as follows: (a) training delay can&#13;
affect project progress; and (b) delay in procurement of laboratory equipment can&#13;
severely curtail quality control activities and delay the separation of quality control from&#13;
production.&#13;
2.34 The Henan ADP (Cr. 2242-CHA), which became effective in August 23, 1991,&#13;
supported the construction of 20 seed processing centers to produce, process and market&#13;
good quality wheat, rice, corn and soybean seeds to meet existing and additional demand&#13;
in the project area. The centers are now in operation. Lessons learned from this project&#13;
have been used in designing this project, as follows: (a) the processing plants should be&#13;
close to the production base; (b) for efficient operation and convenient relocation, the&#13;
processing plants should be prefabricated; (c) the quality of seed stores is important in&#13;
keeping seeds in good condition; (d) adequate equipment technical specifications are&#13;
essential (to ensure that the equipment will incorporate new technology and that a service&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
contract, a supply of spare parts, installation and training of operators are included in the&#13;
bid package); and (e) processing lines should be procured as a single procurement&#13;
package from a single supplier to ensure that the responsibility for satisfactory operation&#13;
remains with o-.e company.&#13;
2.35  The Seed Development Project (SDP) (Ln. 3891-UA) in Ukraine, effective in&#13;
1995, also incorporates some relevant lessons learned in other Bank Group projects in,&#13;
among others, Indonesia, India and Pakistan. It aims to improve agricultural productivity&#13;
through increasing the supply of high-quality seeds for corn, sugar beets and sunflowers.&#13;
It would support the development of private seed production enterprises, improve the&#13;
regulatory framework and support germplasm maintenance and improvement. Lessons&#13;
reflected in this project are: (a) the ability of seed companies to operate independently is&#13;
crucial to private seed sector development; (b) price and trade liberalization are essential&#13;
to plomote seed trade and international cooperation; (c) technical assistance is required&#13;
for introdu_ing new management systems and preparing operating plans; (d) maintenance&#13;
and improvement of germplasm benefit from a research and development program and&#13;
from income generation from licensing of new varieties. These lessons have been taken&#13;
into consideration while preparing the proposed project.&#13;
E. RATIONALE FOR BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.36  The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board in June 1995&#13;
commits the Bank Group to assisting China to implement market-oriented reforms,&#13;
particularly the reform and restructuring of state enterprises. The proposed project would&#13;
support that strategy and enterprise restructuring by transferring technical and managerial&#13;
know-how to seed enterprises, which would also benefit from increased managerial and&#13;
fmancial autonomy. Involvement of the Bank Group in the project would, in addition,&#13;
allow it to contribute its experience to key aspects of the modemization and&#13;
commercialization- of the seed sector. Its experience in technology transfer would be a&#13;
particularly valuable contribution in the areas of advanced seed varieties, new seed&#13;
development techniques, good research management, efficient seed certification, modem&#13;
processing technology, effective quality control and appropriate effluent treatment. The&#13;
Bank Group's experience in commercialization in many countries in the areas of&#13;
enterprise govemance, market liberalization, private sector development, regulatory&#13;
development, reform sequencing, legal restructuring, financial development, and efficient&#13;
business practice would assist in the implementation of the project. Indeed, project&#13;
preparation itself has already assisted project staff and policy-makers in leaming about&#13;
development of commercial seed industries of other countries through seminars and a&#13;
study tour. It also facilitated the opening of links with multinational seed enterprises,&#13;
which may lead to possible joint ventures.&#13;
F. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
2.37  Modernization of the seed sector and the development of a commercial focus will&#13;
be ineffective without policy reform at all levels of government. The central government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
is committecl to developing a modem seed sector and has already begun to introduce a&#13;
number of policy reforms with respect to the liberalization of seed prices and the&#13;
separation of quality control from seed production. These are encouraging developments,&#13;
which began with the implementation of the ASSP, and need to be further developed and&#13;
consolidated. This proposed project would provide support for the separation of seed&#13;
quality management systems in four provinces (Guizhou, Shandong, Shanxi and&#13;
Zhejiang) not supported under the ASSP. This is essential if seed quality control is to be&#13;
improved in China. The project in addition would support a number of other policy&#13;
reformrs, in particular the liberalization of trade, the revision of the seed laws, the&#13;
development and implementation of plant breeders rights protection, the use of modem&#13;
ii'ternational standards for seed testing, the revision of the crop varietal evaluation and&#13;
registration system, and the development of a voluntary system of seed certification for&#13;
use in iaitemational trade in seed. All of these developments are under active review by&#13;
the authorities in China.&#13;
2.3R   China s seed sector is in a transitional stage. As described in para. 2.17, seed&#13;
compariaes are still state owned enterprises (SOEs). The government is seriously&#13;
discussing overall state enterprise reform and such general reforms will affect seed&#13;
enterprises. State-owned seed enterprises are also subject to their own regime of controls&#13;
and guidance. Seed pricing and trade are still not fully liberalized for certain strategic&#13;
crops, and only vegetable and horticulture seeds are fully liberalized. Under these&#13;
circumstances, profitable seed enterprises have been able to develop a mix of activities,&#13;
augmenting production of less profitable conventional grain seeds with production of&#13;
more profitable hybrid grain seeds and those sold in liberalized vegetable and horticulture&#13;
markets. Since it is likely that the seed sector will still not be fully liberalized within the&#13;
next three years, the overall rationale for the project is therefore the development of the&#13;
foundations of a commercial seed industry by modernizing those forward looking seed&#13;
enterprises that could subsequently become the leading companies in a national seed&#13;
industry, after SOE reforms and fuller liberalization of prices and trade in the seed&#13;
industry have taken effect.&#13;
2.39   Stated in other terms, the project aims to commercialize the seed sector, not&#13;
necessarily to privatize it. Commercialization under the project would increase efficiency&#13;
by improving management and creating incentives for seed enterprises to behave like&#13;
seed enterprises in other countries. All companies would be required to provide an&#13;
opening balance sheet with all items, including transferred equity valued according to the&#13;
1993 accounting standards.&#13;
2.40   The project would not directly address the social responsibilities of the seed&#13;
companies.  Project companies would not provide housing, but rather compensate&#13;
workers with. higher salaries. Companies would provide for pensions and health&#13;
insurance rather than direct provision.&#13;
2.41   Seed enterprises will evolve within the framework of a facilitative national seed&#13;
sector policy. But without a program of support to evolving firms, this evolution could&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
be too slow to generate an efficient seed industry in a reasonable time frame or even to&#13;
sustain the momentum of commercialization. What is needed is a nucleus group of&#13;
active, technolugically adept, competitive seed companies. At preparation, almost 100&#13;
seed enterprises were interested in joining the project. Bank Group missions established&#13;
technical, financial and business criteria to evaluate their proposed investments, business&#13;
and marketing plans and selected 31 seed enterprises and one seed machinery firm.&#13;
These seed enterprises are located in Fujian, Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Hubei,&#13;
Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Sichuan and Zhejiang. The seed machinery&#13;
firm is located in Shanghai. The selection criteria were as follows:&#13;
(a)   Technical: The proposals for the production, processing, storage and&#13;
marketing of seeds are technically feasible.  Production would meet&#13;
national quality specifications (or international specifications where&#13;
exports were proposed).&#13;
(b)   Business Risk: The proposal adequately addresses the commercial and&#13;
business risks associated with creating or expanding production, processing&#13;
and marketing operations. The enterprise would have more than one&#13;
product line and would not be reliant on untried or new products or&#13;
processes.&#13;
(c)   Funding Adequacy: The firn would provide at least 20 percent of their&#13;
oNvn equity and would have government guarantees for the repayment of the&#13;
project loan, counterpart funding and loans for working capital.&#13;
(d)   Investment Analysis: The investment and production plan would produce&#13;
sufficient financial rate of return to support the loan repayments, interest on&#13;
the loans, and dividends to shareholders, in addition to providing funds for&#13;
investnent in long tern growth, even at 80 percent production capacity or&#13;
with variation of 10 percent in production costs and selling prices.&#13;
Assurances werc obtained that subloans would be made for subprojects that are&#13;
determined, on the basis of guidelines acceptable to the Bank Group, to be technically&#13;
feasible and economically, financially and commercially viable.&#13;
2.42  In addition, eligibility criteria were established for provinces to be included in the&#13;
project so as to ensure successful implementation of the project at the provincial level.&#13;
These criteria were agreed during negotiations as follows:&#13;
(a)    Separation of extemal quality control from the seed companies, and the&#13;
provincial government guarantee of budgetary support for the external&#13;
quality control agencies after its separation (para. 3.7).&#13;
(b)   Acceptance of at least one seed company for inclusion in the project.&#13;
(c)   Execution of project implementation agreements (PIAs) with MOF and&#13;
MOA (para. 4.5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The main objective of the project is to assist the Government in developing a&#13;
viable commercial seed sector, which can not only produce high quality seeds in&#13;
sufficient quantity and variety to satisfy farmer needs but also operates through efficient,&#13;
self-sustained commercial enterprises.&#13;
3.2   The project would assist in the commercialization of the seed sector by:&#13;
(a) helping the Government establish a seed policy and a regulatory framework that&#13;
would enhance the competitiveness of the seed sector and encourage international&#13;
cooperation, (b) supporting the modernization and rationalization of selected seed&#13;
companies, and (c) assisting in strengthening institutions so they can provide effective&#13;
service and technical support to the seed sector.&#13;
B. PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
3.3   The project would have three major components as follows:&#13;
(a)   Policy and Regulatory Framework;&#13;
(b)   Commercialization of Selected Seed Companies; and&#13;
(c)   Institutional Strengthening.&#13;
C. DETAILED FEATURES&#13;
Policy and Regulatory Framework&#13;
3.4   This component is designed to:&#13;
(a)   Assist the Governmenit with assessment and, where needed, strengthening of&#13;
seed laws, regulations and administrative instructions in respect of the&#13;
official examination and approval of cultivars for use, authorization for seed&#13;
production and commercialization activities, labeling and packaging&#13;
standards and strengthening of seed inspection and quarantine provisions;&#13;
and&#13;
(b)   Assist the development and implementation of a suitable legal framnework&#13;
for protection of plant breeders rights legislation and the Government's&#13;
accession to the UPOV convention on intellectual property protection for&#13;
plants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.5   MOA is in the initial phase of strengthening national seed legislation and&#13;
operating regulations and implementation protocols.  The general thrust of new&#13;
legislation has been developed and the areas to be strengthened have been identified. It is&#13;
important for the effective operation of the project, which aims to facilitate&#13;
commercialization of the seed sector, that this process be expedited and that the new&#13;
legislation is both comprehensive and facilitative of international trade in seeds. The&#13;
project would provide a few person-months of technical assistance to assist the seed law&#13;
drafting committee in reviewing technical parameters and the draft seed laws. A study&#13;
tour would be provided for four persons for two weeks during the early part of project&#13;
implementation, to study application of seed laws and seed labeling as a quality control&#13;
mechanism in seed marketing.&#13;
3.6   The government intends to develop and implement a legal framework for the&#13;
protection of intellectual property rights for plant varieties. This legal protection is&#13;
vitally important for the acquisition of new varieties by seed companies and would&#13;
buttress the commercial viability of the seed marketing sector. In addition to providing&#13;
for plant variety protection within the country, the Government has indicated its desire to&#13;
accede to the 1978 Act of the UPOV Convention to facilitate international trade and&#13;
access to improved germplasm of crop species from abroad. The legal framework will&#13;
therefore need to be compatible with the provisions of the 1978 Act of UPOV as well as&#13;
having the appropriate operatioiial mechanisms for its effective operation in China. The&#13;
prcject would provide for an international legal expert, preferably from UPOV, to assist&#13;
the technical group in China to finalize the proposed framework. It would also provide&#13;
an additional study tour for four persons for two weeks to study application of plant&#13;
breeders' right registrations.&#13;
3.7   The Government's policy is to separate internal seed quality management by seed&#13;
companies from official seed quality control by regulatory agencies (para. 2.32). In 1995,&#13;
separation was carried out in eight provinces under the ASSP; namely Liaoning,&#13;
Shanghai, Hunan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Jiangsu and Shaanxi. The other ASSP provinces,&#13;
Heilongjiang and Hebei, are expected to achieve separation by the end of 1996 upon&#13;
completion of office and laboratory buildings and the procurement of laboratory&#13;
equipment, providing remaining budget problems are solved.  Since a complete&#13;
separation is essential to further reform under this project, a condition of eligibility to&#13;
participate in the project would be that the provinces have completed the above-&#13;
mentioned separation and established a suitable, financially sustainable system of seed&#13;
quality control.&#13;
Commercialization of Selected Seed Companies&#13;
3.8   The main objective of this component would be to prepare a core group of about&#13;
31 active, technically adept and competitive seed companies as a foundation for a viable&#13;
commercial seed sector-15 seed companies and 16 state farm companies.  These&#13;
enterprises would introduce new genetic materials, improve seed quality and strengthen&#13;
their institutional, marketing and sales networks by forming liaisons with Chinese and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
foreign institutions, suppliers and marketing agencies. The project would encourage joint&#13;
venture agreements with foreign suppliers to upgrade the seed processing equipment and&#13;
technology of the companies. A detailed description of the selected companies and a&#13;
summarv of their business plans can be found in Annex 1.&#13;
3.9   These companies would, upon completion of agreed eligibility requirements for&#13;
participation in the project, receive subloans from their respective provinces to carry out&#13;
the following activities:&#13;
(a)   Improve Company Seed Production Bases. In order to develop their&#13;
production bases, a number of the seed companies need investment in land&#13;
development, irrigation facilities, drainage, power supply and rural roads.&#13;
The project would also finance farm machinery and equipment such as&#13;
tractors, trailers and seed drills.&#13;
(b)   Improved Variety of Seed. The project would assist about half of the&#13;
companies in improving their seed stock by producing or purchasing new&#13;
genetic materials or improved varieties of seed. The project would finance&#13;
the purchase of domestic and international license agreements for new&#13;
varieties, new parent lines from research institutes for multiplication,&#13;
construction of greenhouses, development of mother-tree gardens, and&#13;
equipment for dissue culture laboratories. It would also finance a small&#13;
quantity of production inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides.&#13;
(c)   Improve Storage and Processing Facilities. Incremental production under&#13;
the project would need to have proper storage facilities and improved&#13;
processing technologies in order to increase the quality of the seeds. A&#13;
number of companies proposed to enlarge their storage areas. A few&#13;
companies proposed cold storage facilities and seed silos. Most of the&#13;
companies requested finance for construction of processing facilities,&#13;
including processing equipment, drying floors and buildings to house&#13;
processing equipment, power and boiler equipment and seed storage areas.&#13;
The processing line equipment would include intake conveyors, intake&#13;
storage bins, driers, cleaners, graders, sorters, coating machines, weighers,&#13;
packing machines, associated switchgear and control panels. The equipment&#13;
would be supplied as integrated processing lines, the design of which would&#13;
depend on the seeds to be processed. Capacities would be either 1.5 t/hr,&#13;
3 t/hr or 5 t/hr.  Some cotton seed producers require acid delinting&#13;
machinery. The investment would also include design and commissioning&#13;
costs, spare parts and chemicals for seed treatment. Two person months of&#13;
technical assistance would be required to assist in preparing technical&#13;
specifications and bidding documents for these processing equipment.&#13;
(d)   Internal Quality Control. The project would finance construction of small&#13;
laboratories and supply them with equipment for quality control according&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
to International Seed Testing Authority standards. Depending on the size of&#13;
the company, the labs would be equipped and staffed to handle between&#13;
2,000 to 5,000 samples per year.  Staff would be trained in modem&#13;
inspection procedures.&#13;
(e)   Company Management. The project would provide technical assistance to&#13;
each company in the area of management. Several companies are in the&#13;
process of consolidation and are changing the structure of their management.&#13;
The project would provide technical assistance and training in the following&#13;
management areas: management of the enterprise, financial control, seed&#13;
handling technology, and plant operation and maintenance. Joint ventures&#13;
with foreign companies would be encouraged under the project as a means&#13;
to  improve  company  management.   The  project would  finance&#13;
refurbishment of office buildings and provide vehicles, computers, office&#13;
equipment and training equipment.&#13;
(f)    Marketing and Pricing.  The project emphasizes effective marketing.&#13;
Thus, the project would provide training to managers and staff in market&#13;
analysis, sales strategies and effective pricing. The project would encourage&#13;
the establishment of sales networks and alliances with other companies in&#13;
other provinces and countries and help seed companies develop the capacity&#13;
to gather market intelligence and collect and analyze data. The project&#13;
would finance construction of sales offices, office equipment, showrooms,&#13;
storage rooms and retail stores. To improve distribution of seed, the project&#13;
would finance the procurement of trucks and other vehicles.&#13;
(g)   Initial Seed Stock. Seed stock is a major part of the materials requirement&#13;
tor the seed companies. Seed companies generally purchase seeds after&#13;
harvesting, and process and store them for six months or more until the&#13;
subsequent year's planting season. Lack of operating funds has been a&#13;
major constraint limiting quantities purchased and processed. Under this&#13;
project, there would be a need for $57.4 million to nurchase the initial stock&#13;
of seed. The project would finance 50 percent of the stock purchased. The&#13;
rest would be financed by commercial banks. Insofar as the seed stocks&#13;
embody improved genetics, the investment in such stocks constitutes an&#13;
investment in advanced technology.&#13;
(h)   Seed Machinery.  The project would support the modernization of&#13;
Shanghai Xiangmin Machinery Company, which manufactures a wide range&#13;
of agricultural machinery and seed processing equipment. The company is&#13;
well recognized as providing good seed processing equipment, including 20&#13;
sets for the Henan ADP financed by IDA (para. 2.34). The company lacks&#13;
good designs for key equipment such as air screen separators and gravity&#13;
tables. It also needs high quality machine tools, screen presses and&#13;
perforators to produce accurate drum separators and screens. The company&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
does not have computer aided design (CAD) facilities, which are now used&#13;
by most foreign suppliers to produce plant layout drawings to each client's&#13;
requirements, or computer aided manufacturing (CAM) equipment, which&#13;
translates CAD designs into shop floor manufacturing instructions.&#13;
The project would finance the construction of a new workshop, necessary&#13;
machine tools and CAD/CAM design and manufacturing equipment. To&#13;
upgrade their processing equipment technology, the best approach would be&#13;
a joint venture with a seed equipment manufacturer. Should such a joint&#13;
venture be established, the project would finance a contract for technology&#13;
transfer on a direct-contract basis.&#13;
3.10 The total base cost of the investment in this component is estimated at Y 1,390&#13;
million.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
3.11  The project would strengthen government institutions which provide services to&#13;
the seed sector as follows:&#13;
(a)   Variety examination, release and protection:&#13;
(i)    National Crop Variety Examination and Approval Committee&#13;
Office (NCVEACO). The objective is to develop the present&#13;
NCVEACO into a variety release and protection office. The two&#13;
subcomponents to be established and developed are computerization&#13;
of variety information and establishment of a plant variety protection&#13;
implementation unit.   NCVEACO  would be provided with&#13;
additional staff. The project would provide a computer system and&#13;
computer training, other training, study tours and workshops on the&#13;
protection of new plant varieties, and a small prefabricated cold&#13;
store. The investrnent cost is estimated at Y 1.4 million.&#13;
(ii)    Provincial Crop Variety Examination and Approval Offices.&#13;
Similar interventions are planned for the four project seed&#13;
administration stations in four provinces. The cost is included in the&#13;
investment cost of the individual seed management stations.&#13;
(b)   Seed quality control and seed certification:&#13;
(i)    National Seed Testing Center (NSTC). NSTC of the National&#13;
Agricultural Technical Extension Center would be equipped and its&#13;
staff trained to initiate pilot work on management and certification of&#13;
fruit tree seedlings and ornamental plants for later introduction&#13;
throughout China. The investment cost would be Y 2.0 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
(ii)    Provincial Seed Administration Stations. The project aims to&#13;
ensure the existence in the project provinces of an official&#13;
independent seed regulation and control system, including a working&#13;
"truth in labeling" mechanism and a voluntary seed certification&#13;
system. Most project provinces already have independent quality&#13;
control agencies, with assistance from the ASSP. The project would&#13;
support the establishment of such independent quality control&#13;
agencies in Guizhou, Shandong, Zhejiang and Shanxi Provinces,&#13;
which did not benefit from the ASSP in thls regard. For these&#13;
provinces, the project would support seed laboratory and office&#13;
construction, seed testing equipment, greenhouses, vehicles and&#13;
computers, and local and foreign training on field inspection,&#13;
laboratory testing and cross-check testing. The total investment cost&#13;
in the four provinces would be Y 36.1 million.&#13;
3.12  Strengthening of the Central Project Management Office (CPMO).  The&#13;
CPMO would raise part of its operating funds through management fees charged to the&#13;
seed companies. The project would support project management by providing office&#13;
equipment, training and study tours. It would also provide operating funds (not Bank-&#13;
financed) and training to carry out the supervision, monitoring and evaluation required&#13;
under the project.&#13;
Informal Seed Sector&#13;
3.13  It is claimed that about 20-25 percent of the self-pollinating, conventional seeds&#13;
needed in China are obtained from seed companies/stations, while the rest are seeds saved&#13;
by farmers for planting the next crop. If this estimate of the rate of seed replacement is&#13;
correct, it is higher in China than in other countries in the region with well developed&#13;
crop agriculture. While the rate of seed replacement for self-pollinated crops in China&#13;
appears to be at a level judged to be satisfactory by Chinese farmers and many&#13;
professional agronomists (seed prices are quite low and there do not appear to be any&#13;
general and chronic supply shortages), a government decision has been made to increase&#13;
the seed replacement rate gradually to about 40 percent through organized seed&#13;
promotion campaigns. In fact, there is no substantial and consistent evidence in other&#13;
countries or in China that conventional self-pollinating crop replacement seeds from local&#13;
seed companies are significantly more productive than seeds of the same variety saved&#13;
on-farm for planting and therefore no evidence that there would be substantial economic&#13;
gains from the considerable effort that would be involved in these campaigns.&#13;
3.14  The project would finance relatively simple surveys and studies to provide good&#13;
data on the relative performance of farmer saved and company-supplied seeds, which&#13;
could be used by the seed companies in marketing and for guidance on the type and&#13;
degree of involvement in production/marketing of self-pollinating seeds. The surveys/&#13;
studies would be done for two years for relatively modest costs by selected provincial&#13;
seed management administrations for conventional rice and soybeans in Shandong and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
wheat in Henan. An appropriate model for the surveys/studies would be the so-called&#13;
planter box seed surveys, i.e., samples collected from farmers as they are planting their&#13;
crop. The cost of six such surveys of three crops is estimated to be about Y 65,000.&#13;
Details can be found in Annex 2.&#13;
3.15  Pilot Program. The objective of the pilot program is to give more intense attention&#13;
to three companies receive subloans under the commercialization component of the project&#13;
and provide them with training and technical assistance to ensure successful&#13;
implementation of activities promoted under the project. The preparation team has already&#13;
given special assistance to the three pilot companies by reviewing their proposed internal&#13;
management structure and their business and marketing plans. The companies are required&#13;
to provide an opening balance sheet with all items, including transferred equity, valued&#13;
according to generally accepted accounting principles (para. 2.39). They would minimize&#13;
expenditures on social services, substituting higher wages and salaries for such things as&#13;
free housing for permanent employees and hiring temporary workers in the peak season&#13;
rather than permanent staff. They would also provide insurance plans for pensions and&#13;
health coverage, rather than providing these items directly. They would have effective&#13;
quality assurance systems, which would not only test seeds but also ensure the production&#13;
of high quality seed. Benchmarks have been established for the three pilot companies and&#13;
would be closely monitored during supervision. At the mid-term review, progress would be&#13;
evaluated and the experience gained from the pilot program shared with the other project&#13;
seed companies. Description of the pilot program can be found in Annex 3.&#13;
3.16  The three pilot companies are being developed from (a) a state farm seed&#13;
company, CD) a prefecture seed company, and (c) a provincial seed company. The&#13;
proposed operations of these companies will represent three different company structures,&#13;
all of which could be adopted by other entities pursuing the objective of&#13;
commercialization.&#13;
3. 1 7 The state farm model is based on Zhangqiu Leek Seed Company (ZLSC), a seed&#13;
business that is io be spun off from the state farm and establish itself as a limited liability&#13;
company. The company would have a Board of Directors to give guidance on all major&#13;
operating and financial issues. This company would have a licensing agreement with&#13;
ZhLtngqiu Municipal Leek Research Institute (ZMLRI), the only institute in China which&#13;
has de,-doped new varieties of leek. ZLSC would be responsible for the production and&#13;
marketing of foundation and commercial seed. The general manager of the company&#13;
would have autonomy for company management. He would be assisted by two deputies,&#13;
one being responsible for finance and marketing, the other responsible for seed&#13;
production and conditioning. The company would establish an internal quality control&#13;
system reporting directly to the management of the general manager.&#13;
3.18 The company would arrange with ZMLRI to be supplied with new, improved&#13;
germplasm on a regular basis. ZMLRI would have the responsibility of describing these&#13;
varieties and obtaining protection under plant breeder rights regulations. ZLSC would&#13;
have the responsibility of ensuring varietal purity so that the marketed product truly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29-&#13;
reflects the characteristics described by ZMLRI. ZLSC would pay a license fee (royalty)&#13;
to ZMLRI for the right to produce and market the products developed by the institute,&#13;
and this license would be established as a percentage of the price at which ZLSC sells its&#13;
seed. This arrangement would significantly change the marketing of seeds; ZLSC would&#13;
regularly launch new products into the market and it would have to manage "product&#13;
cycles" including the phasing out of products on the decline.&#13;
3.19 ZiBo Prefecture Seed Compoany (ZPSC), a prefecture company model, would&#13;
operate as a limited liability company. ZPSC would have a Board of Directors to monitor&#13;
and guide the actions of management. The company intends to continue operating as a&#13;
stand-alone operation but to increase its market share in hybrid com and to expand&#13;
interregional marketing of vegetable seeds. It has an in-house research program for&#13;
Chinese cabbage and recently acquired the production and marketing rights to a corn&#13;
hybrid.&#13;
3.20  In vegetable seeds, ZPSC has about 1,400 accessions of Chinese cabbage as its&#13;
proprietary germplasm pool, and its research effort is directed towards the development&#13;
of hybrid.;. While the company considers its genetic basis sufficient and its hybrids&#13;
superior as regards quality and earliness, ZPSC would change its products release policy&#13;
to regularly launch new products, as described above for Zhangqiu, and also seek&#13;
protection of new varieties under PBR. ZPSC would begin significant efforts to identify&#13;
other sources of improved germplasm nationally and intemationally (for Chinese&#13;
cabbage, com and other crops). These products would be secured for the company either&#13;
through licensing or otherwise. The company currently has production and marketing&#13;
rights for a hybrid com developed by Shandong Agricultural Research Institute.&#13;
3.21  ZPSC has already established proprietary packaging for "ZiBo Cabbage Seed,"&#13;
which clearly distinguishes it from any other source; this package also has created a brand&#13;
image for the company in the interregional market. The company would accomplish its&#13;
sales objectives by building on and expanding this brand identity. ZPSC currently sells&#13;
its corn seeds within the prefecture; the company recently concluded contractual&#13;
arrangements with 6 county seed companies to sell ZPSC corn seeds exclusively. ZPSC&#13;
would also pursue sales opportunities outside the prefecture, most likely through some of&#13;
its vegetable seed dealers. The company expects this strategy to be successful and&#13;
projects an increase in sales of corn seeds from 500 tons to 5,000 tons annually.&#13;
3.22 Guangxi Provincial Seed Company (GPSC), a provincial seed company model,&#13;
decided to convert to a limited liability stock company whose shareholders would be five&#13;
county seed companies in addition to the province. The management of the company&#13;
would be supervised by a board of directors elected by the shareholders. The company&#13;
would be managed by a general manager who would not be a member of the board; this&#13;
general manager would be assisted by three deputies. One deputy general manager would&#13;
be responsible for seed production and conditioning, one for sales and marketing, and one&#13;
for finance and administration. The departments of quality assurance and new product&#13;
evaluation will report directly to the general manager. The company would operate from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
its central location in Nanning where it also maintains its foundation seed farm; away&#13;
from this center there will be five seed production locations and one sales office near the&#13;
Viet Nam border. They would produce hybrid rice, hybrid corn, peanuts and kenaf seeds.&#13;
3.23   The shareholders would contribute to the company the right to use certain&#13;
facilities for the production of seeds; five seed conditioning lines would be installed at&#13;
these facilities. The shareholders would also make available to GPSC certain personnel&#13;
during the harvest and conditioning season to allow the company to manage its seed crop&#13;
and to keep its permanent staff at a minimum. GPSC would have, through its own staff,&#13;
supervisory responsibility for operating and maintaining all seed production operations.&#13;
The number of shares held by each shareholder would be determined based on the value&#13;
of their contributions.&#13;
3.24  The clepartment for the evaluation of new varieties will perform  a critical&#13;
function, as none of the companies forming GPSC has any proprietary products or&#13;
research programs or holds any licenses to such products. GPSC therefore must urgently&#13;
obtain new varieties for testing from both national and international sources and evaluate&#13;
them at multiple locations throughout the province and in the interregional markets.&#13;
GPSC has been put in contact with potential international sources for new varieties and&#13;
the implementation of an accelerated testing program for such new products will be one&#13;
benchmark b) which this company will be evaluated.&#13;
D. STATUS OF PREPARATION&#13;
3.25 The Crovernment is seriously committed to the policy and regulatory reforms.&#13;
Several activities have been initiated and have estimated dates for completion. However,&#13;
the speed of change will depend on the economic and political situation of the country.&#13;
The government has concurred on the need for technical assistance, as provided for in the&#13;
project (draft TORs in Annex 8). Detailed government institutional strengthening has&#13;
been developed by the concerned institutions.&#13;
3.26  The preparation for commercializing seed companies is well-advanced.  All&#13;
participating seed enterprises have submitted feasibility reports, containing data on their&#13;
seed production, processing, storage and marketing plans. Most enterprises have also&#13;
provided preliminary designs and specifications for their administrative buildings, trading&#13;
and retail cenlers, storage buildings and processing plants.&#13;
3.27  Detailed investment schedules have been prepared, together with production and&#13;
operating cost schedules, cash flow statements, working capital computations, and&#13;
financing plans. Local government guarantees have been secured by the participating&#13;
seed enterprises for repayment of their Bank Group-financed subloans and for provision&#13;
of counterp3: funds and working capital. Each enterprise has presented audited annual&#13;
accounts to show that they have 20 percent equity available for investment in their project&#13;
component. All of these documents are satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
E. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
3.28  The proposed project would be implemented over a five-year period, starting from&#13;
1996 through 2001. Investment in land development, civil works and buildings would&#13;
start in year one, while niachinery and equipment delivery and installation would start in&#13;
year two. In preparation for project implementation, training for personnel of the seed&#13;
enterprises and the PMOs would be in the first two years. The seed enterprises are&#13;
projected to start incremental production in year three or year four. This scheduling is&#13;
considered reasenable, given that almost all the seed enterprises are already involved in&#13;
seed processing and have experienced staff. Seed company's key activities schedules can&#13;
be seen in Figure 2.&#13;
F. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.29  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, is estimated at&#13;
Y 1,824 million or $185.5 million at the existing initial exchange rate of Y 8.4 to $1. The&#13;
foreign exchange component is estimated at $63.8 million or 34 percent of total project&#13;
cost. The base cost estimates are computed from unit prices prevailing at the time of&#13;
appraisal in October 1995. The total costs include value added taxes and import duties of&#13;
$26.5 million or 14 percent of total project costs. Physical contingencies are estimated at&#13;
15 percent for equipment, 10 percent for materials and vehicles, 5 percent for civil works&#13;
and zero for seed stocks, working capital, technical assistance, training, management cost&#13;
and labor. Price contingencies are based on annual international price escalation rates for&#13;
all goods and services when expressed in US dollars of 3.3 percent in 1996, 2.3 percent in&#13;
1997 and 2.5 percent from 1998 to 2001. Total contingencies over the five-year period&#13;
amount to 8 percent of base costs in US dollars. When expressed in Yuan, annual price&#13;
escalation rates of 17.5 percent were used for 1996 and 8.5 percent, 7.0 percent, 6.5&#13;
percent, 6.2 percent and 6.2 percent for 1997-2001. Total contingencies amount to 26&#13;
percent of base costs expressed in Yuan.&#13;

G. FINANCING&#13;
3.30 Bank Group financing would be an IDA credit of SDR 13.8 million ($20 million&#13;
equivalent) and an IBRD Loan of $80 million. This would cover 54 percent of total&#13;
project cost. The remaining 46 percent would be financed by national and provincial&#13;
governments, commercial banks and self-raised funds. The contributions from each&#13;
source are as follows:&#13;
$ Million&#13;
(a)  IDA Credit                                                                               20.0&#13;

H. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.31  All procurement of works and goods would be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
Bank CGroup's guidelines for procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January&#13;
1995 and revised in January 1996, and all procurement would use China model bidding&#13;
documents, prepared in consultation with the Bank Group, and based on the Bank&#13;
Group's standard bidding documents for ICB. Procurement arrangements are detailed in&#13;
Annex 4, Table 5 and summarized in Table 3.2 on the following page.&#13;
3.32 Works. Project works consisting of civil works and buildings valued at $31.4&#13;
million, are widely dispersed in 14 provinces and would be difficult to consolidate into&#13;
larger packages. All of them are relatively small, the largest being less than $2.0 million,&#13;
and would therefore, not be of interest to foreign contractors. Approximately 81 percent&#13;
of works ($25.4 million) would be procured on the basis of National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank Group. All buildings, valued at $22.2 million,&#13;
would be procured on the basis of NCB. Building construction contracts would cover the&#13;
supply of construction materials and the construction work at each project site. Of the&#13;
civil works ($9.2 million), including land development and earth works for access road&#13;
and irrigation ditches, only 35 percent ($3.2 million) can be packaged for NCB&#13;
procurement. The remaining civil works valued at $6 million are small and widely&#13;
scattered throughout the project and will not be of interest to contractors. They would&#13;
therefore be undertaken through force account managed by county engineers in&#13;
coordination with the seed companies.&#13;
3.33  Goods. To an extent practicable, contracts for goods shall be grouped in bid&#13;
packages estimated to cost $200,000 equivalent or more each. Project goods consisting&#13;
of machinery, equipment, vehicles and materials are estimated at $61.1 million. ICB&#13;
procedures would be used for seed processing equipment ($26.2 million), truck and&#13;
utility vehicles ($4.5 million) and fertilizer ($11.0 million), valued at $41.7 million or 68&#13;
percent of all goods. Domestic manufacturers would be allowed a margin of preference&#13;
on ICB equal to 15 percent of the c.i.f. price of imported goods or the prevailing custom&#13;
duty, whichever is lower.&#13;
3.34  Small office and electrical equipment ($2.2 million), farm  machinery and&#13;
implements ($0.8 million), and other equipment ($0.7 million) would be dispersed in&#13;
location, spread over the project period and subject to continuing after-sale service&#13;
requirements to the extent that none of them can be grouped in packages of more than&#13;
$200,000 and would therefore be unlikely to be of interest to foreign suppliers without a&#13;
significant local presence. They would, therefore, normally be procured under contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank Group.&#13;

- 35 -&#13;
3.35  Goods that should be procured as an extension of an existing contract or must be&#13;
purchased from the original supplier to be compatible with existing equipment or are of a&#13;
proprietary nature may, with the Bank Group's prior agreement, be procured on the basis&#13;
of direct contracting. A technology transfer package from a joint venture partner, valued&#13;
at $2.0 million, would be procured on a direct contract basis acceptable to the Bank&#13;
Group. Specialized equipment for quality control laboratories, valued at $2.5 million,&#13;
and a small amount of fertilizer costing less than $50,000 per contract and pesticides,&#13;
valued at $2.6 million, would be procured through LIB. Due to the specialized nature of&#13;
the genetic materials required under the project and the limited number of suppliers of&#13;
such materials, 77 percent ($2 million) of the procurement of germplasm and seed&#13;
licenses, valued at more than $200,000 per contract, would be procured through LIB, and&#13;
23 percent ($0.6 million), valued at less than $200,000 per contract, would be procured&#13;
through national shopping (with at least three quotations).&#13;
3.36  Of market surveys valued at $5.1 million, 70 percent ($3.6 million) would be&#13;
contracted out on an NCB basis. The remaining 30 percent ($1.5 million), composed of&#13;
small contracts for remote seed companies, valued at less than $50,000 for each contract,&#13;
would be procured by national shopping (with at least three quotations). Procurement of&#13;
very small orders and various miscellaneous materials, estimated at less than $50,000&#13;
each, valued at $0.2 million would be by national shopping. Procurement of seed stock&#13;
by the 31 seed companies over the period of three years, valued at $57.4 million, would&#13;
be by direct purchase according to the companies' production contracts with farmers,&#13;
which would be specified in their business development plans.&#13;
3.37  Training and Technical Assistance would cost $2.6 million in total, of which&#13;
$0.2 million would be for foreign-supplied expertise ($43,800 for institutional&#13;
strengthening, $123,000 for policy and $52,900 for project implementation), $1.5 million&#13;
for international training and study tours, and $0.9 million for domestic training and&#13;
research. Employment of all consultants would be in accordance with Bank Group&#13;
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants, and the Bank Group Standard Form of Contract&#13;
for consultants' services dated June 1995 would be used. Domestic and international&#13;
training and study tours would be according to annual plans acceptable to the Bank&#13;
Group.&#13;
3.38  Land acquisition and compensation for lost crops ($4.5 million), working capital&#13;
($1.1 million), recurrent costs ($0.7 million) and taxes and duties ($26.5 million), a total&#13;
of $32.8 million, would be locally funded. Passenger vehicles, valued at $0.8 million,&#13;
would be provided by the provincial governments and seed enterprises. Equipment,&#13;
training and technical assistance for the seed offices in Beijing, valued at $0.4 million,&#13;
would be provided by the Ministry of Agriculture.&#13;
3.39 IDA/World Bank Review. All procurement for works and goods in excess of&#13;
$200,000 or more would be subject to prior review and approval. That would cover 75&#13;
percent of the civil works and buildings and about 93 percent of goods under ICB and&#13;
NCB procurement and would consist of approximately 60 contracts. Other contracts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
would be subject to ex-post review by supervision missions. In addition, in view of the&#13;
large number of contracts likely to be secured under NCB procedures, the CPMO would&#13;
use standard documents approved by the World Bank for these contracts. Consultant&#13;
contracts costing $100,000 or more for firms and $50,000 for individuals would be&#13;
subject to prior review. In addition, all terms of reference and sole-source selections of&#13;
ccisu!tants, regardless of the contract value, are subject to the Bank Group's prior&#13;
review.&#13;
1. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.,0  Disbursement for equipment, machinery, vehicles, licenses and materials would&#13;
be n.Tade at 100 percent of foreign expenuitures for direct imports, 100 percent of the&#13;
local, ex-factoiy cost for locally manufactured items, and 75 percent of expenditures for&#13;
other items procured locally. Disbursement against civil works would be 50 percent of&#13;
expenditures. Disbursement for seed stock wouid be 50 percent of the seed purchase.&#13;
Disbursement For training, study tours and consultant services would be at 100 percent of&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
3.41   Disbursements would be made against statements of expenditure in the case of&#13;
overseas training, study tours, and contracts for goods and works costing less than&#13;
$200,000 and consultant contracts costing less than $100,000 for firms and $50,000 for&#13;
individual. A condition of disbursement for the seed stock for each subproject would be&#13;
that operation plans for the subproject acceptable to the Bank Group have been prepared&#13;
and the subproject's seed processing lines have been installed and are ready for&#13;
operation. Disbursements for all works carried out under force account would be made&#13;
against statements of physical progress achieved at each site at unit prices agreed with the&#13;
Bank Group at the start of the project and subject to annual review. In order to facilitate&#13;
disbursement, Special Account would be opened at a commercial bank acceptable to the&#13;
Bank Group, with an initial deposit of $6.0 million, representing the average of four&#13;
months eligible expenditures. Applications for replenishment of these accounts would be&#13;
submitted monthly or when the account is drawn down to 50 percent of its initial deposit.&#13;
Retroactive finincing for training and preparation activities necessary for a smooth start-&#13;
up of the project, up to SDR 5.8 million ($8.4 million equivalent), would be made against&#13;
expenditures made between October 15, 1995 and the date of signing of the Loan/Credit&#13;
Agreement.&#13;
3.42  The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2001, and the closing date&#13;
would be June 30, 2002. Disbursement experience in China has been favorable and better&#13;
than Bank-Group-wide and East Asia regional averages. The project disbursement&#13;
profile is essenlially in line with that for previous agricultural development and institution&#13;
building projects in China. The estimated disbursement schedule is given in Annex 4&#13;
Table 6.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
J. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
3.43  Records of expenditures on civil works, equipment and materials would be&#13;
maintained individually by the participating seed companies. The records would be&#13;
consolidated by the project provincial PMOs for review and submission to the CPMO at&#13;
MOA in Beijing. The provincial PMOs would make sure that the accounts are audited&#13;
annually and would submit the audit reports to CPMO. The latter office would be&#13;
responsible for submnitting project consolidated accounts and consolidated audit reports to&#13;
the Bank Group. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that: (a) the Special Account&#13;
would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank Group, (b) the&#13;
provincial PMOs would maintain consolidated accounts for all components for annual&#13;
aaditing by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank Group, (c) audited accounts for&#13;
the entire project together with the auditor's report would be submitted to the Bank&#13;
Group within six months of the close of each calendar year, and (d) the seed companies&#13;
would have their financial statements audited by independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Bank Group.  The consolidated audit report would contain a summary of all the&#13;
provincial audit reports and audited accounts of MOA's project expenditures. It would&#13;
include details of withdrawals from the Credit/Loan accounts made on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditure and the auditor's opinion as to whether such withdrawals were&#13;
against expenditures eligible for reimbursement by IDA/IBRD.&#13;
K. LAND AcQUISITION&#13;
3.44  Land acquisition under the project by the 31 project seed companies would total&#13;
only about 39 ha, mainly commercial or unused land. They typically already own the&#13;
land designated for expansion or will contract with smallholder outgrowers to multiply&#13;
seeds on their own land. Out of 39 ha, only 1 ha is being farmed by three families. These&#13;
families would be allocated new farm land of equal quality and would get crop&#13;
coinpenisation according to applicable Chinese laws. They would not be relocated from&#13;
their houses. Details can be found in Annex 1, Table 9. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiationzs that, .if any of the subprojects would involve any resettlement, it has to be&#13;
carried out according to agreed principles and procedures and, if the numbers of&#13;
primary affected persons in ary subproject reach 200, the province concerned will submit&#13;
a resettlement action plan to the Bank Group for review as a condition of eligibility for&#13;
inclusion of the subproject in the project.&#13;
L. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS&#13;
3.45  The project was classified as a B category. It would not be expected to produce&#13;
any significant detrimental environmental impacts in the project areas.   Standard&#13;
environmental analysis for subprojects would be conducted by Provincial Environmental&#13;
Protection Bureaus (PEPBs), as needed, for new and existing facilities. The processing&#13;
plants have a limited potential for localized water, air and noise pollution within and&#13;
around the plant buildings, but procurement specifications for processing equipment&#13;
would maintain air emissions below the national thresholds for particulate matter, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
would include full environmental protection measures to maintain pollution within&#13;
national EPB standards. The project proposes to treat the effluent of all processing plants&#13;
and administrative and marketing buildings in septic tanks where necessary or, where&#13;
possible, to discharge effluent into municipal sewers. The combined effluent at the 31&#13;
project locations is estimated to be &lt; 1,000 m3/d with BOD concentration of 350-500&#13;
ppm.&#13;
3.46  The domestic heating system boilers and seed dryers will generate ash, and it has&#13;
been standard practice to use this ash in road construction and as an extender in brick&#13;
manufacture. The disposal of the negligible volumes of ash and clinker generated by&#13;
project activities should therefore not pose any problem. The cotton delinting plants&#13;
would use dilute acid foam delinting systems that were developed in the United States to&#13;
meet EPA standards. Similar plants have been used in China since the mid-1980s.&#13;
Concentrated acid is diluted for application to the cotton seeds and reacts with cellulose&#13;
linters to produce hydrolyzed cellulose, mainly sugars, that can be used as animal feed&#13;
enhancers. The residual acidity in the processed seed is neutralized in the process with an&#13;
alkali solution. It would be a condition of eligibility for inclusion in the project that each&#13;
subproject be in compliance with environmental standards acceptable to IDA and with&#13;
Chinese regulations.  Thus, the designs and equipment specifications of the seed&#13;
processing plants would be reviewed and approved by the relevant PEPB as part of its&#13;
environmental analysis and clearance of each facility. The PEPBs would monitor that&#13;
these processing plants maintain at all times the environmental protection standards.&#13;
3.47  The improvement and expansion of seed production under the project does not&#13;
differ from crop production for the same crops, except in terms of additional labor for&#13;
greater inspection and supervision. Similarly, since the seeds and planting materials&#13;
produced and distributed would be of crops already in production with variety or&#13;
genotype being the only change, the works of the project would not significantly change&#13;
interactions between crop agriculture and the environment.  -The fertilizers and&#13;
agricultural chemicals used in the production of seeds would be standard fertilizers,&#13;
pesticides, herbicides etc., as used in major agricultural economies for similar types of&#13;
seed production. All farm chemicals procured through the project would be ICAMA-&#13;
approved products. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations. Assistance&#13;
would also be required in bidding documents from chemical suppliers to provide training&#13;
of safe use, handling and storage in accordance with guidelines acceptable to the Bank&#13;
Group. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations. Optimal seed coatings&#13;
and coating systems would be determined during the project with the aid of foreign&#13;
technical assistance and would be ICAMA-approved products.  Seed treatment&#13;
technologies and chemicals (pesticides) would be the same as those used in the major&#13;
industrialized countries for the same kinds of seeds. Pesticides applied to seeds usually&#13;
substitute for pesticides applied in the furrow (i.e., soil) at the time of sowing or&#13;
sprayed/dusted on young plants, and are favored environmentally, since much less&#13;
pesticide is required and its placement on the seed ensures that it is positioned where it is&#13;
needed and not scattered in the soil or atmosphere.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
3.48   Germplasm Conservation and Genetic Diversity. China has been very diligent&#13;
since the 1950s in collecting and preserving the germplasm of its major crops. Over&#13;
200,000 accessions were assembled by 1958 after completion of a national campaign on&#13;
gerrpplasm collection begun in 1953. Some of these accessions were lost due to&#13;
inadequate and improper storage so that only 160,000 remained in 1979. A decision was&#13;
then taken to construct a proper gene bank in Beijing to be operated by the Germplasm&#13;
Resources Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS). The bank&#13;
was completed in 1983 and a second was begun with support from the Rockefeller&#13;
Toundation and other sources and completed in 1986. Presently, 350,000 accessions are&#13;
it, the central gene banks, which are world-class in terms of facilities and information&#13;
processing. An additional 25 field gene banks have been organized in various areas. As&#13;
en extra precaution the entire collection is duplicated in another gene bank in a "dry"&#13;
province. Additional specialized collections of germplasm, e.g., forest species, are under&#13;
control of other institutes and ministries. The germplasm collections in China admittedly&#13;
have an cconoinic bias. Recently, however, noneconomic and endangered species in the&#13;
et -system have received attention. In the fringe areas, when new improved varieties&#13;
replacc traditional varieties, there might be loss of biodiversity. Therefore the project&#13;
would encourage participating seed companies to assist germplasm resources institutes in&#13;
collecting existing species, so as to maintain biodiversity.&#13;
3.49  The genetic diversity in crop species in China is about the same as in other&#13;
countries with a high yield agriculture. The project will have a positive effect on the&#13;
genetic diversity of the crops involved in several ways. Firstly, commercialization of the&#13;
seeds sector will increase competition among the companies, which they will address in&#13;
large part by acquiring or developing proprietary varieties, i.e., varieties that are different&#13;
from others in the market in ways perceived to be important to farmers. The result will be&#13;
a more diverse array of varieties available to farmers. Secondly, liberalization of the crop&#13;
variety examination and registration requirements and procedures will facilitate the&#13;
importation of varieties from other countries, thus increasing the diversity of varieties.&#13;
Thirdly, enactment and implementation of a legal framework for the protection of plant&#13;
variety rights, as seems likely, will provide additional strong incentives for crop&#13;
improvement, research and development and make feasible the introduction of very&#13;
important germplasm and transgenetic products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION&#13;
4.1   Project organization would be quite complex, involving central and provincial&#13;
authorities. At the central level, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) would be responsible&#13;
for overall project implementation. MOA would assign responsibility to the Bureau of&#13;
State Farms (BSF) to oversee the implementation of activities concemned with state farm&#13;
seed companies and to the Department of Agriculture (DOA) for all other project&#13;
activities, including strengthening of DOA offices at the central level. Both the BSF and&#13;
the DOA would delegate responsibility for implementation of provincial-level activities&#13;
to participating provincial governments, which would deal directly with project seed&#13;
companies.&#13;
4.2   Project Leading Groups (PLGs). PLGs would be as small as possible to&#13;
maximize efficiency. The central PLG would be chaired by a Vice-Minister of MOA in&#13;
Beijing and the provincial PLGs by the Vice-Governors responsible for agriculture. The&#13;
members of the provincial PLGs would be the Directors of the Bureaus of Agriculture&#13;
(BOAs), the General Managers of the provincial-level BSF, the Directors of the&#13;
Provincial Academies of Agricultural Sciences, the Managers of the provincial-level&#13;
Agricultural Bank branches, and the Directors of the Bureaus of Finance. The two groups&#13;
would have representation from seed companies. PLGs at both levels would coordinate&#13;
and monitor implementation and resolve any disputes that may arise. They would have a&#13;
major role to play in the promotion, adoption and implementation of policies related to&#13;
the seed industry, and they would assume responsibility for ensuring provision of&#13;
adequate counterpart funds. At negotiations, an assurance was obtained that the PLGs&#13;
would be maintained with terms of reference, composition and resources acceptable to&#13;
the Bank Group.&#13;
4.3   Project Management Offices. Project management offices would be set up at&#13;
MOA and in participating provinces to coordinate project implementation. The Central&#13;
Project Management Office (CPMO) would be staffed with personnel from the DOA and&#13;
the BSF. It would: (a) assist the Provincial Project Management Offices (PPMOs) in&#13;
drawing up implementation schedules, (b) coordinate project activities with the line&#13;
agencies at the national and provincial levels, (c) arrange for combined procurement&#13;
under ICB or LIB, (d) coordinate overseas training, study tours and technical assistance,&#13;
(e) assist the PPMOs in withdrawing funds from the Credit/Loan, (f) ensure that&#13;
consolidated accounts, audits and progress reports are prepared and submitted to the Bank&#13;
Group on time, (g) undertake project monitoring, evaluation and supervision (para. 4.13),&#13;
and (h) arrange for the project launch workshop (para. 4.1 1), a mid-term evaluation of the&#13;
project and a completion report after the project completion (para. 4.13).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
4.4   PPMOs would be staffed with trained and qualified personnel from both the&#13;
provincial BOAs and BSFs. The PPMOs would assist the seed enterprises in liaison with&#13;
provincial and central authorities regarding assistance needed to facilitate project&#13;
implementation. They would also coordinate project works with the CPMO. Assurance&#13;
was obtained at negotiations that the borrower would maintain and support the CPMO&#13;
and the PPMOs with terms of reference, composition and resources acceptable to the&#13;
Bank Group.&#13;
4.5  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) would be responsible for the financial&#13;
management of the project and the maintenance of consolidated financial accounts. In&#13;
order to ensure the effective implementation of the project, and confirm the terms and&#13;
conditions of relending of Loan/Credit proceeds, assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that the Borrower would enter into Project Implementation Arrangements&#13;
(PIAs) with each project province. Conclusion of at least nine PIAs satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank Group would be a condition of loan/credit effectiveness.&#13;
B. PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.6   The CPMO would assist the project provinces in liaison with design institutions&#13;
on the designs and technical specifications where identical facilities or processes are to be&#13;
p.ovided for several seed enterprises. These would include the design and specification&#13;
of standard seed enterprise administrative buildings, standard seed stores and standard&#13;
processing buildings. The CPMO would also be responsible for engaging technical&#13;
assistance to review the designs, flow charts, layouts and technical specifications of the&#13;
seed processing lines. The TOR for this technical assistance can be found in Annexi.&#13;
4.7   Seed company managements would have autonomous responsibility for managing&#13;
the seed companies, including the state farm seed companies, as the enterprises would be&#13;
established as limited liability companies or limited liability stock companies under the&#13;
Chinese Company Law. A condition of eligibility to receive a subloan would be that&#13;
enterprises would have been established in accordance with this law, that they have&#13;
established a suitable benefits system for employees, and that they be creditworthy, have&#13;
a soundfinancial structure and suitable organization and management.&#13;
4.8   Some companies, notably state farm zompanies, would produce their own breeder&#13;
seeds or parent-line seeds. Some state farm companies own and operate the farms&#13;
producing commercial seed. For most project companies, however, the production of&#13;
seed would normally be undertaken as at present by individuals contracted under the&#13;
household responsibility system. Under the project, seed growing would however be&#13;
closely supervised by technical staff from the seed companies, who would provide&#13;
extension advice. The companies would supply production inputs on credit to those&#13;
farmers unable to purchase inputs from the township agroextension centers.  The&#13;
companies would supply foundation or mother seed, together with fertilizer and&#13;
chemicals not generally available in many counties. Fields would not be subject to&#13;
routine inspection for certification, but sample fields would be inspected by staff of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
seed companies to monitor physical and genetic purity. Competent technicians would&#13;
also be responsible for sampling and testing all batches of seed before packing to ensure&#13;
that the technical description on the seed label is accurate.&#13;
4.9   Management of the new independent external quality control agencies will be the&#13;
responsibility cf the provincial agriculture bureaus. The present seed station staffs will&#13;
form the core staffs of these new units. The heads of the units will report to the heads of&#13;
the agriculture bureaus and not to seed companies.  Assurance was obtained at&#13;
negotiations that each project province would introduce, no later than December 31,&#13;
1996, a program of random field crop inspection and testing ofpacked seed In the event&#13;
that a field does not meet the necessary standards of uniformity they would have the&#13;
responsibility to prevent use of the crop for seed purposes. In the event that a sample of&#13;
seed failed routine tests they would immediately carry out tests on all packs from the&#13;
batch and if a sufficient number of samples failed to meet the necessary standards they&#13;
wgould prohibit sale of seed from the batch. They would also carry out tests on behalf of&#13;
farmers or groups of farmers in the event that seed fails to meet the specifications on its&#13;
p ick label. The results of these tests would be used by the farmers in pressing their case&#13;
for zompensation .-om tiie seed company.&#13;
C. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.1   MOF v. uid allocate the IBRD Loan and IDA Credit to the Provincial Bureaus of&#13;
Finance .o be onlent to the seed companies.  The interest rate from MOF to the&#13;
participating provinces would be 5.5 percent with a repayment period of 20 years,&#13;
inclusive of 5 years grace period. The participating provinces would onlend funds to&#13;
eligible seed cornpanies at an interest rate of at least 6.5 percent, with a maturity of up to&#13;
20 years, including 5 years of grace; the enterprise would bear foreign exchange risk&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations to this effect.&#13;
D. PROJECT LAUNCH WORKSHOP&#13;
4.11  The project is complex and involves the introduction of radically new approaches&#13;
to doing business whereby seed companies would become financially independent units&#13;
rather than line agencies of government supplying subsidized seed to farmers. To&#13;
familiarize staff of the seed companies, BOAs, BSFs and PMOs with the project&#13;
concepts, staff of the Bank Group and local experts would conduct project launch&#13;
workshops, during the first six months after project approval, in selected provincial&#13;
capitals. The purpose of the workshops would be to: (a) train staff in the commercial&#13;
operations of seed businesses, (b) clarify the individual tasks and responsibilities of all&#13;
staff involved in the project, (c) review seed company implementation plans, and&#13;
(d) clarify the operational and reporting procedures of the Bank Group.&#13;
E. TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
4.12  The training program for the project is shown in Annex 9. Each year, the CPMO&#13;
would submit a detailed plan to the Bank Group for review before the end of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
preceding year. Overseas training and study tours would have to be detailed with&#13;
objectives, place, time and participants. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that&#13;
annual overseas training and study tour plans would be submitted to the Bank Group by&#13;
October 31 of the preceding year for prior approval and all consultants would be hired&#13;
in accordance with IBRD 's guidelines on the selection and use of consultants.&#13;
F. SUPERVISION, MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REPORTING&#13;
4.13  The project management at the central and provincial levels would monitor&#13;
project progress. In order to ensure smooth implementation, the CPMO would establish&#13;
procedures for project supervision. Regular supervision would be carried out to assess&#13;
the physical, technical and financial aspects of the project. Details of the supervision plan&#13;
are described in Annex 10. Each seed company has its own implementation plan and&#13;
progress would be evaluated against that plan.  Monitoring indicators, including&#13;
performance indicators, were established and would be used to evaluate progress under&#13;
the project. These are (a) completion of the draft seed and plant variety legislation;&#13;
(b) accession to UPOV and ISTA; (c) development of external quality control offices in&#13;
the project provinces; (d) successful establishment of seed companies as autonomous&#13;
commercial entities; and (e) formation of these seed companies of alliances with seed&#13;
companies in other provinces and countries. The CPMO would assist the PPMOs to&#13;
evaluate the impact of the project on agricultural production, farm incomes and selected&#13;
environmental parameters (details in Annex 7). Progress reports would be produced by&#13;
all PPMOs, summarized by the CPMO and forwarded to the Bank Group every six&#13;
nonths, by September I of each year for the preceding January-June, and by March I for&#13;
the preceding July-December. A mid-term review of the project would be undertaken by&#13;
the CPMO by June 30, 1998 to assess progress according to the key performance&#13;
indicators, and chart implementation of the project for the remaining period. The CPMO&#13;
would make a broad assessment of the project's implementation in a draft project&#13;
completion report to be submitted to the Bank Group no later than six months following&#13;
the completion of the Credit/Loan disbursement. Assurances regarding the preparation&#13;
and timing of progress and completion reports and mid-term review were obtained at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
5. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND PRICES&#13;
A. PRODUCTION&#13;
5.1   Incremental Seed Production. The project would result in about 272,600 tons&#13;
of increased seed production annually at full production (Annex.S, Table 1). The&#13;
additional seed would likely include 210,997 tons of major grains (hybrid and&#13;
conventional rice, wheat, hybrid maize and barley), 22,400 tons of oilseeds (rapeseed,&#13;
peanuts, and soybeans), 39,200 tons of cash crops (cotton, vegetables, melons and other&#13;
crops), and 480,000 seedlings (fruit and flowers). Among the grains, hybrid maize seed&#13;
would entail the largest increment (64,000 tons). Wheat seed, just behind hybrid maize,&#13;
would increase by 46,700 tons. Hybrid rice seed would increase by 48,500 tons, while&#13;
conventional rice seed would increase by 32,700 tons. Increments of cash crops would be&#13;
led by cotton seed (35,000 tons) and those of oilseeds by hybrid rapeseed (2,700 tons),&#13;
peanuts (9,700 tons) and soybean (9,900 tons). Vegetable and melon seeds in eight&#13;
provinces would increase by 4,200 tons. Barley seed would be increased by 18,600 tons.&#13;
Other seeds (kenaf, grass seeds, herb seeds and sugar beet seeds) would be increased by&#13;
4,430 tons.&#13;
5.2  Incremental Product. The main objective of the project is to increase product&#13;
yield through improved seed quality, including that of existing seed production. The&#13;
incremental product would be derived from a combination of an increase in overall crop&#13;
yields due to greater varietal purity and reduced seed requirements due to higher&#13;
germination rates. Commercially purchased seed would replace the seed previously&#13;
retained for seed by farmers from their own production, thus freeing up this quantity for&#13;
consumpticn or sale.  The incremental volume of improved seed would replace&#13;
unimproved or retained seed on about 6.3 million ha, including 1.6 million ha of hybrid&#13;
rice, 0.2 miilion ha of conventional rice, 0.3 million ha of wheat, 1.4 million ha of hybrid&#13;
maize, 0.3 million ha of rapeseeds, 0.7 million ha of cotton seeds, .05 million ha of&#13;
peanuts, 0.13 million ha of soybean and 1.4 million ha of vegetables. Incremental crop&#13;
production due to the project is expected to be 10.9 million tons (3.2 and 7.6 million tons&#13;
for grains and other crops, respectively). Detailed incremental yield and production can&#13;
be found in Annex 5, Tables 1-3.&#13;
B. MARKETS&#13;
5.3   Overall the marketing of improved seed is not expected to present major&#13;
difficulties. Restrictions on marketing previously imposed on the seed market, especially&#13;
on intercounty and interregional trade, would be removed under the policy reforms&#13;
introduced under the project. In 1994, the formal seed sector provided only 3.5 million&#13;
tons of seed, which was only 25 percent of the national seed requirement of 12.5 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
tons. The inciernental volume of seed and seedlings to be produced would be substantial,&#13;
but in the context of total demand within China, it would be only 1.5 percent of the total&#13;
demand for seeds. Most currently traded seed is of poor quality and is not expected to&#13;
present much competition. Grain seed other than hybrids is primarily marketed locally.&#13;
Vegetable seeds, especially specialty varieties, such as the Chinese cabbage seed of Zibo&#13;
County, are marketed in considerable amounts outside the region of production, with&#13;
prefessional traders taking an active distribution role. Cash-crop seed marketing varies&#13;
with the varieties, some, e.g., cotton, only being supplied locally and others being sold to&#13;
seed companies in other provinces.&#13;
5.4   Locally, some marketing problems may arise.  No seed companies have&#13;
undertaken any formal market research, and only a few have established marketing&#13;
arrangements with seed companies in other provinces. Almost certainly some project&#13;
companies will experience difficulties in building up their local market share and will&#13;
face unanticipated competition from other suppliers in the interprovincial market. As part&#13;
of their business development plan (para. 2.40), all seed companies have to develop&#13;
marketing strategies. Some have already started the marketing process and obtained&#13;
purchase commitments from seed companies in other provinces. One particular area of&#13;
opportunity is to sell to provinces with no local sources of high-quality seed of the&#13;
particular varieties involved but which have not imported seed in the past.&#13;
5.5   Domestic Demand. Demand for high quality seed has been growing rapidly,&#13;
reflecting increased product demand due to population and income growth and farmers&#13;
switching to imp,oved seed. The government policy of ensuring food supply and&#13;
maintaining per capita grain production of 450 kg per capita has put pressure on&#13;
increasing agricultural productivity, which can only be achieved through better seeds.&#13;
S.C   Corn is a prime example of this policy. At present, 75 percent of the corn area&#13;
already uses hybrid corn seed and must purchase seed every year. The government's&#13;
target is to increase usage to 95 percent, which would increase demand by 19 percent.&#13;
The higher quality seed produced under the project would find a ready market, since the&#13;
incremental production of 65,000 tons under the project would only be 17 percent of total&#13;
requirements.&#13;
5.7   Domestic demand for hybrid rice declined during the last few years, but has&#13;
started to pick up again this year. The decline was due to the low quality of many&#13;
varieties of hybrid rice seed, and the more discriminating purchases of higher income&#13;
consumers. The pick up is due to the improved hybrid varieties now available, including&#13;
hybrid glutinous rice, which is in high demand in the northern provinces. In general,&#13;
there is considerable room to improve hybrid rice seed to achieve higher yield, resistance&#13;
to disease and better product flavor.  With increased commercialization, the seed&#13;
enterprises under the project would need to take account of particular regional demands&#13;
for various hybrid varieties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
5.8    The government is also promoting the use of hybrid rice seeds and has targeted an&#13;
increase in the area under hybrid rice from 45 percent to 70 percent. The incremental&#13;
high quality hybrid rice seed under the project would only be 12 percent of the total&#13;
incremental demand for hybrid rice and marketing problems are not expected.&#13;
5.9   The demand for high quality conventional cereal seeds (rice, wheat) is expected to&#13;
be significantly increased due to the desire to increase yields. Most seed for conventional&#13;
varieties is produced by farm households for self-use, but this practice entails declining&#13;
yields as varietal purity degenerates. Farmers then purchase seed to replace their retained&#13;
seed with pure varieties and restart the cycle. Progressive farmers, now typically on a&#13;
three-year cycle are moving to a two-year cycle, and the average farmers are also&#13;
decreasing their seed replacement period.&#13;
5.10   The demand for high quality cotton seed is also expected to increase. This is due&#13;
to the greater profitability under the new higher cotton price and higher demand for&#13;
cotton lint from the textile industry. Very poor germination rates of cotton seed due to&#13;
poor seed quality is a factor in the current high seeding rates which resulted in the&#13;
shortage of cotton seed.  Farmers typically save their own seeds, but with higher&#13;
purchasing prices, better seed produces better returns and provides the incentive to invest&#13;
more in seeds. Germination of cotton seed would be improved with the acid delinting&#13;
seed produced under the project.&#13;
5.11   Vegetable production has increased substantially during the last few years due to&#13;
high market demand and prices. Vegetables are the only crop category that can be traded&#13;
freely in both crop and seed. Hybrid vegetable seed is immensely superior to retained&#13;
seed of local varieties, and demand for the hybrids is growing rapidly. In 1994, 1.2&#13;
million tons of vegetable seeds were sold for the growing area of 4.5 million ha of&#13;
vegetables. The demand for seed is expected to increase rapidly, due to an increase in the&#13;
area under cultivation, especially around cities, and an increase in investment in&#13;
greenhouse production.&#13;
5.12  Interpirovincial Trade. Theoretically, restrictions on interprovincial trade in&#13;
seed have beeii removed. However, a national seed market has not yet formed, and local&#13;
protection still. exists in some areas. Clear seed policy statements by the government&#13;
would be required to end such practices and facilitate interprovincial trade. Currently&#13;
interprovincial trade, or so-called "varietal exchange", continues to be largely on barter&#13;
terms arnong long-term clients, and seed companies lack information about market&#13;
demand and supply. Vegetable seed is an exception, in which interprovincial trade is&#13;
quite active and market information is obtained from an annual seed fair in Wuhan,&#13;
Hubei, in which more than 5,000 vegetable producers and traders participate. Factors&#13;
limiting the clevelopment of interprovincial trade in grain seed include inadequate&#13;
transportation and an administrative requirement of three years' testing by seed&#13;
companies befDre new varieties of grain seed can be introduced into a region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
5.13   All participating seed companies have proposed to increase their sales to&#13;
interprovincial markets, and when the new seed policies are fully implemented it is&#13;
expected that trends will be similar to those in the vegetable market. On average, 30-40&#13;
percent of the incremental production under the project would be sold to interprovincial&#13;
and international markets.&#13;
5.14   Export Market. Until recently, Chinese seed exports have been very limited and&#13;
are still small. The most extensive development has been in the vegetable seed trade&#13;
through the agency of joint ventures with intemational businesses, and exports of&#13;
vegetable seed are now significant. Chinese vegetable seed producers have become&#13;
members of the International Federation for Seed Trade (FIS).&#13;
5.15   Several factors have inhibited the development of other seed exports. China's&#13;
previous disinclination to join intemational seed organizations or meet intemational&#13;
export standards is one. For instance, grain seed exports have not become significant,&#13;
because China has not met the standards of the OECD Scheme for Seed Certification.&#13;
However, border trade with Viet Nam and Korea is active in border provinces such as&#13;
Guangxi and Liaoning. China's delay in joining the Intemational Union for the&#13;
Protection of Plant Varieties (UPOV) has also inhibited the import of germplasm for&#13;
production and export. A second factor inhibiting exports in the past has been the seed&#13;
trade monopoly of the China National Seed Corporation (CNSC). This monopoly has&#13;
now been abolished, and all seed enterprises are free to develop intemational business.&#13;
The project would encourage project seed companies to enter the intemational market.&#13;
5.16  Joint Ventures. Although there are very few joint venture seed companies in&#13;
China at present, the initial ventures in vegetable seed have shown the profitability of&#13;
international trade. A major deterrent to joint ventures has been the absence of plant&#13;
breeder's rights. The Chinese government is now focusing its attention on this issue,&#13;
which is closely related to other aspects of property rights reform. Many of the project&#13;
seed companies have expressed interest in establishing joint venture companies and&#13;
producing and marketing proprietary germplasm from foreign breeders. A number of&#13;
international seed companies are also interested in improved Chinese germplasm and&#13;
willing to negotiate with potential Chinese partners.&#13;
C. PRICES&#13;
5.1 7 Grain Prices. A three-tier system of prices still applies in grain marketing:&#13;
administered or "quota" prices for the portion of the crop that each farmer must deliver to&#13;
the State (in effect a form of taxation or rent payable for the use of the farmland),&#13;
"negotiated" prices, which apply to the part of the crop that the Government buys from&#13;
farmers over and above the quota, and free market prices. Administered prices have been&#13;
periodically adjusted in response to inflation, following a sharp increase in free market&#13;
prices in the preceding year (see Annex 5, Table 6). This led to increases in average&#13;
producer prices from 1993 to 1994: for rice (in eight selected provinces) 91 percent, for&#13;
wheat (seven provinces) 65 percent, and for corn (six provinces) 35 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
5.18  Seed Prices. The price of seeds of basic grains in the past has been set in&#13;
accordance with rigid central government rules, the price paid to growers being linked by&#13;
fixed ratios to commercial grain prices, which allowed the seed companies a minimal&#13;
markup. The ratios have in fact served more as guidance than as rules, and- in practice&#13;
actual markups have been determined by policy decisions at various national and&#13;
provincial levels, with the result that seed prices differ substantially from one province to&#13;
another. In general, the prices of processed grain seed (but not that of other crops) have&#13;
been too low to enable profitable processing. At present, although the market has been&#13;
liberalized and seed companies have the authority to adjust prices without administrative&#13;
permission, some governments continue to control seed marketing and prices. An&#13;
understanding was obtained at negotiations that the Government would continue to relax&#13;
price control and that seed companies under the project would be allowed to pursue&#13;
competitive and market-oriented pricing strategies.&#13;
5.19 Hybrid Seeds. The ratio of the price of hybrid seed to commercial grain is much&#13;
higher than that of conventional seed, reflecting the higher production cost. In normal&#13;
years, for hybrid rice, the ratio has been 6-8:1, whereas for hybrid corn, it has been 34:1.&#13;
However, when the demand for seed has been high, the ratio has jumped to 10 or more to&#13;
one. In 1994, the price of hybrid rice seed varied between 12-17 Yuan per kg in different&#13;
provinces.&#13;
5.20  Conventional Seeds. The price ratio for conventional seeds (conventional rice&#13;
and wheat) has been 1.2-1.5:1. The price ratios of other kinds of seeds, like peanuts,&#13;
cotton seed, soybean and rapeseed have also fallen in this administrative category.&#13;
5.21  Vegetable Seeds. The prices of vegetable seed are free to vary according to&#13;
rmarket supply anid demand. Prices vary from Yuan 400/kg for sweet pepper seed to Yuan&#13;
8/Kg for garlic seeds. Other vegetable prices are listed in Annex 5, Table 7.&#13;
D. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
5.22  Financial analysis has been carried out for all selected seed companies. Costs and&#13;
benefits are derived from the individual business development plans, and are based on the&#13;
inciZmental costs and benefits of the preproject existing companies.  Costs were&#13;
separated into investment and operating costs. Investrnent costs include those of land&#13;
development, building construction, equipment, materials and incremental working&#13;
capital. Unit costs are based on the prevailing domestic prices for locally procured items&#13;
and international prices for imported items, with all costs updated to 1995 values. Unit&#13;
costs also include import duties and value added tax (VAT) on all ICB procured materials&#13;
and equipment. Locally procured items attract VAT only. Tax and duties amount to&#13;
approximately 24 percent of capital investment cost. Physical contingencies are included&#13;
as part of investment cost. Working capital estimates are based on requirements for&#13;
unprocessed seed storage, consumable materials in stock, work in progress (including&#13;
field crop production where relevant), processed and packed production in stock, and&#13;
accounts payable for one month including water, power, fuel, salaries and insurance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
5.23  Operating costs included fixed and variable operating costs, including charges on&#13;
borrowed working capital. Fixed operating costs include social and welfare bonuses&#13;
estimated at 11 percent of staff salaries, overhead at 2.5 percent of full production&#13;
turnover, insurance at 1.5 percent of capital investment and marketing costs at 3 percent&#13;
ef full production turnover. Annual maintenance cost is included at 2 percent of building&#13;
costs, 10 percent of vehicle costs and 3 percent of equipment costs.&#13;
5.24  Incremental benefits calculated for financial analysis are based on the price&#13;
differentials the companies receive from producing high quality seed. The margin&#13;
between the wholesale price of seed and the price that a company paid to contract farmers&#13;
is considered revenue to the company. An example of the financial analysis of a&#13;
participating seed company can been found in Annex 5, Table 9.&#13;
5.25 Financial Rate of Return (FRR). FRR was calculated, based on the above cost&#13;
and benefit assumptions for all seed companies. The FRRs ranged from 20 percent to 30&#13;
percent. The overall FRR of all subcomponents is estimated at 27 percent. A summary&#13;
of FRRs for all participating companies can be found in Annex 5, Table 8. Each&#13;
company has to produce a FRR of at least 20 percent at full operating capacity in order to&#13;
cover taxes and debt service payments and to allow growth in retained earnings of the&#13;
organization. Having a FRR of at least 20 percent was also a criterion for qualification as&#13;
a participating subproject.&#13;
5.26 Sensitivity Analysis. Sensitivity analysis was carried out for all seed enterprises&#13;
to establish the effect on FRR of changes in major variables, such as prices, investment&#13;
costs and operating costs. These variables were also tested against changes in production&#13;
volume varying from full capacity of 100 percent down to 80 percent The results of the&#13;
analysis show that all the FRRs are not very sensitive to changes in prices, costs and&#13;
production. (Details can be found in Annex 5, Table 8.)&#13;

6. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
6.1   The major benefits of this project would be threefold. At the sector level, an&#13;
environment conducive to commercial development would be developed through policy&#13;
and regulatory reforms. At the enterprise level, a core group of seed companies would&#13;
learn to develop profitable commercial business in response to domestic and international&#13;
commercial demand. At the farm level, there would be an improvement in farm&#13;
production, yield and incomes.&#13;
6.2   The reforms in seed policy would vitalize the seed sector in several ways. First,&#13;
they would facilitate the elimination of the present monopoly-ridden commercial&#13;
environment by promoting intercounty and interprovincial trade.   Second, by&#13;
streamlining the examination and registration system and authorizing seed production&#13;
outside breeding areas, they would facilitate commercial activity by expediting the&#13;
movement of new cultivars into commerce. Third, as a result of the introduction of&#13;
improved quality control procedures, they would make a major contribution to the overall&#13;
improvemenit in the standards and quality of agricultural seed produced and sold in&#13;
China. Fourth, the development and implementation of a legal framework for the&#13;
protection of plant breeder rights wouid stimulate plant breeding activities within the&#13;
country since ownership of new cultivars would be possible and institutes could set&#13;
reasonable prices for new products.&#13;
6.3   Fifth, the inflow of foreign germplasm to China would increase due to domestic&#13;
companies seeking new and improved genetic materials from abroad and foreign firms&#13;
seeking more business ventures, knowing that their property rights would be protected.&#13;
Domestic seed enterprises would also seek cooperation with international seed breeders&#13;
to combine the improved Chinese varieties with the improved foreign germplasm.&#13;
Through the broadening of the germplasm base and the establishment of research&#13;
cooperation vith foreign companies, seed companies with integrated research, production&#13;
and marketing functions would probably develop as they exist in most western countries.&#13;
6.4   Participating companies would have a chance to develop into profitable,&#13;
independent companies with clearly defined structures and ownership. The companies&#13;
would be managed by trained management teams with responsibility for planning,&#13;
production and marketing. Due to their profitability, the companies would be able to pay&#13;
taxes and retain cash flow for future expansion. The transparency of structure, ownership&#13;
and management would facilitate the flow of foreign capital into joint ventures to produce&#13;
seeds for export. International companies would also be expected to significantly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
increase their presence in the Chinese market through variety licensing, variety&#13;
registration and breeding cooperation.&#13;
6.5   The major quantifiable benefits from the project would be in the area of&#13;
incremental production resulting from the improved quality of seeds. The introduction of&#13;
new germplasm would lead to further yield increases of crops such as hybrid rice and&#13;
corn. The latter could increase by 10-20 percent, based on yields currently achieved in&#13;
China compared with those of France and the United States. In addition, good quality&#13;
seed would reduce the existing excess seeding rates. For instance, farmers would save&#13;
about 90 kg/ha when hybrid rice seed is used instead of conventional rice and would save&#13;
5 kg/ha when improved hybrid rice seed is used instead of ordinary hybrid rice. Acid&#13;
delinted cotton seed would save about 15 kg/ha of cotton seed. Improved varieties of&#13;
wheat would reduce the seeding rate by 30 kg/ha, and improved corn would reduce the&#13;
seeding :ate by 5 kg/ha. In total, the saving from using improved hybrid seed would be&#13;
about Y 126 million ($15 million) per year for the project area.&#13;
6.6   The total incremental production would be 3.2 million tons of grains (rice, wheat,&#13;
corn, and barley), 316,000 tons of oil crops (rapeseed, peanuts and soybean), 280,000&#13;
tons of cotton and 7 million tons of vegetables. Total seed saved is estimated at 49,000&#13;
tons. The annual financial value of incremental production would be Y 10.0 billion ($1.2&#13;
billion), while the annual economic value would be Y 14.6 billion ($1.7 billion) based on&#13;
economic prices (Annex 5, Table 1). The net economic value would be Y 7.8 billion&#13;
($0.98 billion) (Annex 6, Table 8.2).&#13;
B. EMPLOYMENT AND INCOMES&#13;
6.7   At the farm level, the demand for labor for planting would be reduced due to less&#13;
seed being used. However, the demand for labor would be increased in the areas of crop&#13;
maintenance and harvesting due to higher yields. The incremental demand for labor is&#13;
assumed to be met from household laborers. Additional employment may be created for&#13;
harvesting and post harvesting activities. The seed companies would provide 1,360 new&#13;
jobs in the seed processing industry in 31 modernized seed processing plants, and I seed&#13;
machinery plant.&#13;
6.9   The project would have a positive impact on the incomes of project beneficiaries.&#13;
Farm budget analysis indicates that net income would be increased due to better yield and&#13;
production. For example, in Guangxi, the net farm income per hectare of hybrid rice&#13;
would be increased from Y 4,51b ($538) to Y 5,437 ($647), from Y 1,870 ($223) to&#13;
Y 3,073 ($365) for hybrid com and from Y 3,759 ($448) to Y 7,268 ($865) for peanuts.&#13;
Farm budget analysis for each province is summarized in Annex 6, Table 1. Farm model&#13;
analysis shows that per capita income of farmers in Guangxi would be increased from&#13;
Y 414 ($49) to Y 640 ($76) with the project, an increment of Y 226 ($27) or 35 percent.&#13;
The average per capita income of the project's farmers as a whole would be increased&#13;
from Y 580 ($69) to Y 905 ($108), an increment of Y 325 ($39) or 56 percent. Results of&#13;
farm model analysis by province are summarized in Annex 6, Table 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52-&#13;
C. COST RECOVERY&#13;
6.9   Cost recovery for this project would come from service fees and tax revenue from&#13;
the seed companies and incremental crop production. Fees would be established for seed&#13;
registration, certification and testing services. Assurance was obtained at negotiations&#13;
that the Borrower would develop, no later than December 31, 1997, a fee system for&#13;
variety testing and registration, field inspection and seed testing to cover the cost of these&#13;
services. Such system would be introduced no later than June 30, 1998 in at least six&#13;
Project Provinces, with a view to introducing such systems nationwide no later than&#13;
June 30, 2000. A draft of the proposal would be reviewed at the project launch&#13;
workshop. The cost of external quality control, research and extension would be&#13;
recovered through the 5 percent provincial crop tax which would be imposed on the&#13;
incremental crop production under the project.&#13;
6.10 The government would receive incremental tax revenue from the VAT and the&#13;
corporation tax levy by the central government and City Construction Tax levied locally.&#13;
The companies would generate total annual tax revenue of Y 280 million of which Y 110&#13;
million would be VAT, Y 160 million corporation tax and Y 10 million city tax. The&#13;
seed companies would be responsible for repaying the principal plus interest on their&#13;
borrowings. Repayments to MOF would be guaranteed by all participating project&#13;
provinces.&#13;
D. IMPACT ON GOVERNMENT BUDGET&#13;
6.11  The total incremental recurrent budget required to keep the project seed stations&#13;
operating at the same level of efficiency following the loan disbursement period is&#13;
estimated at Y 6.5 million ($0.8 million). The percentage impact of this incremental&#13;
recurrent expenditure on the administrative budgets of the 13 provinces is very small.&#13;
E. ECONOMIc ANALYSIS&#13;
6.12  Economic analysis has been carried out for each province and for the project as a&#13;
whole. As described in paras. 6.5-6.6, the economic benefits of the project would come&#13;
from: (a) the net value of incremental grain production resulting from better varieties of&#13;
seed, and (b) the saving of seed from the use of higher quality seed at recommended&#13;
seeding rates.  The incremental economic benefit is estimated from per hectare&#13;
incremental production based on farm budget analysis of the future situation with and&#13;
without the project, using economic prices for inputs and outputs (Annex.6, Table 7).&#13;
The net economic value of annual potential incremental production would be&#13;
Y 7.8 billion per annum, on the assumption that 100 percent of the farmers using&#13;
improved seeds in the project area would achieve the expected incremental yield.&#13;
6.13  The total hectarage for each crop in each province is estimated on the basis of&#13;
incremental seed production under the project. The incremental economic values by&#13;
province are shown in An= 6, Table 8. Project costs include all project investment&#13;
costs for seed companies and seed stations (excluding the MOA project office and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
Shanghai Xiangmin Machinery Company) and the fixed and variable operating costs of&#13;
the seed companies, the incremental recurrent cost of the seed stations, the incremental&#13;
farm production costs and an allowance for physical contingencies. Buildings are&#13;
assumed to last 20 years and vehicles and equipment 7-8 years. Recurrent costs are&#13;
assumed to continue at the same level for the remainder of the 20-year period as during&#13;
project Year 6.&#13;
6.14  World price projections or average export prices actually realized by China in&#13;
1995 were used to estimate constant farm-gate economic prices for traded inputs and&#13;
outputs (Aanex 6, Table 5). Economic prices for nontraded goods were estimated using&#13;
conversion factors (Annex 6, Table 6) based on the analysis of the deviations of social&#13;
opportunity costs from the actual financial prices prevailing in China, which are caused&#13;
by taxes and price distortions. All economic values were converted to local currency at&#13;
the prevailing official exchange rate of Y 8.4 to $1.&#13;
6.15  A conservative approach was made in claiming the benefits of the project. In&#13;
general, a concentrated area development effort would be needed to realize the full&#13;
benefits of an agricultural project. Since seed production under the project would be used&#13;
in extensive areas, it is unlikely that the full incremental benefit would be totally achieved&#13;
without such efforts. For instance, farmers may not have access to the inputs or support&#13;
services that would be necessary to fully exploit the benefit of improved seeds.&#13;
Furthermore, it is difficult to disaggregate the result of improved seeds from that of&#13;
improved irrigation, input supply, marketing and credit. Hence, for this economic&#13;
analysis, benefits attributed to improved seed are assumed to be only 25 percent of the net&#13;
potential incremental value of production. Based on the above, the economic rates of&#13;
return of investment in each province range from 18 percent to 77 percent. The project's&#13;
economic rate of return is estimated at 42 percent, with a net present value of Y 1.7&#13;
billion ($205 million). A summary of the analysis can be found in Annex 6, Table 9.&#13;
6.16  Sensitivity analysis has been carried out to evaluate the sensitivity of the&#13;
project's ERR to price and cost variations. The project is not very sensitive to an increase&#13;
in investment and operating costs; if the investment costs increased by 10 percent, the&#13;
ERR would be reduced to 39 percent, and if the operating cost increased by 10 percent,&#13;
ERR would be reduced to 30 percent. Labor cost has a very small impact on the ERR; 10&#13;
percent and 20 percent increases in labor costs would reduce ERR to 41 percent and 40&#13;
percent, respectively. However, the ERR is sensitive to prices of output: if price falls by&#13;
10 percent, ERR would be reduced to 24 percent.&#13;
6.17  Sensitivity analysis has also been carried out to identify the minimum incremental&#13;
value of production due to seeds that would still result in a satisfactory ERR. Usage&#13;
would have to drop to a very low 20 percent of farmers to bring the ERR down to 12&#13;
percent, the opportunity cost of capital. If 30 percent of farmers achieved the expected&#13;
yields, the ERR would increase to 74 percent. A summary of the sensitivity analysis can&#13;
be found in Annex 6, Tables 10-16.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
F. RisKs&#13;
6.18  A risk with respect to the policy framework would be that not all of the measures&#13;
under the draft seed sector policy would be approved by the Government. This is&#13;
lessened by the open reiteration of this policy in several high-level speeches and the&#13;
initiation of several key activities to achieve this policy by the Government. Seed sector&#13;
modernization and commercialization is also the main thrust in the new government's&#13;
Seed Industrialization Program. In the project, seed companies are being restructured to&#13;
be independent companies under the Chinese Company Law. Policy actions to separate&#13;
seed administration from seed commercialization have already been achieved in more&#13;
than 10 provinces. The new seed law and a legal framework for plant variety protection&#13;
is being drafted. And, finally, the price of seed is now set according to market conditions,&#13;
and interprovincial trade for seed has become significant.&#13;
6.19  A risk with respect to the legal framework would be a significant delay in&#13;
enacting the seed law and the legal framework for plant variety protection. This is&#13;
lessened by the strong government commitment to seed commercialization and the desire&#13;
to enter the international seed trade. The first drafts of the seed law and the legal&#13;
framework for plant variety protection are being refined and are expected to be submitted&#13;
to the State Council by the end of this year. The risk of poor regulatory follow-through in&#13;
implementing the law and regulation is lessened by the involvement of provincial&#13;
governments in the drafting and the government's plan to draft implementing particulars.&#13;
6.20  The risk that no effective, profitable seed companies will emerge or they will&#13;
decline to compete outside of traditional boundaries is reduced by the selection process&#13;
already undertaken. It would be further reduced by the improved business environment&#13;
and by technical assistance to firms in business practice and management. The risk of&#13;
ineffective financial management would be minimized by training and institutional&#13;
development financed under the project. The risk of nonavailability of new superior&#13;
products would be minimized by the ability to access new genetic materials via&#13;
international trade. Production risk is very small since seed has been produced for&#13;
several millennia in China.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

7. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1   At negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that:&#13;
(a)   The participating provinces would onlend funds to eligible seed companies&#13;
at an interest rate of at least 6.5 percent, with a maturity of 20 years,&#13;
including 5 years' grace; the enterprise would bear the foreign exchange&#13;
risk. Subloans would only be made to enterprises and to subprojects that&#13;
meet the agreed eligibility criteria (paras. 2.41, 3.44, 3.47, 4.7 and 4.10);&#13;
(b)   Project Implementation Arrangements (PIAs) would be concluded between&#13;
the Borrower and the 14 provinces when they (i) have separated the quality&#13;

the Bank Group (para. 3.43);&#13;
(e)   If any of the subprojects have any resettlement, it has to be carried out&#13;
according to principles and procedures acceptable to the Bank Group and,&#13;
if the numbers of primary affected persons in any subproject reach 200,&#13;
the province concerned will submit a resettlement action plan to the Bank&#13;
Group for review as a condition of eligibility for inclusion in the project&#13;
(para. 3.44);&#13;
(f)    All farm and seed coating chemicals procured through the project would be&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
(h)   It would maintain and support the CPMO and the PPMOs with terms of&#13;
reference, composition and resources acceptable to the Bank Group (para.&#13;
4.4);&#13;
(i)    Each project province would introduce, no later than December 31, 1996, a&#13;
program of random field crop inspection and testing of packed seed (para.&#13;
4.9);&#13;
(j)    Annual oveiseas training and study tour plans would be submitted to the&#13;
I-P,-k Group foi prior approval and all consultants would be hired in&#13;
accordance with IBRD's guidelines on the selection and use of consultants&#13;
(para. 4.12);&#13;
(k)   Progress reports would be produced by all PPMOs, summarized by the&#13;
CPMO and forwarded to the Bank Group every six months. A mid-term&#13;
review of the project would be undertaken by the CPMO by June 30, 1998&#13;
to assess progress and chart implementation of the project for the remaining&#13;
period (para. 4.13); and&#13;
(1)    The Borrower would establish, no later than December 31, 1997, a fee&#13;
system for variety testing and registration, field inspection and seed testing&#13;
to cover the cost of these services. Such system would be introduced no&#13;
later than June 30, 1998 in at least six Project Provinces, with a view to&#13;
introducing such system nationwide no later than June 30, 2000 (para. 6.9).&#13;
7.2   Condition  of Effectiveness.   The  Borrower would enter into  Project&#13;
Implementation Arrangements (PIAs) with at least nine project provinces satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank Group as a condition of Loan/Credit effectiveness (para. 4.5).&#13;
7.3   Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would constitute a suitable&#13;
basis for an IBRD loan of $80 million with 20 years' maturing including 5 years of grace&#13;
at the Bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans, and&#13;
an IDA credit of SDR 13.8 million, equivalent to $20 million, at IDA's standard terms&#13;
with a 35-year maturity, to the People's Republic of China.&#13;

CHINA&#13;
SEED SECTOR COMMERCIALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Description of Seed Enterprises.&#13;
1.        The project would support the participation of 31 seed enterprises&#13;
(SEs) under the project, in thirteen provinces, and would support proposals for&#13;
upgradir,g production facilities at Shanghai Seed Machinery Company, a seed&#13;
processing equipment manufacturer in Shanghai. Also the proposed joint venture&#13;
or license agreement between Shanghai Seed Machinery Company and a well&#13;
established Danish seed machinery manufacturer.&#13;
2.        The  project  would  provide  financial  and  technical  assistance,&#13;
including training to the seed enterprises, and the Shanghai Xiangmin Seed&#13;
Machinery  Company.    Financial  assistance would  cover  the  procurement  of&#13;
materials, equipment and technical services required to upgrade and expand the&#13;
existing seed processing and storage facilities, or to build new facilities. Also&#13;
the construction of administrative and marketing infrastructure required to&#13;
manage the incremental quantities of seed produced under the project. Technical&#13;
assistance and training would focus on improved management of the enterprises,&#13;
financial, control, seed handling technology, plant operation and maintenance, and&#13;
on marketing and sales.&#13;
Selected Pro_ect Participants.&#13;
3.        The seed production volumes in the following text are the gross&#13;
production of seeds before storage and processing. The financial analysis tables&#13;
take into account storage and processing losses, and segregate the seeds into&#13;
Grade-1 and Grade-2 and trash, where relevant. See the individual company tables&#13;
in Annex-4 (Table-4) for planned sales volumes in each grade.&#13;
Gansu Huanqxua State Farm.&#13;
4.        This company would produce and market 12,250 tons/year of seeds of&#13;
which 7,000 t/y would be barley seeds, 2,040 t/y wheat, 1,400 t/y Hybrid Maize,&#13;
1,660 t/y watermelon, and 150 t/y hybrid rape seeds. The company would provide&#13;
employment for 96 permanent staff at their offices, laboratories and processing&#13;
facilities, in addition to seasonal labor at the processing plant and farmers at&#13;
the production base.&#13;
5.        The  investment  planned  by  the  enterprise  would  include  land&#13;
preparation, development of 4,000 m2 of seed drying floor, 4,000 e2 of seed&#13;
stores,  1,550  M2 processing  room,  enterprise  center  and  utilities  room.&#13;
Processing equipment would include two 3t/h seed processing lines and a lt/h&#13;
processing line with three packing lines for jute sacks and polypacks. Offices&#13;
would be provided with office equipment, computers, training equipment and&#13;
internal quality control facilities. The project would also provide 3 vehicles,&#13;
1,000 tons of fertilizer and 38 tons of farm chemicals. License agreements would&#13;
be bid internationally for improved seed varieties. Training would include 40 mm&#13;
local training and 1.3mm foreign training.&#13;
6.        The project would invest Y41.7 million in capital investment excluding&#13;
contingencies, and YO.9 million in working capital. The investment would produce&#13;
a turnover of Y50.4 million and 22.6% FIRR at full rated capacity, and 17% FIRR&#13;
at 80% of rated capacity. The component would maintain a stable FIRR with normal&#13;
variations in market conditions, but a 10% reduction in sales margins would&#13;
reduce the FIRR to 11.3%. Capital growth would be good from project year 5,&#13;
resulting in cumulative net income of Y50 million in 20 years, after tax, debt&#13;
servicing and dividend payments.&#13;
&#13;

7.        This company has an equity stake in a provincial seed farm and five&#13;
County seed companies, and currently produces commercial seeds for hybrid rice,&#13;
hybrid maize, groundnut and Dogbane. The company has existing seed stores of&#13;
2,000 m7i An additional six counties will act as sales agents for the enterprise.&#13;
S.        The production of these seeds are to be increased under the project&#13;
by 23,430 tons per year of which 13,960 t/y would be hybrid rice, 4,220 t/y&#13;
hybrid maize, 4,320 t/y peanuts, and 930 t/y Dogbane (Hibiscus Canabinus). This&#13;
company would be dependent on significant quantities of maize and rice being&#13;
marketed on the inter-provincial market, and during meetings the appraisal team&#13;
noted that technical assistance will be needed for equipment selection and to&#13;
strengthen marketing skills. The company would provide employment for 68&#13;
permanent staff in addition to seasonal labor and farmers at the production base.&#13;
9.        The seed company would acquire 2 ha of land that is currently a&#13;
f)res*ry area, invest in development of 20 ha of seed production land including&#13;
a nom.nal amount of irrigaticn and rural roads. They will construct 2750 r2 of&#13;
processJng rooms, 12,000 m2 of seed drying floors and 10,600 m2 of seed stores at&#13;
12 locations. They would also construct 1200 m2 of air conditioned storage, two&#13;
enterprise (administrative) centers, 400 m2 of greenhouses and a sales room on&#13;
the Vietnam border.&#13;

to be bid internationally for improved varieties.&#13;
11.       The   capital   investment   would   be  Y192.3   million   excluding&#13;
contingencies, and investment in working capital YO.S million. This component is&#13;
the largest single investment under the project. The company would generate a&#13;
gross revenue of Y261.5 million by project year six, and a gross operating income&#13;
of Y49.133 million. The FIRR at full capacity would be 21.2%, and sensitivity&#13;
analysis indicates that the FIRR would be sensitive to increased buying prices&#13;
and decreased sales prices, but otherwise reasonably stable. Tax revenue would&#13;
be Y28.8 million at full operation.&#13;
Guizhou Provincial Seed Company.&#13;
12.       Guizhou Provincial Seed Company operates in a mountainous region and&#13;
combines the operations of 10 Prefecture and County seed companies, and currently&#13;
produces 108 t/y parent lines for hybrid maize, and 90 t/y of hybrid rice.&#13;
13.       The company would expand its production under the project of the same&#13;
products by a total of 17,277 t/y, of which 8,000 t/y would be hybrid rice, 9,000&#13;
t/y hybrid maize, 277 t/y hybrid rape in addition to growing 514 t/y of parent&#13;
seeds and 48,000 fruit tree seedlings.&#13;
14.       The company plans to acquire 1.5 ha of wasteland to develop for&#13;
commercial activities, and to invest in production bases and facilities in the&#13;
provincial capital and 3 prefectures, including the development of 3,000 ha of&#13;
seed production land, 38 km of irrigation, 40 km power lines and 32 km of rural&#13;

computers, training equipment and internal quality control facilities. The&#13;
project would also provide 4,000 tons of fertilizer and 100 tons of farm&#13;
chemicals, and the investment would include license agreements for new varieties.&#13;
16.       The   capital   investment   would   be  Y131.4   million  excluding&#13;
contingencies, and YO.4 million working capital. The company would generate&#13;
annual gross revenue of Y170.9 million by project year six, and a gross operating&#13;
income of Y27.7 million.&#13;
17.       The FIRR at full capacity would be 26.1%, would be sensitive to&#13;
increased buying prices and decreased sales prices, but otherwise reasonably&#13;
stable. Tax revenues would be Y16.7 million at full operation.&#13;
Hunan: Jan Shan State Farm.&#13;
18.       Jan Shan Farm proposes to produce 1,596 t/y of seeds of which; 1,596&#13;
t/y would be hybrid rice, and 4,000 t/y acid delinted cotton seeds for sale in&#13;
the local market. A proportion of the ADS cottonseed will be planted out in&#13;
plastic greenhouses for sale as 12 million seedlings per year, to enable farmers&#13;
to gain growing time in the Spring. The hybrid rice parent line will be procured&#13;
through ICB or ILB procurement, and would be available from CAAS institutes&#13;
within China.&#13;
19.       The company would not acquire land but proposes to develop 1,000 ha&#13;
of production base including irrigation, drainage and 10 km of internal roads.&#13;
They will also construct a seed drying floors 3,000 ml, seed store 2200 m2,&#13;
process  and  packing  rooms  896  m2,  an  air-conditioned  store  200  m2,  an&#13;
administrative office and utilities room for the enterprise, and also erect&#13;
40,000 m2 of plastic tunnels. They will procure office equipment, quality control&#13;
equipment, and 5 vehicles. Technical assistance and training will include 50 mm&#13;
local, 1 mm foreign training and 4.5 mm foreign study tours. The project would&#13;
also provide 2,000 tone of fertilizer and 30 tons of farm chemicals, and provide&#13;
Yl.5 million for genetic materials.  The large area of plastic tunnels is&#13;
supported by the planting requirements of 12 million seedlings in pots at 2.8&#13;
million per ha.&#13;
20.       The capital investment would be Y38.9 million excluding contingencies,&#13;
and working capital YO.2 million. The company would generate a gross revenue of&#13;
Y42.1 millicn by project year six, and a gross operating income of Y13.9 million.&#13;
The FIRR at full capacity would be 24%, and the sensitivity analysis indicates&#13;
the FIRR would be stable under normal variations in operating and marketing&#13;
conditions with the exception of decreases in sales prices. Reduced margins of&#13;
10% reduces the FIRR to 16.4%. Tax revenues would be Y7.9 million at full&#13;
operation.&#13;
Hunan Provincial Seed ComDany.&#13;
21.       This provincial seed company is located in 5 prefectures and 10&#13;
counties, and plans to produce and market 7,000 t/y of hybrid rice seed, 4,095&#13;
t/y of hybrid maize, 504 t/y of hybrid rapeseed, and 2,500 t/y of acid delinted&#13;
cotton seeds.&#13;
22.       The company would not acquire land but proposes to develop existing&#13;
lard including water supply, 76 km of on farm irrigation, drainage and 10 km of&#13;
power lines and 25 km of internal roads. They will also construct a seed drying&#13;
floors 9,000 m2, seed store 4,770 m2, process and packing rooms 1,644 m2, an air-&#13;
conditioned store 200 m2, an 15 administrative offices and utilities room for the&#13;

bags, requiring two packing machines per process line.&#13;
23.       Technical assistance and training will include 200 mm local training,&#13;
6 mm foreign training and 20 mm local consultants and 6 mm foreign study tours.&#13;
The project would also provide 3,500 tons of fertilizer,  34 tons of farm&#13;
chemicals and 790 kg of hormones, and provide Y3.4 million for genetic materials.&#13;
24.       The   capital   investment   would   be  Y131.4   million   excluding&#13;
contingencies, and working capital YO.4 million. The company would generate a&#13;
gross revenue of Y148.7 million by project year six, and a gross operating income&#13;
of Y45.8 million. The FIRR at full capacity would be 26%, and the sensitivity&#13;
analysis indicates the FIRR would be stable under normal variations in operating&#13;
and marketing conditions. Reduced margins of 10% reduces the FIRR to 17%. Tax&#13;
revenues would be Y25.7 million at full operation. Company growth would be strong&#13;
from project year 5, achieving Y180 million cumulative net revenue by project&#13;
year 20.&#13;
Hubei: Ren Min Da Yuan State Farm.&#13;
25.       This Farm currently produces wheat, hybrid rice, cotton and rape seed&#13;
for its own use, and supplements shortages in cotton seeds from outside&#13;
suppliers. The new company will be jointly owned by Ren Min Da Yuan Agro-&#13;
Technical Services Company by the provision of Y5.5 million in cash, and by the&#13;
Ren Min Da Yuan Grain, Oil and Food Company by the provision of Y5.6 million&#13;
cash.&#13;
26.       The company proposes  to expand production by  3,920  t/y of ADS&#13;
cottonseed, 1,100 t/y hybrid maize, 2,500 t/y conventional rice and 210 t/y of&#13;
rapeseed. Construction would comprise of 2,000 m2 of drying floor, 2,250 m2 of&#13;
seed stores, 1,000 m2 of processing and packing rooms,  two steel seed storage&#13;
silos and an office block.&#13;
27.       One  3t/h  acid  delinting  plant  would  process  all  of  the  seed&#13;
requirements for the farm and leave 1,000 t/y for sale on the local market. With&#13;
the addition of an air screen separator the system could also handle the maize,&#13;
rice and rapeseed. Training would be provided for 15 mm of local training, 4 mm&#13;
foreign training and 2 mm local study tours. The project would support the supply&#13;
of 500 tons of fertilizer and 2 tons of farm chemicals. The Farm would also&#13;
invest Y100,000 in improved genetic materials.&#13;
28.       Ren Min Da Yuan Farm is part of a State Farm unit that has massive&#13;
debts, although Ren Min Da Yuan Farm is said to be operating in profit. The Farm&#13;
has extricated itself as an autonomous company (see ownership above), completely&#13;
severing management and financial control from the debt laden parent unit, and&#13;
has provided it's own annual accounts statement and balance sheet showing a&#13;
profitable operation. The parent State Farm has no call on the cash flow of this&#13;
project component.&#13;
29.       The capital investment would be Y39.6 million excluding contingencies,&#13;
and working capital YO.2 million. The company would generate a gross revenue of&#13;
Y33.2 million by project year six, and a gross operating income of Y12.6 million.&#13;
The FIRR at full capacity would be 22.6%, and the sensitivity analysis indicates&#13;
the FIRR would be stable under normal variations in operating and marketing&#13;
conditions, but at 80% operating capacity the FIRR falls to 16.7%. Tax revenues&#13;
would be Y7.0 million at full operation. Net revenues would be negative in&#13;
project year 4 requiring a short term loan of Y4.9 million to support company&#13;
running costs. Cumulative net revenue builds satisfactorily over the 20 year&#13;
project life to Y38 million.&#13;
Hubei: Dona Xi Hu State Farm.&#13;
30.       This State Farm proposal is virtually identical to the Ren Min Da Yuan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
- 61 -                                Page 5 of 17&#13;
State Farm proposal. Dong Xi Hu belongs to the same debt laden Provincial State&#13;
Farm unit, and this company has also severed itself from the provincial unit in&#13;
order to be accepted into the project.&#13;
31.       Planned production would be 4,460 t/y of ADS cotton, 165 t/y of hybrid&#13;
rice, 2,120 t/y of conventional rice and 1,106 t/y of barley. The company&#13;
proposes to construct 2,000 m2 of drying floor, 2000 m2 of seed stores, 1,000 m2&#13;
of processing and packing rooms, an office block and utilities room. One 3t/h&#13;
acid delinting plant would be constructed, and with the addition of an air screen&#13;
separator the system could also handle the rice and barley. Training would be&#13;
provided for 17 mm of local training and 4 mm of foreign training. The project&#13;
would support the supply of 500 tons of fertilizer and 2 tons of farm chemicals.&#13;
The Farm would also invest Y100,000 in improved genetic materials.&#13;
32.       The   capital   investment   would   be  Y41.3   million,   excluding&#13;
contingencies, and working capital YO.2 million. The company would generate a&#13;
gross revenue of Y33.2 million by project year six, and a gross operating income&#13;
of Y12.9 million. The FIRR at full capacity would be 22%, and the sensitivity&#13;
analysis indicates the FIRR would be stable under normal variations in operating&#13;
ard marketing conditions, but would reduce to 16% with 10% reduction in sales&#13;
margins. Tax revenues would be Y7.3 million at full operation.&#13;
Hubei: State Farm Traditig Company.&#13;
33.       The State Farm rrading company would procure seeds from growers, under&#13;
contract, and would process, store and trade the seeds. The company plans to sell&#13;
5,250 t/y of hybrid rice, 6,300 t/y of wheat, 7,840 t/y of acid delinted cotton&#13;
seed, 105C t/y of rape, and 210 t/y of vegetable seeds.&#13;
3A.       The project would support investment in 2,300 m2 of drying floors,&#13;
2,000 m2 of seed stores, 1,200 m2 of processing plant, one enterprise center and&#13;
utilities room of 532 m2, eleven retail outlets of 550 M2. The project would also&#13;
provide two 3 t/h seed processing lines, one acid delinting plant of 1.5 t/h,&#13;
testing equipment, computers, office equipment, utilities, and 8 vehicles.&#13;
Training would comprise 7 mm local training, 4 mm foreign training and 1 mm local&#13;
consultant. The company would also invest Y100,000 in new genetic materials.&#13;
35.       Capital investment would be Y33.3 million excluding contingencies, and&#13;
YO.7 million for working capital. The company would generate a gross revenue of&#13;
Y153.0 million by project year six, and a gross operating income of Y10.5&#13;
million. The FIRR at full capacity would be 21%, and the sensitivity analysis&#13;
indicates the FIRR would be very sensitive to increased buying prices or&#13;
decreased selling prices, with 10% reduced margins producing negative FIRR. Tax&#13;
revenues would be Y8.1 million at full operation.&#13;
Jiangsu: Apri-BUBinesB Corporation.&#13;
36.       This enterprise proposed a significant investment in the development&#13;
of five State Farms and the agri-business company. The proposal would have&#13;
invested heavily in land development, a fertilizer mix plant and a trucking&#13;
company. The farms currently produce 5,200 tons of wheat seed, 980 tons of rice,&#13;
3,900 tons of cotton seed, and 1,700 tons of barley seed. The proposal would&#13;
produce an incremental 28,522 tons per year of seeds, predominantly wheat, rice,&#13;
barley and cotton. In discussions with the Corporation revisions were made to&#13;
the investment to include only the proposals that were directly related to&#13;
incremental seed production.&#13;
37.       The fertilizer mix plant was therefore deleted, and the trucking fleet&#13;
and land development investments reduced to the actual requirements for&#13;
incremental production. The acid delinting plant was decreased from 3 t/h to 1.5&#13;
t/h as the volume of seed to be processed would be achievable with the smaller&#13;
equipment. In its revised form the corporation would produce and market 9,000 t/y&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
- 62 -                                Page 6 of 17&#13;
of rice, 2,160 t/y of hybrid rice, 17,700 t/y of wheat, 4,200 t/y of barley,&#13;
2,200 t/y soybeans, 200 t/y hybrid rape, and 2,100 t/y of sugarbeet.&#13;
38.       The project would acquire 8 ha of land that is currently a derelict&#13;
building site, for commercial operations, and would invest in 6,860 ha of land&#13;
development, irrigation, drainage, power supply and internal roads, 5,000 mZ of&#13;
drying floors, 7,750 m2 of seed stores, 1,630 m2 of processing plant and packing&#13;
rooms, six enterprise centers and utilities rooms of 3192 M2.&#13;
39.       The investment would also provide four 3 t/h seed processing and&#13;
packing lines, and four sets of testing equipment, computers, office equipment&#13;
and utilities. Also 15 vehicles, 15 tractors and 14 items of agricultural&#13;
equipment. Training would comprise 40 mm local training, 6 mm foreign training&#13;
and 6 mm local and 6mm foreign study tours, and 6 mm local consultants. The&#13;
company would also invest in 7,000 tons of fertilizers, 63 tons of farm&#13;
chemicals, and Y3 million in local licenses for new genetic materials.&#13;
40.       Capital investment would be Y93.9 million excluding contingencies, and&#13;
Y0.8 million for working capital. The company would generate a gross revenue of&#13;
Y120.4 million by project year six, and a gross operating income of Y30.3&#13;
million. The FIRR at full capacity would be 22%, and the sensitivity analysis&#13;
indicates the FIRR would be stable under normal variations in operating and&#13;
marketing conditions, falling to 17% FIRR at 80% operating capacity. Tax revenues&#13;
would be Y17.5 million at full operation.&#13;
41.       The Jiangsu Agribusiness Corporation is part of a State Farm unit that&#13;
has substantial debts, and has confirmed that the company has been severed from&#13;
the parent company as an autonomous company.&#13;
Jiangxi: State Farm (Provincial) Seed Trading Company.&#13;
42.       This company would be a new Provincial Trading Company in which the&#13;
General Bureau of State Farms would take 25% share, but the Bureau currently has&#13;
debts of Y226 million. The inclusion of this company in the project would,&#13;
therefore, be dependent on finding a shareholder that has funds to finance the&#13;
20% equity required by the Bank. At the time of appraisal the trading company had&#13;
not yet provided details of this shareholder (See State of Preparation - Follow-&#13;
Up).&#13;
43.       The investment in this proposal would be for 200 M2 seed stores, an&#13;
office and utility block of 632 m2, testing equipment, office equipment, training&#13;
equipment and eight vehicles. Training would include 8.3 mm local training, 0.5&#13;
mm foreign training, and two weeks of study tours. The company would also procure&#13;
270 tons of fertilizer.&#13;
44.       Capital investment would be Y9.9 million excluding contingencies, and&#13;
YO.1 million for working capital. The company would generate a gross revenue of&#13;
Y14.6 million by project year six, and a gross operating income of Y2.8 million.&#13;
The FIRR at full capacity would be 19.5%, and the sensitivity analysis indicates&#13;
the FIRR would be sensitive to increased buying prices, decreased sales prices,&#13;
and to product throughput capacity. The FIRR decreases to 13 % at 80% sales&#13;
capacity.&#13;
45.       The investment requires an additional short term loan of Y1.6 million&#13;
in project years 3 and 4 to support operational costs and debt servicing, and&#13;
produces a small incremental net revenue after tax and debt servicing, of YS&#13;
million by prcject year 20. i.e. a marginally profitable operation.&#13;
Jiangxi: TaJ He State Farm.&#13;
46.       Tai He State Farm will produce 364 t/y plantago and 1,830 t/y of&#13;
peanut seed, of which plantago is a very fine seed with 1,000 seed weight 1.19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;

Shanghai: Xianamin Machinery Companv.&#13;
89.       This enterprise is a State Farm company that manufactures a wide range&#13;
of agricultural machinery and seed processing equipment. The company has provided&#13;
seed processing lines to 20 county seed companies under the World Bank financed&#13;
Henan ADP. Their existing equipment range is well constructed, and the company&#13;
offers an excellent service to their clients including installation, training,&#13;
and servicing contracts.&#13;
90.       Their equipment designs and manufacturing procedures lack some of the&#13;
technical advantages of top class imported equipment. In particular the company&#13;
lacks good designs for key equipment such as air screen separators and gravity&#13;
tables that form the basis of good seed separating systems. They also do not have&#13;
the required high quality machine tools, screen presses and perforators to&#13;
produce accurate drum separators and screens.  The mechanical "doffers" that&#13;
clean the air screens during operation in their present range of seed separators&#13;
are far less efficient than the latest rubber ball cleaners now used in imported&#13;
equipment.&#13;
91.       Gravity  separator tables produced by this company also need an&#13;
improved control system to gain the accuracy and reliability of foreign machines.&#13;
The company does not have computer aided design (CAD) facilities that are now&#13;
used by most suppliers to produce plant layout drawings to each clients&#13;
requirements, or the computer aided manufacturing (CAM) equipment that translates&#13;
the CAD designs into shop floor manufacturing instructions.&#13;
92.       The company has approached several major European seed equipment&#13;
manufacturers for either a joint venture agreement or a license agreement that&#13;
would enable the company to upgrade its seed processing machinery to the latest&#13;
technology. They have received a interest from a number of companies that might&#13;
license equipment manufacture to the Shanghai Company, or would use the company&#13;
as sales and service agents.&#13;
93.       The Shanghai company would therefore invest under the project in&#13;
construction of a new workshop, the necessary machine tools, CAD/CAM design and&#13;
manufacturing equipment and in one or more technical collaboration agreements to&#13;
upgrade their seed processing equipment technology and production facilities.&#13;
This component of the project is an important step in assisting the China seeds&#13;
&#13;

CHINA&#13;
SEED SECTOR COMMERCIALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
PLANTER BOX SEED SURVEYS&#13;
PURPOSE&#13;
The purpose of the "Planter Box Seed Surveys" is to survey the quality of seeds of selected&#13;
crops saved by farmers for planting (the so-called informal seed sector) and to compare the&#13;
quality of the farmer-saved seeds with that of seeds of the same kind and variety available&#13;
in the market.&#13;
GENERAL PROCEDURE&#13;
The surveys will be made at planting time for the selected crops so that information on seeds&#13;
actually being planted can be obtained along with a small sample for analysis and testing.&#13;
CROP SEED KINDS SURVEYED&#13;
Wheat, soybean and/or conventional rice, i.e., non-hybrid. These are important crops of the&#13;
self-pollinated type for which seed saving by farmers is a common practice worldwide. It&#13;
might be difficult to find a suitable area for surveying where conventional rice is planted by&#13;
a sufficient portion of farmers for convenient survey. If this turns out to be the case, the&#13;
focus should be on wheat and soybean. Soybean is included because the seeds are more&#13;
difficult for farmers to save with good maintenance of quality than most other seed kinds.&#13;
On the other hand, seeds of rice are perhaps the easiest seeds to save with good maintenance&#13;
of quality. Shandong province is recommended for soybean; Henan for wheat.&#13;
SURVEY AREAS&#13;
Representative counties in Shandong (soybean) and Henan (wheat) provinces for each of the&#13;
two seed kinds to be surveyed should be selected and within each county, one or more&#13;
villages with a population of several hundred farmers to provide for a good sample of 100&#13;
farmers in the field planting during the planting season. The survey would be repeated in&#13;
the same or an adjacent county the following season in the same manner to provide two 100&#13;
farmer samples for each seed kind for total of 200 farmers.&#13;
SURVEY PERIOD AND NUMBERS&#13;
- 2 seed kinds (wheat and soybean or conventional rice)&#13;
- 2 years&#13;
- 100 farmers per kind per year&#13;
- 2 seed kinds (areas) x 2 years x 100 farmers/survey = 400 farmers.&#13;
400 farmers = 400 samples&#13;
&#13;

ORGANIZATION, COLLABORATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
The surveys should be under the general sponsorship of the Project Management Office in&#13;
association with the Provincial PMO of the Province or Provinces selected for the surveys.&#13;
The Provincial Seed Administration(s) or Seed Administrations of the Prefecturate(s) in which&#13;
the counties to be surveyed are located should be responsible for the surveys with a qualified&#13;
person assigned as Survey Leader. Collaboration should be established with the major seed&#13;
company in the area and with the Agrotechnical Extension Centers to assist with selection&#13;
of the survey areas, accompany and assist the surveyors, provide transportation and be&#13;
helpful in other ways..&#13;
- Personnel of the Provincial or Prefectural Seed Stations would   &amp;x'J te&#13;
farmers, obtain the desired information and collect samples. Transportation&#13;
would be provided by the pertinent Administration.&#13;
- The Provincial or Prefectural Seed Testing Laboratory would make the&#13;
purity and germination analyses of the samples collected. To the extent&#13;
possible, the purity analyses would include an assessment of varietal purity&#13;
as well as physical purity, and observations on seed health would be made&#13;
during the purity analysis and germination test.&#13;
- The Agrotechnical Extension Center would be responsible for planting out&#13;
the samples in the field for additional observations on varietal purity.&#13;
SURVEY PROCEDURES AND EVALUATIONS&#13;
- Two to four person team would move through survey area during planting&#13;
season for the crop, identify farmers actually planting the crop or making&#13;
preparations to plant in the next several days, obtain specified information&#13;
from the farmer and a sample of the seeds that are or will be planted. The&#13;
size of seed sample will be 1 kg and the seeds will be replaced with clean.&#13;
good quality seeds of the same variety. The farmer will be asked to plant the&#13;
replacment seeds in one location and mark the location with bamboo poles&#13;
with cloth "flags" at the beginning and end of the replacement seeds.&#13;
- The information collected from each farmer surveyed would be relatively&#13;
brief and simple: name and location of field (for followup visit); number of&#13;
mu to be planted; seeding rate per mu; the variety and source of seed (where&#13;
did he get the seeds he is planting?, saved himself, from neighbor, from seed&#13;
company, from extenstion center, other); why did he choose the&#13;
source of seed that he chose?; why did he choose the variety that is being planted?&#13;
- The 1 kg samples would be taken at to the seed testing laboratory that will&#13;
do the work and divided into two 500 g samples. One sample would be used&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -                                  Annex 2&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
for purity, germination and other laboratory tests; the other sample would be&#13;
used for the field planting. The laboratory tests would be made using&#13;
standard procedures with the additional assessments and observations on&#13;
varietal purity and seed health as mentioned above. The field tests would be&#13;
only for obervations on varietal purity and consist of duplicate rows of each&#13;
sample, 125 -150 seeds per row thinned in seedling stage to approximately&#13;
100 plants. Row and plant spacing would be closer than for VCU testing.&#13;
Varietally pure seeds of each variety represented in the survey (obtained from&#13;
foundation seed stocks) would be planted in the row before and after the&#13;
survey rows. The field plantings would be evaluated several times to&#13;
determine variety purity and make observations on specific diseases.&#13;
- Followup visits would be made to 25 of the farmers surveyed to observe the&#13;
performance of the varietally pure, processed and good quality seeds that&#13;
replaced the seeds taken in the sample.&#13;
- The survey leader would assemble the results of the laboratory analyses and&#13;
field evaluations, categorize the samples according to source of seeds (i.e.,&#13;
home-saved, neighbor, seed company, seed station, other) and make&#13;
appropriate comparisions of quality among the sources of seeds surveyed.&#13;
Additional data for analysis and comparison could be obtained from&#13;
laboratory test results of samples of seeds of the same variety for seeds&#13;
marketed in the county or prefecturate by seed companies and seed stations.&#13;
REQUIREMENTS&#13;
The requirements for the surveys would not be great. For an extension effort of these sorts,&#13;
personnel time ought to be assigned. The remaining requirements would be: transportation&#13;
costs for the survey; seeds from seed companies operating in the area of the different&#13;
varieties encountered to replace the 1 kg sample taken from farmer; laboratory supplies and&#13;
materials for testing; use of equipment, materials and field plots for field tests. An adequate&#13;
and reasonable budget for essential requirements would be about Y160 per sample. For the&#13;
two years of the survey, 2 crops, and 100 samples/crop/year, the budget would be:&#13;
100 samples x 2 crops x 2 years x 160 = Y64.000 (maximum, it could  be nuch&#13;
less depending on cooperators &amp; cooperation.&#13;

CHINA&#13;
SEED SECTOR COMMERCIALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
PILOT COMPANIES FOR COMMERCIALIZATION&#13;
1.        In order tc establish company structures which could serve as models&#13;
for the commercialization of the Chinese seed sector, 3 pilot companies were&#13;
identified which will be monitored closely throughout the implementation phase&#13;
of the Project. The 3 pilot companies are based on current operations of (i) a&#13;
state farm, (ii) a prefecture seed company, and (iii) a provincial seed company.&#13;
These companies will be formed as limited liability companies or limited&#13;
liability stock companies under Chinese Company laws as adopted in December 29,&#13;
1993. Operationally, these companies will be structured quite differently and&#13;
are intended to serve as examples for other entities pursuing the objective of&#13;
commercialization. Under the Project it is proposed that these pilot companies&#13;
be provided with additional training and technical assistance to ensure&#13;
successful conversion to commercialized operations. Monitoring procedures have&#13;
been identified to ensure that these companies will accomplish their objectives.&#13;
Zhangqiu State Farm&#13;
2.        Zhangqiu State Farm (ZSF) is located in the Zhangqiu Prefecture in&#13;
Shandong Province: ZSF operates on about 8,000 mu (530 ha), half of which is used&#13;
for the production of grain. The state farm recently concluded an exclusive&#13;
agreement with the Zhangqiu Municipal Leek Research Institute (ZMLRI) for the&#13;
representation of new varieties. ZMLRI is the only institute in China involved&#13;
in the development of new varieties of leek. All leek seed grown commercially in&#13;
China today is hybrid seed.&#13;
3.        ZSF originally proposed to operate the seed business as a separate&#13;
division of the state farm; subsequent to several reviews, however, it was&#13;
decided that the seed business be spun off the state farm operations and&#13;
established as a limited liability company, Zhangqiu Leek Seed Company (ZLSC).&#13;
This company will assume the licensing agreement with ZMLRI and will be&#13;
responsible for the production and marketing of foundation and commercial seed.&#13;
ZLSC will contract for all of its seed production requirements; while ZSF will&#13;
be a preferred seed producer due to its longstanding experience with the&#13;
production of high quality leek seed, production will also be contracted with&#13;
other seed producers to ensure a competitive environment. Foundation seed will&#13;
be marketed under licensing arrangements and commercial seed will be marketed&#13;
either direct or through representatives in other provinces.&#13;
4.        Annually China produces leek on about 267,000 ha; at planting rates&#13;
of 7.5 kg/ha this requires about 2,000 t of commercial seed. This commercial seed&#13;
can be produced on about 2,600 ha (seed yields of 750 kg/ha) which requires about&#13;
20 t of foundation seed (7.5 kg/ha). At foundation seed yields of about 380&#13;
k-/ha, 20 t can be produced on about 50 ha. Under the Project, ZLSC plans to&#13;
market about 20 t of foundation seed annually and to increase sales of commercial&#13;
seed to about 700 t over 5 years.&#13;
5.        Leek seed will be the primary product of ZLSC; however, in order to&#13;
have a minimum of diversification, the company will also market celery seed&#13;
(about 100 t/year) and radish seeds (about 200 t/year) under agreements with the&#13;
Institute for Vegetable Seeds in Shandong.&#13;
6.        As ZLSC will be created as a limited liability company with a minimum&#13;
of two initial shareholders. Chinese law required limited liability companies&#13;
and limited liability stock companies to be supervised by a Board of Directors.&#13;
This board will be composed of one representative each of ZLSC, ZSF, ZMLRI,&#13;
Zhangqiu City Seed Cc-.pany, and a contract seed producer. Management will report&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
An3&#13;
- 90 -                            Page 2 of 7&#13;
to this board as management in a shareholding company would report to the board&#13;
of directors.&#13;
7.        The general manager of the company will be assisted by two deputies;&#13;
one being responsible for finance and sales/marketing, the other responsible for&#13;
seed production and conditioning. The quality assurance function as well as&#13;
support services will report directly to the general manager. Total company staff&#13;
will be approximately 50.&#13;
8.        Of critical importance for the company will be the supply of new,&#13;
improved germplasm on a regular basis. In the past, release of new varieties in&#13;
China was rather slow; research institutes constantly made improvements to once&#13;
released varieties, but they did not change the designation of the product. This&#13;
policy resulted in the fact that varieties marketed today do no longer truly&#13;
resemble the characteristics of the original product but they are still marketed&#13;
under the designation of that original product. This situation will change with&#13;
the introduction of plant breeders' rights (PBR). - In its negotiations with&#13;
ZMLRI, ZLSC will ensure that new varieties will be available on a regular basis.&#13;
ZMLRI will have the responsibility to describe these varieties and to obtain&#13;
protection under PBR; ZLSC will have the responsibility to ensure varietal purity&#13;
so that the product which is marketed truly reflects the characteristics as&#13;
described by ZMLRI. ZLSC will pay a license fee (royalty) to ZMLRI for the right&#13;
to produce and market the products developed by the institute, and this license&#13;
will be established as a percentage of the price for which ZLSC sells its seed.&#13;
This arrangement will significantly change the marketing of seeds; ZLSC will&#13;
regularly launch new products into the market, they will have to manage "product&#13;
cycles" including the phasing out of products on the decline.&#13;
9.        In its seed production operations,  ZLSC will  have to negotiate&#13;
contracts which take into account the actual cost of production incurred by the&#13;
producers plus a small premium for their efforts to produce seed as compared to&#13;
a commercial crop. Superior quality should demand a higher premium. However, as&#13;
sales prices for seed will remain rather low in comparison with world market&#13;
prices for a number of years, it is of utmost importance for all seed companies&#13;
that they control their seed production cost and attempt to keep them as low as&#13;
possible. Only this policy will allow them to make a reasonable profit from their&#13;
operations which can then be reinvested into the business (including research).&#13;
10.       ZLSC intends to market its seed through 4 sales points within the&#13;
prefecture as well as through representatives/agents in other regions. One major&#13;
customer will be Zhangqiu City Seed Company which already today sells several&#13;
hundred tons of leek seed to provinces such as Liaoning, Anhui, Henan, Shanxi,&#13;
and others. A brand image and identity for Zhangqiu leek seed has been&#13;
established. ZLSC must ensure that it uses this brand identity to its advantage&#13;
while creating its own identity for seed of superior quality. ZLSC will have to&#13;
segment its markets, particularly in regards to the sale of foundation vs.&#13;
commercial seed; and ZLSC must very carefully select the customers to whom they&#13;
sell foundation seed to ensure that the high quality of its foundation seed is&#13;
maintained in the commercial seed produced by these customers.&#13;
11.       ZLSC will eutablish its own company internal quality assurance program&#13;
to ensure that these quality issues are being observed. Thus the quality&#13;
assurance department has a responsibility not only for the seed produced by the&#13;
company but also must, from time to time, check the seed produced by the&#13;
company's licensees. The quality standards established by this quality assurance&#13;
program will be superior to those established in the official government&#13;
regulations.&#13;
12.       Significant training and technical assistance will be provided for&#13;
ZLSC to ensure that management is equipped with the knowledge and understanding&#13;
for the company to accomplish its objectives. Also, monitoring procedures and&#13;
performance indicator- have been identified to measure the companies progress.&#13;

These will be explained in the summary section.&#13;
ZiBo Prefecture Seed Company&#13;
13.       ZiBo Prefecture Seed Company (ZPSC) is located in the city of ZiBo in&#13;
Shandong province. The company operates with a staff of 50 people, it maintains&#13;
a central office and seed cleaning facility, a research farm, and 6 retail stores&#13;
in the municipality of ZiBo. All management staff of ZPSC are agronomists,&#13;
holding the responsibilities of (i) general manager, also responsible for&#13;
finance, (ii) vegetable seed sales manager, (iii) wheat and corn sales manager,&#13;
(iv) manager for buildings/services/engineering, (v) research and production&#13;
manager.&#13;
14.       ZPSC developed its proposal for participation in the Project based on&#13;
an in-house research program for chinese cabbage and the recent acquisition of&#13;
the production and marketing rights to a corn hybrid. The company suggests that&#13;
the functions and responsibilities of the seed station have already been&#13;
separated from its operations; this is yet to be verified. The company intends&#13;
to continue operating as a stand-alone operation but to increase its market share&#13;
in hybrid corn and to expand interregional marketing of vegetable seeds.&#13;
15.        ZPSC will be established as a limited liability company, as with&#13;
Zhangqiu, the company will have at least two shareholders; and it was suggested&#13;
to offer a minority interest also to the managers. Management will report to a&#13;
Board of Directors whose members will represent the shareholders as well as&#13;
successful local businesses.   The land and buildings which the company will&#13;
operate will be transferred to the company by transfer of a "right to use".&#13;
These rights will be valued as equity contributions by the shareholders to the&#13;
capital stock of the company; and the transfer of these rights will be signed off&#13;
on by local government to ensure that management is autonomous in deciding on the&#13;
use of these land and buildings.&#13;
16.       The general manager will report directly to the Board of Directors;&#13;
he will be assisted by three deputies responsible for (i) seed production and&#13;
conditioning, (ii) research, foundation seed production, and variety testing,&#13;
(iii) marketing and sales of seed of Chinese cabbage and hybrid corn. The finance&#13;
department, the quality assurance department, and the support services will&#13;
report directly to the general manager. Total company staff will be about 50.&#13;
17.       In vegetable seeds, ZPSC has about 1,400 accessions of Chinese cabbage&#13;
as its proprietary germplasm pool; the research effort is directed towards the&#13;
development of hybrids. Total cost of the research program is about 300,000 Yuan&#13;
per year. While the company considers its genetic basis as sufficient and its&#13;
hybrids superior as regards quality and earliness, ZPSC will change its products&#13;
release policy as described above for Zhangqiu, including protection of new&#13;
varieties under PBR. ZPSC will also begin significant efforts to identify other&#13;
sources for improved germplasm nationally and internationally. These products&#13;
would be secured for the company either through licensing operations or&#13;
otherwise.&#13;
18.       In corn  seeds  ZPSC  will  also  actively  pursue  new  sources  for&#13;
germplasm. Presently the company has a production and marketing right to one corn&#13;
hybrid developed by Shandong Agricultural Research Institute; under the project&#13;
the company will explore both national and international breeders for improved&#13;
products.&#13;
19.       Concerning seed production, ZPSC will produce all foundation seed of&#13;
Chinese cabbage and hybrid corn on its own research farm; the technical and&#13;
management expertise to carry out this production has already been established.&#13;
Production of commercial seed will be contracted out. The seed production system&#13;
in the ZiBo prefecture is such that adequate isolation for the production of high&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -                             Annex 3&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
quality seed of different varieties can be guaranteed through contracts with&#13;
farm-households.&#13;
20.        ZPSC presently sells about 150 t of cabbage seeds annually, 15 t in&#13;
the regional market and 135 t in the interregional market; at this level the&#13;
company is not able to meet market demand. ZPSC projects to increase sales to&#13;
about 500 t/year. This increase will be accomplished through an expansion of the&#13;
existing network of representatives/agents throughout China (this network&#13;
currently extends over 25 provinces throughout the country). ZPSC has already&#13;
established a proprietary package for "ZiBo Cabbage Seed" which clearly&#13;
distinguishes it from any other source; this package also has created a brand&#13;
image for the company in the interregional market. The company will accomplish&#13;
its sales objectives by building on and expanding this brand identity. - ZPSC&#13;
presently sells its corn seeds within the prefecture; the company recently&#13;
concluded contractual arrangements with 6 county seed companies to sell ZPSC corn&#13;
seeds exclusively under the Project. ZPSC will also pursue sales opportunities&#13;
outside the prefecture, most likely through some of its vegetable seed dealers.&#13;
Following this strategy the company should accomplish its projected sales&#13;
increase of corn seeds from 500 t to 5,000 t annually.&#13;
21.       ZPSC will establish and strengthen its own company internal quality&#13;
assurance program to ensure that the highest possible seed quality is produced&#13;
and sold. As the acreage to carry out the projected production will be rather&#13;
large, the company will work with local staff in the various seed production&#13;
communities which are not permanent employees but supervise production on account&#13;
of and according to the standards of the company.   The quality standards&#13;
implemented by the company will be superior to the standards established for the&#13;
external governmental quality control inspections.&#13;
22.       Significant training and technical assistance will be provided for&#13;
ZLSC to ensure that management is equipped with the knowledge and understanding&#13;
for the company to accomplish its objectives. Also, monitoring procedures and&#13;
performance indicators have been identified to measure the companies progress.&#13;
These will be explained in the summary section.&#13;
Guangxi Provincial Seed Company&#13;
23.       Guangxi Provincial Seed Company  (GSC) is located in Nanning,  the&#13;
capital of Guangxi Province; with 83 million people this province is the third&#13;
most populated province of China. Until 1995 GPSC still operated much according&#13;
to the old hierarchical system; it was the supplier of breeder seed to most&#13;
prefecture seed companies in the province and the official quality control&#13;
laboratory was still managed by GSC.  However, as a participant in the ASSP&#13;
project the provincial government plans to accomplish the establishment of an&#13;
official laboratory outside GSC by late 1995 or early 1996; buildings have been&#13;
constructed and they are awaiting delivery of the laboratory equipment.&#13;
24.       There are 97 seed companies in the province; the provincial seed&#13;
company, 13 prefecture seed companies, and 83 county seed companies. A number of&#13;
the prefecture and county companies have already moved to a more commercialized&#13;
system and are marketing seed in the interregional trade. GSC originally intended&#13;
to form a group company with 3 prefecture seed companies and 11 county seed&#13;
companies to participate in the Project. This, however, would not have&#13;
accomplished the desired consolidation and efficiencies as every participant&#13;
would have desired to continue and expand its seed production activity. It was&#13;
therefore decided and agreed to form a limited liability stock company on the&#13;
basis of GSC with participation of 5 county seed companies.&#13;
25.        The newly formed company (GPSC) will have a group of shareholders,&#13;
electing a Board of Directors, appointing a chairman of the Board, and through&#13;
this structure superv Lse the management of the company.  The company will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -                            Page 5 of 7&#13;
managed by a general manager who would not be a member of the board; this general&#13;
manager would be assisted by 3 deputies. One deputy general manager will be&#13;
responsible for seed production and conditioning, one for sales and marketing,&#13;
and one for finance/administration.  Service functions, the quality assurance&#13;
department and evaluation of new products will report directly to the general&#13;
manager.&#13;
26.       The company will operate from its central location in Nanning where&#13;
it also maintains its foundation seed farm; away from this center there will be&#13;
5 seed production locations and one sales office at the border with Vietnam. The&#13;
production locations will be at PingGuo (Corn), HePu (peanuts and kenaf&#13;
[dogbane]), and BeiLiu, HeXian, and TianYong (hybrid rice).&#13;
27.       The shareholders will contribute to the company the right to use&#13;
certain facilities for the production of seeds; the 5 seed conditioning lines&#13;
will be installed at these facilities. The shareholders will also make available&#13;
to GPSC certain personnel during the harvest and conditioning season to allow the&#13;
company to manage its seed crop and to keep its permanent staff at a minimum.&#13;
GPSC, however, will have, through its own staff, supervisory responsibility of&#13;
all seed production operations and will also have the responsibility to service&#13;
and maintain the seed processing lines.   The number of shares held by each&#13;
shareholder will be determined after the value of the facilities to be&#13;
contributed has been established.&#13;
28.       Great responsibility will lie with the department for the evaluation&#13;
of new varieties as none of the companies joining into GPSC has any proprietary&#13;
products or research programs or holds any licenses to such products.   GPSC&#13;
therefore must urgently obtain new varieties for testing from both national and&#13;
international sources and evaluate them at multiple locations throughout the&#13;
province as well as in the interregional markets. GPSC has been put in contact&#13;
with potential international sources for new varieties and the implementation of&#13;
an accelerated testing program for such new products will be one of the benchmark&#13;
by which this company will be evaluated.&#13;
29.       In structuring GPSC it was ensured that the strongest of the initial&#13;
14 candidates for participation in the group company were selected for the new&#13;
shareholding company; the intent being that some of the seed production&#13;
operations of the other companies will become superfluous. These companies would&#13;
then become agents and/or representatives of the company for marketing its seed&#13;
products. Initial discussions on this concept have been held with a number of&#13;
these companies; this, however, can be accomplished successfully only if GPSC&#13;
proves that it is in a position to supply superior products from a standpoint of&#13;
genetics and mechanical quality at competitive prices.&#13;
30.       GPSC will establish its own internal quality assurance department and&#13;
laboratory; GPSC also will establish a seed quality assurance program and&#13;
standards to be met. These standards will be above those issued by the official&#13;
government control offices.   A significant task will be to ensure uniform&#13;
implementation of these standards at all five production/processing locations.&#13;
This too will be a benchmark by which GPSC will be evaluated throughout the&#13;
implementation of the project.   In order to assist this effort, GPSC will&#13;
establish small laboratories for quick analyses directly at the processing sites;&#13;
all seed prepared for sale, however, will have to be checked by the central&#13;
laboratory in Nanning before that seed can be sold.&#13;
31.       In rice, Guangxi province produces about 2.5 million ha per year&#13;
annually in two crops; first crop is planted in January and harvested in June,&#13;
second crop is planted in July and harvested in December.  Thus the time for&#13;
harvesting/processing a seed crop is extremely short if companies have to operate&#13;
without carryover seed. Today about 70% of all rice is hybrid; it is projected&#13;
that by the year 2000 this will have increased to about 85%. At planting rates&#13;
of 22.5 kg/ha this wiil require about 47,000 t of seed annually. GPSC projects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -                            Annex 3&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
to supply about 16,000 t of hybrid rice seed by the year 2000, representing a&#13;
market share of about 21%; however, a significant quantity will also be sold into&#13;
the interregional market and to Vietnam. This can be accomplished with hybrids&#13;
of superior performance and seed of superior quality.&#13;
32.       In corn, Guangxi province produces about 530,000 ha annually, 45% of&#13;
which is hybrid; it is projected that the use of hybrid seed will increase to&#13;
about 80% by the year 2000. Planting rates, however, should decrease from the&#13;
current 45 kg/ha to about 35 kg/ha, resulting in annual seed needs of about&#13;
13,000 t. GPSC plans to accomplish sales of about 6,200 t by the year 2000,&#13;
representing a market share of about 48%. The company plans to accomplish this&#13;
objective primarily through the improvement of seed quality, thus allowing the&#13;
farmer to reduce his planting rates; longterm, however, the company also must&#13;
distinguish itself by offering improved varieties.&#13;
33.       Guangxi province produces about 190,000 ha of peanuts annually; at&#13;
planting rates of 225 kg and a four year seed replacement rate, this results in&#13;
annual seed needs of about 10,700 t. It is projected that the seed replacement&#13;
rate will change to three years as GPSC will provide a superior product to the&#13;
farmers; this scenario makes the sales projection of 4,000 t for the year 2000&#13;
attainable.&#13;
34.       In kenaf, the province produces about 4,000 t of seed annually which&#13;
is mostly sold into the interregional markets. GPSC targets a sales volume of&#13;
about 3,000 t for the year 2000, primarily by being able to replace other&#13;
producers which cannot compete with GPSC's seed quality.&#13;
35.       The buildup of a strong, customer oriented marketing and distribution&#13;
network will be a prerequisite for GPSC to accomplish its sales objectives. The&#13;
company will  build  on the  contacts  which  its  shareholders  have  already&#13;
established in the interregional markets and consolidate these, it will introduce&#13;
its own brand, and it will use it close relations with county seed companies to&#13;
supply its superior products in their markets.  Significant market research&#13;
however will have to be done to identify competitor's strengths and weaknesses&#13;
and to identify market niches.&#13;
36.       Significant training and technical assistance will be provided for&#13;
GPSC to ensure that management is equipped with the knowledge and understanding&#13;
for the company to accomplish its objectives. Also, monitoring procedures and&#13;
performance indicators have been identified to measure the companies progress.&#13;
These will be explained in the summary section.&#13;
Summary&#13;
37.       Training and technical assistance for the three pilot companies will&#13;
be coordinated to meet their needs. Foreign training will be provided for general&#13;
business management, marketing, and seed quality; local training will also be&#13;
provided for the afore mentioned as well as for finance, production, and seed&#13;
plant operations. The accomplishment of these training schedules throughout the&#13;
implementation phase of the project will be one of the performance indicators by&#13;
which these companies will be measured during supervision. Technical assistance&#13;
in the above indicated fields will be provided throughout the first two years of&#13;
operation.&#13;
38.       All companies were provided with guidelines for statutes and charters&#13;
for the establishment of these companies as legal, autonomous entities; draft&#13;
documents are to be submitted to the Bank prior to negotiation of the Loan. While&#13;
the company structures as described above appear to be satisfactory, it must yet&#13;
be ensured that these autonomous structures can actually operate autonomously&#13;
following implementation of the Project and this will be monitored closely during&#13;
supervision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
39.       All companies also must supply documentation that certain property on&#13;
which the seed processing facilities are to be constructed have been transferred&#13;
to these companies for their exclusive use and that no authority can dictate to&#13;
these enterprises to alter the intended use or to infringe on it.&#13;
40.       In  order  to  prepare  the  pilot  companies  for  a  competitive,&#13;
commercialized environment, they were directed to minimize their spending on&#13;
social services and to substitute this with higher salaries/wages. The practice&#13;
of job guarantee is to be discontinued, housing should not be provided by the&#13;
companies, and the companies are to implement the practice of hiring temporary&#13;
workers during the peak seasons so that permanent employment and the related&#13;
expenses can be minimized.&#13;
41.       Management auconomy will be measured by the ability of company&#13;
management to establish prices, production targets, purchasing and selling&#13;
policies, engage in *he import and export of seeds, decide on investments,&#13;
acquire and transfer assets, establish joint ventures, hire and dismiss&#13;
employees, manage personnel and set wages and bonuses, and decide on the use of&#13;
retained earnings.&#13;
42.       In addition to the above outlined, certain performance indicators were&#13;
developed by which the companies will be evaluated during the implementation&#13;
phase of the project. These are:&#13;
- Obtaining certificates concerning the legal status of the companies&#13;
and documentation for transfer of assets;&#13;
- Adhering to the project implementation schedules;&#13;
- Establishing a system of monitoring expenditures and commitments&#13;
during project implementation by the time of the project launch workshop;&#13;
- Achieving training objectives according to schedules;&#13;
- Establishing company internal quality standards prior to the first&#13;
seed production season;&#13;
- Realizing production and sales volumes according to the 5 year&#13;
schedules; and&#13;
- Accomplishing the per unit profit margins which were established in&#13;
the financial calculations by setting prices according to market conditions and&#13;
controlling production costs accordingly.&#13;

CHINA&#13;
SEED SECTOR COMMERCIALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Performance Indicators&#13;
1.        The major objective of this project is to assist the government in&#13;
developing a viable commercial seed sector, which can not only produce high&#13;
quality seeds in sufficient quantity and variety to satisfy farmers, needs but&#13;
also operates through efficient, self-sustained commercial enterprises.   The&#13;
project would assist in the commercialization of the seed sector (a) by helping&#13;
the government establish a seed policy and a regulatory framework that would&#13;
provide a conducive environment to enhance the competitiveness of the seed sector&#13;
and to encourage international cooperation, (b) by assisting in strengthening&#13;
institutions so that they can provide effective service and technical support to&#13;
the seed sector and (c) by supporting the modernization and rationalization of&#13;
selected seed companies.&#13;
2.        To measure progress made in implementation of the project, important&#13;
performance indicators were developed for the policy and regulatory,&#13;
institutional strengthening and commercialization components during  project&#13;
preparation (Annex 7 Table 1). These indicators, would be used to evaluate the&#13;
progress of the project and, if necessary, to redesign the project during the&#13;
mid-term review.&#13;
Policy and Reaulatorv Component:&#13;
3.        Seed Sector Policy.  The MOA is drafting a seed sector policy as part&#13;
of the National Seed Sector Industrialization Program. The policy aim to (a)&#13;
establish a modernized seed sector; (b) separate seed administration from seed&#13;
commercialization; (c) establish an integrated system of production and&#13;
marketing; (d) change in seed company structure to independent units; (e) open&#13;
up markets for interprovincial and international trade; and (f) relax price&#13;
control. The final draft of this seed sector policy would be submitted to the&#13;
State Council by the end of 1996.&#13;
4.        Seed Law.  The draft seed law is being revised and the seed law&#13;
drafting group estimates that the new seed law will be ready for submitting to&#13;
the State Council by the end of 1996.&#13;
5.        Reform and revision will be made to the following areas:&#13;
. the varietal registration and release procedure&#13;
. provisions for labelling seed for sale with seed&#13;
quality parameters&#13;
. inspection procedures for labelling for provincial external&#13;
quality control agencies&#13;
. provisions for voluntary seed certification schemes&#13;
. provisions affecting seed marketing, including the licensing of&#13;
seed marketers.&#13;
6.        Membership in International Organizations.  To commercialize the seed&#13;
sector, to improve the quality of seed stock and to encourage international&#13;
cooperation and trade, China needs to be a member of international seed&#13;
organizations. The two major organizations are the International Union for the&#13;
Protection of the New Varieties (UPOV) and International Seed Testing Association&#13;
(ISTA). It is required that a country must have acceptable plant breeder rights&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
- 140 -                           Table 2 of 5&#13;
(PBR) legal framework before joining UPOV. It is also required that ISTA testing&#13;
and laboratory utandards have to be adopted. Substantial work has already been&#13;
carried out to satisfy these requirements; the initial draft of PBR legislation&#13;
has been completed and reviewed with experts from UPOV and ISTA. In general,&#13;
this draft contains the regulations required for conformity with the requirements&#13;
of UPOV. The next steps for further action are as follows:&#13;
7.        UPOV. The drafting group for the PBR legal framework will revise the&#13;
current draft of the regulations, after unofficial advice from UPOV, to ensure&#13;
that it conforms with the provisions of the 1978 Act of the Convention. A draft&#13;
apparently conforming to the 1978 Act will then be submitted to the Council of&#13;
UPOV for advice on conformity. Following informal advice of conformity by the&#13;
Council, the responsible agency of the Government will seek formal advice from&#13;
the Council on conformity.&#13;
8.        The organizations represented on the drafting group will agree on the&#13;
location, staffing and financing of the PBR office; draft and pass into law&#13;
implementing regulations for the operation of the office; and draw up and&#13;
officially publish a list of species to be initially included under the PBR&#13;
legislation.   Then the responsible agency of Government will forward the&#13;
instrument of accession to the UPOV Council for approval.&#13;
9.        ISTA  The Seed Testing Division (STD) will continue to negotiate with&#13;
ISTA to resolve the issues that are preventing the Division from forwarding the&#13;
application for membership and authorization to issue ISTA international&#13;
certificates. STD will work on these issues and forward the application to ISTA&#13;
by the end of 1996, if the issues are resolved.&#13;
Institutional Strenathenina Component.&#13;
10.       Seed Oualitv Laboratories.   Site selection, design of facilities,&#13;
commencement of construction, and procurement of the equipment for the seed&#13;
quality testing laboratories in the official quality control agencies and seed&#13;
companies, will be initiated in the first year of the project. Prior to use of&#13;
the laboratory facilities, all laboratories will obtain copies of the official&#13;
rules for seed testing and adequately train staff in their use.&#13;
11.       External and Internal Oualitv Control Separation.  Prior to the start&#13;
of the project all provinces participating in the project will ensure the&#13;
separation, in both resources and finances, of their agencies for official&#13;
external seed quality control from the internal quality control programs of the&#13;
seed companies.&#13;
12.       Training.  Training of staff for both external and internal quality&#13;
control will take place equally in Years 1 and 2 of the project.&#13;
13.       Variety Evaluation Office Facilities.  The computers and accessories&#13;
for the National Variety Evaluation and Registration office. and the small cold&#13;
seed store specified will be procured in the first year of the project.&#13;
14.       Ouality Manaaement Workshoios. Workshops to evaluate the impact of the&#13;
operation of PBR and the seed quality management systems initiated in the project&#13;
will be organized in the Year 3 and undertaken in Years 4 and 5 of the project.&#13;
15.       Informal Sector.  Two planter box surveys of the quality of seed in&#13;
the informal seed sector, i.e., seeds saved by farmers or obtained from close&#13;
neighbors for planting, will be initiated in the first year of the project. The&#13;
results would be used by the seed companies and the agro-extension stations in&#13;
improving the quality of conventional seeds. It is expected that by the year&#13;
2005, the yield of conventional seeds would be increased by at least 10%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Commercialization Comoonent:&#13;
16.       Each seed enterprise would develop a Project Key Activities Schedule,&#13;
which in a bar chart schedule showing key indicators for monitoring project&#13;
progress (Figure 2). The first year of the project would include establishment&#13;
of facilities, training of enterprise and project managers and preparation of&#13;
bidding documents. Some seed production could begin during the first project&#13;
year, particularly the procurement and propagation of new genetic materials. The&#13;
majority of civil construction works and equipment procurement would be completed&#13;
during the second project year, with processing facilities being commissioned&#13;
before the end of the year.  Some project seeds could therefore be processed&#13;
late in the second year, but most processing and storage systems would not be&#13;
available for use until the third project year.&#13;
17.       Production, processing and marketing of seeds has been planned to&#13;
begin in project year two with 25% production, increasing to 50% in project year&#13;
three and 75% and 100% in years four and five respectively.  The production&#13;
schedules of some individual enterprises vary slightly from this average&#13;
schedule, particularly those of enterprises producing seedlings, which wouldhave&#13;
no sales until project year three.&#13;
18.       The progress of each enterprise would be evaluated according to the&#13;
Implementation plan set out in its Key Activities Schedule (Figure 2).&#13;
19.       In addition, enterprise performance would be evaluated according to&#13;
the following points:&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objective of the Seed Sector
            Commercialization Project is to assist the government in
            developing a viable commercial seed sector, which can not
            only produce high quality seeds in sufficient quantity and
            variety to satisfy farmer needs but also operates through
            efficient, self-sustained commercial enterprises. The
            project will consist of the following components: 1) a seed
            policy and regulatory framework that will enhance the
            competitiveness of the seed sector and encourage
            international cooperation; 2) modernization, rationalization
            and commercialization of selected seed companies; and 3)
            institutional strengthening in order to provide effective
            service and technical support to the seed sector.
