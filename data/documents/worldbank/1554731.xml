Abstract&#13;
Each city in a region competes over time for private and public&#13;
resources with which to move toward its potential, efficient size. That&#13;
size, and the rate at which it is approached, is conditioned by many&#13;
factors, including the nature of national, sector-specific policies; the&#13;
spatial distribution of prior infrastructure investments; and the ease&#13;
with which labor and capital can be mobilized to exploit emerging local&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
These factors can interact in ways which eventually yield faster&#13;
employment growth among secondary regional centers than in the&#13;
historically preeminent metropolitan areas'. A study of the urban system&#13;
in South/Southeast Brazil suggests that such a "polarization reversal" is&#13;
underway.&#13;
In the wake of sustained regional development, firms in an&#13;
increasing number of sectors become less susceptible to agglomeration&#13;
economies associated with city size, and more sensitive to localization&#13;
economies linked to local own-industry size. These benefits, in turn,&#13;
fall off quite rapidly with the growth of own-industry clusters, and are&#13;
thus consistent with a more decentralized pattern of urban industrial&#13;
development.&#13;
At this stage, the growth of secondary centers beyond the&#13;
metropolitan periphery depends primarily on new establishments rather than&#13;
on the transfer of metropolitan plants or the establishment of&#13;
metropolitan branches.&#13;
While secondary city officials have a limited role to play in&#13;
this process, they can help foster development by responding to demands&#13;
for the rapid, coordinated introduction of public services at the local&#13;
level.&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Summary&#13;
Each city in a regional system of cities competes over time for&#13;
private and public resources with which to move toward its potential,&#13;
efficient size. That size and the rate at which it is approached can be&#13;
affected to only a limited extent by any public sector actions taken at the&#13;
local level.  More-Important will be the particular      geofdevelopment at&#13;
which the_egion finds itself; the national institutional constratswhiih&#13;
affect the way privatainid 'public resource mobilization takes place; and the&#13;
given set of natural and manmade resource available to each city and its&#13;
hinterland. It is nevertheless reassuring for secondary city managers to know&#13;
that each of these determinants of potential size tends to evolve, often&#13;
spontaneously, in ways which encourage growth outside historically pre-eminent&#13;
centers.  One illustration of this is the-wayAi-ncremental--agglomerativon, or&#13;
clustering_,_benefits tend to fall off .for firms in many industries as any&#13;
given_city_grows larger; at the same time big city.disamenities.-(land costs,&#13;
labor cos-ts,,-congest-ion-,--pollution) create pressures for development of&#13;
alternate locations.&#13;
The trends in the evolution of the Sao Paulo system in South/&#13;
Southeast Brazil point clearly to a shift in growth patterns of population and&#13;
industrial employment, such that secondary centers now grow more rapidly than&#13;
the metropolis. This process is being led by a combination of net stationary&#13;
expansion and by the establishment of new, independent units. Relocations&#13;
and new branches play a smaller role in urban development, except for&#13;
encouraging suburbanization and, to a lesser extent, exurbanization to nearby&#13;
free-standing centers. This is because relatively few relocations and&#13;
branches involve "moves" across more than 30 kilometers from the municipality&#13;
of "origin."&#13;
Plant location decisions help explain why branching and transfers&#13;
play a secondary role, and why "births" are so important to the evolution of&#13;
most localities. The search for a location is part of a complex set of&#13;
decisions, which are usually tackled by a strategy of limited search,&#13;
economizing on information gathered and evaluated. Most alternatives&#13;
considered are within short commuting distances of the investors' existing&#13;
plants or residence. Within this radius the factors that tend to receive the&#13;
greatest attention are land and building costs, road access, and the condition&#13;
of public infrastructure.&#13;
Though secondary city officials are forced to live with their city's&#13;
limited attractiveness to metropolitan-based transfers and branches, they can&#13;
turn limited search to their advantage by fostering new local activities that&#13;
ignore metropolitan location options. Planners are unlikely successfully to&#13;
promote local development by attempting to modify radically those city&#13;
features that arise spontaneously, such as agglomeration economies. Instead&#13;
they can concentrate on providing for the rapid, coordinated introduction of&#13;
public services at the local level. They might wish to find ways to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- viii -&#13;
accelerate the development of leasable space for capital-starved, smaller&#13;
firms. Finally they can act as advocates for the business community with&#13;
national sector line agencies.&#13;
The development of secondary centers is being held back by the&#13;
outmoded structure of intergovernmental relations. Forceful steps are needed&#13;
to link national grants to improved local efforts to mobilize tax resources.&#13;
In addition consideration should be given to setting up a municipal&#13;
development banks that would allow localities to compete for development loans&#13;
repayable at market rates.&#13;
National authorities in charge of sector line agencies can also&#13;
provide the appropriate environment for local development by avoiding most&#13;
specific spatial initiatives!/ and concentrating on improving sectoral&#13;
policies. in the Brazilian South/Southeast region there is reason to believe&#13;
that non-spatial industrial promotion policies and policies affecting federal-&#13;
and state-supported infrastructure investments still favor historically pre-&#13;
eminent centers to the detriment of newer, secondary centers. Given these&#13;
distortions, spatial incentives that attempt to redirect forcibly the location&#13;
patterns of businesses involve a misdirection of public effort. The best&#13;
spatial policy is a set of efficient sectoral policies.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
Understanding Urban Concentration, Deconcentration, and&#13;
Decentralization&#13;
Each city in a regional system of cities competes over time for&#13;
private and public resources with which to move toward its potential,&#13;
efficient size. That size and the rate at which it is approached can be&#13;
affected to only a limited extent by any public sector actions taken at the&#13;
local level. More important will be the particular stage of development at&#13;
which the region finds itself and the national institutional constraints which&#13;
affect the way private and public resource mobilization taeks place.&#13;
This situation arises because the potential employment size for any&#13;
given city will depend on the local composition of goods and services&#13;
produced. The potential size of any local industry will depend on several&#13;
factors. First is the relative availability of different natural and manmade&#13;
resources. Second, is the extent to which the established subsectors of&#13;
activity can lower their costs by reaping agglomeration economies through own&#13;
industry growth. Third, is the extent to which the size of the local market&#13;
attracts footloose industries (financial and business services, high&#13;
technology manufacturing).&#13;
I/ Excepting those involving interregional linkages in communications and&#13;
transportation, where the spatial phasing of investments is inevitable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ix -&#13;
One might argue that the manmade resources, at least, are subject to&#13;
local manipulation. This is true to only a limited degree. The quantity and&#13;
quality of local skilled labor does seem to be sensitive to the variety of&#13;
public services available at the local level; a concerted effort to improve&#13;
area services could have a developmental impact. Conversely, however, major&#13;
regional transport facilities (expressways, ports, railroads) involve&#13;
investments and coordinated area planning beyond any one city's capacity to&#13;
influence decisively. Many attractive city features, such as a full array of&#13;
business and financial services, and a large network of local parts and&#13;
components suppliers, arise spontaneously.&#13;
National policies can, as noted, have a significant impact.&#13;
Discriminatory policies toward agriculture depress the hinterland around&#13;
certain cities that could otherwise flourish. Industrial protection measures&#13;
that penalize producers likely to locate in smaller centers, or that promote&#13;
producers likely to locate in larger centers, appear to have substantial&#13;
effects. If the capital markets -- for private or public use -- are organized&#13;
in such a way that access is rationed by non-price mechanisms, then the growth&#13;
of particular groups of cities will suffer. For those who worry about city&#13;
size distribution, efficient sectoral policies may be the most significant&#13;
weapon at the disposal of the public sector to nudge cities toward their&#13;
potential, efficient size.&#13;
Even then, however, account needs to be taken of the development&#13;
stages through which the region or nation is passing. No amount of good&#13;
policy-making will produce a large industrial metropolis or a flourishing set&#13;
of industrial secondary cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in a poor,&#13;
small region.&#13;
Public and private resource constraints, and the limits imposed by&#13;
regional purchasing power and labor force quality on regional production size&#13;
and diversity, all these will dictate probable outcomes at any one point in&#13;
time. One should therefore not be surprised to find the early emergence of&#13;
one or two "city states" in a region, better equipped than all rivals, and&#13;
only a very selective development of some resource-rich secondary centers.&#13;
Elsewhere, small rural-oriented service centers will dot the landscape. With&#13;
rising economic development levels metropolitan deconcentration will&#13;
inevitably emerge, as will new secondary cities within day commuting distance&#13;
from the most developed cores. At this stage, policies to stop "sprawl" or&#13;
limit the geographic perimeter of a metropolis will be as futile as premature&#13;
attempts to "create" secondary centers.&#13;
Factors Promoting Decentralized Development: Illustrations from the&#13;
Sao Paulo Region&#13;
One fear that is often voiced is that decentralized development is&#13;
made almost impossible by the accumulation of clustering economies available&#13;
to firms operating in historically pre-eminent centers. Evidence from the&#13;
urban history of developed countries suggests otherwise, and confirmation that&#13;
similar factors are at work is found in South-Southeastern Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Once the most severe constraints associated with low levels of&#13;
economic development are removed; it appears that agglomeration economies are&#13;
primarily linked to the local size of the industry to which a firm belongs.&#13;
These economies are important -- typically cutting costs by 10% as an industry&#13;
doubles its size around the mean. But, even here, the cost-cutting effects of&#13;
doubling industry size falls off rapidly beyond the industry mean. At the&#13;
same time, increasing city size itself appears to play only a secondary role&#13;
in decreasing production costs. Since growing urban population brings with it&#13;
rising land costs, labor costs, and congestion, a negative incentive develops&#13;
over time to expel established standard technology activity from the initially&#13;
preeminent centers.&#13;
Thus the basis for deconcentration is established, though only a few&#13;
proximate free-standing centers are likely to receive a large transfer of&#13;
dynamism from the metropolis through relocation of plants and opening of&#13;
metropolitan-headquartered branches. Other secondary centers will grow&#13;
independently, drawing on local entrepreneurship in the form of stationary&#13;
expansions and "births."&#13;
This can be illustrated by looking at the recent evolution of Sao&#13;
Paulo state. By 1980 urban population growth outside GSP exceeded that of the&#13;
metropolitan area in all size classes above 20,000 inhabitants, and was led by&#13;
the 10 centers whose population exceeded 100,000 in 1970. This was helped&#13;
along by similar trends in industrial employment growth: all secondary city&#13;
groupings grew faster than GSP over the recent past. Other indicators can be&#13;
marshalled to demonstrate the depth of the new industrial transformation.&#13;
Non-metropolitan growth cannot be explained by a fast growing mix of&#13;
industries. The typical industries of the secondary centers are not growing&#13;
rapidly by statewide standards; therefore good performance in these industries&#13;
in the periphery is due to other factors, linked to the improving&#13;
competitiveness of the area. Associated with this are other phenomena:&#13;
value-added per worker is converging across space, and there is a systematic&#13;
convergence in the broad industry mix profiles of the various subregions. As&#13;
the earlier framework would suggest, this convergence is clearest among the&#13;
group of cities located within 150 kilometers of Sao Paulo city.&#13;
Evidence gathered from the industrial censuses of 1970 and 1975&#13;
suggest that, statewide, industrial employment growth is due primarily (56%)&#13;
to "mobile" components; i.e. births, branches, and transfers. Furthermore,&#13;
births explain about two-thirds of the mobile growth. Looking across cities,&#13;
it appears that rapidly growing areas recorded fast growth because of high net&#13;
stationary expansion and high birth rates; the contrary was found elsewhere.&#13;
This applies even when looking at non-traditional subsectors of industry&#13;
across cities.&#13;
These data were supplemented by others, drawn from a random sample&#13;
survey of 591 plants newly located in Sao Paulo state between 1977 and 1979.&#13;
Transfers and branches tend to locate in the vicinity of the previous plant or&#13;
headquarters, respectively. Thus 82% of branches and 51% of the transfers&#13;
never left the city of origin; only 13% of the branches and 23% of the&#13;
transfers moved more than 30 kilometers from the place of origin. Most of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xi-&#13;
these were city of Sao Paulo firms, suburbanizing or moving into more&#13;
peripheral locations. Of this small minority of jobs, virtually 80%-90% moved&#13;
no further-than 100 kilometers from Sao Paulo city. Beyond that all new&#13;
activity was overwhelmingly local in origin.&#13;
Taken together this suggests that it is crucial to shift from spatial&#13;
strategies based on long-distance relocation or branching incentives to&#13;
approaches that try to improve local conditions, per se.    Some of the ways&#13;
this can be done are apparent when one examines the factors that underlie&#13;
plant location decision-making.&#13;
The Links Between Urban Decentralized Development and Plant Location&#13;
Decisions in Sao Paulo&#13;
At the base of a system of cities lie individual economic agents&#13;
whose decisions jointly have a great impact of the fate of any one city. For&#13;
that reason it is interesting to explore the decisions of investors who must&#13;
decide on the location of a new plant, be it through relocation, branching, or&#13;
opening up an independent facility.&#13;
It is clear from interviews conducted with newly located firms in Sao&#13;
Paulo state that location decisions are rare in the life of a firm. For firms&#13;
already in existence, new locations generally are prompted by the need to&#13;
respond to other pressures -- to expand, to reorganize, or to enter into new&#13;
product lines. Some of the reasons behind suburbanization and exurbanization&#13;
include deteriorating conditions in the metropolitan center city, reflected by&#13;
rising land, labor, and congestion costs. Finally, new, independent plants&#13;
are forced to chose a location as one aspect of starting a business.&#13;
The search for a location is therefore part of a complex set of&#13;
decisions. Investors tend to find information on market signals and future&#13;
trends to be difficult to acquire and to interpret. Entrepreneurs with&#13;
existing business face transactions costs if they wish to move, while&#13;
management coordination problems are posed by branching. Births experience&#13;
the burden of start-up costs, which create cash-flow problems over the early&#13;
life of the enterprise.&#13;
The strategy most often identified by the survey to deal with these&#13;
problems is one of limited search. Generally, the location of existing&#13;
facilities or of the investors' residence is compared to only a few, well&#13;
known areas, which are usually close by. In this environment, similar&#13;
conditions prevail in many respects (proximity to known suppliers, proximity&#13;
to known labor suppliers) but land costs' road access to alternate markets,&#13;
the reliability or availability of particular utilities, and existence of&#13;
leasable space may differ. In addition, certain forms of "soft"&#13;
infrastructure (education, health, and recreational facilities) may vary to a&#13;
noticeable degree.    These differences are easier to evaluate, and trade-off&#13;
against one another, in the context of general area similarity.&#13;
Distant areas create the necessity for a more general evaluation of&#13;
factor markets. The survey suggests that recourse to widespread data&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xii -&#13;
collection and evaluation is foreign to most firms. Firms do, in fact, appear&#13;
to ignore unfamiliar territory unless they belong to that minority committed&#13;
to a major move. Given this, it is not surprising that hypothetical or actual&#13;
packages of municipal incentives do little to alter behavior. Even more hard-&#13;
headed municipal planning, which accelerates the pace at which utilities&#13;
arrive in to industries in a city, must cope with the disappointing fact that&#13;
perceptions change slowly, and that immediate "pay-offs" are unlikely.&#13;
From this, some policy advise results. First, the mobility that&#13;
helps modify location patterns at the margin seems to depend on generalized&#13;
regional growth pressures that are beyond the spatial planners perview.&#13;
Second, limited search procedures provide a proverbial silver lining to local&#13;
officials: business expansion and new, independent plant formation in&#13;
secondary cities takes place, in part, because more developed, historically&#13;
pre-eminent centers are not considered in the new location/ expansion&#13;
decision. Secondary city planners thus have some breathing room within which&#13;
to operate. They need to consider carefully what specific initiatives may&#13;
make sense.&#13;
Several options are not credible. Planners cannot do much to create&#13;
a dense urban network of services. They can do little to create localization&#13;
economies. They should abandon the use of municipal incentives as a means to&#13;
diversify their city's industrial profile, especially when focused on&#13;
unreceptive firms located beyond the immediate commuting shed of the area.&#13;
It is possible for local planners to exploit their role as "god-&#13;
fathers" of the business community with the sector line agencies operating at&#13;
the regional and, less persuasively, at the national level. Anything that&#13;
provides for the rapid, coordinated introduction of public services at the&#13;
local level is beneficial to local firms. Improved services at the local&#13;
level can also help attract critically important supplies of skilled labor&#13;
without which much potential decentralized development will be blocked.&#13;
Pressure at higher levels may be useful, in the long-run, in raising the&#13;
consciousness of authorities who deal with the disbursement of long-term&#13;
capital, pricing of agricultural commodities, regional transport investments,&#13;
and industrial promotion incentives. Finally, if local authorities wish to be&#13;
more creative, and can find the resources, they could bypass the popular&#13;
notion of industrial estates and work, instead, for ways to improve the avail-&#13;
ability of leased space in the community. Beyond that, the initiative must&#13;
pass to the national level, where many policy reforms could be undertaken to&#13;
nudge cities to a more efficient pattern of expansion.&#13;
National Policy-Induced Distortions: An Agenda for Reform&#13;
National initiatives to "improve" the mix of cities in a regional or&#13;
national system by specific spatial incentives is a poor substitute for&#13;
efficient policies across all sectors over which the government has some&#13;
impact. The best spatial policy consists of good sectoral policies.&#13;
Empirical demonstrations of this are harder to come by than other areas&#13;
discussed, both because the methodologies required are poorly developed and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xiii -&#13;
because the data requirements are large. Nevertheless limited research&#13;
findings and casual empiricism yield some suggestive results.&#13;
Non-spatial industrial promotion incentives favor larger, more&#13;
diversified centers and penalize secondary centers specializing in more&#13;
traditional lines of production. GSP, in particular, is rewarded, as are&#13;
nearby communities at the forefront of national industrial diversification.&#13;
Independent assessments, within and outside the Bank, suggests these policies&#13;
are undesirable on non-spatial efficiency grounds; they also dull market&#13;
signals implying new spatial patterns of employment. Those who argue that&#13;
such benefits will be offset by higher land values ignore the ability of a&#13;
metropolitan area to expand geographically. Those who argue that returns to&#13;
investors will fall back in an on-rush of inmigrating investors, ignore the&#13;
creation of new own-industry localization effects in larger cities, as well as&#13;
the impact of favoritism on the location decisions of the carriers of new&#13;
technology.&#13;
Beyond that, there is evidence that, because of insufficient local&#13;
autonomy in the field, spatial disparities exist between the value and the&#13;
cost of urban services provide, possibly leading to lower than expected wages&#13;
in favored, historically pre-eminent centers. This would not eliminate or&#13;
reverse wage differences between center and periphery; it would however, lead&#13;
to a less-steep wage gradient than would otherwise exist, especially if heavy&#13;
subsidization of large centers continues over a long period of time. It is&#13;
difficult to avoid the conclusion that centralized systems for determining&#13;
services and charges, combined with revenue sharing formulas heavily favoring&#13;
well-established industrial centers, works against the interests of secondary&#13;
centers. Reforming, or at least reconsidering, these policies would surely be&#13;
more cost effective than spatial initiatives such as those implemented in the&#13;
underdeveloped Northeast region of Brazil.&#13;
If decentralized development is difficult to foster, it may be, first&#13;
of all, because it is an irrelevant option given the particular stage of&#13;
economic development many regions are passing through. Even if this is not a&#13;
problem, far more fundamental reforms of sectoral policies are required than&#13;
most governments wish to undertake. Efficient decentralization will not occur&#13;
in an environment distorted by misplaced sectoral policies. In the final&#13;
analysis, local initiatives and isolated projects at the local level are&#13;
secondary in importance to national reforms.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
A. Background&#13;
In 1980, Sao Paulo state contained one-fifth of the 120 million&#13;
citizens of Brazil over a land area approximately equivalent to the Federal&#13;
Republic of Germany or the United Kingdom (see map 1). As an economic entity,&#13;
the state contributes approximately two-fifths of net domestic product,&#13;
including 60 percent of national manufacturing value-added. The per capita&#13;
income in Sao Paulo, at $4,000, is twice the national average. Greater Sao&#13;
Paulo (GPS), with 12.7 million people (1980) has half of the state population&#13;
and one-tenth of the national population. It has grown at an annual average&#13;
rate of 5.3 percent per annum over the last three decades, from a base of 2.7&#13;
million. GSP contributes one-quarter of net national product, and over 40&#13;
percent of Brazilian industrial value-added. Its per capita income now&#13;
exceeds $5,000.&#13;
The size and rapid growth of GSP has become a source of ill-defined&#13;
concern to local policy-makers. There are fears that this gigantic economic&#13;
machine is creating, at the margin, more management problems than are&#13;
Justified by the benefits of added growth. There is a feeling that some&#13;
resources presently lodged in GSP could be used more efficiently to strengthen&#13;
other urban centers of different sizes in other areas of the country. In&#13;
addition, the existence of GSP creates a potentially alarming concentration of&#13;
economic, and thus political, power in a few square kilometers of the national&#13;
territory and in the hands of a small fraction of the population. The case of&#13;
GSP is just one of many around the world. In almost all cases there is the&#13;
threat of public sector action to redirect growth forcibly so as to produce&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
greater spatial "balance". In some cases there are policies in place to&#13;
accomplish this goal.&#13;
The World Bank makes loans to these same countries, for urban&#13;
shelter, infrastructure, telecommunications, and transport projects. In the&#13;
past many of these investments were directed at the largest centers, without&#13;
much regard for the rest of the urban system. Now there is a growing effort&#13;
to promote secondary center development, partly to create future&#13;
countermagnets to the largest existing centers. 1/ In addition to this, the&#13;
Bank maintains an active dialogue with its borrower countries on urban&#13;
policies and institutional arrangements that bear on urban growth. The World&#13;
Bank is thus being drawn into discussions about policies aimed at restraining&#13;
the growth of major urban centers and/or promoting secondary centers. This&#13;
requires an understanding of the forces involved in urban growth across all&#13;
cities in a region or country, and of how policies might influence this&#13;
process. Over the past decade considerable resources have been devoted within&#13;
the Bank to review the analytical underpinnings of urban growth. 2/ The&#13;
present report is a continuation of that work.&#13;

B. The Legitimacy of Spatial Concerns&#13;
Does it really matter that most of the consumption and production in&#13;
a country takes place in a very few centers? The answer is a qualified&#13;
'yes".  It depends on a number of factors.  Concerns for political stability&#13;
and national security are legitimate reasons for introducing spatial equity&#13;
considerations into the elaboration of national development policies.&#13;
Furthermore, investors and workers may be operating within an economic&#13;
decision-making framework that emits distorted signals about the most&#13;
efficient pattern of future growth, whether sectoral or spatial dimensions are&#13;
considered. Correcting or counteracting such deficiencies is a legitimate&#13;
function of public policy, on purely efficiency grounds.&#13;
More specifically, fears exist that economic decision-makers face an&#13;
environment, across different sized cities, where many inputs may be&#13;
incorrectly priced. Thus, firms and workers in big cities contribute to the&#13;
creation of negative externalities such as pollution and congestion. Yet&#13;
these economic agents are rarely if ever taxed to pay for clean-up and for&#13;
decongestion projects; instead, massive investments of resources (paid for&#13;
largely by non-metropolitan dwellers) allow the big centers to continue to&#13;
experience low-cost growth in a tolerably pleasant environment.&#13;
Price signals aside, market forces may operate imperfectly. One&#13;
usually assumes, in arguing for laissez-faire attitudes on the part of public&#13;
officials, that decision-makers know most of their options. In truth, they&#13;
act with limited information. For example, investors in large cities appear&#13;
to know less about alternative investment options in other centers than would&#13;
be socially desirable. Even if an effort is made to explore other spatial&#13;
opportunities, the entrepreneur may face difficult-to-quantify or difficult-&#13;
to-forecast rewards and costs at different locations, forcing him back along&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
well-worn paths. This type of problem may perpetuate big city growth because&#13;
attractive alternatives are ignored, especially by the well-heeled carriers of&#13;
newer technology, sophisticated organizational techniques, and marketing know-&#13;
how. Generally ill-equipped and weakly capitalized local firms are left to&#13;
take up some of the slack at the hinterland locations; however, significant&#13;
opportunities may be bypassed for some indeterminate period of time.&#13;
Furthermore, economic agents may face an environment distorted by the&#13;
cumulative effects of public policies which deny different sectors and firms&#13;
of different sizes access, on reasonably equal terms, to resources with which&#13;
to respond to market signals. Similarly, economic agents in different&#13;
locations may be denied access on roughly equal terms to resources, over and&#13;
above the cited sector and size effects. This form of discrimination is&#13;
coupled with a tendency to deny secondary center administrators financing for&#13;
otherwise viable projects that could help promote local economic&#13;
development. Given these distortions, particular centers, usually the larger&#13;
ones, will be unduly blessed and grow faster than less favored areas.&#13;
Given the existence of such potential barriers to efficiency,&#13;
individuals may have a perfectly legitimate claim in demanding an opportunity&#13;
to participate in the development of national resources without having first&#13;
to migrate into a handful of urban centers. 1/ In fact, even if the cited&#13;
problems are not considered serious, there is still a case for having a&#13;
spatial perspective to public policy. The public sector has a right to plan&#13;
in anticipation of future patterns of comparative advantage, be they sectoral&#13;
or spatial. In this case, the transition period to more decentralized&#13;
patterns of growth can be shortened by making judicious investments and&#13;
I/ This presupposes a regional or national market large enough to support a&#13;
diverse set of cities of different sizes.&#13;

otherwise molding location behavior. This can help bring forward the&#13;
emergence of viable alternate centers for a wide spectrum of economic&#13;
activity.&#13;
C. Project in the Context of the Spatial Issues Research Agenda&#13;
There is no doubt that a great deal has yet to be learned about the&#13;
impact of public policy on the location of economic activity. The Bank has&#13;
invested additional resources to explore this question by funding a research&#13;
project aimed at understanding the trends in, and the behavioral underpinnings&#13;
of, urban growth across a region centered on a fast growing metropolis,&#13;
operating in the absence of explicit spatial policies. A focus on manu-&#13;
facturing firms was suggested by GSP's very high proportion of employment in&#13;
that sector (38 percent in 1978).   The working assumption was that, in the&#13;
system of cities under consideration, manufacturing held great potential for&#13;
expanding the economic base of these local centers. This assumption, in turn,&#13;
was based on the belief that manufacturing firms are relatively more flexible&#13;
than others in their choice of locations and mote likely to rank higher in&#13;
such measures as the generation of the local multiplier effects which&#13;
contribute to the growth and diversification of the different parts of the&#13;
urban economic system.&#13;
To mold spatial policies several factors must be understood. First,&#13;
the context in which policy-making might take place must be clear. The past&#13;
and present demographic and economic trends provide a background with which to&#13;
answer a series of questions: would policies work with or against the tide of&#13;
trends? How great is the "friction of space", given existing networks of&#13;
transportation and communications? What is the growth and sectoral&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
composition of economic activity, nationally and by small area? What is the&#13;
degree of "mobile" growth? Where are people and jobs going, at the margin?&#13;
An understanding of behavioral relationships implicit in locational&#13;
choices is also important. Do they confirm, in broad strokes, the forms&#13;
indicated by past research in the presently industrialized nations? Do they&#13;
imply important barriers to shifts in the existing patterns of employment and&#13;
population location? To this must be added a review of the institutional&#13;
setting through which public policy is transmitted. To what degree does the&#13;
public sector create a discriminatory environment that works against economic&#13;
agents who could foster different locational patterns of activity? How easily&#13;
can that environment be changed?&#13;
Finally, a choice of instruments for spatial policy implementation is&#13;
required. This calls for a full exploration of operational objectives. The&#13;
value of metropolitan restraint policies must be debated, and with it the&#13;
ability directly to determine "optimal" city size. Policy-makers must decide&#13;
on the value of secondary center promotion in the presence or absence of near-&#13;
term impacts on metropolitan growth. Some framework must be developed for&#13;
trading-off the possible losses in the level of total productivity per unit of&#13;
labor if the present patterns of spatial activity are forcibly transformed. A&#13;
decision must be reached as to the economic agents that are subject to such&#13;
instruments. If an industrial spatial policy is appropriate, should it be&#13;
geared to branches and transfers, births, and/or in situ expansions? Should&#13;
particular destination areas be fostered or discouraged by manipulating their&#13;
relative attractiveness?&#13;
Even after these issues are resolved, the type of instruments that&#13;
are acceptable must be determined. How does one measure the attractiveness of&#13;
instruments that rank differently on budgetary resource use, resource&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
allocation bias, administrative costs, or impact on aggregate economic&#13;
growth? This problem cannot be addressed successfully unless the impacts of&#13;
the instruments can be monitored accurately once in place; unfortunately, such&#13;
impact evaluation requires data and analytical methods which are not fully&#13;
developed at this time.&#13;
This research project concentrated on a selection of issues drawn&#13;
from the above listing. This summary, in turn, provides only selective&#13;
highlights of findings reported in greater depth in footnoted project papers;&#13;
it should not be considered a substitute for reading those reports. In Part&#13;
II a framework for understanding the development of an urban system is&#13;
discussed. In Part III, the evolution of the Sao Paulo urban system is&#13;
reviewed in light of the framework findings. Part IV outlines the project&#13;
findings on the degree to which agglomeration economies found in large cities&#13;
deter the emergence of newer, secondary centers. Part V explores the&#13;
relationship between the pattern of urban development and industrial plant&#13;
behavior. Part VI explores some policy distortions and their potential&#13;
effects on industrial location. Part VII provides some concluding&#13;
observations. The decision to conduct research in an areas where explicit&#13;
policy instruments are absent precluded research on their impact. This&#13;
omission is remedied, in part, by a research project, nearing completion, on&#13;
location behavior in the Greater Seoul (Korea) area. Finally, decisions made&#13;
at the time the project was conceived recognized the impossibility of devoting&#13;
much time or resources to cover issues whose understanding depended heavily on&#13;
institutional arrangements and bureaucratic behavior, including such subjects&#13;
as public investment decision-making and the operation of the banking&#13;
system. In a field as uncharted as this one it was unfortunate but inevitable&#13;
that only a few topics could be examined in depth.&#13;

II. A Framework for Understanding&#13;
the Development of a System of Cities&#13;
A. The Determinants of City Size&#13;
City size is the outcome of complex market forces and public policy&#13;
interactions which determine the distribution of sizes across an entire system&#13;
of cities. Any city competes over time with other cities for capital, labor,&#13;
and public investments under institutional constraints which govern access to&#13;
various inputs and outputs. Within this environment, cities attempt to move&#13;
toward their efficient size, given the costs associated with further growth&#13;
and the benefits these centers can offer additional households and&#13;
investors. In the long-run perspective provided by a model economy free of&#13;
distortions and imperfections, distributions of national output would be&#13;
associated with particular groups of cities of different sizes across the&#13;
national landscape. 1/ It follows, then, that in the less perfect real world,&#13;
improving the market environment within which national production decisions&#13;
are made will lead to a different configuration of cities. Conversely,&#13;
nudging the cities toward expansion paths more in line with efficient market&#13;
signals will tend to increase and change the composition of national output.&#13;
The existence of cities is based on the uneven distribution over&#13;
space of natural and manmade resources and on the uneven availability of&#13;
1/ The existing literature on the development of a system of cities is very&#13;
limited.  An early example can be found in J. Bergsman, P.Greenston, and&#13;
R. Healy, "A Classification of Economic Activities Based on Location&#13;
Pattern," Journal of Urban Economics 1975 (2), pp. 1-28. V. Henderson&#13;
developed the framework discussed here in Economic Theory and the Cities,&#13;
New York, Academic Press, 1977. This was extended to cover the developing&#13;
country context in V. Henderson, "A Framework for International&#13;
Comparisons of Systems of Cities," Washington, D.C., Urban and Regional&#13;
Economics Division, Report No. 80-3, Development Economics Department, The&#13;
World Bank, March 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
agglomeration, or clustering, economies in the production of goods and&#13;
services traded between communities. Such factors make it beneficial for&#13;
workers and firms to come together, despite the costs associated with density&#13;
(land and labor costs) and the costs associated with congestion and pollution.&#13;
Employment size, for any given city, will depend on the composition&#13;
of goods and services produced locally. Some commodities will be insensitive&#13;
to cost reductions linked to clustering; firms engaged in these subsectors&#13;
will abhor concentration in a few centers. Cities specializing in such goods&#13;
and services will have a relatively modest long-run equilibrium size. For&#13;
other commodities, the sensitivity to clustering will range from mild to very&#13;
high. If the mix of subsectors in a city is heavily weighted toward those&#13;
that are very responsive to the benefits of agglomeration, then that city will&#13;
have the potential to become very large.&#13;
Agglomeration economies could take the form of locational economies,&#13;
which, while external to firms, are internal to each industry grouping in a&#13;
particular city. These economies would reflect, among others, possibilities&#13;
for greater specialization among an industry's firms as industry size -&#13;
increases in an area; reduced cost in matching job categories with workers&#13;
specialized in that industry; and more rapid transmission of new technology.&#13;
Alternatively the agglomeration effects could be caused by urbanization&#13;
economies. Such economies are external to both firms and their individual&#13;
industries: they are the result of the overall level of economic activity in&#13;
a city. This would reflect the impact of such factors as a larger labor&#13;
market, a large business services sector, and economies associated with large&#13;
scale provision of public infrastructure inputs. In both instances, whether&#13;
localization or urbanization economies prevail, it is expected that firms in&#13;
different industries will show differing sensitivity to these external&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
economies. Because agglomeration economies are, at least in part, activity-&#13;
specific, most cities spontaneously specialize in what they produce. These&#13;
cities trade with one another and with the rest of the world. The ratio of&#13;
cities of any one type to any other is then a function of both the profile of&#13;
national production and of the ease with which locations can adapt to market&#13;
signals, competing with one another for the resources with which to expand.&#13;
There are limits to the degree to which urban areas can be expected&#13;
to specialize even in a developed country context when the fewest constraints&#13;
exist. At the most elementary level, it is costly to trade goods and services&#13;
across space, and, therefore, some commodities are provided more or less&#13;
ubiquitously. Beyond that, diversification may be explained by the use of a&#13;
matrix into which industrial activity can be classified (Figure 1)   On one&#13;
axis are activities which are sensitive to localization economies,&#13;
urbanization economies, or no agglomeration effects at all. On the other&#13;
axis, activities can be classified as resource-using (and thus constrained by&#13;
the location of such resources) or relatively footloose.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In the long term, one might have a series of scattered small or&#13;
medium sized urban areas specialized in the exploitation of some resource and&#13;
whose "core" firms are sensitive to localization economies. These "core"&#13;
activities might include primary metals, heavy machinery, wood products, or&#13;
food processing, for example. Because of the cost of intercity trade,&#13;
groupings of footloose activities, such as financial and business services and&#13;
some forms of manufacturing involving low resource content and/or high degrees&#13;
of technological sophistication, would tend to cluster around the pre-existing&#13;
centers. Among these footloose activities, some (publishing, apparel) may&#13;
also experience cost-cutting urbanization economies that encourage&#13;
concentration around large markets. At the limit one would get different&#13;
clusters of economic activity coming together to form a large multinucleated&#13;
metropolitan area. Even here there are limits to size, unless these are&#13;
somehow offset by market imperfections and distortions: there are increasing&#13;
costs to doing business or living in ever larger urban areas.&#13;
'-B. Urban Concentration, Deconcentration and Decentralization in&#13;
the Course of Regional Development&#13;
Given the outlined framework, it is useful to think further about the&#13;
evolution of a city system over time and across various stages of national or&#13;
regional economic development. At low levels of income, the development of&#13;
manufacturing activity is likely to be concentrated in relatively few urban&#13;
centers, except for the very simplest artisan and food processing.&#13;
activities. Those urban centers will have some priviledged resource, such as&#13;
port facilities; a strategic position along rail or road networks; and/or an&#13;
important political function. At such locations commercial and financial&#13;
services are relatively well developed and a concentration of purchasing power&#13;
exists. Given the limited size of the skilled labor pool, few locations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
outside big cities could hope to assemble a diversified labor market. Finally&#13;
industrial experience is so limited that firms seeking to maximize their&#13;
knowledge of markets and new technology will seek large centers. Thus at&#13;
early stages of development, most industries act as if urbanization economies&#13;
associated with sheer city size are crucial; city specialization is rare and&#13;
the intermediate city system suffers. Firms sensitive to agglomeration&#13;
economies of any type and footloose firms seeking compact market areas will&#13;
help to create one or two relatively large regional centers.&#13;
Even if each urban area had the right fully to exploit its potential&#13;
tax base, and even if they could compete on equal terms for funds a well-&#13;
developed capital market, it is likely that the few pre-eminent centers would&#13;
receive the lion's share of resources with which to develop physical and&#13;
social infrastructure during the earliest stages of industrialization. As it&#13;
is, these cities are usually subject to a centralized allocation of public&#13;
investment resources; national metropolitan areas tend to get a greater&#13;
overall share of these than a market solution might dictate. In either&#13;
instance, the strategy behind encouraging concentration is to create&#13;
industrial city states which can operate as a "nation" with only a fraction of&#13;
the additional telephones, paved roads, power plants, and educational&#13;
facilities needed to recreate a similar environment at multiple points in&#13;
space. Over time, infrastructure constraints are likely to be relaxed. The&#13;
market for manufactured goods in the region will grow in size and the range of&#13;
goods that can be produced in decentralized locations at competitive prices&#13;
will increase. All other things being equal, some firms performing relatively&#13;
standardized tasks with relatively "mature" technology may be interested in&#13;
locations in the urban periphery, since the rising factor costs in larger&#13;
centers (land, labor, congestion) no longer make the level of big city&#13;
agglomeration economies as attractive as they were initially.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Unfortunately these peripheral centers may not be equipped to receive&#13;
transfers or branches, or to nurture new firms. This is because the&#13;
alternatives must be capable of generating a threshold level of agglomeration&#13;
economies, social overhead capital, entrepreneurs, labor with diferent skills,&#13;
and capital flows.   In the absence of "adequately,equipped" secondary centers,&#13;
the threshold problem may allow a large urban cluster to have declining&#13;
marginal net benefits from certain forms of additional economic activity and&#13;
yet remain more attractive to producers and to recipients of factor payment&#13;
than competing alternatives. This dilemma is likely to be resolved, in&#13;
practice, either by deconcentration into a metropolitan region or by the slow&#13;
independent emergence of more distant large centers.&#13;
These regional metropolitan areas are likely to grow, and to receive&#13;
public resources with which to cope with growth, because the propulsive local&#13;
activity is important from a national, sectoral point of view. Included among&#13;
those types of cities are the ports through which agricultural and mining&#13;
products flow overseas, as well as major mining or agricultural service and&#13;
processing centers. These cities are likely to depend on local entrepreneur-&#13;
ship, given the evidence on location patterns discussed below. In a sense it&#13;
is the very difficulty that the metropolitan entrepreneur has in appropriating&#13;
this distant source of activity that guarantees the ability of hinterland&#13;
development.&#13;
Deconcentration is a much more predictable outcome. It appears&#13;
inevitably in the course of regional developmaent because the advantages of&#13;
proximity to central city services and markets can be preserved while some of&#13;
the disadvantages (land costs) can be sharply reduced. If one posits a model&#13;
that stresses risk-averse behavior by firm managers in the presence of&#13;
uncertainty about present conditions and future trends, then deconcentration&#13;
should be the main way that historically pre-eminent centers transmit growth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
to the periphery and relieve the managerial pressures of rapid urbanization.&#13;
It permits urban areas originally distant from the core gradually to become&#13;
incorporated into the process of modern economic growth.&#13;
Ideally, as resources become more abundant, the public sector might&#13;
anticipate future spatial patterns of comparative advantage by shifting&#13;
resources toward the periphery generally or by providing additional resources&#13;
to intermediate, secondary centers where the rate of return on infrastructure&#13;
investments includes a modest "infant city" premium. The premium would allow&#13;
public investment analysts to recompute the social rate of return from these&#13;
projects to include a margin for bringing forward the emergence of viable&#13;
alternative locations for a wide spectrum of activities. Planning is rarely&#13;
so systematic but, with economic development infrastructure is nevertheless&#13;
extended over wider and wider areas. With due regard to lags in&#13;
entrepreneurial perception of improved infrastructure -- once new facilities&#13;
are in place -- it eventually becomes apparent to decision-makers that an&#13;
increasing number of centers are ready to accept a diversified portfolio of&#13;
industrial activity. The question then arises whether smaller population&#13;
centers are actually able to generate the combination of relatively low factor&#13;
costs and sufficient agglomeration economies to compete with larger, more&#13;
established urban areas. In addition, it is unclear whether local&#13;
entrepreneurs, acting alone, are adequate substitutes for the dynamism&#13;
provided by metropolitan entrepreneurs, acting through branches and transfers,&#13;
and presumed to have at least on initial advantage in knowledge about&#13;
technology, plant management, and marketing. The history of urban growth in&#13;
the more developed countries suggests that, with lags of uncertain duration,&#13;
these problems can be overcome.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
C. Public Policy Implications of Framework&#13;
The system of cities literature contains lessons for public policy&#13;
makers. The abstract beauty of the concept of efficient city size or&#13;
efficient city size distribution does not support the notion of using "optimal&#13;
geography" as a policy objective. Given the type of data and analytical tools&#13;
available, "optimal size" estimates for a city at any one point in time can&#13;
vary by a factor of two or three if the estimated determinants-of-size&#13;
parameters differ from their (unknown) true values by 20 or 25 percent. It&#13;
makes sense, however, to implement policies that nudge centers toward their&#13;
potential size, whatever that might be, by improving the performance of the&#13;
market.&#13;
More specifically, one can act to force agents to absorb the full&#13;
burden of externalities like congestion and pollution by instituting user&#13;
charges which can be used to finance socially appropriate local investments.&#13;
This will produce efficient levels of congestion and pollution and firm-level&#13;
planning that takes the associated costs into account. In addition, one can&#13;
act to improve the mobilization and distribution of resources for social&#13;
overhead capital, so that more centers have an opportunity to bid for grants&#13;
loans, and expand in response to market signals. This is particularly&#13;
appropriate for the metropolitan periphery, which is likely to emerge at an&#13;
earlier stage than most secondary centers. Attempts to fight deconcentration&#13;
in the name of controlling "sprawl," on the other hand, would seem conter-&#13;
productive.&#13;
One can also act to reconsider those national economic promotion&#13;
policies which provide differential access to public sector favors,&#13;
discriminating by type of activity, firm size, and location. It should be&#13;
stressed, in this regard, that even if explicit spatial discrimination is&#13;
absent, and access to incentives for any given activity or firm size is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
everywhere the same, the differing activity and firm size profiles of cities&#13;
may still create indirect effects if, for example, very sophisticated sectors&#13;
and very large firms -- which are found in few centers -- are treated&#13;
preferentially. The primary goal here should be sectoral efficiency, broadly&#13;
speaking. Eliminating sectoral distortions may do more for decentralized&#13;
development than all the myriad spatial efforts conventionally proposed by&#13;
Third World policy-makers.&#13;
Finally, should location behavior research uncover evidence that&#13;
entrepreneurs find it very costly to assemble information on base data and&#13;
market trends in centers other than those that are historically pre-eminent,&#13;
it may make sense for the public sector to invest some resources in&#13;
information gathering and dissemination. Such investments could be justified&#13;
by assuming that the are social benefits to more efficient location decision-&#13;
making, benefits which are not captured by individual firms. This holds true&#13;
even if it becomes apparent that the only outcome is to accelerate&#13;
deconcentration and intermediate distance (100-150 kilometers) transmission of&#13;
growth impulses from the metropolis, with no discernible impact on more&#13;
distant secondary centers. Given the nature of city system evolution,&#13;
efficient deconcentration and the development of nearby centers is a crucial&#13;
precursor to more generalized decentralized development.&#13;

The framework developed in Part II can be used in several ways.&#13;
First, it can provide useful background for understanding the historical&#13;

development of the urban system in a region or a country. Second, it can help&#13;
place recent trends in perspective, broadening the implications of and&#13;
providing the links between secondary data powers. Finally, it provides some&#13;
propositions which can be subject to more rigorous testing. For&#13;
organizational purposes, the first two applications are discussed in this&#13;
section, while an empirical exercise on the nature of agglomeration economies&#13;
and the public policy implications of such findings are discussed in Part IV.&#13;
B. Polarization in Historical Perspective 1/&#13;
Around 1900, Brazil was an economic archipelago, a series of small&#13;
regional economies with limited links to one another. Each region had its own&#13;
agricultural, industrial, and service base, and each possessed an associated&#13;
system of cities. The motive force behind the expansion of any region was&#13;
exports: on this foundation, other development blocks fell into place.&#13;
Sao Paulo city and its hinterland, largely contained within Sao Paulo&#13;
state, was a region that had the opportunity to benefit from an export drive&#13;
which was special in many respects: it was more sustained than any other&#13;
experienced by the various Brazilian regions: it was labor-intensive and&#13;
based on wage labor, thus creating a monetarized local market; and it was high&#13;
valued with respect to land, thus returning, on average, substantial profits&#13;
per hectare. The existence of this export base placed Sao Paulo city and its&#13;

environs at the forefront of Brazilian industrialization; employment rose from&#13;
10 percent to 27 percent of the national industrial total during the first&#13;
half of this century. This industrial growth, along with the employment&#13;
created by business services catering to industry and local agriculture,&#13;
helped swell local populations within the later metropolitan boundaries from&#13;
240,000 in 1900 to 2.7 million in 1950.&#13;
Coffee arrived in Sao Paulo state in the 1850s and spread across the&#13;
whole state during the following thirty years. Sao Paulo city was positioned&#13;
to draw virtually all the benefits of the regional port, 1/ including those of&#13;
being the political, financial and business services center of the state. The&#13;
requirements of coffee production and distribution, and the incomes derived&#13;
from coffee, generated activities that were useful to industrial growth.&#13;
Among these were the following:&#13;
a) local production of goods and services to process, ship, and&#13;
finance coffee;&#13;
b) local production of goods and services for the local market&#13;
created by coffee incomes, given high interregional and&#13;
international shipping costs;&#13;
c) agricultural production in the newly-exploited hinterland areas&#13;
to meet regional needs for food and industrial raw materials&#13;
given fertile soils, ever improving intra-regional transport&#13;
facilities, and poor interregional links except by sea;&#13;
d) attraction of millions of European immigrants, whose education&#13;
and skills enhanced local human capital;&#13;
1/ This occurred even though the docks were located elsewhere, in Santos.&#13;
The port itself was physically hemmed-in, located in disease-ridden&#13;
lowlands, and isolated from the rest of the state by an escarpment.&#13;
Sao Paulo city was linked to the port directly and thus dominated all&#13;
access to Santos by land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
e) resources for investment in coffee-related and other activities,&#13;
given weak interregional capital mobility; and&#13;
f) resources and local revenues with which to supplement or&#13;
subsidize foreign investments in infrastructure in ports,&#13;
transport links, and urban public utilities.&#13;
The public sector played a significant role in this process. The&#13;
central government's reliance on customs revenues led to increasingly&#13;
protectionist tariffs that sheltered local production of non-durable consumer&#13;
goods, in particular. A decentralized system of intergovernmental fiscal&#13;
relations allowed Sao Paulo state to have exclusive access to taxes placed on&#13;
coffee exports:  this permitted the state to control an independently-funded&#13;
budget equal to roughly 35 to 40 percent of the national budget. These funds,&#13;
combined at times with central resources, were applied to-ventures that&#13;
promoted economic development in Sao Paulo state and thus in Sao Paulo city.&#13;
Among the most prominent examples, one can cite the use of subsidies to&#13;
encourage the construction of railroads and ports; the use of public funds for&#13;
the same purpose; the subsidization of European immigrant travel and&#13;
subsistence expenses (almost exclusively centered on attracting workers to Sao&#13;
Paulo state); and the establishment of schemes, backed by guaranteed foreign&#13;
loans, to maintain the local currency earnings of coffee producers in the face&#13;
of international price fluctuations.&#13;
Rio de Janeiro, the nation's capital and main rival to Sao Paulo,&#13;
also benefitted from the largesse of the public sector. Yet Rio lost the race&#13;
for industrial pre-eminence by 1920, handicapped by the lack of a rapidly&#13;
growing captive hinterland; its poor potential for agricultural production was&#13;
matched by the rapid exhaustion of its coffee soils, leaving much of the&#13;
hinterland population dependent on subsistence agriculture for a living. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
nature of domestic industrial production at the time and existing transport&#13;
and communications barriers made access to resources and markets more critical&#13;
than-pre-existing levels of clustering economies. In this environment, Sao&#13;
Paulo city was able to overcome the disadvantages of a later start in the&#13;
process of industrialization. When the era of more sophisticated domestic&#13;
industrial production arrived, Sao Paulo city (and its associated urban areas)&#13;
was far ahead of all competing centers in market size and in employment in&#13;
most industrial sectors. The rest of the country was still undeveloped or&#13;
incapable of generating or substituting for a prolonged export boom. So Sao&#13;
Paulo, city and state, continued to grow, drawing on firm-specific central&#13;
government subsidies for new sector development, benefitting from central and&#13;
state government measures to preserve coffee sector earnings, building its&#13;
industry behind import-restricting efforts meant to husband foreign exchange,&#13;
and conquering extra-regional markets as transportation barriers decreased.&#13;
As industry and as agriculture prospered in Sao Paulo, barriers to interstate&#13;
capital flows encouraged local reinvestment, while the volume of activity&#13;
began attracting significant foreign investment.&#13;
Over the period 1950 to 1980, 1/ there was a forcible transformation&#13;
in local production from an emphasis on consumer non-durables to a concen-&#13;
tration on consumer durables, intermediate goods, and capital goods. The&#13;
central government introduced an ever-larger number of industrial promotion&#13;
instruments -- including trade protection and preferential access to long-term&#13;
capital -- to compensate for the relatively high costs of production. Using&#13;
the same logic, it initially chose to limit expenditures on supporting&#13;

- 21 -&#13;
infrastructural investments to areas like Sao Paulo city and Rio. 1/ in&#13;
effect, Sao Paulo city and its environs became an industrial city st.ate. Once&#13;
again, as in the earlier period, a decentralized fiscal system gave Sao Paulo&#13;
state control of resources equivalent to a third or more of national govern-&#13;
ment revenues, resources which were plowed back into state infrastructure,&#13;
with priority to serving GSP. As a result, GSP grew in population from 2.7&#13;
million to 12.7 million (1950-1980) and its inausrriai employment increased&#13;
from 600,000 jobs to 1,461,000 jobs over the same period.&#13;
Central government programs between 1950 and 1964 acted decisively to&#13;
build up industry in GSP, the local establishment of the Brazilian motor&#13;
vehicles industry being a good example. Industrial promotion efforts, uneven&#13;
in their sectoral orientation, had long-term effects that went well beyond the&#13;
individual plants involved: the area increased its network of suppliers and-&#13;
business services, upgraded the skills-of its labor force through on-the-job&#13;
training, and, partly as a consequence, became a beacon for foreign investors&#13;
arriving in Brazil.&#13;
After 1964 public policy began to have a somewhat different impact on&#13;
the spatial organization of activity. A relentless pace of industrial growth&#13;
was maintained over a number of years, pushing many GSP producers to the&#13;
limits of their plant capacity at a time when the liabilities of producing&#13;
locally were made clearer (high nominal wages, high land costs, increased&#13;
congestion and pollution). This encouraged short-distance relocations from-&#13;
Sao Paulo city and its inner suburbs. This industrial growth also promoted&#13;
additional development in suburban and exurban locations, helping to build the&#13;
1/ Belo Horizonte, capital of the aptly named state of Minas Gerais (General&#13;
Mines), itself adjacent to Sao Paulo and Rio states, was an exception that&#13;
proves the rule. Its metallurgical potential, which could be put to good&#13;
use serving the industrial centers, made it a logical candidate for public&#13;
investments that would otherwise be absent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
industrial base of communities that were relatively far (100-150 kilometers)&#13;
from downtown Sao Paulo city. Simultaneously decentralized development took&#13;
place at an accelerated rhythm in other regions, especially the regional&#13;
metropolitan areas. All this was accompanied by massive state and federal&#13;
investments in infrastructure upgrading across a wider area than in the past;&#13;
by 1975 the worst constraints to locations in the periphery of the Sao Paulo&#13;
system and in the larger cities of the country had been overcome. Sectoral&#13;
programs for new natural resource exploitation and the "liberation" of&#13;
agriculture through improved price incentives and generous credit subsidies&#13;
opened new possibilities for associated, more decentralized industrial&#13;
growth. Finally, programs with a specific spatial bent were introduced, most&#13;
notably in the subsidization of industrial development in the states of&#13;
Northeast Brazil (see Section VI) and of commercial and industrial&#13;
diversification in Manaus, on the Amazon.&#13;
Even during this last period, other institutional arrangements worked&#13;
to perpetuate the pre-eminence of GSP. In spite of tax system reforms, the&#13;
fiscal system forced states and localities to rely heavily on the proceeds on&#13;
an industrial value-added tax collected at the point of origin, while&#13;
providing for only limited revenue redistribution. This gave GSP the&#13;
wherewithal to "tend its own garden", while providing state resources to&#13;
create a privileged hinterland. As a result deconcentration was encouraged&#13;
more forcefully than widespread decentralized development. In addition, key&#13;
development institutions -- like the subsidies-granting Industrial Development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Council and the National Development Bank 1/ -- ignored space except as a&#13;
consequence of narrow sectoral promotion policies.&#13;
What is occurring in urban Brazil today is a slow rearrangement of&#13;
activity in space given the workings of market signals and of primarily&#13;
sectoral policies.With lags of different lengths, firms are responding to the&#13;
release of constraints in secondary centers outside GSP. In an environment&#13;
such as this, dramatic changes are unlikely to occur in short order. In&#13;
particular, the gains GSP experienced over many decades will not be dissipated&#13;
easily.&#13;
C. The Emergence of Deconcentration and Limited Decentralized&#13;
Development 2/&#13;
Even though urban population growth has fallen over time, it is still&#13;
considerably higher than total population growth; 3/ fully half of Brazil's&#13;
1/ The Council provided deep subsidies for as much as 3/4 of new&#13;
manufacturing investment during the "miracle growth" years (1968-1973);&#13;
Sao Paulo state (and GSP, by implication, with 7 out of 10 industrial jobs&#13;
in the state) received half the subsidized investment. The Bank was more&#13;
selective in its choice of sectoral programs and more cognizant of Sao&#13;
Paulo's alternate sources of medium- and long- term financing (reinvested&#13;
profits, foreign credit, local banking). Nevertheless, Sao Paulo received&#13;
40 to 50% of its resources before 1970 and 30-40% thereafter through 1975.&#13;
2/ This issue has received limited attention except at the conceptual&#13;
level. The section draws upon findings reported in P. Townroe and&#13;

3/ During the decade of the 1950s, urban growth averaged 5.6%. By the 1970s,&#13;
it had fallen to 4.4% per year. Total population growth declined from&#13;
3.0% to 2.5% per annum.&#13;

- 24 -&#13;
population now lives in centers with 20,000 or more persons in 1970. Greater&#13;
Sao Paulo's share of population has stabilized at 21 percent. Greater Rio has&#13;
grown at relatively slow rates over the last three decades and now holds 15&#13;
percent of national population. Sixteen large agglomerations (with 250,000&#13;
population or more in 1970) hold another third of the urban inhabitants, while&#13;
smaller centers contain the remaining third. Though GSP set the standard for&#13;
urban growth in the 1950s and, to a lesser extent the 1960s, during the last&#13;
decade the growth rates of all other size categories (except Rio) have&#13;
surpassed that of the largest metropolis, which increased at the national&#13;
urban average.&#13;
Within Sao Paulo state, areas radiating from GSP, along the road axes&#13;
to Rio and to points west, especially those within 150 kilometers, have shown&#13;
great dynamism over the last decade. By 1980 the urban population growth of&#13;
state urban areas outside GSP exceeded those of the metropolis; 1/ it was led&#13;
by ten centers which, in 1970, had populations in excess of 100,000 persons.&#13;
This change in relative growth ranks is being helped by trends in&#13;
industrial employment growth. Nationally, during 1970-1975, the growth rate&#13;
in urban manufacturing (7.1% per annum) was exceeded by most city size classes&#13;
outside Greater Sao Paulo (6.5%) and Greater Rio (3.9%). This pattern&#13;
recurred between 1975-1980. 2/ Slowly, the overwhelming share of&#13;
manufacturing employment located in Greater Sao Paulo and Greater Rio is&#13;
falling, from nearly 60% in 1950 to 47% in 1980. The largest agglomerations,&#13;
1/ These trends should not shift attention away from the large absolute&#13;
population growth in GSP. It gained 4.4 million inhabitants between 1970&#13;
and 1980.&#13;
2/ Between 1975-1980, total urban industrial employment rose at a rate of&#13;
4.3%, while GSP grew at 3.4% and Greater Rio increased at 1.5%.&#13;

with 250,000 or more inhabitants in 1970, now contain roughly 22X of the jobs;&#13;
while medium-sized and smaller centers contain about 31% of employment.&#13;
In Sao Paulo state, manufacturing growth in all secondary city size&#13;
classes now exceeds the rate in GSP. This trend emerged prior to the reversal&#13;
of population growth rankings and had continued since. If shift-share&#13;
analysis is-used to separate industrial growth into its component parts, 1/ it&#13;
is apparent that secondary city growth at rates above the state average is not&#13;
attributable to the fact that its mix of industries are "fast growers" at the&#13;
statewide level; the reverse is, in fact, true. Instead, there is a&#13;
significant, positive residual growth, which implies a swing away from the&#13;
metropolitan area in the balance of comparative advantage for a wide range of&#13;
industries. This is true for both 1960-1970 and for 1970-1975, using either&#13;
employment or value-added data. 2/&#13;
These results are reinforced by information available on value-added&#13;
per worker, expressed in constant cruzeiros. At a two-digit level of&#13;
disaggregation, areas outside GSP have undergone a transformation which has&#13;
brought the hinterland into a position of increasing parity with the&#13;
1/ Growth is mechanically disaggregated into three components: a) growth that&#13;
would have been recorded in an area that had increased employment (or&#13;
value-added) at the average state growth rate for all industry;&#13;
b) additional growth which is attributable to the particular mix of&#13;
industries in the area and is calculated by subtracting (a) from the&#13;
employment expected if each sector in an area had grown at its state&#13;
average rate, be that higher or lower than the all industry average; and&#13;
c) a residual "differential shift" growth which remains unexplained after&#13;
considering the impact of (a) plus (b). The use of shift share analysis&#13;
is rare in the developing country context, though the methodology itself&#13;
is quite conventional; see B. Stevens and C. Moore, "A Critical Review of&#13;
the Literature on Shift-Share Analysis as a Forecasting Technique",&#13;
Journal of Regional Science, 20, pp. 419-437. The data is reviewed in P.&#13;

metropolis; disparities in value-added per worker over space are diminishing&#13;
or disappearing. Spatial disaggregation of the results suggests this&#13;
convergence is being led by sectors located in cities and agglomerations with&#13;
1970 populations of over 100,000. However, western Sao Paulo, beyond the&#13;
Inner Ring reaching out to 150 kilometers from "downtown" Sao Paulo city,&#13;
still continues to lag considerably behind the more developed eastern portion&#13;
of the state. 1/&#13;
In addition, there is evidence that the increasing competitiveness of&#13;
non-GSP locations is associated with a systematic convergence in sub-regional&#13;
profiles of industrial production. As late as 1960, non-GSP locations tended&#13;
to concentrate their employment in traditional activities, particularly food&#13;
processing and textiles. Roughly speaking, 40% of non-GSP employment was&#13;
occupied in these relatively simple- technology sectors compared with 25% in&#13;
GSP. By 1975, the metropolitan share of traditional employment (15 %) was&#13;
more similar to that found elsewhere (circa 25%). Corresponding to this,&#13;
there has been a rise in employment shares devoted to more sophisticated&#13;
activities, such as engineering and consumer durables, across Sao Paulo&#13;
state. 2/&#13;
Finally, it is apparent, on the basis of special tabulations prepared&#13;
by the Brazilian census bureau, that the increasing competitiveness of non-&#13;
metropolitan centers cannot be attributed primarily to a simple transfer of&#13;

Procedures and Manufacturing Location Behavior...", op. cit.&#13;
2/ The share of machinery, electrical-communications equipment and transport&#13;
equipment was 21% in 1960, while other subregions' proportions hovered&#13;
around 10%. By 1975, the GSP share had risen to 31%, while elsewhere the&#13;
proportion varied around an average of about 25%.&#13;

economic activity from GSP. 1/ Sub-regional industrial growth between 1970&#13;
and 1975 was classified according to employment generated by each of four firm&#13;
tenure types: net stationary expansion, births, new branches, and transfers. 2/&#13;
During the period in question, when overall job growth exceeded 40%, more than&#13;
half (56%) was attributable to "mobile" growth unrelated to stationary&#13;
expansion. This was the case across all sub-regions of the state except in&#13;
the inner metropolitan suburbs. Among the sources of this mobile employment&#13;
growth, births account for about two-thirds of the total, while branches and&#13;
transfers shared the rest.&#13;
The portion of activity over which GSP could have had a direct hand&#13;
in generating is therefore limited. This hypothesis has received additional&#13;
support as a result of an exhaustive review of the location and size of all&#13;
non-GSP branch plants belonging to firms headquartered in metropolitan Sao&#13;
Paulo. 3/ In 1975, these branch plants generated 186,000 jobs across Brazil.&#13;
Half of this employment was located within 150 kilometers from the metropolis,&#13;

region's industrial jobs. 1/&#13;
In summary, looking across urban areas, those centers growing rapidly&#13;
recorded high rates of net stationary expansion plus relatively rapid growth&#13;
in employment generated by births. Slow growing areas tended to be weak&#13;
across the board. Looking across sectors, it is apparent that net stationary&#13;
expansion and births were responsible for most of the increase in activity&#13;
even in unexpected cases, such as the fast growing engineering goods sectors&#13;
in the hinterland.&#13;
Though these results may strike some as counter-intuitive, they are&#13;
duplicated by the few studies done on the subject in the developed world: 2/&#13;
long-distance transfers and branching rarely account for a large fraction of&#13;
destination area growth. The policy implication is everywhere the same, as&#13;
well: decentralized development, as opposed to deconcentration across&#13;
metropolitan borders, appears to depend on local initiative 3/ rather than on&#13;
dynamism transfetred from a major metropolis. The conclusions of an&#13;
industrial location survey, detailed below, suggest that this result is tied&#13;
closely to the risk-averse, conservative nature of locational decision-&#13;
making: all but the most familiar nearby alternative sites tend to be&#13;
rejected out of hand. Whatever the cause, the primary role played by local&#13;
entrepreneurs in secondary centers suggests that improving conditions in the&#13;

IV. Behind'the Trends:   Do Big City, Agglomeration Economies&#13;
Create a Barrier to Secondary Center Development?-&#13;
A. Background&#13;
Evidence in Part III suggests that Sao'Paulo is experiencing the&#13;
initial stages of vigorous decentralized industrial and urban',development.&#13;
The framework presented earlier, when interpreted.-in historical perspective,&#13;
-suggests that decentralized development is associated with large,.well-&#13;
developed regional:economies. Yet the Third World policy-maker is often&#13;
convinced that the sheer size of the.pre-eminent center creates an insuperable&#13;
barrier to widespread decentralized development,.because population size is&#13;
supposed to confer significant cost.savings to all sectors in'the form of--&#13;
agglomeration economies, and because these- axiegea savings are assumed hot to.&#13;
be easily offset byerising factor costs (land,--labor,.congestion).,in.the self-&#13;
same center., Data analyzed by the research team sheds light on this issue and&#13;
suggests that the.widespread decentralized development found in developed&#13;
countries is not independent of the sp.ecific way in which agglomeration&#13;
economies come into play, and can be replicated elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;

B. The Role of Scale Economies in Shaping Location Decisions 1/&#13;
As noted earlier, urban economies of scale are either caused by&#13;
localization effects, proxied by own industry size, or by urbanization&#13;
effects, proxied by city size. Why should one bother to differentiate?&#13;
Because if localization economies predominate, then the scale effect is&#13;
created by urban area specialization in particular clusters of traded goods&#13;
and not by the undifferentiated massing of all production. The presence of&#13;
strong localization economies would also suggest that the existence of a full&#13;
complement of industries in the largest urban areas, with each industry&#13;
exposed to the costs of massive clustering, may be caused by market&#13;
distortions or imperfections.&#13;
To test this, demographic and industrial census data was obtained for&#13;
126 urban areas with 1970 populations of 20,000 or more and located across all&#13;
of the South-Southeast region of Brazil. This area is larger than France,&#13;
Spain, and pre-war Germany, combined. The first evidence that localization&#13;
economies are at work is found in the degree of specialization of urban&#13;
areas. Excluding agricultural service centers (where wholesaling,&#13;
warehousing, and transport services are important) and large metropolitan&#13;
areas, the urban areas typically have roughly 20% of their labor force in one&#13;
1/ Empirical work outside the U.S. is negligible. Existing U.S. studies are&#13;
limited by the use of very restrictive computation techniques and/or&#13;
excessively aggregated data. See, among others, G. Carlino, Economies of&#13;
Scale in Manufacturing Location. Theory and Measurement, Leiden, The&#13;
Netherlands, Martinus-Nijhoff, 1978; and L. Sveikauskas, "The Productivity&#13;
of Cities", Quarterly Journal of Economics, 89, 393-413. This section is&#13;
based upon V. Henderson, "Urban Economies of Scale in Brazil", Washington,&#13;
D.C., Urban Development Department Discussion Paper, Report No. 17, The&#13;
World Bank, November 1982. It is supplemented by information in V.&#13;

three- or four- digit manufacturing activity. 1/ One should keep in mind that&#13;
anything beyond 20% reflects an extraordinarily narrow city economic base,&#13;
since the bulk of local employment will always be in goods and services that&#13;
are not traded between communities, including local government, housing, and&#13;
retail and personal service.&#13;
Further confirmation of locational economies can be found in work&#13;
that regressed a sector's value-added per worker in an urban area against own&#13;
industry employment, city size, average labor force quality (age, education),&#13;
average firm size, distance from the nearest port, and the sector's capital-&#13;
labor ratio in that city. The analysis finds almost no evidence of urban-&#13;
ization economies at work except for the printing and publishing sector. 2/&#13;
In contrast, there is strong evidence of localization economies associated&#13;
with own industry size. Except for printing and publishing, all coefficients&#13;
have the correct sign and most of the coefficients are significant at some&#13;
reasonable level. These localization effects are large. Median employment&#13;
1/ About half of the 126 urban areas in the sample were classified as being&#13;
primarily specialized in production of locally exported manufactured&#13;
goods. Twenty-two urban areas specialized in textiles (mostly spinning&#13;
and weaving), one in leather (shoes), six in iron and steel, ten in food&#13;
processing (sugar and meat packing), five in non-metallic minerals (mostly&#13;
ceramics), two in pulp and paper, two in transport equipment, one in&#13;
chemicals, one in beverages, and two in non-electrical machinery.&#13;
Specialized urban areas have anywhere from 9-49% of their labor force in&#13;
just one usually three- or four-digit sub-industry, with a typical&#13;
concentration of about 20%. In addition, there are eight large&#13;
multinucleated areas producing a whole range of products and 10 other&#13;
large urban areas which are somewhat diversified. There are over 30 other&#13;
urban areas which should be classified as the agricultural service centers&#13;
of a central place model. Their employment tends to be in warehousing and&#13;
transportation, wholesaling, and some food processing. Finally, there are&#13;
upwards of 10 urban areas with high concentrations of state and federal&#13;
government employees including defense workers.&#13;
2/ Weak evidence also exists of urbanization economies for non-metallic&#13;
minerals and furniture. For other industries, sign patterns are mixed and&#13;
coefficients hover near zero.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
across these urban areas for most industries in the sample falls into the 350-&#13;
500 range, except for iron and steel, and textiles, where it is around 900.&#13;
Evaluating the coefficients at the median industry size range suggests that a&#13;
10% increase in own industry employment in a city raises firm output in that&#13;
sector by 1%, without any changes in inputs used. It appears that, as an&#13;
industry's size in a city increases, localization economies fail to keep pace; 1/&#13;
as industry size approaches 2,000 employees, a 10% increase in own industry&#13;
size yields only a half a percent increase firm output, all other things being&#13;
equal. By the time sector size reaches 5,000, the scale benefits of&#13;
additional sector size begin to vanish.&#13;
Examination of U.S. data, using similar techniques, yields roughly&#13;
similar conclusions, 2/ though the mix of sectors examined is somewhat&#13;
different because of fewer sample size constraints. Localization economies&#13;

2/ Results are discussed in V. Henderson, "Efficiency of Resource Usage and&#13;
City Sizes", op. cit.&#13;
3/ The weakness of the textiles sector locational scale economies in the U.S.&#13;
appear linked to the fact that textile work is dominant in cities where it&#13;
appears, thereby "contaminating" the explanatory variables, which are no&#13;
longer independent but endogenously determined. The use of two-stage&#13;
least-squares techniques, using instrument variables as a corrective, was&#13;
applied to the U.S. data and had the effect of substantially improving the&#13;
case for locational scale effects in the textile sector. Other factors&#13;
may also be at work in the U.S. data, including the arbitrary exclusion of&#13;
employment in certain cities for confidentiality purposes and the&#13;
potentially more hetereogeneous nature of products and technology listed&#13;
under any one industry sub-sector heading.&#13;

minerals has significant, positive urbanization effects. For the remaining&#13;
industries, urbanization effects register a mix of positive and negative&#13;
coefficients values, and the estimates tend to hover around zero. 1/&#13;
It is important to note that localization effects are strongest in&#13;
those industries in which urban areas tend to specialize. In Brazil, for&#13;
example, they are weakest in industries such as printing, apparel, and&#13;
furniture, in which no cities specialize. This type of relationship is also&#13;
apparent from the U.S. data. The largest difference in the degree of economic&#13;
specialization between developed urban systems, such as those found in the&#13;
U.S., and those found in South-Southeast Brazil is at the level of the very&#13;
largest metropolitan areas. New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, contain, like&#13;
GSP, very large urban populations. Unlike the U.S. counterparts, GSP has a&#13;
very high percentage of its labor force employment in manufacturing and that&#13;
industrial employment is far less specialized. This is especially noticeable&#13;
in the area of heavy industries.   GSP accounts for approximately 40% of&#13;
national value-added in iron and steel, and fabricated metals; 70% in&#13;
transport equipment; and 35% in chemicals (including significant portions of&#13;
the petrochemicals sector).&#13;
C. Possible Explanations for the Limited Degree of Specialization&#13;
of Greater Sao Paulo&#13;
The concentration of manufacturing in GSP, specifically the lack of&#13;
specialization within manufacturing, suggest some hypotheses. First, it is&#13;
possible that, in large centers, the variety of urban services and the&#13;
1/ The localization elasticities are also somewhat larger than the Brazilian&#13;
values, when evaluated at the same industry size (500 employees).&#13;
However, median U.S. employment in any industry across the sample of urban&#13;
agglomerations is typically near 2,500 employees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
subsidization of such services is greater than elsewhere. This introduces the&#13;
possibility that labor is willing to work for less than the wage levels&#13;
otherwise expected from a neoclassical, "competitive" model. The hypothesis&#13;
is still consistent with wages being higher in GSP than elsewhere; the rate of&#13;
decline would simply not be as steep under these circumstances. Second, it is&#13;
possible that some sectors receive subsidies that are tied to large city&#13;
locations, permitting returns on investment in excess of what would prevail at&#13;
alternative sites. Finally, locational inertia may favor deconcentration over&#13;
decentralization, preserving the momentum of a metropolitan area by spreading&#13;
growth over a somewhat larger area.&#13;
One study, 1/ drawing on 1970 demographic census data for South-&#13;
Southeast urban areas, concludes that the variety of amenities, including&#13;
public services like education, is greater in large centers, like GSP.&#13;
Furthermore, this draws skilled workers in disproportionate numbers to such&#13;
centers, where they accept a discount in wages over what they would otherwise&#13;
be willing to ask. Low skill workers, to a lesser degree, also appear willing&#13;
to work in large centers for less than otherwise expected. Much the same&#13;
conclusion might be drawn from a review of intergovernmental relations&#13;
discussed below. 2/ There is evidence that workers in GSP can accept lower&#13;
than expected wages because the value of public services consumed is higher&#13;
than the taxes and user charges paid, and because the subsidy element is&#13;
greatest in such a center. It is possible that secondary centers have a&#13;
smaller, more costly pool of skilled labor, compared to what would prevail&#13;
under alternative scenarios involving public service provision. Given the&#13;

limited substitutability of low for high skilled labor found in Brazilian&#13;
manufacturing, 1/ this might bar a range of industries from considering&#13;
hinterland locations. Work dealing with Sao Paulo state growth during the&#13;
1970s reviews the issue of skill constraints indirectly. 2/ Secondary centers&#13;
in that state are found to be growing rapidly, and absorbing a wide range of&#13;
industries, many non-traditional. Nevertheless, the labor force composition&#13;
of more remote secondary centers is less skill intensive than GSP's, and this&#13;
may imply some constraints on sectoral diversification.3/&#13;
Even harder to resolve is the question of area-specific subsidization&#13;
of economic activity. In the absence of specific industry studies, which&#13;
would review initial location choices, the evolution of those choices over&#13;
time, and their relation to public sector actions, it is impossible to resolve&#13;
the issues raised. Casual empiricism suggests, however, that for sectors&#13;
whose concentration in Sao Paulo is puzzling, there are institutional&#13;
distortions at work. The foreign-owned motor vehicle industry has faced&#13;
politically-imposed barriers to entry after the initial nucleus located in GSP&#13;
over two decades ago. This has restricted new competitors at new locations.&#13;
The recency of the GSP motor vehicle capital stock, plus occasional problems&#13;
of overcapacity, has probably also delayed the locational diversification of&#13;

3/ In terms of educational attainment, the percent of labor force with 9 or&#13;
more years of education is quite similar across'Sao Paulo, varying from&#13;
16% in GSP at the large agglomeration in the inner ring beyond it, to 11&#13;
percent in the small centers of the Western Hinterland. The difference in&#13;
the proportion of technical and professional workers are larger, varying&#13;
from 16% in GSP and the large city inner ring to 7% in the small city&#13;
Western Hinterland. The latter area, when compared to the GSP large city&#13;
inner ring, has higher proportions of its labor force in semi-skilled work&#13;
and smaller proportions in skilled work.&#13;

existing producers. Location decisions in the petrochemical sector have&#13;
always been subject to great interstate political competition, given the high&#13;
degree of public sector ownership. This suggests a role for non-market&#13;
factors in GSP's national pre-eminence. Finally, a pattern of public sector&#13;
take-overs of GSP iron and steel works experiencing financial distress&#13;
suggests government efforts to perpetuate certain historic location patterns,&#13;
while private investors appear to favor decentralized locations in and around&#13;
Belo Horizonte.&#13;
Also unclear is the role of the formal capital market, controlled by&#13;
national public institutions. Proof of their neglect of centers other than&#13;
those that have been historically pre-eminent would require the types of&#13;
examination that, regretably, could not be included among the already&#13;
diversified portfolio of project tasks. The same must be said about the full&#13;
locational implications of procedures utilized to manage sectoral programs. 1/&#13;
Both of these factors could help to explain the extraordinary overall amount&#13;
of manufacturing activity in GSP.&#13;
Finally, one should not ignore the results of the plant-specific&#13;
survey work discussed next in an attempt to understand why decentralized&#13;
development does not proceed at a faster pace. The risk-averse location&#13;
strategy of entrepreneurs in historically pre-eminent centers allows for a&#13;
heavy dose of locational inertia. Long-distance branching and relocation have&#13;
been discouraged by limited search procedures which slow the identification of&#13;
favorable business environments elsewhere. Thus the possibility of drawing on&#13;
"mobile" expansion to decentralize growth is relatively small. If there are&#13;
imperfections in the rate at which technology flows to secondary centers, if&#13;
1/ A start has been made in this area. See Part VI.&#13;

there are qualitative differences in entrepreneurship based on city.size-and&#13;
experience with manufacturing, and if there are distortions which make&#13;
investment resources relatively more abundant in big cities, then.the&#13;
vaccuum" created by the lack of decentralization from GSP may not be filled&#13;
immediately by local effort in secondary centers. Thus decisions on location;&#13;
by GSP-based firms will affect the growth rates of other centers, and help&#13;
ulaintain the relative pre-eminence of GSP in the short-to-medium term.&#13;
V.  Exploring the Links Between Urban Decentralized&#13;
Development and Plant Location Behavior&#13;
Cities are convenient abstractions within which economic agents of&#13;
various kinds make decisions and collectively determine the fate of urban&#13;
areas. It is therefore important to explore the degree to which decentralized&#13;
industrial development is constrained from proceeding more rapidly over time&#13;
by the choices made by investors regarding plant location. This section.&#13;
presents some hypotheses concerning investor behavior in a world where&#13;
information is costly to gather and evaluate. Some survey and secondary data&#13;
are brought to bear to test the realism of these. hypotheses.&#13;
A. Working Hypotheses on Location Choice Behavior 1/&#13;
The search for information bearing on locational alternatives is&#13;
infrequent in the life of a company. Firms do not look constantly at the set&#13;
1/ The behavioral underpinnings of the industrial location decision have been&#13;
summarized in such studies as P. Townroe, Planning Industrial Location,&#13;
London, Leonard Hill Books, 1976 and R. Schmenner, Making Business&#13;
Location Decisions, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, Prentice Hall, 1982.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
of all possible alternative locations, monitoring the discounted returns from&#13;
investments in each area and ready to move or establish branches at the first&#13;
sign of better opportunities elsewhere. Instead, firms experiencing&#13;
transactions costs associated with moves to new locations, facing blurred&#13;
market signals, and susceptible to inertia, appear to acknowledge the need for&#13;
location-related decisions only when the pressures on existing facilities&#13;
threaten to become a matter of serious concern. Given the above, the search&#13;
for new locations is part of a far more complex investment decision, all the&#13;
more so if in situ expansions eventually are not considered feasible. This,&#13;
in turn, suggest a strategy to limit the uncertainty, risk, complexity, and&#13;
transactions costs of decisions, by comparing in situ expansion with locations&#13;
in only a few, well known areas usually close to the existing plants. When&#13;
moves do take place, then, one would predict that the distances involved will&#13;
be relatively small. Furthermore this model suggests that factors whose costs&#13;
differ significantly over short distances will be given greater consideration&#13;
than those whose costs decline more gradually over space. Even then in situ&#13;
expansions prevail; between 1970 and 1975, two out of three jobs added in Sao&#13;
Paulo state by firms existing prior to 1970 involved stationary expansion&#13;
rather than transfers or branches.&#13;
Once a decision is made to consider a new location, one can assume&#13;
that the choice of branching, rather than transferring, hinges on whether&#13;
there is a simultaneous decision to concentrate on internal reorganization,&#13;
keeping activities together. In that case transfers are likely.&#13;
Alternatively, if the moment of expansion coincides with the desire to&#13;
introduce new product lines, separation of production activities makes sense.&#13;
For births, the presumption made is that decision-makers tend to&#13;
arise out of an existing pool of potential entrepreneurs in a region, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
response to market signals indicating relatively rapid growth in the activity&#13;
in question. Once again, it is unlikely that relative factor costs are&#13;
explicitly considered in such a decision: if the returns on an investment are&#13;
satisfactory, the investment may well be undertaken in spite of potentially&#13;
better opportunities elsewhere.&#13;
B. The Plant Location Survey&#13;
For the purposes of this component, secondary data analysis is&#13;
limited by the type of information gathered by organizations such as the&#13;
Brazilian census bureau. Confidentiality rules also limit the analysis to&#13;
aggregates of plants in an area, averaging together the characteristics of the&#13;
ideal primary unit of observation. In order to expand the scope of&#13;
information and permit analysis of individual plants, a detailed survey of&#13;
plants was undertaken. A generally qualitative survey was administered in&#13;
person. It-probed factors encouraging decisions to move, factors determining&#13;
the attractiveness of alternate locations, procedures used to reach decisions,&#13;
information on choices actually made, and an evaluation of experiences after&#13;
the fact. The same survey form was used to collect quantitative data bearing&#13;
on plant performance, including capital stock, ownership, plant employment,&#13;
company employment, tenure status, prior and present locations, and market&#13;
orientation. A second survey, in the form of a leave-behind, requested very&#13;
detailed quantitative information on, among other things, quantity and value&#13;
of output, output unit prices, destination of sales, quantity and value of&#13;
inputs, input unit prices, origin of inputs, detailed profiles of annual&#13;
costs, rate of return on sales, and profiles of worker characteristics.&#13;
Through ambitious in nature, much of the information was known to be available&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

for tax purposes, and thus easy to assemble. 1/ The surveys were administered&#13;
to a sample of 600 new manufacturing plants in Sao Paulo state. The universe&#13;
consisted of companies in Sao Paulo state that opened new facilities during&#13;
1977, 1978 and 1979, and were registered with the state environmental&#13;
protection agency, the Companhia de Tecnologia de Saneamento Ambiental&#13;
(CETESB). All companies are required to obtain licenses to invest in&#13;
industrial plants and to start production, in the absence of CETESB licenses,&#13;
electricity hook-ups and tax code numbers are denied. 2/ The research team&#13;
drew its 600 plants from a universe of 1961 new openings on file. 3/ The&#13;
sample was stratified, by distance from the city of Sao Paulo and by plant&#13;
size. All new plants located more than 50 kilometers from the center of Sao&#13;
Paulo city and employing 50 or more workers were included. The remainder, all&#13;
employing 10 or more workers, were selected with a bias against smaller plants&#13;
established within metropolitan Sao Paulo. In the final results reported&#13;
below, all responses were weighted to reflect the universe.&#13;
Response rates differed dramatically between the two parts of the&#13;
survey. The directly-administered survey was successfully completed by 581&#13;
out of the 600 firms. The leave-behind, in spite of pressure applied by&#13;
agencies of the state government, yielded only 137 responses, many flawed by a&#13;
high level of non-response to different parts of the questionnaire. While&#13;
1/ The surveys were supplemented by parallel efforts to gather city-level&#13;
data, including infrastructure provision, land prices, travel times, and&#13;
average wages controlling for education.&#13;
2/ In spite of these sanctions, comparisons of Census data for the 197Us and&#13;
CETESB's information suggest that the latter source underestimates births&#13;
to a significant degreee.&#13;
3/ A decision was made not to spend limited resources on interviews with&#13;
firms that made in situ expansions. It was assumed that plant management&#13;
would not be in as good a position to report on alternate locations as&#13;
their mobile counterparts.&#13;

some quantitative information, including plant value-added, was obtained&#13;
elsewhere, much useful information was lost.&#13;
Nevetheless, the attitudinal results proved to be very useful. They&#13;
allowed the project team to explore those determinants of industrial location&#13;
that cannot be quantified (the location decision process, in particular) as&#13;
well as the decision-makers' perceptions of the characteristics of alternate&#13;
locations. Because the industrial location decisions are made in an&#13;
environment of limited information, these perceptions and these approaches to&#13;
decision-making have a bearing on location choice and deserve attention.&#13;
C. Push Factors in the Location Decision: Attitudinal Results&#13;
for Plant Transfers and New Branches 1/&#13;
The survey results confirm the hypothesized association between the&#13;
need to consider new locations and the pressures created by increasing&#13;
production, fully occupied premises, internal reorganization needs, and the&#13;
desire to introduce a new line of products. All but the last is cited by a&#13;
vast majority of new transfers and branches; product considerations were&#13;
listed by 44% of those interviewed. There is no significant difference&#13;
between transfers and branches in the proportion listing "increased&#13;

to pressures to move. Survey results from the developed world can be&#13;

production" or "fully occupied" premises as reasons. Branches are, however,&#13;
far more likely to list new product lines, while transfers are more often&#13;
associated with internal reorganization.&#13;
For suburbanizing plants and plants moving beyond the inner&#13;
metropolis (exurbanizers), 1/ congestion problems, high land costs, high&#13;
building lease costs, and emerging pollution control requirements, all were&#13;
cited as important factors in initiating a search for new facilities by one-&#13;
fifth to one-third of the relevant group. To a lesser extent, firms with&#13;
origins and destinations in cities outside GSP (some of which are quite large)&#13;
also listed the same type of push-inducing costs.&#13;
The results have also been analyzed under other headings and these&#13;
yield additional information. Among the findings are the following: the&#13;
desire to create new facilities with which to introduce new products or in&#13;
which to organize production is more characteristic of large plants than small&#13;
factories; high growth sector firms are more likely to acknowledge the role of&#13;
expansion pressures than slow growth sector firms; concern with labor costs,&#13;
generally unimportant as a factor prompting a decision to move, is cited as&#13;
significant by a minority of firms in labor-intensive sectors like textiles&#13;
and clothing; fear of the consequence of recent pollution control legislation&#13;
is much more apparent among firms in sectors known to be responsible for most&#13;
industrial pollution. Generally, however, the dispersion of responses around&#13;
1/ Moves were classified into four categories: across city, suburbanizing,&#13;
exurbanizing, and all other moves. Across city moves involve moves within&#13;
the center or within 17 inner suburbs and from the inner suburbs to the&#13;
core city. Suburbanizers include plants moving from the core city to the&#13;
17 inner suburbs. Movers from the inner metropolis to the rest of the&#13;
state are listed as exurbanizers. All other moves belong to a residual&#13;
category where the point of origin is outside the inner metropolitan area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
the mean is not very high; factors that are rated very important on average&#13;
are usually rated highly regardless of firm characteristics.&#13;
From a policy-making perspective, the above suggests that an&#13;
important element in generating movement of firms is an appropriate set of&#13;
macroeconomic policies that ensure a high growth environment. In the absence&#13;
of rapid growth-, spatial policies are likely to be difficult to implement at a&#13;
social cost that bears some reasonable relationship to the social benefits.&#13;
D. Patterns of Location Uncovered by Survey 1/&#13;
Consistent with the complexity of decisions involved, a high&#13;
proportion of all moves are very local in character. Generally speaking,&#13;
transfers and branches locate in the vicinity of the previous plant or&#13;
headquarters facility; in fact, 82% of the branches and 51% of the transfers&#13;
never left the municipality of origin. only 13% of the branches and 23% of&#13;
all transfers were made to points farther than 30 kilometers from the borders&#13;
of the origin municipality.&#13;
The survey did, nevertheless, identify one noticeable trend: for&#13;
central city movers, destination to the inner and outer metropolitan counties&#13;
were frequent, involving 58% of plant origins and 71% of the jobs.&#13;
If one-focuses specifically on the exurbanizers, one finds that they&#13;
originate virtually always in the central city, are large, on average, 2/ and&#13;

Supply and Urban Development, Discussion Paper Report No. 49, May 1984.&#13;
2/ In average size (168), percentage with more than 40 employees (28.5%), and&#13;
percentage with fewer than 41 employees (34.5%), these establishments&#13;
"outperform" the other categories of branches and transfers, as well as&#13;
births. All employment data are based on planned totals.&#13;

account for only one-fifth of all recent branch and transfer activity in the&#13;
state. Three out of every four exurbanizing jobs are transfers, indicating&#13;
the small role available for branches in this case as in the case of all&#13;
moves. 1/ Roughly 80% of the exurbanizing branch jobs moved less than 100&#13;
kilometers from Sao Paulo city's center while approximately 90% of the&#13;
transfers moved within ouch a radius. As distances increase from Sao Paulo&#13;
city, plants appear less and less reliant on center city origins. In fact,&#13;
once the area beyond 150 kilometers from the city of Sao Paulo is considered,&#13;
almost all new activity is locally generated 2/, confirming the findings of&#13;
the earlier components of change analysis.&#13;
The above evidence suggests, indirectly, that the evaluation of&#13;
alternatives tends to be restricted to communities fairly close to the point&#13;
of origin. This is confirmed by answers given to questions concerning the&#13;
selection of a new location.&#13;
E. Evidence on the Role of Information in Location Choice 3/&#13;
Among companies starting operations, transferring plants, or opening&#13;
branches, few consider locations in other states or other regions of the same&#13;
state. Most consider only the municipality chosen or those adjoining it;&#13;
specifically, among the surveyed firms, only 8% ever considered locating&#13;
outside Sao Paulo state and only 16% considered another region of the state&#13;
1/ Twenty-two percent of all moves, weighted by employment, involved&#13;
branches.&#13;
2/ Earlier caveats concerning the origin of equity capital apply once again.&#13;

Decisions...," op.cit.&#13;

itself. One subset of firms was more flexible:. 45% of the branches and&#13;
transfers involved in moves from the central city and inner suburbs to areas-&#13;
beyond, did consider a region other than the one selected. This suggests that&#13;
once a relatively long distance move is considered, the firm is willing to be&#13;
more flexible than the average company. Not surprisingly, larger enterprises&#13;
were more likely to consider alternative regions within the state than smaller&#13;
ones.&#13;
ine information gathered in the process .of making location decisions-&#13;
appears to be quite limited. Decision-makers apparently try to satisfy the&#13;
prerequistes for production facilities with a feasible location rather than&#13;
worry about relative costs and benefits across many alternate sites.&#13;
Information-gathering devices, other than site visits, were rarely.utilized by&#13;
the surveyed firms. Few firms engaged in cost comparisons among&#13;
alternatives. As if to emphasize this fact, half the surveyed firms reported&#13;
that, within the region chosen, only the immediate neighborhood finally&#13;
selected was considered.&#13;
F. Attitudinal Evidence on Factors Considered Significant in&#13;
Differentiating Locations I/&#13;
Several variables rated highly across tenure types and distances&#13;
moved; usually 40% or more of the respondents regardless of tenure or type of&#13;
move agreed on their importance. These answers suggest that the dominant&#13;
forces promoting decentralization are concerns about land costs, reliable&#13;

utilities, and access to customers and suppliers by road. Conversely, the&#13;
forces holding firms to the metropolitan area include the perceived need for&#13;
an assured supply of labor with adequate skills, the possibility of leasing&#13;
property, and easy access to a wide variety of business services.&#13;
Among urban services, availability of electric power and tele-&#13;
communications links was stressed by those surveyed. While a concern with&#13;
electricity proved unfounded after the fact, the worry about telecommuni-&#13;
cations was confirmed, even given the conservative moving behavior. Fully 40X&#13;
of the exurbanizers and one-third of the suburbanizers and intra-hinterland&#13;
movers complained about poor telecommunications.&#13;
Also important was the insistence on easy road access for the truck&#13;
movement of inputs and outputs, accompanied by concern that principal&#13;
suppliers and, to a lesser extent, customers be nearby. 1/ Finally, firms&#13;
placed considerable emphasis on having a plentiful supply of labor at their&#13;
disposal and, to a lesser degree, on having labor with the mix of skills&#13;
required by the firms. Concerns about wage rates did not emerge as a very&#13;
significant item, in spite of evidence that nominal wages vary considerably in&#13;
the state. This result, coupled with the fact that few firms reported actual&#13;
difficulties in recruiting labor (even skilled workers), should be read with&#13;
the distances moved and number of alternatives considered in mind.&#13;
Other variables emerged as significant, but only for particular&#13;
groups. Industrial estates were cited as important by one-third of the intra-&#13;
hinterland movers, but rarely by any other group. This response suggests that&#13;
industrial estates are viewed in certain areas as providing a mechanism for&#13;
rapid and coordinated installation of public services, with local governments&#13;
1/ The role of road access was paramount for exurbanizers, who cited the&#13;
factor as important in 86% of the interviews.&#13;

acting as "godfathers" with the parastatal suppliers. births, unusually&#13;
constrained by investment and cash flow problems, tended to stress the need&#13;
for low cost labor and property to lease as important factors. Transfers and&#13;
branches within the inner metropolis cited factors associated with agglomer-&#13;
ation effects, including maintenance and technical services, as well as the&#13;
importance of available property to lease. Finally, suburbanizing transfers&#13;
and branches placed great weight on low-cost land, a factor which was also&#13;
emphasized by the exurbanizers.&#13;
Disaggregating the results by firm characteristics provided a few&#13;
additional insights. Among births, for example, larger plants were&#13;
significantly more concerned with the availabili-ty of oublic services and easy&#13;
road access than smaller ones. In addition, larger new plants tended to put&#13;
considerably more stress on factor associated with dense urban networks,&#13;
including business services and close proximity to suppliers. Smaller plants&#13;
in the "birth" category were far more-likely than their counterparts to stress&#13;
the need for property to lease.&#13;
More generally, smaller plants, regardless of move pattern, tended to.&#13;
be preoccupied with economizing on start-up investments, and stressed ease of&#13;
leasing. Larger plants tended to stress land costs more heavily than their&#13;
counterparts. In other respects, however, it became apparent that "births"&#13;
were rather exceptional: in few transfer or branch cases did plant size have a&#13;
bearing on the way proximity to business services, access to suppliers, or&#13;
availability of utilities was rated. In fact, one could argue that&#13;
disaggregating the results by firm characteristics did not modify more&#13;
aggregate conclusions in any unexpected manner.&#13;

G. The Role of Infrastructure Adequacy in Shaping Location Decisions:&#13;
Survey Data and Existing Conditions 1/&#13;
The role of infrastructure was one of the issues explored more deeply&#13;
in attempting to differentiate locations, always searching for reasons why&#13;
long-distance branching and transfers are unusual. Could non-metropolitan&#13;
centers simply be ill-equipped to meet business standards of acceptable&#13;
infrastructure provisions?&#13;
This issue was explored using quantitative techniques, though,&#13;
unfortunately, the project's resource constraints prevented the gathering of&#13;
primary data on indices of industry-specific infrastructure coverage.&#13;
Household-level coverage data were used as a proxy and this exercise was only&#13;
performed in Sao Paulo state.&#13;
Analysis of secondary data for urban area of the state suggests that,&#13;
over the last twenty years, infrastructure provision has improved dramatically&#13;
all across Sao Paulo. By 1978, for example, over 80% of all urban households&#13;
outside metropolitan Sao Paulo had electricity connections, over 75 percent&#13;
had piped water supplies, and over 55 percent were linked to a sewage&#13;
network. Given rapid growth in GSP, urban households in the hinterland cities&#13;
were, on average, better provided than households in the metropolitan area.&#13;
Other indices of infrastructure, including paved road access and telephone&#13;
service, have also grown dramatically and brought hinterland standards to&#13;
1/ Background information provided in D. Keen, "The Role of Public Infra-&#13;
structure Investment in Stimulating Growth and Development," Washington,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
levels not dissimilar from those found in GSP. 1/    In the latter case, in&#13;
fact, one can claim the state is well serviced by high quality road network by&#13;
any reasonable standard.&#13;
Nevertheless, industrial decision-makers' perceptions of adequacy&#13;
need not necessarily correspond to that suggested by these data. The large-&#13;
scale sample survey of managers of new plants established in 1977-1979&#13;
suggests that, this gap, where it exists, may be caused by our inadequate&#13;
measure of differences over space in service quality, reliability, and average&#13;
time for infrastructure hook-up. Alternately, however, it may confirm a&#13;
hypothesis that infrastructure quality differences are dealt with&#13;
superficially in location decisions in Sao Paulo, given the limited search&#13;
procedures used in making those decisions. This limited search has, as noted,&#13;
the side-effect of confining the comparison of alternatives to geographically&#13;
contigious areas with similar characteristics. Finally, it is possible that&#13;
perceptions of decision-makers change only-slowly, in lagged response to&#13;
actual changes in infrastructure availability.&#13;
Surveyed firms rarely complained about infrastructure problems.&#13;
Almost no locator in the metropolitan area, for example, explicitly rejected&#13;
hinterland locations primarily because of infrastructure deficiencies. Within&#13;
the state regions chosen, few firms locating within the city of Sao Paulo&#13;
complained about infrastructure; elsewhere, similar minorities in the fast-&#13;
growing metropolitan suburbs and in the hinterland cities complained about&#13;
problems with water and telecommunications.&#13;
1/ For example, in 1978, the percent of urban households with telephones&#13;
varied across the state as follows: City of Sao Paulo (31%), inner&#13;
suburbs (18%), outer suburbs (8%), large Inner Ring cities (24%), small&#13;
Inner Ring cities (16%), Western Hinterland cities (21%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
For plants which had headquarters in or had transferred out of the&#13;
city of Sao Paulo or adjacent suburbs, complaints about perceived&#13;
deterioration in service quality over that at the original location centered&#13;
on "soft" infrastructure, including sanitation, education, medical, and&#13;
recreation facilities. This was particularly apparent in the metropolitan&#13;
suburbs and in the hinterland. In addition, suburban Sao Paulo traffic&#13;
conditions and the cost of housing in those areas were singled out for&#13;
unfavorable mention. These, however, were not dimensions measured by the&#13;
project infrastructure documentation effort.&#13;
With all these factors in mind, it is not surprising that only in one&#13;
respect -- the ability to predict that a transfer or branch plant will have&#13;
problems with local infrastructure, using household coverage data -- did the&#13;
quantitative work yield results that are significant for a range of public&#13;
utilities. Relative infrastructure coverage proved to be inadequate in&#13;
predicting whether the quality of a particular utility service had improved or&#13;
deteriorated after a move between cities. Consequently these household&#13;
coverage indices performed poorly as predictors of the location of new&#13;
activity between cities. Only in the case of sewer networks did the&#13;
statistical work undertaken find a statistically significant relationship&#13;
between relative coverage at the distribution of births, transfers, and&#13;
branches across cities.&#13;

H. The Role of Information Flow Imperfections in Shaping&#13;
Location Decisions 1/&#13;
One study analyzed firms that chose to locate plants at alternate&#13;
urban centers outside GSP, uing a discrete choice model where the probability&#13;
of a plant locating_ini any_given urban area is related to Profitabilitrat&#13;
that location divided by profitability at all nompetin- locations.   An&#13;
important finding of this quantitative work was the confirmation that search&#13;
costs do constrain decision-makers in ways-already suggested by the survey&#13;
results. A measure of the distance between the plant's origin (for transfers)&#13;
or headquarters location (for branches) and the various alternatives&#13;
considered proved to have a large, negative, and highly significant&#13;
coefficient. At the same time the impact of price variables seemed to be in&#13;
proportion to the distance it takes for price difference to become&#13;
noticeable: nominal wages, whose variation for any worker type is noticed&#13;
only over relatively great distances, play no significant role in the model;&#13;
land prices, whose variation is apparent over relatively short distances, have&#13;
a significant impact. Thus the search procedures, which limit choice largely&#13;
to adjacent communities, have an impact on the variables that play a key role&#13;
in new location choices. This tends to verify the results of the survey,&#13;
especially the conclusion that nominal wage variations are of secondary&#13;
concern. 2/&#13;
1/ This section is based on E. Hansen, "Why Do Different Firms Locate Where&#13;
They Do: An Empirical Analysis of the Productivity, Wages, and Location&#13;
of New Manufacturing Plants in Sao Paulo, Brazil," Washington, D.C., Water&#13;
Supply and Urban Development Department Discussion Paper, Report No. 25,&#13;
The World Bank, August 1983.&#13;
2/ As a by-product of this work, own industry size, a proxy for localization&#13;
economies, proved again to be an important element in the location&#13;
decision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
One additional finding proved important in highlighting the role of&#13;
information imperfections in the location decision. Techniques exist for&#13;
testing whether decision-makers act as if GSP locations and non-GSP locations&#13;
are so dissimilar, one from the other, that the firm follows a two-step&#13;
process: *first, choosing between GSP and non-GSP, and then locations within&#13;
the chosen set. 1/ The evidence suggests that this is, in fact, the case,&#13;
further blunting the ability of particular secondary centers to compete for&#13;
jobs being generated within the state.&#13;
All this reinforces earlier suggestions that the economic growth of&#13;
any area is likely to draw upon local resources rather than diverting activity&#13;
from GSP itself. Dependence on long-distance branching and transfers, based&#13;
on market signals highlighting input price variations over space, is simply&#13;
not a viable option for most communities to base their economic development.&#13;
I. Additional Thoughts on the Role of Wage Signals&#13;
in Location Behavior&#13;
Analysts familiar with the location literature in developed countries&#13;
are puzzled by the low weight generally given to nominal wage variations in&#13;
determining locations in the Sao Paulo case. 2/ The presence of large&#13;
variation in nominal wages over space for all types of labor documented below,&#13;
excludes one explanation for that low weight.&#13;
1/ This is done by estimating the correlation between the unobserved elements&#13;
of utility associated with location choices (i.e., the 'error" terms)&#13;
among non-GSP alternatives. The high degree of correlation in the error&#13;
terms indicates the locations are grouped together in the minds of the&#13;
decision-makers.&#13;
2/ See, for example, the findings reported in P. Townroe, Industrial&#13;
Movement... , op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
Neoclassical theory argues that, under conditions of perfectly&#13;
competitive-factor and product markets, and no barriers to spatial mobility,-&#13;
the nominal wage at a given location is the market clearing price, set by-the7&#13;
demand for labor by firms, and the supply of labor by workers. 1/ In the&#13;
long-run, the market clearings price for a given type of worker will vary&#13;
across locations. On the demand side, firms will be willing to-pay higher&#13;
nominal wages in locations where there are off-setting locational cost&#13;
advantages. On the supply side, worker located in areas with locational costs&#13;
advantages (especially agglomeration effects) are likely to face high living&#13;
costs and disarmenity levels, and thus will demand high nominal wages. Thus&#13;
firms seek to minimize efficiency wages, i.e., nominal wages adjusted for&#13;
variations in worker productivity attributable to all sources. Workers will&#13;
seek to maximize real wages.&#13;
The pursuit of these criteria is consistent with considerable spatial&#13;
variation-in nominal wages. Larger city size-generally produces higher.&#13;
nominal wages. Certain demand side distortions can affect wages to workers:&#13;
government favoritism toward a given sector, firm size, or locations can&#13;
increase the ability of beneficiary firms to pay high nominal wages. Firms&#13;
with considerable market power may exercise some control over market prices -,&#13;
and thus wages. Finally, transactions costs and lack of information can&#13;

across a region as large as Sao Paulo state. One good source is R.&#13;
Goldfarb and A. Yezer, "Evaluating Alternative Theories of Intercity and&#13;
Interregional Wage Differentials", Journal of Regional Science, 1976 (4),&#13;
pp. 345-363. The more recent literature has concentrated on estimating&#13;
the role of amenities and disamenities in attracting or repelling labor&#13;
for particular markets (see, for example, S. Rosen, "Wage-Based Indices of&#13;
Urban Quality of Life", in P. Mieszkowski and M. Straszheim, eds., Current&#13;
Issues in Urban Economics, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press,&#13;
1979, pp. 74-104. Work on the determinants of wages across space in&#13;

affect nominal wages, if firms fail to exploit lower efficiency wages by&#13;
location shifts. In each case listed above -- city size, demand side&#13;
distortions, market power, and search procedures - there may distinct spatial&#13;
effects. To these are joined supply side effects; ignorance of spatial&#13;
variations in real wages, as well as wage legislation and other policy-induced&#13;
distortions, can affect nominal wages in space. In addition, as noted&#13;
earlier, it is possible that wage demands will be affected by perceived&#13;
'bargains" in the variety and/or cost of urban services in different size&#13;
cities.&#13;
With the available data, it is possible to document the extent of&#13;
spatial variation in nominal wages, controlling for a variety of factors. The&#13;
data used are drawn from the 1980 Brazilian social security files, and cover&#13;
manufacturing workers in Sao Paulo state. 1/ Cross-tabular analysis suggests&#13;
that wages appear to fall both with declining city size and increasing&#13;
distance from GSP. Because of the interactions of city size and distance in&#13;
Sao Paulo state, the joint effect is best appreciated by looking at average&#13;
wages in metropolitan Sao Paulo, on the east coast; the large cities 2/ of the&#13;
inner ring, extending to about 150 kilometers from Sao Paulo city; the small&#13;
cities of the inner ring; the western hinterland large cities; and the rest of&#13;
the urban western hinterland. Setting average wages in GSP equal to an index&#13;
number of 100, the indices decline across the categories as follows: 78, 63,&#13;
54, 40.&#13;
1/ The work is based on a one percent sample of employee records in the city&#13;
of Sao Paulo, and a ten percent sample of employee records in the rest of&#13;
the state. After adjustments for sample data distortions, approximately&#13;
181,000 records were processed. See, A. Hamer and&#13;
W. Dillinger, "Labor Market Behavior in Sao Paulo", Washington, D.C.,&#13;
Water Supply and Urban Development Department Discussion Paper, Report No.&#13;
27, The World Bank, June 1983.&#13;
2/ Large cities had over 50,000 inhabitants in 1970; small cities fell below&#13;
that level in that year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
These are sizeable differences, especially since they persist when&#13;
wages paid are controlled for labor quality. Higher skills, greater&#13;
experience (age), more education, and longer tenure, are all associated with&#13;
higher wages, regardless of location. Males are also paid more than women. 1/&#13;
Furthermore, within any given class of worker, wages decline with distance&#13;
from metro Sao Paulo and by city size groupings within any ring. Manual and&#13;
skilled workers in GSP are paid roughly twice what they would receive in the&#13;
small town western hinterland. Similarly, technical workers and workers with&#13;
even higher qualifications receive more than twice the prevailing western&#13;
hinterland small town wage by working in GSP. Even illiterate workers are&#13;
paid twice as much in the metro area as in the small town West. Sizeable&#13;
1, &#13;
spatial variations continue to occur when wages are controlled for such&#13;
variables as age, tenure on job, sex, plant size, and industry sector. The&#13;
large spatial variation in nominal wages, therefore, is not merely a labor&#13;
force quality composition effect. Lower wages in hinterland locations reflect&#13;
lower wages paid to labor of all types in such locations.&#13;
Various regressions were run to verify that the cross-tabular&#13;
regularities would hold up after other factors were controlled. The results&#13;
confirmed the earlier findings. Wages vary systematically in relation to the&#13;
variables examined, even when the impact of all other variables is taken into&#13;
account. Skill level, age, experience, and sex are statistically significant&#13;
as explanatory variables, and have the expected signs; together with "distance&#13;
from Sao Paulo (city)" they help explain a sizeable proportion of wage&#13;
1/ Plant characteristics also affect wages. Though the impact of plant&#13;
employment size is erratic, industrial sector has a sizeable effect. Over&#13;
space, as before, wages decline.&#13;

variation over space. These conclusions hold both in the aggregate and in&#13;
cases where individual industrial subsectors are considered separately.&#13;
Particularly interesting is the finding that, in the aggregate and&#13;
for specific subsectors, wages decline by approximately 20 percent as distance&#13;
from metropolitan Sao Paulo is doubled, even when other worker characteristics&#13;
are controlled. Further work is needed to determine what this implies for_the&#13;
behavior of efficiency wages over space, i.e., wages corrected for variations&#13;
in value-added per worker. It is important to know which subsectors&#13;
experience decreases in productivity with distance that are slower than the&#13;
rate of decline in nominal wages. Should this include subsectors that are&#13;
severely underrepresented in the hinterland, then a link would be shown to&#13;
exiat between production patterns and growth rates across the hierarchy of&#13;
cities, and the distortions or imperfections cited earlier. In particular,&#13;
one would have to fall back to the limited search hypothesis, according to&#13;
which industrial locators focus largely on adjacent area conditions, to&#13;
explain why wage variations appear to play a limited role in location&#13;
behavior. Alternatively, if subsector efficiency wages vary little with&#13;
distance, or actually increase as one moves toward hinterland locations, then&#13;
productivity "bargains" would prove to be an illusion. This would leave only&#13;
the size of local labor markets, and their potential wage respose to new&#13;
demand created by a new enterprise, as the appropriate locational variable.l/&#13;
1/ Data limitations also restricted work on a final set of hypotheses. It&#13;
was not possible to test for the impact of differential subsidization of&#13;
public services by distance from Sao Paulo city; nor was the role of&#13;
spatial differences in the variety of publicly provided goods and services&#13;
examined. Either factor could, if important, depress nominal wages in the&#13;
developed coastal region, as workers in those areas accept better/cheaper&#13;
services in lieu of higher pay. This would have repercussions throughout&#13;
the region's city system: given the level of worker productivity in each&#13;
subregion, any downward-sloping efficiency wage gradient that might exist&#13;
under more neutral conditions would be flattened out, to the advantage of&#13;
Greater Sao Paulo.&#13;

J. Industrial Location Behavior and Local Public Policy&#13;
Changes in locational patterns are easier to effect in an economic&#13;
environment characterized by high growth induced by appropriate macroeconomic&#13;
policies. This puts pressure on existing plants to reconsider their location,&#13;
it puts pressure on the environment of the historically pre-eminent centers&#13;
(cost of land, congestion, etc.), and it generates births. That having been&#13;
said, it should be clear that the location decision is molded_by-r-isk-averse&#13;
behavior, implying the possible neglect of unexploited opportunities outside&#13;
centers like metropolitan Sao Paulo. While some market signals are working to&#13;
expel activity from large centers, most_of the movement is short-distance.&#13;
Firms use this strategy because location choice is part of a complex&#13;
investment decision and because they are not organized to perform location&#13;
searches. Furthermore, information-gathering and the evaluation of assembled&#13;
data is a costly process. It is clear that an instrument like the branch&#13;
plant does not yet provide a major low-cost way out of these difficulties, and&#13;
it is therefore not a significant contributor to decentralized economic-&#13;
development. Births, on the other hand, arise rapidly across a large number&#13;
of areas and, as such, provide peripheral areas with a beneficial side-effect&#13;
of limited search procedures: investors are encouraged to invest locally&#13;
partly because they do not explore options elsewhere, including metropolitan&#13;
ones. It then becomes important to take such initiatives as might improve the&#13;
chances of survival and growth for such economic activity in the secondary and&#13;
other centers.&#13;
What can local public officials do? They can start by adjusting&#13;
their expectations. As the framework presented earlier and the survey itself&#13;
indicate, many of the aspects that make a community attractive relative to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
another to different types of firms arise spontaneously. Thus, business&#13;
services are either adequately developed or they are not; localization&#13;
economies can be exploited to a significant degree or they cannot. Other&#13;
local features are not directly modifiable in any cost-effective way because&#13;
they result from innumerable individual decisions taken across a whole&#13;
region: the labor market is a good example of this. Local government can,&#13;
however, work indirectly to attract skilled labor through systematic efforts&#13;
to improve public services, especially the quality of area schools.&#13;
It is unlikely that much can be done for industrial firms except to&#13;
improve general business conditions at the margin. In this area there are&#13;
some specific suggestions arising from the survey. It is not obvious that&#13;
municipal location incentives, such as giving away land, does more than&#13;
provide untargeted and costly advertising. In fact, since the chances of&#13;
attracting long-distance moves drops off dramatically as distances from the&#13;
metropolitan area exceed 100 kilometers or so, it is folly for distant&#13;
communities to entertain grand illusions about correcting the perceptions of&#13;
strangers. Even the closer-in communities, which do benefit from limited&#13;
activity transfer, should keep information dissemination efforts at a modest&#13;
level. Local officials might disseminate information concerning recent&#13;
trends, bottlenecks, short-term ways around such bottlenecks, and steps taken&#13;
to remedy them. Such measures can probably do no harm and may justify the&#13;
resources devoted to them. More than that is not cost-effective; there is&#13;
nothing to commend detailed, pre-feasibility studies for narrowly-defined&#13;
activities or, alternatively, work on large-scale, year 2000, "color-coded"&#13;
map planning.&#13;
Local authorities can, however, exploit the possibilities of a&#13;
"godfather" role in the extension of infrastructure provided by various public&#13;
sector agencies at the state and national level, especially paved roads and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
good telecommunications facilities. Coordinated availability of reliable&#13;
infrastructure within a reasonable time span should help reduce the burden&#13;
faced by new and expanding activities, especially in less-favored, peripheral&#13;
regions. Beyond that, and instead of creating expensive, large-scale&#13;
industrial parks, some efforts might be devoted to encouraging small business&#13;
through the introduction of programs that provide low cost buildings for lease&#13;
purposes.&#13;
Finally the local officials are left with the conceptually simple but&#13;
politically difficult job of creating pressures to encourage the removal of&#13;
constraints that stand in the way of improved access to investment resources&#13;
-- public and private -- on reasonably equal terms. This "bottom-up"&#13;
initiative is important not only because such constraints might foreclose some&#13;
decentralization of activity from the metropolis to the periphery, but because&#13;
they work to stifle local initiative.&#13;
VI. Exploring the Role of Policy-Induced Distortions&#13;
on Industrial Location Behavior&#13;
A. Difficulties Faced in Measuring Implicit Policy Effects&#13;
Public settor policies need not be explicitly spatial to have major&#13;
impacts on the location of industry.   Sector-specific industrial promotion&#13;
policies, fiscal policies, and other "non-spatial" policies favor the&#13;
industrial development of some locations over others. Where these "implicit"&#13;
spatial policies go unrecognized, their impacts can thwart any explicit&#13;
spatial policies aimed at industrial decentralization.&#13;
Implicit spatial policies are difficult to measure, however. The&#13;
data problems involved are substantial. Beyond that, the eventual impact of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
implicit spatial policies depends on the way in which factors of production&#13;
adjust to them./ The project's preliminary theoretical work suggests various&#13;
outcomes of a sector-specific promotion policy, depending upon the inter-&#13;
sectoral and spatial mobility of capital and labor. 1/ Thus, it is clear that&#13;
the factor requirements for different production processes will vary widely,&#13;
as will the supplies of the factors at different locations. In the extreme,&#13;
some factors (including localization economies) required for the production of&#13;
particular commodities at competitive prices may be available only at certain&#13;
specific locations. Individual sectors will also differ in the emphasis they&#13;
place on such variables as access to international trade routes, proximity to&#13;
markets, or to own-industry concentrations.&#13;
Now, one can consider a situation where there are location-specific&#13;
factors and factors which move within the same area quickly but only slowly&#13;
move between areas. Under these circumstances, promotion policies favoring&#13;
sectors which are, in effect, location-bound will result in long-term&#13;
subsidies for particular urban areas. If the promotion policies are ill-&#13;
advised on macroeconomic grounds, the differential urban impact is one more&#13;
reason to consider reforms. If the promotion policies are justified but the&#13;
economic environment is such that economic agents (in urban areas other than&#13;
those benefitted) are denied access to resources on reasonably equal terms&#13;
with which to remedy some locational deficiencies, then the public sector&#13;
should act quickly to remedy the matter. Only where sector promotion policies&#13;

Industrial Activities: A Factor-Market Adjustment Approach", Washington,&#13;
D.C., Urban Development Department Discussion Paper, Report No. 12, The&#13;
World Bank, September 1982. The systematic analysis of the links between&#13;
sectoral policies and spatial impacts is a relatively new field; thus, the&#13;
paper has few antecedents of comparable scope.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
are justified, and where there is no efficient way to diminish the number of&#13;
severely location-bound factors, can the government remain passive to the&#13;
spatial consequences of particular promotion policies. 1/    For ignoring&#13;
implicit spatial policy impacts amounts to neglecting the important fact that&#13;
the selective reinforcement of particular urban centers increases the&#13;
attractiveness of such places relative to the rest of the urban system.&#13;
B. Regional Incidence of Non-Spatial Incentive Systems in Brazil&#13;
The above framework suggests the need to explore interactions between&#13;
economic promotion incentives and location-behavior over a long period of&#13;
time. The data needs of such an exercise are massive, however. In its stead,&#13;
an attempt was made simply to document the regional impact of the combined&#13;
effects of tariffs,-fiscal exemptions, and interest rate subsidies by sector,&#13;
as they existed in 1980-81. 2/&#13;
For all internally-traded, domestically-produced manufactured goods,&#13;
incentives, on average, added 23%-to the value-added obtained by producers.&#13;
If this Brazil-wide average subsidy is set equal to an index number of 100,&#13;
the level in GSP is 128, with comparable levels (132) experienced by&#13;
metropolis-dominated Rio de Janeiro state. At the state level, Sao Paulo,&#13;
1/ This analysis has value even when extended to "footloose" sectors, which&#13;
have many locations from which to choose. If factors flow sluggishly&#13;
between urban areas, historic concentrations of a promoted "footloose"&#13;
sector will receive a windfall subsidy which may be erased only slowly.&#13;
Worse still, if promotion policies are administered in such a way that&#13;
certain locations allow easier access to favors, then one has a barrier&#13;
that transforms the sector into a location-bound one.&#13;
2/ This large-scale exercise is reported in-W. Tyler, "The Brazilian Sectoral&#13;
Incentive System and the Regional Incidence of Non-Spatial Incentive&#13;
Policies", Washington, D.C., Urban Development Department Discussion&#13;
Paper, Report No. 31, The World Bank, September 1983.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
Rio, and Minas experience relatively high levels of subsidization, given their&#13;
product mix; Minas is relatively recent beneficiary of government efforts to&#13;
boost national output of natural resource-based intermediate goods. By&#13;
contrast, the impoverished Northeast region and the South region each received&#13;
average benefit levels well below the national mean; the applicable index&#13;
numbers are 70 for the Northeast and 51 for the South. In both cases the mix&#13;
of manufacturing output is not favored by the types of industrial promotion&#13;
incentives used by the government.&#13;
Further analysis is required to examine these impacts, extending the&#13;
data into the past, and deciding how much of the location pattern was caused&#13;
by inappropriate sectoral policies, inappropriate administration, and public&#13;
sector refusal to deal with location barriers that would have been lowered&#13;
efficiently had the government been concerned enough to do so.&#13;
One can, however, advance the following hypothesis: the cumulative&#13;
effect of pouring subsidies into a city region like GSP has been to dull&#13;
market signals suggesting alternate locations for economic activity. In the&#13;
absence of restrictions on urban expansion, this subsidization raised the&#13;
returns to factors, at least in the short-run, after which capital and labor&#13;
inmigrations may have lowered such returns. The migration effect, though&#13;
depressing returns, was offset to an unknown degree, by own-industry scale&#13;
effects and by the spatial focusing of technological change embodied in&#13;
foreign investment, often with the government's blessing. These "offsets"&#13;
have boosted productivity, and allowed factors to continue to reap rewards&#13;
initiated by the subsidies. While it is true that large centers experienced&#13;
rising land costs and the burdens of unpriced externalities, it was possible&#13;
for firms and workers to suburbanize or exurbanize to nearby areas, reaping&#13;
the benefits while avoiding part of the penalties of large urban size.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. Incidence of Fiscal Policies in Brazil: A Sao Paulo Case Study&#13;
There is fragmentary evidence to suggest that the public sector in&#13;
Brazil has framed fiscal policies so that historically pre-eminent centers,&#13;
already blessed by promotion subsidies, receive a disproportionate share of&#13;
resources for managing urban growth. These conclusions were derived from a&#13;
study that examined the pattern of availability and pricing of selected public&#13;
utilities, the pattern of locally-raised revenues and state/federal transfers,&#13;
and the nature of local government autonomy. 1/&#13;
In Brazil, water and sewer investments are funded by the state and&#13;
federal governments; and resources are drawn from user charges, state grants,&#13;
federal grants, and subsidized federal loans. The spatial distribution of&#13;
investments over the recent past in Sao Paulo unquestionably favor GSP.&#13;
During the period 1968-1974, 800 million dollars (1978) was disbursed for&#13;
water and sewer system construction. Of this 92% went to municipalities&#13;
within GSP, and a total of 80% went to the central city alone. The share of&#13;
the metropolitan area, and of the capital, is disproportionate either to&#13;
population or the relative number of unserved households, using 1970 census&#13;
data as a guide. Investments per urban household were four times as high in&#13;
GSP as elsewhere; the city, alone, the level was six times as high.&#13;
Investment pet unserved household in the metro area exceeded those elsewhere&#13;
in the Sao Paulo urban system by a factor of 2.3 (sewer) and 2.7 (water).&#13;
1/ The study results are reported in W. Dillinger, "Implicit Spatial&#13;
Policies: The Case of Fiscal Systems in Sao Paulo State", Washington,&#13;
D.C., Urban and Regional Economics Division Report No. 81-27, Development&#13;
Economics Department, The World Bank, November 1981. The conceptual&#13;
framework is drawn from various works by V. Henderson, the most recent of&#13;
which is "The Impact of Government Policies on Urban Concentration,&#13;
Journal of Urban Economics, 1982(3), pp. 280-303.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
Data for more recent years are scarce, but information for 1979 suggests a&#13;
continuation of earlier patterns. 1/&#13;
To the above must be added another conclusion: local autonomy in the&#13;
conventional fiscal system is very limited in Brazil, but the network in place&#13;
does provide historically pre-eminent centers with a disproportionate share of&#13;
revenues. Dominant administrative responsibility at the local level is&#13;
restricted to land use control, local street paving, and the provision of&#13;
certain urban amenities. In various other functions, including education,&#13;
water and sewer network construction, highways, health posts, and public&#13;
safety, local governments provide for a portion of the costs, sharing&#13;
decision-making with higher levels of government. Given this, it is not&#13;
surprising that local levels control only 15% of all revenues collected in or&#13;
allocated to Sao Paulo state. The bulk of these resources comes from higher-&#13;
level transfers, and among these the proceeds of the value-added tax is&#13;
crucial. It is paid according to the origin of the value-added, though the&#13;
incidence of the tax is assumed to spread well beyond municipal boundaries to&#13;
customers across Brazil; this is especially true for GSP products. Thus, the&#13;
value-added tax clearly favors pre-eminent centers of economic activity and&#13;
provides such areas with per capita resources well beyond that of most smaller&#13;
centers.&#13;
Unfortunately, a complete accounting of all public sector spending&#13;
and charges by locality is not yet available. This is unlikely to modify the&#13;
general conclusions reached: in Sao Paulo, there are spatial disparities&#13;
between the value of the urban services consumed by firms and workers, and the&#13;
taxes and charges actually paid by these users. The ultimate impact may well&#13;

electricity, are not available.&#13;

- 65&#13;
be capitalized into lower -than expected factor costs in favored locations like&#13;
GSP, as workers are attracted to such areas because of the cited value of~&#13;
urban services differential. In such cases, the market signals encouraging&#13;
deconcentration or decentralization in GSP are likely to be muted by the&#13;
fiscal system in place.&#13;
In turn, this suggests a need to restructure intergovernmental fiscal&#13;
relations. Metropolitan areas should be forced to pass on to consumers the&#13;
full costs of all public services, either through user charges or local&#13;
taxes. Attempts should be made to diversify local sources of revenue and to&#13;
develop incentives -- such as federal and state matching grants tied to local&#13;
revenue generation effort 1/-- for increased local resource mobilization&#13;
across all cities. For secondary centers, it might be useful to develop&#13;
municipal development banks that could make unsubsidized loans available to&#13;
localities for development investments to repaid out of enhanced cost&#13;
recovery.  This would help to offset any built-in institutional bias in favor&#13;
of allocating investable resources to metropolitan areas.&#13;
1/ Effort is understood as taxes collected as a percentage of the tax base,&#13;
however defined. Thus poor communities can have a high level of tax&#13;
effort.&#13;

D. An Experiment in Countervailing Policy-Induced Distortions:&#13;
Industrial Promotion Efforts in Northeast Brazil 1/&#13;
The Northeast formally embraces nine states plus a small portion of a&#13;
tenth. The area includes 35 million people, whose average per capita income&#13;
of 800 dollars compares poorly with Sao Paulo state's level of 4000 dollars.&#13;
The most important non-rural development program in place is an industrial&#13;
promotion effort which, over two decades, has provided substantial income tax&#13;
credits for industrial firms willing to invest in approved own or third party&#13;
ventures in the Northeast. The program allows these establishments to benefit&#13;
from income tax holidays, selected import tax and duty exemptions, excise tax&#13;
exemptions, subsidized long-term loans, and state and local government&#13;
subsidies.&#13;
Between 1960 and 1980, approximately 14 billion dollars (1980) were&#13;
invested in benefitted industrial ventures, of which 5 billion was in the form&#13;
of tax credits. It is not yet clear what the total dollar benefit of all&#13;
incentives has been over the years, nor how this compares with losses to the&#13;
region due to the application of sectoral policies discussed earlier.&#13;
It is apparent, however, that the benefitted projects have played a&#13;
significant role in Northeast industrial growth, though at a high cost. These&#13;
projects have accounted for the bulk of new regional industrial capital&#13;
formation per year. Simultaneously, the projects contributed to a substantial&#13;
diversification of output away from textiles and food processing. By 1977,&#13;
1/ The few existing studies in English are outdated and do not draw upon the&#13;
rich source of information used in this research project. This section is&#13;
based upon J. Redwood, "The Locational Behavior of Sao Paulo-Based and&#13;
Local Capital Establishments in Northeast Brazil:&#13;
A Review of the SUDENE-BNB Survey", Washington, D.C., Urban Development&#13;
Department Discussion Paper, Report No. 16, The World Bank, November 1982.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
roughly one-half of all manufacturing employment and value-added in the region&#13;
was attributable to benefitted firms, with above average proportions being&#13;
found in non-traditional sectors. All this was achieved at a high cost, with&#13;
investment tax credits alone representing approximately 15,000 dollars (1980)&#13;
per job.&#13;
The resulting plants were created by a forced march of investment&#13;
into the Northeast. Roughtly 80% of the investment resources involved are&#13;
extra-regional, if tax credit contributions are included. From this&#13;
phenomenon, several consequences appear to follow. First, the products chosen&#13;
for production and the technologies employed are such that substantial&#13;
leakages, benefitting Sao Paulo, can be identified. Overall, 91% of the value&#13;
of capital goods, 49% of the value of inputs, and 48% of the markets are&#13;
extra-regional, mostly in Sao Paulo. These tendencies are particular clear&#13;
when the characteristics of extra-regional headquartered branch plants are&#13;
considered. Second, the program has managed to break down barriers to long&#13;
distance branching, so that at least 20% of 1977 employment in benefitted&#13;
firms can be traced to GSP-based firms. Third, the incentives package offered&#13;
these firms proved to be the key to movement into the area: fully 77% of all&#13;
GSP-based firms declared that no project would have been undertaken in the&#13;
Northeast without the cited aid. 1/ Finally, the incentives have not been&#13;
accompanied by measures that could open secondary centers in the Northeast to&#13;
wider industrialization. Fully 60% of GSP-based emploment is concentrated in&#13;
metropolitan Recife and Salvador, thus helping to create new disparities in&#13;
the favored region.&#13;
1/ Among locally-based firms, some of which may have unidentified extra-&#13;
regional ties, 57% cited the incentives package as a prerequisite for&#13;
their decision to produce in the Northeast.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
Regardless of any benefits identified, this type of "deep subsidy"&#13;
programs is not replicable on a large-scale, for it consumes vast resources to&#13;
create a relatively small number of jobs. Furthermore, the heavy emphasis&#13;
placed on incentives by participating firms raises questions about the&#13;
viability of many plants in the absence of subsidies. All this suggests that&#13;
the Northeast experiment may not be a useful model for promoting decentralized&#13;
economic development.&#13;
VII. Conclusions&#13;
A. Understanding Urban Concentration, Deconcentration, and&#13;
Decentralization&#13;
Each city in a regional system of cities competes over time for&#13;
private and public resources with which to move toward its potential,&#13;
efficient size. That size and the rate at which it is approached can be&#13;
affected to only a limited extent by any public sector actions taken at the&#13;
local level. More important will be the particular stage of development at&#13;
which the region finds itself and the national institutional constraints which&#13;
affect the way private and public resource mobilization taeks place.&#13;
This situation arises because the potential employment size for any&#13;
given city will depend on the local composition of goods and services&#13;
produced. The potential size of any local industry will depend on several&#13;
factors. First is the relative availability of different natural and manmade&#13;
resources. Second, is the extent to which the established subsectors of&#13;
activity can lower their costs by reaping agglomeration economies through own&#13;
industry growth. Third, is the extent to which the size of the local market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
attracts footloose industries (financial and business services, high&#13;
technology manufacturing).&#13;
One might argue-that the manmade resources, at least, are subject' to&#13;
local manipulation.. This is true to only a limited'degree. The quantity and&#13;
quality of local'skilled labor does seem to be sensitive to the variety of&#13;
public services available at the local level; a concerted effort to improve&#13;
area services could have a developmental impact. Conversely,'however, major&#13;
regional transport racilities kexpressways, ports, railroads) involve&#13;
investments and coordinated area planning beyond any one city's capacity to&#13;
influence decisively. Many attractive city features, such as a-full array of&#13;
business and financial-services, and a large-network of local parts and-'&#13;
components suppliers, arise spontaneously.&#13;
National policies can, as noted, have a significant impact.&#13;
Discriminatory policies toward agriculture depress the hinterland around&#13;
certain cities that could otherwise flourish.   Industrial protection measures&#13;
that penalize producers likely to locate in smaller centers, or that promote&#13;
producers likely to locate in larger centers, appear to have substantial&#13;
effects. If the capital markets -- for private or public use ---are organized&#13;
in such a way that access is rationed by non-price mechanisms, then the growth&#13;
of particular groups of cities will suffer. For those who worry about city&#13;
size distribution, efficient-sectoral policies may be the most significant&#13;
weapon at the disposal of the public sector to nudge cities toward their&#13;
potential, efficient size.&#13;
Even then, however, account needs to be taken of the development&#13;
stages through which the region or nation is passing. No amount of good&#13;
policy-making will produce a large industrial metropolis or a flourishing-set&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
of industrial secondary cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in a poor,&#13;
small region.&#13;
Public and private resource constraints, and the limits imposed by&#13;
regional purchasing power and labor force quality on regional production size&#13;
and diversity, all these will dictate probable outcomes at any one point in&#13;
time. One should therefore not be surprised to find the early emergence of&#13;
one or two "city states" in a region, better equipped than all rivals, and&#13;
only a very selective development of some resource-rich secondary centers.&#13;
Elsewhere, small rural-oriented service centers will dot the landscape. With&#13;
rising economic development levels metropolitan deconcentration will&#13;
inevitably emerge, as will new secondary cities within day commuting distance&#13;
from the most developed cores. At this stage, policies to stop "sprawl" or&#13;
limit the geographic perimeter of a metropolis will be as futile as premature&#13;
attempts to "create" secondary centers.&#13;
B. Factors Promoting Decentralized Development: Illustrations From the&#13;
Sao Paulo Region&#13;
One fear that is often voiced is that decentralized development is&#13;
made almost impossible by the accumulation of clustering economies available&#13;
to firms operating in historically pre-eminent centers. Evidence from the&#13;
urban history of developed countries suggests otherwise, and confirmation that&#13;
similar factors are at work is found in South-Southeastern Brazil.&#13;
Once the most severe constraints associated with low levels of&#13;
economic development are removed; it appears that agglomeration economies are&#13;
primarily linked to the local size of the industry to which a firm belongs.&#13;
These economies are important -- typically cutting costs by 10% as an industry&#13;
doubles its size around the mean. But, even here, the cost-cutting effects of&#13;
&#13;

doubling industry size falls off rapidly beyond the industry mean. At the&#13;
same time, increasing city size itself appears to play only a secondary role&#13;
in decreasing production costs. Since growing urban population brings with it&#13;
rising land costs, labor costs, and congestion, a negative incentive develops&#13;
over time to expel established standard technology activity from the initially&#13;
preeminent centers.&#13;
Thus the basis for deconcentration is established, though only a few&#13;
proximate free-standing centers are likely to receive a large transfer of&#13;
dynamism from the metropolis through relocation of plants and opening of&#13;
metropolitan-headquartered branches. Other secondary centers will grow&#13;
independently, drawing on local entrepreneurship in the form of stationary&#13;
expansions and "births."&#13;
This can be illustrated by looking at the recent evolution of Sao&#13;
Paulo state. By 1980 urban population growth outside GSP exceeded that of the&#13;
metropolitan area in all size classes above 20,000 inhabitants, and was led by&#13;
the 10 centers whose population exceeded 100,000 in 1970. This was helped&#13;
along by similar trends in industrial employment growth: all secondary city&#13;
groupings grew faster than GSP over the recent past. Other indicators can be&#13;
marshalled to demonstrate tne deptn or the new industrial transformation.&#13;
Non-metropolitan growth cannot be explained by a fast growing mix of&#13;
industries. The typical industries of the secondary centers are not growing&#13;
rapidly by statewide standards; therefore good performance in these industries&#13;
in the periphery is due to other factors, linked to the improving&#13;
competitiveness of the area. Associated with this are other phenomena:&#13;
value-added per worker is converging across space, and there is a systematic&#13;
convergence in the broad industry mix profiles of the various subregions. As&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
the earlier framework would suggest, this convergence is clearest among the&#13;
group of cities located within 150 kilometers of Sao Paulo city.&#13;
Evidence gathered from the industrial censuses of 1970 and 1975&#13;
suggest that, statewide, industrial employment growth is due primarily (56%)&#13;
to "mobile" components; i.e. births, branches, and transfers. Furthermore,&#13;
births explain about two-thirds of the mobile growth. Looking across cities,&#13;
it appears that rapidly growing areas recorded fast growth because of high net&#13;
stationary expansion and high birth rates; the contrary was found elsewhere.&#13;
This applies even when looking at non-traditional subsectors of industry&#13;
across cities.&#13;
These data were supplemented by others, drawn from a random sample&#13;
survey of 591 plants newly located in Sao Paulo state between 1977 and 1979.&#13;
Transfers and branches tend to locate in the vicinity of the previous plant or&#13;
headquarters, respectively. Thus 82% of branches and 51% of the transfers&#13;
never left the city of origin; only 13% of the branches and 23% of the&#13;
transfers moved more than 30 kilometers from the place of origin. Most of&#13;
these were city of Sao Paulo firms, suburbanizing or moving into more&#13;
peripheral locations. Of this small minority of jobs, virtually 80%-90% moved&#13;
no further than 100 kilometers from Sao Paulo city. Beyond that all new&#13;
activity was overwhelmingly local in origin.&#13;
Taken together this suggests that it is crucial to shift from spatial&#13;
strategies based on long-distance relocation or branching incentives to&#13;
approaches that try to improve local conditions, per se. Some of the ways&#13;
this can be done are apparent when one examines the factors that underlie&#13;
plant location decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

C. The Links Between Urban Decentralized Development and Plant Location&#13;
Decisions in Sao Paulo&#13;
At the base of a system of cities lie individual economic agents&#13;
whose decisions jointly have a great impact of the fate of any one city. For&#13;
that reason it is interesting to explore the decisions of investors who must&#13;
decide on the location of a new plant, be it through relocation, branching, or&#13;
opening up an independent facility.&#13;
It is clear from interviews conducted with newly_located firms_in Sao&#13;
Paulo state that location decisions-are-rare-i-n-.the--li-fe of- a firm.  For firms&#13;
already in existence, new locations generally are prompted by the need to&#13;
respona Lo orner pressures -- ro expana,-roi=reorganize, or to enter into new&#13;
product lines.   Some of the reasons behind suburbanization and exurbanization&#13;
include deteriorating conditions in the metropolitan center city, reflected by&#13;
rising land, labor, and congestion costs. Finally, new, independent plants&#13;
o.e forced to chose a location as one aspect of starting a business.&#13;
The search for a location is therefore part of a complex set of&#13;
decisions. Investors tend to find information on market signals and future&#13;
trends to be difficult to acquire and -to interpret.  Entrepreneurs with&#13;
existing business face transactions costs if they wish to move, while&#13;
management coordination problems are posed by branching. Births experience&#13;
the burden of start-up costs, which create cash-flow problems over the early&#13;
life of the enterprise.&#13;
The strategy most often identified by the survey to deal with these&#13;
problems is one of limited search. Generally, the location of existing&#13;
facilities or of the investors' residence is compared to only a few, well&#13;
known areas, which are usually close by. In this environment, similar&#13;
conditions prevail in many respects (proximity to known suppliers, proximity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
to known labor suppliers) but land costs, road access to alternate markets,&#13;
the reliability or availability of particular utilities, and existence of&#13;
leasable space may differ. In addition, certain forms of "soft"&#13;
infrastructure (education, health, and recreational facilities) may vary to a&#13;
noticeable degree.    These differences are easier to evaluate, and trade-off&#13;
against one another, in the context of general area similarity.&#13;
Distant areas create the necessity for a more general evaluation of&#13;
factor markets. The survey suggests that recourse to widespread data&#13;
collection and evaluation is foreign to most firms. Firms do, in fact, appear&#13;
to ignore unfamiliar territory unless they belong to that minority committed&#13;
to a major move. Given this, it is not surprising that hypothetical or actual&#13;
packages of municipal incentives do little to alter behavior. Even more hard-&#13;
headed municipal planning, which accelerates the pace at which utilities&#13;
arrive in to industries in a city, must cope with the disappointing fact that&#13;
perceptions change slowly, and that immediate "pay-offs" are unlikely.&#13;
From this, some policy advise results. First, the mobility that&#13;
helps modify location patterns at the margin seems to depend on generalized&#13;
regional growth pressures that are beyond the spatial planners perview.&#13;
Second, limited search procedures provide a proverbial silver lining to local&#13;
officials: business expansion and new, independent plant formation in&#13;
secondary cities takes place, in part, because more developed, historically&#13;
pre-eminent centers are not considered in the new location/ expansion&#13;
decision. Secondary city planners thus have some breathing room within which&#13;
to operate. They need to consider carefully what specific initiatives may&#13;
make sense.&#13;
Several options are not credible. Planners cannot do much to create&#13;
a dense urban network of services. They can do little to create localization&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
economies. They should abandon the use of municipal incentives as a means to&#13;
diversify their city's industrial profile, especially when focused on&#13;
unreceptive firms located beyond the immediate commuting shed of the area.&#13;
It is possible for local planners to exploit their role as "god-&#13;
fathers" of the business community with the sector line agencies operating at&#13;
the regional and, less persuasively, at the national level. Anything that&#13;
provideg- for-the-rapi4,_coordinated introduction of public services at the&#13;
local level is beneficial to local firms. Improved services at the local&#13;
level can also help attract critically important supplies of skilled labor&#13;
without which much potential decentralized development will be blocked.&#13;
Pressure at higher levels may be useful, in. the long-run, in raising the&#13;
consciousness of authorities who deal with the disbursement of long-term&#13;
capital, pricing of agricultural commodities, regional transport investments,&#13;
and industrial promotion incentives. Finally, if local authorities wish to be&#13;
more creative, and can find the resources, they could bypass the popular&#13;
notion of industrial estates and work, instead, for ways to improve the avail-&#13;
ability of leased space in the community.   Beyond that, the initiative must&#13;
pass to the national level, where many policy reforms could be undertaken to&#13;
nudge cities to a more efficient pattern of expansion.&#13;
D. National Policy-Induced Distortions: An Agenda for Reform&#13;
National initiatives to "improve" the mix of cities in a regional or&#13;
national system by specific spatial incentives is a poor substitute for&#13;
efficient policies across all sectors over which the government has some&#13;
impact. The best spatial policy consists of good sectoral policies.&#13;
Empirical demonstrations of this are harder to come by than other areas&#13;
discussed, both because the methodologies required are poorly developed and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
beca,use the data requirements are large. Nevertheless limited research&#13;
findings and casual empiricism yield some suggestive results.&#13;
Non-spatial industrial promotion incentives favor larger, more&#13;
diversified centers and penalize secondary centers specializing in more&#13;
traditional lines of production. QSP, 'in particular, is rewarded, as are&#13;
nearby communities at the forefront of national industrial diversification.&#13;
Independent assessments, within and outside the Bank, suggests these policies&#13;
are undesirable on non-spatial efficiency grounds; they also dull market&#13;
signals implying new spatial patterns of employment. Those who argue that&#13;
such benefits will be offset by higher land values ignore the ability of a&#13;
metropolitan area to expand geographically.  Those who argue that returns to&#13;
investors will fall back in an on-rush of inmigrating investors, ignore the&#13;
creation of new own-industry localization effects in larger cities, as well as&#13;
the i1jpaCt of favoritism on the location decisions of the carriers of new&#13;
technolqgy.&#13;
Beyond that, there is evidence that, because of insufficient local&#13;
autonomy in the field, spatial disparities exist between the value and the&#13;
cost of urban services provide, possibly leading to lower than expected wages&#13;
in favored, historically pre-eminent centers. This would not eliminate or&#13;
reverse wage differences between center and periphery; it would however, lead&#13;
to a less-steep wage gradient than would otherwise exist, especially if heavy&#13;
subsidization of large centers continues over a long period of time. It is&#13;
difficult to avoid the conclusion that centralized systems for determining&#13;
services and charges, combined with revenue sharing formulas heavily favoring&#13;
well-established industrial centers, works against the interests of secondary&#13;
centers. Reforming, or at least reconsidering, these policies would surely be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77&#13;
more cost effective than spatial initiatives such,as those implemented -inrthe.j&#13;
underdeveloped Northeast region.of Brazi±.&#13;
If decentralized development is diff,icult to foster, it.may be,,first&#13;
of all, because it is an irrelevant option given'the particular stage of&#13;
economic development many regions are passing through.    Even if this is not a.&#13;
problem, far more fundamental reforms of sectoral-policies are required than&#13;
most governments'wi-sh to undertake. Efficient decentralization will not:occur&#13;
in an environment distorted by misplaced sectoral policies. In the final.&#13;
analysis,,local initiatives and isolated projects at the local level are-&#13;
secondary in importance to national reforms.&#13;

            Decentralized urban development and
            industrial location behavior in Sao Paulo, Brazil : a
            synthesis of research issues and conclusions
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report introduces the reader to the
            findings of a large-scale research project and only
            highlights findings reported in greater depth in project
            papers. Looking at a system of cities across the stages of
            economic growth leads to the conclusion that the potential
            size of a city at any one point in time is insensitive to
            most actions of local public officials. At the same time,
            economic development brings in its wake a transformation in
            the manmade resources available in secondary centers, as
            well as checks to further, accelerated growth in pre-eminent
            centers. For most secondary centers there is little
            opportunity to profit from a transfer of dynamism from the
            metropolis in the form of relocations and new
            metropolitan-based branches. The limited search for location
            alternatives is responsible for this. Secondary centers can,
            however, count on the expansion of stationary firms and on
            the generation of new independent units to help bring about
            growth. Local officials should concentrate on providing
            public services at the local level and on finding ways to
            increase the availability of leasable space for smaller
            businesses. At the national level the best spatial policy is
            a set of efficient sectoral policies.
