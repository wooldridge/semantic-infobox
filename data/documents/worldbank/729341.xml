Infrastructure Concessions, Information&#13;
Flows, and Regulatory Risk&#13;
Phil Burns and    Prices for monopoly infrastructure services have a history of controversy. But regulatory&#13;
Antonio Estache    experience in newly concessioned infrastructure sectors in Argentina and the United Kingdom&#13;
shows that even the arcane rules and data requirements for setting prices can end up being fiercely&#13;
contested. Regulators typically start the price review process with limited sectoral and corporate&#13;
data. To move toward more realistic regulatory targets, they must ensure that this information&#13;
base grows and that their ability to process it improves-a costly undertaking but worth the&#13;
expense. Getting it right-with well-conceived rules, data, and methodologies-helps to avoid&#13;
time-consuming regulatory disputes and contract renegotiations, reduce regulatory capture by the&#13;
new private operator, and assess who gains and who loses from utility privatization. Getting it&#13;
wrong can cause the concessionaire to operate and invest inefficiently, raise its cost of capital, and&#13;
ultimately jeopardize privatization. This Note outlines the accounting requirements that a regulator&#13;
should impose on new concessionaires to navigate these waters as smoothly as possible.&#13;

            Infrastructure concessions, information
            flows, and regulatory risk
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Regulators of concessions in newly
            privatized infrastructure sectors typically start the price
            control process with limited sectoral and corporate data. To
            move toward more realistic regulatory targets, they must
            ensure that this information base grows and that their
            ability to process it improves-a costly undertaking but
            worth the expense. Getting it right-with well-conceived
            rules, data, and methodologies-helps to avoid time-consuming
            regulatory disputes and contract renegotiations, reduce
            regulatory capture by the new private operator, and assess
            who gains and who loses from utility privatization. Getting
            it wrong can cause the concessionaire to operate and invest
            inefficiently, raise its cost of capital, and ultimately
            jeopardize privatization. This Note outlines the accounting
            requirements that a regulator should impose on new
            concessionaires to navigate these waters as smoothly as possible.
