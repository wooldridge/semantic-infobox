1. TRANSPORT BOTTLENECKS AND REFORMSI/&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1         The transport system in China has grown considerably over the last four&#13;
decades. Since 1952, the length of the highway system increased by a factor of nine and&#13;
the length of the railway network more than doubled. Despite this development, the&#13;
transport network is one of the sparsest in the world compared with the area and&#13;
population it serves. The main reason for this is China's low level of transport investment,&#13;
which averaged only 1.4 percent of Gross National Product (GNP) during 1980-93, as&#13;
compared with 2-3 percent for other countries such as India, the Republic of Korea and&#13;
Brazil. The transport system is also characterized by high intensity of freight traffic. To&#13;
produce one dollar of economic output, China handles 50 percent more ton-kilometers&#13;
(ton-km) of traffic than India and Brazil due to a relatively large heavy-industry sector,&#13;
reliance on coal as the major source of energy and a large volume of other bulk products.&#13;
These factors have resulted in a gap between transport supply and demand that is&#13;
manifested by the existence of transport bottlenecks, the administrative rationing of limited&#13;
transport capacity, the poor quality of services and losses to the economy.&#13;
1.2         The economic system in China is undergoing a major transition toward a&#13;
market orientation and this transition will involve many reforms in the transport sector&#13;
designed to increase efficiency and improve its response to market forces. These reforms,&#13;
which started in 1979, are now accelerating due to new government policies announced in&#13;
1992 and 1993 by the 14th Party Congress.&#13;
B. TRAFC&#13;
1.3          China had experienced rapid growth of traffic during 1980-89 when the&#13;
economy grew at an average annual rate of 9.5 percent. Traffic growth declined when the&#13;
economic growth slowed down during 1989-90, as the supply constraints became more&#13;
conspicuous. However, resumption of high economic growth since 1991 has brought about&#13;
a corresponding surge in transport demand.&#13;
1.4         Traffic Growth. Despite the capacity constraints and related bottlenecks,&#13;
since 1980 freight traffic has grown at 7.4 percent per annum and total passenger traffic&#13;
1/    This chapter is an abstract of the Bank sector report (No. 1 1819-CHA) China Highway Development&#13;
and Management Issues, Options and Strategies, February 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
at 11.8 percent per annum.2/ Highway freight traffic grew at the highest annual rate of&#13;
13.7 percent, compared with 5.8 percent for railway traffic and 8.1 percent for coastal and&#13;
inland waterway traffic. Despite its rapid growth, intercity passenger travel per capita in&#13;
China remains very low, at about two thirds of the level for India. This is due primarily&#13;
to the severe capacity constraints. Civil aviation traffic is rapidly expanding and has&#13;
grown 20.9 percent per annum since 1980, but still represents a small share of total traffic&#13;
with most long-distance journeys made by rail (Table 1.1).&#13;
1.5         Transport Demand and Modal Split Trends. Although the railway's share&#13;
of traffic has declined over the last decade as the share of road traffic has grown, rail&#13;
transport still dominates freight and passenger traffic in China. In 1993, 39.2 percent of&#13;
freight and 44.3 percent of passenger traffic turnover were attributable to rail, with the&#13;
remainder moved by road, inland waterway, coastal shipping, pipeline, and civil aviation.&#13;
This preeminence of the railway is due in part to the past dependence of the Chinese&#13;
economy on heavy industry and in part to the relatively long transport distances. In the&#13;
case of passenger transport, dominance of the railway is due to the poor quality and&#13;
inadequate capacity of the road system and intercity bus services, the virtual absence of&#13;
private automobiles, and the limited use of civil aviation. The movement toward a market&#13;
economy will increase demand for market-responsive transport services, favoring a shift&#13;
to road transport but still leaving a growing market for the relatively low-cost rail transport&#13;
system.&#13;
C. TRANSPORT REFORMS&#13;
1.6         In the past decade, China's economic reforms have aimed to increase&#13;
economic efficiency through measures designed to reduce national government intervention&#13;
in the production and distribution process, reduce the Government's deficits and subsidies&#13;
to state-owned enterprises, and open the economy by expanding trade and allowing further&#13;
participation of private and collective enterprises. In the transport sector, several reforms&#13;
have been undertaken in line with these objectives-many with Bank assistance. Notably,&#13;
the Government has:&#13;
(a)   reduced the extent of commodity price distortions by (i) decreasing the&#13;
volumes of commodities produced in the State Plan, and (ii) raising the in-&#13;
plan prices of commodities closer to market levels;&#13;
(b)   increased the tariffs charged by state transport enterprises, including&#13;
railway, highway and waterway, to levels approaching their long-run&#13;
marginal costs;&#13;
(c)   encouraged provincial governments to develop many local railways, which&#13;
now total some 4,400 route-km and interconnect with the national standard&#13;
gauge network;&#13;
2/    As indicated by turnover volume of traffic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(d)   allowed private individuals and collective and township enterprises to&#13;
provide passenger and freight transport services on roads and inland&#13;
waterways, and encouraged provincial and national authorities to develop&#13;
transport systems with private sector financing;&#13;
(e)   carried out major structural reforms in the organization and management of&#13;
civil aviation and in the ports, leading to increased financial autonomy and&#13;
accountability, and to less central government controls, thus paving the way&#13;
for introduction of competitive services;&#13;
(f)   reduced operating and capital subsidies for major infrastructure services,&#13;
through higher cost-recovery and increased reliance on user-funded capital&#13;
construction; and&#13;
(g)   encouraged the introduction of more modem technology in the transport&#13;
system primarily by improving rolling stock technology in the railways;&#13;
enhancing container and bulk handling capacity in the ports; improving road&#13;
pavement design and geometric standards for the expansion of motorization&#13;
in the highway subsector; and increasing the use of computerized data&#13;
processing and planning techniques in operations in all modes.&#13;
1.7         These initiatives are helping to spur the growth and modemization of the&#13;
transport system. However, much more needs to be done to bring about the changes&#13;
required to deal effectively with the emerging issues. To alleviate the transport bottlenecks&#13;
and rationalize the transport system, the Govemment will need to take the following&#13;
measures by the year 2000:&#13;
(a)   increase the total level of transport investment in relation to GNP, to expand&#13;
capacity to meet the new traffic demands and to clear up the backlogs&#13;
caused by past underinvestment;&#13;
(b)   aim for balanced investments among the major freight transport modes of&#13;
railways, highways, and waterways in terms of optimal economic cost of&#13;
transport;&#13;
(c)   realign further the prices of freight transport services and those of the major&#13;
commodities, especially coal, to bring them closer to their real costs;&#13;
(d)   increase further the productivity of existing transport assets through&#13;
technological modernization and management reforms; and&#13;
(e)   improve and expand the multimodal transport system, both across and&#13;
within modes, with particular emphasis on more extensive use of containers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

D. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR&#13;
The National Highway Network and its Utilization&#13;
1.8         The highway network totaled 1,083,476 km at the end of 1993 but, relative&#13;
to either population or geographic area, ranked among the sparsest in the world. An&#13;
estimated 30 percent of China's villages have no access to roads adequate for motor&#13;
vehicles. Investment in the highway subsector has been rather modest, at 21 percent of&#13;
total investment in the transport sector during the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90).&#13;
Since the early 1980s, the highway system has carried an increasing share of traffic. The&#13;
network is, for the purposes of design and technical specifications, classified by Ministry&#13;
of Communications (MOC) as Expressway (access-controlled highways with divided&#13;
carriageways for the exclusive use of motor vehicles), and Classes I, II, III and IV for&#13;
various traffic capacities in different terrain. For administrative purposes, roads are&#13;
classified as national, provincial, county, village, and special purpose.&#13;
1.9         China's road network consists mainly of aging roads with neither the&#13;
capacity nor strength to carry current and projected future traffic. Many of the roads need&#13;
upgrading in addition to normal maintenance and rehabilitation. A Bank policy study on&#13;
road deterioration in developing countries classified China among the countries with an&#13;
extensive and obsolete road network in need of modernization to meet the rapid growth in&#13;
road transport demand. Although China has not neglected road maintenance, its outmoded&#13;
maintenance technology would not be sufficient to arrest the accelerated deterioration of&#13;
the aging road system network. China needs to mobilize domestic and external resources&#13;
for modernizing its road system with special emphasis placed on technology transfer,&#13;
institutional improvement, and development of skills. There are few absorptive capacity&#13;
constraints relative to achieving these objectives given China's decentralized, stable, and&#13;
financially accountable highway administration structure.&#13;
1.10        The rapid growth of highway traffic stems not only from the country's rapid&#13;
economic growth but also from other factors such as the national policy of shifting short-&#13;
haul transport from rail to road as well as the expansion of the service sector and rural&#13;
industries. Furthermore, with the increase in foreign trade, growth in transport demand&#13;
will be concentrated in transport corridors serving the main ports and their hinterlands and,&#13;
with containerization of higher value commodities, most domestic movements of this&#13;
foreign trade are expected to go by road. The new economic activities have generated&#13;
traffic in excess of what many of the existing facilities can accommodate. Congestion on&#13;
roads resulting from the mix of slow-moving nonmotorized and motorized traffic is also&#13;
a serious problem.&#13;
1.11        The vehiclefleet in 1993 totaled 8.2 million trucks, buses and cars, mainly&#13;
gasoline-powered, with trucks comprising about 61 percent. Most trucks are of four-ton&#13;
capacity with outmoded designs and low  fuel efficiency.  These vehicles were&#13;
manufactured domestically and, until recently, the production of trucks was barely&#13;
sufficient to replace the retired vehicles, let alone meet growing demand. It was not until&#13;
the early 1980s that large numbers of modern vehicles were imported and joint ventures&#13;
with foreign manufacturers started to manufacture trucks and passenger cars. Production&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
of motor vehicles has grown steadily, reaching 714,000 units in 1991, of which 410,000&#13;
were trucks, 180,000 cars, and 124,000 were chassis, finished mostly as buses. This&#13;
production is contributing to the creation of a modem fleet, although the older vehicles still&#13;
predominate.&#13;
1.12        Growth in the truck and bus fleet has been fairly steady at an average annual&#13;
rate of 12.3 percent over the last 12 years, with particularly strong growth in small&#13;
passenger vehicles. Growth in the tractor and motorcycle fleets has increased sharply,&#13;
with motorcycles showing the strongest growth of all vehicle types.&#13;
1.13        The composition of vehicles using China's roads is diverse, including a&#13;
variety of motorized and a large number of other (non-motor) vehicles. The tractor and&#13;
motorcycle fleets, for example, at 5.4 million and 6.5 million respectively, well exceed the&#13;
size of the truck and bus fleet. Tractors and motorcycles offer a relatively cheap and basic&#13;
form of transport, but contribute significantly to traffic congestion and are among the&#13;
major causes of road accidents.  The domestic production of vehicles reflects the&#13;
importance of non-motor vehicles in China: in 1993, production comprised 41.5 million&#13;
bicycles, 3.6 million motorcycles, 1.3 million trucks, cars, and buses and 1 million&#13;
tractors.&#13;
1.14        The trucking industry consists of publicly-owned trucks operated by trucking&#13;
companies affiliated with local (provincial or district) highway authorities, and other trucks&#13;
operated by factories, cooperative organizations and, recently, private individuals. The&#13;
relaxation of trucking regulations in the early 1980's allowed own-account trucks to haul&#13;
cargo for other factories and cooperatives and thus promoted competition between public&#13;
and own-account trucks. In fact, nonpublic trucks have absorbed most of the growth in&#13;
traffic over the past few years. However, trucking costs are extremely high, stemming in&#13;
part from technological factors (poor roads, outmoded trucks, relatively low utilization of&#13;
carrying capacity, etc.) and from a lack of experience in fleet management, which is&#13;
essential to the development of modem and efficient trucking services. While market&#13;
forces are expected to play a more important role in shaping the industry in the future, it&#13;
is necessary to understand the current constraints to such development and to identify the&#13;
measures needed to allow the reshaping of the industry to take place. In order to explore&#13;
these issues more fully, a Provincial Trucking Study was included as a component of the&#13;
Bank-assisted Henan Provincial Highway Project, and a separate study of the trucking&#13;
industry was completed by the Bank in 1995.&#13;
1.15        Road safety is an important issue in the development of China's road sector,&#13;
as traffic continues to grow rapidly on all roads and a high-speed, national highway&#13;
network is developed. The frequency and numbers of people involved in traffic accidents&#13;
has reached serious proportions in China. The annual fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles in&#13;
China is 46, as compared with rates of 33 in India, 12 in Indonesia, 5 in Mexico, 9 in&#13;
Thailand, 18 in Hungary, and 2 in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom&#13;
(Table 1.2). A detailed study of road safety completed under a Bank-financed Highway&#13;
Project indicated that China's accident rate was one of the highest in the world, at an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
estimated 100 deaths per 10,000 vehicles in 1987. The social and economic costs of these&#13;
incidents to the Chinese economy reached almost $1 billion annually. 2/&#13;
1.16        The study also identified essential measures needed, including improved&#13;
police accident reporting; introduction of computer-based accident analysis; identification&#13;
of accident causes and dangerous road spots; preparation of guidelines for road safety&#13;
design; improved administrative procedures; improved manpower training; and preparation&#13;
of a road safety action plan. The responsibility for highway safety matters was transferred&#13;
from MOC and the provincial Communications Departments to the Ministry of Public&#13;
Security and its provincial units in 1988. This decision created transitional administrative&#13;
problems. These have been overcome in some provinces through good cooperation&#13;
between the provincial highway administration bureaus and the concerned public security&#13;
units. Moreover, the public security and highway bureau personnel often work together&#13;
to identify and improve road configurations at high-frequency accident locations. There&#13;
has been also improvement in the accident reporting system, as advocated in the 1987&#13;
study. In most provinces, computerized record systems are planned or are being installed.&#13;
Highway Administration, Planning and Finance&#13;
1.17        Administration of the highway network is the responsibility of the provincial&#13;
governments, through the Highways Bureaus of the Provincial Communications&#13;
Departments. Arrangements for administration vary among provinces; in the more&#13;
decentralized ones, the county and municipal governments perform some administrative and&#13;
all of the operational functions relating to the highway network. The central government's&#13;
MOC provides general policy guidance and support to the provinces through its nationwide&#13;
policies and regulations, specifying design and construction standards. At the project level,&#13;
MOC is involved in review and comment during the planning and design phases, and also&#13;
in regulating the import of construction equipment for major provincial civil works, as&#13;
needed. However, the Provincial Communications Departments are financially independent&#13;
of MOC and carry out all road planning, construction, maintenance, and operation of roads&#13;
and waterways in the provinces. MOC is more heavily involved in certain large projects&#13;
that are considered of national importance. The central government has in the past borne&#13;
part of the financial burden for key highway projects, but is increasingly constrained in&#13;
providing grant funding for the rapidly expanding national network. The key highway&#13;
agencies in Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province are described in Annex 1.&#13;
1.18        While the provinces manage the country's highway network, MOC is&#13;
responsible for planning and investment strategies for the development of the National&#13;
Highway System. A reclassification of the country's road network in 1981 led to the&#13;
designation of key interprovincial links as National Highways. More recently, MOC has&#13;
been evolving a long-term strategy for the systematic upgrading of the national system in&#13;
key corridors over a 30-year planning horizon. Known as the National Trunk Highway&#13;
System (NTHS), the system, comprising 12 major roads for the exclusive use of motor&#13;
vehicles (Map IBRD 25817) would connect all the provincial capitals and cities with&#13;
3/    The costs analyzed in this case included loss of life, injury, property damage, reduced productivity,&#13;
and medical, funeral, and legal costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
populations exceeding 500,000. Development of the NTHS system has been accorded&#13;
highest priority in investment planning for the highway sector. Construction of 25,000 km&#13;
of high standard, access-controlled roads of the NTHS is expected to be completed by&#13;
2025. Priority for early construction is being given to those routes already identified as&#13;
congested and hindering economic activity. By the end of 1991, some 500 km of the&#13;
system had been built, and a total of 4,000 km is envisaged to be completed by the end of&#13;
the Eighth Five-Year Plan (8FYP) in 1995. The provincial governments are responsible&#13;
for route location, engineering design, construction, operation and maintenance of the&#13;
national highway system. At the provincial level, in addition to coping with the routine&#13;
maintenance of the networks, priority has been given to the expansion and improvement&#13;
of the provincial, county and rural road networks, to provide for greater mobility and to&#13;
stimulate socioeconomic activity, particularly in the country's less developed regions.&#13;
1.19        A system for funding highway construction and maintenance is well&#13;
established although there are differences between provinces according to local needs and&#13;
circumstances. The main revenues are generated by the Road Maintenance Fee (RMF),&#13;
typically levied on the revenue of freight and passenger transport companies and on the&#13;
capacity of own-account vehicles. The RMF is levied by the provinces who retain the&#13;
majority of the monies after remitting a portion to Central Government agencies. MOC&#13;
also directly receives revenues from the Added Vehicle Purchase Fee, a supplementary&#13;
earmarked tax on vehicle imports and sales, and uses these funds, which currently reach&#13;
about Y 2 billion/year, to contribute financing for: (a) the roads included in the national&#13;
highway network, providing a higher share of financing for the poorer, inland provinces&#13;
and a lower share for the richer, coastal provinces, and (b) construction or rehabilitation&#13;
of rural roads located in economically less-developed areas. However, according to a&#13;
recent study by MOC, if funding both national and provincial roads remains at currently&#13;
budgeted levels until the year 2000, it will fall 30 percent short of the amount required to&#13;
develop the highway system in line with the projected growth in demand. The issue is&#13;
especially critical in those provinces with the fastest economic growth, where road systems&#13;
are experiencing the highest levels of congestion and deterioration.&#13;
1.20        In addition to its role in planning and financing, MOC serves an important&#13;
function as coordinator for the construction of priority sections of the national highway&#13;
network; in early 1990, MOC established a Technical Coordinating Unit to maintain close&#13;
contact with those provinces executing projects financed by the Bank Group. The unit's&#13;
main focus has been to provide guidance to the project executing agencies and to&#13;
coordinate staff training and the development of a Road Data Bank and Pavement&#13;
Management System at the provincial level, as part of a national investment planning and&#13;
prioritization system.&#13;
1.21        In summary, despite government efforts to improve the highway system and&#13;
its utilization and administration, much more is needed to modernize the system to&#13;
effectively meet the increasing demands placed on road transport, by improving both&#13;
physical capacity and management of the sector. The key areas, as reflected in the Bank's&#13;
recent sector work on development and management of the highway sector (paras. 1.23&#13;
and 1.24) on which the government should focus attention for improvement through&#13;
institutional reforms and training are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
(a)   the role of MOC, to be made consistent with the rapid administrative&#13;
decentralization taking place in the management and financing of highway&#13;
development and maintenance, and for MOC to be strengthened to carry out&#13;
its reformed mandate, particularly in matters such as finance; standards for&#13;
planning, design, and road safety; promotion of the NTHS; and training;&#13;
(b)    highway planning and investment strategies, to better identify short- and&#13;
long-term highway development priorities;&#13;
(c)    preparation of feasibility studies utilizing modem  highway analytical&#13;
techniques, based on data and relationships reflecting actual conditions on&#13;
China's highways;&#13;
(d)    highway maintenance, to be modernized through improved planning and&#13;
new technology in order to optimize network performance;&#13;
(e)    cost recovery and financing, to provide the necessary resources to meet&#13;
increasing financing needs for construction, maintenance and operations and&#13;
to encourage efficient use of the highway system;&#13;
(f)    operations of the road user services industry, both freight and passengers,&#13;
to reduce costs and improve quality of services, through promotion of&#13;
competition, modern technology and better management; and&#13;
(g)   the road construction industry, to improve the management, understanding,&#13;
and application of contract conditions; to modernize equipment, and to&#13;
clarify client, contractor and supervision relationships.&#13;
E. BANK GROUP PARTICIPATION&#13;
1.22         The Bank Group has supported initiatives by the Government in the transport&#13;
sector through loans and credits totaling $4.7 billion for 30 projects (Table 1.3). The&#13;
dialogue between the Government and the Bank Group on transport sector operations and&#13;
strategy has been strengthened through long-term strategy studies for railways, highways&#13;
and ports development, and through project preparation activities and project-financed&#13;
studies as well as sector studies carried out in collaboration with Chinese authorities. The&#13;
various studies have, inter alia, emphasized the areas of multimodal transport investment&#13;
and the setting of sectoral priorities based on systemwide economic evaluation&#13;
techniques.4/&#13;
4/  Six of the studies have explored multimodal pricing and investment issues in a more comprehensive and&#13;
more economically oriented analytical framework than was formerly available to China's decision&#13;
makers: the Guangdong Comprehensive Transport Planning Study (GCTPS); the Yangtze Economic&#13;
Zone Transport Study (YEZTS); the Coal Transport Study (CTS); the Railway Investment Study (RIS);&#13;
the Southeast Coastal Region Strategic Issues in Ports and Shipping Development Study (SIPS); and&#13;
the Price Reform Study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
Transport Sector Work&#13;
1.23        Recent Bank Group reports on the transport sector include China's Railway&#13;
Strategy (No. 10592-CHA) issued in February 1993, Highway Development and&#13;
Management: Issues, Options and Strategies (No. 1 1819-CHA) issued in February 1994,&#13;
and Strategies for Road Freight Development (No. 12600-CHA) issued in January 1995.&#13;
In addition, studies on the trucking industry and highway financing have been completed&#13;
under ongoing projects, a study of the provincial road construction industry will be&#13;
undertaken under the Fujian Provincial Highway Project, a study of interprovincial traffic&#13;
facilitation and a highway capacity study will be undertaken under the National Highway&#13;
Project (Hebei/Henan), and a study of intercity passenger transport is included under the&#13;
Xinjiang Highway Project. The Bank Group also conducted a survey of the national water&#13;
transport system in the mid-1980s, which has reaffirmed the need to further exploit the&#13;
large potential of the Chinese waterways. As a follow-up to the study, a multipurpose&#13;
inland waterway investment project was recently approved. Furthermore, a program for&#13;
institutional strengthening of MOC is being prepared and will be supported under the China&#13;
Reform, Institutional Support and Preinvestment Project. The main objectives of this&#13;
program are to strengthen MOC's capability in sector planning; to strengthen the collection&#13;
and analysis of data, both for investment planning functions and for performance&#13;
monitoring; and to provide consulting assistance in carrying out selected transport sector&#13;
policy and planning studies.&#13;
1.24        On the basis of its project and sector work, the Bank has an opportunity to&#13;
deepen its involvement and assist the Government in the design and implementation of&#13;
institutional and sectoral reforms in areas such as strategy formulation, investment&#13;
planning, pricing, financing, deregulation of transport services, operational efficiency, and&#13;
transfer of advanced transport-related technology through training and provision of up-to-&#13;
date equipment. Chinese authorities and the Bank Group are currently preparing a&#13;
comprehensive transport sector strategy paper that is expected to help guide sector&#13;
development in a consistent, cohesive policy framework.&#13;
The Bank's Experience and Strategy in Highways&#13;
1.25        Of the 12 Bank-assisted highway projects in China, to date only the first&#13;
Highway Project has been completed. The project, which was designed to construct and&#13;
improve 7 segments of the national network and 59 segments of provincial/county road&#13;
networks in nine provinces, achieved its original objectives and clearly demonstrated the&#13;
benefits accruing from improved accessibility to communities deprived of adequate&#13;
transport infrastructure in economically less-developed regions. Economic activity in the&#13;
area of influence of most project roads surged and income levels increased noticeably.&#13;
Furthermore, the Bank's involvement facilitated the acceptance of competition in the&#13;
contracting for road works in preference to force account operations even for smaller civil&#13;
works contracts, as well as the merits of supervision of construction by specially assigned&#13;
units.&#13;
1.26        The Bank strategy for highway lending in the medium term is detailed in&#13;
Highway Development and Management: Issues, Options and Strategies. The strategy is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
to continue supporting institutional development and sectoral reforms aimed at modernizing&#13;
the highway system and its management, and supporting investments focused on high-&#13;
priority links of the NTHS and the provincial road networks that feed into it.&#13;
1.27        While some institutional development and sectoral reform components such&#13;
as staff training, environmental protection, resettlement of affected individuals and road&#13;
safety will normally be included in every project, specific issues such as highway sector&#13;
financing, the efficiency and quality of road freight and passenger services, the&#13;
construction industry and other issues identified during the Bank's dialogue with the&#13;
government (para 1.21), will be addressed selectively in individual provincial projects&#13;
through studies, pilot reforms or other actions, with a view to formulating&#13;
recommendations that may also serve other provinces. During the next few years, the&#13;
projects' investment components will continue to focus on high priority links of the&#13;
national highway system, and to support the development of the provincial road networks.&#13;
The strategy also envisages continued close collaboration with MOC, assisting it through&#13;
economic and sector studies and through lending operations, to adapt to the evolving needs&#13;
of the Chinese economy. The issues expected to be addressed in Bank-financed projects&#13;
include the following:&#13;
(a)   identification of a structure for adequate road user charges and financing&#13;
mechanisms, in order to mobilize the necessary resources for road&#13;
development and equitably recover from users the costs of the highway&#13;
system;&#13;
(b)   promotion of adequate road freight and passenger services, including the&#13;
entry of private, collective, and township enterprises as reform of the&#13;
transport sector proceeds;&#13;
(c)   upgrading the capacity and effectiveness of the highway construction&#13;
industry, creating an enabling environment for the corporatization of&#13;
provincial construction companies, and opening opportunities for the&#13;
development of collective and private contractors;&#13;
(d)   integration of road transport services with other modes, particularly in the&#13;
field of containerization, and the establishment of modern, integrated&#13;
multimodal services;&#13;
(e)   planning and budgeting of highway expenditures, including monitoring and&#13;
control of monetary and physical objectives, and efficiency of disbursement&#13;
procedures;&#13;
(f)   organization and management of the highway corporations being set up to&#13;
operate toll highways;&#13;
(g)   highway maintenance management, including finances, resource allocation,&#13;
organization, and operations;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
(h)   expansion of funding for road infrastructure, including analysis of recent&#13;
Chinese and international experience with special emphasis on frameworks&#13;
and demonstration projects to promote private financing;&#13;
(i)   highway construction and maintenance costs, to analyze costing practices,&#13;
assess actual prices and stimulate commercially-oriented bid prices; and&#13;
(j)   other issues that may be of interest in individual provinces.&#13;
The proposed Shanghai-Zhejiang Highway Project supports the Bank's assistance strategy&#13;
for the highway sector through an investment component for construction of the Shanghai-&#13;
Hangzhou Expressway, a high priority, interprovincial link on the NTHS, and through a&#13;
pilot program of physical investments and technical assistance designed to improve road&#13;
safety in the project corridor.&#13;
F. LESSONS FROM PREvious BANK OPERATIONS&#13;
1.28        The Bank has accumulated substantial experience on the highway sector in&#13;
China through the preparation and implementation of twelve previous highway projects.&#13;
Of these, one highway project has been completed and a second was recently closed.&#13;
1.29        Bank experience in China shows strong implementation capacity for the main&#13;
physical components in highway projects and for expressway components in particular.&#13;
However, delays in implementation often occur for other project components: lack of&#13;
familiarity with procurement procedures and inadequate planning and design of traffic&#13;
engineering facilities (traffic monitoring, telecommunications, tolling, and lighting) have&#13;
resulted in the implementation of traffic engineering and equipment procurement being&#13;
delayed beyond completion of the highway civil works. Preparation of the proposed&#13;
project has specifically emphasized the procurement, management and operations of the&#13;
tolled expressway that would be constructed. The proposed project has also benefited from&#13;
advance preparation of bidding documentation for major civil works and other components&#13;
and independent design reviews, which should help reduce delays during implementation.&#13;
1.30        Land acquisition and the resettlement of affected people has also led to&#13;
implementation difficulties, including delays and cost overruns, in Bank-financed highway&#13;
projects in China and other countries. The proposed project covers a densely populated&#13;
and fast-growing corridor and, typical of the southeastern coastal area, a large number of&#13;
people and properties would be affected by land acquisition and resettlement. Bank&#13;
experience shows that the institutional requirements, including assessment of resettlement&#13;
impact, monitoring and reporting, are significant but often underestimated by project&#13;
authorities. The resettlement activities under the proposed project take into consideration&#13;
the previous lessons learned, and have addressed a wider range of issues, with greater&#13;
attention to technical issues, than previous transport projects in China. Preparation has&#13;
emphasized institutional capacity of resettlement agencies, strategies to restore living&#13;
standards according  to Resettlement Action Plans,   assessment of resettlement&#13;
requirements, funding (including provision for cost overruns), the adequacy of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
compensation for housing and other assets, the identification of employment opportunities&#13;
for affected people, and the establishment of effective monitoring systems for resettlement&#13;
activities.&#13;
1.31        The Bank has had considerable involvement with transport infrastructure&#13;
projects in both Shanghai and Zhejiang. A Shanghai Metropolitan Transport Project was&#13;
approved by the Board in September 1991, and a Second Shanghai Metropolitan Transport&#13;
Project was approved by the Board in September 1993.  The main infrastructure&#13;
component of both projects is the construction of 27 km of the Inner Ring Road around the&#13;
center of Shanghai; the projects also provide access via bridges to the new development&#13;
area in Pudong. The implementation of projects in Shanghai has indicated strong&#13;
capabilities in civil works design and construction, but relatively weak institutional capacity&#13;
affecting planning, design, and implementation, weak enforcement of traffic regulations&#13;
(in part, due to difficulty in interagency cooperation), inefficient public transport&#13;
operations, poor interagency cooperation, and lack of consideration of environmental&#13;
impacts. The proposed project would address several areas of weakness: first, the project&#13;
includes an institutional strengthening, comprising training courses and additions to the&#13;
equipment fleet that would improve capacity to plan, manage, and operate roads. The&#13;
environmental aspects of the project have been addressed jointly with the Bank throughout&#13;
preparation, resulting in specific action plans for the construction and operation phases of&#13;
the project that would be monitored throughout implementation; the procurement of&#13;
environmental equipment is also included in the project to improve Shanghai's capability&#13;
for environmental testing and management.&#13;
1.32        A Zhejiang Provincial Highway Project was approved by the Board in May&#13;
1992; this project includes construction of the Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway that would&#13;
adjoin the expressway in the proposed project. During the first two years of project&#13;
implementation there were problems with expressway construction quality and the&#13;
monitoring of resettlement activities. Measures were taken to strengthen staffing and&#13;
improve internal quality controls, and the project is now rated as satisfactory. The&#13;
construction quality problems resulted from the delegation of authority to lower level&#13;
agencies that were unfamiliar with contracting procedures, supervision, and quality control,&#13;
with negative impacts on construction quality, physical progress, and cost of the&#13;
expressway. Bank experience in many other countries has demonstrated that poorly&#13;
constructed roads lower economic benefits and vehicle operating cost savings, and may&#13;
reduce reliability and accessibility of the road. Higher costs may result from premature&#13;
deterioration, requiring corrective actions in the form of increased maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation. The proposed project has taken these findings into consideration. The&#13;
project would be supervised by a joint supervision team, comprising international and&#13;
domestic experts complemented by local staff; with terms of reference that ensure adequate&#13;
numbers of technical staff and quality control procedures. The project would also include&#13;
an important construction supervision training program to be held prior to the start of&#13;
construction. Regular Bank supervision would focus on the importance of adequate&#13;
organization, engineering, and quality control procedures.&#13;
1.33        Several of the most important lessons learned in implementation of highway&#13;
projects worldwide concern road maintenance. Bank policy papers in 1979 and 1988&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
underscored the fact that neglect of road maintenance can ultimately result in very high&#13;
costs to restore infrastructure, and that new road construction must be balanced with the&#13;
need for road maintenance. In previous Bank studies, the maintenance of China's roads&#13;
was considered adequate. However, the rapidly expanding network size and high rates of&#13;
vehicle and traffic growth in China suggest that maintenance requirements may accelerate&#13;
in coming years. The Bank is currently reviewing the implementation experience of Road&#13;
Data Bank/Pavement Management Systems components that have been included in several&#13;
previous highway projects. The proposed project has taken these issues into account, and&#13;
would strengthen the capacity for maintenance of Shanghai and Zhejiang roads through the&#13;
procurement of equipment needed for highway operations and maintenance.&#13;
1.34        Based on the. Bank's experience with institutional and policy aspects of&#13;
highway projects in China and elsewhere, the phasing of studies and technical assistance&#13;
and the intensity of Bank supervision are key factors in sustainability of outcomes.&#13;
Institutional components that are implemented early in the project period tend to have a&#13;
greater impact than free-standing studies carried out in the advanced stages of a project.&#13;
Bank experience also shows that road safety programs benefit from careful monitoring of&#13;
safety conditions and the impact of interventions to improve safety.  Institutional&#13;
components for road safety are most effective when geared to the capabilities of the project&#13;
agency, taking into consideration staff strength, technical capacity, and operating&#13;
constraints, and the success of road safety programs depends on effective coordination&#13;
between highway departments and traffic police. These lessons have been taken into&#13;
consideration in designing the Road Safety Program in the proposed project. The Road&#13;
Safety Program has been designed to pilot road safety-conscious engineering designs and&#13;
strengthen road safety practices. The scope of this component is small-well-suited to the&#13;
capacity of the municipal highway authorities involved in day-to-day implementation. The&#13;
civil works would be implemented in a manner to maximize the demonstration effect of&#13;
the program and to allow for learning from implementation of each works package;&#13;
regular monitoring and reporting is included to measure the impact of road safety&#13;
interventions. The Road Safety Program would be implemented early in overall project&#13;
implementation, which would permit earlier review and adoption of the pilot findings.&#13;

2. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN SHANGHAI AND ZHEJIANG1&#13;
A. SiTUATION AND ECONOMY&#13;
2.1          Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province are located on the coast of&#13;
China in the vicinity of the Yangtze River Estuary. As of 1992, Shanghai Municipality&#13;
had an area of 6,241 km2, representing 14 districts, 46 towns, and 23 counties. The total&#13;
land area of Zhejiang Province is 101,800 km2, but 70 percent of this is mountainous and&#13;
a further 10 percent is covered by lakes. The northeast region of Zhejiang, characterized&#13;
by plains, provides about 75 percent of the provincial economic output.  Jiaxing&#13;
Municipality, an area in northeastern Zhejiang that has been selected for a road safety pilot&#13;
program under this project, accounts for 20 percent of area, 21 percent of population, and&#13;
33 percent of industrial and agricultural output in Zhejiang Province.&#13;
2.2         The project area is among the fastest growing economic regions in China:&#13;
the economies of Shanghai and Zhejiang have grown by about 12 percent and 17 percent&#13;
per year respectively since 1985. Gross Output Value of Agriculture and Industry&#13;
(GOVAI) per capita in the project area was by 1992 well above the national average, in&#13;
regions of Shanghai ranging between 3.1 and 4.9 times the average, and in Zhejiang at 1.6&#13;
times the average (Table 2.1).&#13;
B. TRANSPORT NETWORK&#13;
2.3         Both Shanghai and Zhejiang possess well-developed, multi-modal transport&#13;
networks, heavily dominated by road and waterway transport, with a large number of&#13;
vehicles relative to network length (Table 2.2).&#13;
2.4         Road Transport. Between 1981 and 1993, the road network in Shanghai&#13;
expanded by over 1,500 km, with virtually all roads paved (Table 2.3). Key additions to&#13;
the highway network included the 16 km Shanghai-Jiading Expressway in 1989 and the 20&#13;
km Xinzhuang-Songjiang Expressway in 1990, the first expressways in Shanghai.&#13;
2.5         The road network in Zhejiang Province has expanded by more than 8,000&#13;
km between 1981 and 1993, and at the same time has been substantially upgraded (Table&#13;
2.3). The length of paved road has nearly tripled to about 7,100 km, 23 percent of the&#13;
provincial highway network length. At the end of 1993, Zhejiang Province had only 7 km&#13;
1/    Further information on the transport sectors in Shanghai and Zhejiang is available in Annex 1, and&#13;
in Staff Appraisal Reports for the following projects: Second Shanghai Metropolitan Transport&#13;
Project (No. 11985); Shanghai Port Restructuring and Development Project (No. 11120); Zhejiang&#13;
Provincial Highway Project (No. 10335); Shanghai Metropolitan Transport Project (No. 8465);&#13;
Ningbo and Shanghai Ports Project: Shanghai Port (No. 7257); and Three Ports Project (No. 3653).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
of expressways, no Class 1 highways and about 1,700 km of Class 2 highways. Most of&#13;
the additional network length has taken the form of Class 4 roads. The administrative&#13;
classification of the road system in both provinces at the end of 1993 was as follows:&#13;
Shangzhai Municipality            Zheiiang Province&#13;
km              %              km              %&#13;

Special                     130           3.6               789           2.5&#13;
Total                  3.625         100.0            31.924        100.0&#13;
2.6         Water Transport. Water transportation is well developed in Shanghai, with&#13;
a large number of connections to foreign countries and to eleven provinces and numerous&#13;
cities within China, including linkages to the Tai Lake system of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and&#13;
Anhui, and the Jing-Huang Grand Canal. There are 224 city- and county-level waterway&#13;
channels in the Shanghai Region. Typical cargos carried by deep sea transport include&#13;
containers, and piece sundry goods, and on the Yangtze River, coal and petroleum, steel,&#13;
building materials, and grain.&#13;
2.7         Shanghai Port, with a capacity of one hundred million tons, ranks fourth in&#13;
the world in volume of freight handled. The physical location of the harbor at the&#13;
intersection of river and sea permits trade with other main harbors as well as the middle&#13;
and lower reaches of the Yangtze River; Yangtze River connections contribute 16 percent&#13;
of the harbor's freight volume and 60 percent of its passenger volume.&#13;
2.8         Zhejiang Province possesses a well-developed inland waterway system, with&#13;
total navigable length of 10,654 km as of 1993. Inland waterway transport is used&#13;
extensively for movement of coal, industrial products, and building materials. The major&#13;
ports in Zhejiang Province include Hangzhou, Ningbo, Beilun, Wenzhou, Haimen and&#13;
Zhoushan ports. Several ports are being developed for deep water berth potential,&#13;
including Ningbo (Beilun District) and Jiaxing Zhapu to relieve pressure at Shanghai Port.&#13;
2.9         Rail Transport. The total rail network length in Greater Shanghai is 652&#13;
km. Specialized rail routes comprise 141 km. Passenger and freight transport services in&#13;
the hub area of Shanghai and the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou corridors are&#13;
administered by Shanghai Railway Bureau. The length within this corridor is 104 km.&#13;
The length of rail routes in Zhejiang Province is 847 km. The city of Hangzhou serves&#13;
as an important junction, with rail service along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang&#13;
Jiangxi lines. The transport capacity along the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
Xiaoshan-Ningbo lines are considered at saturation, such that further expansion would be&#13;
difficult. Rail transport is mainly used for coal, mineral oil, steel, industrial products,&#13;
building materials, general merchandise, agricultural goods and side-line products.&#13;
2.10        Air Transport.  Air transport services in both Shanghai and Zhejiang&#13;
Provinces are well developed and expanding. Shanghai is serviced by seven different&#13;
domestic airline companies, including international service from Hong Qiao International&#13;
Airport. Air transport has also developed rapidly in Zhejiang Province. At present, 68&#13;
flights are available, with routes covering some 78,000 km. Main airports are located at&#13;
Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Hangyan and Yiwu, with construction of an international&#13;
airport planned at Hangzhou.&#13;
C. TRAFFIC CHARACTERISTICS AND GROWTH&#13;
2.11        The trends in traffic in both Shanghai and Zhejiang Provinces reflect a&#13;
growing importance of highway and waterway transportation. In Shanghai Municipality,&#13;
nearly all (96 percent) of freight turnover is currently transported on coastal and inland&#13;
waterways, and about 70 percent of passenger tumover is transported by rail. Freight&#13;
turnover on waterways grew by about 8 percent per year during the past decade, compared&#13;
with 4 percent per year for highways and railways. For passenger traffic, turnover on&#13;
highways grew more quickly than on other transport modes, at about 11 percent per year&#13;
during the past decade, compared with 4 percent and 3 percent for railways and&#13;
waterways, respectively (Table 2.4).&#13;
2.12        In Zhejiang Province, coastal and inland waterways currently transport the&#13;
largest share of freight traffic, capturing 40 percent of total traffic turnover compared with&#13;
29 percent for highways and 31 percent for railways. For passenger turnover, highways&#13;
are the dominant mode of transport, carrying 68 percent of traffic as compared with&#13;
27 percent on railways and 4 percent on waterways. Highway turnover has grown more&#13;
quickly than other modes during 1982-93, at 27 percent per year for freight traffic&#13;
(compared with 3 percent for railways and 13 percent for waterways) and at 14 percent per&#13;
year for passenger traffic (compared with 6 percent for railways and 1 percent for&#13;
waterways) (Table 2.4).&#13;
2.13        Trends in the volume of traffic since the mid-1980s reflect the emergence&#13;
of air transport and the expansion of road transport for both goods and passengers. In&#13;
Shanghai, the volume of freight carried by road remained constant between 1985 and 1993,&#13;
while the volume of passenger traffic carried by road grew by 3 percent per year. The&#13;
fastest growing mode during the period was air transport, for which both freight and&#13;
passenger traffic volumes grew at 21 percent per year (Table 2.5). The volume of freight&#13;
traffic in Zhejiang between 1982 and 1992 reflects rapid expansion in road transportation.&#13;
Freight and passenger volume carried by road grew by 23 percent and 9 percent per year,&#13;
respectively. This growth was surpassed only by air transport for passengers, which grew&#13;
by 29 percent per year during the period (Table 2.6). In Zhejiang Province the growing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
importance of road transport is evident: 70 percent of freight volume and 88 percent of&#13;
passenger volume was carried by road in 1992 (Table 2.7).&#13;
2.14         Accompanying the growth in traffic has been a decline in the proportion of&#13;
traffic handled by public carriers, with more transport services provided by enterprises or&#13;
private operators in the highway and waterway subsectors. As indicated by freight traffic&#13;
trends in Zhejiang, the volume of goods transported by enterprises and private operators&#13;
has more than doubled since 1985 (Table 2.8). Development of China's trucking industry,&#13;
for example, shows rapid expansion in the influence of own-account operators. The&#13;
market share captured by own-account operators has grown at an annual average rate of&#13;
12 percent in the last six years, and by 1991 had reached 67 percent of all freight&#13;
movement.2/&#13;
2.15        In the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor, traffic on major roads is growing at&#13;
rates of up to 20 percent per year. The cities in the corridor are increasingly congested,&#13;
especially in Shanghai, where traffic volume of the six roads entering the central city is&#13;
already 8,000 to 10,000 vehicles per day. Interprovincial movements also contribute&#13;
significantly to traffic volumes and congestion in Shanghai. The mixed traffic volume on&#13;
interprovincial highways in Shanghai is nearly 5,000 vehicles per day, with volumes on&#13;
the key Huyi and Huquingping Highways already exceeding this level. Based on data&#13;
collected between 1982 and 1992, the yearly average growth rate of traffic in border areas&#13;
of Shanghai was over 20 percent, comprising 50-70 percent vehicles registered in other&#13;
provinces.&#13;
D. THE VEHICLE FLEET&#13;
2.16         The vehicle fleets in both Shanghai and Zhejiang have expanded rapidly&#13;
during the past decade. Total vehicle registrations grew by 15 percent and 19 percent per&#13;
year between 1984 and 1993 in Shanghai and Zhejiang, respectively. The fastest growing&#13;
vehicle categories during this period have been, in Shanghai, special purpose vehicles&#13;
(66 percent per year since 1991), cars and vans (23 percent), and tractors (22 percent), and&#13;
in Zhejiang, motorcycles (42 percent), small and medium trucks (39 percent), cars and&#13;
vans (31 percent). In both provinces, growth of nonmotorized vehicles (a category that&#13;
includes motorcycles) was 19 percent per year, exceeding growth of the motorized fleet&#13;
(13 percent in Shanghai and 17 percent in Zhejiang) during the period (Table 2.9).&#13;
2.17         The composition of the vehicle fleet varies significantly between the two&#13;
provinces, with Zhejiang Province possessing a far greater proportion of small and non-&#13;
motorized vehicles. The predominant vehicle categories in Shanghai are large trucks and&#13;
cars and vans (33 percent and 31 percent, respectively). In Zhejiang, the largest vehicle&#13;
categories are motorcycles and tractors (40 percent and 29 percent, respectively) (Table&#13;
2.9).&#13;
2/    Based on the findings of a recent sector report, China: Strategies for Road Freight Development&#13;
(No. 12600-CHA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
2.18         The rapid increase in vehicle numbers is having a major impact on the ease&#13;
and safety of traffic movements in urban areas of the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor. In&#13;
Hangzhou alone, 21,000 vehicles were added to the fleet in 1992, for total vehicles of&#13;
117,600, an increase of 18 percent over the previous year. Non-motorized transport added&#13;
another 1.12 million vehicles to the Hangzhou urban area. /&#13;
E. RoAD SAFETY&#13;
2.19         Road safety is a serious problem in Shanghai and Zhejiang Provinces, as&#13;
elsewhere in China. Generally, the number of traffic accidents has increased less rapidly&#13;
than the growth in traffic volume or vehicle registrations. In Zhejiang, while the absolute&#13;
number of accidents and injuries has declined since 1987, as has the fatality rate per&#13;
10,000 vehicles, the proportion of fatalities has been increasing, suggesting more serious&#13;
accidents with higher frequency of death C(able 2.10). Along the Shanghai section of the&#13;
current Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities has&#13;
grown steadily since 1986 (Table 2.11) with a large proportion of accidents in the area&#13;
occurring on the existing Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway (NR 320). Further despite recent&#13;
declines, the fatality rates for both Shanghai and Zhejiang, like those for China as a whole,&#13;
remain higher than rates in many developed and developing countries (para 1.15 and Table&#13;
1.2) .&#13;
2.20         While concern about road safety is high, the Communications Departments&#13;
in Shanghai and Zhejiang have not had complete responsibility for road safety since the&#13;
reassignment of road safety responsibilities in 1988. Much of the responsibility for road&#13;
safety activities now lies with the provincial Public Security Bureaus, including that for&#13;
vehicle inspection, driver training, public education on safety, imposition of fines, driver&#13;
licensing, enforcement of traffic laws, related traffic management, highway patrols and all&#13;
aspects of accident control, reporting, and investigation/research on accidents.&#13;
2.21         However,  China's  provincial  communications  departments  retain&#13;
responsibility for all matters concerning highway design. Typical activities handled&#13;
directly by the Shanghai and Zhejiang communications departments include: strengthening&#13;
the general inspection and examination systems for pavements, embankments, bridges, and&#13;
culverts; keeping the highway in complete, level and unblocked condition; improved&#13;
visibility of traffic markings;  prompt repair of damaged road sections;  regular&#13;
maintenance of roads; gradual improvement of technical (engineering) aspects that can&#13;
improve road safety; and improving emergency services.&#13;
2.22         In practice, many important interventions for road safety must be handled&#13;
by local highway management departments in conjunction with local traffic police. These&#13;
include early identification of damaged roads or dangerous road conditions (for example,&#13;
roads with insufficient bearing capacity), measures for decelerated traffic, one-way driving,&#13;
3/    The influence of non-motorized traffic is significant. However, since most non-motorized vehicles&#13;
are not registered, information on the total numbers of non-motorized vehicles is not available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
load limited driving, highway closings, and prioritization of maintenance and&#13;
reconstruction works in key areas. Red safety warning signals would be used at night and&#13;
combined with construction markings where highway maintenance and construction effect&#13;
the passing of vehicles. Specific measures to improve road safety are also envisioned,&#13;
including reconstruction of narrow or low tonnage bridges and improvement of alignment&#13;
(class) of highways, and separation of motorized from nonmotorized traffic. A pilot&#13;
program for road safety has been included in the proposed project to further the use of&#13;
these measures (paras 3.26-3.30).&#13;
F. HIGHWAY DEVELOPMENT&#13;
2.23        Expansion of Road Networks in Shanghai and Zhejiang. By the year&#13;
2000, the total length of road network in Shanghai Municipality is projected to increase to&#13;
over 4,300 km, an 18 percent increase over the length in 1993. The total length of&#13;
expressways is expected to triple from a mere 40 km in 1993 to more than 120 km by&#13;
2000. The composition of the network would also change, with expressways and Class&#13;
I highway representing an increased proportion of total network length (Table 2.12). In&#13;
Zhejiang Province, total road network length is expected to reach 37,300 km by the year&#13;
2000, a 10 percent expansion over the 1995 length. The length of expressways would&#13;
increase fivefold between 1995 and 2000. The proportion of roads classified as Class 2&#13;
and above is also projected to increase by the year 2000 (Tables 2.13 and 2.14).&#13;
2.24        Shanghai Municipality. Planning for development of the highway network&#13;
is a sectoral component of the municipal master plan, coordinated by the Shanghai&#13;
Municipal Engineering Administration Bureau (SMEAB) and the Shanghai Municipal&#13;
Planning Bureau in accordance with MOC's plan. Plans for highway construction are&#13;
made for a five-year period and for the year 2000. The 1986-2000 investment program&#13;
comprises the construction of 523 km of high-grade highways with total cost of Y 247&#13;
billion (Table 2.15).&#13;
2.25        The major roads providing access to Shanghai Municipality include the Inner&#13;
Ring Road in the central city, the Outer Ring Highway on the fringe of Shanghai, and the&#13;
Suburban Ring Highway, which together provide a high-speed ring road system linking 9&#13;
counties and 1 district. The municipal development plan includes additional construction&#13;
or expansion of radiating state and trunk (expressway) roads between the Inner and Outer&#13;
Ring highways. The Outer Ring Highway will eventually form a major, 97 km&#13;
expressway (50 km in Pudong area and 47 km in Shanghai) with 100 m width, including&#13;
a main carriageway with 4 lanes in each direction. Once complete, this road alone will&#13;
provide critical links to 7 districts and 1 county in Shanghai.&#13;
2.26        Several national trunk highway segments are also included in the Shanghai&#13;
highway development program. In addition to the benefits for regional and national&#13;
economic integration, development of these segments has provided a high-speed link&#13;
between remote and central districts of the Municipality. During the 7FYP, two such&#13;
links were constructed, the Shanghai-Jiading Expressway and the Xinzhuang-Songjiang&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Expressway, providing connections with two satellite counties. The major roads to be&#13;
connected with the proposed Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway are the Outer Ring Highway,&#13;
the Tongjiang-Sanya National Road (part of Suburban Ring Highway), NR 320, Maoxin&#13;
Highway, and Xinche (Class II) Highway. The Shanghai-Nanjing Expressway (under&#13;
construction) and the proposed Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway are situated along two of&#13;
the twelve NTHS routes in China. The interprovincial highways bounded by Jiangsu&#13;
Province are Shanghai-Taichang Highway (artery), Shanghai-Yexing Highway (NR 204);&#13;
Chaoe-An Highway (NR 312), Shanghai-Zinpu Highway (NR 318); and the newly&#13;
constructed Shanghai-Jiading Expressway that will be extended to Jiangsu Province. The&#13;
interprovincial highways bounded by Zhejiang Province are Xinjiang-Fenjiang Highway&#13;
(NR 320) and Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway (artery). These roads connect to the Pudong&#13;
New Area and are linked by access to the Nanpu Bridge, Yangpu Bridge, East Yanan Road&#13;
Tunnel, and Dapu Road Tunnel.&#13;
2.27        Zhejiang Province. Zhejiang Province has planned a program of major&#13;
road investments comprising the construction of over 1,000 km of expressways to be&#13;
completed between 1994 and 2002 and with an estimated total cost of Y 21 billion (Table&#13;
2.16).&#13;
2.28        The shortage of high-speed provincial or national roads has several national&#13;
highways pass through Hangzhou City, creating a transit point for traffic from the&#13;
neighboring provinces of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi and Fujian. In recent years,&#13;
the urban districts of Hangzhou have become congested with long-distance traffic, placing&#13;
more pressure on the strained intracity traffic. Improvement of transport access to&#13;
Hangzhou is a provincial priority that will also support the region's vital tourism industry&#13;
and economic development along the Qiantang River. Eleven key investment projects&#13;
related to development of road, harbor, and passenger (bus) services have been identified&#13;
in Hangzhou, with total required investment of Y 2.1 billion (Table 2.17). Other&#13;
investment priorities include the upgrading of a 1.9 km section of the Xianfuqiao section&#13;
of NR 104 as a north exit for Hangzhou City and the improvement of roads providing&#13;
access to the Hangzhou airport.&#13;
2.29        The Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor in Zhejiang has also been identified for&#13;
major investment. The two main roads connecting Shanghai and Hangzhou, NR 320 and&#13;
Provincial Road 01, connect 6 counties and cities in Zhejiang. Based on origin/destination&#13;
surveys and projections of corridor traffic, by the year 2015, the traffic on NR 320 will&#13;
reach 47,500 to 53,000 vehicles per day and the traffic on Provincial Road 01 could range&#13;
from 5,600 to 12,000 vehicles per day. Jiaxing Municipality, which occupies a central&#13;
position in the corridor, will be the site of several investments to increase corridor&#13;
capacity. In 1989, the Hangzhou-Fengjing section of NR 320 was upgraded and the&#13;
alignment moved to the northern outskirts of Jiaxing to relieve intra-city congestion.&#13;
Construction of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway would further relieve pressures on city&#13;
traffic: (i) the Shibaliqiao exit of the new expressway would be situated 12 km away from&#13;
downtown Jiaxing; (ii) Class II access roads in Wangdian and Shibaliqiao would be&#13;
reconstructed or upgraded; (iii) the Zhapu-Wangjiangjing Class III highway would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
upgraded to Class I or Class II;4/ and (iv) the Jiaxing-Wanjiangjing Class I Highway&#13;
would be rebuilt.&#13;
2.30        Projected Highway Sector Financing. In Shanghai Municipality, revenues&#13;
and expenditures in the highway sector are projected to increase at 12 percent and 5&#13;
percent per year respectively during the 9FYP. Total revenues during the 9FYP would&#13;
increase by 78 percent over the 8FYP level. The projected budget indicates a funding&#13;
surplus during the 9FYP, attributable to very strong growth in revenues. The most rapidly&#13;
growing revenue category would be passenger tax revenues, with a fourfold increase&#13;
between the 8FYP and the 9FYP. Road maintenance fee revenue is expected to increase&#13;
at about 11 percent per year during the 9FYP. Funds raised through bonds, loans, and&#13;
foreign capital transactions are projected at about Y 1.9 billion during the 9FYP, up from&#13;
Y 1.3 billion during the 8FYP. Total expenditures in the highway sector during the 9FYP&#13;
are estimated at Y 9.7 billion, compared to Y 7.8 billion during the 8FYP. Road&#13;
construction constitutes 76 percent of expenditures and would total Y 7.4 billion in 9FYP.&#13;
The fastest growing item of expenditure, apart from loan interest and amortization&#13;
payments, is routine maintenance, which would increase at 10 percent per year. However,&#13;
periodic maintenance expenditures would be sustained roughly at the level of expenditure&#13;
during the 8FYP (Table 2.18).&#13;
2.31        In Zhejiang Province, the highway sector budget for the 9FYP also shows&#13;
a surplus of funds. Total revenues during 9FYP would be Y 9.7 billion, a 54 percent&#13;
increase over the 8FYP level. Road maintenance fee revenues, accounting for over two&#13;
thirds of the revenues, are projected to increase at 9 percent per year. Other major items&#13;
of revenue, comprising subsidies or transfers from the fund for high-class highways, are&#13;
projected to increase at more than 10 percent per year. Total expenditures during the&#13;
9FYP are projected to total Y 8.9 billion, an increase of 35 percent over the 8FYP level.&#13;
Construction would comprise 75 percent of total expenditures, with expressway&#13;
construction the fastest growing expenditure item. Routine and periodic maintenance&#13;
expenditures would both increase by 66 percent over the 8FYP level (Table 2.19).&#13;
4/    The rehabilitation of Class II road sections in Pinhu City and of 6 km of Class II highway in Jiaxing&#13;
Municipality have already been completed.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. ORIGIN AND FORMULATION&#13;
3.1         The need for a high-speed highway link in the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor&#13;
was identified during Bank sector work on transport needs in the Yangtze River delta, the&#13;
Yangtze Economic Zone Transport Study (YEZTS). The resulting report recommended&#13;
priority areas for transport investment, including a network of expressways linking the key&#13;
regional cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Ningbo. Since completion of&#13;
YEZTS, highway traffic growth in the region has accelerated rapidly and the capacity of&#13;
existing facilities is being reached sooner than expected, lending urgency to the&#13;
recommended highway expansion program. I/&#13;
3.2         The main infrastructure component in the project involves construction of&#13;
the 130-km Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway to complete a continuous, 295-km expressway&#13;
connection between Shanghai and Ningbo, linking the most economically developed areas&#13;
of Zhejiang Province with the major regional port, commerce and communications center&#13;
of Shanghai.2/ The Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway would also provide linkages to the&#13;
Inner Ring Road and proposed Outer Ring Road in Shanghai, and would form a segment&#13;
of the Tongjiang-Haikou coastal highway, planned to connect Heilongjiang Province in&#13;
northeastern China with Hainan Island in the extreme south. This coastal route is one of&#13;
the 12 strategic, highest priority NTHS routes identified by MOC for major new&#13;
construction and systematic upgrading (para 1.18). The Bank is financing other segments&#13;
of the coastal route in Guangdong, Jiangsu, Fujian, and Zhejiang (the Hangzhou-Ningbo&#13;
Expressway).&#13;
3.3         It was agreed at an early stage of project preparation that, in addition to the&#13;
expressway component, the project would include a pilot program for improvements to&#13;
road safety in a segment of the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor where traffic growth is rapid&#13;
and accident rates are high.&#13;
1/    The Bank collaborated with the State Planning Commission in undertaking the YEZTS, a&#13;
comprehensive study of transport in the region comprising Shanghai Municipality and Jiangsu,&#13;
Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces. This region contained 180 million people in 1990 and generated&#13;
approximately 25 percent of China's Gross Output Value of Agriculture and Industry (GOVAI).&#13;
2/    Segments of this route from Xinzhuang to Songjiang (completed and open to traffic) and from&#13;
Hangzhou to Ningbo (to be opened by 1997) have been developed separately.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.4         The proposed project was prepared under the direction of the Shanghai&#13;
Municipal Engineering Administration Bureau (SMEAB) and the Zhejiang Provincial&#13;
Communications Department (ZPCD), with guidance from State Planning Commission&#13;
(SPC), MOC, and Ministry of Finance (MOF). The Bank's project identification mission&#13;
visited Shanghai and Zhejiang in November 1992, with subsequent Bank missions working&#13;
closely with central government and provincial authorities to formulate the project scope.&#13;
B. OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INvoLvEMENT&#13;
3.5         The proposed project has the following specific objectives:&#13;
(a)   to increase highway capacity in the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor in order to&#13;
relieve existing congestion and promote economic development;&#13;
(b)   to improve road safety in northern Zhejiang; and&#13;
(c)   to develop highway sector institutional capability in Shanghai and Zhejiang.&#13;
3.6         Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The main component of the&#13;
government's strategy for the sector is the development of a National Trunk Highway&#13;
System (NTHS), comprising 12 major interprovincial highways for the exclusive use of&#13;
motor vehicles; these routes would connect all provincial capitals and major cities (cities&#13;
with population exceeding 500,000). The construction of 25,000 km of high-standard,&#13;
access-controlled highways for the NTHS has been accorded the highest investment priority&#13;
by central government. This scope of construction represents a tremendous challenge: as&#13;
of 1991, only 500 km of the system had been built, with an additional 4,000 km to be&#13;
added during the Eighth Five Year Plan (1991-1995). The Bank Group is assisting China's&#13;
highway sector by financing the construction of critical links of the NTHS as well as&#13;
provincial road networks, by emphasizing policy and institutional reform in project-specific&#13;
investment components, studies, and technical assistance, and through sector work.&#13;
3.7         The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
discussed at the Board on June 1, 1995 and addresses one of the Bank's key objectives,&#13;
to help alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks. The Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor that is the&#13;
focus of this project is experiencing rapid economic growth: this factor, combined with&#13;
the density of population and increasing motorization, is reflected in traffic growth rates&#13;
of up to 20% per year and increasingly serious congestion.&#13;
3.8         The Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway to be constructed under the project&#13;
forms an important segment of the coastal route of China's NTHS, which will ultimately&#13;
link Heilongjiang Province in the extreme northeast of China with Hainan Island at China's&#13;
southernmost point. Completion of this route is an immediate priority of the central&#13;
government and the concerned Provincial governments. The Bank is financing or has&#13;
financed sections of this coastal route in other eastern provinces of China, including&#13;
Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
provide high-speed linkages with other key expressways, including the Shanghai Inner Ring&#13;
Road and the Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway (both being constructed with Bank assistance),&#13;
to form a continuous, 295-km expressway link between Shanghai and Ningbo. The&#13;
Shanghai-Hangzhou expressway, once completed, would link the most rapidly developing&#13;
areas of Zhejiang with the major trade and communications center of Shanghai.&#13;
3.9         Development of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway, a bi-provincial&#13;
highway, has also afforded opportunities for the Bank to help alleviate constraints in the&#13;
movement of passengers and goods across administrative boundaries and to promote&#13;
regional trade. The Bank's involvement in the project is helping to improve coordination&#13;
and cooperation between the provinces of Shanghai and Zhejiang, with lessons that will be&#13;
relevant for future Bank projects in China and more generally, for links of China's NTHS&#13;
that will involve the coordination across a large number of provinces.&#13;
3.10        Bank participation in this project has been beneficial to the highway and&#13;
planning agencies in Shanghai and Zhejiang by fostering the adoption of more up-to-date&#13;
technical and project management practices, including the use of design reviews,&#13;
contracting, and construction supervision. Because of the dense human settlements along&#13;
the project route, intensive preparation of resettlement components has been critical for the&#13;
formulation of strategies and action plans for income restoration of project-affected people.&#13;
The Bank has made a significant contribution to preparation of and planning for the&#13;
resettlement component by providing technical expertise for the assessment of resettlement&#13;
impacts and formulation of Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs), and by providing guidance&#13;
on how to meet the institutional requirements for implementation of resettlement, including&#13;
the monitoring of resettlement impacts.&#13;
3.11        The project's pilot program for road safety (the Road Safety Program) also&#13;
supports the Bank's strategy for participation in China's highway sector. The magnitude&#13;
of the road safety problem in China is receiving increasing attention as vehicle ownership&#13;
levels and traffic continue to grow at unprecedented rates, and as a high-speed road&#13;
network is developed, factors that could contribute to the already serious road safety&#13;
problem. Appropriate interventions and solutions for improved road safety in corridors&#13;
such as those in the proposed project, characterized by a high volume of mixed traffic with&#13;
a significant proportion of bicycle traffic, are still being identified and are of central&#13;
concern both to the Chinese government and to the Bank. Through participation in the&#13;
formulation of the Road Safety Program, the Bank has provided critical technical expertise&#13;
to help identify potential solutions, including road safety-conscious designs that would be&#13;
used to upgrade selected roads in the pilot and a program for strengthening road safety&#13;
technical capacity in provincial highway agencies. The Bank's continued involvement&#13;
during supervision would provide opportunities to give more technical advice on road&#13;
safety and to disseminate lessons of the pilot to other provinces in China.&#13;
&#13;

C. PROJECT DESCRIPION&#13;
3.12        The project comprises the following components: 3/&#13;
(a)   construction of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway, a 130 km divided four-&#13;
lane access-controlled highway, including service facilities and the supply&#13;
and installation of electrical, electronic and mechanical (E&amp;M) equipment&#13;
for tolling, traffic monitoring, telecommunication and lighting, and the&#13;
upgrading and construction of 56 km of crossroads at interchange locations&#13;
in Zhejiang Province to improve access to the new expressway ($605.5&#13;
million);&#13;
(b)   construction supervision of the Shanghai-Hangzhou' Expressway ($16.6&#13;
million);&#13;
(c)   the Road Safety Program, a pilot program in northern Zhejiang to improve&#13;
safety on highways in the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor after opening of the&#13;
new expressway, including&#13;
(i)  the upgrading of 86 km of National Route (NR) 320 road sections&#13;
and structures in Jiaxing Municipality, including construction&#13;
supervision ($26.3 million) and&#13;
(ii)  technical assistance, training, and equipment  to support the&#13;
institutional aspects of the Road Safety Program ($0.8 million); and&#13;
(d)   institutional strengthening of highway agencies in Shanghai and Zhejiang,&#13;
comprising&#13;
(i)   a staff training program covering highway planning, management,&#13;
design, construction, and maintenance ($2.5 million) and&#13;
(ii)  strengthening of technical capacity through the addition of equipment&#13;
for&#13;
a.  central laboratories, environmental management, and research&#13;
for the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway ($3.9 million) and&#13;
b.  operation  and  maintenance of the Shanghai-Hangzhou&#13;
Expressway and maintenance of the provincial and county&#13;
road networks ($14.9 million).&#13;
3.13        The section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway ("the Expressway")&#13;
proposed for financing under the project totals 130 km, linking Songjiang in Shanghai to&#13;
3/    Cost figures are estimated and include physical and price contingencies, taxes and duties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Pengbu in Hangzhou. The 28 km section to be constructed in Shanghai extends an already&#13;
completed 20 km section of the Expressway between Xinzhuang and Songjiang. The&#13;
terminal point of the expressway in Xinzhuang is about 25 km or 40 minutes' driving time&#13;
from People's Square in central Shanghai. The 102 km section to be constructed in&#13;
Zhejiang would link at Pengbu with the 145 km Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway now under&#13;
construction (para 3.2).&#13;
3.14        The Expressway would pass through a densely settled corridor that is now&#13;
experiencing very rapid economic growth. The corridor is currently served by two&#13;
highways: NR 320, which is the principal and most direct route between Shanghai and&#13;
Hangzhou; and Provincial Route 1, which takes a more circuitous route along the shore&#13;
of Hangzhou Bay. The comparative distances between Songjiang and Pengbu are 130 km&#13;
by the proposed expressway, 165 km via NR 320, and 174 km via Provincial Route 1.&#13;
The new expressway would reduce travel times between the celters of Shanghai and&#13;
Hangzhou to about three hours, compared with the current railway travel time of four to&#13;
five hours, and the current driving times of 5-6 hours via NR 320 and 7-8 hours via&#13;
Provincial Road 01.&#13;
3.15        Construction of the Expressway.  A feasibility study carried out by&#13;
SMEAB and ZPCD analyzed three alternative routes for the Expressway: the shortest&#13;
route was selected and engineering design has been completed. The design was undertaken&#13;
by SMEAB and ZPCD with assistance in traffic engineering by the Highway Science and&#13;
Research Institute of MOC and the Shanghai Railway University.  As a major,&#13;
interprovincial link in the national highway system, agreement between relevant central and&#13;
provincial government agencies and the Bank on project scope and formulation is&#13;
considered critical for successful implementation. Review of the Expressway component&#13;
by the MOC, SPC, and the State Council has been completed and approvals of the&#13;
technical aspects, cost, and financing plan have been obtained.&#13;
3.16        The expressway design includes 17 major bridges, 94 medium-size bridges,&#13;
22 small bridges, 27 crossroad grade separations, and 122 farm access passageways. The&#13;
final engineering design and technical specifications were reviewed by Bank staff with the&#13;
assistance of consultants financed under the Netherlands Consultant Trust Fund. It has&#13;
been agreed that project-designated road safety design guidelines be incorporated into&#13;
works on access roads under the project. The designs of Expressway interchanges were&#13;
also modified during preparatory missions following review by the Bank's road safety&#13;
specialist. The design incorporates principal recommendations resulting from these reviews&#13;
and is satisfactory.&#13;
3.17        The Expressway would be constructed to a four-lane standard as designated&#13;
in the national geometric standards for expressways (Table 3.1) with provision for later&#13;
expansion to six-lane standard. This added capacity is expected to be needed around the&#13;
year 2010 based on recent traffic growth rates of about 20 percent per year. In Shanghai,&#13;
the highway will be constructed with a wide central median for future additional lanes, and&#13;
embankments and structures for six lanes will be built during initial construction. In&#13;
Zhejiang, expansion to six lanes will be accomplished by adding lanes to the outside of the&#13;
carriageway in the future. Two major bridges and all interchanges in Zhejiang will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
constructed to provide the final six-lane configuration, but the initial embankments in&#13;
Zhejiang will provide for a four-lane configuration only.&#13;
3.18        Connection to the existing road network would be provided at eight&#13;
intermediate interchanges, in addition to the two termini of Pengbu and Songjiang. In&#13;
Shanghai, direct connection would be provided to the Shanghai Orbital Road and the&#13;
Shanghai Outer Ring Road (at Xinzhuang) and, via another high-grade link, to the&#13;
Shanghai Inner Ring Road; these connecting roads in Shanghai are at an advanced state of&#13;
planning or construction, the latter under Bank financing. The Zhejiang expressway&#13;
section also includes upgrading or construction of 56 km of crossroads at interchange&#13;
locations to Class 2 standards (Table 3.1), simultaneously with construction of expressway&#13;
interchanges.  Zhejiang Province plans to upgrade other key roads in the corridor&#13;
concurrently with construction of the Expressway.&#13;
3.19        The Expressway would traverse geologically difficult terrain with extensive&#13;
soft, highly compressible, soils over about 38 km of its length. The major expressway&#13;
contracts in Shanghai include a 2.2-km soft soil test section, involving the implementation&#13;
of mixed treatment remedies in about 20 sites along the approaches to bridges and pre-&#13;
loading of embankment. Experience in constructing the adjacent Xinzhuang-Songjiang and&#13;
Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway sections provides further reference for identifying&#13;
appropriate measures to mitigate the extent of consolidation.&#13;
3.20        The Expressway design includes only one access to Hangzhou via the&#13;
Pengbu interchange, and it is possible that traffic growth might overload the proposed&#13;
interchange design. However, the Wengmei interchange, located 12.7 km to the north of&#13;
Pengbu, would provide access to a new distributor road planned to open in 1997 and with&#13;
links to the Hangzhou Ring Road. Additional access to Hangzhou could be provided at&#13;
two intermediate points between Pengbu and Wengmei at a later date if necessary.&#13;
Zhejiang has begun construction of the Pengbu-Wengmei section, with associated access&#13;
roads, in order for through traffic between the project corridor and the Hangzhou-Ningbo&#13;
Expressway (now in construction under the Bank-financed Zhejiang Provincial Highway&#13;
Project) to bypass Hangzhou City; this section could be opened about three years prior to&#13;
opening the main expressway and would provide substantial immediate benefits.&#13;
3.21        Construction of the Expressway also includes ancillary works in the&#13;
Shanghai section, comprising pumps, approach roads, underpasses, fly-overs and bridges,&#13;
service area and administrative facilities, redirection of water channels, and landscaping.&#13;
These ancillary works would be completed without Bank financing, but are considered an&#13;
integral part of the expressway project. Progress of the ancillary works would be reviewed&#13;
by the Bank on a regular basis during implementation (para 3.79).&#13;
3.22        The Expressway would be operated as a toll facility. In addition to civil&#13;
works, the project covers the cost of electrical, electronic and mechanical installations&#13;
required for toll collection, traffic monitoring, telecommunications and lighting of major&#13;
bridges and interchanges. The technical and managerial aspects of this interprovincial toll&#13;
road are of particular concern to the Chinese government and to the Bank. As both&#13;
Shanghai and Zhejiang have limited experience in the construction and management of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
major toll roads, the Bank advocates early planning and preparation of E&amp;M works and&#13;
expressway operations. An agreement was reached during negotiations that by December&#13;
31, 1995, the Shanghai Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway Engineering Construction&#13;
Executive Commission and the Zhejiang Provincial Expressway Project Executive&#13;
Commission will jointly prepare, discuss with Municipal, Provincial, and Central&#13;
governments and submit to the Bank a coordinated proposal, addressing, inter alia, a&#13;
description of toll operations, toll setting arrangements, and measures to facilitate the&#13;
movement of traffic across the Shanghai-Zhejiang border. An understanding was reached&#13;
that, during the project's mid-term review (by the end of 1997), the progress made in&#13;
interprovincial traffic facilitation, toll setting, preparation of recommendations for toll&#13;
levels, and plans for expressway operation would be discussed with the Bank. Agreement&#13;
was reached that the Shanghai Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway Engineering Construction&#13;
Executive Commission and the Zhejiang Provincial Expresswpy Project Executive&#13;
Commission will prepare recommendations for appropriate toll lev4ls and will confirm the&#13;
organizational arrangements for the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway, taking into&#13;
consideration the recent experience of toll roads in China; this information will be&#13;
submitted for Bank review by December 31, 1998.&#13;
3.23        Supervision of Expressway  Construction.   Although independent&#13;
supervision of construction contracts is gaining acceptance in China, local staff still have&#13;
limited experience in supervising major highway works, particularly those awarded under&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Based on experience gained from the ongoing&#13;
Zhejiang Provincial Highway Project and other Bank-financed highway projects in China,&#13;
a Joint Supervision Team (JST) would be formed for the Expressway works in both&#13;
Shanghai and Zhejiang. The JST would comprise personnel from Shanghai Municipality&#13;
(SM) and Zhejiang Province (ZP), together with technicians from other provincial&#13;
institutions and international consultants. In addition, both SM and ZP would recruit&#13;
experienced construction supervision personnel from established construction supervision&#13;
companies to supplement existing staff. The JST would be responsible for ensuring that&#13;
Expressway construction works were carried out in full compliance with technical&#13;
specifications, and that strict quality controls were exercised on site. Understandings were&#13;
reached during negotiations with SM and ZP regarding a schedule for retaining the&#13;
international construction supervision consultants, the completion of a supervision training&#13;
program prior to the start of construction, and the arrival of the supervision consultants on&#13;
site before the start of construction. As a condition of loan effectiveness, SM and ZP&#13;
would each enter into a legally-binding agreement with international construc.ion&#13;
supervision consultants for supervision of construction of the Shanghai-Hangzhou&#13;
Expressway.&#13;
3.24        During  negotiations, understandings were reached  confirming  the&#13;
organizational and staffing arrangements for expressway construction supervision as&#13;
formulated during appraisal. A single firm of international consulting engineers would be&#13;
contracted for the JST, and the international supervising engineers would be integrated into&#13;
the organization with operational responsibilities.  Furthermore, the international&#13;
consultants would help establish procedures at all levels of supervision, including on-site&#13;
inspection and laboratory testing and supervision of mitigating measures identified in the&#13;
environmental assessment.  A total of 186 person-months of international consultant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
participation in the JSTs is proposed to be divided as follows: 144 person-months by three&#13;
engineers for civil works supervision; 21 person-months by one expert for supervision of&#13;
E&amp;M works; 9 person-months for supervision staff training in China and abroad; and 12&#13;
person-months as a contingency provision. Agreements were reached during negotiations&#13;
from SM and ZP that supervision teams with qualified staff in adequate numbers will be&#13;
maintained to ensure that works are carried out in accordance with technical specifications&#13;
and that strict quality controls are exercised on site.&#13;
3.25        A training program in construction supervision to be completed prior to the&#13;
mobilization of contractors has been established for all local staff supervising construction&#13;
of the expressway. All construction supervision training would be conducted by the&#13;
international construction supervision consultants. The first phase of the training program,&#13;
prior to the beginning of construction, would include lecture courses and site visits. The&#13;
second phase comprises on-the-job training that would take place during construction of&#13;
the expressway. The timing and location of the training sessions would be coordinated&#13;
between Shanghai and Zhejiang in order to maximize exposure for the participating staff.&#13;
Understandings concerning the scope and duration of this training were reached with SM&#13;
and ZP during negotiations.&#13;
3.26        Road Safety Program. The Road Safety Program (RSP) is a pilot program&#13;
constructed around observed characteristics of the traffic and infrastructure in a specific&#13;
section of the project corridor. The resources of the RSP would be focussed in Jiaxing&#13;
Municipality of Zhejiang Province; Shanghai would have no involvement in the RSP.&#13;
Greater Jiaxing was selected for the pilot program because it occupies a central position,&#13;
is in a heavily trafficked area, and contains a large share of the existing road length. The&#13;
RSP primarily focuses on improvements to highway infrastructure to promote road safety,&#13;
but would also cover the provision of equipment, training, and technical assistance for&#13;
institutional development. During negotiations, an understanding was reached that the civil&#13;
works, training, technical assistance, and procurement of equipment for the Road Safety&#13;
Program have been approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government and are part of the&#13;
Provincial investment plan.&#13;
3.27        The interaction of fast- and slow-moving motorized vehicles, slow motorized&#13;
and non-motorized vehicles, and the interaction of pedestrians with vehicles in Jiaxing&#13;
contribute to a high level of accidents. One of the main emphases of the pilot program,&#13;
the segregation of vehicle types, could in the Chinese context contribute to a reduction in&#13;
accidents and an increase in capacity. The two key infrastructure improvements for&#13;
improving road safety under the RSP pilot are: (a) segregation of motor vehicle traffic&#13;
from bicycles and agricultural tractors; and (b) improvement of road junctions to ensure&#13;
that minor road traffic can turn safely into and out of the main road.&#13;
3.28        Zhejiang authorities have proposed improvements to nine sections (86 km)&#13;
of NR 320, the main highway passing through the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor (para.&#13;
3.12), where 60 percent of all road accidents in Jiaxing Municipality occur. In 1992, over&#13;
2,700 road accidents occurred in Jiaxing, including 268 fatalities and 357 serious injuries.&#13;
The number of accidents has increased five hundred percent during the last 10 years.&#13;
Works under the RSP include the provision of separate "slow vehicle" lanes on both sides,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
the rebuilding of 2 bridges, the widening of an additional 80 bridges and/or culverts, and&#13;
the improvement of 37 junctions with provincial or county roads and 140 junctions with&#13;
agricultural tractor roads. Zhejiang plans to use its own resources to upgrade an additional&#13;
9 large bridges to improve road safety in the Jiaxing area. The proposals for RSP works,&#13;
reviewed in detail during appraisal, are supported by sketch plans showing typical cross-&#13;
sections and junction improvements. Road safety issues and the proposed RSP are&#13;
discussed in greater detail in Annex 2.&#13;
3.29        Construction of the sections would be supervised by the transport bureaus&#13;
at the county and municipal levels, under the overall supervision of ZPHAB, and by&#13;
locally-recruited construction supervision consultants. While this arrangement would&#13;
provide the staff strength required for supervision of works, their laboratory testing&#13;
facilities would need strengthening by the addition of laboratory. equipment purchased&#13;
under the project.&#13;
3.30        Works on the nine road sections included in the RSP would be implemented&#13;
in a manner to minimize disruption of traffic on the already congested NR 320 and to&#13;
maximize the benefit of a pilot approach. The RSP sections have been prepared based on&#13;
analyses of local road safety conditions, economic evaluation, engineering design, bidding&#13;
documents, environmental assessment and/or environmental action plans, and resettlement&#13;
action plans. The economic evaluations, environmental assessment and action plan, and&#13;
a resettlement action plan covering all sections under the RSP have been completed and&#13;
are satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations, agreements were reached that, prior to&#13;
commencing upgrading on any RSP section, the Bank will receive and approve: (a) a&#13;
detailed description of the design and technical aspects of the package, that must meet&#13;
engineering design standards acceptable to the Bank; (b) a description of construction&#13;
supervision arrangements for the package; (c) layout plans for all junction types in the&#13;
package; and (d) a report containing an assessment of the likely impact of the works on&#13;
road safety. The receipt and approval of this information is a condition of disbursement.&#13;
3.31        RSP Technical Assistance. Details of an RSP technical assistance and&#13;
training package was included in Annex 2. The technical assistance and training is&#13;
designed to provide long-term benefits to the corridor by changing the methodology used&#13;
to devise accident remedial measures.  The current system is weak both in causal&#13;
identification and in the design of remedial measures. Project technical assistance and&#13;
training would help address these areas through: (a) basic accident information and&#13;
analysis; (b) provision of a Road Safety Manual and Safety Audit System; and&#13;
(c) specialized training. The adoption of monitoring and reporting systems to measure the&#13;
impact of the proposed road safety interventions is a critical next step. Agreements were&#13;
reached from ZP at negotiations that monitoring for the pilot subprojects will be carried&#13;
out quarterly, in a manner agreed with the Bank, and that monitoring reports will be&#13;
submitted to the Bank for review.&#13;
3.32        Staff Training. In addition to the training of local staff in construction&#13;
supervision, a series of training programs would be conducted in transport and highway&#13;
engineering and related areas. According to the nature of the training, the courses would&#13;
be provided either in China, by local institutions, or abroad, through training institutions&#13;
of national or state road authorities, and in some cases, by consultants. The main training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
courses for provincial transport/highway personnel cover: highway planning, traffic survey&#13;
and analysis, financial management of highway projects, project planning and feasibility&#13;
studies, elements of project design (geometry, pavement, soft soil treatment, project cost&#13;
estimates), project implementation and supervision (contracting, quality control), and&#13;
highway operation, maintenance and management systems. The main training programs,&#13;
shown in detail in Tables 3.2 and 3.3, will train about 221 staff for about 265 person-&#13;
months. At negotiations, the training programs were confirmed and assurances obtained&#13;
that all training programs under the project will be carried out under terms of reference&#13;
(TOR) and in a manner satisfactory to the Bank and that, by September 30 of each year&#13;
beginning in 1996, detailed proposals for all training under the project to be conducted&#13;
during the next two calendar years will be submitted for Bank approval.&#13;
3.33        Provision of Equipment for Institutional Strengthening. Equipment&#13;
would be supplied under the project to assist construction supervisionb research, operation&#13;
and maintenance of the expressway and other principal roads and for the road safety&#13;
program. The main equipment needs are:&#13;
(a)   laboratory equipment to support construction supervision activities,&#13;
particularly for soils and asphalt pavement;&#13;
(b)   instruments to assist in research related to soft-soil treatment and pavement&#13;
and bridge design;&#13;
(c)   instruments to monitor environmental aspects during construction and&#13;
subsequent operation of the expressway, as stipulated in the Environmental&#13;
Action Plan (EAP);&#13;
(d)   vehicles and other equipment for the operation and maintenance of the&#13;
project after opening, including emergency equipment; and&#13;
(e)   for the Road Safety Program, two microcomputers with copies in English&#13;
and Chinese of the Microcomputer Accident Analysis Package (MAAP)&#13;
developed by the UK Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL).&#13;
A list of equipment for (a) through (d) above was confirmed at negotiations (Tables 3.4,&#13;
3.5 and 3.6, with a summary of project equipment cost in Table 3.7).&#13;
D. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
3.34        Preparation of the proposed project is well-advanced, with implementation&#13;
of the major civil works component scheduled to begin in September 1995. The project&#13;
sustained numerous delays during preparation: the complexity of this major, bi-provincial&#13;
project resulted in a complex and lengthy government approval process; the ongoing&#13;
Zhejiang Provincial Highway Project experienced implementation difficulties in mid-1994,&#13;
and the Bank required remedial actions before processing of the proposed project could&#13;
proceed; and Shanghai and Zhejiang were required to do additional preparatory work on&#13;
the resettlement aspects for all components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
3.35        The most advanced activities of the project include: construction of an&#13;
initial section of the expressway in Zhejiang that began in February 1994; a soft soil test&#13;
section, part of the expressway works in Shanghai, scheduled to begin in August 1995;&#13;
the resettlement for the Zhejiang expressway section and for the Road Safety Program has&#13;
been completed; and the resettlement for the Shanghai expressway section is scheduled to&#13;
begin in late July 1995. All resettlement activities are being carried out according to&#13;
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) found acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for expressway&#13;
construction have been or will soon be awarded with contractors expected to mobilize by&#13;
September 1995. The selection of consultants to supervise construction of the expressway&#13;
and to conduct training in construction supervision prior to the beginning of construction&#13;
will be completed by the end of July 1995, to allow adequate time for construction&#13;
supervision training prior to commencement of construction. To facilitate current road&#13;
maintenance operations, the Shanghai-Highway Management Department is procuring in&#13;
advance certain equipment from the agreed equipment list for Shanghai (Table 3.4). These&#13;
items of equipment will remain as part of the project but will not be financed by the Bank.&#13;
E. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
3.36        Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway. Environmental Assessments (EAs) were&#13;
carried out for the Shanghai and Zhejiang sections of the project expressway by the&#13;
Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences (SAES) and the Zhejiang Provincial&#13;
Research Institute of Environmental Protection (ZPRIEP), respectively.  The EAs&#13;
identified social disruption, noise, air pollution, water pollution, soil erosion, effects on&#13;
irrigation systems, etc., as major potential impacts. Based on the EA findings and&#13;
subsequent to discussions between representatives of SM, ZP and the Bank, Environmental&#13;
Action Plans (EAPs) for the expressway were prepared and submitted to the Bank for&#13;
review. The EAs and EAPs are satisfactory to the Bank. It has been ascertained that the&#13;
expressway would not affect ecologically sensitive areas and that, if appropriate measures&#13;
are taken, expressway construction and operation should have no significant adverse impact&#13;
on the environment.&#13;
3.37        The EAPs specified  the  measures, organizations and  monitoring&#13;
arrangements required to mitigate the potential adverse effects on the environment during&#13;
the construction and operation of the Expressway. The main measures relate to social&#13;
disruption, noise, air quality including dust, soil erosion and water management, control&#13;
of construction traffic, operation of quarries, and waste disposal. The engineering design&#13;
and technical specifications for the Expressway have incorporated appropriate measures&#13;
required to be taken for environmental protection.   Appropriate administrative&#13;
arrangements have been identified to ensure the enforcement of such measures during the&#13;
construction and operation of the Expressway. Summaries of the EAs and EAPs are&#13;
presented in Annex 3 and copies of the full EAs and EAPs are available in the Project&#13;
File. Agreements were reached from SM and ZP at negotiations that the environmental&#13;
protection measures stipulated in the EAPs with respect to the Shanghai-Hangzhou&#13;
Expressway will be carried out in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
3.38        Road Safety Program. Since most of the works under the RSP would be&#13;
directed to the upgrading of existing facilities, they are not expected to have significant&#13;
impacts on the environment. Nevertheless, in order to fully mitigate potentially adverse&#13;
effects of this program, an EA for the RSP has been carried out by the Environmental&#13;
Protection Institute of Zhejiang Province. Based on findings of the EA, an EAP was&#13;
prepared and found satisfactory to the Bank. An assurance was obtained from ZP at&#13;
negotiations that the environmental protection measures stipulated in the EAPs with respect&#13;
to the RSP will be carried out in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
F. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESE'rLEMENT&#13;
3.39        The resettlement aspects of the proposed project have received considerable&#13;
attention from the Bank since the preparation of a first Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)&#13;
in 1993.  The extensive preparation of resettlement aspects that has ensued was&#13;
necessitated by: (a) the project's large scale resettlement impact, with more than 55,000&#13;
people affected by the loss of land, employment, and assets; (b) the implementing&#13;
agencies' limited experience in preparing and implementing RAPs consistent with Bank&#13;
guidelines; (c) and the Bank's increasing awareness and ability to assist the Chinese&#13;
government to address the complex issues related to resettlement.&#13;
3.40        Current Status of Resettlement. The advanced state of preparation of this&#13;
project, with an estimated start of major construction in September 1995 and advance&#13;
construction of an expressway section in Zhejiang, is atypical and has resulted in&#13;
implementation of resettlement prior to Board approval. All resettlement activities in&#13;
Zhejiang Province have been completed and an initial internal monitoring report on&#13;
resettlement in Zhejiang has been submitted to the Bank. Resettlement in Shanghai would&#13;
begin in late July 1995 and estimated to be completed by October 1995. The early&#13;
resettlement was implemented in a manner consistent with RAPs that were largely&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank but still under discussion.  In order to ensure equity and&#13;
consistency of resettlement activities, Shanghai and Zhejiang are applying the principles,&#13;
eligibility criteria, and compensation standards of the final revised RAP retroactively, so&#13;
that all project-affected people are resettled according to RAPs found acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. In Zhejiang Province, where this retroactive provision is relevant, all retroactive&#13;
compensation will be paid before the end of July 1995. Retroactivity is not applicable in&#13;
Shanghai because all resettlement will be carried out according to the final, revised RAP&#13;
found acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.41        Background. Land acquisition and resettlement activities along the Pengbu-&#13;
Wengmei advance contracting section in Zhejiang were completed between October 1993&#13;
and April 1994. In order to ensure that land acquisition and resettlement was carried out&#13;
satisfactorily, the Bank requested that an evaluation of the resettlement activities be&#13;
prepared by an independent monitoring institution.  The resulting report indicated&#13;
satisfactory completion of relocation activities, but cited delays in the process of providing&#13;
eligible people with employment in enterprises. The employment placement process for&#13;
the Pengbu-Wengmei section was completed by November 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
3.42         The process and strategies used for resettlement in this advance contracting&#13;
section, and further, early lessons learned from implementation of resettlement in this&#13;
section and under other projects in China, were scrutinized and, in most areas, the&#13;
approach to resettlement strengthened as reflected in the final, revised RAPs for all project&#13;
components. During early phases of project planning, highway design institutes carried&#13;
out surveys documenting the adverse impact of the project on lands, houses, infrastructure,&#13;
and other collectively or individually held assets in the project area, as is regular practice&#13;
for highway projects in China. However, the Bank's concerns about the large number of&#13;
people affected by this project and the provinces' limited previous experience with&#13;
formulating RAPs warranted more intensive preparation of the project's resettlement&#13;
activities. In late 1994, both Shanghai and Zhejiang, with the assistance of specialized&#13;
agencies, initiated a socio-economic survey of the project area to: (a) verify the results of&#13;
the earlier census surveys; and (b) establish a baseline of income levels and socio-economic&#13;
conditions (including assets held) of the affected population. The detailed data from socio-&#13;
economic surveys provided the basis for revised RAPs.&#13;
3.43         During subsequent preparation with assistance from the Bank's technical&#13;
experts, other aspects of the resettlement process and the RAPs were addressed in depth,&#13;
including: (a) the establishment of a policy framework to ensure that living standards for&#13;
all categories of affected persons are, at a minimum, restored; (b) the establishment of&#13;
transparent mechanisms to redress grievances of affected persons and the procedure for&#13;
appeals; (c) the necessity to compensate for all affected assets, and housing in particular,&#13;
at full replacement values; (d) the inclusion of contingencies, especially for inflation, in&#13;
resettlement budgets; (e) the strengthening of institutional arrangements for both internal&#13;
and external monitoring of land acquisition and resettlement activities; and (f the planning&#13;
and execution of detailed processes of job creation. All of these issues, while complex,&#13;
have been satisfactorily addressed in all RAPs.&#13;
3.44         Legal Basis of Land Acquisition and Resettlement. By law, ownership&#13;
of all land in China is vested in either the state or the collectives. Collective land belongs&#13;
to farmers and is managed by village councils. Acquisition of land for development&#13;
projects is governed by national laws, provincial implementation regulations, and project-&#13;
specific regulations issued by provincial, municipal, or county governments. Since 1982,&#13;
authorities in China have substantially revised their laws and guidelines on resettlement in&#13;
different types of projects.&#13;
3.45         A specific model has been developed for resettlement arising from projects&#13;
in transport and industry. At the core of this model cf resettlement are the following&#13;
objectives: to avoid or minimize resettlement; to restore or improve the standards of&#13;
living of the adversely affected people; to consult affected localities during the project&#13;
design stage; to compensate villages for land acquired from them and to compensate&#13;
individuals for houses, standing crops, or other individually held assets; to provide land&#13;
to adversely affected persons through redistribution of land in villages or to provide jobs&#13;
in enterprises to members of villages where land per capita holdings fall below specified&#13;
minimum amounts; to restore disrupted infrastructure or compensate its owner(s); to&#13;
entrust implementation of land acquisition and resettlement to local governments. These&#13;
principles substantially meet the requirements of Bank policy on involuntary resettlement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
Based on national principles for transport projects, Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang&#13;
Province have issued specific regulations governing acquisition of land and resettlement&#13;
of people arising from the Expressway and the RSP.&#13;
3.46        HHEC, ZPEC, and ZPHAB (the project implementing agencies) are, on&#13;
behalf the Municipal and Provincial governments, responsible for ensuring that all affected&#13;
persons are resettled in accordance with the principle of restoring or improving income and&#13;
livelihoods in the shortest possible time. The project implementing agencies will ensure&#13;
that affected persons are given the maximum possible options as regards replacement sites&#13;
and employment, and will make special efforts to ensure the continuity of productive&#13;
employment for older, unskilled persons. The project implementing agencies will also&#13;
increase resettlement staff in order to allow adequate implementation and reporting from&#13;
local authorities.&#13;
3.47        Adverse Impacts of Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway. The total number&#13;
of people to be adversely affected by construction of the Expressway is 42,307, 82% of&#13;
whom will be affected only by the loss of land. About 90% of the adversely affected&#13;
reside in Zhejiang, with Shanghai residents accounting for the remaining 10%. Temporary&#13;
land acquisition will affect an additional 200 persons in Zhejiang and 420 persons in&#13;
Shanghai. Of the people adversely affected by loss of land, an estimated 8,239 persons&#13;
need to be economically rehabilitated through land readjustment and provision of jobs in&#13;
non-agricultural enterprises. Further details on the adverse impact of the project are&#13;
provided in Annex 4. Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) developed for each section of the&#13;
Expressway have been reviewed and found acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.48        Adverse Impacts of the Road Safety Program. Resettlement surveys&#13;
indicated that an estimated 13,964 individuals would be affected by civil works under the&#13;
RSP. The land acquisition, resettlement and compensation procedures to be followed are&#13;
consistent with those applied for the Zhejiang expressway section: a separate RAP&#13;
covering all packages under the RSP has been received and found acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.49        Monitoring and Evaluation of Resettlement. As in previous Bank-financed&#13;
highway projects in China, regular monitoring and reporting will be used to evaluate the&#13;
implementation of resettlement. The proposed project includes internal monitoring, and&#13;
reporting by project implementing agencies HHEC, ZPEC, and ZPHAB, and independent&#13;
(external) monitoring and reporting by specialized agencies in Shanghai and Zhejiang. The&#13;
agencies appointed for independent monitoring are the Shanghai Academy of Social&#13;
Sciences (for Shanghai) and the Urban and Rural Planning Institute of Hangzhou University&#13;
(for Zhejiang). These agencies were initially retained to help HHEC, ZPEC, and ZPHAB&#13;
conduct socio-economic surveys to estimate resettlement impact as the basis for RAPs.&#13;
The monitoring represents a continuation of the independent agencies' involvement in the&#13;
resettlement activities for this project.&#13;
3.50        The monitoring and reporting for all resettlement activities in Zhejiang&#13;
Province are underway; the first internal monitoring report dated June 15, 1995 has been&#13;
received, and the first independent monitoring report would be submitted to the Bank by&#13;
July 15, 1995. For resettlement activities in Shanghai, the first internal and independent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
monitoring reports would be submitted to the Bank by July 15, 1995 and September 1,&#13;
1995, respectively. After the initial reports, additional internal monitoring reports would&#13;
be prepared and submitted to the Bank every 3 months and independent monitoring reports&#13;
would be prepared and submitted to the Bank every 6 months, according to the schedule&#13;
described in Annex 6.&#13;
3.51        The monitoring is designed to examine and monitor progress in&#13;
implementation of the RAPs, paying particular attention to the timeliness and adequacy of&#13;
compensation payments, proper relocation of resettlers, delivery of specified entitlements&#13;
(including jobs and provisions for meeting the needs of vulnerable people) to eligible&#13;
resettlers, and the adequacy of measures to restore the standards of living of the affected&#13;
people. The independent monitoring institutions will conduct surveys to determine the&#13;
degree of success in meeting the objectives of the RAPs, and will report their findings in&#13;
writing to HHEC, ZPEC, and ZPHAB, recommending specific actions when warranted.&#13;
Agreements were reached from SM and ZP at negotiations that internal and independent&#13;
monitoring will be carried out against the agreed RAPs; that internal and independent&#13;
monitoring reports for resettlement will be submitted to the Bank at three- and six-month&#13;
intervals, respectively; and that, in the event changes in the RAPs are required based on&#13;
the recommendations of monitoring agencies or other evaluations, SM and ZP willfurnish&#13;
the proposed revision of the RAPs to the Bank for its prior approval.&#13;
3.52        As local governments are responsible for implementing resettlement plans&#13;
in China, the expressway commissions have signed agreements with the local governments&#13;
to acquire land and resettle the adversely affected people. The majority of those losing&#13;
land will be assigned new plots through redistribution of the remaining lands of the&#13;
affected villages. Compensation funds for land will be invested to increase the productivity&#13;
of the remaining lands or establish/strengthen village enterprises. Those losing houses will&#13;
be provided assigned plots in residential sites provided by their villages. Based on relevant&#13;
criteria, eligible persons will be employed in enterprises. Those being resettled are&#13;
afforded opportunities for productive employment through the assignment of new land or&#13;
the provision of non-agricultural employment in close proximity to their current land&#13;
holdings or places of residence.&#13;
3.53        Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs).  Summaries of the RAPs for the&#13;
Shanghai and Zhejiang segments of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway and for the Road&#13;
Safety Program are included in Annex 4. Complete copies of the RAPs are available in&#13;
the Project File. Agreements were reached from SM and ZP at negotiations that all land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement activities with respect to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway&#13;
and the Road Safety Program will be completed according to RAPs found satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
3.54        Inplementation of RAPs.4/ The expressway length in Zhejiang Province&#13;
consists of two sections. The first and smaller section, on the outskirts of Hangzhou City&#13;
between Pengbu and Wengmei, is the site of an advance contracting section. Land&#13;
4/    Detailed implementation schedules for all land acquisition and resettlement activities have been&#13;
provided in the respective RAPs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
acquisition and resettlement compensation plans for this section were implemented between&#13;
October 1993 and April 1994. The second and major section is situated between Wengmei&#13;
and Fengjing (on the border with Shanghai Municipality). Land acquisition for the&#13;
Wengmei-Fengjing section commenced in the fall of 1994 and has essentially been&#13;
completed, to allow construction to begin in mid-1995. The resettlement for both of these&#13;
sections was carried out according to an earlier version of the RAP for the Zhejiang&#13;
section. The principles and compensation strategies in the RAP to be confirmed at&#13;
negotiations will, as relevant, be applied retroactively to people already resettled. The&#13;
resettlement for the RSP has largely been completed, according to the principles and&#13;
compensation strategies in this RAP. Implementation of resettlement in Shanghai would&#13;
begin in late July 1995, to be consistent with the timing of construction.&#13;
3.55               Budgets of Y 173 million for the Shanghai expressway section, Y 294&#13;
million for the Zhejiang expressway section, and Y 32 million for the Road Safety&#13;
Program have been earmarked for implementation of the respective RAPs. The budgets&#13;
include provisions for annual inflation and for retroactive compensation for persons&#13;
affected prior to Bank acceptance of the final RAPs. Shanghai and Zhejiang have agreed&#13;
to make additional provisions for cost overruns during implementation of the RAPs.&#13;

3.57        The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $271.3 million, or 37 percent of&#13;
total cost. Base costs were estimated in November 1993 and adjusted for local currency&#13;
devaluation in mid-1994. Physical contingencies were calculated at 10 percent of the base&#13;
cost of works and supervision of highway construction. Price contingencies have been&#13;
calculated for both foreign and domestic costs, using the current Bank annual escalation&#13;
factors. Annual inflation rates assumed for foreign costs were 3.1%, 6.9%, 2.0%, 1.6%,&#13;
2.1%, 2.4%, 2.2%, and 2.5% for the years 1994 to 2001, respectively. Annual inflation&#13;
rates assumed for local costs were 25.0 %, 14.0%, 10.5%, 8.5%, 7.0%, and 6.5% for the&#13;
years 1994 to 1999, respectively, and 6.2% for the years 2000 and 2001. Identifiable&#13;
taxes and duties for works and equipment, included in the project cost analysis, were&#13;
estimated at Y 226 million (approximately $26 million).&#13;
3.58        The cost of civil works is based on the following:&#13;
(a)   Zhejiang Province:&#13;
(i)     the value of Contracts 1 through 4 approved by the Bank for the&#13;
Pengbu-Wengmei section (NCB procurement);&#13;
(ii)    final plan quantities and MOC standard unit costs for Contract 5&#13;
of the Pengbu-Wengmei section (NCB procurement); and&#13;
(iii)    the value of Contracts 6 through 10 approved by the Bank for&#13;
expressway construction (ICB procurement).&#13;
(b)   Shanghai Municipality - final plan quantities and MOC standard unit costs&#13;
for expressway construction under Contracts HHO1, HH02 and HH03 (ICB&#13;
procurement).&#13;
(c)   Road Safety Program - final plan quantities and standard Provincial unit&#13;
costs for the nine road sections (NCB procurement).&#13;
The cost per kilometer of the expressway component reflects in part the advance&#13;
preparation being done for later expansion to six lanes, including, in the Shanghai section,&#13;
subgrade works for six lanes. Further, both Shanghai and Zhejiang will build selected&#13;
structures to a six-lane standard and will complete all land acquisition and resettlement for&#13;
a six-lane ROW during the current project stage.&#13;
3.59        The cost of equipment was estimated based on prevailing prices and prices&#13;
quoted by manufacturers and suppliers. The estimated cost of consulting services is based&#13;
on recent contracts for similar services under ongoing highway projects. Additional&#13;
information on project cost and financing is provided in Annex 5.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

H. FINANCING&#13;
3.60         The proposed Bank loan of $260 million would represent 36 percent of the&#13;
total project cost and 96 percent of the foreign exchange cost. The Central Government&#13;
of China would provide $58.1 million equivalent in grant funding, SM would provide&#13;
$177.3 million equivalent, and ZP would provide $233.8 million equivalent to cover the&#13;
remaining costs of the project, including contingencies. Local financing of the project by&#13;
Shanghai and Zhejiang would comprise highway sector user charges and other funds raised&#13;
at the provincial level. Agreements were reached at negotiations that the Central&#13;
Government would make the proceeds of the loan available to SM and ZP on the same&#13;
terms as those of the Bank loan, with SM and ZP bearing the foreign exchange risk. The&#13;
details of project financing are shown below and in Annex 5.&#13;

3.61          Delays of more than one year have been sustained in all project components&#13;
during preparation; however, the sequencing of project activities as confirmed during&#13;
appraisal will be maintained during implementation (as shown in Annex 6). Retroactive&#13;
financing has been requested to allow necessary start-up activities to proceed, so that the&#13;
overall implementation plan can be kept intact and further delays can be avoided. The&#13;
need for retroactive financing is anticipated for the following project activities, which in&#13;
total require $26 million (10 percent of the $260 million loan). Retroactive financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
would apply to payments made after September 1, 1994 (based on a planned date for loan&#13;
signing of September 1, 1995).&#13;
(a)   Construction of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway (Shanghai and&#13;
Zhejiang). Retroactive financing is requested for start-up activities related&#13;
to construction of sections the main expressway alignment under 3 ICB&#13;
contracts in Shanghai and 5 ICB contracts in Zhejiang. The construction of&#13;
these sections is scheduled to begin in early September, 1995: mobilization&#13;
advances to contractors would be retroactively financed. The ICB contracts&#13;
in Shanghai also include a soft soil test section proposed for retroactive&#13;
financing, comprising testing of soil and of remedial measures, to address&#13;
the difficult geological conditions along the alignment. The soft soil works&#13;
are typically done before major construction so that test results and&#13;
observations of settlement along bridges and embankments may be taken&#13;
into consideration in the selection of soft soil remedies during construction&#13;
of the main expressway and structures. Advance work on soft soils would&#13;
also help make use of a scarce resource, excavated earth accumulated during&#13;
the ongoing Taipu River and Huangpu River Projects, reducing the need for&#13;
excavation of farmland for soil, and would be cost-saving. The total&#13;
estimated cost of these works is $2.8 million; the amount of retroactive&#13;
financing is $0.5 million. The total estimated cost of the ICB contracts in&#13;
Shanghai and Zhejiang is $483.4 million;  the amount of retroactive&#13;
financing is $16.1 million ($1.2 million in Shanghai and $14.9 million in&#13;
Zhejiang).&#13;
(b)   Supervision of Construction for the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway&#13;
(Shanghai and Zhejiang). The mobilization of a construction supervision&#13;
team and training that would be completed prior to construction are critical&#13;
start-up activities for the project, and would be retroactively financed. The&#13;
total cost of construction supervision services for the Expressway (including&#13;
training) is $16.6 million; the amount of retroactive financing is $1.0&#13;
million ($0.1 million in Shanghai and $0.9 million in Zhejiang).&#13;
(c)   Construction of the Pengbu-Wengmei Section (Zhejiang). Work on the&#13;
first 13 km section of the Expressway originating in Hangzhou began in&#13;
February 1994 in expectation of an FY95 Board date. Early construction&#13;
of these sections will relieve a potentially serious traffic bottleneck for the&#13;
three- to four-year period between the opening of the Hangzhou-Ningbo and&#13;
Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressways. The works will be completed by mid-&#13;
1996. The total estimated cost of the works is $30.7 million; the amount&#13;
of retroactive financing is $8.6 million.&#13;
All of the retroactive financing proposals are subject to satisfaction of the Bank's&#13;
requirements for environment, resettlement, and procurement. For retroactively-financed&#13;
civil works in this project, the Bank also specifically requires adherence to the overall&#13;
project implementation plan, monitoring reports that indicate satisfactory completion of&#13;
resettlement according to agreed RAPs, adequate construction supervision to ensure quality&#13;
of the works, and progress reporting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

I. PRoJEcr IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.62        Implementation of the project would be the primary responsibility of&#13;
expressway and highway agencies in Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province. Annex&#13;
6 provides an implementation schedule for all project components, timetable for civil&#13;
works, and further description of the organizational arrangements for project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
3.63        Arrangements for project implementation were developed at appraisal and&#13;
confirmed at negotiations. At negotiations, understandings were reached regarding the&#13;
role, organization and staffing of the Shanghai Municipality's Shanghai-Hangzhou&#13;
Expressway Engineering Construction Executive Commission, Zhejiang Provinces'&#13;
Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway Project Executive Commission, and the Zhejiang&#13;
Provincial Highway Administration Bureau (the implementing agencies for the Expressway&#13;
and the RSP). Agreements were reached during negotiations that the project implementing&#13;
agencies for the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway and Road Safety Program components&#13;
will at all times be staffed with qualified staff in adequate numbers.&#13;
3.64        The project has been delayed significantly during preparation due to changes&#13;
in design, cost, and resettlement components, affecting both government approvals and&#13;
ability to secure Bank financing. This has resulted in a delay of at least one year in the&#13;
onset of expressway construction. The phasing of works during project implementation&#13;
is subject to further change. Therefore, it was agreed at negotiations that Shanghai and&#13;
Zhejiang will submit to the Bank a detailed implementation plan, covering all aspects of&#13;
the project, including environment and resettlement, by September 30 of each year&#13;
beginning in 1996, for activities during the coming year, and will thereafter carry out such&#13;
work taking into account comments made by the Bank.&#13;
3.65        Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway. The Shanghai Shanghai-Hangzhou (Hu-&#13;
Hang) Expressway Construction Commission (HHEC) would be the implementing agency&#13;
for the Shanghai section of the Expressway, under the direction of the Leading Group for&#13;
Shanghai's Major Transport Projects.  The Zhejiang Provincial Expressway Project&#13;
Executive Commission (ZPEC) would be the implementing agency for the Zhejiang section&#13;
of the Expressway, under the direction of the Zhejiang Provincial Expressway Project&#13;
Steering Committee. Since the Expressway would be a segment of the national highway&#13;
network, MOC is also expected to provide general supervision and guidance for execution&#13;
of the project. During negotiations, understandings were reached concerning the authority,&#13;
role, organization, and staffing of all project implementing agencies. The implementing&#13;
agencies have been authorized to complete recruitment of staff for project management and&#13;
to enter into contracts for project implementation.&#13;
3.66        The organizational and staffing arrangements for construction supervision&#13;
of the Expressway were confirmed during project appraisal. Construction would be&#13;
supervised by joint supervision teams, one located in Shanghai and the other located in&#13;
Hangzhou, each headed by a Chief Supervision Engineer with a Resident Engineer located&#13;
on site for each of the construction contracts. About 160 personnel would be permanently&#13;
engaged in supervision. Invitations to shortlisted international consulting firms were issued&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
in February 1994. A qualified firm has been selected and the consultants are expected to&#13;
be mobilized during the third quarter of 1995 to begin training local personnel in&#13;
construction supervision and to help set up the organization for supervision.&#13;
3.67        The invitation to bid was issued to prequalified contractors in November and&#13;
July 1994 for Shanghai and Zhejiang, respectively. Construction of the main part of the&#13;
Expressway is scheduled to commence in September 1995 and be completed in early 2000,&#13;
or in about 54 months.&#13;
3.68        During negotiations, understandings were reached concerning the location,&#13;
timing, and responsibility for implementation of ancillary civil works in the Shanghai&#13;
expressway section that will be completed without Bank financing. The implementation&#13;
of these works is consistent with overall project implementation for the expressway, and&#13;
would be reviewed during project supervision.&#13;
3.69        The installation of electrical, electronic and mechanical systems for the&#13;
operation of the expressway is scheduled to commence in late 1998 and be completed by&#13;
mid-2000. The construction of service facilities and improvement of crossroads at the six&#13;
expressway interchanges in Zhejiang Province will begin in late 1995 and be completed&#13;
in early 2000, concurrently with the expressway works.&#13;
3.70        Road Safety Program. The Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration&#13;
Bureau (ZPHAB) would be the executing agency for the RSP. ZPHAB was the principal&#13;
agency involved in implementation of the Zhejiang provincial component of the Bank's&#13;
first highway project in China and the Road Improvement Program under the Zhejiang&#13;
Provincial Highway Project. A special unit has been set up in ZPHAB to manage the&#13;
program, coordinate its activities with all concerned agencies, ensure consistency in the&#13;
quality of design, supervise, expedite implementation and meet reporting requirements&#13;
(Annex 2). The needs of this unit for laboratory equipment have been included in the list&#13;
of equipment to be provided under the project. Also, needs for transport would be&#13;
provided under the civil works contracts for the implementation of the RSP. During&#13;
negotiations, an understanding was reached that the transport administrations at&#13;
prefectural/county levels are adequately staffed for implementation of the RSP and the&#13;
procurement or mobilization of equipment office facilities, transportation, staff training&#13;
arrangements, and other necessary resources for the preparation and execution of the RSP&#13;
subprojects is underway.&#13;
3.71        The formulation, preparation and execution of the RSP involves several&#13;
highway sector agencies in Zhejiang Province. Zhejiang Provincial Transport Design&#13;
Institute in cooperation with the relevant design institutes of municipalities and prefectures&#13;
would be responsible for preparing preliminary and final engineering designs as well as&#13;
bidding documents for the subprojects under the RSP. The design and bidding documents&#13;
would be reviewed and approved by ZPHAB. Construction of the first section of the&#13;
program is scheduled to commence in late 1995 and be completed in about 24 months.&#13;
The design and road safety impact of individual RSP sections would be addressed in detail&#13;
in section information packages submitted to the Bank for review. The program as a&#13;
whole is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
3.72        Equipment. The responsibility for procurement of equipment would be&#13;
divided between HHEC, the Shanghai Highway Management Department, ZPEC and&#13;
ZPHAB. HHEC and ZPEC would be responsible for the procurement of equipment&#13;
related to the Expressway component, such as equipment for the central laboratory,&#13;
environmental protection, soft-soil treatment research, and operation and maintenance of&#13;
the highway. Equipment for the central laboratory and environmental protection would be&#13;
procured during 1996/97, equipment for operation and maintenance of the highway is&#13;
scheduled to be procured during 1997/99. A portion of the Shanghai equipment list is&#13;
being procured in advance by the Shanghai Highway Management Department, and would&#13;
be available to highway agencies in Shanghai by the end of 1995.&#13;
3.73        Responsibility for the procurement of equipment related to the RSP&#13;
component of the project would rest with ZPHAB. Equipment for the RSP is scheduled&#13;
to be procured during 1996/97, so that equipment may be available during the&#13;
implementation of the RSP technical assistance.&#13;
3.74        The project as a whole is scheduled to be completed by December 31, 2000&#13;
with the loan closing date stipulated as June 30, 2001.&#13;
J. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.75        The procurement of all Bank-financed activities under the project will be in&#13;
accordance with "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated&#13;
January 1995 and as shown in the following table. Procurement arrangements for the&#13;
project have taken into account the experience gained from previous Bank-financed&#13;
highway projects. The documentation for procurement, which covers the prequalification&#13;
of contractors under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive&#13;
Bidding (NCB) for civil works and goods, has been standardized for Chinese conditions&#13;
in cooperation between the Chinese Government and the Bank. The revised set of model&#13;
documents would be used for all relevant procurement processes under the project. In&#13;
particular, prequalification criteria for civil works under ICB procedures have been&#13;
tightened and are now based on performance requirements pertinent to each of the&#13;
contracts.&#13;
3.76        Civil Works.  A large proportion of contracts for civil works for the&#13;
expressway (83 percent of contract value) would be procured under ICB. ICB procurement&#13;
for works will be used for contracts of $10 million and above. There are eight ICB&#13;
contracts for civil works for the Expressway, five in Zhejiang and three in Shanghai, with&#13;
an estimated cost of $483.4 million. Contracts average about 15 km in length with costs&#13;
in the range of about $49-70 million each. Contractors, according to their bidding capacity&#13;
(determined during the evaluation of the prequalification submissions), would be permitted&#13;
to submit bids for one or more contracts. Qualified domestic contractors would receive&#13;
a 7.5 percent preference in bid evaluation on these contracts.&#13;
3.77        An additional five civil works contracts, for construction of the first 13 km&#13;
section of the Expressway adjoining Hangzhou and including the Wengmei interchange and&#13;
a 6-km Class 2 link road connecting to NR 320 at Lingpin, are to be procured under NCB&#13;

procedures acceptable to the Bank. The cost of these contracts is estimated at $39.6&#13;
million. Advance contracting and NCB have been used for the first four contracts,&#13;
covering 13 km of the expressway: construction began in February 1994 with completion&#13;
expected by mid-1996. The fifth contract, for construction of a 6-km access road to NR&#13;
320, will be awarded under NCB procedures in 1996 with completion scheduled by the end&#13;
of 1998. NCB procedures were used because (a) the expressway passes through the urban&#13;
fringe of Hangzhou with several administrative subdivisions and attendant utility relocation&#13;
works, all of which made it doubtful whether major out-of-province or foreign contractors&#13;
would join the bidding; however, contractors were permitted to bid for more than one&#13;
contract; and (b) contracts under NCB procedures could be processed more quickly,&#13;
potentially providing earlier relief to the congested Hangzhou road network.&#13;
3.78        Remaining civil works contracts financed by the Bank in Zhejiang Province&#13;
include (a) eight contracts for the upgrading of 56 km of cross roads at six Expressway&#13;
interchanges with an estimated cost of $17.4 million, (b) six contracts for minor&#13;
construction works along the expressway with an estimated cost of $13.7 million,&#13;
comprising buildings for toll stations, maintenance depots, service areas and administrative&#13;
buildings, and (c) civil works for the RSP, with an estimated cost of $25.9 million.&#13;
Contracts for these three categories will likely be relatively small in value and are not&#13;
considered to be attractive to foreign firms; therefore, ICB would be neither justified nor&#13;
practical and the contracts would be awarded under NCB procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Qualifying foreign firms would not be precluded from bidding for the contracts.&#13;
3.79        The project also includes ancillary civil works for the expressway section&#13;
in Shanghai Municipality that would not be financed by the Bank. The ancillary civil&#13;
works have an estimated cost of $25.4 million and comprise pumps, small bridges, toll&#13;
stations, and related minor works. These works are small-scale and scattered, and would&#13;
be procured under local procedures (para 3.21).&#13;
3.80        Supply and Installation of Electrical and Mechanical Equipment.&#13;
Electrical and mechanical works for the Expressway will be procured under 3 contracts.&#13;
The Bank will finance two of these contracts, to be procured under ICB with a total cost&#13;
of $24.0 million, for the supply and installation of equipment in each of the Shanghai and&#13;
Zhejiang expressway sections. A third contract for the provision of power in the Shanghai&#13;
section will be procured by direct contract with Shanghai power authorities because the&#13;
supply of power in Shanghai is provided by a monopoly, and will not be financed by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
3.81        Equipment.  All contracts for goods and equipment estimated to cost&#13;
$200,000 or more would be procured following ICB procedures. Qualifying domestic&#13;
contractors and manufacturers competing under ICB would be eligible for a margin of&#13;
preference in the comparison of bids of 15 percent, or the prevailing custom duties,&#13;
whichever is lower. Contracts with estimated cost over $50,000 and up to $200,000 and&#13;
in aggregate amounts not exceeding $0.4 million for Shanghai and $1.4 million for&#13;
Zhejiang would be procured following NCB procedures. All other items or groups of&#13;
items covering minor maintenance, laboratory, research, and environmental equipment&#13;
associated with the two expressway sections and the RSP, of up to $50,000 per contract&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
and in aggregate amounts not exceeding $0.3 million for Shanghai and $0.6 million for&#13;
Zhejiang would be procured following international or national shopping procedures.&#13;
International and national shopping procedures would be based on a comparison of price&#13;
quotations solicited from at least three suppliers in accordance with "Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995.&#13;
3.82        Consulting Services. The need for consulting expertise was identified for&#13;
the supervision of construction, staff training, and for technical assistance to support the&#13;
RSP component. Local expertise available in the various provincial universities and&#13;
institutes in the subsector would be used as much as possible. All consultants would be&#13;
employed under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank in accordance with&#13;
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank&#13;
as Executing Agency."&#13;
3.83        Bank Review. During project supervision, contracts for expressway works&#13;
above a threshold of $4 million and all works contracts under the RSP would be subject&#13;
to the Bank's prior review procedures. The review process would cover about 94 percent&#13;
of the total works contract value (100 percent, ICB; 64 percent, NCB). Goods contracts&#13;
above $200,000 would also be subject to prior review, covering 83 percent of the total&#13;
value of Bank-financed goods. All contracts for electrical and mechanical works would&#13;
be subject to prior review. Consulting services contracts with value over $100,000 for&#13;
firms and over $50,000 for individuals would also be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
All other contracts would be subject to ex post facto review.&#13;
K. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.84        The proposed IBRD loan of $260 million would be disbursed over a period&#13;
of about six years, as follows:&#13;
(a) Civil Works&#13;
Construction&#13;
Shanghai Expressway Section     $40.4 million    35 percent&#13;
Zhejiang Expressway Section    $132.3 million    43 percent&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
(c) Consultant services and training&#13;
Shanghai Expressway Section       $5.8 million    100 percent&#13;
Zhejiang Expressway Section      $10.4 million    100 percent&#13;
Road Safety Program               $0.8 million    100 percent&#13;
(d) Unallocated                       $39.1 million&#13;
Total              $260.0 million&#13;
3.85        To facilitate disbursement, Special Accounts would be opened separately for&#13;
Shanghai and Zhejiang with initial deposits of $4.0 million for Shanghai and $12.5 million&#13;
for Zhejiang, the estimated average expenditures for a four-month period. The account&#13;
would be opened in US dollars in a bank acceptable to the Bank, and would be managed&#13;
by SM and ZP. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted&#13;
monthly or whenever the Special Account is drawn down to 50 percent of its initial&#13;
deposit, whichever comes first. A schedule of estimated disbursements is provided in&#13;
Table 3.8. This schedule takes into consideration the disbursement profile for transport&#13;
projects in China and the potential risk of delays in project implementation due to the&#13;
difficult subsoil conditions.&#13;
3.86        Disbursements would be made against priced contracts for the civil works&#13;
and delivery and installation of the equipment. Interim certification of civil works&#13;
completed and costed at unit rates in the contracts would be done by the joint supervision&#13;
teams, and payments would be authorized by SMEAB, ZPEC and ZPHAB. Retroactive&#13;
financing of $22.1 million would be applied to expenditures for civil works, consulting&#13;
services, and equipment contracts for the Expressway and the RSP. Disbursements for&#13;
staff training in China or abroad would be made against the actual costs of travel,&#13;
subsistence, and tuition or training fees. Reimbursement for individual expenditures under&#13;
contracts of $4 million or less for expressway works, $200,000 or less for goods and&#13;
electrical and mechanical works, $100,000 or less for consulting services contracts with&#13;
firms, and $50,000 or less for consulting services contracts with individuals and for&#13;
training may be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation&#13;
supporting SOEs would be retained by the implementing agencies and made available for&#13;
review by Bank supervision missions.&#13;
L. PROJECT MONITORING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
3.87        Monitoring. During implementation, project performance, including the&#13;
achievement of physical targets and attainment of other project objectives will be monitored&#13;
by the HHEC, ZPEC, and ZPHAB through the use of performance indicators (described&#13;
in Annex 6x, progress reports and auditing of project accounts. In addition, upon&#13;
completion, the project will be reviewed in an Implementation Completion Report.&#13;
3.88        The Foreign Investment Audit Bureau of the State Audit Administration&#13;
(SAA) would be responsible for auditing the accounts of project expenditures. Actual&#13;
audits in Shanghai would be carried out for SAA by the Shanghai Municipal Audit Bureau,&#13;
a subordinate organization of SAA. Audits in Zhejiang would be carried out either by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
Zhejiang Branch of SAA or the Zhejiang Provincial Audit Administration. Agreements&#13;
were reached with the Borrower, SM and ZP at negotiations that the project accounts, the&#13;
Special Accounts, and SOEs will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable&#13;
to the Bank. Audit reports will be sent to the Bank for review within six months of the&#13;
close of each fiscal year. In the case of SOEs, the audit report will contain a separate&#13;
opinion by the auditors as to whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together&#13;
with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon&#13;
to support the related withdrawals.&#13;
3.89        Based on the monitoring activities carried out by HHEC, ZPEC, and&#13;
ZPHAB, the following reports will be submitted to the Bank:&#13;
(a)   A series of internal and external (independent) monitoring reports (as&#13;
described in Annex 6) assessing the impact of land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement on various segments of the local population, describing the&#13;
income restoration strategies followed, and indicating the number of people&#13;
rehabilitated;&#13;
(b)   Annual audit reports for the project accounts and agencies' financial&#13;
statements (para 3.88);&#13;
(c)   Quarterly progress reports for all project activities (civil works, construction&#13;
supervision, technical assistance, training, procurement of goods and&#13;
services and environment), including up-to-date performance indicators;&#13;
(d)   Quarterly monitoring reports for the Road Safety Program (para 3.31); and&#13;
(e)   A Project Implementation Completion Report would be prepared and&#13;
submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the loan closing date.&#13;
During negotiations, it was agreed that Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province will&#13;
each furnish quarterly progress reports to the Bank and, upon completion of the project,&#13;
will each prepare an Implementation Completion Report no later than six months after the&#13;
loan closing date.&#13;
3.90        Supervision. The project would be supervised regularly by Bank missions.&#13;
A supervision mission plan, indicating key activities, is provided in Annex 7. In addition&#13;
to field missions, staff input would be provided at headquarters for project-related activities&#13;
such as completion of supervision reports, review of documentation submitted for the&#13;
clearance of RSP subproject packages, review of procurement documentation and contracts,&#13;
and staff training proposals. The Bank's supervision input is estimated at 85 staff-weeks,&#13;
38 in the field and 47 at headquarters.&#13;

4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
4.1          The economic analysis for the proposed project focuses on the civil works&#13;
components that, together with associated construction supervision and design, survey, and&#13;
testing, account for over 97 percent of the project base cost. The main infrastructure&#13;
investments in the project comprise:&#13;
(a)   construction of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expresswayl/; and&#13;
(b)   improvements to existing roads under the Road Safety Program.&#13;
A. MAN BENEFTS AND BENEFIcmAlUEs&#13;
4.2          The major quantifiable benefits of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Fxpressway&#13;
(hereafter, "the Expressway") and associated access roads would include: (a) reduced&#13;
traffic congestion for traffic remaining on the existing Shanghai-Hangzhou highway; and&#13;
(b) improved driving conditions, reduced traffic interference, and reduced travel distances&#13;
and times for traffic on the new expressway due to restricted access and the direct and&#13;
relatively uncongested nature of the new alignment.&#13;
4.3          The principal direct benefit of the Road Safety Program (RSP) is expected&#13;
to be a significant reduction in traffic accidents along the improved section of NR 320 due&#13;
to (a) the separation of slow-moving bicycles and agricultural vehicles from faster vehicular&#13;
traffic through provision of separate lanes for the slow traffic, and (b) by improved&#13;
intersection layouts. Longer-term (but unquantified) benefits from the program would&#13;
include (a) generally improved design of highway carriageways and intersections in the&#13;
region based on training received and experience gained in this project, and (b) reduced&#13;
accidents by remedial work at blackspots identified using equipment and training provided&#13;
under the project.&#13;
4.4          Benefits from the project would accrue to road users in the form of cost,&#13;
time, and accident savings, and to the Provincial Government in the form of reduced&#13;
highway maintenance costs and reduced burden on emergency services. Many road users&#13;
I/    The expressway segment proposed for financing under this project comprises the major portion of&#13;
the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway. A 20-km segment of this expressway, adjoining downtown&#13;
Shanghai, was completed in 1990 without Bank assistance. The remaining 130 km comprise the&#13;
proposed Bank project.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
are own-account operators for productive enterprises or, in the rural areas, individual&#13;
farmers, and thus should capture the benefits of the project directly. The public freight&#13;
and passenger services are also likely to respond to increased competition so that transport&#13;
costs savings would be passed on to the users; at minimum, reduced operating costs would&#13;
permit future price increases to be held down. Passengers would in any case enjoy the&#13;
time savings offered by the project.&#13;
4.5         The project also affords important, but non-quantifiable, institutional&#13;
benefits.  The project implementing agencies would directly benefit from project&#13;
development, management, and expressway operations experience which would be relevant&#13;
to their future activities in the sector. Staff in the implementing agencies would benefit&#13;
from training and practical experience in contracting and procurement. The highway&#13;
sector agencies in Shanghai and Zhejiang would strengthen their capacity to develop,&#13;
maintain and operate highways through the expansion of equipment fleets made possible&#13;
by equipment procurement in this project. Zhejiang highway authorities at provincial and&#13;
local levels would benefit from specialized training, practical experience, and enhanced&#13;
institutional capacity for road safety.&#13;
B. EVALUATION OF THE SHANGHAI-HANGZHOU ExPRESSWAY&#13;
4.6         The Existing Corridor. The Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor is a rapidly&#13;
developing part of the East Coast with activity ranging from traditional intensive&#13;
agriculture to light manufacturing. Shanghai is the largest city in China, and strong&#13;
economic growth is generating increasing demands for goods and raw materials from the&#13;
surrounding region. Transport demands for both freight and passengers are consequently&#13;
growing rapidly.&#13;
4.7         The main road in the corridor is NR 320; the section of NR 320 from&#13;
Hangzhou to Yuhang passes through urban Hangzhou, which is now becoming very&#13;
congested, and then around the only hills in the region; while the hills have no serious&#13;
adverse affects on grades and curvature, they do force the alignment to the north, which&#13;
adds considerable distance to the route to Shanghai. The alignment of NR 320 in Shanghai&#13;
is also not very direct, although for historical rather than topographical reasons. Further,&#13;
since a section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway is already opened to traffic in&#13;
Shanghai (the Xinzhuang-Songjiang section, which opened in 1990), high speed traffic&#13;
from the Songjiang terminus on the expressway to Fengjing now has to traverse some&#13;
inadequate minor roads to rejoin NR 320. Due to this inadequate access to Songjiang,&#13;
traffic between Shanghai and Fengjing moves along several parallel routes, including (a)&#13;
the Expressway-link road to NR 320, (b) entirely on NR 320 from Xinzhuang, (c) the&#13;
Songjiang-Zhengdian Highway and (d) the Maogang-Xinbang Highway. Most of these&#13;
routes have sections of low standard, and, apart from the Xinzhuang-Songjiang section of&#13;
the Expressway, none of the roads exceeds two-lane standard.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
4.8         In contrast to the sections near Hangzhou and Shanghai, the central section&#13;
of NR 320 from Fengjing to Yuhang is well-aligned and of good geometric standard. This&#13;
section of the route was upgraded to "Super Class II" standard in 1988, and comprises a&#13;
12 m carriageway with two 1 m shoulders. While not a full four lanes, motor traffic tends&#13;
to use the central portion of the carriageway and slower traffic keeps to the right. Being&#13;
a densely populated area, villages and towns are quite frequent, but generally frontage&#13;
development is relatively restrained. There are some 180 side road intersections along the&#13;
central section of NR 320, with associated interference to traffic.&#13;
4.9          The Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor is also served throughout its length by&#13;
Zhejiang Provincial Highway 01, with continuing extensions into Shanghai; this road for&#13;
the most part follows the coastline of the Qiantang River and estuary. The total length&#13;
from Pengbu to Songjiang is about 176 km, a little longer than via NR 320. Design&#13;
standards vary considerably between Zhejiang and Shanghai. In Zhejlang, which contains&#13;
two thirds of the route, the highway is of mostly low standard, between 6-7 m wide and&#13;
with an inferior alignment. In Shanghai, the route has been upgraded to four-lane standard&#13;
to exceed the quality of NR 320. In whole, the route does not carry much of the current&#13;
Shanghai-Hangzhou traffic (total volumes are about one third those of NR 320) and mostly&#13;
serves local needs.&#13;
4.10         The Proposed Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway. The Expressway would&#13;
be constructed to four-lane standard with access restricted to normal motor traffic;&#13;
agricultural tractors and nonmotorized traffic would be excluded. Provision is being made&#13;
to expand the Expressway to six-lane standard at a later date. Three alternative route&#13;
alignments were evaluated in the early stages of the project. The selected, central&#13;
alignment is the shortest, linking with the completed first section of the Shanghai-&#13;
Hangzhou Expressway at Songjiang in Shanghai to the Pengbu terminus of the Hangzhou-&#13;
Ningbo Expressway in Hangzhou.2/&#13;
4.11         The proposed expressway is approximately 130 km long, with 27.5 km in&#13;
Shanghai (Songjiang-Fengjing) and 102.5 km  in Zhejiang (Fengjing-Pengbu).  For&#13;
purposes of economic evaluation, sections of the existing NR 320 from Hangzhou to&#13;
Yuhang, Yuhang to Fengjing, and Fengjing to Songyin were considered, plus an additional&#13;
section of the Son-Jin (Songjiang to Jinshanwei) highway. This 165-km route represents&#13;
the best available alternative route to the proposed expressway. The distance saving by&#13;
using the expressway instead of this alternative route would be 35 km, with most of the&#13;
saving concentrated at the two ends as indicated below:&#13;
2/    The Pengbu interchange, part of the Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway being constructed under the Zhejiang&#13;
Provincial Highway Project, was completed in 1995. The entire Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway is&#13;
expected to open to traffic by 1997.&#13;

4.12        Trafric Volumes and Speeds on the Existing Roads. Records from the&#13;
Zhejiang and Shanghai traffic counting program indicate extremely rapid growth in traffic&#13;
in the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor (Tables 4.1 and 4.2). Total motor vehicle traffic grew&#13;
at 15 to 20 percent per year during 1986-92, with growth of small vehicle traffic averaging&#13;
18 to 27 percent. Growth has accelerated during the 1990s to about 21 to 26 percent per&#13;
year, with growth of small vehicle traffic reaching 30 to 37 percent. Traffic distribution&#13;
patterns are illustrated below (paras 4.13 and 4.14), based on counts at the 24-hour count&#13;
station at Nanhu on NR 320 near Jiaxing, located about halfway between Shanghai and&#13;
Hangzhou. Bank mission observations confirm the counts as representative of actual traffic&#13;
flows.&#13;
4.13        Detailed traffic count records from Nanhu, show that daytime traffic flows&#13;
are fairly evenly distributed, with the highest hour taking just over 7 percent of the daily&#13;
traffic. A relatively high proportion of traffic moves at night, with 15 percent of all&#13;
movements occurring in the eight hours between 10 pm and 6 am and a further 16 percent&#13;
in the four hours between 6 pm and 10 pm, in both cases about half as high again as the&#13;
normal proportion. All these factors indicate constant traffic pressure on the existing&#13;
highway, with some drivers preferring to travel by night to avoid daytime congestion in&#13;
the corridor.&#13;
4.14        Traffic speeds on the central section of NR 320 currently average about 30&#13;
to 35 kilometers per hour (km/h) during the day, much lower than the average speed of&#13;
45 to 55 km/h observed by Bank missions during 1993. High traffic volumes, combined&#13;
with the fast developing congestion, as evidenced by the considerable drop in average&#13;
speeds within a matter of a year, make the road vulnerable to major disruption by traffic&#13;
accidents or road works. Speeds are even lower on the sections near Hangzhou and in&#13;
Shanghai (apart from the sections of expressway already opened) where road geometry is&#13;
less satisfactory and local traffic volumes are higher. It currently takes about 5 to 6 hours&#13;
to drive from the center of Shanghai to the center of Hangzhou, a distance of about&#13;
200 km.&#13;
4.15        Projected Traffic on the Expressway. Projections of expressway traffic&#13;
require estimates of traffic growth and traffic diversion.&#13;
4.16        Regarding traffic growth, prevailing high growth rates and continuing strong&#13;
economic expansion make the task of traffic projections extraordinarily difficult. Clearly,&#13;
the current very high traffic growth cannot continue indefinitely, but there are few clues&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
as to when it might end. Because current growth rates are high, an error of only a few&#13;
years in judging the duration of the high growth period may have a profound impact on&#13;
the overall level of projected traffic. This is critically important since the justification and&#13;
timing of the expressway hinges on the rate at which traffic congestion develops along NR&#13;
320.&#13;
4.17         Some considerations on selecting traffic growth rates are set out below:&#13;
(a)    Highway traffic growth rates tend to run higher than economic growth rates.&#13;
Current economic growth is in the range of 10 to 15 percent per year, and&#13;
long-term sustainable growth is perhaps around 10 percent per year. This&#13;
indicates a traffic growth in the region of 10 to 15 percent per year, and&#13;
closer to 20 percent per year at present. I&#13;
(b)   The expressway would dramatically reduce travel times between Shanghai&#13;
and Zhejiang, cutting some 1 to 2 hours off trip duration and producing&#13;
much greater savings compared with the future, more congested travel on&#13;
existing roads; this would likely lead to strong traffic generation effects.&#13;
4.18         Based on these considerations, two corridor forecasts were adopted:  a&#13;
standard forecast to reflect a likely outcome, and a low forecast for use in sensitivity tests.&#13;
Traffic growth rates were projected by class of vehicle, with small vehicle traffic showing&#13;
the fastest growth; average growth rates were applied, as follows3/:&#13;
STANDARD             LOW&#13;
1993-1995          21% per year         17% per year&#13;
1995-2000           14%                 10%&#13;
After 2000          10%                 7%&#13;
4.19         Regarding traffic diversion to the new expressway, two critical factors were&#13;
considered: (a) the proportion of long-distance traffic, which would be more inclined to&#13;
transfer to the expressway, and (b) the comparative ease of travel between the existing road&#13;
and the expressway. The proportion of long-distance traffic is not easy to determine. An&#13;
origin-destination study conducted as part of the feasibility study concluded that most&#13;
traffic in the corridor travels over long distances, but this cannot be completely correct:&#13;
traffic volumes on NR 320 in Zhejiang vary by section between about 8,000 per day and&#13;
12,500 per day, indicating significant local traffic components. Regarding comparative&#13;
ease of travel, the expressway has clear advantages over NR 320 for only very long-&#13;
distance traffic, and for short-distance traffic in the sections near Shanghai and Hangzhou.&#13;
Until serious congestion develops, the two routes are fairly similar along the main central&#13;
section of the corridor.&#13;
3/    The traffic growth rates assumed for analysis are significantly lower than actual recorded rates in the past&#13;
several years. See also para 4.48.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
4.20        The feasibility study assumed unrealistically high diversion rates averaging&#13;
80 to 90 percent and reaching 98 percent on some sections (i.e., leaving almost no traffic&#13;
on the existing road), with lower rates of 60 to 85 percent when tolling of the new&#13;
expressway was assumed. For the analysis in this report, two diversion rates were&#13;
adopted: a standard rate of 67 percent for all medium- and long-distance traffic, and a low&#13;
rate of 33 percent for sensitivity tests. With tolling, these diversion rates would be&#13;
decreased (para 4.33).&#13;
4.21         On this basis, traffic projections were prepared both for traffic remaining&#13;
on the existing highway and for traffic diverted to the new expressway (Table 4.3).&#13;
Additional generated traffic was added to the new highway at the rate of 5 percent of the&#13;
diverted traffic. Traffic projections on the existing highway in the case without the project&#13;
assumed that growth would be restricted by the capacity limits of the existing road; this&#13;
suppressed demand would be released with the opening of the new highway and was&#13;
treated as additional generated traffic.&#13;
4.22         Economic Analysis.  The economic benefits of the Expressway derive&#13;
principally from the savings in travel time and cost for existing and projected traffic, and&#13;
from the additional economic development brought about by the improved road facility.&#13;
All these benefits are conventionally estimated by analyzing changes in vehicle operating&#13;
speeds and costs brought about by the new road. Discounted cost-benefit tables were&#13;
prepared under alternative assumptions; in each case, the Economic Internal Rate of Return&#13;
(EIRR) and First-Year Rate of Return (FYRR) in the year of opening were compared with&#13;
the test discount rate of 12 percent used for China projects to assess feasibility. The&#13;
evaluation considered traffic congestion, project benefits, construction costs, tolling, the&#13;
impact of the Road Safety Program (RSP), and sensitivity analyses.&#13;
4.23         Traffic Congestion. For sections of the route near Hangzhou and Shanghai,&#13;
the economic benefits are dominated by the large distance savings provided by a new&#13;
expressway, ensuring the early feasibility of these sections of the Expressway under any&#13;
reasonable assumptions of traffic growth and traffic diversion rates.&#13;
4.24         The situation is less clear for the main central section of the corridor&#13;
between Yuhang and Fengjing. Modest distance savings of about 9 percent would be&#13;
captured by long-distance through-traffic, with far smaller or even negative impacts for&#13;
short- and medium-distance traffic (which requires use of the access roads to join and leave&#13;
the expressway). Geometric alignment and surface conditions on the expressway would&#13;
not be much better than NR 320, which is in good condition and was recently upgraded.&#13;
Moreover, the Road Safety Program component of the project proposes to provide separate&#13;
facilities for bicycle and agricultural traffic along this section of NR 320, significantly&#13;
improving existing travel conditions. Hence, the main benefit from the Expressway in the&#13;
central part of the corridor would come from providing relatively congestion-free&#13;
conditions with consequent shorter travel times and lower vehicle operating costs. For&#13;
these reasons, an analysis of likely congestion levels on the existing NR 320 was crucial&#13;
to the economic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
4.25        The results of the congestion analysis are summarized in Table 4.4, which&#13;
shows projected travel times and speeds in the project corridor (excluding road sections in&#13;
Shanghai beyond the project limits) under alternative assumptions. In the absence of the&#13;
Expressway and the RSP improvements, travel speeds have already declined from an&#13;
average of about 50 km/h in 1993 to around 35 km/h in February 1995 (much lower than&#13;
the speed of 47 km/h projected in an exercise done in 1993), and are expected to drop&#13;
precipitously to less than 13 km/h by 2005, suggesting a fourfold increase in travel times&#13;
over 1993 conditions. By then, existing highway capacity limits would have been reached,&#13;
effectively cutting off further growth in traffic. In practice, some of the traffic would&#13;
move to other roads, including Provincial Highway 01, and traffic would continue to&#13;
spread into the non-peak hours, including more nighttime travel. Both these actions would&#13;
impose additional unquantified costs that would tend to increase the benefits of the&#13;
expressway.&#13;
4.26        Speeds would be improved somewhat by the RSP, reducing congested travel&#13;
time in the corridor from 7 to 6 hours by the year 2001. While not a very large impact,&#13;
by reducing congestion levels, the RSP does reduce the economic benefits associated with&#13;
the expressway (para 4.34).&#13;
4.27        Traffic speeds on the new expressway would remain substantially above&#13;
speeds on the existing road, starting at around 70 km/h at opening, but also declining with&#13;
increasing traffic volume to 63 km/h by 2010. After this, speeds could be expected to&#13;
drop sharply. This strongly suggests that the policy of making provision for future&#13;
expansion to six-lane standard in the initial stages of construction is well-advised.&#13;
However, the case for later expansion has not been evaluated here. The timing of any&#13;
later expansion would ultimately depend on traffic growth rates actually achieved on the&#13;
4-lane expressway.&#13;
4.28        Project Benerits. Project benefits were estimated based mainly on savings&#13;
in vehicle operating costs and savings in travel time; average operating costs by vehicle&#13;
class for the existing road and the new expressway are shown in Table 4.5. These&#13;
estimates of vehicle operating costs were increased for congested highways to reflect the&#13;
lower traffic speeds and greater frequency of speed-change cycles characteristic of these&#13;
operating conditions. The evaluation also assumed that the very high proportion of night&#13;
time traffic would be reduced (since long-distance traffic would no longer have to travel&#13;
at that time to avoid congestion), returning the corridor to a more normal traffic&#13;
distribution.&#13;
4.29        Construction Costs. Financial costs for construction of the Expressway&#13;
were estimated at Y 5,757 million, including allowances for physical and price&#13;
contingencies, and resettlement (Table 4.6). Economic costs of Y 4,171 million were&#13;
estimated from the financial costs by deducting taxes and price contingencies and then,&#13;
based on recent analyses by the World Bank, increased by 5 percent to reflect the shadow&#13;
prices of project components for highway projects.&#13;
4.30        For evaluation purposes, the main part of the Expressway is assumed to take&#13;
about fifty months to construct, opening in the year 2000. An advance contracting section&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
from Hangzhou to Yuhang is assumed to open by the year 1998 4/. Additional costs are&#13;
anticipated in years five and fifteen for remedial pavement works (much of the expressway&#13;
would be built in soft-soil areas) and for major periodic maintenance. Annual costs of&#13;
highway maintenance and toll operations have also been included.&#13;
4.31         Evaluation without Tolls. The three sections of the Expressway were first&#13;
evaluated without tolling. For this case, construction costs were reduced by Y 180 million&#13;
to eliminate toll facility costs, and the recurrent costs of toll collection operations were&#13;
omitted. The resulting EIRR of the complete Expressway is 35 percent, with an FYRR&#13;
in 2001 of 25 percent (Table 4.7).&#13;
4.32         Evaluation with Tolls. It is intended that the highway be operated as a toll&#13;
road, which would involve higher costs of construction and operation, due to the toll&#13;
facilities, and a loss of potential benefits. The performance of major toll road projects in&#13;
China has not been consistent to date. In the north of China, traffic levels have been lower&#13;
than expected, generating disappointing toll revenues. In the south, the experience on&#13;
certain expressways in Guangdong Province has been more encouraging, with high traffic&#13;
growth rates on recently opened expressways and better potential for cost recovery. Given&#13;
the high economic growth in the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor, and the likely growth in&#13;
congestion on the existing road network, it is expected that tolling on the proposed&#13;
Expressway would generate significant revenues. Tolling would impact the project&#13;
benefits, but its effect cannot be determined with reasonable confidence until toll levels are&#13;
determined 5/ (para 3.22).&#13;
4.33         Imposition of tolls would have the effect of reducing traffic volumes along&#13;
the Expressway, but each component of traffic would be affected differently. Long-&#13;
distance traffic using the new highway would be the least likely to be affected, since the&#13;
savings afforded by the new highway compared with the existing road are considerable and&#13;
would not easily be offset by tolls. For medium- and short-distance traffic, the choice of&#13;
route, old or new, depends on the balance between shorter, but congested, travel on the&#13;
existing road versus longer distances (including travel on access roads) but less congested&#13;
travel via the new highway. The addition of tolls to the new highway would reset the&#13;
balance point in choosing between the old and the new route, and could be expected to&#13;
deter significant short-distance traffic from using the new highway. Since the benefits of&#13;
the new highway accrue mostly to longer-distance traffic, it can be expected that the drop&#13;
in traffic on the new highway due to the imposition of tolls is likely to be greater than the&#13;
drop in benefits. The toll road evaluation assumes that traffic volumes under tolled&#13;
conditions (for example, if tolls were set at no more than 30 percent of attributable cost&#13;
savings) would be lowered by about 17 percent, but that benefits would be lowered by only&#13;
14 percent. Evaluation as a toll road indicates a reduction in economic return, with an&#13;
EIRR of 32.8 percent and an FYRR of 21 percent for the entire expressway (Table 4.8).&#13;
4/    This comprises the Pengbu-Wengmei section, already under construction, and additional works in&#13;
Yuhang, to begin in early 1996. About 4 km of the section would open with the main expressway; the&#13;
evaluation assumed an earlier incidence of costs for this section.&#13;
5/    Toll levels in China are typically set just before opening of a new expressway.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
4.34        Impact of the Road Safety Program. The Road Safety Program (RSP) is&#13;
intended to improve sections of the existing NR 320 between Yuhang and Fengjing by the&#13;
addition of separate lanes for slow-moving bicycles and agricultural vehicles and the&#13;
improvement of intersection layouts. While the primary intent of the RSP is to reduce&#13;
traffic accidents, a beneficial side effect would be improvement of traffic flows on NR&#13;
320; this in turn would reduce the benefits associated with the Expressway and could&#13;
postpone the optimum date of opening. Analysis showed that the FYRR for the Yuhang-&#13;
Fengjing section of the expressway would be indeed be reduced considerably, to 7 percent&#13;
compared with 16 percent in the standard tolled case. However, the EIRR remains above&#13;
the 12 percent test discount rate. The EIRR of the expressway would be 32.5 percent and&#13;
the FYRR would decline to about 18% (Table 4.9) as compared with the tolled case&#13;
without Road Safety Program improvements presented in Table 4.8 (para 4.33).&#13;
4.35        Sensitivity Tests. As noted above, the evaluation results for the proposed&#13;
project depend critically on the assumptions regarding traffic growth in the Shanghai-&#13;
Hangzhou corridor, and the rate of traffic diversion to the new expressway. Alternative&#13;
lower rates developed for each of these parameters were used in the sensitivity analyses.&#13;
The sensitivity tests in all cases assumed tolling. The worst case for the expressway (i.e.,&#13;
with the Road Safety Program in the parallel highway, low diversion, and low traffic&#13;
growth) is shown in Table 4.10, and the results of the full range of sensitivity tests are&#13;
summarized in Table 4.11.&#13;
4.36        In none of the sensitivity tests for the expressway as a whole did the EIRR&#13;
drop below 14 percent, including the worst case scenario that combined construction cost&#13;
increases of 50%, benefit reduction caused by lower traffic growth, and lower diversion&#13;
to the new expressway. However, the FYRR did drop below the test discount rate of&#13;
12 percent in certain cases, indicating a possible case for postponement of construction.&#13;
Of these economic factors, low traffic growth rates had the largest effect, but on their own&#13;
would postpone the optimum opening date by two years for Fengjing-Songjiang section,&#13;
and by several years for the Yuhang-Fengjing section, running parallel and close to the&#13;
central section of NR 320 (with the RSP in place) in Zhejiang. Low diversion produces&#13;
balancing impacts: while less traffic uses the expressway, it enjoys a higher unit benefit&#13;
as a result of the more traffic and more congestion on the existing road. Because of this,&#13;
a low diversion rate on its own would postpone the optimum opening date of only the&#13;
Yuhang-Fengjing section by three years. Taking low traffic growth and a low diversion&#13;
rate together has the greatest impact, and would postpone the optimum opening date for&#13;
all three sections of the Expressway by between one and several years.&#13;
4.37        Conclusions. Based on current expectations of traffic growth, the evaluation&#13;
shows that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway is economically feasible if built to four-lane&#13;
standard on the proposed schedule of construction and operated as a tolled facility.&#13;
Construction to six-lane standard would not be warranted in the first instance, but the very&#13;
high traffic growth rates prevailing in the region support making provision for later&#13;
expansion.&#13;

C. EVALUATION OF THE ROAD SAFETY PROGRAM&#13;
4.38        The civil works subcomponent of the Road Safety Program comprises the&#13;
upgrading of about 86 km of NR 320 to provide separate lanes for bicycle and agricultural&#13;
vehicle traffic, and improvement of layouts for some 180 side road intersections. The area&#13;
selected for these investments lies entirely within Jiaxing Prefecture of Zhejiang Province,&#13;
and essentially comprises the central section of NR 320 between Fengjing and Yuhang.&#13;
The characteristics of the existing route, including geometric standards, past traffic growth&#13;
(Table 4.1), future traffic projections (Table 4.3), and estimates of traffic speed both with&#13;
and without the Road Safety Program (Table 4.4), were described earlier in connection&#13;
with the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway evaluation.&#13;
4.39        Evaluation Procedures. Project benefits derive from three sources: vehicle&#13;
operating cost savings, travel time savings, and traffic accident savings. Vehicle operating&#13;
cost and travel time savings were estimated on the same basis as for the expressway, in&#13;
fact using an identical evaluation model since the Road Safety Program involves sections&#13;
of the same roads as the Expressway evaluation. Congestion effects dominate, and&#13;
considerable benefits can be attributed to the Road Safety Program through improvements&#13;
in traffic operating conditions.&#13;
4.40        Traffic Accident Savings. Consideration was given to estimating the&#13;
number of traffic accidents, the economic cost of traffic accidents, and the accident&#13;
reduction likely to be brought about by the RSP. Traffic accident records indicate that the&#13;
number of traffic accidents on NR 320 is growing at about the same rate as traffic; in other&#13;
words, the traffic accident rate in terms of accidents per vehicle-km is constant. Total&#13;
accidents on NR 320 in Jiaxing in 1993 were as follows:&#13;
Fatal             265&#13;
Injury            361&#13;
Damage only       241&#13;
Based on available statistics, the ratio of slight to serious accidents was taken as 3:1.&#13;
4.41        For the purposes of evaluation, it was assumed that traffic accidents on&#13;
NR 320 would continue to grow in proportion to the growth in traffic. On this basis,&#13;
traffic accidents would continue to grow up to year 2000, drop upon opening of the&#13;
Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway in early 2000, and continue to grow thereafter. It was&#13;
assumed that the standard rate of diversion to the new expressway would apply (i.e.,&#13;
67 percent of all medium- and long-distance traffic) which is a worst-case scenario for&#13;
estimating RSP benefits.&#13;
4.42        Regarding accident reductions brought about by the project, experience&#13;
elsewhere indicates that a 40 percent reduction could be achieved through the intersection&#13;
improvements alone. Little data is available on the impact of providing separate traffic&#13;
lanes for slow-moving vehicles, but significant accident reductions should be achieved.&#13;
For this evaluation, a reduction in accidents of 60 percent for the total RSP was assumed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
4.43        Little research has been done on the cost of traffic accidents in China.&#13;
Official statistics undervalue these costs by considering only the direct costs of damage to&#13;
vehicles together with compensation (if any) paid to individuals and families. A thorough&#13;
economic valuation should include much more, including the full range of social costs&#13;
associated with providing emergency and medical services and the loss of economic&#13;
productivity resulting from injuries or death. The most recent comparable estimates of the&#13;
economic cost of accidents were made in 1987 as part of the China Road Safety Project&#13;
(Sichuan Pilot Study) under the Bank-financed Highway Project (Loan 2359-CHA/Credit&#13;
1594-CHA). Accident costs derived in Sichuan in 1987 were updated for evaluation of the&#13;
proposed Road Safety Program. Since the components of accident cost are very person-&#13;
intensive (productive work time lost, cost of medical and emergency services), unit costs&#13;
of accidents rise both with per capita GDP as well as with inflation. On this basis,&#13;
economic unit accident costs have likely risen by about three times since the Sichuan&#13;
estimates were made. The updated costs used for 1993 were as follows:&#13;
Fatal             Y 65,600&#13;
Serious injury    Y 18,160&#13;
Slight injury      Y 3,400&#13;
Damage only        Y  1,700&#13;
It was assumed that the unit cost of accidents would continue to grow in line with the&#13;
economy; a conservative 5 percent per year growth in costs was assumed for this analysis.&#13;
4.44        Construction Costs. Estimates of construction costs for the RSP were&#13;
derived using the same approach as for the expressway (para 4.29). Total financial costs&#13;
of construction were estimated at Y 247 million, and economic costs at Y 180 million&#13;
(Table 4.6). It is expected that works under the RSP can be completed by the end of&#13;
1997, with construction undertaken in nine separate packages.&#13;
4.45        Evaluation Results. The results of the evaluation are set out in Table 4.12.&#13;
The EIRR is estimated at 54 percent, with a first year rate of return (FYRR) of 79 percent,&#13;
providing good economic justification for the proposed RSP investments. Sensitivity tests&#13;
with (a) cost overrun of 50 percent, (b) lower than expected traffic growth, and (c)&#13;
accident reduction of 40 percent and 20 percent instead of the assumed 60 percent used in&#13;
the base case may be seen in Table 4.13. Even in the worst case scenario involving cost&#13;
increases, lowest level of accident reduction (20 percent), and lower traffic growth&#13;
reducing the benefits considerably, the EIRR is over 19 percent, well above the test rate&#13;
of 12 per cent, justifying the RSP. The FYRR in this worst case scenario is estimated at&#13;
about 19 percent, justifying implementation of the RSP in the time frame proposed. The&#13;
evaluation is dominated by the vehicle operating cost savings and the RSP would be&#13;
justified based on these savings. However, consideration of traffic accident savings alone&#13;
would also be sufficient to justify the RSP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D. SUMMARY OF EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT OF PRoJEcT RISKS&#13;
4.46        The comparison of costs and benefits for the project as a whole yields an&#13;
overall EIRR of 33.4 percent (Table 4.14). The overall evaluation takes into account costs&#13;
and benefits of both the new Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway, that creates substantial&#13;
additional traffic capacity, and the road improvements under the Road Safety Program, that&#13;
further enhance highway capacity in the project corridor.&#13;
4.47        The comparison of benefits and costs for the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway&#13;
component alone (the expressway operation under tolled conditions, without road safety&#13;
improvements in the corridor), yields an EIRR of approximately 32.8 percent (Table 4.8).&#13;
The result is influenced by the assumptions on traffic growth and the rate of traffic&#13;
diversion to the new expressway, both of which are difficult to assess under the current&#13;
conditions of very rapid economic growth. However, the evaluated EIRR is well above&#13;
the test discount rate of 12 percent, and would remain so even with quite different&#13;
assumptions on traffic growth and traffic diversion.&#13;
4.48        Assumptions on traffic growth and diversion do have a significant affect on&#13;
the optimum timing of the project, currently proposed for opening by 2000. Therefore,&#13;
the main risk is for slower traffic growth than anticipated, so that the planned expressway&#13;
construction schedule proves premature. This is considered unlikely, and not a sufficient&#13;
reason to delay construction. In fact, postponing construction would lead to a more&#13;
damaging risk of extreme congestion developing in the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor,&#13;
sufficient to seriously impede future economic growth.  It can be noted that the&#13;
conservative traffic growth assumed for the economic analysis above represents a&#13;
significant reduction in the traffic growths actually recorded over the past seven years.&#13;
4.49        Based on the standard traffic growth rates used for the economic evaluation,&#13;
the analyses indicate that expansion of the expressway from four-lane to six-lane standard&#13;
could be required by 2010. There is a risk that the extremely high current traffic rates&#13;
may continue longer than anticipated, sufficient to justify a six-lane standard for the initial&#13;
construction. However, there is uncertainty over future traffic growth rates such that&#13;
initial six-lane construction could not be warranted. The most advisable approach appears&#13;
to be the one adopted, of facilitating later expansion of expressway capacity by proper&#13;
design and certain advance works.&#13;
4.50        Because of the difficult subsoil conditions in sections of the alignment of the&#13;
Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway, there is a risk of delay in the completion of the&#13;
expressway and of reduced quality of the finished pavement. However, Zhejiang Province&#13;
(where most of the soft soils occur) is gaining experience of treating soft soils on the very&#13;
similar Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway now in construction under Bank financing, so the&#13;
risk is reduced.  Shanghai Municipality has also had relevant experience during&#13;
construction of the Xinzhuang-Songjiang Expressway.&#13;
4.51        The comparison of costs and benefits for the Road Safety Program yields an&#13;
estimated EIRR of 54 percent. Lower-than-anticipated traffic growth would reduce the rate&#13;
of return, but it would remain well above the test rate of 12 percent under all foreseeable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
circumstances. Implementation of the RSP is expected to be well within the capability of&#13;
Zhejiang Province and little risk is anticipated. There is a risk that the traffic accident&#13;
savings would not be as great as anticipated, or might require some modifications after&#13;
opening, but in a pioneering effort such as this one, some risk is necessary in seeking&#13;
effective solutions. Also, the proposed works would be worthwhile even on the grounds&#13;
of improving traffic operations.&#13;
4.52        Based on Bank experience with ongoing highway projects, there is&#13;
significant risk of delay in project implementation. However, both Shanghai Municipality&#13;
and Zhejiang Province have had experience with Bank infrastructure projects, which should&#13;
help implementation of the proposed project. Project preparation has also benefited&#13;
substantially from the Bank's previous experience with similar highway projects in China,&#13;
including the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Project, still under implementation.&#13;
Preparation has also benefited from the active involvement of MOC, the participation of&#13;
foreign experts in the design of project components and the preparation of bidding&#13;
documents and technical specifications, the stringent criteria used for the prequalification&#13;
of contractors and the careful formulation of supervision arrangements to ensure regular&#13;
monitoring of implementation and effective quality control.&#13;

coefficient of fitted curve.&#13;
(2)  The geometry of the existing highway is virtually identical to that for the expressway; the only difference&#13;
relates to the surface conditions. Since roughness affects speeds, operating costs between the two highway&#13;
classes will generally be measurably different, all else being equal.&#13;
(3)  Costs above represent free-flow operating costs; to obtain congested link costs, they should be factored by&#13;
[1 +0.2*v/c^2], where v/c is the link volume to capacity ratio.&#13;

MANAGEMENT OF THE HIGHWAY SECTOR&#13;
IN SHANGHAI AND ZHEJIANG&#13;
A. HIGHWAY ADMINETRATION&#13;
1.     The Shanghai Highway Management Department (SHMD), under the leadership&#13;
of the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Administration Bureau, is responsible for highway&#13;
planning, construction, maintenance and general administration of all highways in the&#13;
municipality. SHMD's activities include fund raising, planning and implementing new&#13;
construction projects. Routine administration activities include preparation of annual&#13;
construction and maintenance plans, completion of designs for new and upgraded roads,&#13;
review and approval of construction budgets, auditing of construction units, conduction of&#13;
supervision, monitoring, adoption and commissioning of all new construction projects, and&#13;
transferring of commissioned projects for operation and maintenance to relevant county (or&#13;
district) highway management bureaus.&#13;
2.      There are 21 administrative and technical sections functioning under the Highway&#13;
Management Division, with a total of 422 staff, including 266 engineering and technical&#13;
professionals. The SHMD has affiliated branches and in different localities and a highway&#13;
management office in each of ten counties. Seven organizations directly below SHMD&#13;
provide expertise in the areas of road and bridge engineering, municipal engineering,&#13;
management of specific expressways, toll collection, bridge prefabrication, and a technical&#13;
education.  In these subordinate organizations are 1,884 staff, including nearly 300&#13;
technicians. About 4,500 staff are working in SHMD's ten county (or district) highway&#13;
management departments, including 300 professional technicians (Chart 1).&#13;
3.      The Zhejiang Provincial Transport Department (ZPTD) controls all highway and&#13;
waterway transport undertakings in the Province. The ZPTD reports directly to the&#13;
Zhejiang Provincial People's Government (ZPG) and acts as an administrative arm of ZPG&#13;
for planning, budgeting and financing of transport in the Province. However, the ZPTD&#13;
conforms to the general transport policy and technical guidelines issued by MOC. The&#13;
Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration Bureau (ZPHAB), under the administration&#13;
of ZPTD, has 190 headquarters staff and is responsible for construction and maintenance&#13;
of all roads in the Province. Both the ZPTD and the ZPHAB are supported by local&#13;
administrations the various municipalities, prefectures and counties of the Province.&#13;
Zhejiang's 11 municipalities and prefectures. Each of the 69 counties has responsibility&#13;
under the municipality and prefectures for the maintenance of the county roads. The 11&#13;
municipalities and prefectures and the 69 county units have a permanent staff of 8,895, of&#13;
which technical personnel comprise about 10 percent (Chart 2).&#13;

a department level institution, reporting directly to ZPG and responsible for the&#13;
organization, direction and coordination of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway&#13;
Project (including construction of the Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway under the Zhejiang&#13;
Provincial Highway Project). Staff currently number 300, including 120 in offices in the&#13;
cities along the Hangzhou-Ningbo section, and 100 along the Shanghai-Hangzhou section&#13;
(Chart 3).&#13;
B. STAFF TRAIING&#13;
5.     To meet the requirements of highway development in Shanghai Municipality and&#13;
Zhejiang Province, great importance is attached to staff training programs. The training&#13;
process involves stages of planning and monitoring to improve the quality, management,&#13;
and benefits of training. The major areas of training include training for technical staff&#13;
and management; adaptive professional training to deepen various standardization; and&#13;
emergency training to meet the requirements of absorbing and digesting imported&#13;
techniques, renewing equipment, and of new technology, new materials, and new&#13;
equipment. During 1992, SHMD organized more than 100 training classes, involving&#13;
about 1,400 trainees from a wide variety of departments. The content of training covered&#13;
contract management for engineering, planning, computerized budgeting, quality standards,&#13;
road administration, management, construction project management, computer skills, and&#13;
automated toll collection.&#13;
6.      Staff training is offered to highway sector employees in Zhejiang Province&#13;
through the Transport Cadre School under the administration of ZPTD, covering the areas&#13;
of highway management and technology. Polytechnic students are also trained in the&#13;
school. In addition to classroom training, staff may pursue vocational study, learning from&#13;
the experiences of other provinces and municipalities. Practical experience in construction&#13;
and management is afforded through highway units for college and polytechnic students.&#13;
C. HIGHWAY PLANNING, BUDGETING AND FINANCING&#13;
7.     Planning and budgeting for highway sector activities are carried out by the&#13;
relevant provincial agencies in Shanghai and Zhejiang (paras 1-4 above), with technical&#13;
guidance and approvals of major investments provided by central and provincial&#13;
government authorities. The MOC is the central agency coordinating construction of&#13;
national trunk highways, including examination and approval of preliminary design, and,&#13;
in some cases, including grants for investment (paras 1.16-1.17). Planning for the&#13;
Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway has involved MOC, State Planning Commission (SPC),&#13;
State Council at central government levels, and at provincial levels, a coordination team&#13;
with representatives from municipal government, and construction, foreign economic&#13;
relations and trade, finance, and engineering design agencies. For smaller scale highway&#13;
investment and maintenance works in Shanghai and Zhejiang, implementation responsibility&#13;
is often assigned to municipal, county, prefecture, or village level transport and highway&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113-                    ANNEX I&#13;
agencies. As with major investment and recurring expenditures, a system of investment&#13;
planning, technical reviews and project approvals is used, but would typically be&#13;
coordinated at the provincial level.&#13;
8.     SHMD is the operational unit responsible for planning and budgeting highway&#13;
sector activities in Shanghai Municipality.  Each year, a yearly construction and&#13;
maintenance plan is formulated, early stage design of new reconstru;tion engineering is&#13;
undertaken, the budget is examined and approved, and qualificationi of contractors are&#13;
examined.  SHMD  supervises, inspects, and approves the quality of engineering&#13;
construction; after completion of works, authority is transferred to counties or districts for&#13;
maintenance and management. ZPTD has overall responsibility for planning investments&#13;
in and maintaining the Zhejiang provincial highway network. ZPTD prepares the five-year&#13;
road development plan and semi-annual budgets using inputs from lower level&#13;
administrative groups and incorporating national or provincial development policy&#13;
guidelines and objectives for the plan period.&#13;
9.      China's highway sector agencies have traditionally followed a balanced budget&#13;
policy, where proposed highway investment and recurring expenditures are balanced&#13;
against the revenue earmarked for highway development and available road user charges.&#13;
This pattern was followed in Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province until the late&#13;
1980's: since then, the matching of revenues and expenditures has not been possible.&#13;
Shanghai has adopted measures to expand and diversify funding, including borrowing,&#13;
trying to attract investment from other sectors, and rationalization of the environment for&#13;
private investment. In Zhejiang, a special fund is now maintained for the construction of&#13;
high grade highways. The fund is capitalized by contributions from MOC and allocations&#13;
of earmarked and surplus road user charges.&#13;
10.    As elsewhere in China, the main source of funds for road construction and&#13;
maintenance in Shanghai and Zhejiang is the road maintenance fee (RMF). These funds&#13;
are collected by highway units at different levels and managed by the provincial highway&#13;
agency.  The revenues from  road maintenance fees are distributed as follows:&#13;
(a) 15 percent is remitted to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) as the Energy and Transport&#13;
Fund; (b) 10 percent is transferred to the State Budget Adjustment Fund; (c) 3 percent is&#13;
remitted to the traffic police (Public Security Bureau); and (d) 72 percent is retained by&#13;
provincial highway authorities.&#13;
11.    The current standards for RMF in Shanghai are based on use and weight of&#13;
vehicles. The RMF rate is 15 percent of annual revenue for vehicles of state-owned&#13;
transportation companies, 8.5 percent of income for vehicles of taxi or tourist companies,&#13;
and 5 percent of income for mass transit vehicles. Vehicles of the communist party and&#13;
government organizations, public agencies, and schools are exempted from certain RMF&#13;
fees: there is no RMF collected for cars and jeeps, and a 50 percent reduction for other&#13;
vehicles. The remaining vehicles in Shanghai pay Y 140 per month per ton capacity as&#13;
RMF. RMF rates in Zhejiang vary according to the type and size of vehicles, as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-114-                     ANNEX 1&#13;
15 percent of gross revenue for state transport companies; Y 120 per month per payload&#13;
ton or Y 120 per month per 10 passenger seats of vehicles owned by collective and private&#13;
transport companies; and Y 70 per month for passenger cars.&#13;
12.    The highway department revenues and expenditures in both Shanghai and&#13;
Zhejiang show a trend of rapidly increasing expenditures for construction and highway&#13;
reconstruction since the mid-80s. By 1993, these categories comprised 90 percent and 79&#13;
percent of expenditures in Shanghai and Zhejiang, respectively. In Shanghai Municipality,&#13;
total revenues and expenditures for the highway sector grew by 29 percent and 37 percent&#13;
per year respectively between 1985 and 1993. Municipal government contributions have&#13;
been the fastest-growing category of revenues, and RMF revenues have grown at 21&#13;
percent per year. The fastest growing categories of expenditure were new construction and&#13;
reconstruction at 51 percent per year, followed by periodic maintenance and&#13;
Expressway/Class I highway construction, both at 30 percent per year. In Zhejiang&#13;
Province, total revenues and expenditures for the highway sector grew by 25 percent and&#13;
24 percent per year between 1985 and 1993. The fastest growing category of revenues&#13;
was the fund for high-class highways (para 2.33), at 50 percent per year. The fastest&#13;
growing categories of expenditure were expressway construction at 67 percent per year,&#13;
and overhead and administration at 30 percent per year (Attachments 1 and 2).&#13;
13.    Other sources of highway sector funding in Shanghai and Zhejiang include vehicle&#13;
purchase fees, central and provincial government grants, loans raised from domestic and&#13;
international banks, tolls, surcharges on passenger and freight transport (Zhejiang only),&#13;
and funds raised from local enterprises (Shanghai only).&#13;
14.    Tolls are an increasingly important revenue source for the Shanghai road&#13;
authorities. In 1993 alone, about $15 million was raised through tolling. At present, all&#13;
tolls are charged on a fixed rate basis (i.e., not dependent on distance travelled). A system&#13;
of tolling has been introduced on two urban expressways, the Shanghai-Jiading and&#13;
Xinzhuang-Songjiang Expressways. Toll standards are based on loading capacity, as&#13;
follows: vehicles of 2 tons or less, 5 yuan; vehicles over 2 tons and up to 5 tons, 10&#13;
yuan; vehicles over 5 tons and up to 10 tons, 20 yuan; and for vehicles over 10 tons, 20&#13;
yuan for every 10 tons capacity. Toll revenues are used for maintenance, loan repayment,&#13;
administration of toll operations and, as available, for new construction.&#13;
15.    Since March 1993, tolls have also been levied on all vehicles entering Shanghai,&#13;
through collection points on the ten major roads providing access to the Municipality. The&#13;
toll standard is based on capacity, as follows: for two- or three-wheel motorcycles, 5&#13;
yuan; vehicles up to 2 tons, 10 yuan; vehicles from 2 tons to tons, 30 yuan; from 5 tons&#13;
to 10 tons, 70 yuan; and for more than 10 tons, the 10-ton toll plus 30 yuan for each&#13;
additional 10 tons. Vehicles registered in Shanghai pay these tolls in conjunction with the&#13;
RMF, at a rate of 49 yuan per ton per month (or a 25 percent surcharge on the RMF) and&#13;
therefore are not stopped at the Shanghai border to pay tolls. While an effective fund-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-115 -                     ANNEX 1&#13;
raising mechanism, the collection of tolls at the border creates congestion and obstacles to&#13;
interprovincial traffic movement.&#13;
16.    There are no major tolled highways or expressways in operation in Zhejiang.&#13;
However, tolls are collected for certain bridges and tunnels. Revenues collected are used&#13;
to cover the cost of toll management operations and repayment of bank loans. Surplus&#13;
revenue is used for construction and reconstruction of local highw ys. Toll rates are&#13;
established according to the financing characteristics of the project aid approved by the&#13;
provincial government.&#13;
D. HIGHWAY ENGINEERING, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINENANCE&#13;
17.    The design of highway projects in Shanghai and Zhejiang is entrusted to&#13;
municipal and provincial design institutes. The relevant institutes for highway and bridge&#13;
design are Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute (SMEDI) and Shanghai&#13;
Municipal Construction Design Institute (SMCDI). SMEDI is a special design unit for&#13;
municipal engineering and public engineering, qualified to undertake the design of&#13;
plumbing work, gas heating, road, bridges, tunnel, flood control works, and environmental&#13;
protection engineering for first class cities and the survey and geological examination for&#13;
first class engineering. SMEDI has staff of more than 900, including 650 professional&#13;
technicians, in which 170 are senior technicians. SMCDI has staff of 322, including 257&#13;
professional technicians and senior staff. For less complicated projects, universities and&#13;
other institutes (such as the design institutes of Tongji University, Design Institute of&#13;
Shanghai Municipal Construction Institute, and Shanghai Municipal Engineering Research&#13;
Institute) are retained. Design of the Shanghai expressway section under the proposed&#13;
project has been entrusted to SMEDI, which also completed design of the adjacent&#13;
Xinzhuang-Songjiang section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway.&#13;
18.    The construction of road projects is usually arranged by provincial highway&#13;
authorities in Shanghai and Zhejiang under administrative planning, mobilizing different&#13;
direct-reporting units and highway bureaus to carry out construction works. For key&#13;
construction projects, engineering bureaus at municipal level take direct responsibility, but&#13;
this responsibility may be devolved for smaller-scale works. It is becoming more common&#13;
to award civil works contracts through competitive bidding and to hold contractors&#13;
responsible for the timely completion of the project, quality, price, and safety. However,&#13;
implementation experience suggests that the provincial highway agencies would benefit&#13;
from more specific knowledge of and practical experience in managing the construction&#13;
under contracts.&#13;
19.    Road and bridge projects in Zhejiang Province are engineered by the planning and&#13;
design institutes at provincial, prefecture, and county levels. The Zhejiang Provincial&#13;
Transport Design Institute (ZPTDI) is responsible for designing all major road, bridge, and&#13;
tunnel projects, with total staff of 370 including 158 professional engineers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116-                    ANNEX I&#13;
20.    After the completion of construction and inspection, the responsibility for roads&#13;
is transferred to county (district) highway management bureaus for routine maintenance.&#13;
Maintenance is carried out through mostly labor intensive means: however, in recent&#13;
years, the level of mechanization of road maintenance, facilitated by the import of&#13;
specialized equipment, has reduced labor intensity. There are currently 2,760 maintenance&#13;
staff and engineers working for the SHMD including 2,491 in maintenance, 182 in&#13;
gardening, and 87 in administration.&#13;
21.    Roads are examined by provincial and lower-level highway bureaus on a regular&#13;
basis to ensure that MOC's Highway Maintenance Standards are being met.  Among&#13;
MOC's rating criteria (fine, good, poor, bad), the percent of total mileage in "fine' and&#13;
"good" categories is monitored. Maintenance operations are divided between routine&#13;
maintenance and periodic (heavy) maintenance. Periodic maintenance is performed&#13;
according to criteria of pavement structure, traffic volume and road importance, and based&#13;
on actual damaged of pavement. In Zhejiang Province, for example, periodic maintenance&#13;
is carried out every seven to eight years or when daily traffic volume exceeds 5,000 to&#13;
7,000 vph/d on bituminous surfaces. The average annual cost of routine maintenance for&#13;
all roads in Shanghai was 14,900 yuan per km in 1993. The average cost of maintenance&#13;
for county and village roads in Zhejiang in 1993 ranged from 800 to Y 1,200 per km. The&#13;
average cost of maintenance for national roads in Zhejiang in 1993 was Y 14,300 per km.&#13;

ROAD SAFETY PROGRAM&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.          The proposed Shanghai-Zhejiang Highway Project has as one of its main&#13;
objectives the improvement of road safety in the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor. This Annex&#13;
provides background information on road safety in China, provides a more in-depth review&#13;
of road safety in Jiaxing Municipality and then details the pilot Road Safety Program (RSP)&#13;
included in the proposed project.&#13;
2.          The People's Republic of China has included in its series of five-year plans&#13;
at national and local levels an ambitious program for development of the road network.&#13;
During the past four decades, over 1.02 million kilometers of highways have been&#13;
constructed and consequently vehicle numbers have also increased substantially during this&#13;
period. China imported its first motor vehicle in 1901; by 1949, registrations were&#13;
approximately 50,000. By 1978, registrations had grown to 1.36 million, and by the end&#13;
of 1993, close to 8.8 million. Vehicle traffic growth rates of up to 30 percent per annum&#13;
are recorded on some roads in the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor; nationally, the average&#13;
growth rate in registered motor vehicles is now around 20 percent per annum. Road traffic&#13;
accidents have, of course, followed the broad upward trend in growth of traffic, resulting&#13;
in an ever-increasing toll on human life and damage to property. Road safety is now&#13;
becoming recognized as a serious problem (paras 1.15-1.16).&#13;
3.          Road safety in Jiaxing Municipality follows a similar pattern to that which&#13;
exists in other southern provinces of China. This municipality, chosen for the RSP pilot&#13;
program, represents a single administrative area within Zhejiang Province that contains&#13;
major portions of the proposed Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway as well as National Route&#13;
(NR) 320, one of the principal highway routes between Shanghai and Hangzhou.&#13;
4.          The object of the RSP is to reduce, and eventually to reverse, the current&#13;
trend in the growth of accidents in the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor. Clearly this will not&#13;
be possible within the short duration of the RSP. For this reason the program contains&#13;
elements of technical assistance, training and institution building to support the engineering&#13;
proposals, so that an improvement in general road safety procedures and institutional&#13;
capability will result, increasing the likelihood of sustainable road safety activity in the&#13;
longer term.&#13;
B. RoAD SAFETY IN CHNA&#13;
5.          Although vehicle ownership levels in China are still very low, the motorized&#13;
fleet has sustained very high rates of growth in recent years. If the current growth rates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -                         ANNEX 2&#13;
(at or above 20 percent per year in some areas) continue, the year 2000 will see a&#13;
quadrupling of existing traffic levels. While China's transport network has also been&#13;
developing rapidly, the density of the network remains comparatively low. The annual&#13;
increases in road network length have only been around 6 percent to 7 percent, clearly&#13;
failing to keep pace with the growing traffic demand.&#13;
6.           Although road safety is already a major problem in China, the complex&#13;
nature of the problem is only beginning to be addressed; detailed information on road&#13;
accidents at a national level is not readily available. It is therefore not possible to make&#13;
reliable national comparisons of accident characteristics.   Nevertheless, based on&#13;
information obtained from some areas of China, it can be estimated that national road&#13;
accident fatality rates are (in relation to number of motor vehicles) as much as 30 times&#13;
those experienced in the industrialized world. While a high rate would be expected in a&#13;
country at early stages of motorization, the level, and the fact that current accident rates&#13;
suggest an ever-increasing number of accidents, point to the seriousness of the issue and&#13;
the continual, expanding drain on resources.&#13;
7.           An earlier World Bank study with the Chinese Institute of Highwaysl/&#13;
indicated that road accidents accounted for around 40 percent of all accidental deaths in&#13;
the Sichuan area. Since traffic levels in China have at least doubled since that time, it is&#13;
likely that this proportion could have increased. Even if it has remained static this&#13;
represents a huge loss in manpower to the economy of China. It has been estimated 2/&#13;
that road accidents cost developing countries at least 1 percent of their Gross Domestic&#13;
Product, a cost which such countries can ill afford. Evidence from the above-mentioned&#13;
study indicates that China is experiencing a similar magnitude of losses due to road&#13;
accidents.&#13;
8.           Some road safety work is carried out at a national level in China, and the&#13;
multi-disciplinary nature of the problem is recognized. For instance, there is a system of&#13;
road safety education built in to the school curriculum and compulsory driver education&#13;
has been introduced as part of the driver licensing procedure. There is also evidence of&#13;
attempts at standardization to ensure safer road designs, for example, through the&#13;
formulation of national standards for the design of highways. These documents provide&#13;
specifications for many safety aspects of highway design including sight distances, merging&#13;
lanes and minimum radii. The Road Traffic Signs and Markings manual contains details&#13;
of traffic signs, road markings and sets out how various types of junctions should be laid&#13;
out. Unfortunately, many of these standards were developed when traffic levels were low;&#13;
some are no longer relevant and require revision.&#13;
9.           Additional draft standards for the newly introduced expressways have been&#13;
drawn up more recently to deal with a number of issues, such as grade separated&#13;
interchanges, not covered by the general design standards, but as many of those responsible&#13;

for road safety and highway design in China cannot themselves drive, their ability to&#13;
recognize safety-related design problems is diminished. The result is that Chinese design&#13;
standards are not always appropriate, or appropriately applied. The revision of these&#13;
standards should be a longer term goal.&#13;
C. TH  ExsTNG ROAD SAFETY SITUATION IN JIANG&#13;
10.         The Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor is situated on the southeastern coastal&#13;
fringe of China to the south of the Yangtze river and southwest of Shanghai. The corridor&#13;
is very flat and is protected from the sea by a dike running the whole length of the&#13;
coastline. This coastal area includes Provincial Route 01. The region dominated by&#13;
Shanghai, extends between Shanghai and Hangzhou in a mainly agriculture-intensive area.&#13;
In comparison to much of the rest of China, the area is densely developed and, as a&#13;
consequence, has a higher density of roads. As a result, the area exhibits a particularly&#13;
high level of traffic growth; some roads have annual rates of increase in traffic volume of&#13;
around 30 percent, and average overall exceeded 20 percent during the past five years.&#13;
11.         The Zhejiang section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway is contained&#13;
within three municipalities with only small sections in two of the municipalities. The&#13;
corridor runs the entire width of Jiaxing Municipality; for this reason, Jiaxing has been&#13;
chosen as the location for the proposed RSP.&#13;
12.         Information on the existing road safety situation has been obtained from&#13;
discussions with the Traffic Policy section of the Public Security Bureau. It is apparent&#13;
that current accident levels are of concern to the authorities. In Jiaxing 1,638 people have&#13;
been killed and over 22,000 accidents have occurred on the roads in the 10-year period&#13;
from 1983 to 1992. The numbers being killed and injured annually has increased steadily&#13;
in recent years: deaths have increased nearly 400 percent since 1985 while the number of&#13;
persons injured has increased by 250 percent. In 1992 alone, 288 persons were killed and&#13;
474 persons were crippled or injured in the 2,727 road accidents reported to the police.&#13;
Increasing numbers of accidents lead to more and more manpower requirements for the&#13;
police. Recording accidents and the processing of the prosecutions which ensue is an ever&#13;
increasing task.&#13;
13.         At the same time, road accidents are often under-reported to the police.&#13;
Despite this, the reported road accident growth rate in Jiaxing Municipality is currently&#13;
running at about 3 percent to 5 percent per annum. This situation will exist for many&#13;
years, even if the authorities are able to allocate sufficient resources to ensure a turn-&#13;
around in the accident rate. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, there will be a&#13;
requirement for the municipal authorities to devote extra resources to the Traffic Police,&#13;
emergency services, medical services including hospitals and engineering repair services.&#13;
The table below indicates how accidents have increased in the municipality over recent&#13;
years.&#13;
14.         In order to appreciate the true scale of the accident problem in a country it&#13;
is common practice to relate traffic accidents to demographic or other data, and to compare&#13;
such relationships between countries. The most meaningful statistic for international&#13;

/a  From 1987, data on both rural and urban accidents were included. Prior to 1987, only rural accidents&#13;
were reported because different agencies were responsible for collecting data in rural and urban areas.&#13;

comparison is the "accident rate" (in units of accidents of deaths per million vehicle&#13;
kilometers). At this time, however, adequate information on vehicle usage is not available&#13;
to be able to calculate this rate for the whole of Jiaxing. Information is, however,&#13;
available for the NR 320 where the accident rate is nearly 2.7 per million vehicle-km.&#13;
Compared to a similar standard of road in the most developed countries this rate is four&#13;
to six times higher. While China's unique situation as a country in the early stages of&#13;
motorization as China is noted (para 2), the seriousness of the road safety problem should&#13;
not be dismissed.&#13;
15.          Cost of Road Accidents to the Jiaxing Economy. Apart from the human&#13;
losses incurred, road accidents can also be shown to be a very serious drain upon the&#13;
economy of Jiaxing. International research indicates that annual losses from road accidents&#13;
(when all related costs such as medical treatment, lost production, property damage, police&#13;
and court costs are taken into account) typically amount to 1-2 percent of Gross Domestic&#13;
Product (GDP) of a country. In China, Gross Output Value of Agriculture and Industry&#13;
(GOVAI) can be used as a proxy for GDP. The equivalent losses resulting from road&#13;
accidents in Jiaxing in 1992 would have been around 1-2 percent of GOVAI. This gives&#13;
an annual loss from road accidents in Jiaxing alone of between US$28 and US$56 million.&#13;
Specific research undertaken to establish typical accident costs in China, as part of an&#13;
earlier study in 1987 (para 7) indicate that the absolute minimum cost of road accidents in&#13;
Jiaxing in 1987 was likely to have been nearly US$7 million per year. The studies showed&#13;
that the true costs were probably much higher than this figure. If these values are updated&#13;
at 10 percent per annum, the minimum total cost of accidents in 1992 would have been&#13;
around $20 million. Recurring annual losses of even $20 million/year are clearly a serious&#13;
drain on the provincial economy and, unless remedial action is taken, losses will continue&#13;
to increase.&#13;
16.          This magnitude of losses is likely to accelerate in future years if appropriate&#13;
action is not taken soon. The present motorized vehicle traffic is growing at rates as high&#13;
as 30 percent per annum on some roads in the Province. The present traffic levels are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -                       ANNEX 2&#13;
already causing serious congestion in towns and road safety problems on parts of the&#13;
existing road network; further increases in traffic will certainly worsen the situation and&#13;
increase the numbers of accidents and casualties. This is corroborated by the annual&#13;
accident rates which are currently increasing by 3 to 5 percent per annum. This rate&#13;
represents a doubling of accident numbers in about 14 years, which would impose large&#13;
public costs in terms of policing, medical facilities and other related remedial services.&#13;
17.         Many different factors contribute to Jiaxing's high rate of accidents: the&#13;
most effective way to make significant improvements is to develop a comprehensive road&#13;
safety improvement plan for the Province involving improvements to those areas which&#13;
most affect road safety. Such a plan should include vehicle roadworthiness testing, driver&#13;
training/testing, publicity/education, emergency medical services, traffic law enforcement,&#13;
legislation, road safety research, accident blackspot improvements, and traffic/highway&#13;
design standards. As a first step towards that provincial plan, under the project efforts&#13;
would be concentrated in those areas most closely related to highway construction and&#13;
which are likely to lead to large initial benefits in terms of accident reduction. This takes&#13;
the form of safety-conscious designs for jurisdictions and the links between them.&#13;
18.         While the Zhejiang Provincial Communications Department (ZPCD) cannot&#13;
resolve the road safety problem independently, it can undertake actions within the areas&#13;
under its direct control. At the same time, improving liaison and cooperation between key&#13;
agencies such as the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration Bureau (ZPHAB) and&#13;
Zhejiang Public Security Bureau at the provincial levels, and including the Jiaxing&#13;
Highway Administration Bureau (JHAB) and Jiaxing Traffic Police at local levels are also&#13;
essential, primarily in order to identify specific locations, for example, on the Jiaxing road&#13;
network where accidents repeatedly occur (i.e., accident blackspots). ZPCD can then&#13;
design appropriate engineering improvements which can be implemented in future years,&#13;
to reduce accident occurrence at such locations.&#13;
D. CURRENT ROAD SAFETY AcrvmEs&#13;
19.         A program of action aimed at accident reduction to be successful, needs to&#13;
address three main areas. These are:&#13;
(a)   Education;&#13;
(b)   Enforcement; and&#13;
(c)   Engineering.&#13;
A successful outcome for the program depends on a certain minimum level of action taking&#13;
place on each of these agendas. The three are loosely interlinked and whilst action in any&#13;
one area will produce results, efforts directed at the appropriate sections in all three areas&#13;
will yield additional benefits.&#13;
20.         Maximum reduction in accidents can only be achieved with a comprehensive&#13;
road safety effort encompassing all aspects of these three areas, ranging from interventions&#13;
such as school lessons to changes in Government policy. Clearly such a plan is beyond&#13;
the scope of this pilot project. However, it is important to ensure that the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -                       ANNEX 2&#13;
proposals mesh with existing work so that the program maximizes the benefits which can&#13;
be gained by combining this program with ongoing efforts in the field of road safety.&#13;
21.         Education.  China has a comprehensive road safety education system&#13;
involving schools, drivers and the general public. Currently lessons on road safety form&#13;
part of the school curriculum, drivers attend compulsory training classes and there is&#13;
widespread publicity on road safety issues. All manner of media are used in this campaign&#13;
including television, newspapers, theater, radio, wall slogans and public notice boards.&#13;
A hard-hitting campaign using "shock" tactics is employed in all towns and cities where&#13;
notice boards contain photographs of actual accidents and the victims, explaining who was&#13;
at fault and what the consequences were. This is supported by a generalized road safety&#13;
slogan.&#13;
22.         Enforcement. While general observation of driver behavior is one good&#13;
way of identifying enforcement requirements, another is through the analysis of road&#13;
accidents. Currently accident data are stored in a computer system based on a classic&#13;
database-type program. This enables a limited amount of analysis work to be undertaken,&#13;
but only by interrogating the data base on specific locations or lengths of road. The&#13;
greatest drawback to this type of system is that the problem locations cannot be identified&#13;
from the data alone; a third party input is required to direct the initial search. Using this&#13;
system it is not easy to identify a problem requiring police enforcement without knowing&#13;
of its existence and searching for the appropriate data.&#13;
23.         Engineering. Similarly, unless an engineer is aware of, for example, a&#13;
turning problem at a particular type of junction, the existing data system will not identify&#13;
it unless the relevant data are searched. This is a weakness in the system and means that&#13;
scarce resources are not currently being directed to the problems most in need of attention&#13;
and resolution.&#13;
24.         All these point to a present weakness in the chain of events which must take&#13;
place in order to improve road safety. The proposed pilot road safety program described&#13;
below has been designed to reduce or eliminate present weaknesses in order to leave a&#13;
lasting improvement to the systems established to tackle road safety in the corridor.&#13;
E. OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVING ROAD SAFETY&#13;
25.         As outlined above a number of critical weaknesses were identified in road&#13;
safety activities during the various missions. The main ones are:&#13;
*     Accident analysis and identification of causes&#13;
*     Implementation of accident remedial measures&#13;
*     Change in attitude towards design philosophy&#13;
26.         In designing the pilot program, particular attention has been given to actions&#13;
which can be taken to improve road safety by supporting the work which is currently being&#13;
undertaken. These actions can be grouped into those which are related to accident&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -                         ANNEX 2&#13;
prevention and those which are related to accident reduction. The sorts of activities which&#13;
need to be introduced under each of these areas is indicated below.&#13;
27.          Accident Prevention. While it is accepted that a certain level of road safety&#13;
is already implicit in existing design standards and practices, even greater emphasis is&#13;
needed on incorporating additional features/facilities which will enhance road safety&#13;
especially for the most vulnerable groups such as pedestrians and cyclists. This is&#13;
particularly important as increasing traffic levels will almost certainly bring increasing&#13;
accidents unless preventive action is taken.&#13;
28.          A vital element of any road safety program is therefore the provision of&#13;
technical assistance to make available the accumulation of experience gained in the more&#13;
motorized societies to those at the early stages of motorization.&#13;
29.          A more "safety conscious" approach to planning/designing road networks&#13;
is required so that newly built roads do not become unsafe in future years when traffic&#13;
levels increase. Standard layouts of signing, marking, etc. at commonly encountered&#13;
hazards needs to be developed so that drivers always encounter a consistent treatment when&#13;
they approach such features. This will aid driver recognition of potential hazards and&#13;
increase awareness, hopefully reducing errors.&#13;
30.          A road safety "audit" or checking, system could also be developed. This&#13;
would ensure that safety has been given adequate attention in the highway planning and&#13;
design process. Such safety audit systems are increasingly being introduced, even in the&#13;
industrialized countries, as they have been found to be a very effective way to avoid future&#13;
road safety problems. The UK, for example, requires all proposed road schemes to be&#13;
subjected to a road safety audit at three stages:&#13;
Stage 1      Completion of preliminary design (during feasibility stage)&#13;
Stage 2      Completion of detailed design&#13;
Stage 3      Completion of construction (prior to opening)&#13;
31.          While both the Provincial Communications Department and Highway&#13;
Administration Bureau have a major interest in road safety issues, enforcement is largely&#13;
a responsibility of the Traffic Police (a unit within the Public Security Bureau). As a&#13;
result, neither the Traffic Police nor the highway agencies are able to identify locations on&#13;
the network which would benefit from specific enforcement activity except by the fact that&#13;
accidents are occurring at such locations. This is basically due to the type of accident&#13;
recording system which is used. Although computer-based, it lacks the ability to provide&#13;
easy identification of accident clusters, either geographically or by type. The provision&#13;
of equipment which can do this will contribute to the objective of reducing accidents.&#13;
32.          Accident Reduction. Accident reduction is concerned with making the&#13;
existing highway network operate as safely as possible. It requires that those responsible&#13;
for introducing improvements make themselves aware of the locations of, and nature of the&#13;
accidents at, the worst accident blackspots on the network. Appropriate engineering&#13;
improvements can then be made to reduce the number of accidents. This requires either:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -                       ANNEX 2&#13;
regular and systematic collection of information on the most dangerous locations from&#13;
Traffic Police offices in each region; or, the introduction of a computerized accident&#13;
analysis system (such as MAAP, proposed under "Technical Assistance, Training, and&#13;
Equipment" below) so that accident data can be easily interrogated to produce detailed&#13;
analyses of data at accident blackspots for each region.&#13;
33.         Speed is often a major contributory factor in accidents, yet there are at&#13;
present no portable speed measuring devices available from the engineering staff to assess&#13;
current actual speeds at accident locations.&#13;
34.         Despite the problems of lack of equipment and lack of awareness of modem&#13;
analysis techniques, some work aimed at accident reduction does take place in Jiaxing and&#13;
some accident remedial measure work is undertaken. Observation and discussions suggest&#13;
that the identification of blackspots seems to be on a very limited scale, haphazard, and&#13;
relies on local knowledge of the Traffic Police or on local pressure to ask for an&#13;
investigation to be undertaken. The types of measures resulting from this approach are&#13;
very limited. Examples are the provision of traffic signs and limited road marking&#13;
schemes. There appears to be no system for providing funding for changes in the highway&#13;
layout even where this may be a primary cause of accidents at that location.&#13;
35.         Adoption of modem techniques and methods outlined above will, in the&#13;
longer term, enable the development of suitable engineering measures which should&#13;
improve road safety province wide. However, as a first step in the reduction of accidents,&#13;
under the proposed RSP, a program of accident reduction measures has been developed&#13;
with the objective of reducing accidents on NR 320, a road that is the source of over&#13;
60 percent of the accidents in the Jiaxing area. The RSP was designed as a pilot scheme,&#13;
containing elements which will be applicable to the majority of roads in the Shanghai-&#13;
Hangzhou corridor, and potentially to other corridors in China.&#13;
F. PILOT ROAD SAFETY PROGRAM&#13;
36.         The format for a typical comprehensive road safety component of an&#13;
assistance package would normally concentrate on institutional strengthening across a&#13;
number of sectors, rather than only identifying a major program of site-specific measures.&#13;
The consequence of such more comprehensive programs is that it often takes a&#13;
considerable time before effective physical measures can be implemented and the benefits&#13;
of the component can be demonstrated. This also assumes that the recipient country can&#13;
make sufficient funds available for the continuing work of the road safety teams set up&#13;
under the project.&#13;
37.         The road safety component of this project has, however, been given a&#13;
different emphasis.  While it includes institutional strengthening in selected areas of&#13;
weakness, the program would ensure that some road safety benefits be provided in the&#13;
short-term with a demonstration effect that could encourage other local highway authorities&#13;
to emulate the work, expanding the overall benefits of the program. This approach&#13;
required the early identification of appropriate physical works which could be implemented&#13;
in parallel with the construction of the expressway. The high incidence of accidents on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

NR 320 warrants the introduction of remedial measures along this route, in particular in&#13;
greater Jiaxing.&#13;
38.         As identified earlier there are three major areas of weakness in the current&#13;
chain of action required to improve road safety. These are:&#13;
(a)   Accident analysis and identification of causes;&#13;
(b)   Implementation of accident remedial measures; and&#13;
(c)   Change in attitude towards design philosophy.&#13;
Accordingly, the RSP has been designed to strengthen each of these three areas. Actions&#13;
required are fairly basic at this stage as the concept of improving road safety by proactive&#13;
rather than reactive means appears still to be a novel approach in China. Subcomponents&#13;
aimed at improving these three main areas of weakness were agreed for the RSP&#13;
component of the project: Civil Works, Equipment/Software Provision, and Technical&#13;
Assistance/Training.&#13;

39.         Along the roads in the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor, safety problems of a&#13;
similar type occur repeatedly on all classes of roads and throughout the highway network.&#13;
There are also specific problems relating to particular classes of roads. Some of these&#13;
problems can be resolved through engineering improvements; the main thrust of these&#13;
improvements needs to be directed towards segregating motor vehicle and non-motor&#13;
vehicle traffic. As a consequence, a program of civil works has been devised, aimed&#13;
specifically at improving design philosophy and providing practice in implementing some&#13;
typical features based on safer designs. This component divides naturally into three&#13;
sections, for the purposes of description, NR 320 main carriageway, junctions with NR&#13;
320 and structures required to facilitate the first two sections.&#13;
40.         Main Road. For the NR 320, the component consists of widening the&#13;
carriageway and segregating different traffic types. The carriageway is to be widened by&#13;
the addition of two separate 3.5 m wide "slow vehicle" lanes, one on either side of the&#13;
existing road. Segregation is achieved by separating the new lanes from the existing by&#13;
both a horizontal shift of 1.5 m and a vertical shift of 0.5 m.&#13;
41.         In addition to the extra two "slow vehicle" lanes, the main carriageway&#13;
would also be widened. Currently it consists of two 3.75 m motorized traffic lanes, one&#13;
on either side of the centerline, and two outer 2.0 m wide "other vehicle" lanes adjacent&#13;
to them. Whenever a vehicle breaks down, or stops to load or unload goods, it parks in&#13;
this 2.0-m lane. Since most trucks are about 2.5 m wide and drivers allow 0.5 m&#13;
clearance to the edge of paved carriageway, the parked or broken down vehicle often&#13;
projects at least 1 m into the motorized vehicle lane, reducing its width to 2.75 m. Many&#13;
trucks in China have steering systems which make placing them to within 0.25 m difficult,&#13;
particularly at high speed. The result is that to pass the stationary vehicle they often&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -                        ANNEX 2&#13;
infringe into the opposing lane, particularly if the load is wider than the vehicle body, with&#13;
potential for direct, head-on conflict with vehicles approaching from the opposite direction.&#13;
Since trucks form around 60 percent of the vehicle fleet this is a very common situation&#13;
and significantly increases the risk of head-on collisions at such locations.&#13;
42.          Another common scenario which increases risk is when a vehicle swerves&#13;
into the "slow" lane to avoid an oncoming vehicle which has crossed the centerline during&#13;
an overtaking maneuver.&#13;
43.         Mixed traffic of widely differing average speeds on the same carriageway&#13;
leads to the faster vehicles constantly having to reduce speed when obstructed by the&#13;
slower ones and then having to complete overtaking maneuvers. This simultaneously&#13;
reduces their average speed and increases the changes of a "nose to tail" accident. A by-&#13;
product of this scenario is reduced capacity. The provision of separate "slow vehicle"&#13;
lanes will reduce this type of problem and therefore reduce accidents of the type described&#13;
whilst at the same time increasing capacity.&#13;
44.          Since many users of NR 320 do not have a license to drive a motor vehicle,&#13;
except perhaps agricultural tractors, they have limited experience/knowledge of the&#13;
mechanical and dynamic characteristics of cars and trucks, and cannot appreciate the&#13;
stopping distances required by these vehicles. Indeed the fact that rapid growth of traffic&#13;
has only occurred in recent years has meant the many pedestrians, until recent times, have&#13;
had little experience of interacting with vehicles. It is therefore necessary to enforce the&#13;
segregation described above, which can be achieved in two ways.&#13;
45.          Firstly, use of the main carriageway by slow moving traffic such as tractors,&#13;
cycles and pedestrians needs to be prohibited. Since the Traffic Police have limited&#13;
resources for enforcement, it is unlikely that this action alone would be effective. A&#13;
second way of restricting use of the main carriageway is by encouraging/designing for self-&#13;
enforcement. It is physically difficult to lift a typical Chinese cycle 0.5 m off the ground&#13;
to gain access to the main carriageway; similarly, it is virtually impossible to drive or lift&#13;
a tractor up a vertical face of this dimension. While there is a chance that this segregation&#13;
could cause a vehicle leaving the main carriageway to overturn the chances are reduced&#13;
by the 1.5 m horizontal segregation which must be crossed before reaching the 0.5 m drop.&#13;
This situation is a significant improvement on the original arrangements which had only&#13;
0.75 m horizontal segregation before a vertical drop of about 1.5 m at the embankment&#13;
edge.&#13;
46.         Junctions. Junction improvement proposals in the RSP cover 37 major&#13;
highway junctions and 140 minor road junctions and agricultural tracks. Each major&#13;
junction involves the intersection of a classified road with NR 320. The 140 minor&#13;
junctions include some classified and some unclassified roads together with a number of&#13;
junctions with "tractor roads" (i.e., agricultural tracks).&#13;
47.          The initial section for treatment contains 25 junctions, comprising 5&#13;
connections to NR 320, 4 accesses to hotels/factories or gas stations, 13 junctions with&#13;
minor roads and 3 junctions with "tractor roads". The major and minor road junctions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -                       ANNEX 2&#13;
have been designed to maintain the "slow vehicle" lane segregation while allowing all&#13;
turning movements to be made at grade. This has been achieved by the provision of&#13;
heavily channelized designs.&#13;
48.         Bridges and Culverts. The program for the 80 bridges and culverts on NR&#13;
320 is substantial. It consists of widening the bridges/culverts themselves to accommodate&#13;
the new cross-section described above.  Rather than extending or adding separate&#13;
pedestrian/cycle bridges to the sides of an existing structure, as has been done in the past,&#13;
the bridge itself will be widened. The widening will be such that the new cross-section&#13;
can be accommodated. This approach applies to the 80 bridges and culverts, of which two&#13;
bridges will be demolished and reconstructed. Within the initial section for treatment there&#13;
are nine "small" bridges, two "medium" bridges and 44 culverts which will be widened.&#13;
The two medium bridges will be demolished and renewed as they are structurally deficient.&#13;
49.         There are nine bridges which are not going to be widened during the course&#13;
of this program, but where a temporary layout which maintains the segregated "slow&#13;
vehicle" lanes over the bridge deck has been agreed. Although not included under this&#13;
project, ZPHAB intend to widen these bridges using their own funding, as soon as&#13;
possible.&#13;
50.         Proposed Construction Program.  The civil works component of the&#13;
program has been planned in nine sections or subprojects. Review of the scope and design&#13;
of the first section was initiated during appraisal. The subsequent subprojects will be&#13;
prepared and submitted for Bank approval according to the criteria presented in Attachment&#13;
1. The nine sections are tentatively divided into three phases of three sections each. The&#13;
phasing may be modified during project implementation. The ZPHAB designation and&#13;
details are shown below.&#13;

52.           ZPHAB will manage the contracts for the civil works component of the&#13;
RSP. JIHAB will assist ZPHAB by providing design services. Training courses will be&#13;
organized by ZPHAB in conjunction with relevant provincial and central government&#13;
authorities, and the existing Road Safety unit will manage the technical assistance program.&#13;
53.           Environmental and Resettlement Impacts.  Under the Road Safety&#13;
Program (RSP), nine subprojects have been identified for implementation in a phased&#13;
manner over about a three-year period. All subprojects require substantial widening and&#13;
acquisition of new ROW, and could have a potentially adverse impact on environmentally&#13;
sensitive areas such as noise, water pollution and soil erosion during the construction and&#13;
operation phases. An EA was carried out for the RSP (for all nine subprojects) and an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -                       ANNEX 2&#13;
EAP has been prepared based on the findings of the EA. An RAP covering the&#13;
resettlement impact for all nine subprojects has also been prepared. The EAP and RAP&#13;
have been found acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
54.         Procurement/Bidding Procedures. Procurement will be carried out under&#13;
NCB, in full accordance with World Bank procedures. ZPHAB/JHAB will prepare nine&#13;
separate sets of contract documents, one for each of the subprojects. It is expected that&#13;
a minimum of three contractors would bid for each subproject (for a minimum of 27 bids)&#13;
although a larger number of bids is considered likely. It is also possible that some bids&#13;
will be for more than one subproject. There should be no difficulty in getting this number&#13;
of bids since ZPHAB estimate that over 400 contractors would be reached by their normal&#13;
advertising process. There are at least two suitable contractors in each of the 70 counties&#13;
in Zhejiang Province alone. In addition, there are numerous railway and waterway&#13;
contractors who are qualified to bid for this type of work.  Further description of&#13;
procurement methods is provided in Attachment 1.&#13;
H. TEcHNIcAL ASSISTANCE, TRAiNING AND EQuIPMENT SUBCOMPONENTS&#13;
55.           The technical assistance, training and equipment subcomponents have been&#13;
designed to address shortcomings in all three areas identified earlier. A major input is&#13;
related to changing attitudes towards design philosophy and this is to be implemented as&#13;
detailed below. Draft Terms of Reference are included in Attachment 2 to this annex.&#13;
56.         The Technical Assistance package will consist of:&#13;
(a)   The provision of an expert(s) in Microcomputer Accident Analysis systems&#13;
for three staff-months to set up the two systems provided under the&#13;
equipment part of this package. This would include writing a conversion&#13;
program to allow the existing traffic accident data, held by the Traffic&#13;
Police, to be used as data files, and conversion of at least the last three&#13;
years of data for Jiaxing.&#13;
(b)   The provision of one or more experts (6 staff-months) in the field of road&#13;
safety who will examine existing documents and design standards and&#13;
develop a Road Safety Manual which will set out the principles of good road&#13;
safety practice and standard design details specifically oriented towards&#13;
Chinese conditions.&#13;
Typical standard details which could be developed under this section of the RSP include:&#13;
*     Alternative, channelized, junction layouts to reinforce the "priority" rule;&#13;
*     Speed reducing measures at approaches to and through small communities&#13;
along inter-urban routes;&#13;
*     Approaches to narrow bridges;&#13;
*     Approaches to low radius curves;&#13;
*     Acceleration/deceleration lanes at intersections;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -                       ANNEX 2&#13;
*     Special features/facilities to create safer conditions for pedestrians, cyclists,&#13;
main/animal carts e.g., paved shoulders or even separate segregated lanes&#13;
near villages or where high volumes occur;&#13;
*     Periodic Lay-byes for breakdowns/rest-stops for long distance trucks;&#13;
*     Busbays (off-road and tail-to-tail for safety);&#13;
*     Clear markings/signs indicating priority at every major/minor road junction;&#13;
and&#13;
*     Alternative safer arrangements to relocate houses to be moved from the&#13;
right of way.&#13;
(c)   The provision of one or more experts (6 staff-months) in the field of road&#13;
safety who will examine existing highway design practices and procedures&#13;
and devise a Road Safety Audit system and guidelines which will explain&#13;
how to check highway designs to ensure they do not contribute towards the&#13;
occurrence of accidents. A series of checklists will be devised for Chinese&#13;
designers to use in checking road designs. Practical training in application&#13;
of safety audits will also be included to give local engineers experience in&#13;
carrying out safety audits.&#13;
57.         The Training component will comprise:&#13;
(a)   A local three-week Road Safety Course and practical workshop for 20&#13;
engineers.  This will include training on accident analysis and the&#13;
development and design of engineering remedial measures at accident&#13;
blackspots.&#13;
(b)   A three-week overseas study tour for eight staff involved in road safety&#13;
work. Locations visited will include examples of best international road&#13;
safety practice and the tour will include lecture periods or seminars on&#13;
aspects of road safety.&#13;
(c)   Preparation. The training component will require one or more experts to&#13;
prepare training materials to present the training courses in China and to&#13;
arrange the international study tour.&#13;
58.         The Equipment/Software provision under the RSP consists of:&#13;
(a)   Computers/MAAP. The provision of two IBM compatible 486/33 Mhz&#13;
computer systems and MAAP software in both English and possibly in&#13;
Chinese. A laser printer is included with each system for output. One&#13;
system is to be established at the Traffic Police (in exchange for the&#13;
continuing provision of accident data) and the second system will be&#13;
established at the ZPHAB offices for accident blackspot analysis.&#13;
(b)   Traffic Counters. The provision of one automatic classified counting and&#13;
weighing data collection system for installation at a permanent counting&#13;
station on NR 320, complete with hardware and software to provide data&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -                        ANNEX 2&#13;
output. Four sets of temporary count/classifier systems with data capture&#13;
modules, analyzing software and accessories.&#13;
59.         Procurement for the components of technical assistance and training will be&#13;
made under the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by&#13;
the World Bank as Executing Agency." It is anticipated that the contracts for the&#13;
assistance with the Design Manual and the Safety Audit Guidelines will run consecutively&#13;
from the beginning of the civil works while assistance in setting up the accident data&#13;
analysis system and converting the existing data will begin at the same time and run in&#13;
parallel to the Road Safety Manual contract.&#13;
I. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF RSP&#13;
60.         The economic benefits accruing from  the usual (generally low  cost)&#13;
institutionally-based road safety programs are normally easier to justify on accident savings&#13;
alone. However, costs for the physical works associated with this RSP are substantially&#13;
higher than usual due to the need to "rebuild" the existing road to new standards derived&#13;
from an analysis of the accident problems. This is necessary to enable the benefits of&#13;
accident analysis work and for remedial measures to be fully demonstrated.&#13;
61.         The true cost of road accidents in China is very difficult to assess since&#13;
many "hidden" costs, such as hospital construction and medical staff training, are not taken&#13;
into account. The present practice in valuing accident costs is to sum the costs for physical&#13;
repairs to vehicles and property and add in the standard compensation paid by the&#13;
authorities, as appropriate. The resulting figure could reflect, however, a significant&#13;
underestimation of the real economic costs. Because of this, the accident costs used to&#13;
calculate benefits of this project have been based on the most recent comparable estimates&#13;
of the economic cost of accidents made in 1987 as part of the China Road Safety Project&#13;
(Sichuan Pilot Study) and updated, taking into account inflation and per capita income&#13;
growth in the Zhejiang Province. The values used, updated for 1993, are as follows:&#13;
Fatality                        Y 65,600&#13;
Serious injury                  Y 18,160&#13;
Slight injury                   Y 3,400&#13;
Property damage only            Y  1,700&#13;
It was assumed that the unit cost of accidents would continue to grow in line with the&#13;
economy; a conservative 5 percent per year growth was assumed for the analysis.&#13;
62.         Assessment of the proportion of accidents likely to be saved by the&#13;
introduction of these measures is also difficult to assess. No research has been undertaken&#13;
into the potential accident savings from specific remedial measures in China and so an&#13;
estimate has been based on a combination of factors. Similar measures to some of those&#13;
introduced in this scheme typically produce accident savings of 40 percent in western&#13;
countries. However, a major feature of the scheme is the segregation of traffic which&#13;
eliminates the possibility of certain accidents from happening. An overall potential savings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -                       ANNEX 2&#13;
factor of 60 percent has been used. The total net present value of accident savings during&#13;
the project period is likely to be in the order of Y 330 million.&#13;
63.         A major benefit of the measures introduced to improve road safety is an&#13;
increase in capacity. This in itself contributes substantial economic benefits which can be&#13;
added to the safety benefits of the infrastructure program. Thus the overall benefits of this&#13;
infrastructure program are the sum of the vehicle operating cost savings, time savings and&#13;
the safety benefits, and these amply justify this project component as illustrated below:&#13;
Benefit                         Net present value&#13;
(Y million)&#13;
Vehicle operating costs savings                          815&#13;
Time savings                                             131&#13;
Accident savings                                         329&#13;
Total Savings                                   1L275&#13;
Total Cost of Program (present value)                    124&#13;
ERR                                             54.4%&#13;
64.         A more comprehensive economic evaluation for the Road Safety Program,&#13;
including the impact of the program on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway, is provided&#13;
in Chapter 4.&#13;

PROCEDURES FOR PREPARING ROAD SAFETY PROGRAM&#13;
SUBPROJECTS&#13;
1.          All of the subprojects under the RSP would be subject to prior review and&#13;
clearance by the Bank. The RSP comprises investments under nine already-defined&#13;
subprojects. Any changes to the pre-identified list of subprojects will require amendment&#13;
to the Loan Agreement and additional preparatory work to meet Bank lending&#13;
requirements. The criteria for obtaining the Bank's concurrence to finance subprojects&#13;
(many of which have already been satisfied) in the RSP are as follows:&#13;
(a)   an investment and road safety improvement study should be completed and&#13;
found acceptable to the Bank;&#13;
(b)   engineering design should be prepared in accordance with the design&#13;
standards approved by the Bank during appraisal and sound engineering&#13;
practice;&#13;
(c)   proposed procurement procedures should follow Bank guidelines;&#13;
(d)   the summary information on environmental and resettlement impacts and&#13;
actions taken for each subproject (i.e., to mitigate negative environmental&#13;
impacts or to be taken to restore incomes of the population affected by&#13;
resettlement) must be found acceptable to the Bank; and&#13;
(e)   an economic evaluation must be completed for the proposed sections.&#13;
A. SUBPROJECT INFORMATION FOR BANK REVIEW AND&#13;
FOR PROGRESS REPORTING&#13;
2.          The following information should be prepared and made available in order&#13;
to obtain the Bank's no objection for each subproject package and measure the longer-term&#13;
impact of each subproject under the Road Safety Program.&#13;
3.          Investment and Road Safety Improvement Study.  An economic&#13;
evaluation for the RSP has been prepared, and supports the viability of the program as a&#13;
whole. However, the sequencing of works, road safety conditions prior to investment&#13;
(accident characteristics, analysis of blackspots, rate and severity of accidents involving&#13;
non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians), expected impact on accident rates, recent traffic&#13;
counts and enforcement, and other criteria to be agreed with the Bank should be provided&#13;
as part of subproject information for the Bank's review.&#13;

4.          Engineering Design and Layout. The engineering pavement design should&#13;
be prepared according to national standards as deterrr, ied by MOC. A detailed description&#13;
of the design and technical aspects of the works and of construction supervision&#13;
arrangements should be sent to the Bank. The detailed design documentation and technical&#13;
specifications need not be forwarded to the Bank, but should be made available to Bank&#13;
missions on request in the field. The layout of all junctions should be in accordance with&#13;
current best international practice and the road safety conscious design principles embodied&#13;
in the book Towards Safer Roads in Developing Countries. Layout plans for all junction&#13;
types should be forwarded to the Bank.&#13;
5.          Procurement. Bank procurement procedures would be followed for all&#13;
categories of the Road Safety Program. Civil works contracts would be awarded under&#13;
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures using Model Bidding Documents&#13;
approved by the GOC and the Bank. Each contract would be subject to prior review by&#13;
the Bank. Consultant services for construction supervision and training would be procured&#13;
according to "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency" and under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Equipment would be procured in accordance with "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD&#13;
Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995 and as described in para 3.70.&#13;
6.          Environment.  An environmental impact assessment was carried out for&#13;
the RSP and an EAP was developed, and has been found satisfactory to the Bank. If a&#13;
subproject will be substantially changed, an additional environmental analysis should be&#13;
undertaken for the new/revised subproject. The environmental protection measures for&#13;
each subproject should monitored during implementation for progress reporting and&#13;
possible recommendations to improve environmental mitigation in future phases of the pilot&#13;
program&#13;
7.          Land Acquisition and Resettlement . A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)&#13;
covering the entire Road Safety Program has been prepared by the Zhejiang Provincial&#13;
Highway Administration Bureau and submitted to the Bank. This RAP has been found&#13;
acceptable but would undergo minor revisions prior to negotiations based on the technical&#13;
comments made by Bank resettlement experts. This RAP follows the general principles and&#13;
policies adopted for the Zhejiang section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway.&#13;
Implementation of the RAP began in late 1994 and is complete. Beginning June 15, 1995,&#13;
internal and external monitoring reports for the RSP resettlement activities would be&#13;
submitted to the Bank.&#13;
8.          Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration Bureau should, during the&#13;
resettlement monitoring process, collect (or segregate existing) data on resettlement for&#13;
each RSP subproject. This information should be available for progress reporting and for&#13;
later review of the impact of each subproject.&#13;

Attachment 2&#13;
ROAD SAFETY PROGRAM&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL&#13;
ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING&#13;
A. INRODUCTION&#13;
1.          These terms of reference detail the requirements for consultancy services to&#13;
support the Road Safety Program (RSP) associated with the proposed Shanghai-Zhejiang&#13;
Highway Project.&#13;
2.          Road safety is of serious concern for Zhejiang Province, as elsewhere in&#13;
China. The Zhejiang Provincial Communications Department has responsibility for&#13;
highway design and construction, but most of the provincial responsibility for road safety&#13;
lies with Zhejiang's Public Security Bureau.&#13;
3.          On this basis, a Technical Assistance and Training program has been devised&#13;
to increase awareness of safety conscious design within the section of the Provincial&#13;
Communications Department dealing with highway design and provide basic information&#13;
to enable the limited resources for construction work and accident remedial measures to&#13;
be best targeted. Three of the weakest areas have been identified for assistance:&#13;
(a)   Basic accident information and analysis;&#13;
(b)   Provision of Road Safety Manual and Safety Audit System; and&#13;
(c)   Staff training.&#13;
The work has been divided into three areas of activity designed to address specific,&#13;
identified areas of weakness, as described below.&#13;
B. ACCIDENT DATA AND ANALYSIS&#13;
4.          The Public Security Bureau currently collate all reported accidents on a&#13;
computer system based on a standard data base. This type of system does not easily&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-141-                         ANNEX2&#13;
identify developing problems but requires a specific inquiry by a police officer who must&#13;
then interrogate the system, guessing at relevant selection criteria.&#13;
5.          The objective of the proposed support is to install two TRL Microcomputer&#13;
Accident Analysis Package (MAAP) systems. Such systems easily identify developing&#13;
accident blackspots and are very flexible, identifying common factors in accidents at&#13;
specific locations or over wider areas.  Since the Public Security Bureau have&#13;
responsibility for road safety it has been agreed that one system will be installed within the&#13;
Traffic Police Headquarters. Training for the Traffic Police to operate all aspects of the&#13;
accident record and analysis system, including the production of annual reports, is&#13;
included. The Police will make available copies of the accident data on floppy disc to&#13;
ZPCD. The second system is to be installed in the ZPCD offices in Jiaxing for use by&#13;
their engineers in resolving accident blackspots identified by the Traffic Police. The&#13;
specific services include:&#13;
*     specification of accident location system in consultation with the Traffic&#13;
Police and ZPCD Road Safety Unit and oversight of preparation of coded&#13;
network data by the local municipal authorities;&#13;
*     adaptation of the various MAAP computer programs to analyze data from&#13;
the Police accident data collection form;&#13;
*     conversion of existing historic accident data from 1987 onwards to provide&#13;
a base from which to identify current accident blackspots.&#13;
*     installation of Chinese version of the MAAP system onto the computers and&#13;
certification of correct operation;&#13;
*     training of Police trainers and Traffic Police officers in correct completion&#13;
of Police accident data collection form and developing programs with such&#13;
staff for field training throughout Jiaxing prefecture;&#13;
*     training for ZPCD staff on data checking, coding, data entry, editing,&#13;
storage, updating and quality/accuracy control procedures;&#13;
*     training ZPCD staff in data analysis and manipulation; and&#13;
*     review and adjust the system on the basis of early experience, including&#13;
additional training as may be required.&#13;
6.          It is expected that the above will require three staff-months of a consultant&#13;
experienced in the TRL's MAAP computerized accident data storage and analysis system.&#13;
C. RoAD SAFETY MANUAL AND SAFETY AuDrr PRoCEDuRS&#13;
7.          Two documents are required for circulation to all staff concerned with road&#13;
safety and highway design. The first is a "Road Safety Manual" which, following&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -                        ANNEX 2&#13;
examination of existing documents and design standards, will set out safety conscious&#13;
design procedures and standard details.&#13;
8.          The second is a Road Safety Audit Schedule which will comprise a series&#13;
of "check lists" which are to be applied to all highway designs to ensure unsafe features&#13;
are not built into new designs.&#13;
9.          The Road Safety Manual will cover standard details, such as:&#13;
*     Alternative, channelized, junction layouts to reinforce the "priority" rule;&#13;
*     Speed reducing measures at approaches to and through small communities&#13;
along inter-urban routes;&#13;
*     Approaches to narrow bridges;&#13;
*     Approaches to low radius curves;&#13;
*     Acceleration/deceleration lanes at intersections;&#13;
*     Special features/facilities to create safer conditions for pedestrians, cyclists,&#13;
man/animal carts, e.g., paved shoulders or even separate segregated lanes&#13;
near villages or where high volumes occur.&#13;
*     Periodic lay-bys for breakdowns/rest-stops for long distance trucks;&#13;
*     Busbays (off-road and tail-to-tail for safety);&#13;
*     Clear markings/signs indicating priority at every major/minor road junction;&#13;
*     Alternative safer arrangements to relocate houses to be moved from the&#13;
right of way; and&#13;
*     Any other items deemed necessary following the review of documentation.&#13;
This may be achieved through the services of a single consultant or through&#13;
the coordination of two consultants. The implementation schedule will&#13;
comprise six staff-months of consultant services spread over a period of 12&#13;
months with gaps in between the assignments. Assignments will be in the&#13;
order of one month each if two consultants are used, or two months for&#13;
single consultant. During interim periods ZPCD are to prepare any support&#13;
work and drawings as directed by the consultants.&#13;
10.         The Safety Audit Schedule will consist of a series of checklists and&#13;
guidelines which explain how to check highway designs to ensure they do not contribute&#13;
toward the occurrence of accidents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 143 -                       ANNEX 2&#13;
11.         This work is to be provided by a team of at least two consultants. The&#13;
implementation schedule will comprise four staff-months of consultant services to be spread&#13;
over a period of 12 months. Individual consultant assignments will be in the order of one&#13;
month each. During interim periods, ZPCD are to prepare any support work and drawings&#13;
as directed by the consultant.&#13;
D. TRAINNG&#13;
12.         The Duties of the consultant will be to prepare:&#13;
(a)   A local, three-week Road Safety Course and practical workshop for 20&#13;
engineers.  This will include training on accidental analysis and the&#13;
development and design of engineering remedial measures at accident&#13;
blackspots; and&#13;
(b)   A three-week overseas study tour for eight staff involved in road safety&#13;
work. Locations visited will include examples of best international road&#13;
safety practice and the tour will include lecture periods or seminars on&#13;
aspects of road safety.&#13;
13.         The training component will require one or more experts to prepare training&#13;
materials to present the training courses in China and to arrange the international study&#13;
tour. The total consultant time required for the training element is six staff-months.&#13;
14.         Consultant Qualirications. The consultants should have the following&#13;
qualifications for each of the sections as noted below:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 145 -                       ANNEX 3&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND&#13;
ACTION PLAN SUMMARY&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.          Environmental Assessments (Eas) were carried out for the Shanghai and&#13;
Zhejiang sections of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway ("the Expressway") by the&#13;
Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences (SAES) and the Zhejiang Provincial&#13;
Research Institute of Environmental Protection (ZPRIEP) respectively. The Shanghai&#13;
section EA was completed in February 1993 and the Zhejiang section EA was completed&#13;
in October 1992, supplemented in October 1993. They identified social disruption, noise,&#13;
air pollution, water pollution, soil erosion, impacts on irrigation systems, etc. as major&#13;
potential impacts. Based on the findings included in the Eas and subsequent to the&#13;
discussion between the representatives of Shanghai Municipality, Zhejiang Province and&#13;
the Bank staff, the Environmental Action Plans (EAPs) for Shanghai and Zhejiang sections&#13;
were prepared in September 1993 and submitted to the Bank in October 1993. The Eas,&#13;
EA Summaries and EAPs were discussed and further modified as appropriate during the&#13;
appraisal mission in November 1993. The finalized EAPs were submitted to the Bank in&#13;
February 1994 and found to be satisfactory to the Bank. It has been ascertained that the&#13;
Expressway would not affect ecologically sensitive areas and if appropriate measures are&#13;
taken, its construction and operation should have no significant adverse impact on the&#13;
environment.&#13;
2.          The EAPs specified  the measures, organizations and  monitoring&#13;
arrangements required to mitigate the potential adverse effects on the environment during&#13;
the construction and operation of the Expressway. The main measures relate to social&#13;
disruption, noise, air quality including dust, soil erosion and water management, control&#13;
of construction traffic, operation of quarries, and waste disposal. The engineering design&#13;
and technical specifications for the Expressway have incorporated the appropriate measures&#13;
required to be taken for environmental protection.   Appropriate administrative&#13;
arrangements have been identified to ensure the enforcement of such measures during the&#13;
construction and operation of the Expressway. Summaries of the Eas and EAPs are&#13;
presented in this annex and copies of the EA and EAP reports are available in the Project&#13;
File.&#13;
3.          Since most of the works under the Road Safety Program (RSP) would be&#13;
directed to the upgrading of existing facilities, they are not expected to have significant&#13;
impacts on the environment. Nevertheless, in order to fully mitigate potentially adverse&#13;
effects of subprojects, the EA for the RSP was carried out by Environmental Protection&#13;
Institute of Zhejiang Province. The EA report was prepared in March 1994 and submitted&#13;
to the Bank in May 1994. Based on the findings of the EA, an EAP was prepared in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -                      ANNEX 3&#13;
August 1994 and submitted to the Bank in September 1994. They were reviewed by the&#13;
Bank staff and the comments were sent to the borrower for their consideration.&#13;
4.          The process of environmental review involved inputs from various units in&#13;
the region, including environmental bureaus, research institutions and universities. The&#13;
affected groups along the highway, and the people subject to resettlement and land&#13;
acquisition in particular, have been intensively consulted.&#13;
5.          The policy and administrative requirements for environmental assessment of&#13;
development projects in China were followed during preparation and evaluation of the EA,&#13;
as well as the Bank's OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. Major laws and regulations&#13;
applied to the EA for the project include:&#13;
(a)   Environmental Protection Law of PRC;&#13;
(b)   Atmospheric Pollution Abatement Law of PRC;&#13;
(c)   Environmental Noise Control Law of PRC;&#13;
(d)   Water Pollution Control Law of PRC;&#13;
(e)   Land Management Law of PRC;&#13;
(f)   Safety Management Clause of Chemical Hazard;&#13;
(g)   Management Guidelines on Environmental Protection of Construction&#13;
Project, Number 003 (86), issued by the State Environmental Protection&#13;
Bureau (SEPB);&#13;
(h)   Measures for Environmental Protection Management of Transport&#13;
Construction Projects, Number 117 (86), issued by the Ministry of Urban&#13;
and Rural Construction and Environmental Protection; and&#13;
(i)   Measures for Environmental Protection Management of Transport&#13;
Construction Projects, Number 17 (90), issued by MOC.&#13;
6.          The environmental standards applied in the assessment are listed in Appendix&#13;
1 of this Annex.&#13;
7.          The road covered by the EA was the construction of the Shanghai-Hangzhou&#13;
Expressway, a 131 km four-lane divided access-controlled highway, linking Songjiang in&#13;
Shanghai to Pengbu in Hangzhou. It also included the upgrading of local roads to improve&#13;
access to the Expressway. The 29-km section in Shanghai adjoins the existing 20-km&#13;
expressway length between Xinzhuang and Songjiang. The 102-km section in Zhejiang&#13;
would link at Pengbu with the Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway now under construction. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147 -                       ANNEX 3&#13;
EA for the Road Safety Program covered the nine subcomponents comprising upgrading&#13;
of approximately 86 km of National Route 320 in Jiaxing Prefecture.&#13;
B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF SHANGHAI-HANGZHOU ExPRESSWAY&#13;
Baseline Envirommental Description&#13;
8.          Geographic Condition. The alignment of the Expressway is located in the&#13;
Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou river network plain in the north bank of the Qiantangjiang&#13;
River, which is the southern end of the Changjiang delta, featured by flat terrain,&#13;
networked rivers and numerous lakes. The Expressway passes the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-&#13;
Huzhou plan from southwest to northeast with many paddy fields and mulberry hills along&#13;
the alignment, descending at this way with a height of about 6-7 m.&#13;
9.          Hydrological and Meteorological Conditions. The region belongs to&#13;
sub-tropical monsoon climate zone, having moist temperature, demarcated seasons and&#13;
abundant rainfall with the average annual temperature of about 16-17°C, annual average&#13;
humidity of about 80-82 percent and annual precipitation of about 1,000-1,200 mm.&#13;
Occasional typhoons strike in autumn and in summer. The surface runoff goes into the&#13;
river network through channels and finally into the Qiantangiing River and Hangzhou Bay.&#13;
The water system in the region constitutes a water transport network and formulates&#13;
various channels capable for vessel transportation.&#13;
10.         Population and Economy. The region, including Yuhang and Jiashan&#13;
counties as well as Haining, Tongxiang, and Jiaxing cities, has a population of 3.65 million&#13;
along the alignment. The average population density is approximately 600-900 persons per&#13;
km2, rising to 4,000-15,000 in the most crowded areas. About half the economic activity&#13;
of Zhejiang Province is concentrated in the 150-km corridor linking the cities of Hangzhou&#13;
and Shaoxing. In 1990, Zhejiang ranked second in the nation in terms of Gross Output&#13;
Value of Agriculture and Industry (GOVAI). The province as a whole enjoyed a per capita&#13;
GOVAI about 50 percent higher than the national average, and in the Hangzhou-Shaoxing-&#13;
Ningbo corridor, about 150 percent higher. The six counties and cities along the alignment&#13;
have paddy fields of about 200 km2, mixed up with mulberry fields and tea plantations,&#13;
with annual productions of about 2.3 million tons of rice and 1.3 million dan of silkworm&#13;
cocoons, which account for 15 percent and 30 percent of the total production of the&#13;
Province, respectively.&#13;
11.         Ecological Environment. Ecological environment of the areas along the&#13;
alignment is mainly an artificial agricultural system. Major crops are rice, wheat, cotton,&#13;
oil seed, vegetables and fruits.&#13;
12.         Air Quality. In the Zhejiang section, CO, NOx, SO2, Total Suspended&#13;
Particulate (TSP) and Total Hydrocarbons (THC) were measured and analyzed along the&#13;
alignment of selected residential areas, existing road crossings, etc. The results indicated&#13;
that the present air quality is relatively good along the alignment. In the Shanghai section,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -                       ANNEX 3&#13;
six points were selected for ambient air quality monitoring.  Co, NOX, TSP and&#13;
Non-methane Hydrocarbons (NMHC) were measured in December 1992. The results also&#13;
indicated that the present air quality is generally good.&#13;
13.         Noise. The results of selected representative spots such as villages, schools,&#13;
and road crossings showed that average noise levels were 43-51 dB(A) in the daytime and&#13;
32-38 dB(A) at nighttime in the Zhejiang section, and 47-55 dB(A) in the daytime and 42-&#13;
47 dB(A) at nighttime in the Shanghai section. The existing acoustic environment is&#13;
generally good, except the spots near the railway and the existing roads.&#13;
14.         Water Quality. The analysis of the water quality of major rivers and&#13;
cultivation ponds for aquatic products revealed that in some areas the water quality&#13;
standards, in terms of COD and BOD, were exceeded. The pollution was considered to&#13;
be mainly caused by discharge from cultivation ponds and the runoff from agricultural&#13;
fields.&#13;
15.         Cultural/Historic Locations. Hangzhou and Jiaxing are two main historic&#13;
cities along the along the alignment. Pog and Rain Pavilion at South Lake are ranked as&#13;
national key protected cultural relics. Hangzhou is well-known as a tourist center, and will&#13;
further develop its tourist business with the construction of the Shanghai-Hangzhou&#13;
Expressway.&#13;
Potential Environmental Impacts Identified in the EA&#13;
16.         The following key areas of environmental impacts were identified, where&#13;
adverse change may take place during the construction and operation of the highway:&#13;
(a) Air Pollution. The most significant factors contributing to air pollution will&#13;
be dust during the construction phase and vehicular emission during the&#13;
operation phase. Dust in the construction phase is mainly caused by&#13;
transport of construction materials, other earth moving activities, use of&#13;
construction vehicles, and emissions from asphalt plants. In the operation&#13;
phase, the major air pollutant is NOx. According to the predictions in the&#13;
EAs, CO will not exceed the standard at any point in the future. NOx&#13;
concentrations corresponding to daily traffic will meet the standard in all&#13;
road sections until the year 2018. During peak periods of traffic volume,&#13;
NOx will generally meet the standard except during the year 2018. In the&#13;
morning when the air is stable, NOx levels within 40 m from the roadside&#13;
will exceed the standard during the years 2010-2018.&#13;
(b)   Noise. In the construction phase, noise impacts will be significant. The&#13;
sound of blasting mountains and noise of construction machinery will affect&#13;
the lives of local residents, especially at night. According to predictions in&#13;
the EAs, at the beginning of expressway operation in the year 2000, the&#13;
noise levels will not exceed the daytime standard [70 dB(A)] in any sections&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 149 -                       ANNEX 3&#13;
and will not exceed the nighttime standard [55 dB(A)] in most sections.&#13;
The affected areas expand as the traffic volume increases. In 2015, the&#13;
noise levels within 70 m from the roadside will exceed the standard in&#13;
daytime and the affected areas will expand to 150 m from the roadside at&#13;
nighttime.&#13;
(c)   Soil Erosion and Water Quality. The main cause of water loss and soil&#13;
erosion during the construction is that, in the process of earth work, top soil&#13;
may be washed out by the rain water, which results in waterway silting up,&#13;
turbid water, and negative impacts on irrigation ditches. However, serious&#13;
soil erosion will not occur if adequate measures are taken during the design&#13;
and construction phases. Surface water quality will become worse in a short&#13;
period during the construction phase, which can be mitigated by strict&#13;
control measures.&#13;
(d)   Soil Pollution. Soil pollution by lead from motor vehicles could affect&#13;
crops along the highway. According to the field measurement, the lead&#13;
content in mulberry leaves along the roadside is 2-3 times higher than that&#13;
far away from the roadside. However, the present lead level in soil is&#13;
within the background range.&#13;
(e)   Social Disruption. The sub-grade elevates an average height of about 3 m,&#13;
causing social disruption by separating residential areas, farmland etc.,&#13;
unless passageways are designed in an adequate manner. Due to the&#13;
transport of a large quantity of building materials, the traffic volume during&#13;
the construction phase will certainly increase, which could have an adverse&#13;
effects on local communities along the highway.&#13;
(f)   Others.  The probability of accidents may increase but will not be&#13;
significant in the construction phase. The risk of traffic accidents and&#13;
accidents associated with the transport of hazardous materials will increase&#13;
during the operation phase.&#13;
Mitigation Measures&#13;
17.         The EAPs stipulate how the environmental impacts identified in the EAs will&#13;
be dealt with at design, implementation and operation stages, including what administrative&#13;
arrangements have been made for the execution of the EAPs during these three distinct&#13;
phases. Major mitigation measures for Zhejiang and Shanghai sections are highlighted&#13;
below and summarized in Appendix 2 and 3 of this Annex, respectively.&#13;
18.         Selection of Alignment. The proposed alignment (the so-called middle&#13;
route) was selected from among three alternatives, i.e., east, middle and west routes, with&#13;
a view to avoiding large residential areas and ecologically sensitive areas, and minimizing&#13;
resettlement and other adverse impacts on the local population. The alignment was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 150 -                         ANNEX 3&#13;
selected to be away from villages, schools, hospitals, protected areas of cultural relics,&#13;
etc., as much as possible, under the principle of "being away but not far from cities and&#13;
towns."&#13;
19.         Air Pollution. During the construction phase, adequate measures will be&#13;
taken to minimize dust pollution, such as watering, covering of transported construction&#13;
materials, etc. Advanced technology will be adopted for heating asphalt. Asphalt mixing&#13;
sites will be carefully selected to avoid adverse effects on residential areas. During the&#13;
operation phase, public awareness campaigns and education will be undertaken to promote&#13;
compliance with traffic rules and tail gas emission standard. Trees will be planted along&#13;
the roadside, as appropriate, with a view to reducing adverse impacts.&#13;
20.          Noise. During the construction phase, construction work that generates&#13;
significant noise in the vicinity of residential areas will be undertaken during daytime hours&#13;
(6:00-22:00). Transportation of construction materials will be carried out with careful&#13;
consideration to minimizing noise impacts on residents along the roadside. Maintenance&#13;
of construction machines and trucks will be strengthened so as to keep them at low noise&#13;
levels. Traffic management, including dissemination of traffic rules and setting up of&#13;
speed limits, will be strengthened.&#13;
21.          Residences which are located within 20 m from the side ditch of the highway&#13;
and are seriously affected by noise will be resettled progressively. The construction of&#13;
new buildings, including residences, will be prohibited within 50 m from the side ditch.&#13;
Sound screens will be installed at 90 places during the initial operation phase, and&#13;
thereafter, noise barriers will be installed in five areas, and forest belts will be constructed&#13;
in two areas in the Zhejiang section in a phased manner. Additional noise barriers could&#13;
be installed as the need arises and as determined from the results of the monitoring&#13;
program. These measures, with total investment cost of Y 774,000, are summarized in&#13;
Table 1.&#13;
22.          Soil Erosion and Water Quality. Slope protection and drainage facilities&#13;
will be constructed in order to protect soil erosion.  Appropriate measures, either&#13;
rehabilitation or reconstruction, will be taken where the existing irrigation and drainage&#13;
systems are damaged. Appropriate waste water treatment facilities such as septic tanks&#13;
will be installed at construction sites and camp sites. Sludge in sewage purification pits&#13;
will be disposed of periodically. During the operation phase, sewage from service areas&#13;
will be treated appropriately and no waste water will be discharged directly into rivers or&#13;
irrigation canals.&#13;
23.          Soil Pollution. Lead levels will gradually increase in the future as traffic&#13;
volume increases. Since the EA failed to provide prediction of future lead levels along the&#13;
roadside, it is necessary to regularly monitor the lead level in the operation phase, in order&#13;
to safeguard people's health, and to provide a more scientific basis for identifying&#13;
necessary measures regarding road construction projects.&#13;

including 85 pedestrian underpasses, one on average every 50 m) will be constructed to&#13;
meet the requirements of local people and vehicles for crossing the highway.&#13;
25.         Others. The management of transport of hazardous materials will be&#13;
strengthened.  Prior to transportation of hazardous materials, the Public Security&#13;
Department will examine the arrangements and plans for their transport.&#13;
Environmental Monitoring&#13;
26.         During construction and operation of the highway, environmental monitoring&#13;
will be carried out to verify the actual impacts on the environment, identify unexpected&#13;
environmental problems at an early stage, and adjust environmental protection measures&#13;
as appropriate. In the Zhejiang section, the Expressway Environmental Protection Sectors&#13;
(EEPS) of the Zhejiang Provincial Expressway Project Executive Commission (ZPEC) will&#13;
be responsible for environmental monitoring in the construction phase, and the future&#13;
Expressway Administration Department (EAD) and the Environmental Monitoring Station&#13;

vibration, and lead contamination in soil and crops.&#13;
28.         Air Pollution. Periodic monitoring will be carried out during both the&#13;
construction and operation phases. Items to be monitored will include TSP, NOx and CO&#13;
in the construction phase and NOx, CO, TSP and lead in TSP in the operation phase.&#13;
29.         Water Pollution.  Periodic monitoring will be carried out during the&#13;
construction and operation phases. Items to be monitored will include SS and oil, etc., in&#13;
the construction phase and DO, BOD, COD, SS, oil, heavy metals etc., in the operation&#13;
phase.&#13;
30.         Noise and Vibration. Periodic monitoring will be carried out once every&#13;
season both in daytime and at night near construction sites during the construction phase.&#13;
Monitoring will be carried out once every season during the operation phases. Ad hoc&#13;
monitoring will also be undertaken as appropriate.&#13;
31.         Other Items. Lead content in soil and crops will be carried out once a year&#13;
during the construction and operation phases.&#13;
C. ENviRoNMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF ROAD SAFETY PROGRAM&#13;
32.         Major infrastructure components of the Road Safety Program  include&#13;
widening and segregation of different types of traffic in nine sections totaling&#13;
approximately 86 km, improvement of 37 major highway and 140 minor road junctions,&#13;
and upgrading of 80 bridges and culverts along the National Road 320. Major mitigation&#13;
measures for the Road Safety Program are highlighted below and summarized in Appendix&#13;
4 of this Annex.&#13;
33.         Noise. During the construction phase, construction equipment such as piling&#13;
machines and loaders will cause significant noise. Construction work, therefore, will be&#13;
stopped during nighttime (from 20:00 to 6:00) within 150 m from sensitive sites. All&#13;
construction machines will be equipped with proper sound mufflers to reduce noise. In&#13;
order to reduce impact of noise and exhaust gas emissions during the operation phase,&#13;
houses within 20 m of the reconstructed road will be resettled. Construction of new&#13;
residences will be prohibited within 200 m from both sides of the road until 1998 when the&#13;
Expressway becomes accessible. Noise barriers will be installed around the Suburban&#13;
Primary School of Chongfu, Buyuan Middle School of Tongxiang and South Lake Middle&#13;
School of Jiaxing. Vehicles will be requested to equip with sound mufflers. Trees will&#13;
be planted along the road to reduce air and noise pollution.&#13;
34.         Air Pollution. During the construction phase, construction materials such&#13;
as earth, gravel and stones will be piled more than 100 m away from residential areas,&#13;
villages and schools, and will not be piled in the open air. In dry weather, construction&#13;
and piling sites will be watered to control dust (at least 4-5 times a day). Asphalt will be&#13;

heated and mixed in a closed roaster. Asphalt heating factory will be located at least&#13;
100 m away from villages and towns. Asphalt will be mixed in a movable high-&#13;
temperature container without heating source. Trees and turf will be planted to reduce&#13;
impact of exhaust gas emissions and noise. Vehicles are requested to equip with exhaust&#13;
gas purifiers.&#13;
35.         Water Pollution. In the construction phase, to avoid direct discharge of&#13;
waste water from construction sites into rivers, temporary septic tanks will be installed.&#13;
Garbage and other wastes from construction sites will be collected and disposed of in an&#13;
adequate manner. In order to prevent pollution from garages, washing stations etc., such&#13;
facilities along the road will not be located near water bodies.&#13;
36.         Soil Erosion. Measures will be taken to prevent irrigation canals from&#13;
being filled with, or blocked by, construction materials. Excavated areas will be filled and&#13;
pressed tightly as promptly as possible. A sufficient number of escape channels will be&#13;
constructed at construction, disposal and material borrow sites. Trees and turf will be&#13;
planted on road bed slopes, in permanent or temporary filling places, and at disposal sites.&#13;
Top soil will be saved and returned to the excavated areas as much as possible after&#13;
construction works are completed.&#13;
37.         Cultural Relics. The main cultural relics along the National Road 320&#13;
number four-Wuzhen Tomb in Jiashan, the South Lake and Misty Rain Tower (Yan Yu&#13;
Lou) in Jiaxing, Pushu Pavilion in Jiaxing and Loujiagu Remains in Tongxiang. Each site&#13;
is located at least 1.5 km from the road and will not be affected by the Road Safety&#13;
Program.&#13;
38.         Social Disruption.  Detailed construction transportation plans will be&#13;
prepared to avoid transportation of construction materials at peak traffic hours. River&#13;
transport will be used where appropriate to avoid traffic congestion on the road.&#13;
Temporary entrances and exits will be set up at the crossroads to reduce impact on&#13;
passengers and vehicles. In order to enable passengers and local vehicles to cross the&#13;
roads smoothly and safely, 140 crossroads and passages will be constructed.&#13;
39.         Environmental Monitoring. During the construction and operation phases,&#13;
environmental monitoring will be carried out to verify the actual impacts on the&#13;
environment, identify unexpected environmental problems at an early stage, and adjust&#13;
environmental protection measures as appropriate.  Zhejiang Provincial Highway&#13;
Administration Bureau will be responsible for environmental monitoring during both the&#13;
construction and operation phases, and will entrust the work to the municipal&#13;
administrative stations. The key areas of monitoring include air pollution (CO, NOx, TSP,&#13;
dust and THC), noise pollution, and water pollution (pH, BODs, DO, COD, SS and oil).&#13;

- 171 -                       ANNEX 4&#13;
LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.            This annex summarizes the land acquisition and resettlement impacts arising&#13;
from construction of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway (hereafter, "the Expressway") and for&#13;
road expansion and upgrading under the Road Safety Program (hereafter, "RSP"). The annex&#13;
is based on information collected during Bank missions and provided in the Resettlement Action&#13;
Plans (RAPs) prepared by the project implementing agencies (the Shanghai-Hangzhou&#13;
Expressway Construction Executive Commission or "HHEC", and the Zhejiang Provincial&#13;
Expressway Project Executive Commission, or "ZPEC", in Zhejiang). All resettlement activities&#13;
associated with the project are being carried out in accordance with these RAPs.&#13;
2.             The resettlement aspects of the project received considerable attention from the&#13;
Bank beginning in 1993 with the pre-appraisal and appraisal. The extensive preparation that has&#13;
resulted was warranted by the large scale resettlement impact, with more than 55,000 people&#13;
affected by the loss of land, employment, and assets under the project; the implementing&#13;
agencies' limited experience in preparing and implementing RAPs consistent with Bank&#13;
guidelines; and the Bank's increasing awareness and ability to assist the Chinese government&#13;
to address the complex issues related to resettlement.&#13;
3.            The advanced state of preparation of this project, with an estimated start of&#13;
major construction in September 1995, and early stage construction that began in 1994 has&#13;
resulted in implementation of the RAPs prior to Board approval. All resettlement activities in&#13;
Zhejiang Province (hereafter "Zhejiang") have been completed, and resettlement in Shanghai&#13;
Municipality (hereafter "Shanghai") would be carried out during June and July of 1995. The&#13;
early resettlement was implemented in a manner consistent with RAPs that were largely&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank but still under discussion. However, in order to ensure equity and&#13;
consistency of resettlement activities, Shanghai and Zhejiang are applying the principles,&#13;
eligibility criteria, and compensation standards of the final revised RAPs retroactively so that&#13;
all project affected people are resettled according to RAPs found acceptable to the Bank. In&#13;
Zhejiang, where this retroactive provision is relevant, all retroactive compensation will be paid&#13;
before the end of July 1995. In Shanghai, resettlement would be consistent with the final revised&#13;
RAP, so that the retroactive provision would not apply.&#13;
4.            Land acquisition and resettlement activities along the Pengbu-Wengmei advance&#13;
contracting section in Zhejiang were completed between October 1993 and April 1994. In order&#13;
to ensure that the land acquisition and resettlement for this section was carried out satisfactorily,&#13;
the Bank requested that an evaluation of the resettlement activities be prepared by an independent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 172 -                        ANNEX 4&#13;
monitoring institution. The resulting report indicated satisfactory completion of relocation&#13;
activities, but cited delays in the process of providing eligible people with employment in&#13;
enterprises. The employment placement process for the Pengbu-Wengmei section was completed&#13;
by November 1994.&#13;
5.             The process and strategies used for resettlement in this advance contracting&#13;
section, and further, early lessons learned from implementation of resettlement in this section&#13;
and under other projects in China, were scrutinized and, in most areas, the approach to&#13;
resettlement strengthened as reflected in the final, revised RAPs for all project components.&#13;
Initially, the Bank's concerns about the large number of people affected by this project and the&#13;
limited previous experience with formulating RAPs warranted more intensive preparation of the&#13;
project's resettlement activities. In response to this concern, both Shanghai and Zhejiang, with&#13;
the assistance of specialized agencies, initiated a socio-economic survey of the project area in&#13;
late 1994 to: (a) verify the results of the earlier census surveys and (b) establish a baseline of&#13;
income levels and socio-economic conditions (including assets held) of the affected population.&#13;
The detailed data from socio-economic surveys became the basis for the final revised RAPs.&#13;
6.             During further preparation of the RAPs and in consultation with the Bank's&#13;
technical experts, other critical aspects of the resettlement process were addressed, including:&#13;
(a) the establishment of a policy framework to ensure that living standards all categories of&#13;
affected people are, at a minimum, restored; (b) the establishment of transparent mechanisms&#13;
to redress grievances of affected people and the procedure for appeals; (c) the necessity to&#13;
compensate all affected assets, and housing in particular, at full replacement values; (d) the&#13;
inclusion of contingencies, especially for inflation, in resettlement budgets; (e) the strengthening&#13;
of institutional arrangements for both internal and external monitoring of land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement activities; and (f) the planning and execution of detailed processes of job creation.&#13;
7.             All the above issues have been addressed in the RAPs prepared by Shanghai&#13;
and Zhejiang. Regarding the development of a RAP for the Road Safety Program, Zhejiang&#13;
authorities conveyed to the Bank that they would prepare the RAP covering all the sections of&#13;
the component as opposed to preparing a Phase I RAP for the project as a whole before project&#13;
approval and preparing separate Phase II RAPs for each of the specific sections before their&#13;
respective implementation. Zhejiang has accordingly submitted a RAP covering all the sections&#13;
to the Bank in May, 1995. This RAP has been found to be acceptable.&#13;
B. PRINCIPLES OF RESETruMENT&#13;
8.             In China, national, provincial, and municipal government principles guide the&#13;
process of resettlement, requiring that the incomes and standard of living of affected people are&#13;
restored or improved as soon as possible after the initial disruption caused by land acquisition.&#13;
These principles seek to (a) relocate houses and enterprises as close as possible to their initial&#13;
location; (b) maintain or improve the housing quality and size; (c) replace farm land through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 173 -                       ANNEX 4&#13;
readjustment in the same village; and (d) arrange for jobs in nearby enterprises when farm land&#13;
cannot be replaced. These principles provide the basis for all RAPs in the proposed project.&#13;
Because of the pace of urban development in greater Shanghai, all surplus labor in Shanghai&#13;
section (the surplus labor is defined as the number of persons above the accepted labor to land&#13;
ratio for the affected village) will be resettled in new and existing enterprises.&#13;
C. PoIucY FRAMEWORK AND LEGAL PROVLgONS&#13;
The national regulations governing resettlement issues are as follows:&#13;
(a)   The Land Administration Law of the People's Republic of China for Land Acquisition&#13;
and Resettlement;&#13;
(b)   Regulations for Implementation of Land Administration of the People's Republic of&#13;
China;&#13;
The additional specific regulations governing resettlement in Shanghai Municipality are:&#13;
(a)   Administration Measures for Shanghai Land Construction;&#13;
(b)   Compensation standards and stipulations of various bureaus of Shanghai Municipal&#13;
Government; and&#13;
(c)   Administration Enforcement Regulations of Urban House Removal in Shanghai&#13;
Municipality.&#13;
The additional specific regulations governing resettlement issues in Zhejiang Province are:&#13;
(a)   Measures for Implementation of Land Administration of Zhejiang Province; and&#13;
(b)   City and county government stipulations for land acquisition and compensation&#13;
standards.&#13;
D. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REPORTING&#13;
9.            Both internal and external monitoring units will be responsible for reporting and&#13;
analyzing the status of resettlement at all levels in order to facilitate timely and proper&#13;
distribution of compensation funds, and appropriate relocation and resettlement of affected&#13;
people. The scope of monitoring includes surveys and analyses based on completed land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement. The implementation of the Shanghai RAP will be monitored&#13;
internally by HHEC and externally by the Shanghai Federation of Social Sciences. The Urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 174 -                       ANNEX 4&#13;
and Rural Planning and Design Institute of Hangzhou University has been engaged by ZPEC&#13;
both for conducting baseline surveys and for independent monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
resettlement These agencies were originally retained to conduct socio-economic surveys and will&#13;
continue their involvement in the resettlement issues.&#13;
10.           The monitoring is designed to examine and monitor progress in implementation&#13;
of the RAPs, paying particular attention to the timeliness and adequacy of compensation funds,&#13;
proper relocation of resettlers, delivery of specified entitlement (including jobs and provisions&#13;
for meeting the needs of vulnerable people) to eligible resettlers, and the adequacy of measures&#13;
to restore the standards of living of the affected people. The independent monitoring institutions&#13;
will conduct surveys to determine the degree of success in meeting the objectives of the RAPs,&#13;
and will report their findings in writing to the HHEC, ZPEC, and ZPHAB, recommending&#13;
specific actions when warranted.&#13;
11.           A schedule for resettlement monitoring and reporting has been developed based&#13;
on the implementation schedules for land acquisition and resettlement, and has been agreed&#13;
between Shanghai and Zhejiang and the Bank. The first monitoring report on the Pengbu-&#13;
Wengmei section submitted to the Bank in September 1994, reported satisfactory completion of&#13;
new houses for all affected persons, but noted that job creation needed to be expedited. Future&#13;
monitoring reports will focus on the progress made in providing jobs to the eligible affected&#13;
persons. Monitoring reports covering the recently completed resettlement activities in Zhejiang&#13;
Province are under preparation; the first internal monitoring reports were submitted to the Bank&#13;
on June 15, 1995, and the first independent monitoring reports would be submitted to the Bank&#13;
by July 15, 1995. For resettlement activities in Shanghai, the first internal and independent&#13;
monitoring reports would be submitted to the Bank by July 15, 1995 and September 1, 1995,&#13;
respectively. After the initial reports, internal monitoring reports would be prepared and&#13;
submitted to the Bank every 3 months, and independent monitoring reports would be prepared&#13;
and submitted to the Bank every 6 months.&#13;
E. IMPACT OF THE PROJECT iN SHANGHAI&#13;
12.           Route Description.  The Shanghai segment of the Shanghai-Hangzhou&#13;
expressway will extend from Songjiang to Fengjing, covering a distance of 27.6 km out of a&#13;
total expressway length of 130.2 km. Resettlement will be necessary for the population residing&#13;
in 29 villages of 7 townships, located in the counties of Songjiang and Jin Shan. Efforts have&#13;
been made to minimize resettlement while designing the alignment.&#13;
13.           Assessment of Impact on Local Population. During the initial stages of&#13;
project development, the highway planning and design institute carried out the census surveys&#13;
of the affected people and properties. The Shanghai Federation of Social Science Societies&#13;
conducted a socioeconomic survey of the people and enterprises affected by land acquisition and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 175 -                       ANNEX 4&#13;
resettlement, during October and November 1994. The socioeconomic survey report is available&#13;
in the project files.&#13;
14.           The expressway will require permanent acquisition of about 2,862 mu of land,&#13;
including land necessary for the reconstruction of houses and enterprises. An additional 529 mu&#13;
will be borrowed for temporary use during the construction phase. Virtually all of the land&#13;
required for the right-of-way (ROW) is cultivated or in economic use, as is generally true in&#13;
China. However, the land required for this project constitutes less than 0.5 percent of the&#13;
cultivated land in the two affected counties of Shanghai. Around 141 houses will need to be&#13;
relocated.&#13;
15.           An estimated 4,260 people will be directly affected by permanent land&#13;
acquisition for the main expressway and interchanges in Shanghai, comprising 2,823 people&#13;
affected by land acquisition, of whom, 1,814 people will be affected by the acquisition of farm&#13;
land, 604 people will be affected by house demolition (affecting 141 houses), and 833 people&#13;
will be affected by relocation of enterprises.&#13;
F. STRATEGIES FOR RESETLEMENT IN SHANGHAI&#13;
16.           The majority of individuals losing residences in Shanghai will be relocated&#13;
within their village. New sites have been selected by the local township and county land&#13;
departments, with the assistance of the villages. The distance between the original house and&#13;
the new house will not normally exceed 500 meters. The local government intends to construct&#13;
replacement housing; households will, however, have the option of making their own&#13;
arrangements for new housing. The local county governments will finalize transition period&#13;
arrangements for temporary housing during the period between demolition and construction of&#13;
replacement housing.  Y 1,200 per household will be provided for that purpose.  The&#13;
compensation budget for house demolition is Y 9.7 million.&#13;
17.           Enterprises to be demolished are being relocated in the vicinity of their original&#13;
sites, and workers affected by enterprise relocation retain jobs in the same enterprises.&#13;
Compensation amounts are decided by negotiation and are equal to the replacement value of&#13;
assets lost.  Enterprises are compensated for site purchase, removal and installation of&#13;
equipment. Demolition and reconstruction are the responsibility of the managing units. The&#13;
compensation budget for enterprise relocation is Y 4.62 million. The compensation budget&#13;
includes a provision for the payment of salaries during the period when work is stopped due to&#13;
relocation.&#13;
18.           People whose livelihood is affected by the loss of agricultural land are being&#13;
resettled by local governments. A portion of their total compensation assessed for crops and&#13;
trees is paid directly to the affected population. Since the local government is responsible for&#13;
resettling the affected people, the major part of the compensation as land compensation fees and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 176 -                       ANNEX 4&#13;
resettlement subsidy goes to township or village governments. The compensation received by&#13;
the village and/or township governments is used collectively to develop villages-through, e.g.,&#13;
land reorganization-and establishing or expanding village or township enterprises. Local village&#13;
committees are expected to plan the investment of compensation monies in consultation with&#13;
their township government.&#13;
19.           The resettlement of farners in the Shanghai section will be accomplished&#13;
entirely through transfer to nonagricultural employment. The surplus labor will largely be&#13;
absorbed by existing township and village enterprises; however, a sizeable number of workers&#13;
will also be employed by new rural enterprises.&#13;
20.           Elderly persons (defined as males who are over 55 and females who are over&#13;
45 years of age and who have only a few years of education) the RAP provides for payment of&#13;
an old age pension at the current standard rate of Y 170 per month. The rate for old age&#13;
pension may be increased in future. The Shanghai authorities have agreed to consider the option&#13;
of using project contributions to the pension fund (Y 36,000 to 48,000 per person) to finance&#13;
self-employment for the more active among these older persons.  The compensation for&#13;
permanent land acquisition is nearly Y 119 million. This includes resettlement subsidies to be&#13;
paid to enterprises that agree to create jobs for resettlers. There is also a provision for payment&#13;
of a monthly unemployment stipend of Y 170 per person per month, until the time a job is&#13;
found.&#13;
21.           Temporary land acquisition (land borrowing) will affect nearly 529 mu of land.&#13;
Affected farmers will receive payments for lost crops from the township government, and the&#13;
land will be returned to the farmer by the contractor in the same condition as before. The&#13;
compensation budget for this item is Y 3.8 million.&#13;
22.           Compensation for all other assets includes payments for relocating tombs,&#13;
village irrigation systems, etc. In addition, the managing units of affected telecommunications&#13;
facilities and power lines are to be paid compensation for relocation.&#13;
G. COMPENSATION STANDARDS AND BUDGET IN SHANGHAI&#13;
23.           Compensation Standards. In accordance with the relevant policies and&#13;
regulations, compensation standards have been determined according to the following&#13;
categories: (1) land acquisition compensation; (2) compensation for relocation of houses and&#13;
enterprises; (3) compensation for relocation of infrastructure; and (4) compensation for&#13;
temporary land borrowing. A summary of compensation by category is shown below.&#13;
24.           Compensation Budget. The RAP provides cost estimates for the various&#13;
categories of expenditures related to land acquisition and resettlement. The cost estimates&#13;
include contingencies calculated at 2 percent of the total amount of compensation and provides&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 177 -                       ANNEX 4&#13;
10 percent allowance for inflation and risk. A provision for administrative costs equivalent to&#13;
two to three percent of total land acquisition and resettlement compensation has been established.&#13;
Contingencies of two percent of total compensation and labor resettlement expenses have also&#13;
been reserved in the overall budget.&#13;

H. IPLEMENTATION OF SEIANGHAI RAP&#13;
25.           The HHEC, on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Government, is responsible&#13;
for implementing the RAP in a manner that ensures timely restoration of incomes and the&#13;
standards of living of the affected people.  Consequently, HHEC is responsible for&#13;
implementation, and monitoring of land acquisition and resettlement activities, coordinating,&#13;
negotiating agreements on resettlement with the other levels of government and allocating the&#13;
compensation budget.&#13;
26.           Responsibilities for resettlement at lower levels of Shanghai government are&#13;
divided as follows:&#13;
(a)   County Level. Songjiang and Jin Shan Counties assume the responsibility to arrange,&#13;
coordinate and supervise land acquisition and resettlement activities within the&#13;
framework of the RAP approved by the Municipal Government. The RAP, together&#13;
with municipal city agreements, direct counties to: undertake land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement for the expressway and access roads; fix compensation standards; give&#13;
directions to townships for agreements with affected population; and disburse&#13;
compensation funds to towns and townships.&#13;
(c)   Town or Township Level. The township level governments assume responsibility on&#13;
behalf of the county to: arrange, execute, and coordinate land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement activities; carry out land and relocation surveys; make compensation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 178 -                       ANNEX 4&#13;
payments to affected individuals, enterprises, and villages; make arrangements for&#13;
rehabilitation of surplus labor; and rehabilitate civic infrastructure.&#13;
27.           Resettlement offices have been established in the affected counties and&#13;
townships. Each affected village has also assigned two to three persons from the village&#13;
committee to be responsible for land acquisition and relocation activities.&#13;
28.           Implementation Schedule. A timetable for resettlement activities in Shanghai&#13;
is provided below. During project preparation, Shanghai authorities confirmed that the schedule&#13;
for compensation and demolition of houses is designed to allow completion of replacement&#13;
housing before or just after demolition of houses. In the latter event, adequate transition&#13;
arrangements will be made for the affected persons: a sum of Y 1,200 per person has been&#13;
allocated for this purpose.&#13;

I. IMPACT OF THE PROJECT IN ZHEJIANG&#13;
29.           Route Description. The Zhejiang segment of the expressway will extend from&#13;
Pengbu (near Hangzhou) to Fengjing (on the border with Shanghai Municipality), covering a&#13;
distance of 103 km. Resettlement will be necessary for the population residing in 106 villages&#13;
of 24 townships, located in Yuhang and Jiashan counties and the county-level cities of&#13;
Hangzhou, Haining, Tongxiang, and Jiaxing along the route. Efforts have been made to&#13;
minimize resettlement while designing the alignment. Advance construction of the Pengbu-&#13;
Wengmei section adjoining Hangzhou began in late February 1994.  In mid-1994, an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 179 -                       ANNEX 4&#13;
independent monitoring and evaluation agency reviewed the resettlement. The independent&#13;
monitoring report confirmed that the physical relocation and construction of new houses had&#13;
been satisfactorily completed. However, the report recommended that the process of providing&#13;
jobs to eligible persons be accelerated. Resettlement of the population affected by the RSP&#13;
component has largely been completed according to the principles set out in the RAP.&#13;
30.           Assessment of the Impact on Local Population. The Rural and Urban&#13;
Planning and Design Institute of Hangzhou University conducted a socioeconomic survey of the&#13;
persons, properties and enterprises to be affected by land acquisition and relocation in the&#13;
Zhejiang section during October and November 1994. The detailed survey report is available&#13;
in project files. A total of 11,108 mu of land has been permanently acquired for the expressway&#13;
ROW in Zhejiang Province. Over 2,361 mu has been acquired temporarily for use during the&#13;
construction phase. Virtually all of the land required for ROW is cultivated or in economic use,&#13;
as is generally true in China. However, this constitutes less than 1.5 percent of the cultivated&#13;
land in Zhejiang Province. In August 1994, the demolition of the 1,436 houses and relocation&#13;
of affected households began. For the RSP component, 1618 mu of land has been permanently&#13;
acquired, resulting in about 0.3% reduction of cultivated land in the affected area.&#13;
31.           The population affected by the permanent acquisition of land for the expressway&#13;
construction-including all persons living in houses to be relocated and workers in relocated&#13;
enterprises-is 38,047 persons. Of these, 5,138 people are affected by house relocation; 740&#13;
are affected due to enterprises relocation and 6,425 people need to be economically rehabilitated&#13;
(have their incomes restored). Of these, about 308 persons will be affected only by house&#13;
demolition; and 31,861 persons will be affected by land acquisition only. The need for economic&#13;
rehabilitation of local groups is determined based on a maximum allowable ratio of labor to&#13;
cultivated land, as governed by public policy. About 14,000 people are affected by the&#13;
permanent land acquisition for the RSP. Of these, 384 people are affected by the loss of house&#13;
only and 786 are affected by relocation of houses and enterprises.&#13;
J. STRATEGIES FOR REsETmLEMENT IN ZHEJIANG&#13;
32.           The majority of individuals losing residences are being relocated within their&#13;
village, with compensation set at "full replacement cost" in order to ensure that housing&#13;
standards are maintained. House owners are responsible for the demolition of their property as&#13;
well as any reconstruction involving the scrap materials. Sites for rebuilding the houses were&#13;
finalized and compensation for houses paid to the affected families before they were required&#13;
to move from their original houses. The compensation budget for house demolition is Y 92.18&#13;
million for the expressway component, and Y 12.23 million for the RSP component including&#13;
a provision for mitigating the hardship caused by demolition in advance of completion of&#13;
replacement housing.&#13;

33.           Enterprises to be demolished are compensated for site purchase, removal and&#13;
installation of equipment, building, demolition and relocation and for the losses resulting from&#13;
stopping of production. All workers affected by relocation of enterprises will remain employed&#13;
in the same enterprises.  Sites for relocation of affected enterprises were finalized after&#13;
consultation with the management of the affected enterprises and in accordance with the&#13;
development plans of the respective townships and villages. The compensation budget is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-181-                         ANNEX 4&#13;
Y 26.21 million for the expressway component, and Y 2.41 million for the RSP component,&#13;
including a provision for the compensation of work interruption.&#13;
34.           People whose livelihood is affected by the loss of agricultural land are being&#13;
rehabilitated through land redistribution (provision of new land) or employment in non-&#13;
agricultural enterprises. Compensation for standing crops and trees was paid directly to the&#13;
affected people. This task, the major share of resettlement compensation (land compensation&#13;
fees and resettlement subsidies) is retained and managed by county, township, or village&#13;
governments. Local village committees and township governments jointly plan the investment&#13;
of these compensation funds. According to Chinese practice, village and township govemments&#13;
play an important role in resettlement by initiating special development projects, for example,&#13;
involving land reorganization, aquaculture and village and township enterprises.&#13;
35.           Resettlement offarmers was achieved through readjustment and redistribution&#13;
of land to the extent feasible. Where this was not possible, remaining laborers are securing jobs&#13;
in state and collective enterprises or have elected the option of cash compensation for self&#13;
employment. The majority of the economically active population affected by permanent land&#13;
acquisition will remain primarily engaged in agriculture, after readjustment of land. A total of&#13;
3,374 enterprise jobs was required to resettle full-time farmers in areas of the route where&#13;
urbanization has substantially reduced farm land, such as Hangzhou City and Yuhang County&#13;
(in the Pengbu-Wengmei section). The compensation for permanent land acquisition is over&#13;
Y 125 million for the expressway component, and Y 14.5 million for the RSP component. This&#13;
includes resettlement subsidies to be paid to enterprises that agree to create jobs for resettlers.&#13;
36.           Provisions have been made for elderly unskilled people considered unsuitable&#13;
for enterprise jobs. They are being paid an old-age pension of about Y 100 per month.&#13;
37.           Farmers affected by temporary land acquisition (land borrowing) will be paid&#13;
compensation for lost crops and for the loss of production for the duration of the temporary land&#13;
borrowing, and their land will be returned to them by the contractor in its original condition.&#13;
38.            Compensation for other assets includes payments for relocating tombs. In&#13;
addition, the managing units of affected schools, telecommunications and power lines were paid&#13;
compensation for relocation of their facilities and assets.&#13;
K. COMPENSATION STANDARDS AND BUDGET IN ZHEJIANG&#13;
39.            Compensation Standards.  In accordance with the relevant policies and&#13;
regulations, compensation standards have been developed for the following categories:&#13;
(1)   land requisition;&#13;

Includes survey, monitoring and evaluation costs and other allowances&#13;
40.             Compensation Budget.  The RAP provides cost estimates for the various&#13;
categories of expenses related to land acquisition and resettlement. Special provisions has been&#13;
made for contingencies at the rate of 5 percent of total land acquisition and resettlement cost,&#13;
in order to meet any unforeseen expenses. Areas differ in the compensation per unit of land and&#13;
per household because of urban land values, productivity differences due to cropping patterns,&#13;
quality of soils, etc.&#13;
L. IMPLEMENTATION OF ZHEJIANG RAP&#13;
41.             ZPEC, on behalf of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, is responsible for&#13;
overall implementation of resettlement plans, and specifically for the timely restoration of living&#13;
standards and income.  Consequently, ZPEC  is involved in negotiating agreements on&#13;
resettlement with the various levels of government, allocating the compensation budget, and&#13;
coordinating the implementation and monitoring of land acquisition and resettlement activities.&#13;
It has also the responsibility to implementation and monitoring of land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement activities. The corresponding institutional responsibility for the RSP is with the&#13;
ZPHAB.&#13;

42.             Responsibilities for resettlement at lower levels of Zhejiang government are&#13;
divided as follows:&#13;
(a)    City Level. The cities of Hangzhou and Jiaxing assume responsibility to arrange,&#13;
coordinate and supervise land acquisition and resettlement activities within the&#13;
framework of the RAP approved by the provincial government.&#13;
(b)    County Level. The RAP and city agreements provide the direction for the counties&#13;
to: undertake land acquisition and resettlement for the expressway and access roads;&#13;
fix compensation standards; direct townships in formatting agreements with the&#13;
affected population; and allocate compensation funds to towns and townships.&#13;
(c)    Town or Township Level. Township, on behalf of the county authorities, arrange,&#13;
execute, and coordinate resettlement activities, undertake land and relocation surveys,&#13;
and make compensation payments to affected individuals, enterprises, and villages.&#13;
43.             Resettlement offices have been established in the affected cities, counties and&#13;
townships. Each affected village will also assign 2-3 persons to be responsible for land&#13;
acquisition and relocation activities. Administrative costs were equivalent to 2 percent of the&#13;
estimated costs of land acquisition and resettlement. A contingency fund equivalent to 5 percent&#13;
of compensation plus administrative costs has been established.&#13;
44.             Implementation  of Resettlement for the  Pengbu-Wengmei Section.&#13;
Construction of the Pengbu-Wengmei section began in February 1994. Compensation to affected&#13;
persons was paid during the period October 1993 to January 1994. Structures were demolished&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 184 -                        ANNEX 4&#13;
about three months after payment of the first installment (between February and April 1994).&#13;
Construction of new houses was completed in August 1994. The compensation for house&#13;
relocation included a hardship allowance for the period between house demolition and completion&#13;
of new housing. Farm land was acquired between October and December, 1993; compensation&#13;
to local government and farmers was paid during the same period. Acquisition of and&#13;
compensation for borrowed land was completed between January and March, 1994. The process&#13;
of resettling surplus labor into enterprises is complete.&#13;
45.           Implementation of Resettlement for the Wengmei-Fengjing Section. Land&#13;
acquisition and demolition of structures was carried out between September 1994 and February&#13;
1995. The major part of compensation payments were made by December, 1994. Readjustment&#13;
of land and resettlement of surplus labor has been completed.&#13;
46.           Implementation of Resettlement for the Road Safety Program.  Land&#13;
acquisition, demolition and reconstruction have been carried out between September 1994 and&#13;
April 1995.  The major part of compensation payments were made in October 1994.&#13;
Readjustment of land and resettlement of surplus labor has been completed.&#13;

PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
1.    This annex summarizes the estimated project cost and financing arrangements for the&#13;
project. The costs were estimated on appraisal in November 1993, and updated after devaluation&#13;
of the yuan in 1994. The following inflation rates were assumed:&#13;
Foreign        Local&#13;
1994          3.00%         25.00%&#13;
1995          6.90%         14.00%&#13;
1996          2.00%         10.50%&#13;
1997          1.60%         8.50%&#13;
1998          2.10%         7.00%&#13;
1999          2.40%         6.50%&#13;
2000          2.20%          6.20%&#13;
2001          2.50%         6.20%&#13;
2.    The assumed exchange rate is Y 8.5 per dollar (the effective exchange rate as of January&#13;
1995). Taxes and duties applicable to civil works and goods were included in the cost estimates.&#13;
The project entities in Shanghai and Zhejiang have included such taxes in their own cost&#13;
estimates and made provision for these costs.&#13;
3.    Taxes and duties on equipment and works have been included in the cost estimates. The&#13;
taxes and duties on equipment comprise import duties at an average rate of 14.5% of CIF price&#13;
for equipment to be procured in Shanghai, and 20% for equipment to be procured in Zhejiang.&#13;
Value-added taxes would also apply to equipment purchases, at a rate of 17% of the local price&#13;
of equipment in both provinces. Taxes on civil works were estimated at 3.5 % of base cost. The&#13;
IBRD loan would not be used to finance taxes and duties.&#13;

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
1.          This annex sets forth the major actions required for implementation of the&#13;
project and description of the key agencies for implementation. For the Shanghai-&#13;
Hangzhou Expressway component, the annex describes: implementing agencies (pages 1-&#13;
3); implementation schedule (page 4); construction supervision arrangements (page 3);&#13;
and procurement processes (pages 5-6). For the Road Safety Program component, the&#13;
annex addresses organizational arrangements (page 7) and implementation schedule (page&#13;
8).&#13;
2.          The annex also includes a schedule for resettlement monitoring (page 9) and&#13;
a listing of project performance monitoring indicators to be used during project&#13;
implementation (pages 9-13).&#13;
Implementation of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway Component&#13;
3.          Implementing Agencies. The Shanghai section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou&#13;
Expressway (hereafter, "the Expressway") would be implemented by the Shanghai&#13;
Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway Construction Executive Commission ("Hu Hang"&#13;
Expressway Commission or HHEC). Six divisions would be established in HHEC for&#13;
project implementation: chief engineer, project management (comprising two units&#13;
responsible for quality, progress, and investment for the duration of the project),&#13;
preliminary phase (project formulation, planning design, and land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement), financial management, material resources (coordination with contractors),&#13;
and public affairs.&#13;
4.          The HHEC  reports directly to the Shanghai Highway Management&#13;
Department and to the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Administration Bureau (SMEAB):&#13;
these planning and financial staff of these agencies were directly involved in the&#13;
preliminary phases of project development. The staff of HHEC were drawn from these&#13;
municipal agencies and from technical institutions in Shanghai. The HHEC was formally&#13;
established by the end of May 1994, and is expected to achieve its total staff complement&#13;
of 45 by July 1995.&#13;
5.          The Zhejiang section of the Expressway would be implemented by the&#13;
Zhejiang Provincial Expressway Construction Executive Commission (ZPEC), the same&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 194 -                       ANNEX 6&#13;
agency that is implementing the Bank-financed Zhejiang Provincial Highway Project (with&#13;
construction of the Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway as the primary infrastructure&#13;
component). Implementation of the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Project (hereafter, "the&#13;
ongoing project") is currently satisfactory, but in 1994 there were implementation&#13;
difficulties resulting from serious construction quality problems and non-compliance with&#13;
the required submission of a plan for monitoring the socio-economic impact of&#13;
resettlement.&#13;
6.          A technical committee was convened by Zhejiang Province to address the&#13;
project performance and quality problems for the ongoing project.  The committee&#13;
determined that a major cause of quality problems was ZPEC's decision in September 1993&#13;
to sign contracts with local governments of six cities and counties along the alignment,&#13;
delegating some of its authority and responsibility for construction.  The resulting&#13;
supervision organization has been found weak and ineffective due to lack of competent&#13;
technical personnel, and the progress and performance of some civil works contracts has&#13;
suffered, with poor quality that is particularly evident on stone/soil embankments. The&#13;
committee also concluded that the contractor's internal quality control system was not&#13;
working.&#13;
7.          The recommendations of the technical committee related to contractor&#13;
performance included that: Zhejiang withhold payments until rejected work is corrected;&#13;
the resident engineer's position to be filled immediately with a more qualified highway&#13;
engineer; contractors strengthen their internal quality control system and replace staff;&#13;
contractors intervene to stop substandard works; contractors build up equipment and&#13;
manpower at the work sites to accelerate progress of remedial works; and performance&#13;
of quality inspectors should be improved. A review of performance for the ongoing&#13;
project also revealed that a large number of local staff (contractors' staff) did not have&#13;
previous experience in expressway construction.&#13;
8.          Zhejiang authorities have, in response to these findings, taken steps to&#13;
improve construction quality. At the project level, Zhejiang authorities have asked the&#13;
management of contracting firms to strengthen staffing and increase equipment and have&#13;
strengthened project monitoring covering number of staff per contract (planned and actual,&#13;
including senior staff), pace of works, use of materials, and use of equipment. Zhejiang&#13;
authorities have also addressed the supervision weaknesses with contracting firms' senior&#13;
management, central government authorities, and the governor in Zhejiang Province. For&#13;
the Zhejiang section of the Shanghai-Zhejiang Highway Project, Zhejiang Province have&#13;
proposed to recruit experts from domestic supervision firms to strengthen the base of&#13;
related supervision experience.&#13;
9.          The project management arrangements for the Zhejiang expressway section&#13;
of the Shanghai-Zhejiang Highway Project include about 100 local staff, including 20 to&#13;
be based in Hangzhou and 80 to be based in Jiaxing. The Zhejiang supervision team is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 195 -                       ANNEX6&#13;
currently staffed with 20 personnel, who have been involved in supervision of the Pengbu-&#13;
Wengmei (advance contracting) section. A main office for supervision of the Zhejiang&#13;
expressway section would be established in Jiaxing (northern Zhejiang). A core group of&#13;
seven engineers who have been actively involved in project preparation would also work&#13;
on supervision of the Zhejiang expressway section. The staff in Hangzhou would, inter&#13;
alia, be responsible for civil works engineering, accounting, and land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement. Qualified local supervision companies are being retained to provide field&#13;
supervision staff as needed during construction.&#13;
10.         A Joint Supervision Team  (JST) will be formed for supervision of&#13;
expressway construction in both Shanghai and Zhejiang. The team would consist of&#13;
international construction supervision consultants, technical personnel from Shanghai&#13;
Municipality and Zhejiang Province, and experts from domestic technical institutions and&#13;
construction supervision companies.&#13;
11.         The construction supervision team in Shanghai would share office space with&#13;
HHEC but maintain separate operations. The Shanghai supervision organization twelve&#13;
staff, including two chief engineers, one for construction and one for supervision. The&#13;
supervision team in Shanghai would be drawn from staff of the highway division in&#13;
SMEAB, Tongxi University, Shanghai Municipal College, and Shanghia Municipal&#13;
Research Institute. SM intends to establish a construction supervision company, subject&#13;
to approval of MOC, that would become involved in project implementation. The&#13;
company is already functioning, and has been authorized by SMEAB to supervise&#13;
construction of a highway from Shanghai to Nanjing.&#13;
12.         Field supervision in the Shanghai section will be carried out in groups&#13;
headed by four resident engineers; a chief engineer from SMEAB will serve as chief&#13;
supervision engineer. Shanghai's construction supervision department comprises forty&#13;
staff: twelve office staff, plus four resident teams in the field (three eight-person teams&#13;
for civil works, and one four-person team for traffic engineering). Additional staff would&#13;
work on quality control and other specialized tasks (eg. laboratory tasks). A pre-&#13;
construction domestic training tour and lectures are planned for local staff to gain&#13;
experience in supervision.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Shanghai-Zheijiang
            Highway Project are: 1) to increase highway capacity in the
            Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor in order to relieve existing
            congestion and promote economic development; 2) to improve
            road safety in northern Zhejiang; and 3) to develop highway
            sector institutional capability in Shanghai and Zhejiang.
            The project consists of four main components: (1) the
            construction of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway, a 130 km
            divided four-lane access-controlled highway, including
            service facilities and the supply and installation of
            electrical, electronic and mechanical equipment for tolling,
            traffic monitoring, telecommunication and lighting, and the
            upgrading and construction of 56 km of crossroads at
            interchange locations in Zhejiang Province to improve access
            to the new expressway; (2) construction supervision of the
            Shanghai-Hangzhou Expressway; (3), the Road Safety Program,
            a pilot program in northern Zhejiang to improve safety on
            highways in the Shanghai-Hangzhou corridor after opening of
            the new expressway, including: the upgrading of 86km of
            National Route and technical assistance, training, and
            equipment; (4) institutional strengthening of highway
            agencies in Shanghai and Zhejiang, comprising: a) a staff
            training program covering highway planning, management,
            design, construction, and maintenance; and b) strengthening
            of technical capacity through the addition of equipment.
