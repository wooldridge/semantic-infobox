INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Technical Assistance and Capacity Building&#13;
1.1    In general, within the World Bank, technical assistance (or technical cooperation) are&#13;
understood to encompass a broad set of activities, only some of which directly lead to capacity&#13;
building. Specifically, technical assistance is defined in Operational Directive 8.40 as the transfer,&#13;
adaptation, mobilization and utilization of services, skills, knowledge, technology and engineering&#13;
to:  (a) carry out policy studies and provide advice; (b) support project preparation and&#13;
implementation; and (c) enhance a developing country's human, economic, technical, analytical,&#13;
managerial and institutional capabilities on a sustainable basis. Only activities undertaken under&#13;
item (c) above are considered as capacity building or, as an alternative definition, institutional&#13;
development.&#13;
1.2    The important aspect of the definition is the demarcation between provision of support for&#13;
addressing immediate needs (whether policy or project based) and the focus on the long-run&#13;
objective of increasing a country's ability or capacity (i.e. intellectual infrastructure, systems,&#13;
procedures, etc.). In designing the proposed Institutional Capacity Building Project, emphasis has&#13;
been given as far as possible to the latter set of activities. The focus of capacity building activities&#13;
under the proposed project are further narrowed to: (a) those tasks which have been demarcated&#13;
as most critical to supporting the key areas of Government's reform agenda (i.e. civil service&#13;
reform, decentralization and private sector development); and (b) only cross-sectoral tasks have&#13;
been included with sector specific capacity building activities being left to the purview of other&#13;
existing or planned sectoral operations.&#13;
B. Overview&#13;
1.3    The economic mismanagement and political chaos of the 1970s and the early 1980s in&#13;
Uganda severely decimated one of the most respected and effective public administrations in&#13;
Eastern Africa. With migration, Ugandan human capacity was further eroded. The National&#13;
Resistance (NRM) Government assumed power in January 1986 and capacity building efforts in&#13;
Uganda commenced in concert with the Economic Recovery Program through the Civil Service&#13;
Reform (CSR) program. Recognizing that the lack of capacity in Uganda could as much be&#13;
attributed to the absence of sufficient remuneration and proper incentives, as to the absence of&#13;
skilled staff, GOU began an aggressive effort to increase remuneration in the Civil Service. The&#13;
initiative was constrained by the lack of revenues collected by Government and, of necessity,&#13;
increasing salaries meant reducing the total complement of staff through rationalizing Ministerial&#13;
structures. The CSR program is discussed in detail in Section I.C below. Even as the CSR&#13;
program was being implemented, GOU began a systemic evaluation of its approach to Technical&#13;
Assistance which resulted in the Uganda Policy on Technical Assistance, issued in May 1993&#13;
(discussed in Section I.D). GOU also began determining, in addition to the overall CSR program,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
the priority areas upon which it should focus and this resulted in the Uganda Capacity Building&#13;
Plan published in February 1994 (discussed in Section I.E. below).&#13;
C. Capacity Building in the Civil Service&#13;
1.4    Central Government Reform. Through the Economic Recovery Program launched by the&#13;
Government in 1987, the decline in standards and efficiency of the Civil Service has largely been&#13;
arrested. The initial attempts at reform focused on reducing the numbers of part time employees&#13;
and rationalizing the numbers, roles and functions of ministries. Then, in October 1990, a policy&#13;
framework for a comprehensive civil service reform was presented by the Public Service Review&#13;
and Reorganization Commission (PSRRC). The Commission's report, which included some 255&#13;
specific recommendations concluded that the Ugandan Civil Service had been marked not only by&#13;
its bloated structure, but also by inefficiency and poor performance. Key problems were:&#13;
inadequate pay and benefits; poor management skills; dysfunctional civil service organization; and&#13;
inadequate personnel management and training. This led to abuse of office and government&#13;
property; moonlighting and corruption; lack of discipline; an erosion of rules and regulations;&#13;
obsolete procedures; lack of appropriate systems; thin managerial and technical skills; poor public&#13;
service attitudes; and massive bureaucratic red tape. In 1992 the major recommendations of the&#13;
Committee were adopted as a framework for reform through Sessional Paper No. 1. The chosen&#13;
strategy includes: rationalization and downsizing of the civil service, reform of remuneration&#13;
policy and payroll administration, restructuring of ministries and decentralization of governmental&#13;
functions and development and introduction of improved personnel management systems.&#13;
1.5    To date, an impressive number of steps have been taken towards creating a small, well&#13;
motivated and remunerated civil service capable of delivering timely and improved service to the&#13;
public. Achievements include: significant real increases in salaries (although salary levels are still&#13;
far below the Minimum Living Wage prescribed by the PSRRC); a reduction in the number of&#13;
ministries from 38 in 1989 to 21 currently, and the rationalization of ministerial structures to&#13;
remove duplications and overlaps as well as to reduce encroachment on the private sector.&#13;
Significant progress has also been achieved in the removal of ghost workers, redundant employees,&#13;
the overage and the poor performers reducing Central Government civil service staff from 1990&#13;
payroll payments of 320,000 employees to around 148,000 as of December 1994.&#13;
1.6    Despite the substantial achievements, the following issues remain to be addressed:&#13;
continuing insufficiency of remuneration, i.e. pay and benefits (including non-monetary benefits)&#13;
and major design weaknesses in the current pay and grading system which add lack of equity and&#13;
transparency to the basic issue of low pay; insufficient management and supervisory skills;&#13;
inadequate personnel management and training; lack of a Code of Conduct for Civil Servants; and&#13;
inadequate facilities management and lack of a maintenance culture.&#13;
1.7    Previous and ongoing efforts by Government and related support from donors, in&#13;
particular the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the Overseas Development&#13;
Administration of the United Kingdom (ODA), and the International Development Association&#13;
(IDA) have, of necessity, focused on restoring efficiency to the core aspects of government&#13;
business (e.g., planning, budgeting, control of financial and monetary resources). Aspects of&#13;
reform in the Central Government need to be continued and assisted, particularly in relation to the&#13;
areas identified in para. 1.6 above. However, the purview of the assistance needs to be also&#13;
extended to Local Governments (i.e. District Level and below) as a result of Government's&#13;
decision to adopt a decentralized approach to management and delivery of public services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.8    Decentralization. After taking power in 1986, one of the first goals enunciated by the&#13;
NRM Government in its overall framework of social-political policy was that of decentralization.&#13;
In 1987, political decentralization was introduced through the Resistance Council (RC) system&#13;
which consisted of a hierarchical structure of Councils and Commnittees. Commencing in 1986, the&#13;
Government also began studying the issue of decentralization of administrative authorities and&#13;
responsibilities to the thirty nine Districts in Uganda to match the RC structure. There have been&#13;
various reports produced over the last seven years and in 1991, Cabinet considered and approved&#13;
measures to strengthen democratic decentralization.  Also, in 1992, a Standing Committee on&#13;
Decentralization consisting of Permanent Secretaries was established, and a Decentralization&#13;
Secretariat set up in the Ministry of Local Government. In November 1993, Parliament enacted&#13;
the Local Governments (Resistance Councils) Statute. The implementation of this Statute will&#13;
result in Central Government functions being reduced to policy formulation, planning, inspection&#13;
and the management of national programs. All other services would be provided at or below the&#13;
District level. In addition to locally raised revenues, Central Government would provide support&#13;
through block grants and equalization grants (the latter compensating for disparity between&#13;
districts).&#13;
1.9    The implementation of decentralization is well underway and the commitment of Central&#13;
and Local Governments to its implementation is evident. Work on personnel decentralization is&#13;
well advanced: (a) District Service Committees for all districts have been appointed; and (b) the&#13;
District Reviews (which would establish structures and staffing) for all Districts have been&#13;
completed and approval of these Reviews by the District Resistance Councils of most districts has&#13;
also been completed. Financial decentralization is being implemented in a phased manner. The&#13;
recurrent budget is being decentralized commencing with thirteen Districts in the first year,&#13;
fourteen Districts in the second year and twelve Districts in the last year. During the first year of&#13;
decentralization which commenced in 1993/94, the first thirteen Districts were responsible for&#13;
managing expenditures (and reporting to Central Government) on the basis of specific votes for&#13;
each sector Ministry which was having its services decentralized.  In the second year of&#13;
decentralization, 1994/95, the first thirteen Districts have received block grants from the Central&#13;
Government. The District Resistance Councils are responsible for deciding on allocation of the&#13;
block grant among the various services provided. Salaries have been excluded from the block&#13;
grant (and remain a line item) since the District Reviews are in process and the staffing levels have&#13;
yet to be agreed between the Central Government and the Districts. In 1994/95, the second group&#13;
of fourteen Districts went to the vote system. In 1995/96 the remaining group of twelve Districts&#13;
will go to the vote system; the first twenty seven Districts will go the block grant system at the&#13;
same time. Hence, by 1996/97 the financial decentralization process for the recurrent budget&#13;
would have been completed.   Progress to date in the thirteen Districts with financial&#13;
decentralization is being monitored closely by the Ministry of Local Government and is reported&#13;
as being good; only two out of thirteen Districts were considered to have had unsatisfactory&#13;
performance in expenditure management and remedial actions have been instituted.&#13;
1.10   In addition to the decentralized activities, some activities which were to have been&#13;
provided by the Central Government per the Second Schedule of the Statute (e.g. hospitals,&#13;
secondary schools) have been delegated to the Districts. A substantial improvement in service&#13;
delivery has resulted. For example, hospitals in Jinja, Masaka, Itojo and Kabale are reported to&#13;
have experienced substantial improvement in number of patients (including outpatients) served,&#13;
availability of drugs, food to patients, rehabilitation of premises, payment of staff salaries and&#13;
utility bills, etc.  Other notable achievements include savings on staff payments through&#13;
identification of ghost employees and contracting out of services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
1.11    Despite the achievements to-date, it can be expected that successful implementation of the&#13;
decentralization program is likely to remain extremely challenging because of shortcomings in&#13;
resources and human capacities in the Local Governments. Major shortcomings that will need to&#13;
be addressed include: lack of appropriate personnel and financial management systems/registries&#13;
required to manage the substantially higher level of finances and personnel under the direct control&#13;
of the districts after decentralization. Use of Central Government resources has also resulted in&#13;
several new reporting requirements. Shortage of staff and the need for extensive training of&#13;
available staff also exists in several key areas such as planning, finance/accounting, etc. Finally,&#13;
under the Statute, the RCIII (i.e. the sub-county) level has a substantial role in revenue and&#13;
expenditure management. While certain districts (e.g. Jinja) had already commenced providing&#13;
sub-counties with the responsibility for retaining and managing a proportion of resources, in most&#13;
districts strengthening the sub-counties will be a substantial task. Thus, Government is in need of&#13;
considerable assistance in order to help maintain its current commitment to reform and successfully&#13;
effect this fundamental change in its approach to management of the economy and delivery of&#13;
services.&#13;
1.12   Donor Support for Decentralization. The Government of Denmark, through the Danish&#13;
International Development Association (DANIDA) has been the lead donor and has provided/is&#13;
providing support to Government in various ways. First, when IDA's District Management Study&#13;
became the focus of debate and analysis within Government, experts were funded to help&#13;
Government in its decision making process.  Second, an inter-disciplinary task force which&#13;
prepared the implementation modalities and reviewed the Local Government Statute was financed.&#13;
Third, the establishment and operations of the Decentralization Secretariat are being partially&#13;
financed. Fourth, substantial support for training and technical assistance is being provided up to&#13;
March 1997. Fifth, some districts were supplied with limited office equipment. Finally, the&#13;
District Development Program of one district (Rakai) is being financed. IDA has supported the&#13;
decentralization program so far through sector work, i.e. the District Management Study (Report&#13;
No. 10695-UG) and the Economic and Financial Management (EFM) Project (Cr. 2418-UG).&#13;
Under that project, the District Reviews being conducted by Government have been supported.&#13;
Other activities being implemented will also have an impact: systems and procedures being&#13;
developed for central personnel and financial management will provide an important underpinning&#13;
for decentralized systems; and some funds have been allocated for a program to commence&#13;
implementation of and train staff for decentralized personnel and financial systems.&#13;
D. Uganda Policy on Technical Assistance&#13;
1.13   The Uganda Policy on Technical Assistance, May 1993 (which was prepared by GOU as&#13;
part of a UNDP funded National Capacity Planning exercise), classifies technical assistance&#13;
activities as either investment related or as free standing; under the Bank definitions, the&#13;
freestanding Technical Assistance (TA) would include both policy support and capacity building.&#13;
The study established that between 1988 and 1991, commitments for technical assistance support&#13;
grew from US$65 million to US$133 million. Investment related TA accounted for only 21 % of&#13;
the resources; 79% was free standing. The report notes that the majority of the free standing TA&#13;
was represented by smnall disjointed project interventions that usually have little impact on the&#13;
overall economic performance. Consequently, the new policy defines a process which would:&#13;
(a) at first, ensure that TA priorities meshed with national plan and budget priorities and,&#13;
later, include TA projects as part of the budgeting process;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
(b) ensure that GOU takes the lead in project identification and that all TA projects are&#13;
channelled through the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP);&#13;
(c) focus on the motivation of nationals and on the provision of an enabling environment&#13;
specifically in the civil service;&#13;
(d) follow a country program approach as opposed to a project approach;&#13;
(e) use national execution by Government as the primary modality for implementing TA&#13;
projects supplemented by use of local consultants and expatriate nationals. Use of long&#13;
term expatriate advisors would be reduced to the minimum necessary with increase in the&#13;
use of short-term consultants, where necessary; and&#13;
(f) TA would no longer focus only on the public sector but could be extended to the private&#13;
sector (including non-governmental organizations).&#13;
E. Uganda Capacity Building Plan&#13;
1.14    The Capacity Building Plan (CBP) for Uganda provides a coordinated framework of the&#13;
priority areas where GOU with donor assistance could focus in the short- to medium-term. The&#13;
preparation of the CBP was preceded in 1990 by a comprehensive sector report on Capacity&#13;
Building prepared by the Ugandan Government and IDA together with the participation of a&#13;
number of other donor agencies concerned with capacity building in Uganda.  In 1991,&#13;
Government set up a Capacity Building Secretariat (CBS) in the Ministry of Planning and&#13;
Economic Development (now merged into the new Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning).&#13;
This Secretariat was supported by an advance of US$185,000 from IDA's Special Project&#13;
Preparation Facility. While being organizationally within one Ministry, the CBS had participation&#13;
from a number of key ministries, the private sector and the major training and higher educational&#13;
institutions in the country. The CBS commissioned various local consultancies to study a range&#13;
of options and possibilities which formed background papers for the development of a Capacity&#13;
Building Plan for Uganda. The Plan was completed and, in February 1994, approved by the&#13;
President's Economic Council. Subsequently, in April 1994, Government held a workshop to&#13;
present the findings of the plan to donors and to assess donor support for various initiatives&#13;
described in the Plan.&#13;
1.15    The Capacity Building Plan (CBP) identified ten priority areas for enhancing capacity.&#13;
The project is supporting three of these priority areas: legal and judicial systems; accountancy&#13;
profession; and local training institutions.  The issues in these areas are discussed below.&#13;
Additional areas of emphasis included under the CBP which are considered key areas of capacity&#13;
building are: economic policy analysis within and outside Government; manpower planning and&#13;
linkages to the training function; local management training institutions;  return of skilled&#13;
Ugandans; local consultancy profession; technical and vocational education and industrial training&#13;
capacity; contribution of women to policy development and management; and non-governmental&#13;
organizations.&#13;
Legal Sector&#13;
1.16    The Constitution of Uganda and the Juridicature Act of 1967 constitute the foundation&#13;
of the Ugandan legal system, i.e. the continued application of the received English law and its co-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
existence with the customary law of Uganda. The body of statutory law (i.e. laws made by the&#13;
legislature) is made up of largely outdated legislation in almost every sector especially laws which&#13;
affect business, industry and private sector development.&#13;
1.17    The problem of outdated laws is exacerbated by the absence of timely and rigorous&#13;
enforcement of these laws due to weaknesses in the major institutions in the sector. These&#13;
institutions are the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs (MJCA), the Constitutional&#13;
Commission, the Human Rights Commission, the Law Reform  Commission and the Law&#13;
Development Centre; the Law Council; the Judiciary, the Resistance Council Courts (which are&#13;
a parallel system of courts which exist with respect to lower level courts) and the police. In&#13;
general the sector is confronted with the following problems: insufficient staffing of lawyers,&#13;
paralegal and secretarial staff; outdated office equipment and technology and the lack of proper&#13;
office facilities; absence of in-service and other training programs; absence of easily available&#13;
documentation with regard to the Laws of Uganda (which were last published in 1964) and the&#13;
latest Court decisions (Law Reports were last published in Uganda in the early 1970s); and lack&#13;
of office supplies. One of the actions that Government has undertaken in the recent past to&#13;
demonstrate its commitment to reforming the sector is to significantly increase the salaries of&#13;
professional lawyers as of July 1994.  It is anticipated that the increased salaries would&#13;
appropriately complement the inputs provided under the project and hence there should be a&#13;
substantial impetus to project viability and sustainability.&#13;
1.18    Donor Assistance. Assistance in addressing the problems in the legal sector has been&#13;
forthcoming on a limited basis from DANIDA, ODA, USAID and the Austrian Government. It&#13;
has been mostly directed towards the provision of office equipment, vehicles and books, the&#13;
upgrading of selected physical facilities, especially courts, and the supply of expatriate technical&#13;
assistance to fill vacancies.&#13;
Accountancy Profession&#13;
1.19    The development of accounting in Uganda has fallen behind the rest of Africa due to the&#13;
past lack of support from the Government of Uganda (GOU) in the formation of the accounting&#13;
profession and in the development of a local professional qualification. Uganda has a very small&#13;
accounting profession, with less than 100 professionally qualified accountants and a similarly&#13;
serious shortage of accounting technicians. The demand for accountants is very high, but because&#13;
of the small numbers most accounting jobs are filled by staff with no formal accounting&#13;
qualifications who may not be capable of carrying out the tasks assigned to them. In Government,&#13;
the lack of qualified staff is exacerbated by the low remuneration and consequently, Government&#13;
has been unable to produce its own accounts on time.&#13;
1.20    As a result of the mismatch between supply and demand, there is a heavy demand for&#13;
accounting education in Uganda and the only accounting courses currently offered in the public&#13;
sector are heavily oversubscribed. The only professional accounting qualification available to&#13;
Ugandans are foreign ones: i.e., a Kenyan Certified Public Accountancy qualification or a UK&#13;
qualification; either qualification requires expenditure of large amounts of foreign exchange.&#13;
Further, the taxation and legal systems which are studied as part of the Kenyan and UK&#13;
qualifications are not relevant to Uganda and due to unfamiliarity with these systems, Ugandan&#13;
students achieve a lower pass rate in both examinations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
1.21    In recent years, the GOU has realized that the development of accounting is important&#13;
for the economy. As a first step, it sought donor support in the form of discrete projects aimed&#13;
at improving the skills of specific cadres (i.e. accountants and auditors) within Government. Donor&#13;
support in the development of the profession and a local examination has consisted of two studies&#13;
both funded by ODA which laid out the next steps required in developing the profession and an&#13;
examination. Based on the findings of the above studies, the accountancy profession worked with&#13;
GOU to legislate the necessary changes. In 1992, Parliament passed the Accountants Statute which&#13;
established the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Uganda (ICPAU) to regulate the&#13;
profession and maintain standards, and the Public Accountants Examinations Board to conduct&#13;
accounting examinations. Unfortunately, during the passage of the Bill through Parliament, some&#13;
changes were introduced which have led to continuing disputes regarding the membership of the&#13;
Institute. The Statute allows for two categories of members: full and associate with only full&#13;
members allowed to vote at the Annual General Meeting and be elected to the Council of the&#13;
Institute. Hence, while the Statute provides plenty of reassurance for all those currently engaged&#13;
in the practice of accounting that they would be able to continue to do so, it provides for a separate&#13;
category (i.e. full members) who would be expected to lead the profession.&#13;
1.22    As with similar Acts, the Statute contains a list of bodies whose members could be&#13;
admitted into full membership, without the need to take any additional examinations. This list was&#13;
initially restricted to internationally recognized qualifications of professional accountants in other&#13;
countries. However, during the passage of the Bill through Parliament, four other bodies were&#13;
added on the list, three of which are not associations of professional accountants. Of particular&#13;
concern to professional accountants was the inclusion of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and&#13;
Administrators since, while qualified in the field of their specialization, the Chartered Secretaries&#13;
training does not prepare them to be professionally qualified accountants. Further, since there are&#13;
more Chartered Secretaries in Uganda than professionally qualified accountants, if admitted as full&#13;
members they could have dominated the Institute. Not being led by professional accountants could&#13;
have seriously hinder the development of the accounting profession in Uganda as well as reduced&#13;
the possibility of the Ugandan qualification being internationally accepted.&#13;
1.23    GOU has recently amended the Statute to exclude the three professional associations of&#13;
concern to the professional accountants, i.e. Association of International Accountants of UK, the&#13;
Institute of Chartered Managers and Administrators and Institute of Chartered Secretaries and&#13;
Administrators. This has allowed the ICPAU to hold its first Annual General Meeting and to elect&#13;
its Governing Council. These actions had been required prior to negotiations in order to ensure&#13;
IDA support to the Accountancy profession.&#13;
Training&#13;
1.24    Training of Civil Service staff has in the past been undertaken in an ad hoc manner.&#13;
There has been no overall training plan for GOU staff and a large proportion of the training has&#13;
been undertaken through donor funding, often in the context of specific projects. Further, the past&#13;
approach to the improvement of training delivery in Uganda has focused upon improving the&#13;
available supply of training. Specific institutions were chosen and assisted, primarily by donors,&#13;
through provision of:  civil works, equipment and technical assistance (including twinning&#13;
arrangements), overseas training and study tours. This approach has had two main shortcomings.&#13;
First, public and private sector entities which constitute the demand for training have had only a&#13;
marginal input into the structure of courses being provided by the training institutions. The only&#13;
choice available to these institutions has been to send their staff to the available local training or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
send their staff outside Uganda at a higher cost to be trained in more relevant skill areas. The lack&#13;
of market orientation was due to a low impetus for cost recovery. Since the training institutions&#13;
were being funded directly by Government or donors, the need to get revenues from the trainees&#13;
was not an overarching objective. This in turn meant that tailoring courses to trainee needs and&#13;
improving capacity utilization were not important priorities. Hence, the available local supply of&#13;
training determined the demand for local training rather than the demand for training determining&#13;
the supply of training. Second, other than the few institutions supported by donor funding, there&#13;
was been no broad based development of local training institutions since there was no functioning&#13;
market for matching demand and supply of training. Further, the existing training institutions,&#13;
which received direct subsidy from Government and subsidies in kind from donor funded civil&#13;
works, equipment, etc. were able to offer lower prices than the smaller institutions.&#13;
F. IDA's Previous Role and Lessons Learned&#13;
1.25    Over the last seven years (1987-1993), Government has received significant assistance&#13;
from IDA. IDA's Second Technical Assistance Project (FY84-92) and Third Technical Assistance&#13;
Project (FY87-94) had as their prime objective the strengthening of the core agencies of&#13;
Government: the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development and&#13;
the Central Bank. There were some important lessons learned from these two successful technical&#13;
assistance projects which were incorporated into the follow-on Economic and Financial&#13;
Management Credit (FY93): subprojects/interventions were targeted to areas closely coupled with&#13;
the ongoing reform effort and were in some cases upstream sector work for further reform efforts;&#13;
and TA was designed and implemented with utmost flexibility, consistent with the Development&#13;
Credit Agreement, which required greater amounts of supervision.&#13;
1.26    The approach utilized in the proposed project for the upstream activities which precede&#13;
project preparation is similar to the successful approach under the earlier projects. First, the&#13;
upstream sector work was undertaken at an early stage and in a collaborative manner with GOU&#13;
and other interested donors. Second, the problems/issues identified were prioritized into key areas&#13;
to be addressed in the process of developing the Capacity Building Plan. From the overall list of&#13;
GOU's priorities, IDA selected a few areas of assistance. While building upon the successful&#13;
accomplishments of the past projects, this project's emphasis has shifted for two reasons. First,&#13;
the focus has shifted from addressing areas requiring immediate improvement to strengthening local&#13;
institutions/building capacity for the future. The magnitude of the problems and the need to&#13;
reestablish critical functions had required a focus on immediate results and resulted in significant&#13;
use of expatriate assistance. The situation having stabilized, it is now appropriate to widen the&#13;
focus from short term problem solving to building indigenous capacity, i.e. developing lasting&#13;
systems and skills. Second, given the decentralization of activities to the district level, the project&#13;
has expanded its focus to include local governments.&#13;
1.27    Linkages with other IDA operations. The EFM  Project (FY93), which is currently&#13;
underway, is assisting in the restructuring of the now combined Ministries of Finance and Planning&#13;
and the integration of Government's key planning and financial systems; helping to develop the&#13;
newly created Uganda Revenue Authority, and completing the reorganization of practices and&#13;
procedures at the Central Bank. The EFM Project has two components which have linkages with&#13;
the proposed project. First, the District Reviews being conducted by Government have been&#13;
supported. Second, other activities under implementation will also have an impact: systems and&#13;
procedures for central personnel and financial management will provide an important underpinning&#13;
for decentralized systems; and some funds have been allocated for a program to commence&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
implementation of and train staff for decentralized personnel and financial systems. The Second&#13;
Structural Adjustment Credit (FY94) also has some conditionalities related to the Civil Service&#13;
Reform program, i.e. satisfactory progress towards the monetization of benefits and the&#13;
implementation of action plans for restructuring of five ministries constitute second tranche release&#13;
conditions.&#13;
1.28    Parallel Financing. Over the last two years there has been considerable donor activity&#13;
in the areas of capacity building. Various donors have been involved with different elements of&#13;
capacity building including: DANIDA (with judiciary and decentralization reforms); USAID and&#13;
ODA (judiciary); and UNDP (CSR and NGOs); and EEC (human resource development). In&#13;
addition, the Civil Service Reform program has broad based support from several donors including&#13;
UNDP, ODA, Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden who have funded costs of&#13;
restructuring the Civil Service and downsizing the central ministries.&#13;
G. Rationale for IDA involvement&#13;
1.29    The project is closely linked with the objectives of the Bank Group Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy, which is to help the country reduce poverty by: (a) maximizing labor-intensive&#13;
economic growth; (b) strengthening economic and social infrastructure; (c) supporting human&#13;
resource development; and (d) enhancing provision of public services with emphasis on ensuring&#13;
that these services reach the poor and vulnerable groups. The strategy is designed to be both&#13;
gender and environmentally sensitive and is consistent with the maintenance of macroeconomic&#13;
stability.&#13;
1.30    The project focuses on three of the key areas of the Country Strategy, i.e. enhancing the&#13;
provision of public services; supporting human resource development through capacity building;&#13;
and improving economic growth. As capacity building is being extended to local governments at&#13;
the district level and below, this is likely to improve resource mobilization and management and&#13;
consequently enhance service delivery at the level at which most of the population (and the poor)&#13;
live in Uganda.  The project's secondary focus is on developing the legal and financial&#13;
accountability frameworks for public and private sector development. The focus on training in&#13;
implementation skills would also contribute towards raising the standards of public administration&#13;
while supporting the development of stronger private sector institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
2.1    The objectives of the project are to establish greater local institutional and human capacity&#13;
to develop and implement public policy and support the growth of the private sector through: (a)&#13;
support for the continuation of the Civil Service Reform; (b) assistance to the Government of&#13;
Uganda in its decentralization program; and (c) strengthening the legal and financial accountability&#13;
framework and institutions.&#13;
B. Summary Project Description&#13;
2.2    The project will consist of five components as described below:&#13;
(a) Central Government Capacity Building Component (US$6.62 million): would continue&#13;
support to the Civil Service Reform program (which is currently being provided through&#13;
the EFM Project). Assistance would be provided for: streamlining of the civil service,&#13;
improving the transparency of personnel management and focusing the civil service on&#13;
efficient and effective service delivery.&#13;
(b) Local Government Capacity Building Component (US$12.74 million): would support&#13;
Government's ongoing decentralization program through assisting in defining and&#13;
implementing an appropriate system of inter-governmental finance. It would continue the&#13;
process of strengthening local government financial and personnel management structures,&#13;
systems and procedures. It would assist in improvement in service delivery through the&#13;
introduction of Results Oriented Management to local Governments and through basic&#13;
retooling, i.e. minor civil works and equipment.&#13;
(c) Legal Sector Reform  Component (US$8.24 million):  would strengthen the legal&#13;
framework for private sector development, improve availability of legal decisions,&#13;
support strengthening of major institutions in the legal sector (such as the Ministry of&#13;
Justice and Constitutional Affairs and Judiciary) and introduce improvements in legal&#13;
education and training.&#13;
(d) Accountancy Profession Component (US$0.98 million): would support the development&#13;
of the professional association (the ICPAU), the establishment of a local professional&#13;
qualification and examining capability and the introduction of local accounting and&#13;
auditing standards.&#13;
(e) Training Funds Component (US$7.02 million): would pilot a demand driven process of&#13;
providing funds on a cost sharing basis to public and private sector institutions to acquire&#13;
their training needs for implementation skills from the local market. It would also assist&#13;
selectively identified weak training institutions with potential for improvement through&#13;
staff training and acquisition of study materials and equipment on a cost sharing basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
C. Detailed Project Description&#13;
Central Government Capacity Building&#13;
2.3    As has been described in part C of Section I, substantial efforts have been made by&#13;
Government to implement a CSR program. The support to this CSR program would continue by&#13;
bringing several ongoing activities to completion and developing the next stage of the reform&#13;
process. The component would continue assistance in streamlining of the civil service, improving&#13;
the transparency of personnel management and focusing the civil service on efficient and effective&#13;
service delivery.&#13;
2.4    Support to the streamlining of the civil service would be provided at two levels. First,&#13;
the overall program being managed through the Ministry of Public Service (MPS) would be&#13;
supported especially through:&#13;
(a) improving central personnel management systems;&#13;
(b) supporting key bodies and staff undertaking a civil- service-wide classification of&#13;
personnel from the perspective of identifying candidates for termination as a result of&#13;
restructuring/redundancy activities;&#13;
Second, at the level of individual ministries, the project would:&#13;
(c) support the implementation of ministerial restructuring plans (or Ministerial Reviews) for&#13;
sixteen ministries; the restructuring of the remaining five ministries is already underway.&#13;
Further, since the restructuring plans do not incorporate the impact of decentralization,&#13;
the project would support work to redefine and harmonize the new structures and&#13;
establishment for the Central Government based on the approved structure and staffing&#13;
of the districts as contained in the district restructuring plans (or District Reviews); and&#13;
(d) Ministry level personnel management functions would be strengthened.&#13;
2.5    The second area of focus would be in improving the transparency of personnel&#13;
administration. Specifically:&#13;
(a) Improved personnel management practices would be established, i.e. a new salary&#13;
structure would be established by July 1996.  Other key activities would include&#13;
introduction of Civil Service examinations and issuance of revised Standing Orders and&#13;
introduction of a Performance Recognition System.&#13;
(b) To support the move towards greater transparency, all Civil Servants will be expected&#13;
to adhere to a new Code of Conduct which would be developed and issued by July 1996.&#13;
(c) To ensure compliance with the new procedures, the MPS Department of Inspection would&#13;
be strengthened primarily through development of inspection procedures and staff&#13;
training.&#13;
2.6    The focus on effectiveness will come through introduction of Results Oriented&#13;
Management (ROM) which will focus civil servants on service delivery through the achievement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
of definite objectives within specified time targets. The project would support a baseline Service&#13;
Delivery Survey for Central Ministries which would collate data on quantifiable outputs and user&#13;
perception surveys. This would establish the reference point for future measurement and be used&#13;
to develop performance standards for each Ministry. These standards would then be introduced&#13;
as part of GOU's budgeting procedures from the 1996/97 budgeting cycle to link service delivery&#13;
with budgetary provision.&#13;
2.7    The focus on efficiency will come through improvement in two important support services&#13;
underlying service delivery, i.e. facilities management and records management.&#13;
(a) Capacity for Facility and Physical Assets Management. A study of the best approach to&#13;
managing physical facilities, i.e. buildings, physical plant and equipment would be&#13;
undertaken. The study would also review the utilization of Ugandan Government&#13;
physical facilities abroad, recommend the optimal size of such facilities and approaches&#13;
to managing them.  The new policy would be implemented as part of the GOU's&#13;
budgeting procedures commencing from the 1997/98 budgeting cycle.&#13;
(b) Strengthening of the Records Management Function. The project would complement&#13;
ongoing activities being undertaken through ODA funding. These activities have and&#13;
would continue to focus on defining an overall policy framework and records&#13;
management policies and procedures and assisting in the timely access to information in&#13;
several ministries.  The project would complement the program by providing staff&#13;
training and assisting in the establishment of a National Records Centre.&#13;
2.8    Training. A substantial portion of the training for the Civil Service would be undertaken&#13;
through the Training Funds component. However, two critical activities would be funded under&#13;
this component, i.e. development of training plans and senior management training.&#13;
2.9    A detailed description of the Central Government Capacity Building component is provided&#13;
in Annex 7.&#13;
Local Government Capacity Building&#13;
2.10   This component would continue the process of assisting local governments through the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government (MLG) to improve their abilities to properly manage and administer&#13;
responsibilities entrusted to them and thus improve the quality of service delivery in a viable and&#13;
sustainable manner. It would complement assistance already being provided by DANIDA.&#13;
2.11   Inter-Governmental Finance.   The project would assist in the definition and&#13;
implementation of an appropriate system of inter-governmental finance. A study of the&#13;
decentralization of the development budget would be completed by June 1996 and phased&#13;
decentralization would commence by July 1997. A study would also be undertaken to propose&#13;
establishment, capitalization and management of a revolving development fund; this study is&#13;
projected to be completed by June 1996 and a GOU position statement on its findings is to be&#13;
issued by December 1996. Recognizing the evolving agenda and the consequent need for&#13;
flexibility in defining the program, funds have also been provided for specific activities to be&#13;
defined at a later date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.12   Strengthening offinancial and personnel management structures, systems and procedures.&#13;
This would include computerization of accounts, preparation of final accounts and preparation of&#13;
resource endowment profiles. The project would provide support to computerization of the&#13;
decentralized payroll and decentralized records management and the redesign of the pension&#13;
system. The credit would also support training in basic computer skills and records management;&#13;
a substantial portion of other training (sensitization and skills development) would be undertaken&#13;
through DANIDA funding and from the EFM Project. The key outcomes are expected to be:&#13;
(a) the preparation and auditing of local government accounts within the six months time limit&#13;
prescribed in the Local Governments Statute. By March 1996, twenty seven districts are expected&#13;
to be in compliance and by March 1997 all thirty nine districts are expected to be in compliance&#13;
with the Statute; and (b) by July 1995, consolidated payroll processing of all District&#13;
Administration staff and staff formerly employed by the Central Government would be undertaken&#13;
by the Uganda Computer Services on behalf of the districts. Further, it is projected that between&#13;
July 1996 and June 1997 the districts would implement a decentralized management of payroll.&#13;
2.13   Results Oriented Management. The credit would support the introduction of ROM at the&#13;
district level in a manner similar to that envisaged for the Central Ministries (para. 2.6). Training&#13;
in planning at the district level would also be supported. ROM is expected to be incorporated into&#13;
Local Government budgeting procedures commencing with the 1996/97 budget cycle.&#13;
2.14    Retooling, i.e. the basic improvements required to establish a reasonable level of physical&#13;
infrastructure for the district administrations would be supported; existing structures would be&#13;
refurbished to provide modest office out of which District Administrations could operate. Essential&#13;
inputs (e.g. office and computing equipment and furnishings) would also be provided.&#13;
2.15   The project would also provide modest financing for the transportation needs of districts&#13;
related to revenue collection and monitoring and supervising district-wide activities. The cost of&#13;
the vehicles would be completely recovered from the districts over a five year repayment period&#13;
and deposited into a Revolving Fund dedicated for purchase of vehicles. The cost recovery&#13;
approach is expected to encourage the districts to choose the lowest cost solutions for their needs.&#13;
This scheme is expected to commence by January 1996.&#13;
2.16    A detailed description of the Local Government Capacity Building component is provided&#13;
in Annex 8.&#13;
Legal Sector Reform Component&#13;
2.17    This sector has received only limited assistance to-date without an overall coordinated&#13;
approach to developing the sector. GOU has developed, in the context of the Capacity Building&#13;
Plan, an overall program for reforming the sector. IDA's support and the assistance provided&#13;
under this project is focused upon the commercial aspects of law and on the settlement of civil&#13;
disputes as required by IDA's current policies which take into account the fact that its primary&#13;
mandate is economic development. The specific areas to be supported through the project are&#13;
described below and the project component will be coordinated through the MJCA.&#13;
2.18   Legal Education, Training and Accreditation of Lawyers. The current system of legal&#13;
education in Uganda is based on the recommendations made by the Gower Commission in 1969.&#13;
Under this system, after completing the substantive study of the law, all prospective lawyers in&#13;
Uganda have to undergo training in professional skills for a period of one year. This training can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
only be undertaken at the Law Development Centre (LDC) which limits its intake of students to&#13;
sixty per year.  Over the years, LDC's ability to provide legal training has deteriorated&#13;
considerably. As LDC has struggled to meet its statutory obligations for pre-service training and&#13;
law research and reporting, it has been unable to dedicate any significant level of resources to&#13;
Continuing Legal Education (CLE) for the profession. This situation has been exacerbated by the&#13;
absence of any mandatory requirements for CLE for lawyers as a requirement to maintain their&#13;
ability to continue in practice. In order to ensure that these needs are satisfactorily addressed, a&#13;
substantial change in the delivery of legal education and training in Uganda is required. As a first&#13;
step, the project is funding a study to evaluate the existing status of legal education in Uganda with&#13;
a view to finding ways and means of making it more relevant and responsive to the changing&#13;
conditions in the country. Taking into account the findings of this study, GOU will adopt a&#13;
satisfactory policy on legal education. GOU furnishing a statement defining its Policy on Legal&#13;
Education is a condition of disbursement for the legal sector component.&#13;
2.19   Law Revision and Reform in Uganda. These are two related activities which are separate&#13;
but have several linkages. Law revision is the process of consolidating various Laws of Uganda&#13;
into a series of volumes with the objective of making these Laws readily available to various&#13;
participants in the legal process.  Law reform is the amendment of specific laws from the&#13;
perspective of modernizing these laws within the socio-economic context prevalent in Uganda and&#13;
removing impediments to Government's stated objective of making the private sector the focal&#13;
point for growth in the economy. The Law Revision exercise would be undertaken through parallel&#13;
donor financing (USAID to fund the consolidation of laws and ODA to fund the printing of the&#13;
laws). This component would focus upon law reform to assist in Private Sector Development. The&#13;
prioritization of laws requiring reform was undertaken; the private sector was consulted through&#13;
a one-day workshop which was held in Kampala in October 1994. The prioritized list of laws&#13;
identified for reform during the period of project implementation was subsequently agreed with&#13;
IDA. The necessary draft laws are to be prepared, published as bills and submitted for the&#13;
legislature's consideration by July 1996. Assistance would also be given to reform of the Domestic&#13;
Relations laws which primarily impact on the rights of women and have bearing on the position&#13;
and treatment of women within society and their ability to engage independently in constructive&#13;
commercial/economic activity. The draft Domestic Relations Bill is to be presented to the&#13;
legislature for consideration by December 1996.&#13;
2.20   Law Reporting. The Ugandan legal system is based on common law which has a legal&#13;
theory that is deeply rooted in the precedent system. In the past, there has been no systematic law&#13;
reporting which has handicapped advocates, prosecutors and judges who require readily available&#13;
information on precedents in order to perform their duties. The main series of Uganda Law&#13;
Reports is presently out of production; the backlog dates back to 1958 although between 1971-1973&#13;
three volumes were produced which are also currently out of print. In the absence of funding to&#13;
produce the law reports, a shorter abstract of the decisions made by the Supreme and High Courts&#13;
is currently being published; even this is out of date with its last edition having been published in&#13;
1991. The preparation and publication of Law Reports would be supported by the project and the&#13;
backlog of over three decades would be removed.&#13;
2.21   Institutional Strengthening of MJCA and Judiciary. The institutional weaknesses besetting&#13;
the administration of justice result in delays in the handling of cases thus causing backlogs at all&#13;
levels of the courts. The waiting period for a case awaiting disposal ranges from two to six years.&#13;
Record keeping and retrieval of files is entirely manual and inefficiently organized such that it takes&#13;
a number of days in some instances, to locate the right file. For private sector development,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
speed, transparency and consistency is required in the disposal of commercial litigation in addition&#13;
to the modernization of laws. Institutional strengthening would be undertaken by providing:&#13;
substantial staff training, access to legal information, i.e. law books, updated and revised Laws of&#13;
Uganda and the latest case law as embodied in the Uganda Law Reports, and increased access to&#13;
inputs necessary to accomplish the job.&#13;
2.22   Improving Service Delivery and Increasing Cost Recovery for Legal Sector Services.&#13;
There are certain services provided by the MJCA where there is potential to improve service&#13;
delivery and increase cost recovery thereby increasing resources available to the legal sector. The&#13;
project would commence with two departments where this is immediately feasible, i.e. the&#13;
Administrator-General's Department (AG) and the Registrar-General's Department (RG). The&#13;
AG's Department is charged with administering deceased persons' and insolvent estates, and also&#13;
acts as a Public Trustee for minors and legally incapacitated persons. The RG's Department is&#13;
responsible for registering all businesses and companies, births, deaths, etc, and intellectual&#13;
property such as patents, copyrights and trademarks.  Based on the Ministerial Review for the&#13;
MJCA, Government has decided to devolve both departments from the Ministry and to establish&#13;
them as separate entities. Both departments partially recover the cost of service provision; the AG&#13;
recovers a fee of 1 % at the time of the distribution of funds from the estate and the RG charges&#13;
for services although a substantial portion of its revenue is attributable to stamp duty. Both&#13;
departments have seen their workload increasing; current revenue generation consists of 913&#13;
million U Sh in 1993 for the AG's Department and 486 million U Sh for the RG's Department.&#13;
2.23    There is considerable scope to improve service delivery in both Departments especially&#13;
outside Kampala which would in turn affect both timeliness and quality of services at the district&#13;
level. Studies are underway for both departments to assist in (a) preparation of Business Plans;&#13;
and (b) determination of appropriate cost recovery measures for both departments. For both the&#13;
offices of the Administrator-General and the Registrar-General, the provision of satisfactory&#13;
business plans covering at least thefirst three years of operation are a condition of disbursement.&#13;
2.24    A detailed description of the Legal Sector Reform component is provided in Annex 9.&#13;
Accountancy Strengthening Component&#13;
2.25    GOU having undertaken the preliminary steps necessary for the establishment of the&#13;
Governing Council of the ICPAU, the Institute can now proceed to undertake some important steps&#13;
to determine the future course of development of the profession. Consequently, the conditions of&#13;
disbursement for the Accountancy Strengthening component, would be: (a) appointment of the&#13;
Secretary of the ICPA U; (b) the Council of the ICPA U furnishing to IDA a satisfactory business&#13;
plan covering at least the first three years of operation; and (c) GO U and the ICPA U concluding&#13;
a Subsidiary Grant Agreement.&#13;
2.26    The component would be implemented and would support the accountancy profession by:&#13;
(a) assisting the Institute of Certified Public Accountants to commence operations and fulfil&#13;
the following functions: managing membership of its professional and student base,&#13;
ensuring the maintenance of professional standards amongst members, promoting the&#13;
usage of internally accepted accounting and auditing standards in Uganda and securing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
international recognition of the Institute. The accounting and auditing standards are to&#13;
be completely published by June 1998.&#13;
(b) developing a local professional qualification and associated examination. This would&#13;
include design of a scheme of examinations, with detailed examination syllabi and reading&#13;
lists, and preparation and moderation of examination papers. It is expected that the first&#13;
intake of students will commence by September 1996 and the first examinations will be&#13;
held by June 1997.&#13;
(c) commencing the process of providing Continuing Professional Education and traiiing to&#13;
members of the profession.&#13;
A detailed description of the Accountancy Strengthening component is provided in Annex 10.&#13;
Training Funds Component&#13;
2.27    This component will pilot a system to strengthen: implementation skills in the public and&#13;
private sectors; and public and private sector training institutions through the provision of limited&#13;
assistance on a competitive basis. The component will consist of two Training Funds which would&#13;
be managed by the Capacity Building Secretariat (CBS) in the MFEP:&#13;
(a) The Public Sector and Private Sector Matching Grant Fund (Fund I). This fund would&#13;
provide matching grants to public and private sector institutions for training of their staff.&#13;
For Central Ministries and Districts, Fund I would provide 90% of the resources with&#13;
10% of the resources being provided by the Government entities; actual cost funded by&#13;
government entities would be higher since travel and subsistence allowances paid to&#13;
trainees during training would not be funded under this component. ' Private sector&#13;
organizations would access Fund I through trade/industry associations; the cost sharing&#13;
arrangement would be 50% of the costs of training to be provided by the private sector&#13;
and 50% to be provided by Fund I. The fund would acquire training needs through a&#13;
transparent and competitive bidding process which will allow all local training&#13;
institutions, both publicly funded and private, to participate in service delivery.&#13;
(b) TAe Training Suppliers ' Strengthening Matching Grant Fund (Fund II) would be available&#13;
to selectively identified weak training suppliers which have potential and which would&#13;
be assisted in improving their service delivery capacity. Each training supplier could&#13;
receive assistance for staff training (up to 90 per cent of cost), acquisition of training&#13;
related study materials and books (up to 50 per cent of cost) and equipment (up to 25&#13;
percent of cost). The assistance to each institution would not exceed US$25,000.&#13;
2.28    The CBS will also manage a component of the EFM Project (Assistance to the Economic&#13;
Recovery Program) which has been used largely to acquire critical training needs within&#13;
Government. This program has been successful and funds have been drawn down at a rate faster&#13;
It is important to note that some Government ministries and districts would receive separate&#13;
training under other components which is required for the successful implementation of&#13;
those components. If such Central ministries or districts require additional training, they&#13;
can participate under this Fund on the prescribed cost sharing basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
than projected at the appraisal of the EFM Project. The proposed project provides additional funds&#13;
to finance the program through the end of financial year 1998.&#13;
2.29    Phasing of Implementation. Implementation is phased because the CBS which will&#13;
manage this component and also be responsible for project administration (para. 2.44) will have&#13;
to be rebuilt. Though it has been in existence from 1991, it has been an ad hoc body and its&#13;
members have full time duties elsewhere. The process has commenced with GOU appointing its&#13;
Task Manager for the project as the Head of the CBS. The recruitment process for the group&#13;
managing the Training Funds component (i.e. a Component Manager and a Senior Training&#13;
Officer) is also underway. Once appointed, the staff will familiarize themselves with the training&#13;
processes during a pre-operational phase, i.e. before the component begins disbursing funds. The&#13;
CBS staff will work closely with the Ministries of Public Service and/or Local Government as these&#13;
Ministries procure two rounds of training for the Central Government or Local Government&#13;
Capacity Building components using the demand based procedures to be used under the component.&#13;
The CBS will then use this experience by managing one round of procurement of training for the&#13;
Legal Sector Reform or Accountancy Strengthening components. At the same time, the Training&#13;
Fund implementation guidelines would be reviewed based on the experience in Uganda and other&#13;
African countries where similar approaches are being attempted.&#13;
2.30    Consequently, the condition of disbursement for the Training Funds Component would&#13;
be agreement between GOU and IDA that: (a) the CBS staff have demonstrated capability to&#13;
implement the Training Funds component through (i) participation in the procurement of at least&#13;
two rounds of training under the Central or Local Government Capacity Building components and&#13;
(ii) satisfactory management of at least one round of training under the Legal Sector Reform or&#13;
Accountancy Strengthening components; and (b) the detailed guidelines in the Implementation&#13;
Manual pertaining to the implementation of the Training Funds component would have been&#13;
reviewed and, if warranted by the review, amended in the light of experience. It is expected that,&#13;
based on the projected schedule for hiring and training the Training Fund Component staff, that&#13;
the component would meet its condition of disbursement no later than July 1, 1996, i.e. about one&#13;
year after project effectiveness. Assurances were also received at negotiations that a special review&#13;
of the operations of the Training Funds component would be undertaken after the end of thefirst&#13;
year of operation of that component.&#13;
2.31    A detailed description of the Training Funds component is provided in Annex 11.&#13;
D. Participatory Approach to Project Preparation&#13;
2.32    The involvement of the Ugandan counterparts in all aspects of project processing has been&#13;
an integral part of the capacity building envisaged under the project. The involvement began&#13;
upstream; the sector work was prepared by GOU, IDA and other interested donors in a&#13;
collaborative manner.  Subsequently, IDA  also financed GOU's activities related to the&#13;
establishment of the Capacity Building Secretariat and the preparation of the Capacity Building&#13;
Plan. Upon the commencement of project preparation, GOU appointed a team (headed by a Task&#13;
Manager) which has been responsible for all aspects of project preparation and which will also be&#13;
responsible for project implementation. The GOU team has representatives from all the Ministries&#13;
involved in the project (i.e. Ministries of Finance and Economic Planning; Public Service; Local&#13;
Government; and Justice and Constitutional Affairs) and from the Institute of Certified Public&#13;
Accountants of Uganda. Appraisal commenced with the arrival of this team in Washington D.C.&#13;
in June 1994 and was completed with the visit of the IDA project team to Uganda in August 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
The Ugandan team, having been substantially involved in the preparation of the Yellow Cover Staff&#13;
Appraisal Report, participated in the Bank's (Yellow Cover) Review Meeting held in November&#13;
1994.&#13;
E. Project Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
2.33    The program cost is estimated at US$42.19 million equivalent (U Sh 38.99 billion)&#13;
inclusive of US$1.85 million of taxes and duties, out of which the proposed credit would finance&#13;
US$36.35 million equivalent. The foreign exchange component of the program is estimated at&#13;
44% of the total cost. Base cost estimates, US$36.29 million are in August 1994 prices. Physical&#13;
contingencies on the project are estimated at US$2.91 million (8% of project costs). Price&#13;
contingencies are estimated at US$2.99 million (8% of project costs); for foreign costs, the Unit&#13;
Value Index of Manufactured Exports (MUV Index) of 2.2 per cent has been utilized and for local&#13;
costs, projected local inflation rates have been utilized. The project is expected to be completed&#13;
by June 30, 2000 and close by December 31, 2000.&#13;
2.34    A summary of estimated costs is presented in the following table:&#13;

Total PROJECT COSTS                 23.67  18.52   42.19   44%&#13;
Note: Figures may not add due to rounding.&#13;
2.35    Government Counterpart Funds.  The proposed IDA credit of US$36.35 million&#13;
equivalent will finance 90% of project costs net of duties and taxes over a four-year period. The&#13;
local contribution made by Government will be for an estimated amount of US$4.88 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
2.36    As part of a Public Expenditure Review process which commenced in 1992, Government&#13;
has been classifying all development projects into core and non-core categories. Core projects are&#13;
expected to receive full funding for the estimated local counterpart contributions on a monthly&#13;
basis. Over the last two years, this system has worked well. In FY94, for example, core projects&#13;
received on average 93 % of their local counterpart funds. Since the proposed project is expected&#13;
to be classified in the core category due to its priority nature, it is expected to receive its budgeted&#13;
local funds in their entirety. At negotiations, assurances were received that GOU would establish&#13;
project accounts into which it would make the required local cost contributions to the project&#13;
through its established system of monthly release of-funds. GOU depositing the Uganda Shilling&#13;
equivalent of US$50,000 into the project accounts is a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
2.37    Private Sector Contribution. The private sector will participate in the financing of the&#13;
project in the training component. Under Fund I, private sector institutions receiving training for&#13;
their employees will contribute 50% of the cost of the training. Under Fund II, institutions&#13;
receiving strengthening will fund 10 per cent of training of trainers, 50 per cent of study materials&#13;
and books and 75 per cent of cost of equipment. The private sector will contribute US$0.96&#13;
million of financing towards the project.&#13;
2.38    Parallel Financing. There are several donor initiatives which will run parallel to this&#13;
project and for which close coordination is being undertaken. DANIDA has projects which support&#13;
the Government's decentralization program and also a project to provide support to the judiciary.&#13;
ODA has programs supporting the judiciary, records management in the Central Government and&#13;
is committed to funding printing of the Revised Laws of Uganda. UNDP will finance some&#13;
elements of the Civil Service Reform Program and is preparing a project for building capacity of&#13;
Community Based Groups. USAID plans to finance the law revision activities which will constitute&#13;
preparation of the Revised Laws of Uganda.&#13;
2.39    The proposed financing plan is set out in the following table:&#13;
Table 2: Financing Plan (in US$ million)&#13;

IDA                      36.35&#13;

Private Sector           0.96&#13;
Total                    42.19&#13;
F. Project Implementation&#13;
2.40    The primary modality for implementation is to utilize existing government staff and&#13;
structures. Where external assistance would be sought, the first recourse would be to the local&#13;
consulting industry. If an assessment were made that the domestic capability was not available to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
implement the project, international firms would be invited to participate in project implementation,&#13;
preferably in a consortium with a domestic firm.&#13;
2.41    Overall Coordination, Administration and Supervision. The overall management structure&#13;
for implementation and supervision of the project is shown in Annex 6. Coordination and&#13;
supervision of project components will be the responsibility of the Project Steering Committee&#13;
(PSC). The PSC which is to be established within sixty days after credit effectiveness, will be&#13;
chaired by the Permanent Secretary/Secretary to the Treasury and also consist of the Permanent&#13;
Secretary, Ministry of Local Government; Permanent Secretary/Solicitor General; Secretary to the&#13;
Administrative Reform Commission, Ministry of Public Service; and the President of the Institute&#13;
of Certified Public Accountants of Uganda. A Technical Committee, which has been established&#13;
for project preparation, will continue to be responsible for project implementation and will report&#13;
to the Project Steering Committee. The Technical Committee would be chaired by the GOU Task&#13;
Manager and its membership would consist of the Component Managers for all five components.&#13;
The Capacity Building Secretariat will be the unit supporting the Technical Committee.&#13;
2.42    The project administration structure closely mirrors existing structures within&#13;
Government. Hence, the staff in MPS involved with the Civil Service Reform program would&#13;
manage the Central Government Capacity Building component and those involved with the&#13;
Decentralization Program in the MLG would manage the Local Government Capacity Building&#13;
component. For the Training Funds and Accountancy Strengthening components, existing staff and&#13;
structures are utilized but, taking into account their current lack of capacity, the project undertakes&#13;
to strengthen these further.  The Legal Sector Reform component is the only one where a&#13;
coordinating mechanism is being created in the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs to&#13;
undertake the substantive management and coordination of assistance being provided to various&#13;
entities in the legal sector.&#13;
2.43    Each component will have a Component Manager who will be responsible for supervising&#13;
the substantive aspects of the project. To help the Component Managers and the Project Office&#13;
fulfil their roles effectively, a draft Implementation Manual was prepared as part of the appraisal&#13;
process and the initial draft of the Implementation Manual for the project including Action Plans&#13;
for all components were received by IDA prior to negotiations. The receipt by IDA of a revised&#13;
draft of the Implementation Manual including Action Plans for all components was a condition of&#13;
Board presentation. The receipt by IDA of thefinal satisfactory Implementation Manual and Action&#13;
Plans for all components for thefirst year of the project is a condition of credit effectiveness. This&#13;
Manual would contain: all agreed task (including TORs, procurement items and training needed&#13;
to implement the tasks) and procurement, consultancy and training procedures; implementation&#13;
timetables; and formats for quarterly reporting and annual work plans/programs. Assurances were&#13;
received at negotiations that the project would be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
Implementation Manual, satisfactory to IDA, including Action Plans for all components.&#13;
Assurances were also received that, commencing from the second year of project imnplementation,&#13;
the Action Plans would be refined and submitted to IDA as annual work plans (including training&#13;
plans) no later than the first dav of April preceding the financial year covered in the work plan.&#13;
2.44    The CBS will have a dual role in the project. It will manage the Training Funds&#13;
component and will also act as the main project office for the project. The Project Office for the&#13;
Economic and Financial Management Project will be integrated into the CBS and will provide the&#13;
administrative support for the project. Given that this office has successfully dealt with three IDA&#13;
projects over the last several years it has a substantial base of knowledge regarding IDA's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
procurement and disbursement procedures that will allow project implementation to have an almost&#13;
negligible start-up learning curve. A Project Administration group has been established within the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government and is undergoing training with the objective of developing a&#13;
capacity within that Ministry to manage future district level projects including the proposed IDA&#13;
District Development Project (FY97), and to disseminate good procurement practices in the&#13;
districts. This group would be twinned with the CBS Project Office and it would learn through&#13;
on-the-job training; it would initially undertake project administration functions under the guidance&#13;
of the main (i.e. CBS) Project Office and subsequently undertake these independently. A consistent&#13;
overall approach will be followed to ensure that project records and accounts are maintained and&#13;
audited in a consolidated manner.&#13;
2.45    In line with ensuring appropriate integration among projects, IDA supervision for both&#13;
the ICB and the EFM Projects will be undertaken by the same Task Manager. The Task Manager&#13;
will be supported by a multi-disciplinary team in supervising the project. The Resident Mission&#13;
would be involved in project supervision on an as needed basis at the request of the IDA or GOU&#13;
Task Managers for the project.  Further, during one of the two yearly supervision missions, a&#13;
donor coordination meeting would be organized by GOU and would be attended by IDA and&#13;
donors to review the progress of the project.&#13;
2.46    The administrative activities to be supported under the project would be largely in the&#13;
CBS and the Project Office of the MLG; some activities would be supported in the rest of the&#13;
components. The main administrative responsibilities to be handled by the CBS or the MLG&#13;
Project office, as appropriate, in consultation with the component managers would be:  (a)&#13;
recruitment and employment of consultants, individuals as well as firms, as requested by&#13;
component managers; (b) procurement of goods, computers, vehicles, office equipment;&#13;
(c) management of project accounts and special accounts, including preparation and presentation&#13;
of withdrawal and replenishment applications for the credit proceeds. In addition, the GOU Task&#13;
Manager would: (a) ensure that quarterly reports are prepared by the component managers,&#13;
discussed by the Technical Committee, and then forwarded to IDA; (b) provide assistance to&#13;
component managers for the preparation of yearly work plans; and (c) manage the secretariat&#13;
function for the Technical and Steering Commnittees.&#13;
G. Procurement&#13;
2.47    Procurement would be undertaken by the main project office in the CBS and the program&#13;
office which has been established in MLG as discussed in para. 2.44. There is sufficient capacity&#13;
to undertake procurement in the CBS project office which will include staff currently administering&#13;
the EFM project and who had earlier been involved with implementation of two other IDA&#13;
financed Technical Assistance projects in Uganda (the Second and Third Technical Assistance&#13;
Projects).&#13;
2.48    The following civil works, goods, works and services would be procured: (a) under the&#13;
Central Government Capacity building component, the major services procured would be short-&#13;
term consultancies and in-country training. Office equipment would be procured and the National&#13;
Records Center would be constructed and furbished with appropriate records management&#13;
equipment; (b) under the Local Government Capacity building component, major services procured&#13;
would be for in-country training and some consultancy studies, minor refurbishment of district&#13;
administration offices would be undertaken and vehicles and office equipment and furnishings&#13;
provided to local governments; (c) under the Legal Sector Reform component, major services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
procured would be for preparation of the Law Reports and Law Reform activities. Vehicles and&#13;
office equipment would also be provided to the MJCA and the Judiciary; (d) under the&#13;
Accountancy Strengthening component, major services procured would be a twinning arrangement&#13;
with another Accountancy Association and training for members; (e) under the Training Funds&#13;
component, major services procured would be training from local suppliers. Equipment and&#13;
training materials would also be acquired through the Training Supplier Strengthening Fund.&#13;
2.49    Bank Group Guidelines would be followed for procurement of goods and consultants and&#13;
experts for technical assistance. Specifically:&#13;
(a) Prior Review. All consulting contracts with firms and procurement of civil works and&#13;
goods over US$50,000 would be subject to prior review. Consulting contracts with&#13;
individuals would be subject to prior review over US$30,000.&#13;
(b) Method of Procurement&#13;
(i)   Contracts for computers, vehicles and office equipment would be combined into&#13;
minimum packages of US$100,000 and awarded on the basis of international&#13;
competitive bidding, in accordance with World Bank guidelines.&#13;
(ii)  Items which cannot be grouped as above valuing less than US$100,000 will be&#13;
procured by local competitive bidding. For civil works, the aggregate amounts&#13;
thus procured would be less than US$1,370,000; for goods, the aggregate amounts&#13;
would be less than US$550,000; and for printing, the aggregate amounts would&#13;
be less than US$660,000.&#13;
(iii) Local shopping (i.e. contracts awarded on the basis of a comparison of price&#13;
quotations obtained from at least three suppliers) would be undertaken for items&#13;
or groups of items for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$25,000 or less&#13;
per contract. For goods thus procured, the aggregate amounts would be less than&#13;
US$240,000 and for printing, the aggregate amounts thus procured would be less&#13;
than US$740,000.&#13;
(iv) All International Competitive Bidding and contracts for internationally recruited&#13;
consultants will follow the Bank's standard bidding and contracting procedures.&#13;
(c) Procurement of training services under the Training Funds component would follow&#13;
IDA's consultant guidelines. Details are provided in Annex 11.&#13;
In order to ensure that actions on procurement and consultancy activities are advanced at the time&#13;
of credit effectiveness, draft bidding documents and Letters of Invitation for all major contracts for&#13;
thefirst year's program were provided as a condition of Board presentation. Assurances were also&#13;
provided at negotiations that standard procurement/consultancy recruitment processing timetables&#13;
and documents would be utilized during project implementation. The Table overleaf sunmmarizes&#13;
the major types of procurement to be undertaken in the project.&#13;

H. Disbursements&#13;
2.50    The proposed credit will fund:&#13;
(a) 90 per cent of costs for civil works;&#13;
(b) 100 per cent of foreign and 90 per cent of local costs for goods except under the Training&#13;
Funds component where: (i) 50 per cent of the cost of training materials and books&#13;
acquired under Fund II; and (ii) 25 per cent of the cost of equipment acquired under&#13;
Fund II would be financed;&#13;
(c) 100 per cent of foreign and 95 percent of local costs under consultancy services and&#13;
training except under the Training Funds component where: (i) for public sector training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
acquired under Fund I and staff training under Fund II, 90 per cent of costs would be&#13;
financed; (ii) for private sector training under Fund 1, 50 per cent of costs would be&#13;
financed;&#13;
(d) 50 per cent of costs for printing; and&#13;
(e) 20 per cent of foreign and local costs for project staff operating costs and other operating&#13;
costs.&#13;
2.51    The Standard Disbursement Profile for Technical Assistance credits is for a period of&#13;
seven years. The experience with the management of Technical Assistance projects in Uganda&#13;
shows a shorter disbursement profile which has been utilized for the proposed project. The Third&#13;
Technical Assistance Project disbursed in slightly over five years thereby being fully disbursed two&#13;
years ahead of the project closing date. The Economic and Financial Management Project has&#13;
disbursed 43% of the credit proceeds during the first two years of project implementation. The&#13;
proposed project finances activities which are to be implemented largely within the first three years&#13;
of project implementation. Hence, the five year disbursement schedule presented in the Table&#13;
below consists of a conservative projection of disbursement patterns.&#13;

I. Accounting, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
2.52    Management of Project Funds. Funds for the smooth operation of the project would be&#13;
managed through several types of accounts as described below:&#13;
(a) Two Special Accounts would be established in US dollars in a commercial bank in&#13;
Kampala, on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA as follows:&#13;
(i)   One Special Account of US$1,000,000 would support activities for all components&#13;
other than the Local Government Capacity Building component. Funds from this&#13;
Account could be advanced to two other Accounts for the use of the Ministry of&#13;
Public Service and the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, both of&#13;
which are likely to have operational expenses that would necessitate quick access&#13;
to funds. The two Ministries would provide an accounting of expenditures on a&#13;
monthly basis in order to facilitate the monthly requests for replenishment of the&#13;
main Special Account. This procedure is already in use between the EFM Project&#13;
Office and the Ministry of Public Service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
(ii)  One Special Account of US$500,000 would support activities for the Local&#13;
Government Capacity Building component.&#13;
(iii) The Special Accounts would be replenished on the basis of monthly withdrawal&#13;
requests covering aggregated monthly expenditures.  Payments of less than&#13;
US$50,000 for works and goods contracts and for consultancy contracts with firms&#13;
and payments of less than US$30,000 for consultancy contracts with individuals&#13;
would be documented through statements of expenditure, with the underlying&#13;
documentation available for inspection by IDA supervision missions.&#13;
(b) Government's local contributions to the project costs would be made into four project&#13;
accounts established at a local commercial bank.&#13;
(c) In order to ensure clear responsibilities for funds management, funds accessed directly&#13;
from the IDA Credit would be withdrawn and managed only by the main project office&#13;
in the CBS.&#13;
(d) Funds from both IDA and GOU would be managed to cover project expenditures in&#13;
accordance with the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) disbursement categories and&#13;
the percentage of reimbursement.&#13;
2.53    The Implementation Manual contains details regarding the methodology to be observed&#13;
in maintaining project accounts. The form of the audit and the Terms of Reference for annual&#13;
financial (and operational) audits by independent auditors, satisfactory to IDA are also included.&#13;
At negotiations, assurances were received that financial and operational audits would be&#13;
undertaken annually during project implementation; the format of the audit report would be&#13;
satisfactory to IDA; and audited accounts would be submitted to IDA within six months of the close&#13;
of the financial year.&#13;
2.54    Reporting.  Reports on project implementation, summarizing progress achieved,&#13;
difficulties encountered and changes and adjustments to be made would be submitted quarterly by&#13;
each participating agency to the Chairperson of the Technical Committee, through the Capacity&#13;
Building Secretariat. The Committee would meet at least once a quarter to review progress, make&#13;
appropriate decisions and assign responsibilities for any needed follow up action. The agenda and&#13;
the minutes of the meetings would be the responsibility of the GOU Task Manager and would be&#13;
transmitted to IDA, each quarter, after appropriate internal clearances, to assist with project&#13;
supervision. The Annual Work Program for the next FY and the Annual Report on Project&#13;
Performance for the previous FY would be considered by the Project Steering Committee, after&#13;
endorsement by the Technical Committee. The Project Steering Committee would meet at least&#13;
once every year and endorse/approve the reports prior to onward transmission to IDA. A final&#13;
implementation completion report would be prepared by GOU during the final semester preceding&#13;
project completion.&#13;
2.55    Reviews. At negotiations, assurances were received that GOU and IDA would jointly&#13;
conduct a mid-term review for the project within 18 months after project effectiveness but not later&#13;
than December 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
J. Supervision Plan&#13;
2.56    The resources required for supervision will tend to be above average since a multi-&#13;
disciplinary team (consisting of, in addition to the Task Manager, a public sector management&#13;
specialist, a local govermnent finance specialist, an accountant, a lawyer and a training specialist)&#13;
would be required. As shown in Annex 5, staff (including consultant) input will be needed for&#13;
approximately twenty four person weeks in the field per annum. At headquarters, upfront effort&#13;
will be required which will diminish over the life of the project; approximately an additional twenty&#13;
four weeks will be required at Headquarters during the first year of project implementation,&#13;
diminishing to eighteen weeks in the second year and reducing further to twelve weeks thereafter.&#13;
K. Environmental Impact&#13;
2.57    The project objectives and implementation will have no direct impact on the environment.&#13;
Minor civil works to be undertaken under the project will consist of building refurbishment.&#13;
L. Benefits and Risks&#13;
2.58.   Sustainability.  The project has been designed to support the key elements of&#13;
Government's reform agenda (i.e. civil service reform, decentralization and private sector&#13;
development) and the project components consequently are all considered necessary and have&#13;
linkages between them. GOU has prepared a Letter of Policy with regard to the various sectors&#13;
being assisted under the project which summarizes the above policy and legal framework (Annex&#13;
1). The receipt of a draft Letter of Policy containing GOU'sproposedpoliciesfor the sectors being&#13;
covered under the project was a condition of negotiation and receipt of the final Letter of Policy&#13;
was a condition of Board presentation. The overarching policy framework within which the&#13;
project is set is the GOU Policy on Technical Assistance and the GOU Capacity Building Plan.&#13;
Further: (a) the Central Government Capacity Building component supports GOU's Civil Service&#13;
Reform program which was defined by the PSRRC and for which an administrative structure has&#13;
been in place for a few years now; (b) the Local Government Capacity Building component&#13;
supports GOU's decentralization program as enacted in the Local Governments (Resistance&#13;
Councils) Statute of November 1993 and for which also an administrative structure is in place; and&#13;
(c) the Accountancy Strengthening component supports implementation of the Accountants Statute&#13;
of 1992. The project activities are also expected to be financially sustainable. In the Central&#13;
Government component, the project will assist in further rationalizing of the staffing complement&#13;
and assist in developing new policies for non-staffing operational expenditures. For the Local&#13;
Government component, the project will improve resource mobilization and management. In the&#13;
Legal Sector component, cost recovery for the Administrator-General and Registrar-General will&#13;
be an area of focus. For the Training Funds component, which is a pilot program, financial&#13;
sustainability would need to be addressed at a later stage if the concept is successful in&#13;
implementation.&#13;
2.59    Benefits. The project is expected to provide the following sustainable benefits. In the&#13;
area of public administration, the project would begin to focus the civil service on service delivery&#13;
and measurement of outputs provided to the public at large. There would also be increased&#13;
transparency in salary administration and increased accountability. The project would begin the&#13;
process of redressing the critical skill shortages in the accountancy and legal areas. These changes,&#13;
and those that will result from improvements in the commercial code and the operation of the&#13;
Judiciary should provide a stronger base for private sector development.  Additionally, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
emphasis on implementation skills and increased service delivery at the district/rural level, should&#13;
have a long term beneficial impact on the poor.&#13;
2.60    Risks. The underlying assumptions/risks are: (a) GOU's reform agenda will remain&#13;
unchanged in the medium-term and that the project is sustainable since it supports and is consistent&#13;
with GOU policy and legal frameworks for the sectors concerned; and (b) other measures being&#13;
undertaken outside of this project to support the CSR program will continue (i.e. the move towards&#13;
the Minimum Living Wage and the voluntary and involuntary retrenchment programs which have&#13;
been supported by donors). Other risks relate to decentralization which will relieve pressures on&#13;
limited capacities in the Central Government in the medium-term but in the short-term will&#13;
exacerbate pressures on the Central Government agencies implementing the reform. Finally, while&#13;
the disputes in the accountancy profession have been sorted out prior to commencement of the&#13;
project, some risks remain that a future recurrence may delay implementation of that component.&#13;
2.61    The project includes a considered program for mitigating some risks and maintaining&#13;
active supervision to redress problems should any of the considered risks arise.  First, in&#13;
recognition of the fact that the decentralization agenda is substantial and evolving, provision has&#13;
been made for a flexible approach to providing consultancy support for specific activities and also&#13;
for acquiring expert assistance on an as-and-when-needed-basis for the entire life of the credit.&#13;
Second, implementation risks would be monitored by the GOU team which has sufficient capacity&#13;
to address emerging issues. The project administration staff and staff involved with implementation&#13;
of two of the largest components have had previous experience dealing with IDA projects. Third,&#13;
IDA staff will maintain close liaison through a multi-disciplinary team which would be used to&#13;
supervise the project and Resident Mission staff would also be involved in project supervision on&#13;
an as-needed basis at the request of the IDA or GOU Task Managers for the project.&#13;

Dear Mr Vice President                                       _&#13;
Letter of Policy on Indigenous Capacity Buildct (&#13;
i=.   I am writing on behalf of the Government of the Republic of&#13;
Uganda to indicate Government's policy on indigenous institutional&#13;
capacity building in support of developing and implementing public&#13;
policy decisions and enhancing the growth of the private sector.&#13;
This letter also describes the actions that Government will&#13;
undertake to implement the proposed Institutional Capacity Building&#13;
Project (ICBP).&#13;
2.   I am very grateful for your initiative to bring both donors&#13;
and Sub Saharan African (SSA) Governments to focus on the urgent&#13;
need to address the issue of indigenous capacity building more&#13;
seriously and with a new approach. I am also happy to note that in&#13;
the spirit of your initiative, the process of preparing the ICBP&#13;
has been used to develop capacity for project design, understanding&#13;
of IDA's process for reviewing project design and significant&#13;
project ownership among the implementing agencies. I believe the&#13;
process has been extremely beneficial for us and look forward to&#13;
other IDA projects in Uganda being developed in a similar&#13;
participatory manner.&#13;
Background&#13;
3.   As you are aware, since May 1987, Uganda has been undertaking&#13;
macro-economic reforms.   Simultaneously,  several key structural&#13;
reforms with considerable synergy have also been undertake i.e&#13;
constitutional reform, civil service reform, decentralization to&#13;
local governments, public enterprise reform and private sector&#13;
development. All these activities have required considerable local&#13;
capacity.    Consequently,  activities  aimed  at  improving  the&#13;
cerformance of key economic management agencies and as well as&#13;
support to the main educational institutions in the country, were&#13;
undertaken although they have been going on only with limited&#13;
success. In many cases, resort to foreign experts to fill existing&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -                            Annex 1&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
manpower gaps did not provide for adequate sustainability to ensure&#13;
future availability of indigenous human resources and promotion of&#13;
local initiatives. The technical assistance provided by donors in&#13;
the past has not generated sufficient capacity to further develop,&#13;
manage and implement Government policies and push private sector&#13;
growth.   Indeed the private sector was not targeted for such&#13;
assistance and only benefitted from public sector human and&#13;
institutional resource development by attracting the best manpower&#13;
on account of better remuneration.&#13;
4.   Capacity building in the civil service first began through the&#13;
Civil Service Reform (CSR) program. Recognizing that the lack of&#13;
capacity in Uganda could as much be attributed to the lack of&#13;
sufficient remuneration and proper incentives as to the absence of&#13;
skilled staff, we began an aggressive effort to increase&#13;
remuneration in the Civil Service. We were constrained by the lack&#13;
of revenues collected by Government and, of necessity, increasing&#13;
salaries meant reducing the total complement of staff through&#13;
rationalizing Ministerial structures. Even as the CSR program was&#13;
being implemented, Uganda began a systemic evaluation of its&#13;
approach to Technical Assistance and also began determining, in&#13;
addition to the overall CSR program, the priority areas upon which&#13;
we would need to focus.&#13;
Overall Policy&#13;
5.   Our efforts culminated in Uganda's Policy on Technical&#13;
Assistance issued in May 1993 and the Capacity Building Plan&#13;
prepared in February 1994.   The major objectives of technical&#13;
assistance in Uganda, as stated in the Technical Assistance Policy,&#13;
which constitute the principles on which the ICB project was&#13;
designed include: (a) the establishment or strengthening of both&#13;
public  and  private  institutions  capable  of  implementing  or&#13;
facilitating   implementation   of   Government's   economic   and&#13;
development policies and strategies; (b) the development of human&#13;
resources to produce a skilled labor force, to staff and manage&#13;
these institutions; (c) the efficient use of both domestic and&#13;
external financial and human resources to enhance prospects for&#13;
development; (d) the reversal of the brain drain by mobilizing and&#13;
motivating available national manpower; (e) the transfer of&#13;
appropriate technology (f) the national execution of projects&#13;
supplemented by the use of local consultants and expatriates; and&#13;
(g) the extension of technical assistance to the private sector,&#13;
including Non-Governmental Organizations.&#13;
6.   To achieve the objectives listed in the Policy, a strategic&#13;
approach for the development of local expertise and institutions is&#13;
required including (a) provision of incentives to mobilize and&#13;
encourage the development of national expertise. Such incentives&#13;
would need to include financial packages and working tools and&#13;
facilities (b) promotion of employment of national experts and&#13;
consultants;  (c)  strengthening  of  the  role  of  counterpart&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;

personnel; (d) allowing for the management and execution of project&#13;
activities by Government and under existing government structures;&#13;
and  (e) provision for local staff development and training at&#13;
national (public or private) training institutions and utilizing as&#13;
much as possible local expertise.&#13;
7.   The Uganda Capacity Building Plan identified areas requiring&#13;
attention in a longer term capacity building action program,&#13;
developed an overall institutional framework that will help in the&#13;
implementation of the program and provided a guide to donors in&#13;
their contributions towards capacity building initiatives.   The&#13;
priority areas identified for capacity building activities include:&#13;
(a) policy formation/analysis in government, starting with economic&#13;
policy; (b) manpower planning function and linking manpower&#13;
planning to the training function; (c) the legal and judicial&#13;
system; (d) role and contribution of women to policy development&#13;
and management; (e) local management training institutions; (f)&#13;
policy analysis outside Government; (g) the accountancy profession;&#13;
(h) the local consulting profession; (i) technical and vocational&#13;
education and industrial training capacity; (j) Non-Government&#13;
Organizations in their role as capacity builders for Community&#13;
Based Groups; and (k) the return of skilled expatriate Ugandans.&#13;
8.   As noted above, both the Technical Assistance and the Capacity&#13;
Building Plan emphasize the need to invest in creation of more&#13;
domestic managerial, technical and analytical human resources for&#13;
effective management of economic development in Uganda. We have&#13;
maintained this focus in the proposed project's emphasis on&#13;
increasing the country's ability to build its indigenous resources&#13;
base.&#13;
Institutional Capacity Building Project&#13;
9.   A number of the priority areas identified in the Plan are&#13;
already  receiving attention  from  IDA  and other donors.    In&#13;
preparing this project, special attention has been taken to avoid&#13;
duplication  of  efforts  with  other  donors    and  to  exploit&#13;
complementarity.   Further, the project builds on the successful&#13;
accomplishments of previous and ongoing IDA Technical Assistance&#13;
projects (i.e the Second and Third Technical Assistance Projects&#13;
and the ongoing Economic and Financial Management Project).  The&#13;
proposed project would address the areas of improving the&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of Government operations under Central&#13;
and Local Governments, legal education and reform, strengthening&#13;
the accountancy profession and implementation skills training.&#13;
Strengthening Public Administration&#13;
10. The ongoing Civil Service Reform has arrested further decline&#13;
in the management of the Uganda Civil Service which was caused by&#13;
the past years of conflict and the attendant general mismanagement&#13;
of the economy.   While significant progress has been recorded,&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34 -                              Annex 1&#13;

several issues are yet to be dealt and these include (a)&#13;
insufficient pay and benefits; (b)inadequate, personnel management;&#13;
(c)an inadequate code of conduct for public officers; and (d)&#13;
inadequate facility management and maintenance culture.&#13;
11.  The project will continue support to the management of the&#13;
Civil Service Reform Program, through strengthening of the central&#13;
personnel management, records management, facility and asset&#13;
management and introduction of Results Oriented Management (ROM)&#13;
and performance recognition system, to improve on service delivery.&#13;
In line with our current approach which was discussed earlier, we&#13;
are committed to increasing remuneration to civil Service staff by&#13;
containing and reducing the total number of Civil Service staff. We&#13;
have reached agreement with IDA staff on the process to be used for&#13;
setting annual targets for Civil Service staff for each of the&#13;
fiscal years of project implementation, as part of the standard&#13;
process for consultations with IDA on public expenditure, including&#13;
the annual wage bill. These figures would be closely monitored and&#13;
would be updated annually on a three year rolling basis.&#13;
12.  We are committed to using the assistance received through the&#13;
proposed project to further streamline the Civil Service, improve&#13;
transparency and accountability and promote effective and efficient&#13;
service delivery.   In this regard we plan to:  (a)  implement a&#13;
revised salary structure commencing from July 1996; (b) issue a&#13;
Code of Conduct for all Civil Servants by July 1996 and monitor its&#13;
implementation thereafter; (c) undertake annual measurement of&#13;
Central  and  local  Government  outputs   and  service  delivery&#13;
commencing from July 1996 and introduce Results Oriented Management&#13;
into our budgeting procedures for use from the 1996/97 budget&#13;
cycle;    and  (d)  introduce  Facility Management  Policy into  our&#13;
budgeting procedures for use from the 1997/98 budget cycle.&#13;
13.  With  decentralization,  the  Local  Governments   (Resistance&#13;
Councils) Statute of November 1993 gave the responsibility for&#13;
provision of most services to the local governments.   However, it&#13;
is already clear that the state of physical facilities and the&#13;
inadequacy of the required skills would impede a successful&#13;
transition of service delivery from central to district management.&#13;
14.  The project will assist us in defining and implementing an&#13;
appropriate  system of  inter-governmental  finance.    We  plan  to&#13;
complete a study of the decentralization of the development budget&#13;
by June 1996 and commence implementation of the decentralization of&#13;
the development budget in a phased manner by July 1997.   We also&#13;
plan to complete a study to determine establishment of the District&#13;
Development Fund by June 1996 and issue a position statement on the&#13;
findings of the study by December 1996.&#13;
15.  The project will also strengthen local government financial&#13;
and personnel management structures, systems and procedures;&#13;
improve service delivery through introduction of ROM to local&#13;
4&#13;

government and provide basic tools and facilities for the district&#13;
administration offices.   Due to the assistance received under the&#13;
project, our local government will be able to: (a) prepare and have&#13;
audited local government accounts within the six months time limit&#13;
prescribed  in  Local  Governments  (Resistance  Councils)  Statute,&#13;
1993.    This  will  be phased  over  time  with  thirteen  districts&#13;
commencing in March 1995, twenty seven districts commencing in&#13;
March 1996 and for all districts commencing in March 1997; and (b)&#13;
computerize their payrolls including for staff formerly employed by&#13;
the Central Government.   Initially (i.e. by July 1995) this would&#13;
be achieved using Uganda Computer Services as an agent and from&#13;
July  1996  onwards,  would  be  undertaken  by  local  government&#13;
themselves with a completely decentralized payroll planned for June&#13;
1997.&#13;
Legal Sector Reform&#13;
16.  This area of public administration has a critical impact on&#13;
private sector development.  The flow of assistance to this sector&#13;
has been highly limited and lacked good co-ordination.   Uganda's&#13;
legal system has been underpinned by largely outdated legislation,&#13;
especially for laws regarding commerce, traffic and taxation, which&#13;
affect business, industry and private sector development. There is&#13;
an urgent need for modernization and for tackling the problem of&#13;
inherent weaknesses in the major legal institutions which increases&#13;
the difficulty of enforcement of these Laws.   We have recently&#13;
taken two key steps in this regards.   First, we have significantly&#13;
increased the remuneration of professional legal sector staff.&#13;
Second, we have established the Law Reform Commission to commence&#13;
the process of law reform.   However,  the sector continues to be&#13;
subject to the problems of insufficient staffing (for paralegal and&#13;
support staff), outdated office equipment and technology, the&#13;
absence of pre or in-service training, archaic legislation, out of&#13;
date law documents and the lack of office supplies.&#13;
17.  The proposed project will strengthen the legal framework for&#13;
private sector development, ensure availability of laws and legal&#13;
decisions, strengthen major institutions in the legal sector and&#13;
introduce improvements in legal education and training. A key area&#13;
which we intend to address is the system of legal education.   We&#13;
plan to undertake a legal education study and to provide our&#13;
positions statement on the findings of the study by July 1995.&#13;
Further, with the support received form the project, we plan to.(a)&#13;
by July 1996, publish as Bills (i.e. present to the legislature for&#13;
approval) the laws to be reformed to provide an impetus to private&#13;
sector development; and (b) by July 1998, publish the Law Reports&#13;
for the period 1958-1995. IDA and Government have agreed on the&#13;
laws to be reformed and in line with this agreement a comprehensive&#13;
listing has been forwarded to Washington.   Finally,  we plan to&#13;
pilot the introduction of cost recovery into the legal sector by&#13;
increasing the level of revenues as a percentage of costs for the&#13;
Departments of the Res:strar General and the Administrator General&#13;
and Public Trustee.&#13;

Accountancy Development                                     Page 6 of 7&#13;
18. Government's commitment to sound financial management, full&#13;
accountability,   improved  business  ethics  and  improved  tax&#13;
compliance for the growing private sector have resulted in a very&#13;
high  demand  for  accountants   and  accounting  technicians.&#13;
Considering the small size of the accounting profession in Uganda,&#13;
accounting jobs have been filled by staff with no formal accounting&#13;
qualifications.&#13;
19. The 1992 Accountants Statute established the Institute&#13;
of Certified Accountants of Uganda (ICPAU) to regulate the&#13;
profession and maintain standards and the Public Accountants&#13;
Examination Board (PAEB) to conduct accounting examinations.&#13;
However, the Institute and the Board did not become operational for&#13;
almost two years. We have recently taken steps which have assisted&#13;
the ICPA in holding its first Annual General meeting and electing&#13;
its Governing Council to which I have also appointed a member.&#13;
20. The project would support the development of the ICPAU, the&#13;
establishment of a local professional qualification and examining&#13;
capability and the introduction of local accounting standards. As&#13;
a consequence of the support received under the project, the ICPAU&#13;
will be able to: (a) have its first intake of students for the&#13;
local professional accountancy examinations commencing by September&#13;
1996 and hold the first examinations by June 1997; and (b) publish&#13;
all local accounting and auditing standards by June 1998.&#13;
Implementation Skills Training&#13;
21.    Besides technical skills, general management and&#13;
implementation skills continue to hinder growth and competitiveness&#13;
of the private sector and the effective delivery of services by the&#13;
public sector. It has also been noted that besides donor support&#13;
and limited Government subsidies for a few public institutions,&#13;
there has been no planned development of local institutions.   A&#13;
change from a supply driven to a demand driven approach is urgently&#13;
required to ensure that the required skill needs are met.   In&#13;
addition, Government must plan for development of local training&#13;
institutions to provide the required quantity and quality of the&#13;
training services.&#13;
22. This project would pilot a method of acquiring the training&#13;
needs of public and private sector institutions (which would share&#13;
in the costs of training acquired) from local training suppliers&#13;
through a transparent and competitive bidding process. Assistance&#13;
will also be selectively given to identified weak training&#13;
institutions with potential for improvement, through staff training&#13;
and acquisition of study materials and equipment on a cost sharing&#13;
basis: up to 40 institutions would be assisted in this manner.&#13;

23. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate&#13;
Government's commitment to the implementation of the policies,&#13;
programs and initiatives outlined in this Letter of Policy.  In&#13;
particular, I am referring to the strengthening and greater use of&#13;
local experts and institutions, the demand driven approach to local&#13;
and foreign training,  the government execution of the project&#13;
activities and the extension of assistance.to the private sector,&#13;
all in line with the country's Technical Assistance Policy and the&#13;
Capacity  Building  Plan.    I  must  also  emphasize  that  the&#13;
consolidation of the successes of the country's reform programs is&#13;
highly dependent on the progress in building greater indigenous&#13;
institutional and human capacity to develop and implement public&#13;
policy and support the growth of the private sector.&#13;
24.    On behalf of the Ugandan Government, and on my own behalf,&#13;
I wish to thank IDA for the assistance already provided in the&#13;
field of capacity building and to hope that this request for&#13;
additional assistance through the proposed UICB project will&#13;
receive favourable consideration.&#13;
Yours sincerely,&#13;

UGANDA INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
IDA Supervision Input&#13;
1.    Staff (including consultant) input will be needed for approximately 24 person weeks in the field&#13;
per annum; the composition of the IDA team is listed in the attached Table. At headquarters, upfront&#13;
effort will be required which will diminish over the life of the project; approximately an additional 24&#13;
weeks will be required at Headquarters in year 1, diminishing to 18 weeks in year 2 and reducing further&#13;
to 12 weeks thereafter.  These are financed out of IDA's administrative budget and NOT from the&#13;
proceeds of the project credit.&#13;
Borrower's Contribution to Supervision&#13;
2.    The GOU Task Manager will act as the central link between the component managers and IDA;&#13;
however, direct lines of communications between component mangers and IDA technical staff working&#13;
on each component will also exist.&#13;
3.    Reports on project implementation, summarizing progress achieved, difficulties encountered and&#13;
changes and adjustments to be made would be submitted quarterly by each participating agency to the&#13;
Chairperson of the Technical Committee, through the Capacity Building Secretariat. At a minimum, each&#13;
component report should describe in general terms the status of the component, and deal with the status&#13;
of inputs (i.e. procurement, consultants and training), the process of implementation (i.e. any particular&#13;
problems that may have/be occurring, and the steps being taken to resolve the difficulties) and the outputs&#13;
(i.e. tasks commenced/completed). Further, with regard to both inputs and outputs, the progress towards&#13;
objectives should be quantified as far as possible or where this is not possible compared with the outputs&#13;
listed in Annex 3. Also, some indication should be provided on the objectives for the next quarter, and&#13;
the resources being deployed to meet these targets. As the quarterly report serves not only as a guide for&#13;
progress but as a diagnostic tool for GOU and IDA, it is important for component managers to candidly&#13;
outline their difficulties.&#13;
4.    Prior to each field mission by IDA, the GOU Task Manager will set up a timetable of key&#13;
meetings, as agreed between the Project Manager and the mission leader. The GOU Task Manager will&#13;
also be responsible for notifying all component managers of the dates of missions, and for ensuring the&#13;
availability of component managers/staff for discussions.&#13;
5.    The GOU Task Manager will be responsible with the IDA Task Manager for the organization and&#13;
conduct of the Mid-Term Review. A project evaluation consultant would be appointed to undertake a&#13;
detailed analysis of project implementation and present a draft report to the Government and IDA.&#13;

INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT CAPACITY BUILDING COMPONENT&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The economic mismanagement and political chaos of the 1970s in Uganda severely decimated one&#13;
of the most respected and effective public administrations in Eastern Africa. With migration, Ugandan&#13;
human capacity was further eroded. Through the Economic Recovery Program (ERC) launched by&#13;
government in 1987, the decline in standards and efficiency has largely been arrested. The initial attempts&#13;
at reform focused on reducing the numbers of part time employees and rationalizing the numbers, roles&#13;
and functions of ministries. Then, in October 1990, a policy framework for a comprehensive civil service&#13;
reform was presented by the Public Service Review and Reorganization Commission (PSRRC). The&#13;
Commission's report, which included some 255 specific recommendations, concluded that the Ugandan&#13;
Civil Service had been marked not only by its bloated structure, but also by inefficiency and poor&#13;
performance. Key problems were: inadequate pay and benefits; poor management skills; dysfunctional&#13;
civil service organization; and inadequate personnel management and training. This lead to abuse of&#13;
office and Government property; moonlighting and corruption; lack of discipline; an erosion of rules and&#13;
regulations; obsolete procedures; lack of appropriate systems; thin managerial and technical skills; poor&#13;
public service attitudes; and massive bureaucratic red tape.&#13;
2.    In 1992 the major recommendations of the Commission were adopted as a framework for reform&#13;
through Sessional Paper No. 1. The chosen strategy includes: rationalization and downsizing of the civil&#13;
service, reform of remuneration policy and payroll administration, restructuring of ministries and&#13;
decentralization of governmental functions and development and introduction of improved personnel&#13;
management systems. To date, a number of steps have been taken towards creating a small, well&#13;
motivated and remunerated civil service capable of delivering timely and improved service to the public.&#13;
These achievements include:&#13;
a.    significant real increases in salaries (although salary levels are still far below the Minimum&#13;
Living Wage prescribed by the PSRRC). Further pay reforms including monetization of non-&#13;
monetary benefits, in particular transport and housing, is planned to be implemented&#13;
commencing in fiscal year 1994/95.&#13;
b.     a reduction in the number of ministries from  38 in 1989 to 21 currently, and the&#13;
rationalization of ministerial structures to remove duplications and overlaps as well as to&#13;
reduce encroachment on the private sector.&#13;
c.    significant progress has also been achieved in the removal from the payroll of ghost workers,&#13;
redundant employees, the overaged and the poor performers. 1990 payroll payments were for&#13;
320,000 employees. Following detailed censuses, spot checks, and a concerted effort at&#13;
computerization of the payroll and the development of establishment position codes, the&#13;
Central Government Civil Service staff have been reduced to about 148,000 as of December&#13;
1994.&#13;

Remaining Issues&#13;
3.     As has been noted above, over the last few years, the CSR program has moved on a broad front&#13;
to address several issues which has provided a strong underpinning for Government's continued effort&#13;
at reform. However, given the magnitude of the problems the Government started out with, the following&#13;
items (in each of the areas initially identified by the PSRRC) still remain:&#13;
a. Insufficient Pay and Benefits. Improving basic pay still remains the most important prerequisite&#13;
for a more effective civil service. Even after several successive salary increments since 1986,&#13;
wages and salaries in government are still extremely low compared to the private sector and&#13;
parastatal organizations, and do not come near the Minimum Living Wage proposed by the&#13;
PSRRC. These problems are further exacerbated by major design weaknesses in the current pay&#13;
and grading system which add lack of equity and transparency to the basic issue of low pay.&#13;
Shortcomings include: (i) 64 different grade levels covering all civil service employees; (ii) 76&#13;
different types of allowances paid in the civil service; (iii) progression through the salary scale&#13;
based purely on length of service in the job; (iv) compressed salary structure with a ratio from&#13;
the minimum of the lowest grade to the maximum of the top grade of only 1:6.8; and (v) equally&#13;
uncompressed remuneration structure (i.e. including all non-monetary allowances and benefits)&#13;
of 1:100.&#13;
b. Insufficient Management and Supervisory Skills. The standard or quality of management, as&#13;
distinct from administration, is very low in Public Service and this deficiency constitutes one of&#13;
the most serious obstacles to achievement of modern methods of management. Past training&#13;
efforts in the civil service were not dynamic and innovative enough to effect the much needed re-&#13;
orientation that Uganda's present problems and programs call for. There is also a problem with&#13;
the "culture" of the civil service, which at one time was one of the best in Africa; new&#13;
management techniques which were introduced have not been seriously implemented.&#13;
c. Inadequate Personnel Management and Training.  The personnel management function in&#13;
Uganda's Civil Service is carried out by the Ministry of Public Service; the Public Service&#13;
Commission; line Ministries/ Departments. It has been the Public Service Commission's&#13;
responsibility, in theory, to recruit, terminate and discipline civil service staff. However, in&#13;
reality, for the personnel processes to work, there must be substantial input and cooperation from&#13;
the line ministries. However, due to over-centralization, the service is unable to deal with&#13;
disciplinary cases at their source and when identified, such cases take inordinately long to&#13;
resolve.  The response at the working level has been for managers to simply transfer&#13;
undisciplined civil servants to other sections, ministries or departments.&#13;
d. Lack of an adequate Code of Conduct for Public Officials. While the problems of (and the&#13;
solutions for) administrative inefficiency can be seen in purely technical terms as described above,&#13;
it is clear that administrative failure in Uganda involved far more than technical incompetence.&#13;
It is commonly accepted that the collapse of the 1970s and 1980s was caused by a political&#13;
breakdown rather than inappropriate administrative structures. Military dictatorship destroyed all&#13;
mechanisms of political and financial accountability and thus eliminated effective management,&#13;
monitoring and control. Corruption and malingering were no longer punished but became an&#13;
intrinsic part of the reward system, fully exploited by everyone. The problem was not that&#13;
regulations were outmoded but that existing regulations were systematically abused by managers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
and staff alike. Government became little more than a criminal conspiracy against the public.&#13;
Thus improved performance will not only depend on better training and management systems or&#13;
revised regulations, but on the creation of an accountability system which will expose and punish&#13;
corruption and incompetence and recognize and reward effective performance.&#13;
e. Inadequate Facility Management and Maintenance Culture. The situation found by the PSRRC&#13;
of resource deprivation i.e. Government offices trying to manage without the most basic&#13;
equipment and ordinary office furniture such as chairs, tables, functional typewriters or copying&#13;
equipment has improved but not by much. At that time, the lack of support infrastructure&#13;
reflected the massive looting during the war years. While there has since been a build-up of&#13;
equipment, etc., there continues to remain a poor nmaintenance culture in the service. Inadequate&#13;
attention is paid to the recurring cost implications of acquiring new assets and many buildings&#13;
from which the Civil Service operates are in a poor state of disrepair.&#13;
Previous and Ongoing Assistance&#13;
4.    Previous efforts by Government and related support from donors, in particular UNDP, ODA and&#13;
IDA have, of necessity, focused on restoring efficiency to the core aspects of Government business (e.g.&#13;
planning, budgeting, control of financial and monetary resources) and to get the reform measures&#13;
implemented. The magnitude of the problems and the need to re-establish critical functions required a&#13;
focus on immediate results; this resulted in significant use of expatriate assistance. The situation having&#13;
stabilized, it is now appropriate to widen the focus from short term problem solving to building&#13;
indigenous capacity i.e. lasting systems and skills.&#13;
Program and Component Objectives&#13;
5.    The principal objective is to continue the Civil Service Reform program in support of the&#13;
Government's broader program of reforming and modernizing key public institutions and the personnel&#13;
staffing, thus helping to sustain the economic and social reform program which the government has&#13;
initiated. This would be achieved by further assisting Government in continuing to address the remaining&#13;
key issues in the Civil Service.&#13;
Component Description&#13;
6.    There are several ongoing activities which need to be brought to completion. Also, support needs&#13;
to be provided to understanding and developing the next stage of the reform process. The proposed credit&#13;
will finance a time slice consisting of selected components of the program. Actions to be financed by&#13;
the IDA credit are limited to those which can be effectively completed within the project horizon, and&#13;
which will result in lasting improvements in key areas of civil service performance. It also takes into&#13;
account and supplements existing and forthcoming parallel funding from other donors. The project&#13;
component will concentrate on:&#13;
a. streamlining of the civil service. This includes management of the Civil Service Reform&#13;
program, implementation of the Ministerial Reviews and strengthening Personnel Management&#13;
function in central ministries;&#13;
b. improving the transparency of personnel management through implementation of a new salary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
structure, revision of Standing Orders, introduction of a Code of Conduct and a Performance&#13;
Recognition Program; and&#13;
c. focusing the civil service on effective service delivery through the introduction of Results&#13;
Oriented Management;&#13;
d. focusing the civil service on efficient service delivery through developing the Central&#13;
Government's capability for facility/asset management and records management; and&#13;
e. training for Improved Performance (Skill Building).&#13;
Streamlining the Civil Service&#13;
7.     Support to the streamlining of the civil service would be provided at two levels. First, the overall&#13;
program being managed through the Ministry of Public Service would be supported especially through:&#13;
(i) improving central personnel management systems; and (ii) supporting key bodies and staff undertaking&#13;
a civil- service-wide classification of personnel from the perspective of identifying candidates for&#13;
termination as a result of restructuring/redundancy activities. Second, at the level of individual ministries,&#13;
the project would support: (i) implementation of Ministerial restructuring plans; and (ii) strengthening&#13;
Ministry level personnel management functions.&#13;
8. Improving Central Personnel Management. The improvements made so far in the central government&#13;
need to be further consolidated through improvements in central systems, in particular improved&#13;
personnel management practices and accountability. In light of the decentralization program and the&#13;
transfer of several responsibilities to the District Service Committees, it is also necessary to redefine the&#13;
role of the Public Service Commission.  The project would support Technical Assistance for the&#13;
introduction of examinations as a means for selection and staff promotion. The staff of the PSC would&#13;
be trained to take over the administration of examinations at a later date.&#13;
9.     Supporting Key Bodies and Staff. The focus of implementation within MPS has rested with a core&#13;
team of expatriates, national experts and ministry staff. In MPS, the Senior Advisor for Civil Service&#13;
Reform (an expatriate) and two national experts, who provide the necessary technical and advisory&#13;
services, are being supported from ODA funding. In addition to the ongoing management of the reform,&#13;
the increased visibility of the CSR program necessitates its transparency should be improved so that&#13;
various stakeholders are informed on a timely and regular basis about the progress of CSR. This process&#13;
has already begun on a limited basis vis-a-vis the external stakeholders (i.e. the donors and multi-lateral&#13;
agencies); and it now needs to be expanded to include domestic constituencies. The primary modality&#13;
is to strengthen the in-house function in order to able to package and disseminate infornation to all the&#13;
relevant target groups. The credit will be used to procure specialized services and provision of the related&#13;
publicity equipment and publishing of civil service newsletter and other information tools.&#13;
10.   Through the Economic and Financial Management Project, IDA has funded the activities of The&#13;
Implementation and Monitoring Board (TIMB) which screens all civil servants to assess their effectiveness&#13;
and decides on priorities among staff to be retrenched and the Project Implementation Committee (PIC)&#13;
for CSR. This support will continue under the credit which will, as in the past, fund incentives and&#13;
allowances for TIMB and would also provide incentives to critical MPS staff and key staff from other&#13;
central ministries involved in the implementation of the reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
11.   Implementation of Ministerial Reviews.  The first five ministerial restructuring plans (or&#13;
Ministerial Reviews) have been under implementation for some time now. For the balance of sixteen&#13;
ministries/offices, implementation of the restructuring plans is yet to commence or at an early stage. It&#13;
is apparent that the first five ministries are experiencing problems that have hampered the timely&#13;
implementation of the new structures. PIC together with the Inspectorate Department of MPS would&#13;
establish the reasons for the delay in implementation and the results of this assessment would be used to&#13;
design the assistance provided to the Ministries. The nature of the assistance would be tailor-made based&#13;
on the recommended changes in the ministerial reviews, the size, complexity and the current management&#13;
capability of each ministry.  The credit would finance relevant management of change and/or&#13;
implementation capability for each of the remaining sixteen ministries/offices.&#13;
12.   The current restructuring plans of ministries do not take into account the impact of&#13;
decentralization on the operations of various ministries. This assessment can only be made after February&#13;
1995 when the structures and approved establishment positions of the District structural reviews are&#13;
known. At that time, the ministerial restructuring plans would be restructured and revised based on the&#13;
inputs from the Districts. The credit would finance a short term consultancy study to review the outcome&#13;
of all the district reviews and its impact on the role to be performed by the central ministries. The output&#13;
would be a new structure and establishment for the central government.&#13;
13.   Strengthening of the personnel managementfunction in each Ministry. A pilot exercise has already&#13;
been initiated, with assistance from ODA, to develop and install computerized personnel information&#13;
system in five ministries. The credit would finance extending this system to the remaining ministries.&#13;
Improving the Transparency of Personnel Management&#13;
14.   New Salary Structure, Schemes of Service and Salary Administration Manual. Currently, work&#13;
on salary structures is being undertaken with technical assistance funded by UNDP. Simultaneously, job&#13;
grading issues are being addressed by developing a job information database consisting of job&#13;
descriptions, specifications and requirements. This will help introduce fairness and transparency into the&#13;
civil service salary administration and job evaluation. Based on this ongoing work, it is expected that&#13;
by July 1996, GOU would introduce a new salary structure for the Civil Service. At that time, the&#13;
project would assist in developing the corresponding schemes of service as well as a salary administration&#13;
manual to implement the new policies. Subsequently, staff will need to be trained in the use of the Salary&#13;
Administration Manual and the use of the schemes of service in succession planning and staff&#13;
development. To accomplish this, the credit will finance a short term consultant, counterpart training,&#13;
office technology, dissemination of policies and procedures and allowances.&#13;
15.   In order to address the issue of transparency and accountability, the following activities would&#13;
be undertaken:&#13;
a. new Standing Orders and a Code of Conduct for all Civil Servants would be issued by July 1996.&#13;
The credit would support a short term consultancy to revise the Standing Orders, separated by&#13;
the three services, as well as prepare a Code of Conduct.&#13;
b. Design and conduct of trainingfor the MPS Department of Inspection staff. The staff in the newly&#13;
formed MPS Department of Inspection would play a crucial role in the broader monitoring of the&#13;
implementation of the reform program and more specifically on issues of accountability. An&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
inspection guidance manual would be developed for the Department in the execution of its&#13;
functions. This manual will form part of the training materials in inspection techniques and&#13;
methodology. The staff will also be exposed, through study tours, to the experience of other&#13;
countries with strong and effective inspection function. The primary modality will be through a&#13;
short term consultant to develop the inspection manual and provide the initial training in&#13;
inspection techniques and methodology.&#13;
16.   A Performance Recognition Program would be instituted by July 1996 which would recognize&#13;
outstanding performance by groups and individuals in different categories and would in a timely and&#13;
substantial way reward outstanding performance and thereby provide role models for excellent&#13;
performance. The credit would finance a study to establish the program.&#13;
Focus on Effectiveness: Emphasis on Service Delivery/introduction of Result Oriented Management&#13;
17.   A new concept of management would be introduced into the service to make staff more results&#13;
oriented and concentrate their attention and resources on the achievement of definite objectives within&#13;
specified time targets. In applying this concept, objectives and achievement targets would be determined&#13;
for each ministry, department and subordinate unit and for individual officers. To make the technique&#13;
more relevant, the process would be linked to the annual budgeting programming exercise during which&#13;
ministries set and agree with the Treasury on their financing proposals. The introduction of this technique&#13;
of management will comprise of two elements:&#13;
a. To assist in future monitoring of the quantitative indicators which would be developed and&#13;
measured through the Action Planning Workshops, a baseline study would be conducted to&#13;
establish the existing level of service delivery. At the same time, it is also necessary to measure&#13;
the perception of the users regarding changes in service delivery; a survey instrument would be&#13;
developed for use with the baseline study as well as for future annual use from July 1996&#13;
onwards. The credit would finance a short term consultancy and travel in the development of&#13;
the survey instrument.&#13;
b. A series of sensitizing, team building and action planning workshops for all senior managers in&#13;
central government. The output of the workshops would consist of realistic and measurable&#13;
performance standards and indicators by which to measure service delivery to the public from&#13;
each Ministry. Based on the standards and indicators, ROM would be integrated into GOU's&#13;
budgeting procedures from the 1996/97 budgeting cycle.&#13;
Focus on Efficiency: Strengthening Support Services&#13;
18.   Strengthening Records Management. The government, with assistance from ODA, has initiated&#13;
a program to improve records management in central ministries. During the first phase of the program&#13;
(1987-89) registries in five key ministries/departments were rehabilitated, and staff training for staff was&#13;
also provided, and the capacity of the Records and Information Management Department (RIMD), within&#13;
the Ministry of Public Service was improved to provide the necessary technical and advisory services to&#13;
other ministries. The second phase of the program (1994-96) has commenced with another lot of seven&#13;
ministries. The program will assist in establishing a system of providing timely access to information and&#13;
the establishment of an institutional memory. While the registry functions in ministries are being&#13;
addressed, the problem of whether to store semi-active records remains unaddressed. At the moment,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
these semi-active records are being retained in the registries resulting in congestion/overflow thus taking&#13;
up space which is required for current records. This exacerbates the retrieval problems. It is necessary&#13;
to have a purpose built facility where the semi-active records can be sorted out and the historical and&#13;
valuable ones transferred to the Archives. The credit will provide funds to support training and the&#13;
construction of the National Records Centre by June 1997.&#13;
19.   An initial assessment of the space requirements, security requirements and costs has been&#13;
completed by a short-term expert funded from the Project Preparation Facility. This assignment has&#13;
resulted in Terms of Reference for an architectural/engineering firm to design the detailed specifications&#13;
and supervise the actual construction.&#13;
20.   Strengthening Facility and Physical Assets Management. One of the key issues of facilities and&#13;
assets management which remains unaddressed in the Ugandan context is the necessity for preventive&#13;
facilities maintenance. Because of lack of a maintenance capability, the Government incurs substantially&#13;
higher costs for breakdown maintenance in addition to having physical facilities in a state of disrepair.&#13;
A study would be undertaken to develop an optimal approach to ensure facility and asset management,&#13;
and provide training to officer managers, transport officers and other concerned officers. The study&#13;
would review the best approach for managing in-country assets and would facilitate the issuance of the&#13;
necessary policies and recommendations on the implementation of these policies through the budgeting&#13;
processes from the 1997/98 budgeting cycle onwards. It would also review the utilization of Ugandan&#13;
Government assets abroad and recommend the optimal size of assets required and approaches to managing&#13;
those assets.&#13;
Training for Improved Performance (Skill Building)&#13;
21.    Training to Support the Implementation of the CSR program.  A civil service training plan for&#13;
1995/96 has been prepared. It needs to be prioritized to emphasize more problem solving, in-country&#13;
training in critical skill areas. Beyond 1996/97, based on the outcome of the ministerial reviews, a&#13;
complete and integrated Training Needs Assessment (TNA) for the central government would be&#13;
undertaken and a five year Central Government Training Plan would be developed to increase the civil&#13;
servants' ability to deliver timely and high quality services to the public. The TNA and the Training Plan&#13;
will be developed by a short term consultant and approved by the Project Implementation Committee&#13;
(PIC). Most of the training would be problem solving oriented, skill building, and conducted in-country.&#13;
In general, most of the training for the Civil service would be undertaken through the Training Funds&#13;
component of the project. However, Senior Management Training is considered to be a critical activity&#13;
which would be funded under this component. A series of workshops will be conducted to address the&#13;
inadequacy of management and supervisory skills at the senior levels (Permanent Secretaries, Directors&#13;
and Commissioners). The credit would fund a short term consultancy, allowances and training materials&#13;
to run four two weeks seminars for this group of officers.&#13;
Parallel Projects&#13;
22.   In addition to IDA, there are three donors involved with central government capacity building&#13;
i.e. UNDP, ODA and EEC. Other donors (Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, ODA and Sweden)&#13;
have contributed funds for the retrenchment and voluntary retirement schemes being undertaken by GOU.&#13;
23.   UNDP has been supporting the CSR through a project that began in 1991 and is expected to run&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;
Page 8 of 8&#13;
through December 1995. The project's focus has been on several areas included under the proposed&#13;
project i.e. Ministerial Reviews, District Reviews, job evaluation and grading, payroll monitoring,&#13;
training and retrenchment.&#13;
24.   ODA has been financing the service of the Chief Technical Advisor (CTA) since November 1992.&#13;
Following the departure of the CTA, ODA is funding a replacement Senior Advisor and two National&#13;
Advisors. ODA's projects have focused upon: ministerial reviews, records management, personnel&#13;
information system, training (including support to the Uganda Management Institute).&#13;
25.   EEC has begun financing training and equipment through the Human Resources Development&#13;
Progranmme under Lome IV which is being administered by the Ministry of Finance and Economic&#13;
Planning.&#13;
26.   The responsibility for the management and implementation of the Civil Service Reform rests with&#13;
the Office of Secretary to the Administrative Reform Commission. Hence, this office is responsible for&#13;
coordinating donor activities.&#13;

UGANDA INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAPACITY BUILDING COMPONENT&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The local government system in Uganda can be traced back to the structures introduced by the&#13;
British at the turn of the century and then gradually modified over the next sixty years. At independence&#13;
in 1962 the Constitution provided for the devolution of powers to Kingdoms, Urban Councils and District&#13;
Councils.  The 1967 Constitution reversed this system and provided a highly centralized system&#13;
underpinned by the Local Administration Act of 1967. During the 1970s and the early 1980s, there was&#13;
a complete collapse in central-local relations. After taking power in 1986, one of the first goals&#13;
enunciated by the National Resistance Movement Government in its overall framework of social-political&#13;
policy was that of decentralization. In 1987, political decentralization was introduced through the&#13;
Resistance Council system which consisted of a hierarchical structure of Councils and Committees&#13;
consisting of: Village Council (RC1); Parish Council (RC2); Sub-County or Division Council (RC3);&#13;
County or Municipal Council (RC4); and District or City Council (RC5).&#13;
2.    Commencing in 1986, the Government also began studying the issue of decentralization of&#13;
administrative authorities and responsibilities to the thirty nine districts in Uganda to match the RC&#13;
structure. There have been various reports produced over the last seven years including the Report of&#13;
the Commission of Inquiry into Local Government System (1987), Report of the Local Authorities&#13;
Finance Resources Committee (1987), Report of the Public Service Review and Reorganization&#13;
Commission (1990) and Summary Recommendations to Strengthen Democratic Decentralization (1991).&#13;
In 1991, Cabinet considered and approved measures to strengthen democratic decentralization. Also,&#13;
in 1992, a Standing Committee on Decentralization consisting of Permanent Secretaries was established&#13;
and a Decentralization Secretariat set up in the Ministry of Local Government.&#13;
3.    The various studies and recommendations were considered by Government and culminated in the&#13;
Local Governments (Resistance Council) Statute which was enacted by Parliament in November 1993.&#13;
It became effective on December 31,1993. The major changes defined under the Statute (which repeals&#13;
the Local Administrations Act, 1967; the Urban Authorities Act, 1964; and the Resistance Councils and&#13;
Committees Statute, 1987) are&#13;
a. the central headquarters functions would be reduced to policy formulation, planning, inspection&#13;
and the management of the national programs (as defined under the Second Schedule of the&#13;
Statute). All other services (defined in the Sixth Schedule of the Statute) would be provided at&#13;
or below the District level;&#13;
b. for services provided by the Districts, Central Government would continue to provide support&#13;
through block grants and equalization grants (the latter would compensate for disparity between&#13;
districts). Finances will also be raised by Districts through graduated tax, rates and revenues&#13;
from other sources. At least fifty per cent of the revenues collected by City Councils in urban&#13;
areas would have to be given as grants to the local government which is two levels below it (i.e.&#13;
a Division Council). Similarly, in rural areas, fifty per cent of revenues collected by the local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
government councils at the sub-county level (i.e. two levels below the District Level) could be&#13;
retained for its own use;&#13;
c. the structure of the district government would consist of: the District Resistance Council as the&#13;
legislature; the District Executive Secretary/Town Clerk (as the Chief Executive&#13;
Officer/Accounting Officer) and his/her staff as the executive branch of government. A Central&#13;
Government Representative would be appointed by the President who would deal with/advise on&#13;
issues of national importance and otherwise monitor the implementation of government programs,&#13;
projects and services;&#13;
d. a structure of functional committees for the district and urban councils would budget for and&#13;
oversee the implementation of local programs, projects and services;&#13;
e. each district would employ its own staff and through the District Service Committee (DSCs) shall&#13;
have the power to appoint, discipline and dismiss all staff (other than the District Executive&#13;
Secretary and the Deputy District Executive Secretary who shall continue to be appointed by the&#13;
Public Service Commission). The conditions of service shall continue to be as per Public Service&#13;
Standing Orders issued by the Central Government;&#13;
f.  a number of other administrative functions are also devolved to the district level through the&#13;
setting up of various Committees such as the Local Government Accounts Committee (which shall&#13;
report on its findings to the Public Accounts Committee) and the District Tender Board (which&#13;
will take over the function of the Area Tender Boards and provide services to all Resistance&#13;
Councils in a district); and&#13;
g. a Local Government Finance Commission is to be established to advise Government on financing&#13;
of decentralized services including: assignment of responsibilities and revenue sources between&#13;
levels of Government, scale and distribution criteria for annual allocation of block and&#13;
equalization grants, and guidelines to local authorities for setting of rates of taxes, charges and&#13;
fees or priorities for allocation of equalization grants.&#13;
4.    The implementation of the reform is well underway and the commitment of Central Government&#13;
in its implementation is evident. A number of legal and administrative instruments have been issued to&#13;
bring into effect the implementation of the statute viz: Legal Notice No. 1 of 1994 introducing a separate&#13;
personnel system; General Notice No.40 of 1994 establishing DSCs; Circular Standing Instruction No.2&#13;
of 1994 Directive on DSCs; Public Service Commission Regulations for use by DSCs; Guidelines on the&#13;
Management of a Separate Personnel System; Financial Regulations; Tender Board Regulations;&#13;
Accounting Manual for District and Urban Councils; Audit Manual; Handbook for Facilitators of&#13;
Decentralization Sensitization Training and various booklets explaining Uganda's decentralization policy&#13;
and its implications. A number of committees - DSCs, Local Government Tender Boards and Local&#13;
Government Accounts Committees - have been appointed and inaugurated.&#13;
5.   Local governments have also responded with appreciable commitment. They have:- (i) retrenched&#13;
staff whose positions were abolished by the statute (i.e. sub-parish chiefs) and have paid them off using&#13;
existing terms and conditions of service; (ii) accepted the rationale and principle behind the restructuring&#13;
of departments and rationalization of personnel establishments; (iii) successfully tried out new methods&#13;
of service delivery; (iv) in some cases promoted cost sharing as a financing option as demonstrated in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
the cases of Jinja and Tororo hospitals; and (v) improved revenue collection/administration through&#13;
privatization (e.g. collection of market charges) and have accordingly had a higher revenue uptake.&#13;
6.     Work on personnel decentralization is well advanced with the appointment of District Service&#13;
Comrnittees for all districts and the completion of District Reviews (which would establish structures and&#13;
staffing) for the first thirteen districts; discussion of these reviews by the District Resistance Councils has&#13;
also commenced.&#13;
7.  Financial decentralization is being implemented in a phased manner. The recurrent budget is being&#13;
decentralized commencing with thirteen districts in the first year, fourteen districts in the second year and&#13;
twelve districts in the last year.&#13;
a.  During the first year of decentralization which commenced in 1993/94, in anticipation of adoption&#13;
of the Statute, the first thirteen districts were responsible for managing expenditures (and&#13;
reporting to Central Government) on the basis of specific votes for each sector Ministry which&#13;
was having its services decentralized. Thirteen districts were selected for the first phase of&#13;
decentralization; these are Arua, Gulu, Jinja, Kabale, Kabarole, Masaka, Mbale, Mbarara, Mpigi,&#13;
Mukono, Lira, Rakai and Tororo.  Similarly, the votes of the following ministries were&#13;
designated to comprise the decentralized district votes: Trade and Industry; Agriculture, Animal&#13;
Industry and Fisheries; Lands, Housing and Urban Development; Education and Sports; Health;&#13;
Information; Labor and Social Rehabilitation; Tourism and Antiquities; Natural Resources;&#13;
Women in Development, Youth and Culture; and Local Government.&#13;
b. In the second year of decentralization, 1994/95, the first thirteen districts have received block&#13;
grants from the Central Government and the District Resistance Councils are responsible for&#13;
deciding on the relative priorities among the various services being delivered by local&#13;
govermnents. Due to the fact that the District Reviews were in process at the time of budget&#13;
formnulation and consequently there are no established staffing complements upon which to base&#13;
allocation decisions, salaries which constitute a substantial portion of the expenditures continue&#13;
to remain as vote items. Objective criteria for the allocation of block grants for recurrent&#13;
expenditure (excluding salaries) have been developed and were to be applied with effect from&#13;
1994/95 financial year. There have been problems with the block grants made to the district&#13;
administrations. First, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning has not made allocations&#13;
strictly according to the criteria developed. Second, the basis for the block grants have not been&#13;
explained to district administrations. Third, the Local Government Finance Commission which&#13;
was to have acted as the forum for budgetary discussions has not been appointed yet due to some&#13;
unforeseen delays in the appointment process. Fourth, salaries continue to remain a vote item&#13;
until the staffing levels are agreed to between the Central Government and the districts. In&#13;
1994/95, the second group of fourteen districts also went to the vote system.&#13;
c. In 1995/96 the remaining twelve districts will go to the vote system whereas the first twenty&#13;
seven districts will go the block grant system.&#13;
d. By 1996/97 the financial decentralization process for the recurrent budget would have been&#13;
completed with all districts receiving funding from Central Government on a block grant system.&#13;
8.     Progress for the first fiscal year of decentralization has been monitored closely by the Ministry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 4 of 10&#13;
of Local Government and was reported as being good; only two out of thirteen districts were considered&#13;
to have had unsatisfactory performance in expenditure management and remedial actions have been&#13;
instituted. The principal issue raised by districts is that the vote system, while providing districts with&#13;
greater control of resources than in the past, does not allow savings in individual line items to be&#13;
redeployed within the district and savings revert back to the Central Government. The decentralization&#13;
of funds for services that are provided by the Central Government as per the Second Schedule of the&#13;
Statute (e.g. hospitals, secondary schools) but which were delegated to the districts was considered to&#13;
have resulted in the most visible improvement in service delivery. For example, hospitals in Jinja,&#13;
Masaka, Itojo, Tororo, Rakai and Kabale are reported to have had substantial improvement in the number&#13;
of patients (including outpatients) served, availability of drugs, food to patients, rehabilitation of premises&#13;
and payment of staff salaries and utility bills, etc. Other notable achievements include savings on staff&#13;
payments through identification of 'ghost employees' and contracting-out services.&#13;
9.     Despite the achievements to-date, it can be expected that successful implementation of the&#13;
decentralization program is likely to remain extremely challenging because of several shortcomings in&#13;
resources and human capacities in the local governments. Major shortcomings that will need to be&#13;
addressed include:&#13;
a. Lack of appropriate personnel and financial management systems/registries. For most districts,&#13;
the transfer of Central Government resources has brought a substantially higher level of finances&#13;
and personnel under the direct control of the districts. This has overloaded existing, largely&#13;
manual, systems which were barely coping with managing the resources raised and expended&#13;
locally; further, the use of Central Government resources has resulted in several new reporting&#13;
requirements which must be observed. Further, the transfer of personnel records and the need&#13;
to maintain financial documentation is likely to overwhelm the existing local government&#13;
registries.&#13;
b. Shortage of staff and the need for extensive training of available staff. In several key areas where&#13;
the problems are severe in Central Government, a similar situation is reflected in the local&#13;
governments. While, the actual situation varies considerably by district, there is a general&#13;
shortage of staff in areas such as planning, finance/accounting, etc.&#13;
c. Sub-county level administrative capabilities. Under the Statute, the RCIII level (i.e. the sub-&#13;
county) has a substantial role in revenue and expenditure management. While certain districts&#13;
(e.g. Jinja) had already commenced providing sub-counties with the responsibility for retaining&#13;
and managing resources, in most districts strengthening the sub-counties will be a substantial task.&#13;
Thus, Government is in need of considerable assistance in order to help maintain its current commitment&#13;
to reform and successfully effect this fundamental change in its approach to management of the economy&#13;
and delivery of services.&#13;
10.        Donor Support.  Government was assisted by donors in studying and defining its&#13;
decentralization policy. In 1992, IDA undertook a comprehensive piece of sector work entitled District&#13;
Management Study (Report No. 10695-UG).  This report studied the benefits and risks of the&#13;
decentralization process and made recommendations regarding the underlying systems and processes&#13;
which needed to be developed and a timetable for phasing in decentralization. Government commissioned&#13;
a team of local consultants and also asked DANIDA to field consultants to review the District&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
Management Study. A national workshop was convened to debate the report and the reviews.&#13;
11.        The Government of Denmark, through the Danish International Development Assistance&#13;
(DANIDA) has provided/is providing support to Government in various ways. First, when IDA's District&#13;
Management Study became the focus of debate and analysis within Government, experts were funded to&#13;
help Government in its decision making process. Second, an inter-disciplinary task force which prepared&#13;
the implementation modalities and reviewed the draft Local Government Statute was financed. Third,&#13;
the establishment and operations of the Decentralization Secretariat are being partially financed. Fourth,&#13;
substantial support for training and technical assistance is being provided up to March 1997. Fifth, some&#13;
districts were supplied with a limited number of office equipment Finally, the District Development&#13;
Program of one district (Rakai) is being financed.&#13;
12.   IDA has supported the decentralization program so far through the Economic and Financial&#13;
Management Project. First, the District Reviews being conducted by Government have been supported.&#13;
Second, activities yet to be completed under the EFM Project will also have an impact: systems and&#13;
procedures to be implemented for central personnel and financial management will provide an important&#13;
underpinning for decentralized systems; and some funds have been allocated for a program to commence&#13;
implementation of and train staff for decentralized personnel and financial systems.&#13;
Project Component Objectives and Description&#13;
13.   The objective of this component is to continue the process of assisting local governments to&#13;
improve their abilities to properly manage and administer responsibilities entrusted to them and thus&#13;
improve the quality of delivery of services in a viable and sustainable manner. This objective will be&#13;
achieved through (i) ensuring that appropriate systems and procedures for development planning,&#13;
personnel and financial management and record keeping are in place; (ii) training local government staff&#13;
in the use of the new systems and procedures; and (iii) providing additional inputs for the improved&#13;
functioning of local governments.&#13;
14.   The specific activities to be funded will include&#13;
a.  implementing the agreed to changes in inter-governmental finance and developing the&#13;
implementation plans for future changes including:&#13;
i.    studying and making recommendations for decentralizing the development budget;&#13;
ii.    proposing the establishment, capitalization and management of a revolving development&#13;
fund;&#13;
iii.   in this regard, consultancy funds for acquiring both local and foreign consultancy services&#13;
for specific activities to be defined at a later date are provided for.&#13;
b. Strengthening financial management structures, systems and procedures by:&#13;
i.  supporting the computerization of accounts;&#13;
iii. supporting the preparation of final accounts for upto the first two years subsequent to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
decentralization for several local governments;&#13;
iv. preparing resource endowment profiles (district poverty profiles) as the basis for developing&#13;
criteria for equalization grants;&#13;
c. Strengthening of personnel management structures, systems and procedures by;&#13;
i.  supporting the computerization of the decentralized payroll;&#13;
ii. financing the development of a decentralized records management system;&#13;
d. Training contingent upon the tasks listed above.  Additionally, training in Result Oriented&#13;
Management would be provided: to be phased - 13, 14 and 12 districts in that order and in 6&#13;
large municipalities;&#13;
e. Retooling and civil works. Basic improvements to buildings to enable the local governments to&#13;
establish registries, computer rooms and have modest offices out of which to operate. Essential&#13;
inputs (i.e. motorcycles, furnishings and office equipment such as typewriters, filing cabinets and&#13;
safes) to allow district administrations to fulfil their mandate will be provided; and&#13;
f.  Vehicles would be provided on a cost recovery basis and repayments by districts would be used&#13;
to create a District Transportation Revolving Fund.&#13;
15.   The component will be managed by the Ministry of Local Government which has been charged&#13;
with the responsibility of implementing decentralization. The locus of implementation will be the&#13;
Decentralization Secretariat within the Ministry which will also act as the technical backstopping facility,&#13;
wherever necessary.  There will be a Project Administration group within the Ministry of Local&#13;
Government which would be trained with the objective of developing a capacity within that Ministry to&#13;
manage, inter alia, the proposed IDA District Development Project (FY97) and disseminate good&#13;
procurement practices in the districts. This group would initially be twinned with the Project Office and&#13;
it would learn through on-thejob training; it would initially undertake project administration functions&#13;
under the guidance of the Project Office and subsequently undertake these independently.&#13;
Inter-Govermnental Finance&#13;
16.   Decentralizing the Development Budget: Inter-Governmental Financial andDevelopment Planning.&#13;
Criteria for and calculation of the block grants for the recurrent budget have been developed and applied&#13;
in the 1994/95 financial year. They will annually be refined by the Local Government Finance&#13;
Commission. Resources allocated for delegated services (i.e. per Schedule Two of the Statute) for which&#13;
the system of Votes may continue were not included in the block grant but were given as separate lines&#13;
of expenditure. It is important to continue this arrangement given the improvement in service delivery&#13;
that occurred once the resources were channelled directly to service providers as discussed in para 13&#13;
above. The tasks at hand are to:&#13;
a. design modalities for the decentralization of the development budget. While the completion of&#13;
the decentralization of the recurrent budget would provide the districts with a much higher degree&#13;
of control over service delivery, the transfer of control over capital resources would represent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
an equally significant step. However, such decentralization would not only have a fundamental&#13;
impact on Central Government but would result in fundamental changes in the manner in which&#13;
donors and multi-lateral agencies support and finance development projects in Uganda. The&#13;
design will also need to include mechanisms to ensure consistency between fiscal policies of the&#13;
Central Government and expenditure policies of local governments to ensure macro-economic&#13;
stability. This study would be completed by June 1996 and phased decentralization would&#13;
commence by July 1997;&#13;
b. propose the establishment, capitalization and management of a revolving development fund. This&#13;
will allow local governments to optimize the use of scarce financial resources by choosing&#13;
between debt financing (from the development fund), locally generated revenues, donor funds&#13;
and central government transfers in funding infrastructure investments. To allow Government&#13;
to allocate resources from the revolving fund, financial and operational indicators at the District&#13;
level would need to be developed to allow for comparison of performance across districts. This&#13;
study is projected to be completed by June 1996 and a GOU position statement on its findings&#13;
is to be issued by December 1996;&#13;
c. since the agenda is substantial and evolving, provision has been made for a consultancy fund of&#13;
US $ I million for acquiring both local and foreign consultancy services for specific activities&#13;
(e.g. support to the Local Government Finance Commission) and also for acquiring expert&#13;
assistance on an "as-and-when-needed-basis" for the entire life of the credit.&#13;
The tasks outlined above fall within the mandate of the Local Government Finance Commission. For a&#13;
number of reasons, the appointment has been delayed but is expected to be completed shortly and the&#13;
tasks may be further refined at that time. Additionally, Terms of Reference for consultancy support to&#13;
the LGFC would also be prepared at that time.&#13;
Strengthening Financial Management Structures, Systems and Procedures&#13;
17.   Computerization of Accounts. The computerization of accounts is necessary. It will bring about&#13;
efficiency in capturing and processing data, information storage and retrieval. It will promote&#13;
improvements in budgeting, revenue and expenditure management. It will help management easily&#13;
monitor financial and budgetary operations thereby enabling the DES to have a firm grasp on the&#13;
financial position of the district. The timeliness and availability of financial data brought about by&#13;
computerization will assist in (i) corrective actions being instituted at an early stage; (ii) timely publishing&#13;
of annual accounts thereby increasing transparency and enhancing the credibility of local governments.&#13;
Further, local governments will continue to provide information to the Central Government on financial&#13;
resources provided by the centre which are expended at or below the district level. In order to ensure&#13;
that the business requirements of both Central and local governments would be met through the&#13;
computerized system, an assessment of the needs of various users is being undertaken; the task is being&#13;
funded through the Project Preparation Facility.&#13;
18.   Preparation of Final Accounts. Upon close of the first financial year after decentralization of&#13;
funds under the vote system, each of the thirteen districts will be required to prepare final accounts which&#13;
would include the financial position of both Central and Local Government revenues expended during the&#13;
fiscal year. There are some districts which have sufficient technical capacity to undertake this exercise&#13;
themselves, there are others which could use some assistance and yet others which would require&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

extensive help.  In order to assess the situation, a survey team consisting of representatives from the&#13;
Auditor General's Office, the Commissioner/Treasury Officer of Accounts, the Inspectorate in the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government and the Financial Management Division of the Decentralization Secretariat&#13;
conducted a survey of the first thirteen districts to determine if the accounts have been prepared and&#13;
sufficient background documentation is available for purposes of auditing the accounts. Similar surveys&#13;
will be required for the balance of the districts close to the end of the first year after decentralization.&#13;
On the basis of these surveys, assistance would be tailored for district and urban councils to ensure that&#13;
accounts are prepared properly and in a timely manner; the assistance would be provided by the private&#13;
sector i.e. local accounting firms. Provision has also been made to provide assistance, if required, in&#13;
preparing the accounts for the first year under the block grant system. DANIDA has indicated its&#13;
willingness to fund the same or other local firms in providing support to the Office of the Auditor&#13;
General in auditing the accounts prepared. This initiative would allow future financial decentralization&#13;
to proceed with a clean slate as far as past accounts are concerned and also pave the way for the merger&#13;
of accounts of central government transfers with those of local governments. Also the findings of the&#13;
auditors would be useful in the creation of proper accounting systems for the future. By March 1996,&#13;
twenty seven districts are expected to be in compliance with the requirement of the Local Governments&#13;
Statute that audited accounts should be prepared within six months of the end of the financial year and&#13;
by March 1997 all thirty nine districts are expected to be in compliance with the Statute.&#13;
Strengthening Personnel Management Structures, Systems and Procedures (including Records&#13;
Management).&#13;
19.   This is an area where the needs are more immediate. While the decentralization of financial&#13;
management is being phased over a three year period, the decentralization of personnel management has&#13;
already gone into effect country-wide. Further, ensuring the integrity of the personnel management&#13;
systems during the decentralization process would be important to ensure that the considerable amount&#13;
of effort which has gone into cleaning up the records in the central databases continues to result in&#13;
substantial savings to GOU. The correct data hitherto maintained by the central government would be&#13;
passed from central to district governments. Fresh appointments, promotions, terminations and other&#13;
personnel actions regarding district level personnel would be within the control of the District Service&#13;
Committees. Consequently, the districts would up date records of the Central Government.&#13;
20.  Computerization of the Decentralized Payroll. The central payroll of Government would need to&#13;
be demarcated by districts and the data be provided to the districts. This will be undertaken in a two-&#13;
stage approach. First, by July 1995, consolidated payroll processing of all District Administration staff&#13;
and staff formerly employed by the Central Government would be undertaken by the Uganda Computer&#13;
Services on behalf of the districts. Second, between July 1996 and June 1997, the districts would&#13;
themselves commence decentralized management of payroll.  Several preparatory steps would be&#13;
undertaken.  The survey of user needs discussed in para 17 would also include the information&#13;
requirements for a personnel system at the Central and local government level. On the basis of the above&#13;
information, an appropriate personnel/payroll information system would be provided to District&#13;
Administrations that would interface with their financial systems. This system would lead to the&#13;
establishment of district staff lists, documentation for its use would be prepared and at least two&#13;
(personnel) officers trained in its use. While, in general, the system would be computerized, alternative&#13;
manual systems (with appropriate checks and balances) may be designed for districts without electricity.&#13;
Also, the system design would ensure that sufficient level of detail is provided back to MPS so that&#13;
Central Government can monitor data integrity and the civil service wage bill. Computerization of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 9 of 10&#13;
payroll and bio-data will take advantage of the experience of MPS in computerizing personnel records&#13;
of restructured ministries and the experience of Rakai and five other local governments.&#13;
21.  Decentralized Records Management. The District Service Committees have already taken over&#13;
decision making regarding all personnel actions for all employees of local governments. The District&#13;
Teaching Service Committees would do the same for the teaching cadre. Both the DSC and the DTC for&#13;
each district will need to be set up, strengthened and trained.&#13;
22.   The confidential and open files of various civil servants being transferred to the districts would&#13;
need to be transferred to the District Personnel offices. This would be supported by the provision of&#13;
secure storage facilities and procedures for handling such files at the district level. A records survey was&#13;
conducted to establish the current state of district records and information flow and also assess the short&#13;
and long term needs with regards to equipment, furniture and tools; office space; personnel; training&#13;
needs and guidelines; and appropriate records classification system that may be applied in local&#13;
government. Funding was providedfrom the PPF. The results of the survey were used to determine&#13;
the activities to be undertaken under this part of the component. Training will also be provided for&#13;
records management.&#13;
23.   The preparation of schemes of service for at least 3 districts and two municipalities with&#13;
contrasting characteristics to be used as models by the rest of the districts will be a critical activity. The&#13;
schemes are expected to be prepared under the on-going District Reviews.&#13;
Results Oriented Management&#13;
24.     ROM would be introduced into the local government budgeting procedures in synchronization&#13;
with its introduction into the Central Government budgeting processes. Hence, starting in FY97, ROM&#13;
would be introduced to the local budget process and would be used to promote: (i) priority setting within&#13;
and between sectors;(ii) matching inputs with outputs; (iii)sensitivity to timeliness in service delivery&#13;
(respect for time-frames). Seminars for ROM would start for all the districts and training would be&#13;
provided in ROM for senior district and urban officials.&#13;
Training&#13;
25.   Training funds will be disaggregated in two respects: (i) by component and (ii) by categorization&#13;
between discretionary and non-discretionary training. Non- discretionary funds for local government will&#13;
be under the direct management of the component manager for the Local Government Capacity Building&#13;
Component. The design of the training programs will incorporate the information from Training Needs&#13;
Assessments (TNAs) which have already been undertaken (e.g. the TNA conducted for districts under&#13;
the Northern Uganda Reconstruction Project, the Uganda First Urban Project training plans).&#13;
Information will be exchanged between the Decentralization Secretariat and the coordination units of&#13;
UFUP and NURP to establish areas of duplication with a view to eliminating them from the project&#13;
without denying the beneficiaries training opportunities.&#13;
Civil Works and Retooling&#13;
26. Some basic improvements are required to establish a reasonable level of physical infrastructure for&#13;
the district administrations. What is envisaged is largely refurbishing building exteriors and interiors,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
ANNEX 8&#13;
Page 10 of 10&#13;
making windows burglar proof, etc. The need to construct new premises would be kept to the minimum&#13;
possible. The end product would be modest offices out of which District Administrations could operate.&#13;
Essential inputs for retooling would also be provided.  Office and computing equipment (including&#13;
printers, stabilizers, generators for back-up power, UPSs, disk banks) and furnishings in sufficient&#13;
quantities to implement the systems and procedures described in the paras above would also be provided.&#13;
Finally, computer software and stationery supplies to ensure that day-to-day operations run smoothly&#13;
would be provided in a decreasing order over the life span of the project. A determination of the civil&#13;
works requirements has been undertaken to refine the cost estimates as a special activity by MLG staff;&#13;
the costs are being reimbursed from the PPF.&#13;
27.   The project would also finance a few vehicles per district to assist district management to monitor&#13;
and supervise district-wide activities. The cost of the vehicles is expected to be completely recovered&#13;
from the districts themselves over a four to five year repayment period and the funds would be deposited&#13;
into a Revolving Fund dedicated for purchase of vehicles. The management and administration of the&#13;
Revolving Fund would be contracted out to a commercial bank and detailed guidelines would be provided&#13;
to the districts on the modalities of accessing the fund. The cost recovery approach is expected to have&#13;
two major benefits. First, it is expected that the need for repayment would encourage the districts to&#13;
choose the lowest cost solutions for their needs. Hence, while some 4WD vehicles are still expected to&#13;
be required for district level monitoring, there is greater likelihood of revenue collectors, for example,&#13;
being provided motorcycles. Second, the operation of the Revolving Fund is likely to provide lessons&#13;
of experience for the much larger revolving fund which is likely to be implemented under the District&#13;
Development Project.&#13;
Parallel Projects&#13;
28.   There are several parallel activities being funded from other projects, most of which are funded&#13;
by DANIDA.&#13;
a. For the next 2-3 years much of the training (sensitization and skills development) will be provided&#13;
through a grant from DANIDA and IDA's EFMP credit.&#13;
b. The pensions system would be reviewed in the light of decentralization. The objective would be&#13;
to create a portable pension system. The initiatives of the National Social Security Fund would&#13;
be examined with a view to adopting relevant recommendations. Otherwise a consultant whose&#13;
funding is already earmarked under the DANIDA grant will be hired.&#13;
c. The resource and revenue potentials of the districts are not known, yet calculation of the&#13;
equalization grant and the equitable distribution of resources under the development budget will&#13;
largely be based on (i) realized potential and existing capacity/infrastructure; (ii) unexploited&#13;
potential; and (iii) revenue effort or expenditure management. The social economic data&#13;
generated under the resource endowment profiles will be instrumental in evolving policies that&#13;
will govern inter-governmental financial transfers and development planning. This task is slated&#13;
for funding by UNDP. The credit will finance this task if the anticipated funding from UNDP&#13;
does not materialize. A short-term consultant will be needed for a maximum of four months.&#13;

UGANDA INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
LEGAL SECTOR REFORM&#13;
Background&#13;
1.           Legal System. The Constitution of Uganda and the Juridicature Act of 1967 constitute&#13;
the foundation of the Ugandan legal system as it exists today. The Act provides for the continued&#13;
application of the received English law in Uganda and its co-existence with customary law which is firmly&#13;
embedded in the traditions, culture, customs and values of the indigenous people of Uganda. The body&#13;
of statutory law (i.e. laws made by the legislature) is made up of largely outdated legislation in almost&#13;
every sector. Specifically, laws regarding commerce, traffic and taxation which affect business, industry&#13;
and private sector development are in dire need of modernization. For example, legislation in commerce&#13;
was introduced in the pre-independence era and was modelled on the legislation applying in the United&#13;
Kingdom at that time.&#13;
2.           Institutions. The problem of outdated laws is exacerbated by the absence of timely and&#13;
rigorous enforcement of these laws due to weaknesses in the major institutions in the sector. In addition&#13;
to the police, these institutions are:&#13;
a.    The Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs (MJCA). Most legal activities (e.g.&#13;
formulating, drafting and enacting the National Constitution, laws and documents) fall&#13;
within the purview of MJCA or other entities that operate within its mandate. There are&#13;
seven Departments within the Ministry : Solicitor-General's Office, Public Prosecution,&#13;
Civil Affairs, First Parliamentary Counsel, Administrator-General, Registrar-General and&#13;
Constitutional Affairs.&#13;
b.    In addition, five other bodies outside MJCA also fall within the control of the Ministry&#13;
i.e. the Constitutional Commission, the Human Rights Commission, the Law Reform&#13;
Commission, the Law Revision Commission and the Law Development Centre;&#13;
c.    The Law Council exercises general supervision and control over entry and practice of law&#13;
in Uganda;&#13;
d.    The Judiciary (consisting of the Supreme Court, the High Court and Magistrate Courts)&#13;
is responsible for adjudicating, deciding and settling legal disputes in accordance with the&#13;
law;&#13;
e.    There are Resistance Council Courts at the village, parish and subcounty levels.Their&#13;
jurisdiction is, by law, restricted to causes and matters of civil and customary nature as&#13;
defined in the Resistance Committees (Judicial Powers) Statute 1 of 1988. They handle&#13;
their proceedings in their respective local languages and are generally more accessible&#13;
to people.&#13;
3.    A peculiarity of the existing criminal justice system in Uganda is the use of police staff as&#13;
prosecutors in the lower courts due to shortages of qualified lawyers in the Department of Public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
Prosecution.&#13;
4.     Shortcomings in the Legal Sector.  In general the MJCA is confronted with the following&#13;
problems &#13;
a.     insufficient staffing of lawyers, paralegal and secretarial staff. This is mainly due to the&#13;
large discrepancy between salaries offered in the public sector and the fees lawyers&#13;
commnand in the private sector. As a result, the MICA has a high vacancy rate for&#13;
professional posts. As of June 1993 for example, there was in the Solicitor-General's&#13;
Office a vacancy rate of 81 %, 55 % in the Department of the Administrator-General, and&#13;
49% in the Office of the Registrar-General. Similar problems exist for support staff as&#13;
well. The Registrar-General's Office currently has only twenty two filled posts for&#13;
support staff out of sixty three established posts.&#13;
b.     outdated office equipment and technology and the lack of proper office facilities also&#13;
affect service delivery. This has particular impact on Departments which depend heavily&#13;
on the availability of appropriate records management systems (e.g the Registrars'&#13;
Department which maintains the official incorporation documents of companies);&#13;
C.     absence of proper pre-service, in-service and other training programs. For most lawyers,&#13;
the last period of training received is at the Law Development Center prior to being&#13;
admitted to the bar and the bench after successful completion of their studies.&#13;
d.     archaic legislation in some important areas such as commerce, domestic relations and&#13;
procedural laws which are no longer responsive to the current needs of the Ugandan&#13;
society. Most of these laws were passed during the colonial era and are not conducive&#13;
to private sector development.&#13;
e.     absence of easily available documentation with regard to the Laws of Uganda (which&#13;
were last published in 1964) and the latest legal decisions (which are normially&#13;
continuously updated through a system of Law Reports but which are largely unavailable&#13;
in Uganda from 1958 onwards);&#13;
f.     lack of office supplies. While this affects all department for basic items such as folders,&#13;
stationery, etc. it has a larger impact on those departments which are heavily dependent&#13;
on their interaction with the general public through forms.&#13;
The pervasive weaknesses in MJCA are also evidenced in other areas of the legal sector (i.e. magistrates,&#13;
prosecutors, etc.).&#13;
5.     Donor Assistance. Assistance in addressing the problems in the legal sector has been forthcoming&#13;
on a limited basis from various donors. It has been mostly confined to the provision of office equipment,&#13;
vehicles and books, the upgrading of selected physical facilities, especially courts, and the supply of&#13;
expatriate technical assistance to fill vacancies. Specifically,&#13;
a.     DANIDA has been funding pilot projects for the construction of new courtrooms and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
judges' residences in nine targeted areas; in addition, they have provided the Judiciary&#13;
with stationery and assisted in the replenishment and refurbishing of the High Court&#13;
library;&#13;
b.     ODA has assisted the Judiciary since 1990 by bringing into Uganda three expatriate&#13;
judges in order to ease the caseload and to conduct training; it has also provided&#13;
equipment, vehicles and books to the Supreme and High Courts;&#13;
c.     USAID has provided assistance to the Human Rights Commission and the Supreme Court&#13;
by supplying them with books; and&#13;
d.     The Austrian Government has also been involved in endeavors to improve the&#13;
performance of the legal sector. Their main involvement focused on assisting LDC to&#13;
produce law bulletins and statutory instruments.&#13;
6.     Overall Program for Sector Reform.  The Government of Uganda has focused on the issues&#13;
concerning the legal sector by including it as one of the priority areas for strengthening under its Capacity&#13;
Building Plan. It has, hence, attempted to move forward from an ad hoc approach to a comprehensive&#13;
program to improve the entire system of delivery of justice.&#13;
7.     One of the actions that Government has undertaken in the recent past to demonstrate its&#13;
commitment to reforming the sector in a sustainable manner is to significantly increase the salaries of&#13;
professional lawyers as of July 1994. The level of salaries was extremely low with professional lawyers&#13;
earning an entry level salary of approximately $30 per month while the private sector lawyers earned&#13;
several multiples of that wage. Further, unlike other professionals, lawyers were unable to moonlight&#13;
to supplement their salaries since this would represent a conflict of interest for which they could be&#13;
debarred from the profession. The situation was reflected in MJCA's inability to recruit with a high level&#13;
of vacancies resulting as has been discussed earlier. As part of the 1994/95 budget, the Government has&#13;
increased this wage scale upto a minimum of $640 per month; while these are still below the private legal&#13;
sector salaries/earnings, it will provide a substantial boost to the morale of professional legal staff in the&#13;
public sector and will improve the quality of staff entering the legal system. For example, for the first&#13;
time, vacancy advertisements for lawyers in the MJCA have been oversubscribed with a substantial&#13;
improvement in the qualifications of candidates applying for the position. It is anticipated that the&#13;
increased salaries would appropriately complement the inputs provided under the project and hence there&#13;
should be a substantial impetus to project viability and sustainability.&#13;
8.     IDA's support and the assistance provided under this project is focused upon the commercial&#13;
aspects of law and on the settlement of civil disputes. The criminal law and institutions that administer&#13;
it are specifically excluded from the purview of the project even though these functions (e.g. police and&#13;
prosecution) are of significant importance and may have substantial linkages with and impact upon the&#13;
entire system of justice administration. This decision is predicated upon IDA's current policies which&#13;
take into account the fact that its primary mandate is economic development. However, to the extent that&#13;
general refresher training, for example, is provided to all lawyers within the MJCA, the staff of the&#13;
Department of Public Prosecution have been included in such training. Further, other donors such as&#13;
ODA which has in the past supported the criminal justice system are likely to continue such support&#13;
thereby ensuring that these critical areas will be improved as well.&#13;

Project Component Objectives and Description&#13;
9.     The proposed project is expected to achieve the following objectives:&#13;
a.    to review the entire legal education system in Uganda.&#13;
b.     Law Revision and Reform of laws, especially commercial and related laws;&#13;
c.    institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs (MJCA)&#13;
as well as the Judiciary; and&#13;
d.    increased cost recovery for services rendered by the Legal Sector commencing with&#13;
Administrator General and Registrar General.&#13;
Legal Education, Training and Accreditation of Lawvyers&#13;
10.    The current system of legal education in Uganda is based on the recommendations made by the&#13;
Gower Commission in 1969. Under this system, all prospective lawyers in Uganda have to undergo&#13;
training in two institutions; one teaching substantive law and the other professional skills. Hence, after&#13;
acquiring a legal degree from any recognised university, all lawyers in Uganda are required to undergo&#13;
further legal training for a period of one year. Upon completion of the training, lawyers can then&#13;
practice law in the public sector. In order to practice in the private sector, a certificate of practice needs&#13;
to be issued by the Law Council. In 1970, The Law Development Centre Act was passed establishing&#13;
the LDC as the only institution which could provide the legal training required prior to being enrolled&#13;
as an advocate. The training activity of the Centre takes the form of a formal instruction course in legal&#13;
practice to law graduates for a period of nine months combined with an additional three months of legal&#13;
practice. A pre-service training course is also conducted for magistrates.&#13;
11.    LDC limits its intake of students to only sixty per year for the professional qualification course.&#13;
Its candidate pool is from the undergraduate legal programs of Makerere University; University of Dar&#13;
es Salaam, Tanzania; University of Nairobi, Kenya; and University of Lusaka, Zambia. Candidates with&#13;
undergraduate degrees from other Universities need to be cleared by the Law Council prior to being&#13;
considered as candidates for selection by LDC. The teaching staff consists of 20-25 lawyers who are also&#13;
allowed to practice on a part-time basis; this lack of staff defines one of the limitations on LDC's ability&#13;
to increase its output of students or deliver Continuing Professional Education. Another limitation is the&#13;
training delivery approach which is restricted to residential courses therefore limiting total number of&#13;
students trained in all courses to one hundred and twenty, the hostel capacity. LDC's costs which were&#13;
U Sh 330 mm for 1993 are funded through subventions from the Government since there is no cost&#13;
recovery from students.&#13;
12.   Over the years, LDC's ability to provide legal training has deteriorated considerably. As LDC&#13;
has struggled to meet its statutory obligations for pre-service training and law research and reporting&#13;
(which is discussed later), it has been unable to dedicate any significant level of resources to Continuing&#13;
Legal Education in the profession. This situation has been exacerbated by the absence of any mandatory&#13;
requirements for CLE for lawyers as a requirement to maintain their ability to continue in practice. In&#13;
order to ensure that these needs are satisfactorily addressed, a substantial change in the delivery of legal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
education and training in Uganda is required. As a first step, the project would fund a study to evaluate&#13;
the existing status of legal education in Uganda with a view to finding ways and means of making it more&#13;
relevant and responsive to the changing conditions in the country. Taking into account the findings of&#13;
this study, GOU will adopt a satisfactory policy on legal education. GOUfurnishing a statement defining&#13;
its Policy on Legal Education is a condition of disbursement for the legal sector component.&#13;
Law Revision and Reform in Uganda&#13;
13.   These are two related activities which are separate but have several linkages: law revision is the&#13;
process of consolidating various Laws of Uganda into a series of volumes with the objective of making&#13;
these Laws readily available to various participants in the legal process. Law reform is the amendment&#13;
of specific laws from the perspective of modernizing these laws within the socio-economic context&#13;
prevalent in Uganda and to remove impediments to Government's stated objective of making the private&#13;
sector as the focal point for growth in the economy.&#13;
14.   Institutional and Policy Framework for Law Revision. Law Revision is the responsibility of a&#13;
Law Revision Commission. Preparations have already commenced for the Law Revision exercise which&#13;
would be undertaken through parallel donor financing (USAID to fund the consolidation of laws and ODA&#13;
to fund the printing of the laws). The Laws (Revised Edition) Statute was passed in October 1994 which&#13;
(a) empowers the LRC to consolidate all the statutory laws in force in the country as of the end of 1995;&#13;
and (b) appoints two Commissioners to conduct the Law Revision exercise.&#13;
15.   Institutional and Policy Framework for Law Reform. Law reform exercise in Uganda is the&#13;
responsibility of a statutorily established body, called the Law Reform Commission. It is composed of&#13;
a Chairnan and six other Commissioners appointed by the President on the advice of the Attorney-&#13;
General; to-date, the Chairman and three Commissioners have been appointed allowing the Commission&#13;
to commence its work.&#13;
16.   Law Reform : Focus on Private Sector Development. An activity which would be undertaken&#13;
concurrently under the project would be the reform of the laws which impact upon economic activities,&#13;
such as commercial, property and revenue laws, in order to spur on the required development of the&#13;
private sector and to enhance investor confidence. In the recent past, some reports were prepared by&#13;
GOU Task Forces to identify the most critical areas for law reform. The prioritization of laws requiring&#13;
reform was undertaken with the assistance of the private sector at a one-day workshop which was held&#13;
in Kampala in October 1994. The prioritized list of laws identified for reform during the period of&#13;
project implementation have been agreed with IDA. The necessary draft laws are to be prepared,&#13;
published as bills and submitted for the legislature's consideration by July 1996. Ideally, law reform is&#13;
an activity to be undertaken in-house by the Law Reform Commission so that GOU's capacity can be&#13;
built up. However, it is unlikely that this could be successfully undertaken given the fact that the LRC&#13;
Commissioners are only recently appointed and the administrative structure is still being set up. The&#13;
approach agreed between GOU and IDA is to use the services of consultants for the implementation of&#13;
the activity of law reform and provide for the staff of the Law Reform Commission to be involved in the&#13;
actual execution of the studies in order to enhance the in-house capacity of the Law Reform Commission.&#13;
17.   Law Reform : Focus on Women In Development. IDA is also planning to fund (as part of the&#13;
Law Reform exercise) amendment of laws relating to domestic relations. These laws define the rights&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
of women and have bearing on the position and treatment of women within society and their ability to&#13;
engage independently in constructive commercial/economic activity. An earlier exercise had been&#13;
undertaken by GOU but had not been completed due to various reasons. The agreed approach is for the&#13;
draft law which had been prepared under the earlier exercise to be used as the point of departure for the&#13;
current exercise. Using consultancy assistance, the draft law would be updated based on current socio-&#13;
economic changes and would be discussed widely with various stakeholder groups. The draft Domestic&#13;
Relations Bill is to be presented to legislature for consideration by December 1996.&#13;
Law Reporting&#13;
18.    As discussed above, the Ugandan legal system is based on common law which has a legal theory&#13;
that is deeply rooted in the precedent system. Similarly, research is required prior to undertaking law&#13;
reform and introducing new legislation. As is the case for other activities in this sector, there has been&#13;
no systematic law research and reporting due to lack of resources. This, in turn, has handicapped&#13;
lawyers, prosecutors and judges who require readily available information on precedents in order to&#13;
perform their duties. The main series of Uganda Law Reports is presently out of production; the backlog&#13;
dates back to 1958 although between 1971-1973 three volumes were produced which are also currently&#13;
out of print. In the absence of funding to produce the law reports, a shorter abstract of the decisions&#13;
made by the Supreme and High Courts is currently being published; even this is out of date with its last&#13;
edition having been published in 1991.&#13;
19.    Institutional and Policy Framework for Law Reporting. The Law Development Centre (LDC)&#13;
is responsible for compiling, editing and publishing law reports for Uganda. In addition, it has a&#13;
substantial role in legal education (which has been discussed in the earlier section on legal education).&#13;
Hence, not only does the LDC, like other Government institutions, suffer from a lack of resources but&#13;
from the resources that it does secure, law research and reporting do not always receive highest priority.&#13;
The law reporting component of the Centre's work is the most important in view of the fact that it is the&#13;
only institution in the country responsible for the compilation of case law for the entire legal profession.&#13;
20.    The project will fund the preparation and publication of Law Reports. For the Law Reports&#13;
between 1958-1970 (i.e. thirteen volumes), the materials for the reports have been assembled but only&#13;
about 20 percent has been edited. Three volumes (i.e. 1971-1973) were produced and need to be&#13;
reprinted. Finally, for Law Reports between 1974-1994 (i.e. twenty volumes), while the materials have&#13;
been assembled, no editing work has been undertaken. Hence, there is a substantial backlog of editorial&#13;
work to be undertaken and support is being provided through local consultants who will supplement the&#13;
LDC's in-house resources in order to get the Reports printed in a timely manner. An important objective&#13;
to be achieved is to increase the level of cost recovery from the sales of Uganda Law Reports such that&#13;
by the end of the project period, this activity would be largely self-financing.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening of MJCA&#13;
21.    The project will provide support to the Ministry in improving its performance by providing:&#13;
a.    substantial amount of staff training. Various officers within the Ministry will undergo&#13;
training in the respective fields of their assignments. The training requested is mainly&#13;
for study tours, Masters' Degrees and Diplomas in specific relevant fields, short-term&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

courses and attachments to the relevant Departments in some of the neighboring&#13;
Commonwealth countries. Given the unavailability of locally available legal training, the&#13;
MJCA in conjunction with the CBS will develop a training program which would balance&#13;
the need for training in specialized skills and the cost effectiveness of locally delivered&#13;
courses using out-of-country trainers. Support staff training in computing, accounting,&#13;
registry procedures, personnel management and office management would be undertaken&#13;
locally.&#13;
b.     access to legal information i.e. law books, updated and revised Laws of Uganda and the&#13;
latest case law as embodied in the Uganda Law Reports. The books would be purchased&#13;
competitively whereas the preparation of the latter two items is to be funded under the&#13;
project;&#13;
c.    increased access to inputs necessary to accomplish the job such as vehicles, office&#13;
equipment, supplies, etc.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening of the Judiciary&#13;
22.    The institutional weaknesses besetting the Judiciary result in delays in the handling of cases thus&#13;
causing backlogs at all levels of the courts. The waiting period for a case to be disposed ranges from two&#13;
to six years. Record keeping and retrieval of files is entirely manual and inefficiently organized such that&#13;
it takes a number of days in some instances, to locate the right file. The institutional strengthening will&#13;
be similar to that of the MJCA i.e. training, access to legal information and some assistance in acquiring&#13;
inputs will be provided. Differences from the MJCA's strengthening program will consist largely in the&#13;
training program. Specifically, training will consist of:&#13;
a.     Pre-Service Training. This will consist of induction courses that will be conducted for the&#13;
newly recruited magistrates to familiarize them with the practical aspects of their&#13;
profession and to develop appropriate specialized legal knowledge required in their job.&#13;
The course will help develop a strong sense of ethical responsibility and a professional&#13;
attitude which will underpin impartiality and discourage corruption. There are ten&#13;
magistrates that are recruited annually and the course will be for a period not exceeding&#13;
one month.&#13;
b.     Promotional Training. This will be an in-service training conducted for senior magistrates&#13;
who are eligible for promotion to judges in order to prepare them for their new&#13;
assigmnent. It will be held once a year for sixty senior magistrates. The course will&#13;
further serve to expose the participants to new developments in the various areas of law.&#13;
c.     Training of Judges. Twenty seven judges will be trained by means of in-service seminars,&#13;
workshops and study tours. This training will be specifically designed to keep judges&#13;
abreast of recent legal developments and to provide them with less structured opportunity&#13;
to have an exchange of their legal views and lessons of experience.&#13;
d.     Attachments. Through this program registrars would undertake attachments with the&#13;
neighboring countries with similar court system which have efficient registries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 8 of 10&#13;
The inputs provided to strengthen the Judiciary will ensure predictability of the law in Uganda thus&#13;
encouraging investors to do business in the country as they will be assured of the availability of an&#13;
effective enforcement machinery to protect their rights and property.&#13;
23.   Libraries. The synergies involved in strengthening both institutions simultaneously will provide&#13;
opportunities to reap economies of scale especially in the area of improved availability of information.&#13;
Since the same Laws, Case Laws and books are shared by judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys, the&#13;
optimal approach to providing information is to set up or improve commonly accessible Law Libraries.&#13;
This can be expected to reduce duplication and provide substantial savings. Consequently, a study on&#13;
Law Libraries has been undertaken from the PPF and its findings have been used to determine the scope&#13;
of Libraries and the funding levels to be supported under the project.&#13;
Outputs Resulting from Institutional Strengthening&#13;
24.   The inputs provided for institutional strengthening are expected to result in a better functioning&#13;
Ministry which would improve the quality of service rendered to the public. However, there are two&#13;
problems with output measurement: first, improvements may be qualitative (e.g. more consistent court&#13;
decisions resulting from readier availability of Laws and Law Reports) and second, the improvements in&#13;
quantified outputs may be dependent on factors other than the inputs provided by the project. This&#13;
problem is further compounded by the fact that there has been insufficient monitoring of systemic outputs&#13;
from the perspective of redressing shortcomings in the system.&#13;
25.    Systemic Measurements. The primary unit of measurement in the system is the number of cases&#13;
processed. The backlog of cases has become one of the primary indicators of the inefficiency of the&#13;
system. However, as currently no measurements are made as to the causes of the delay (e.g. whether&#13;
evidence was not available, whether witnesses were not present, etc.), it provides little information as to&#13;
the causes of delays in the system. The project would assist in the development of computerized case&#13;
management which will permit easy case monitoring and follow-up and will produce the data required&#13;
to evaluate overall court performance. Also, pilot approaches will be undertaken to measuring the causes&#13;
of the underlying delays in order to pinpoint bottlenecks, identify key areas of resource requirements and&#13;
measure impact of various inputs.&#13;
26.   Measurement of project outputs. The specific outputs which would be monitored under the&#13;
project are detailed in Annex 3. In summary, these consist of specific tangible outputs which, of&#13;
necessity, mirror the inputs (e.g. Law Reports printed, reformed laws presented to Parliament) and also&#13;
other indicators which measure systemic improvements (e.g. backlog of cases cleared, ratio of legal&#13;
training undertaken locally as percentage of total training, service delivery and level of support received&#13;
from GOU by the devolved Administrator General and Registrar General).&#13;
Increased Cost Recovery&#13;
27.    Based on the recommendations made as part of the Ministerial Review for the MJCA,&#13;
Government has decided that in order to improve effectiveness and efficiency, the Department of the&#13;
Administrator General/Public Trustee and the Department of the Registrar General should be devolved&#13;
from Government. New corporate entities are to be established which would be self accounting and&#13;
would deliver services to the public on a cost recovery basis. These decisions of Government provide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 9 of 10&#13;
a unique opportunity to increase the level of cost recovery of the legal sector and the project will finance&#13;
studies and the resulting implementation plans for setting up and increasing cost recovery from the two&#13;
devolved Departments.&#13;
28.    Administrator-General's Department.  This department is charged with the responsibility of&#13;
administering the deceased persons' estates as well as insolvent estates, and also acts as a Public Trustee&#13;
for minors and legally incapacitated persons. For the services rendered by the department, it charges a&#13;
fee of 1 % at the time of the distribution of funds from the estate; this is low compared to the charges for&#13;
similar services in other East African countries (e.g. Kenya charges 10% and Tanzania 7%). The&#13;
department currently has sixteen professional positions with eleven lawyers on board. Its offices are&#13;
based only in Kampala and it has no up-country presence.&#13;
29.    The workload of the Department has grown in recent years due to two reasons: increasing&#13;
number of deaths from AIDS; and lack of legal literacy which results in intestate deaths. The caseload&#13;
has grown from 1153 in 1990 to 2422 in 1993. At the same time, the revenues earned from handling&#13;
such estates has grown from 300 million U Sh to 913 million U Sh; costs have also increased&#13;
substantially.&#13;
30.    A study is underway to recommend the modality for establishing the new entity (including&#13;
legislation required, organization structure, etc.) and review the various options for (a) improving service&#13;
delivery in locations outside Kampala; consideration would be given to delegating service delivery to the&#13;
district level as has been proposed earlier by the Ministry of Local Government; (b) increasing the level&#13;
of revenue for each transaction handled while keeping charges to the average Ugandan at low levels (e.g.&#13;
through a sliding scale percentage charge for services i.e. the higher the value of the estate, the higher&#13;
the percentage fee); (c) evaluate methods of containing costs; (d) propose a plan for computerization of&#13;
records management, accounting and budgetary control; and (e) make recommendations for increasing&#13;
the returns from financial and land assets under control of the Public Trustee. The study is beingfinanced&#13;
from the Project Preparation Facility. The outputs of the study would, inter alia, include a three-year&#13;
Business Plan. The condition of disbursement of funds to the Administrator-General's Office would be&#13;
the provision of a satisfactory business plan covering at least the first three years of operation.&#13;
31.    Registrar-General's Department. The main objectives of this Department is to attend to the&#13;
registration of: all businesses and companies in Uganda; births, deaths, etc.; and intellectual property&#13;
such as patents, copyrights and trademarks. Like all the other Departments within the MJCA the Office&#13;
of the Registrar faces a plethora of problems which constitute a hurdle in its proper and efficient&#13;
functioning. There is a chronic shortage of office supplies, more particularly registration forms which&#13;
form the basic tools of the Department's work. Modern equipment, such as computers, is lacking and&#13;
as a result the record keeping system as well as information storage is done manually. High vacancy rate&#13;
for support staff further compounds the situation.The number of cases handled per day has increased due&#13;
to the deaths resulting from AIDS as well as the increased economic activity occasioned by the current&#13;
Government policy. As a result the Department presently registers an average of four companies, eight&#13;
business names, five deaths and twenty five births per day. The amount of revenue collected by the&#13;
Department has increased from some 224 million U Sh in 1990 to 486 million U Sh in 1993; a large&#13;
proportion of this revenue is attributable to stamp duty. The growth of the volume of the Department's&#13;
work necessitates its operational expansion to the areas outside Kampala where it is presently based.The&#13;
scarcity of resources however, militates against this.&#13;

32.    A study similar to the one for the Administrator General is being conducted for the Registrar&#13;
General. The study will: (a) examine the modality for setting up the new entity including its organization&#13;
structure; (b) review the registration system and make recommendations for its streamlining. Particular&#13;
consideration should be given to the delegation of registration of births and deaths to the district level as&#13;
has been suggested earlier by the Ministry of Local Government; (c) draw up an Action Plan for&#13;
computerization of records management; (d) determine an appropriate rate structure and draw up a plan&#13;
for increasing cost recovery over the life of the project. The study is being financed from the Project&#13;
Preparation Facility. The outputs of the study would, inter alia, include a three-year Business Plan. 77Te&#13;
condition of disbursement of funds to the Registrar-General's Office would be the provision of a&#13;
satisfactory business plan covering at least the first three years of operation.&#13;
Parallel Donor Projects&#13;
33.    DANIDA is funding a project to provide assistance to the Judiciary and in the continued&#13;
construction/refurbishment of courts.  The commencement of this project is currently pending the&#13;
appointment of a Judicial Reform Commission since this a condition of effectiveness of that project.&#13;
34.    USAID is funding the part of the Law Revision exercise which relates to the consolidation of the&#13;
laws. The approach adopted will be an in-house effort in the Law Revision Commission. Two&#13;
Commissioners would be appointed by Statute to carry out the Revision exercise which is expected to be&#13;
completed over a period of three to four years.&#13;
35.    Upon completion of the Law Revision, the consolidated Laws of Uganda would be printed by&#13;
ODA. ODA is also reviewing its program to provide support to the Judiciary and to the Legal Sector;&#13;
the results of these two reviews would be used to decide upon whether ODA's ongoing programs to&#13;
support the Judiciary and the police would continue and the nature of the assistance may be revised at&#13;
that time.&#13;

UGANDA INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
ACCOUNTANCY PROFESSION STRENGTHENING COMPONENT&#13;
Background&#13;
1.           The development of accounting in Uganda has fallen behind the rest of Africa due to the&#13;
past lack of support from the Government of Uganda (GOU) in the formation of the accounting profession&#13;
and in the development of a local professional qualification. Uganda has a very small accounting&#13;
profession, with less than 100 professionally qualified accountants and a similarly serious shortage of&#13;
accounting technicians. The demand for accountants is very high, but because of the small numbers most&#13;
accounting jobs are filled by staff with no formal accounting qualifications who may not be capable of&#13;
carrying out the tasks assigned to them. In Government, the lack of qualified staff is exacerbated by the&#13;
low remuneration and consequently, Government has been unable to produce its own accounts on time.&#13;
2.           As a result of the mismatch between supply and demand, there is a heavy demand for&#13;
accounting education in Uganda. However, the only accounting courses currently offered in the public&#13;
sector are the Bachelor of Commerce Degree (accounting stream) at Makerere University and the&#13;
Diploma in Business Studies at the College of Business Studies in Nakawa. Both of these qualifications&#13;
are heavily oversubscribed. The only professional accounting qualifications available to Ugandans are&#13;
foreign ones: i.e. the Kenyan Certified Public Accountancy qualification or a UK qualification. While&#13;
some private colleges do offer study courses for both examinations, such courses are not readily available&#13;
for later stages of the qualifications. Hence, the majority of students undertake correspondence courses&#13;
or go overseas; either alternative results in the expenditure of large amounts of foreign exchange.&#13;
Further, the taxation and legal systems which are studied as part of the Kenyan and UK qualifications are&#13;
not relevant to Uganda and due to unfamiliarity with these systems, Ugandan students achieve a lower&#13;
pass rate in both examinations.&#13;
3.           Past Donor Support. In recent years, the GOU has realized that the development of&#13;
accounting is important for the economy. As a first step, it sought donor support in the form of discrete&#13;
projects aimed at improving the skills of specific cadres (i.e. accountants and auditors) within&#13;
Government. Under the IDA Economic and Financial Management Project government accounting and&#13;
auditing is being strengthened. The Office of the Auditor General is being assisted in : improving the&#13;
structure and organization of audit planning administration and the quality of the audit documentation;&#13;
introduction of specific audit techniques (e.g value for money auditing and auditing of parastatals and&#13;
local authorities); and a structured training program which would have the capacity to continue after the&#13;
project. The Office of Treasury Accounts is being assisted in: introduction of structured training for the&#13;
accounting cadre; improving the Treasury Inspectorate; and developing the internal audit function. Donor&#13;
support in the development of the profession and a local examination has consisted of two studies both&#13;
funded by ODA which laid out the next steps required in developing the profession and an examination.&#13;
4.           Based on the findings of the above studies, the accountancy profession worked with GOU&#13;
to legislate the necessary changes. In 1992, Government passed the Accountants Statute which established&#13;
the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Uganda to regulate the profession and maintain standards,&#13;
and the Public Accountants Examinations Board to conduct accounting examinations. Unfortunately,&#13;
during the passage of the Bill through Parliament, some changes were introduced which have led to&#13;
continuing disputes regarding the membership of the Institute.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
5.           Problems with the Statute.  The Statute allows for two categories of members: full and&#13;
associate. It also allows for those currently engaged in public practice to apply for a license to practice.&#13;
Only full members however, can vote at the Annual General Meeting, and be elected to the Council of&#13;
the Institute. Hence, while the Statute provides plenty of reassurance for all those currently engaged in&#13;
the practice of accounting that they would be able to continue to do so, it provides for a separate category&#13;
(i.e. full members) who would be expected to lead the profession. As with similar Acts, the Statute&#13;
includes a list of bodies whose members can be admitted into initial full membership, without the need&#13;
to take any additional examinations. The bodies included in the Bill presented to Parliament were&#13;
members of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). When the Bill was discussed in&#13;
Parliament however, four bodies were added to the list: the Association of International Accountants of&#13;
UK; the Institute of Chartered Managers and Administrators; the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and&#13;
Administrators; and the Institute of Certified General Accountants of Canada. These bodies, apart from&#13;
the Institute of Certified General Accountants of Canada, are not members of IFAC.&#13;
6.           Of particular concern to professional accountants was the inclusion of the Institute of&#13;
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators since, while qualified in the field of their specialization, the&#13;
Chartered Secretaries training does not prepare them to be professionally qualified accountants. Further,&#13;
since there are more Chartered Secretaries in Uganda than professionally qualified accountants, if&#13;
admitted as full members they could dominate the Institute. Not being led by professional accountants&#13;
would seriously hinder the development of the accounting profession in Uganda as well as reduce the&#13;
possibility of the Ugandan qualification being internationally accepted. The dispute continued for an&#13;
extended period of time and delayed the holding of the first General Meeting and the election of the&#13;
Council; without these two key steps, the ICPAU could not commence its activities.&#13;
7.    IDA's position, after extensive discussions with various interested parties was that the Institute&#13;
should be led by professionally qualified accountants. Consequently, IDA support for the ICPAU was&#13;
contingent upon the Government amending the Accountants Statute to remove three bodies from the Act&#13;
as eligible for full initial membership of the ICPAU; the Association of International Accountants of UK;&#13;
the Institute of Chartered Managers and Administrators; and the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and&#13;
Administrators. This change to the Statute, together with the holding of the AGM of the Institute and&#13;
the election of the Council were conditions of negotiation of the project. These have now taken place.&#13;
Component Objectives and Description&#13;
8.    As mentioned above the accounting profession in Uganda is very small and consequently does&#13;
not have the necessary resources or expertise to establish an active professional body. If ICPAU is to&#13;
effectively carry out the objectives of a professional body there is a need for external assistance. This&#13;
component aims to support the establishment of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Uganda,&#13;
and to provide the Institute with the assistance needed to accomplish its objectives.&#13;
9.     Commencement of ICPAU operations. The component would assist the ICPAU to commence&#13;
operations. The Governing Council of 12 members (eight elected, three ex-officio i.e. Commissioner&#13;
Treasury Office of Accounts, the Auditor General, the Commissioner of Education, and one member&#13;
appointed by the Minister of Finance) would be supported by the new administrative staff of the Institute&#13;
to fulfil the following functions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
a.    Admit members to the Institute, issue certificates and licenses of practice, maintain and&#13;
publish a list of members of the Institute.&#13;
b.    Approve courses of study and qualifications for registration, provide for the registration&#13;
of students, and supervise and regulate the practical training and education of registered&#13;
students.&#13;
c.    Ensure the maintenance of professional standards amongst members and take steps to&#13;
acquaint members with methods and practices necessary to maintain these standards,&#13;
regulate the conduct and promote good ethical standards and discipline of members.&#13;
d.    Promote the usage of internationally accepted accounting and auditing standards in&#13;
Uganda and to make suitable adaption where necessary.&#13;
e.    Secure national and international recognition of the Institute.&#13;
f.    Maintain a library of books and periodicals, and encourage publication of similar books&#13;
and periodicals in Uganda.&#13;
g.    Encourage research in accountancy.&#13;
10.   To estimate the resources required to commence the implementation of the above activities, the&#13;
Council of the ICPA U would draw up a business plan, covering at least the next three years. 7his plan&#13;
is a condition of disbursement of the component. In the interim, initial indications of the immediate&#13;
funding needs are:&#13;
a.    the post of Secretary (the administrative head of the Institute). This post would be filled&#13;
by an Ugandan who must be acceptable to IDA. Appointment is a condition of&#13;
disbursement of this component.&#13;
b.    Rental of a small set of offices, which would include the provision and stocking of a&#13;
small library.&#13;
c.    Office furniture and equipment.&#13;
d.    Short-term technical assistance, through a twin, to assist the Institute adapt international&#13;
accounting and auditing standards to be suitable for Uganda, and to devise a code of&#13;
professional ethics, and funding for publishing these for members, students, and the&#13;
business community.&#13;
e.    Funding for the development and introduction of continuing professional education&#13;
courses.&#13;
11.   Development of a local professional qualification and associated examination. The primary&#13;
modality for development of a local qualification would be to help the Council of the Institute and the&#13;
Examination Board design a scheme of examinations, with detailed examination syllabuses and reading&#13;
lists, and prepare and moderate examination papers. Funding would be provided for a twinning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
arrangement which would provide short-term technical assistance. Further funding would also be&#13;
provided for publishing the above and holding seminars to inform students and the teaching institutions&#13;
of the new courses. It is projected that the first course of study for the CPA examinations will commence&#13;
in September 1996 and the first examination will be held in June 1997.&#13;
12.   Self-financing. An important goal for the Institute will be to become self-financing. Currently&#13;
the membership base of the ICPAU is small, with approximately 100 full members and 60 associate&#13;
members. This will not provide the Institute with sufficient revenue to fund all its activities. A potential&#13;
source of income for the Institute and the Examination Board will be student registration and examination&#13;
fees. There are estimated to be about 1000 students in Uganda studying for external accounting&#13;
qualifications. When the Institute is able to offer national examinations it will be able to recruit students.&#13;
Building up a student base will take time however, as existing students may wish to continue with their&#13;
current studies rather than switch to the ICPAU examinations. As a result of this, it is unlikely that the&#13;
ICPAU will become self-financing by the end of the project, and additional sources of funding will have&#13;
to be sought. One of the objectives of the business plan referred to above is to review post-project&#13;
financing of the ICPAU. A condition of disbursement of this component will be the signing of a&#13;
Subsidiary Grant Agreement between GOU and the ICPAU.&#13;
Twinning Arrangement&#13;
13.    As Uganda does not currently have the expertise in running an Accountancy Association&#13;
especially with respect to establishing its own examinations, a twinning arrangement would be established&#13;
with another professional accounting body to help in this regard. The twin will be a member body of&#13;
the International Federation of Accountants, with a good track record of setting examinations, and&#13;
developing accounting and auditing standards. The twin will provide short-term in-country inputs as&#13;
needed. In addition, the Secretary will spend some time with the twin learning how it operates.&#13;
Continuing Professional Education&#13;
14.    Besides the introduction of a professional qualification those accountants already qualified see the&#13;
need for subsequent professional training. Many of them have received no further training since&#13;
qualification, and they realize that they have not kept up-to-date with new techniques. In addition, there&#13;
are many people practicing accounting who have had no formal training. The profession sees ICPAU&#13;
as playing an important role in professional development by offering seminars. Initially the Institute aims&#13;
to offer four CPE courses per year on matters of interest to the profession. A questionnaire will be sent&#13;
to all members to identify training needs. These courses will form the basis of a more extensive CPE&#13;
program, which the Institute hopes to introduce after it has gained experience under the project. The&#13;
CPE courses will be a source of revenue for the Institute.&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
15.   The Institute's Council will be responsible for implementing this component.&#13;

UGANDA INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION SKILLS TRAINING FUNDS&#13;
Background&#13;
1.           Training of Civil Service staff has in the past been undertaken in an ad hoc manner.&#13;
There has been no overall training plan for GOU staff and a large proportion of the training has been&#13;
undertaken through donor funding, often in the context of specific projects. Further, the past approach&#13;
to the improvement of delivery of training in Uganda has focused upon improving the available supply&#13;
of training. Specific institutions were chosen and assisted, primarily by donors, through provision of:&#13;
civil works, equipment and technical assistance (including through twinning arrangements), overseas&#13;
training and study tours. I This approach has had two main shortcomings:&#13;
a.    Public and private sector entities which constitute the demand for training have had only&#13;
a marginal input into the structure of courses being provided by the training institutions.&#13;
The only choice available to these institutions has been to send their staff to the available&#13;
local training or send their staff outside Uganda at a higher cost to be trained in more&#13;
relevant skill areas. The lack of market orientation on the part of the training institutions&#13;
was due to a low impetus for cost recovery. Since the training institutions were being&#13;
funded directly by Governrnent or donors, the need to get revenues from the trainees was&#13;
not an overarching objective. This in turn meant that tailoring courses to trainee needs&#13;
and improving capacity utilization were not important priorities. Hence, the available&#13;
local supply of training determined the demand for local training rather than the demand&#13;
for training driving the supply of training.&#13;
b.    Other than the few institutions supported by donor funding, there was no broad based&#13;
development of local training institutions since there was no functioning market for&#13;
matching demand and supply of training. This situation was further exacerbated by the&#13;
existing training institutions being able to offer lower prices since they received direct&#13;
subsidy from Government and/or subsidies in kind from donor funded civil works,&#13;
equipment, etc.&#13;
Project Approach and Objectives&#13;
2.           Demand Based Approach. Given the shortcomings of the past approach described above,&#13;
the project attempts to develop a demand based approach which places the funds in the hands of the&#13;
institutions needing the training and allows these institutions to define their requirements and subsequently&#13;
This assessment was made based on a study sponsored by the Capacity Building Secretariat (CBS)&#13;
in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning as part of the background work for the&#13;
preparation of the Government of Uganda's Capacity Building Plan. The report entitled Study&#13;
on Uganda Training Facilities and Impact on Performance was prepared by Development and&#13;
Management Consultants Inc., April 1991.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

allows training institutions to compete for the provision of training. This approach is being tested in other&#13;
recently begun IDA projects in other African countries 2, One modality has been to focus at the&#13;
individual trainee level i.e. place demand directly in the hand of trainees by providing them with training&#13;
vouchers and let them choose the institution where they desire to be trained. This approach is suitable&#13;
for technical and vocational skills training. The second modality has been to provide the funds to the&#13;
institutions needing training which can then define their demand. This approach is more appropriate for&#13;
job specific skills that benefit the organization to a greater extent than the individual trainee. These skills&#13;
are systemic implementation skills.&#13;
3.           Focus on Implementation Skills. The need for general management and implementation&#13;
skills, in addition to technical skills, has been a recurrent theme in Uganda's educational policies since&#13;
the late 1960s. During the following twenty years, a number of studies aimed at identifying skill gaps in&#13;
the economy were prepared, including the most recent example of a National Manpower Planning Survey&#13;
completed in 1989. 3  The lack of such skills are among the hindrances to the growth and&#13;
competitiveness of private sector organizations and the effective delivery of services by the public sector.&#13;
The proposed project will concentrate on building local capacity in those disciplines which focus upon&#13;
implementation i.e. general management, finance and accounting, procurement and computing skills. In&#13;
addition, given the focus on the legal sector, legal skills have also been included for funding.&#13;
4.           Support to A Larger Number Of Training Institutions. This is an important element of&#13;
the project approach. The purpose of this is to broaden the underlying base of training suppliers in the&#13;
local market as well as to focus on a segment of the market which has the potential to develop further&#13;
but has historically been excluded from receiving Government or donor support since it constitutes a&#13;
second tier of the training suppliers' market. While there would be direct provision of inputs as under&#13;
the past approach, the support would avoid the earlier pitfalls by: (a) identifying the suppliers to be&#13;
strengthened on the basis of their technical responsiveness to training needs of the local market; (b)&#13;
targeting the assistance on the basis of the supplier's self-defined requirements; and (c) requiring a&#13;
substantial level of cost sharing. This new approach to strengthening training institutions is also being&#13;
attempted under another IDA project under development&#13;

Component Objectives and Description&#13;
5.           This component will help establish a system to&#13;
a.    provide a demand based approach to improving the quality of training in implementation&#13;
skills; and&#13;
b.    improve the quality of training institutions supplying training in implementation skills.&#13;
6.    The component's objectives would be met through the establishment of two separate training&#13;
funds. The first fund would provide purchasing power to public and private sector institutions on a cost&#13;
sharing basis to competitively acquire their training needs from the local market. This fund would be&#13;
called the Public Sector and Private Sector Matching Grant Fund (Fund I). The second fund would be&#13;
available to selectively identified weak training institutions which would be assisted in strengthening&#13;
through staff training and acquisition of study materials and equipment on a cost sharing basis; it would&#13;
be called the Training Suppliers' Strengthening Fund (Fund II).&#13;
Institutional Framework&#13;
7.           This component would be managed and overall project administration would be&#13;
undertaken by the Capacity Building Secretariat. The component specific role is in line with the general&#13;
mandate identified for the CBS under the Ugandan Government's Capacity Building Plan i.e. to provide&#13;
the operational link between the training needs of public and private sector organizations and the training&#13;
providers. However, this necessitates the rebuilding of the CBS since while it has been in existence from&#13;
1991, it has been an ad hoc body and its members have full time duties elsewhere. The rebuilding&#13;
process has commenced with GOU appointing its Task Manager for the project as the Head of the CBS.&#13;
Further, the administration staff for the CBS have been identified and are expected to come from the&#13;
project office for the Economic and Financial Management Project. Staff dedicated to the training&#13;
programming, monitoring and evaluation are to be recruited. A short-term consultancy was undertaken&#13;
to define the Terms of Reference for the Training Funds component staff and prepare detailed guidelines&#13;
for the operation of Funds I and II and the impact evaluation. The process of recruiting Training Funds&#13;
component staff is underway.&#13;
Phasing of Implementation&#13;
8.           Once the Training Component Manager and staff are appointed it will be necessary for&#13;
them to be familiarized with the training processes through on-the-job training. This learning is expected&#13;
to occur during a pre-operational phase i.e. before the component begins disbursing funds. The proposed&#13;
approach is for the CBS to work closely with the Ministries of Public Service and Local Government as&#13;
these Ministries acquire training services for the Central Government and Local Government Capacity&#13;
Building components using the demand based procedures which are described in paras 11 through 13.&#13;
The CBS will then use this experience by acquiring training for the Legal Sector Reform and&#13;
Accountancy Strengthening components. After a sufficient period of on-the-job training has elapsed, the&#13;
capability of the CBS to implement operations under the Fund would be assessed. At the same time, the&#13;
implementation experience in Uganda (and other African countries where similar approaches are being&#13;
attempted) would be reviewed. Consequently, the condition of disbursement for the Training Funds&#13;
Component would be agreement between GOU and IDA that: (a) the CBS staff have demonstrated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
capability to implement the Training Funds component through (i) participation in the procurement of at&#13;
least two rounds of training under the Central or Local Government Capacity Building components and&#13;
(ii) satisfactory management of at least one round of training under the Legal Sector Reform or&#13;
Accountancy Strengthening components; and (b) the detailed guidelines in the Implementation Manual&#13;
pertaining to the implementation of the Training Funds component would have been reviewed and, if&#13;
warranted by the review, amended in the light of experience. It is expected that, based on the projected&#13;
schedule for hiring and training the Training Fund Component staff, the component would meet its&#13;
condition of disbursement no later than July 1, 1996 i.e. about one year after project effectiveness.&#13;
Assurances were also received at negotiations that a special review of the operations of the Training&#13;
Funds component would be undertaken after the end of the first year of operation of that component.&#13;
9.           Sensitization Seminars. Once a decision is made that the commencement of operations&#13;
under the component are imminent, the CBS would organize seminars to inform the local market about&#13;
the facility and to guide prospective participants on procedures required to acquire funding from: Fund&#13;
I for purposes of staff training; and Fund 11 for purposes of supplier strengthening.&#13;
The Public Sector and Private Sector Matching Grant Fund (Fund I)&#13;
10.          This fund would provide matching grants to public and private sector institutions for&#13;
training of their staff. For Central Ministries and Districts, Fund I would provide 90% of the resources&#13;
with 10% of the resources being provided by the Government entities; actual cost funded by Government&#13;
entities would be higher since training allowances would not be funded under this component.5 Private&#13;
sector organizations would access Fund I through trade/industry associations; the cost sharing&#13;
arrangement would be 50% of the costs of training to be provided by the private sector and 50% to be&#13;
provided by Fund I.  The fund would acquire training needs through a transparent and competitive&#13;
bidding process which will allow all local training institutions, both publicly funded and private, to&#13;
participate in service delivery as described in para 11 below.&#13;
11.          Approach for Procurement of Training Services under Fund 1. Procurement of training&#13;
services will commence with the submission of training requests in the designated skills areas by eligible&#13;
organizations (i.e. Central Ministries, districts or trade/industry associations) to the Capacity Building&#13;
Secretariat (CBS). The requirement for a cost sharing contribution will be the primary screening&#13;
mechanism for exclusion of gratuitous training requests. Requests from various entities would be&#13;
packaged on two criteria by the CBS. First, requests would be consolidated based on the skill area (e.g.&#13;
accountancy). Second, where the number of trainees in a given request may exceed the average capacity&#13;
of local training suppliers in the subject area, the training needs would be divided into two or more&#13;
requests for Training Services. After packaging the training plans, the CBS would request the training&#13;
services from suppliers by local advertisement. When proposals are received, an Evaluation Committee&#13;
would be set up to compare proposals and select the highest evaluated bidder based on the technical&#13;
proposal submitted (which would have a weightage of no less than 85 % of the evaluation points) and the&#13;
price of the proposal (which would have a weightage of a maximum of 15% of the evaluation points).&#13;
5  It is important to note that some Government ministries and districts would receive separate&#13;
training under other components which is required for the successful implementation of those&#13;
components.  If such Central ministries or districts require additional training, they can&#13;
participate under this Fund on the prescribed cost sharing basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
The Evaluation Committee would consist of the following: a representative from each benefiting&#13;
organization (i.e. Central ministry, district or trade/industry association), a member of the Training&#13;
Component staff of the CBS and an independent training expert to be appointed by CBS who would also&#13;
be acceptable to IDA.&#13;
12.           An important aspect of the selection process would be the technical evaluation criteria;&#13;
the categories for evaluation and the relative weights assigned to each category would be similar to those&#13;
normally designated in the selection of consultants under IDA  procedures.  Specifically, a large&#13;
proportion of the technical merit score would be based on:&#13;
a.     the quality of the technical proposal. The relevance of the training approach would be&#13;
the most important consideration. Factors considered would include training location&#13;
(e.g. on-the-job training for district staff vs. off-site training within district vs. training&#13;
in Kampala), customization (e.g. group training vs. individualized training, tailor-made&#13;
vs. standardized training, practically oriented vs. academic training);&#13;
b.     the experience of the firm and the instructors in delivering similar training. In the initial&#13;
stages, the CBS's principal information base would be from referees provided by the&#13;
training suppliers for similar work performed. However, as CBS develops its own&#13;
capability for training impact assessment (both through observation by its own staff and&#13;
through trainee evaluations), this information would also be used for purposes of&#13;
assigning marks to firms on this criteria.&#13;
13.           Once the best proposal has been selected, the CBS would verify the ability of the selected&#13;
supplier to deliver the service. This will necessitate the following steps to be undertaken by the CBS:&#13;
a.     verification of registration, accreditation and operating license and insurance;&#13;
b.     determination of the availability of trainers included in the technical proposals and&#13;
ensuring a sufficient ratio of professionally qualified staff in the relevant field of&#13;
expertise. A ratio of at least one professionally qualified staff for every fifteen to twenty&#13;
students proposed to be trained would be utilized to ensure a sufficient number of&#13;
trainers; and&#13;
c.     certification of physical facilities and equipment necessary to conduct training in the&#13;
selected subject area or evidence of ability to acquire such facilities (e.g. contingent&#13;
contracts) if the training contract is awarded to the supplier.&#13;
CBS would document its findings regarding the ability of suppliers to deliver on the contract and these&#13;
would be reviewed by IDA staff during project supervision.&#13;
14.            Timing of Operation and Size of Fund L. Fund I would commence operations in July 1996&#13;
and two rounds of training (July 1996 to June 1997 and July 1997 to June 1998) would be funded. Since&#13;
the fund is being piloted, it is difficult to completely estimate and satisfy all training needs and these&#13;
funds would be allocated on a first come first served basis. The primary mechanism for screening out&#13;
gratuitous training requests will be cost sharing. For Government organizations, the 10% of the cost of&#13;
training and funding of the training allowances (which are excluded from funding under this component)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
is expected to result in rationalizing requests. For private sector organizations, the delivery mechanism&#13;
(i.e. through registered industry/trade associations) and the higher level of cost sharing of 50% are&#13;
expected to achieve the same results.&#13;
The Training Suppliers' Strengthening Matching Grant Fund (Fund 11)&#13;
15.    This fund would be available to selected weak training suppliers to improve their service delivery&#13;
capacity. To qualify for support under Fund II, the training suppliers will have to be&#13;
a.     Majority locally owned;&#13;
b.     Receiving no other assistance from donor funded projects;&#13;
either c.     During the pre-operational phase of the component, the firm should have: (i) competed&#13;
for provision of training services under the Central and Local Government Capacity&#13;
Building components by submitting bids for at least 1/4 of the requests for training&#13;
services in one area of implementation skills; (ii) have consistently ranked within the 20&#13;
percent of the top technical marks during bid evaluation during the entire pre-operational&#13;
phase and not secured a single training contract from the Central or Local Government&#13;
Capacity Building Components.&#13;
or    d.      During the first year of the operational phase, the firm should have: (i) competed for&#13;
provision of training services under Fund I having submitted bids for at least 1/4 of the&#13;
requests for training services in one area of implementation skills; (ii) have consistently&#13;
ranked within the 20 percent of the top technical marks during bid evaluation during the&#13;
entire pre-operational phase and not secured a single training contract from Fund I.&#13;
16.          Each training supplier could receive assistance for staff training, acquisition of training&#13;
related study materials and books and equipment. There will be several checks and balances built into&#13;
the system to prevent misuse of strengthening funds. First, no suppliers which have won contracts under&#13;
Fund I will be eligible for funding under Fund II. Second, no funds would be provided directly to&#13;
training suppliers; all training, study material, books and equipment will be acquired on their behalf by&#13;
CBS through a competitive process. Third, cost sharing will be differentiated based upon the cost&#13;
element: training of trainers would be funded at 90%, study material and books at 50% and equipment&#13;
at 25%. Fourth, no expenditures on civil works or operating costs will be allowable under Fund II.&#13;
Fifth, in order to receive the services/equipment under the project, the institutions to be strengthened will&#13;
need to first provide their contribution to the CBS.&#13;
17.          Training institutions eligible to apply for funding under Fund II will submit their&#13;
strengthening (i.e. staff development/training and equipment) requests to the CBS. The proposals would&#13;
state the requirements for staff training in person-weeks while requirements for study material and&#13;
equipment would be sufficiently detailed to enable the CBS to procure the needed equipment. The&#13;
strengthening proposals would cover a twelve month period.  CBS would conduct the bidding and&#13;
selection processes similar to those described for Fund I training and complete selection. Advertising of&#13;
the requests for strengthening proposals may be made in other countries in the region to encourage&#13;
institutions with the capacity to deliver Training of Trainers to participate. Further, equipment purchases&#13;
would be made in accordance with IDA's International Competitive Bidding processes. The CBS will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
ANNEX 11&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
be required to physically inspect facilities and equipment provided under the project for use by suppliers.&#13;
Its findings would be formally documented and should be available to IDA during project supervision.&#13;
18.           Timing of Operation and Size of Fund 11. Fund II is expected to commence operations&#13;
at the beginning of the component. There are expected to be two rounds of assistance: at the start of&#13;
the component and one year thereafter. Based on the amount being allocated for each institution to be&#13;
strengthened and the number of training institutions in the local market which appear to be eligible for&#13;
strengthening on the basis of a survey, the size of Fund II has been set at $1 million.&#13;
Impact Evaluation&#13;
19.   As the CBS gains experience in administering the procurement processes for both Funds, its&#13;
emphasis would shift to impact evaluation. This will be undertaken in two ways. First, CBS staff will&#13;
observe the training sessions and assess the effectiveness of training delivery mechanisms as compared&#13;
to the technical approaches initially proposed. Second, the trainees would also provide their own&#13;
assessment of the course, the trainers and the applicability to their actual work. Both these assessments&#13;
are expected to feed back into the evaluation process and would be used in scoring some criteria of the&#13;
technical evaluation. Additionally, the data collected would be made publicly available to all institutions&#13;
interested in conducting training outside of the proposed project.&#13;
Training for Comnunuity-Based Groups&#13;
20.    As the decentralization program of the Government proceeds, the role of local communities in&#13;
defining and participating in service delivery is likely to increase. A comprehensive IDA sector study&#13;
of the Non Governmental sector in Uganda 6 indicated that the best approach to strengthening the ability&#13;
of the Community-Based Groups in Uganda was to use local and international NGOs as capacity&#13;
builders/trainers. Based on this concept, the Economic Development Institute has been assisting the&#13;
UNDP in developing a project which is projected to commence in January 1995 and be completed in&#13;
three years i.e. by December 1997.&#13;
21.    Commencing in January 1997, GOU and IDA would review the experience of the UNDP project.&#13;
If it has been successful in increasing the capacity of the CBGs in project planning and implementation,&#13;
then commencing in July 1997, a small sum ($250,000) would be made available for this initiative out&#13;
of Fund I.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Institutional Capacity Building will
            establish local institutional and human capacity to develop
            and implement public policy and support the growth of the
            private sector through: (a) support for the continuation of
            the Civil Service Reform; (b) assistance to the Government
            of Uganda in its decentralization program; and (c)
            strengthening the legal and financial accountability
            framework and institutions. The project will consist of five
            components: (i) central government capacity building; (ii)
            local government capacity building; (iii) legal sector
            reform; (iv) accountancy profession; and (v) training funds.
