ABSTRACT&#13;
Much has been made of the possible impact of OECD macroeconomic&#13;
policy on financial flows available to developing countries. Specifically,&#13;
the low domestic savings rates in many countries, together with&#13;
governments' own demands for funds in credit markets, may have raised the&#13;
overall cost of funds, "crowding-out" developing countries.&#13;
This paper reviews some of the evidence and concludes that the&#13;
crowding-out hypothesis is not likely. While government budget deficits&#13;
and borrowing have indeed been large in recent years, revenues and&#13;
expenditures, when cyclically adjusted, come very close to being in&#13;
balance. At non-recessionary levels of income, therefore, expenditure and&#13;
revenue policies are approximately appropriate. Moreover, a close&#13;
examination of expenditure categories and taxation policies does not reveal&#13;
a "structural" imbalance, such that future deficits, or growing deficits,&#13;
are ineviatble.&#13;
The causes of the decline in OECD savings rates are also examined&#13;
and are found to lie, to some extent, in disincentives which operate at&#13;
various levels to discourage savings, but not to structural, or inexorable&#13;
demographic, causes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
CONDENSE&#13;
On a beaucoup fait etat des consequences que pourrait avoir la&#13;
politique macroeconomique de l'OCDE sur les flux financiers a la disposi-&#13;
tion des pays en developpement. Plus precisement, la faiblesse des taux&#13;
d'6pargne interieure observee dans de nombreux pays, et la demande de&#13;
credit emanant des gouvernements eux-memes, a peut-etre fait monter le&#13;
prix de I'argent, "6vincant" les pays en d6veloppement.&#13;
Apres avoir examine certains faits, les auteurs de ce document&#13;
concluent que 1'hypothese de l'eviction est peu probable. En effet, en&#13;
depit de l'ampleur des deficits budgetaires et des emprunts des gouverne-&#13;
ments ces dernieres annees, les recettes et les d6penses, corrig6es de la&#13;
conjoncture, sont tres pres de s'6quilibrer. Par consequent, pour un&#13;
niveau de revenu ne refletant pas une situation de recession, les politi-&#13;
ques de recettes et de depenses sont relativement appropriees. De plus,&#13;
si on examine etroitement les cat6gories de depenses et les politiques&#13;
fiscales, on n'observe pas de desequilibre "structurel" tel que des&#13;
deficits, ou l'accroissement des deficits, soient inevitables a l'avenir.&#13;
Les auteurs recherchent 6galement les causes du fl6chissement&#13;
des taux d'6pargne de 1'OCDE et les trouvent en partie dans les facteurs&#13;
de dissuasion qui interviennent a differents niveaux pour decourager&#13;
l1'pargne, mais non pas dans des phenomenes structurels ou des faits&#13;
d*mographiques inexorables.&#13;
&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
Mucho se ha dicho acerca de los posibles efectos de las&#13;
politicas macroecon6micas de la OCDE sobre las corrientes financieras a&#13;
que tienen acceso los paises en desarrollo. Especificamente, es posible&#13;
que los bajos niveles de ahorro interno en muchos paises, junto con la&#13;
demanda de los propios gobiernos de fondos provenientes de los mercados de&#13;
credito, hayan aumentado el costo global de los fondos, desplazando asi de&#13;
ellos a los paises en desarrollo.&#13;
En este trabajo se examinan algunos de los elementos de juicio y&#13;
se llega a la conclusi6n de que la hip6tesis de desplazamiento es poco&#13;
probable. Si bien los deficit presupuestarios y emprestitos de los&#13;
gobiernos han sido en verdad cuantiosos en los uIltimos afios, los ingresos&#13;
y gastos, una vez ajustados ciclicamente, llegan muy cerca del punto de&#13;
equilibrio. For lo tanto, con niveles de ingresos no recesionarios, las&#13;
politicas de gastos e ingresos son aproximadamente adecuadas. Por lo&#13;
dermas, un anAlisis detallado de las categorias de gastos y politicas&#13;
tributarias no revela un desequilibrio "estructural" que haga inevitables&#13;
los d6ficit futuros o el crecimiento de los deficit.&#13;
Se examinan tambi6n las causas de la disminuci6n del ahorro en&#13;
los paises de la OCDE y se concluye que ellas yacen, en cierta medida, en&#13;
los desincentivos que actuian en diversos niveles y desalientan el ahorro;&#13;
no se pueden atribuir a razones estructurales o de indole demografica&#13;
inexorable.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
This Paper surveys the role of the public sector revenues&#13;
expenditures, budget deficits and debt in the context of trends in national&#13;
savings, to provide some quantification of the likely crowding out of&#13;
private investment if current trends in deficits and savings continue.&#13;
Section I outlines revenue trends, Section II those in public&#13;
expenditures, Section III the resulting trends in budget deficits, Section&#13;
IV those in national savings, and the final section looks at the&#13;
relationships of projected deficits to trends in savings.&#13;

Trends in Government Revenues&#13;
Trends in OECD central government revenues show that the share of&#13;
income taken by the central government has risen substantially in the past&#13;
period. Chart I outlines the trends for individual OECD countries since&#13;
1960. Dramatic increases have taken place across the board. Overall for&#13;
OECD countries taken together, the government's current revenues as a&#13;
percentage of GDP were only 28.3% in 1960. However, since then, this&#13;
share, which includes social security taxes and contributions, has risen&#13;
from 31.9% in 1970 to 37.2% in 1982.&#13;

Table III.1 outlines the trends in the composition of government&#13;
current receipts. The role played by direct taxes (personal and corporate&#13;
incomes taxes plus social security taxes) increased from 16.8% of GDP in&#13;
1965 to almost 24.6% of GNP in 1982. As a result, the fraction direct&#13;
taxes contributed rose from 57% of total government current revenues in&#13;
1965 to over 65% of government revenues in 1982. Meanwhile, indirect tax&#13;
burden decreased, from 13.0% of GDP in 1965 to 10.5% of GDP in 1982. While&#13;
the share of government revenues has increased as a portion of GDP, the&#13;
increase in government revenues has not been sufficient to match the growth&#13;
in government expenditures. This, as well as the differential growth rates&#13;
of the various revenue components away from indirect towards direct taxes,&#13;
especially personal income taxes and social security charges, has had&#13;
political repercussions and has made the job of fiscal policy much harder.&#13;

The reason for this changing composition was the shrinking buoy-&#13;
ancy of indirect taxes, which in many countries, grew less rapidly than&#13;
GDP, and the greater buoyancy of direct taxes. Taxes on households rose&#13;
faster than other types of direct taxes, implying a decline in direct&#13;
corporate taxes. Social security taxes grew even more rapidly than other&#13;
direct taxes.&#13;
Where indirect taxes have shown buoyancy, this has in many&#13;
countries, been due to the introduction of energy taxes in the 1970's.&#13;
Both oil exporters and oil importing countries have introduced energy tax&#13;
or royalties. For example, energy taxes are the primary indirect tax in&#13;
the UK, contributing 2.1% of GDP to the UK government receipts in 1981.&#13;
Other countries have also introduced energy taxes, notably, the US, where&#13;
their contribution was 1.3% of GDP, the Netherlands (3.6%) and Norway&#13;
(4.0%).1/ It is probably valid to say that, in the absence of these&#13;
energy taxes, the overall burden of direct taxes would have been higher&#13;
still.&#13;
Concern Over Growth in Public Sector Revenues&#13;
With the rising tax burden, there is now an increasing reluctance&#13;
among a number of OECD governments to garner additional revenues through&#13;
"fiscal drag".2/ In some ten of the 21 OECD countries, including the UK,&#13;
France and the Netherlands, there is now explicit indexing of the personal&#13;

income tax. In three others, Belgium, Spain and Switzerland, indexing&#13;
exists in a de facto manner, although it is not always applied. In the&#13;
U.S., indexing is expected to be introduced in 1985, barring policy&#13;
changes. This would leave only eight countries (including Japan and&#13;
Germany) un-indexed. These trends suggest that, in general, the prospects&#13;
of increased responsiveness of tax revenues to GNP is reduced. It has been&#13;
estimated that the elasticity of revenues to GNP, once full indexation of&#13;
income taxes takes place, could reduce the tax elasticity to less than&#13;
one. Coupled with this concern over direct taxes, there is substantial&#13;
resistance to increasing indirect taxes, because of their inflationary&#13;
impact, especially when inflationary expectations are latent.&#13;
To summarize, there appears to have been a secular change in both&#13;
the level and composition of government receipts in the seventies and also&#13;
in the responsiveness of revenues to GDP growth as a result of indexation&#13;
provisions on direct taxes, and inflationary concerns preventing increases&#13;
in indirect taxes. As a result, concerns are surfacing over a possible&#13;
"tax threshold."3/&#13;
3/ State and local taxes have not been included in the discussion. The&#13;
conclusion becomes stronger, if they are.&#13;

II. Expenditures and Expenditure Trends&#13;
This section analyses trends in general government public expend-&#13;
iture. The section begins by examining the changes over time in the&#13;
overall level of public expenditures relative to GNP. Then the changes&#13;
which have taken place in the composition of expenditures, disaggregating&#13;
expenditures into broad categories of public sector outlays, are examined.&#13;
The determinants of each of these expenditure levels are analyzed, and an&#13;
assessment of the extent to which cyclical factors, such as slow growth and&#13;
unemployment, have contributed to these levels of expenditure as compared&#13;
to the contribution made by structural factors such as the demographic&#13;
changes including growth in the non-working population, and programmatic&#13;
factors such as commitments made to growing benefit levels.&#13;
Level of Expenditures&#13;
The level of public expenditures in relation to GDP has risen&#13;
substantially since the 1960s for most OECD countries, from 28.7% of GDP in&#13;
1960 to over 40.6% of GDP in 1982. While this summary statistic obscures&#13;
the inter-country differences in expenditure levels, the trend of increase&#13;
has been common across countries. In Sweden, the share of expenditures&#13;
have risen from 31% of GDP in 1960 to 68% in 1980; in Germany the increase&#13;
has been from 32.0% of GDP in 1960 to 48% of GNP in 1982. In Japan, where&#13;
the proportion of government expenditure in GDP was lowest, the level has&#13;
doubled from 18% of GDP in 1960 to 35.2% in 1982, the same level as the&#13;
U.S.&#13;

Changing Composition of Expenditures&#13;
In addition to rapid increases in the overall level of public&#13;
expenditures the higher level has been accompanied by a change in the&#13;
composition of expenditures as well. Table III.3 shows trends in the&#13;
components of public expenditure since the early 1950's. Defense&#13;
expenditures have fallen sharply from their high levels of the 1950;s, and&#13;
presently comprise some 3.4% of GDP. Outlays on social goods, here defined&#13;
as education, health, housing has risen substantially. Expenditures on&#13;
education rose from 3.1% of GDP in 1954 to 5.3%, and 5.4% in 1973 and 1980,&#13;
respectively. The rapid increase in health expenditures is striking, from&#13;
1.3% of GDP in 1954 to 3.3% in 1973, and to 4.3% by 1980. Growth in&#13;
housing expenditures has also taken place, from 0.5% of GDP in 1954 to 1.4%&#13;
in 1980. Total outlays on social goods have risen from 4.9% of GDP in&#13;
1954, to 9.7% in 1973 and 11.1% in 1980.&#13;
Income maintenance payments, which includes pensions, sickness,&#13;
family allowances and unemployment transfer payments have also increased.&#13;
Pension expenditures have tripled, and now, at 7.6% of GDP represent the&#13;
largest expenditure category. Sickness expenditures have also risen;&#13;
Family allowances, by contrast, have not increased, falling from 0.8% of&#13;
GNP in 1973 to 0.6% in 1980. Unemployment expenditure have undergone a&#13;
striking rise--now making up 2.6% of GNP.&#13;
The final expenditure category--public debt interest has also&#13;
increased from 1.6% of GNP in 1954, to 1.9% in 1973 to 2.9% in 1980, the&#13;
latter a 53% increase in 7 years.&#13;

Expenditure elasticities are higher than the revenue&#13;
elasticities4/; the overall expenditure elasticity is 1.25, for the&#13;
1970-80 period. Defense expenditures have grown, but only about as rapidly&#13;
as GNP. (This may have increased since 1980). The largest elasticity&#13;
attaches to "income maintenance programs", and of these, it is the increase&#13;
in pension expenditures which has been the largest factor. Income&#13;
maintenance programs have grown almost 40% faster than GNP. Next most&#13;
rapidly growing have been interest expenditures, with an elasticity of&#13;
1.37. This was followed by health expenditures, with an elasticity of&#13;
1.3. Education expenditures increased at a faster rate than GNP, some with&#13;
a 1.14 elasticity.&#13;
Social Goods Expenditures - Levels and Statistical Profile&#13;
Government outlays on "social goods" have grown rapidly in almost&#13;
all OECD countries. Included in this category are expenditures on:&#13;
health, education, sickness, and housing. Table III.4 shows the proportion&#13;
of total expenditures in these 3 areas from 1960-1980, for the major OECD&#13;
countries. In 1960, education outlays absorbed 12.6% of total government&#13;
spending, followed by health (6.3). By 1980, these had risen to 15.0,&#13;
13.0, respectively. For each country shown in Table III.4, governments'&#13;
social goods expenditures also increased as a percent of GNP in the period&#13;
1960-81. For the major countries, the share nearly doubled, from 6.12% of&#13;
GDP in 1960 to 12.1% in 1981. Thus, one eighth of all the resources&#13;
generated in OECD countries are presently being directed towards social&#13;
goods expenditures. In relation to total public expenditures,&#13;

outlays on social goods rose from 20.2 of total public expenditure in 1960&#13;

countries. Taking the countries together, the following picture emerges&#13;
for transfer expenditure in this period. In 1960, pension expenditure was&#13;
the largest sub-component of total expenditure (16%). Family benefits&#13;
absorbed 2.1% of total expenditure, with unemployment taking the smallest&#13;
share, 2.0%. The ordering has changed little since then, although the&#13;
percentage shares of some of the sub-component has. The pension share has&#13;
risen slightly to 20.7% of social expenditures, followed by expenditure on&#13;
family allowances (2.8) and unemployment at 2.4% of public expenditure.&#13;

Determinants of Social and Income Maintenance Expenditures&#13;
The specific determinants of expenditure levels in each of the&#13;
subcomponents discussed earlier vary by country. However, there are&#13;
strategic factors common to all countries, which together determine expendi-&#13;
ture levels. These include: demographic factors, levels of eligibility and&#13;
coverage, demand or takeup of benefits, levels of benefits, and economic&#13;
conditions. Inflation is an important determinant of expenditures, as are&#13;
improvements in technology. The magnitude of these elements have been quan-&#13;
tified in an OECD study6! (see Table III.7). In both periods, the primary&#13;
contributor to increased social goods expenditures as well as transfers was&#13;
increased benefit levels. Moreover, real increases in benefit levels were&#13;
more important than the effects of increases in prices on benefit levels.&#13;
In the 1960-75 period, eligibility growth or increases in&#13;
coverage, and demographic change equally contributed just over 40% of the&#13;
increase of total expenditure up to 1975 and higher benefit levels&#13;
contributed 60%. In the past 6 years, 1975-81, demographic factors&#13;
contributed about 18% to increases in social expenditure; eligibility&#13;
factors only 5%, and increased average benefit levels about 73%.&#13;
The relative impact of these factors of course varies according&#13;
to the program. The following sections seek to analyze the factors contri-&#13;
buting to growth in individual expenditure programs. Finally, some&#13;
prognosis is made to trends to 1990, given past patterns, assumptions about&#13;
future demographic trends, and finally, political and managerial changes&#13;
which might affect future levels.&#13;

Determinants of Expenditures on Social Goods: Health expenditures&#13;
Three principal features of the development of overall expendi-&#13;
tures health services have been (1) rapid growth of expenditure by&#13;
individuals, (2) changes in the way health expenditure have been financed,&#13;
leading to a substantial increase in the share financed by government,&#13;
(3) rapid improvement in technology.7/&#13;
The rapid growth in expenditures, as Table III.7 illustrated, has&#13;
had most to do with increases in "benefit levels", i.e., health expendi-&#13;
tures per person. In the 1960-75 period, real average benefits grew at&#13;
over 5.5% per annum, in 1975-81, of 1.8%, accounting for 55% of the&#13;
increase in health expenditures. At the same time, the price of health&#13;
care increased relative to other prices (the increases in health care costs&#13;
were 50% greater than the overall expenditure deflator), so that a fraction&#13;
of these higher expenditures were compensating for higher costs (or higher&#13;
quality and standards) of health care. In both periods the importance of&#13;
demographic factors was very small (less than 10%).&#13;
Technical change has increasingly been associated with greater&#13;
hospital use and hospitals now account for over 50% of total health care&#13;
costs and 40% of public-financed costs, and specialization of secondary&#13;
personnel. In many OECD countries, all this has developed in a cost&#13;
vacuum, with little thought given to the costliness of procedure, and&#13;
little political thought has been directed to the "screening" of access to&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
health procedures.8/ The result has been increasing concentration of&#13;
health services, with an estimated 50% of total health expenditure consumed&#13;
by 3-4%9/ of the total population. This unwillingness to decide who shall&#13;
receive publically-paid-for care, instead, allowing access of all, has&#13;
contributed significantly to the uncontrolled expansion of per-individual&#13;
health care costs. Coupled with this, have been the proclivities of the&#13;
health care profession, who also encouraged "best practice" medicine to be&#13;
the standard which patients demand without any consideration of costs.&#13;
Table III.8 outlines the components of real expenditure on health since&#13;
1960.&#13;
8/ In this context, it is interesting to note that improved access has&#13;
been reflected in both greater numbers of hosiptal admissions and&#13;
longer stay per admission: This is so in spite of higher incomes and&#13;
"better health" since 1960. The footnote table makes this clear:&#13;

Pharmaceutical costs have risen the most rapidly, with large drug&#13;
costs in part the result of capitalization of enormous R&amp;D expenditures&#13;
into drug prices and into the prices of medical machinery, followed by&#13;
growth of hospital services next. Increases in eligibility contributed&#13;
less to increased expenditure in the 1970s; largely because desired&#13;
coverage had been achieved in most OECD countries by the end of the 1960s,&#13;
a period in which rapid extension of coverage took place, with the&#13;
introduction of public programs in a number of countries. By the 1970s,&#13;
either employment linked private insurance, or universal access health&#13;
services covered the bulk of the OECD population.&#13;

However, demographic factors contribute about 10% of total growth&#13;
of health care expenditure, and the proportion of health care expenditure&#13;
following on demographic change is expected to rise in the future. Table&#13;
III.9 outlines the relative public expenditure on the aged, as a percent of&#13;
expenditure on the population under 65.&#13;

document for the Ad Hoc Experts Group on Health Policy and&#13;
Health Systems in March 1982 (SME/SAIR/HI/81.03).&#13;
As Table III.9 indicates, expenditures on aged population are some 4-8&#13;
times greater than expenditure on under 64 population for hospital care,&#13;
and for ambulatory care, they are twice as great, on average. With average&#13;
old age population growing in OECD countries by about 1/2% p.a. (far less&#13;
than population growth), the potential upwards pressure in public health&#13;
expenditure is sizeable, unless changes on health care delivery are made.&#13;
The table also shows a striking variance in expenditures across&#13;
countries. Notably, expenditures in the U.S. on the aged are some two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
times higher than the average for the other countries, whether on hospital&#13;
care, ambulatory care or medicines. While some of this may be due to&#13;
"quality" of care, it also has to do with cost-structures and pricing of&#13;
health care. The variance suggests that there is scope for containing this&#13;
category of expenditure, without compromising quality.&#13;
Determinants of Social Goods Expenditure: Education&#13;
In virtually all OECD countries, the proportion of the populace&#13;
of educable age is shrinking. In the past, growth of expenditure on&#13;
education increased at 6.1% per annum, but since 1975, expenditure on&#13;
education has decelerated substantially, growing at only 1.8% per annum.&#13;
As with health expenditure, education benefit levels--or increases in real&#13;
expenditure per pupil--were the primary cause of this increase. The&#13;
difference before and after 1975 was that in the recent period, demographic&#13;
factors, such as the decline in births and school age population, reduced&#13;
by half the impact of the increases in benefit levels on overall education&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
Determinants of Income Maintenance and Transfer Expenditures: Pensions and&#13;
Social Insurance&#13;
Expenditure on pensions and social security is both the largest&#13;
sub-component of OECD goverments' expenditure, and also the fastest&#13;
growing. As a percent of public sector expenditure in OECD countries,&#13;
pensions now absorb 19.4% (8.8% of GDP), and have increased at a rate of&#13;
over 6% in real terms since 1975.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Social security expenditure is largely a function of the number&#13;
of beneficiaries and the level of pension paid them. The former, in turn,&#13;
is related to the number of the aged population, and those aged who are&#13;
eligible for this transfer program. In accounting for increased&#13;
expenditure levels, it is clear from Table I11.10 that the bulk of&#13;
increased expenditure is due to rapid growth in benefit levels, i.e., in&#13;
the real value of pensions paid, which may be a function of past earnings&#13;
and labor participation (in semi-insurance systems) or some publicly&#13;
determined pension level (in the universal schemes). In either case,&#13;
pensions are frequently related to or tied to previous earnings, the&#13;
so-called "replacement ratio". Table III.10 shows how replacement ratios&#13;
have risen since 1965. The increase has averaged 50% over the 15-year&#13;
period, or 4% increase in real terms per annum. In a number of countries,&#13;
this was due to advantageous changes in the pension indexation formula, or&#13;
in the earnings base used to calculate previous earnings levels (France,&#13;
Japan, UK, Italy). In others, it has been the result of the introduction&#13;
of new schemes (Sweden). In two countries (Denmark and Japan), there has&#13;
been an erosion of pension level since 1965, and in Germany since 1969. It&#13;
is interesting to note that social security benefit levels were entirely&#13;
protected from inflation; on average, changes in relative prices did not&#13;
adversely affect real benefit levels.&#13;

Demographic changes also had an impact on growth in social&#13;
security expenditure, accounting for just under 30% of the increase in&#13;
social security expenditure. The proportion of overall growth due to&#13;
demographic factors was slightly greater in the latter period, this though&#13;
differs substantially by country. In a number of OECD countries,&#13;
(Australia, New Zealand, Italy) there is virtually no aging of the&#13;
population. In future years, after 2000, demographic factors will be the&#13;
most important factor contributing to overall pension expenditure levels.&#13;
Increases in eligibility have contributed least to growth in&#13;
social security expenditures in the latter 1975-81 period. This reflects&#13;
the fact that increases in coverage, introduction of new schemes, reduction&#13;

in pensionable age and provisions of early retirement had, in most OECD&#13;
countries, all been introduced by 1975.&#13;
The implications of this for future levels of social security&#13;
expenditure are outlined at the end of this section. Briefly, however,&#13;
with social security expenditure the largest percentage of public social&#13;
expenditure, and the fastest growing, the demographic changes overtaking&#13;
OECD countries suggest that social security expenditure may at some point&#13;
have to be constrained. This burden will not develop in the near future,&#13;
as the demographic component of social security expenditure, over the next&#13;
10-20 years, will remain relatively stable. The major growth is expected&#13;
after the turn of the century. Only in Japan is an aging population&#13;
already a reality. Table III.11 shows the proportion of the population&#13;
expected to be in the 65+ age group in the present and in the years 2000&#13;
and 2020 rising from 11.3% in 1980 to 16.5% in 2020.&#13;

Attempts to reduce pension expenditure have revolved around two&#13;
measures: the first is increases in retirement age (i.e., reduction of&#13;
eligibility) or adjustments to pensions which provide incentives to retire&#13;
later (normally, the trend has been the opposite: towards a lowering of&#13;
the retirement age. In the US the present plan is to raise the retirement&#13;
age to 66 in the year 2000. This type of adjustment will not have a major&#13;
effect in the shortrun. Another measure is reduction in the rate of&#13;
increase of benefits. Typically this would take place via a change in the&#13;
indexation formula. Germany, the U.S., the U.K. have done this; the former&#13;
two countries have corrected for past overindexation.&#13;
Determinants of Transfer Payments: Unemployment Compensation and Insurance&#13;
Unemployment insurance expenditure make up a relatively small,&#13;
but growing share of GNP. In 1960, unemployment expenditure made up 0.4&#13;
percent of GDP; by 1975, it had almost tripled to 1.1%. In the period to&#13;
1975, it was thus the fastest growing sub-component of social expenditures,&#13;
growing at 12% per annum. From 1975 to 1981, expenditure growth was less&#13;
rapid, although in the 1982-83 period, it has again increased.&#13;
Contributing to the rapid growth to 1975 were, almost equally,&#13;
increased benefit levels and demographic changes. In the recent period,&#13;
demographic changes--i.e., growth in the labor force, have been the primary&#13;
force behind growth in expenditures.&#13;
Also striking from Table III.7 is the negative impact on expenditures due&#13;
to reduced eligibility in the post-1975 period, as growing numbers of&#13;
workers became unemployed for longer periods and benefits ran out.&#13;

Social Goods and Transfer Expenditures" Controlling Future Growth&#13;
Equity Impact of Social Expenditures&#13;
The general consensus on the impact the "welfare state" has had&#13;
in reducing poverty and income inequality would clearly be that the old,&#13;
the poor, are better off. There is, however, evidence that the increasing&#13;
expenditure in the 1960's and 1970's has not been accompanied by the equity&#13;
gains one might expect, as reflected in, for example, lower morbidity&#13;
rates, lower mortality rates or increased equality in the distribution of&#13;
income.0_/ It appears that the underlying inequities in the distribution&#13;
of income and wealth are stubborn and that redistributive social programs&#13;
have limited ability to reduce or change them. In sum, the consensus seems&#13;
to be that government involvement of a more limited sort, at far lessercost&#13;
could have achieved very nearly the same results.&#13;
Efficiency&#13;
One point which has repeatedly been made is that the gross costs&#13;
of social programs are substantially greater than the net benefits to&#13;
recipients. The table below outlines the gross expenditures and net&#13;
benefits flowing to different levels of the income distribution. What is&#13;
clear is that social goods expenditures and transfer payments assist not&#13;
only the very poor, or even the fairly poor, but that much of the benefit&#13;
actually goes to those middle classes whose taxes finance the&#13;

What the chart shows is that, in principle, the same redistri-&#13;
bution (net flow) could be achieved with much reduced gross flows. What&#13;
makes any shift in redistribution difficult, however, is precisely that&#13;
across almost all levels of the income distribution, there is dependency on&#13;
these social programs and these constituencies are important. As our OECD&#13;
study points out, income-support benefits are often extended to the non-&#13;
poor, so as to avoid high marginal tax rates and accompanying disencentives&#13;
implied by rapid withdrawal of benefits as incomes rise. Stigler12/ has&#13;
concluded that this sort of "churning" of resources is necessary if a&#13;
political consensus in favor of redistribution policy is to evolve. The&#13;
middle class will not continue paying for social programs if they, too, do&#13;
not have some access. This may explain the absence of "tax revolt" in many&#13;
European countries where access to public social services is broad based,&#13;
by contrast to the US,where health programs, higher education grants and&#13;
medicare are limited to those satisfying fairly strict eligibility&#13;
criteria.&#13;
These inefficiencies have highlighted another concern, namely the&#13;
excess burden" inefficiencies which social programs generate. The&#13;
behavioral changes on the part of recipients which result from government&#13;
intervention, in turn often feed back on higher costs. These&#13;
inefficiencies are most often pointed out in the case of health care, where&#13;
service may be over-consumed as the user's perception of the value of the&#13;
service is divorced from the cost of providing it,13/ in unemployment&#13;

insurance which has been alleged 14/ to induce the unemployed to increase&#13;
their job search time and their period of unemployment, and in the case of&#13;
pensions, have induced a trend to earlier retirement. In each case, these&#13;
behavioral changes increase the costs and extension of the publicly&#13;
financed programs.&#13;
Outlook to 1990 and Beyond&#13;
Growth of social and transfer expenditure in the 1980's and&#13;
1990's, and the pressures this growth will engender, will be a function of&#13;
policy changes, economic conditions and demographic changes. The former&#13;
determine both the economic base which will be available to generate the&#13;
resources required, as well as the rate at which (indexed) expenditures&#13;
grow. The latter determine the structural changes in the level of demand&#13;
for committed benefits which may be expected.&#13;
Drawing on OECD studies, this section discusses the outlook to&#13;
1990 for the level of social and transfer expenditures in OECD countries,&#13;
given certain assumptions about economic growth and demographic change.&#13;

The study assumes that the level of social and transfer&#13;
expenditure relative to GNP (22.8% in major OECD countries in 1982) has&#13;
reached a threshold level and will not be increased. 15/ It also assumes&#13;
that there will be no increased coverage and that eligibility will not&#13;
increase, as the extension of most social programs in OECD countries is&#13;
already large. Demographic changes, however, are incorporated, as are&#13;

Because demographic changes and movements in relative prices are&#13;
adverse, holding the ratio of social and transfer expenditure to GNP&#13;
constant implies a decline in the rate of increase of real benefits (Column&#13;
6) relative to GNP. In the scenario which is optimistic about growth (the&#13;
scenario with lower unemployment, higher productivity growth and GNP&#13;
growthg 1% higher than under pessimistic scenario), the decline in real&#13;
benefit growth is of the order of 0.2% per annum. In other words, real&#13;
benefit levels grow 3.5% per annum while GDP grows 3.7% per annum.&#13;
Historical growth of real average benefit levels in from 1960-75 was 3.7%,&#13;
from 1975-81, 2.65% per annum. In the pessimistic scenario (unemployment&#13;
at 1982 levels, GNP growth at 1980-82 rates) the growth of real benefit&#13;
levels, given a constant share of social expenditure to GNP, and given&#13;
demographic change, is 0.6% per annum less than the growth of GDP. That&#13;
is, real benefit levels grow 2.2% per annum, while GDP grows at 2.8%. Most&#13;
likely these slower rates of growth would be achieved by an (under)&#13;
indexing of benefits to less than real earnings growth. As the OECD study&#13;
points out, these figures are broad averages across all social and transfer&#13;
programs, and across countries. The actual changes in expenditure levels&#13;
which take place are likely to vary by country and by program, in line with&#13;
each country's priorities and constraints. The conclusion, however, that&#13;
only a small reduction in the real growth of benefit levels can achieve a&#13;
stabilization of expenditures relative to GNP is encouraging. Expenditure&#13;
growth at a rate which implied real benefit growth at the same rate as GNP,&#13;
on the other hand, would imply a 25% share in GDP by 1990. This share&#13;
would be greater still if governments desired to increase coverage or&#13;
eligibility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
There are two important caveats to this conclusion. The first is&#13;
that there may in fact be substantial increases in demand for these social&#13;
goods from new sectors of the population who have previously not had&#13;
access, or not had adequate access. The analysis hence has assumed that&#13;
these demands can be contained and that there will be no increases in&#13;
coverage or eligibility. (Alternatively, through better targetting, these&#13;
demands could be met with no increases in costs.) The second caveat is&#13;
that the analysis refers to a "steady state" scenario. If for example,&#13;
there is a sharp supply-side shock to the system, and income falls,&#13;
expenditure levels will probably remain nearly constant, and their share&#13;
will rise in consequence.&#13;
The previous example assumed that the ratio of social expenditure&#13;
to GNP would remain constant at its 1982 level. A more stringent set of&#13;
measures implemented by governments wishing to constrain social&#13;
expenditures might place the burden of budgetary adjustment on social&#13;
expenditures. The table below indicates the cut in social expenditure&#13;
required to balance overall OECD budgets.&#13;

If the burden of budgetary adjustment were to be put on social and transfer&#13;
expenditures, a decline of some 18% would be required in the social&#13;
expenditure category, from 22.8% of GDP to 18% of GDP. The question of&#13;
course is whether budgetary policy can be made by full adjustment on the&#13;
expenditure side.&#13;
Yet another alternative is to examine the implication of a zero&#13;
real increase in benefit levels (i.e., constant benefit levels). In this&#13;
instance, benefit levels would be adjusted to any increase in relative&#13;
prices and overall expenditure would also rise in line with demographic&#13;
movements. However, there would be no real increase in benefits levels.&#13;
Again, no increases in coverage are assumed. Table III.14 outlines the&#13;
implications for social expenditure as a share of GDP.&#13;

If no real increase in average benefit levels takes place, social&#13;
expenditure could be reduced to some 17% of GNP by 1990, on the demographic&#13;
assumptions outlined earlier, and given the optimistic GNP growth of 3.7%.&#13;
If average real benefit levels are not permitted to grow and expenditures&#13;
rise only to cover demographic changes and relative price increases, but&#13;
GDP grows at the slower rate of 2.8%, the share will fall to 18.5% of GDP.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
In sum, it appears that there is some slack in social and&#13;
transfer expenditure programs. If real benefit levels remain constant in&#13;
real terms, the social expenditure burden can be substantially reduced. If&#13;
the share remains constant, real average benefits can grow by 3.5%, only&#13;
0.2% less than the rate of growth of real earnings implying that recipients&#13;
do share in the fruits of economic growth. What will be required is&#13;
political will, and development of policy alternatives, especially better&#13;
targetting. All these elements will be required, because such a shift will&#13;
imply a change from past trends in benefit growth and in people's&#13;
expectations of entitlements. Implied in the optimistic scenario is a&#13;
growth of real benefit levels of 3.5%, compared with a growth rate in&#13;
1960-75 of 3.7%. Nonetheless, the optimistic scenario implies faster&#13;
growth in benefit levels (2.8%) than actually took place in 1975-81.&#13;
The more restrictive scenarios imply a more radical change from&#13;
past trends, i.e., the zero real benefit increase represents quite a&#13;
departure even from the 2.8% growth rate of benefits from 1975-81.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
The feasibility of this rests, as noted earlier, on two crucial&#13;
assumptions, namely (i) that new entitlements are not granted (or if they&#13;
are, that targetting compensates for any such changes). No increases in&#13;
coverage or If governments find this impossible to stick with, then the&#13;
future augurs much less well for containing budget deficits through&#13;
expenditures policy. And (ii) no further supply shocks take place.&#13;
The following section completes the examination of OECD expendi-&#13;
ture trends with a discussion of trends in interest payments.&#13;
Debt Interest&#13;
Table 6 indicated the share of government debt interest payments&#13;
in total government expenditure. After government expenditure on the very&#13;
broad category of "social goods and transfers", the largest share of public&#13;
outlays goes to debt interest. The overall OECD average is close to&#13;
equalling outlays on defense expenditure for many countries. This is a&#13;
tremendous change from the not too recent past, when interest on the public&#13;
debt was generally half its present level. Table 18 shows this trend since&#13;
.1970. 16/ For major OECD countries, the share of interest in government&#13;
expenditure rose 56%, from 4.9% of expenditure to 8.8% of expenditure. For&#13;
some countries, such as Japan, the UK, and Australia, was about half again&#13;
as high, and in a few countries (Canada, Belgium, Italy) the proportion&#13;
approached 18% in 1982.&#13;

This rapid growth was a function of 3 factors: (i) rapid growth&#13;
of government deficits financed by borrowing, (ii) increases in nominal&#13;
interest rates during the period, and (iii) declining inflation which has&#13;
resulted in higher real interest rates. The discussion which follows draws&#13;
on OECD studies of this area. 17/&#13;
Public Debt&#13;
The first factor is perhaps the most important. OECD debt and&#13;
deficits are discussed in greater detail in Section D. Briefly, however,&#13;
the growth of outstanding debt has been rapid in recent years. Table 19&#13;
shows the ratios of central government debt to GDP, from 1960-1980, and&#13;
total government debt for the years 1975 and 1981. Central government debt&#13;
to GDP ratios decreased from 1960 to 1970, largely because of the erosion&#13;
of real debt levels due to inflation, and then increased between 1975 and&#13;
1980. (See also Table 21).&#13;
Most countries shown experienced an increase in their central&#13;
government debt/GNP ratios between 1975 and 1981. Total government debt to&#13;
GNP ratios have also risen in the past 5 years. Likely future growth in&#13;
this ratio is a function of future growth in government deficits and the&#13;
manner in which governments chose to finance them, and future inflation.&#13;
The alternatives and likely trends are discussed further in Section D on&#13;
trends in OECD deficits.&#13;

Nominal Interest Rates&#13;
As a result of the higher nominal interest rates prevalent in&#13;
OECD in the recent past, the interest burden component of government&#13;
expenditure rose substantially. Table III.17 shows trends in the long-term&#13;
bond rate of major OECD countries. With the exception of countries such as&#13;
Germany and Japan, these have tripled, or doubled, between 1965 and 1982.&#13;

The higher real interest rates which have been required recently&#13;
for the government to raise debt are due to a variety of factors. Because&#13;
inflationary expectations are still high inspite of the restrictive&#13;
monetary environment, bond holders require higher real yields for the risk&#13;
they take on. This insistence on higher real yields is reinforced by the&#13;
fact of growing government debt which carries with it fears that the debt&#13;
will be monetized, causing higher inflation. In sum, new debt is issued,&#13;
and refinanced debt is rolled over, at higher real rates and is now&#13;
beginning to put pressure on even low inflation countries such as Japan,&#13;
Germany and Austria. Moreover, as real interest rates rise and the&#13;
interest burden is financed, it is capitalized into outstanding debt, and&#13;
the effect rapidly becomes cumulative.&#13;
OECD has carried out a study estimating the contribution to the&#13;
growth of the debt, made by these factors. 18/ The components are outlined&#13;
in Table III.18 26 which shows the contribution of (1) inflation,&#13;
(2) interest payments, and (3) borrowing requirements, to increased&#13;
indebtedness, for 6 OECD countries. Statistics are not comparable with&#13;
those in Table III.16 as this latter study refers exclusively to central&#13;
government debt. In column (1), the table shows the proportion of&#13;
government debt to GNP. The second column outlines the total change in the&#13;
share. Column (3) begins the disaggregating, showing the estimates of the&#13;
effect of inflation on (reducing) the real value of the debt/GDP ratio. In&#13;
all cases, the impact of inflation has been to erode the real value of the&#13;
debt, sometimes quite substantially, as in the UK and Canada.&#13;

In column 4, the estimated effects of debt interest payments are&#13;
shown. As noted earlier, higher real interest rates have been required to&#13;
compensate bond-holders for potentially higher risk of taking a capital&#13;
loss on their bonds. In the past ten years, in most countries, the effect&#13;
of real interest rates on debt to GDP ratios has been larger than that of&#13;
increased borrowing requirements. Exceptions to this are Germany and&#13;
Japan, whose debt and GDP ratios rose most.&#13;
Finally, the increased public sector deficits have, been a&#13;
contributor to overall growth of debt as well. The role of the higher&#13;
borrowing requirement, net of interest payments, is shown in column 5.&#13;
Finally, the last column shows real rates of return on central&#13;
government debt. In most countries, (Germany excepted) the real rate of&#13;
return on government debt has been negative for almost a decade. There is&#13;
some evidence that it is becoming less so, however. Tentative figures for&#13;
1982 and 1983 (not shown) suggest that real rates are becoming highly&#13;
positive, and as a result, are contributing substantially to growth in&#13;
government debt.&#13;
Summary&#13;
Social expenditures and debt interest have been the largest&#13;
factors accounting for the growth in budget deficits. This survey suggests&#13;
that both of these factors have structural elements, but that there is some&#13;
room for containing, especially in social expenditures. Interest&#13;
expenditures, of course, have a dynamic of their own.&#13;

This summarizes trends in the important components of government&#13;
expenditure since 1970. The following section will look at and discuss the&#13;
trends in, and implications for, government deficits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The Deficits&#13;
There is widespread concern among many OECD countries that the&#13;
present level of budget deficits is unsustainable, and many of them have&#13;
taken steps to correct this. The topic of sustainability of budget&#13;
deficits is analyzed in a number of OECD studies.19/ In general the aim&#13;
in all OECD countries is to bring budget deficits down to historically&#13;
'normal' levels. However, these aims have been more difficult to achieve&#13;
in practice than in principle. The US, for example, has gone from a target&#13;
policy of "budget balance in 1984" to a target deficit of no more than 2%&#13;
of GDP in 1988. Table III.19 and Chart DI show actual government deficits&#13;
since 1971 for 7 OECD countries and the total for OECD as a whole. The&#13;
evolution since the 1970s, over the first and second oil shocks has been&#13;
quite striking. From before 1970, when deficits were on the order of&#13;
negative 0.5% of GDP to 0.5% of GDP, i.e., more or less balanced, the trend&#13;
has changed dramatically. In 1975, the average deficit of the major 7 OECD&#13;
countries was -4.3% of GDP. As OECD point out, after the first oil shock,&#13;
deficits generally increased as governments took the adjustment burden on&#13;
themselves, rather than forcing the adjustment onto the private sector.&#13;
Subsequently, however, the inflationary consequences of this led&#13;
to unacceptable weaknesses in currencies and trade balances, and a&#13;
consequent need to reverse the policies. In the more recent years,&#13;
however, the very slow recovery has led to an increase in public sector&#13;
19/ Chouraqui and Price, op. cit., CPE/WP1/(81)1, and SME/SAIR/SE/83.09.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
deficits to 1983. This is partly the result of the non-accommodative&#13;
monetary policies which have been followed in some larger OECD countries,&#13;
with the consequent growth in the interest burden. Another factor has been&#13;
the interaction of monetary and fiscal policies in prolonging slow&#13;
recovery.&#13;
However, the slow growth has also meant that income and employ-&#13;
ment-related revenues have been reduced while expenditure patterns have&#13;
exhibited rigidities. While almost all OECD governments have adopted&#13;
balanced budget targets for 1984 or 1985, the persistence of the deficits&#13;
in OECD countries has stymied many governments. There is a fear that&#13;
spending and revenue patterns may be structural in nature, and that the&#13;
policy prescription of old can no longer be used. There is question&#13;
whether new prescriptions may be called for, and above all, whether the&#13;
deficits will 'disappear' when the recovery gathers steam.&#13;
Another feature of government deficits in recent years,&#13;
representing a major change from previous trends, is the component of&#13;
deficit which is financing government consumption expenditures. Deficits&#13;
which finance government capital expenditures are nothing new, although&#13;
typically government current savings had also contributed to capital&#13;
formation. Nonetheless, in the 1970's government current savings have not&#13;
contributed greatly to financing the deficit in all major OECD&#13;
countries.20/ On average, the contribution of government current savings&#13;
to the overall financial deficits was 65%. In the 1980s, government&#13;
20/ See CPE/WP1/(81)1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
current savings to the overall financial deficits was 65%. In the 1980s,&#13;
government current dissaving has been the rule, as Table III._  indicates,&#13;
so that in the 1980s, deficits were at least in part, due to higher&#13;
government consumption, with any global expenditure reductions typically&#13;
directed at government capital expenditures, i.e., investment and not&#13;
government consumption.&#13;

The implication of the consumption-based deficits for future&#13;
growth and capital formation are worrisome, because deficits will not then&#13;
be financed out of future growth. As OECD points out, where economic&#13;
growth is less than the real interest rate, deficits will imply borrowing&#13;
to finance interest payments on the public debt.21/&#13;
Table III.20 provides corroborating evidence, showing the&#13;
shrinking proportion of government investment as a share of GDP, relative&#13;
to total government expenditure. From 13.1% of total government&#13;
expenditure in 1970, government investment expenditure fell to 8.1% in&#13;
1982. And in FY82, for the major OECD countries, 40% of the deficit was&#13;
due to current dissavings. If this is a purely cyclical phenomenon, which&#13;
will reverse itself with a return to economic health, the present level of&#13;
actual deficits is of less concern, as it represents counter-cyclical&#13;
macro-economic policy.&#13;
In general, public sector reliance on external financing was&#13;
greater at the end of the decade than at the outset. As the table shows,&#13;
between 1971 and 1981, the proportion of OECD central government debt held&#13;
overseas rose nearly 30% from 11.0% of the total to 13.5%. In the case of&#13;
the United States, the increase is especially striking--between 1/3 and 1/4&#13;
of all government debt is presently held abroad. As a share of OECD GDP,&#13;
the proportion of foreign debt grew from 2.5% almost to 3% of GDP, an&#13;
increase of 20%. In sum, OECD has increasingly drawn on capital inflows&#13;
from the foreign section for financing of government deficits; in many&#13;
countries this has been an important factor in helping to keep domestic&#13;
interest rates down.&#13;

Structural vs Cyclical Deficits&#13;
A recent OECD study22/ has attempted to separate the effects of&#13;
the structural components of these government deficits, from those which&#13;
have been cyclically induced by the recession and economies' slow&#13;
recovery. The questions examined include "to what extent do OECD countries&#13;
face 'structural' problems with respect to deficits"?, and "are the levels&#13;
of structural deficit compatible with governments", other economic object-&#13;
ives, such as price stability, employment output growth?' The study&#13;
attempts to measure the nature and size of structural budget deficits.&#13;
Overall, in brief, their assessment has been that the deterior-&#13;
ation in budget deficits is primarily due to the impact of inflation, slow&#13;
growth and unemployment. These three factors, in the past, would probably&#13;
have been classified as purely cyclical. Recent thinking, however,&#13;
suggests that they have structural components and contribute to structural&#13;
deficits.&#13;
Chart III.5 presents the structural budget deficit for major OECD&#13;
countries, combined.23! The structural deficit is defined as the deficit&#13;
which would result at "potential output", i.e., they are "full-employment"&#13;
deficits. The trends differ by countries. Taken together, however, from&#13;
1970 to 1983, OECD countries deficits, when adjusted for cyclical factor,&#13;

were negative throughout the period, except 1970, ranging from negative&#13;
-.1% of GDP to -2.0% of GDP (1976). In the last few years, since 1980, the&#13;
structural deficit, overall for OECD has been smaller than in the past. In&#13;
1983, the structural deficit is estimated at -0.6% of OECD potential GNP,&#13;
or very near being in balance. Structural surpluses exist in a number of&#13;
countries including UK and France. And throughout the past decade, until&#13;
1983 the U.S. was in structural surplus.&#13;

Disaggregating, revenue and expenditures from 1970-75, structural&#13;
public expenditures increased from 31% of potential output to just under&#13;
35% (see Table III.22). In the second half of the decade, expenditures&#13;
rose again, reaching 36% by 1980. Contributing to this was a steady growth&#13;
in social security payments (column 4) from 9% to 12% of potential GDP, and&#13;
an increase in the interest bill, from 1.9% to 4.8% of potential GNP&#13;
(column 6). On the revenue side, full employment revenues did increase&#13;
throughout the decade, from 31.7% of potential GDP to 35.6% of GDP in&#13;
1983. And at almost every point in the decade, 'full employment'&#13;
expenditures exceeded, sometimes by a substantial margin of as much as 2&#13;
percentage points, 'full employment' revenues. This suggests that the&#13;
contribution of expenditure rigidities is perhaps a factor in determining&#13;
the long run gap between revenues and expenditures.24/&#13;
24/ In the United States, tax reductions have also been responsible.&#13;

Control of Structural deficits&#13;
The need to reduce structural deficits has been given a great&#13;
deal of weight. In general, measures taken by OECD countries to reduce&#13;
structural deficits have been partially successful. At full employment&#13;
since 1981 the size of the structural OECD deficit has, in fact, been quite&#13;
small. Its noted earlier, the 1983 estimate represents the failure of the&#13;
US to contain its deficit, which is now structurally estimated at (-) 0.8%&#13;
as well as that of Japan, with an estimated structural deficit of negative&#13;
(-) 1.8% of potential GDP. In other OECD countries, the estimated&#13;
structural deficit was close to zero (Germany and Canada) or in surplus&#13;
(the United Kingdom and France).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
Despite the reduction in structural deficits as measured, actual&#13;
deficits have continued to grow, reaching in 1983, (-) 4.5% GDP. In this&#13;
measure, a large cyclical component is responsible for the actual&#13;
deficits. In 1983, less than 15% of the actual deficit was due, in the&#13;
estimate of OECD25/, to structural factors. Nonetheless, there is reason&#13;
to fear future growth in these actual deficits, even ignoring, for the&#13;
moment, any impact they may have on financial markets. The actual deficit&#13;
can feed back into the structural deficit in two ways. The first is via&#13;
its impact on higher debt and interest charges. The second is via the&#13;
impact that prolonged recessions and high interest rates may have on&#13;
capital formation and future growth. Thus, it is possible that the actual,&#13;
"cyclical" deficit be converted into a structural one, as potential growth&#13;
is affected by the deflationary policies followed to reduce the actual&#13;
deficits. This results from the alleged effects of the level of actual&#13;
deficits on capital formation and the effects of the structure of revenues&#13;
and expenditure on efficiency of resource allocation.&#13;
This concern that large actual deficits may have structural&#13;
implications arise because concern over the private sector responses,&#13;
includes savings propensities, to these deficits. In the US, the impact of&#13;
the prospect of prolonged high borrowing requirements of the government has&#13;
already been manifested in the level of long term interest rates which&#13;
results from 'expectations'. Large deficits, which rapidly add to the&#13;
stock of government debt, cannot be acommodated in investor portfolio&#13;
preferences and balances, except at substantially higher interest rates.&#13;
The potential crowding out is discussed in Section E and F.&#13;

Summary&#13;
The structural balance figures shown in Table III.22 corroborate&#13;
the discussion of revenue and expenditures elasticities, and suggest that&#13;
the deficit problems cannot be solved simply by increasing taxes. If&#13;
expenditures increase structurally at a rate faster than GNP because of&#13;
entitlement origins and the cumulative impact of debt interest, then&#13;
raising taxes cannot close the deficits. If expenditure growth can be&#13;
maintained at constant levels, (i.e., grow at the same rate as GNP, or&#13;
less) then taxes can do the job. The analysis in section C suggested that&#13;
public expenditures especially on entitlement program subsidies and health&#13;
have been growing rapidly, but that reductions in these expenditures,&#13;
especially pricing changes are feasible. If the changes can be made to&#13;
bring expenditures in line in a structural sense with revenues, future&#13;
structural deficits can be contained, tax increases to match expenditure&#13;
cuts may also be necessary,&#13;

Trends in Savings 27/&#13;
Examination of the savings rate in the 1960-82 period suggests&#13;
that the apparent downward trend in savings ratios since 1975 represents&#13;
the more relevant trend for analysis and projections. While fluctuation in&#13;
savings rates have been procyclical, and a decline in savings ratios is&#13;
expected and normal during periods of recession and an increase during the&#13;
recovery periods, the analysis of the trends would support the notion of a&#13;
structural shift in savings ratios.&#13;
In Table III.23 the savings rate in OECD appears to have&#13;
fluctuated with changes in income over the cycle, but around a declining&#13;
savings trend. The OECD average savings rate dropped from 13.11% of GDP in&#13;
the 1960-74 period to 10.1% of GDP in the 1975-81 period. This is below&#13;
the 12.2% of GDP savings rate for the entire 1961-81 period. There is also&#13;
evidence that the savings rate at the bottom of the recent recession was&#13;
27/ In this section trends in net savings are examined. In discussing&#13;
savings behavior and behavioral determinants, net savings is the&#13;
relevant concept. Net savings is defined as gross savings less capital&#13;
consumption allowances. Gross savings thus include net savings and&#13;
capital consumption. Because capital consumption allowances are not a&#13;
behavioral variable, but determined by legal and tax structures in the&#13;
country concerned, the gross savings concept is less interesting in&#13;
analysizing changes in savings trends. Gross saving across countries&#13;
is relatively constant and shows virtually no trend over time. Capital&#13;
consumption allowances, or depreciation, are relatively more important&#13;
in lower than in high savings countries. During the 1970's, capital&#13;
consumption exceeded net savings by large margins in the U.S., and the&#13;
U.K. In countries with the much faster rates of capital formation,&#13;
capital consumption was smaller than net savings, and also less&#13;
important relative to national disposable income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
lower (8.9% of GDP) than in the previous recession (9.8%), and that at&#13;
cyclical highs, savings were also lower (11.05% of GDP in 1979 as compared&#13;
to 13.2% in 1968). This shift in the trend of savings for the whole of&#13;
OECD requires an examination of the savings rates in the different&#13;
countries and an analysis of the components of savings in each country.28/&#13;
28/ This section examines only the standard national accounts savings data,&#13;
which (see passim) do not take into account country institutional&#13;
differences. Savings rates need to be adjusted, inter-alia, for&#13;
indirect taxes, pensions, consumer durables purchases, etc. There have&#13;
however been attempts at explaining the differences of the savings&#13;
ratio in different OECD countries to take in to account the importance&#13;
of institutional factors which the accounting rules in the SNA do not&#13;
incorporate in detail. Blades (Occasional Studies, OECD, June 1983,&#13;
Alternative Measures of Savings) examines household savings ratios and&#13;
incorporates a variety of changes to the SNA accounting rules. The&#13;
coefficient of variation of individual country savings rates using the&#13;
SNA gross savings ratio is 36%. The coefficient is reduced to 26% when&#13;
corporate net savings are included or incorporating households and all&#13;
enterprises in the sector. The coefficient of variation rises to 50%&#13;
if the adjustment is made to exclude unincorporated enterprises from&#13;
the household sector, and the coefficient of variation is reduced to&#13;
19% when expenditures of consumer durables are included in the savings&#13;
component. The increased stability of the savings ratio, which&#13;
includes consumer durables as capital, results in a marked reduction in&#13;
the difference in savings rates between countries. Nevertheless,&#13;
despite the adjustments, the data on savings still shows a trend&#13;
towards a reduction in national savings ratios since 1975.&#13;

A negative change in the trend, shown in column 3, is reflected&#13;
in (i) a movement from a positive trend to no trend, (ii) a reduction in a&#13;
positive trend value, or (iii) a falling trend which becomes more&#13;
pronounced. During the 1973-1979 period there were no rising trends in&#13;
OECD net savings. Conditions appear to have worsened in the 1980-1983&#13;
period.&#13;
Although the periods here are broken into pre- and post-1973, the&#13;
fall in the savings rate became more acute after 1975. While in some&#13;
countries the saving rate has recovered from the very low 1975 value, in&#13;
the majority, the savings rates have remained low or decreased even&#13;
further.&#13;
Sources of Savings&#13;
The national savings ratio is comprised of the savings rates in&#13;
the three principal subsectors in the economy--households, business and the&#13;
general government. These are weighted--with their weights determined by&#13;
the sectoral shares in national income--to provide the overall total. A&#13;
comprehensive analysis of the savings ratio and the shift in the trend&#13;
requires of an analysis of the sectoral savings ratio and of sectoral&#13;
shares.&#13;
Sectoral savings in OECD can be regarded as the surplus on&#13;
current transactions accounts" available for financing real capital&#13;
formation, lending abroad, or lending to other domestic sectors, where this&#13;
surplus is used to finance investment or current expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The primary sources of funds for investment are private and&#13;
corporate savings, budgetary surpluses arising from govenment accounts, and&#13;
borrowings from the rest of the world. Table III.25 and Chart III.8&#13;
indicate the sectoral shares of savings as a percent of total GDP.29/&#13;

The table suggests that the drop in the net savings of the OECD&#13;
corresponds to increasing dissavings in the government sector which have&#13;
not been compensated by corresponding increases in house-hold or corporate&#13;
savings. Household savings ratios increased in 1974 and 1975, while the&#13;
corporate sector, which showed a deterioration of its financial position&#13;

inventory expenditures.&#13;
After 1975, the household savings ratio in the major OECD&#13;
countries had been declining and corporate sectors' own generation of&#13;
savings has declined, and is substantially below the levels of the&#13;
mid-1960s, or 1970s.&#13;

Government Savings&#13;
During the 1975-1981 period, net government current (dis)savings&#13;
as a percentage of GDP in the seven major OECD countries was negative in&#13;
4 out of 6 years. When government investments are included, government's&#13;
overall dissavings was greater still.30/&#13;
Household Savings&#13;
As Table III.24 indicates, household savings have fallen since&#13;
1975. This is due to a complex interaction of microeconomic as well as&#13;
macroeconomic factors--which ex-ante one may assume to have affected&#13;
savings behavior. These include, for example, inflation, unemployment,&#13;
level of real and nominal interest rates, demographic changes, income&#13;
growth.&#13;
Table III.26 outlines the results of a selection of empirical&#13;
studies of the interest elasticity of the savings rate. In general the&#13;
results suggest that the relationship is positive, though small, i.e.,&#13;
higher interest rates stimulate higher savings. Results however are&#13;
sensitive to the specifications. A related factor is the availability of&#13;
credit which generally appear in the U.S., especially, to be negatively&#13;
related to savings. The results would therefore support the view that&#13;
savings will return to a (higher) structural level, once households adjust&#13;
to, and remain convinced that positive returns can be earned on their&#13;
savings.&#13;

The relationship between savings and inflation has also been&#13;
difficult to quantify. In a period of inflation, savings could be expected&#13;
to decrease since the incentive is to accelerate purchases of goods, and&#13;
switch from money, which is loosing its purchasing value, to commodities.&#13;
Money illusion about inflationary increases in income may also stimulate&#13;
consumption. If during periods of inflation, interest rates do not adjust,&#13;
this is yet another damper on savings incentives. On the other hand, if&#13;
real interest rates are maintained or increased, then the incentive is to&#13;
shift towards financial instruments instead of commodities. Positive&#13;
effects on savings derive from the fact that inflation also generates&#13;
uncertainty. If the expectations of households are that antiinflationary&#13;
policies will be put into effect, households will expect increased&#13;
unemployment and a fall in income growth. This uncertainty will make it&#13;
rational to increase savings. Finally, there may be attempts to&#13;
re-establish levels of real wealth, a "target" savings phenomenon which&#13;
might act to increase savings. This appears to have taken place in&#13;
U.K.31/ The results outlined in the tables which follow are sensitive to&#13;
the period measured. In those studies which include the period to 1980,&#13;
the effect on savings, of inflation is either negative, or inconclusive.&#13;
This suggests that the observed decline in the savings rate in the 1878 to&#13;
the present period is less due to structural factors than to micro-economic&#13;
responses.&#13;

The role of budget deficits in the overall savings picture comes&#13;
into play inter alia via the effects these might have on inflation, and&#13;
inflationary expectations. The latter would arise as the result of fears&#13;
that the deficits would be monetized. The attached table presents the&#13;
results of number of studies using the expected inflation variable. The&#13;
results are not entirely conclusive, but there is evidence that there is a&#13;
negative relationship also between expected inflation and savings.&#13;

A third factor affecting saving is the demographic structure of&#13;
the population. The life cycle hypothesis of savings is based on a number&#13;
of demographic factors. Among them are increases in life expectancy, which&#13;
would cause the household savings ratio of a growing population to rise,&#13;
since each individual requires higher wealth accumulation to finance a&#13;
constant consumption stream over the extended retirement period. The&#13;
retirement age when it is reduced, will increase household savings ratios&#13;
since each individual would require a larger stock of wealth to finance&#13;
consumption. The age distribution of the population will determine ceteris&#13;
paribus, that the savings ratio will depend on the distribution of&#13;
households of certain ages in the total number of households. An increase&#13;
in the ratio of the 18 to 64 working age group as a percent of the total&#13;
population would increase savings, and the shift from old (dissavers) to&#13;
young (savers) will increasing savings. Empirically, OECD has experienced&#13;
an aging of the population, with further aging expected. The table below&#13;
outlines changes in OECD population which might be expected to influence&#13;
savings rates. The table shows a substantial projected increase in the&#13;
proportion of the aged population (dissavers) relative to the working&#13;
population. The aged increase from 3.8% of total industrialized country&#13;
working population in 1979 to 13.1% by the year 2000. This is a structural&#13;
factor of which account must be taken.&#13;

Family size will affect savings as larger family affects the&#13;
overall time profile of consumption and savings (see Leff, 1969). Also&#13;
noted by OECD, in the average age of entry into the job market and the&#13;
period of formal education of young people which will effect the dependency&#13;
period of the young and the aggregate saving ratio. The increases in&#13;
female participation increases the number of households with two earners.&#13;
Whether this demographic change has positive or negative effects on savings&#13;
depends on the access to consumer credit, the need for precautionary&#13;
assets, and the substitution of home produced goods and services by&#13;
commercial output. OECD (1979) indicates a tendency for a lowering of the&#13;
savings ratio as a result of higher female labor force participation.&#13;
One of the most studied factors among savings determinants is the&#13;
impact of pension schemes and social security. The theoretical&#13;
relationship suggests that if life-cycle savings motivations predominate,&#13;
working generations have little motivation to save for retirement, which is&#13;

provided for through pensions. Clearly there is no one for one&#13;
substitution between pensions and private savings, as the characteristics,&#13;
(e.g., liquidity) of each are different, and no such one for one reduction&#13;
should be expected. Moreover, since pensions do not, typically, fully&#13;
replace part income, there is remains some motivation for savings.&#13;
Empirically, the results presented in Table III.29 are mixed. In some&#13;
countries there is evidence of reduced household savings, in others, the&#13;
relationship is difficult to confirm. The reduction of private savings&#13;
translates into lower national savings because public pension schemes are&#13;
typically unfunded.&#13;
To summarize, these determinants suggest mixed effects, and no&#13;
clear picture emerges for future savings.&#13;
Corporate Savings - During the 1964-1981 period, the corporate&#13;
sector has generated a declining share of total net savings. For the&#13;
period, the results for the major 7 countries are presented in Table&#13;
III.30. OECD corporate savings made up, on average 28% of total savings in&#13;
1964, 19.3% in 1970, and 13.6% in 1981.&#13;
The decrease in the share of corporate savings in the total net&#13;
savings is not yet explained, although there are a number of hypotheses.&#13;
One factor may be the (still sparse) evidence on declining trends in&#13;
profitability in the OECD corporate sector. Higher rates of inflation&#13;
during the 1974-1981 period are another possible explanation.32/ Higher&#13;

inflation, through its effects on profit rates, reduces the portion of&#13;
retained earnings used for internal financing. During the 1973-1981 period&#13;
the realized rate of return in the six major countries [U.S., Japan,&#13;
Germany, France, UK and Canada] fell from 20 to 13% while the share of&#13;
gross operating surplus fell from 32 to 28%. These developments have been&#13;
affected by both cyclical and secular factors. The secular decline in&#13;
profitability coincides with the slow down in the growth of productivity in&#13;
most of the OECD nations. Inflation would also have effects on&#13;
profitability since non-indexed tax systems lead to a taxation of real and&#13;
capital and wealth.&#13;

It shows that, in real terms corrected by a common deflator at 1975 prices&#13;
and dollar exchange rates the weakness in OECD output growth is correlated&#13;
with a slowdown in fixed capital formation and in savings, here shown as&#13;
gross savings. The downward trends that were apparent in net savings are&#13;
paralelled in the trend for the variables shown for the period 1974-1981.&#13;
During the 1960-1981 period, the growth rate in capital formation in the&#13;
OECD averaged 4.2 per annum. In the 1960-74 period the average was 6.2%.&#13;
The average rate for the 1974-81 period has been less than 1.% (0.8) for&#13;
fixed capital formation. These outcomes result in part from the large drop&#13;
in investment and savings in 1974 and 1975. Taking gross savings and&#13;
investment together both have grown at parallel rates in real terms over&#13;
the latter period. This makes it difficult to demonstrate that lower&#13;
investment derives from lower savings, suggesting that overall economic&#13;
conditions have been important.&#13;
Table III.33 shows the sectoral composition of capital&#13;
formation. Broadly, the sectoral shares have exhibited stability over the&#13;
period, and there is little evidence of a shift in the share of investment,&#13;
as between corporate, government and households. The corporate share of&#13;
investment has remained stable at 55% of total investment with government&#13;
investment at 11-12% and households at 30-33% of the total. What this&#13;
suggests is that any decline in corporate investment should be attributed&#13;
to overall economic conditions, and not to absorbtion of available shares&#13;
of financing by governments or households.&#13;

Table III.34 outlines the net savings position, or sectoral&#13;
balance, of each sector. It is derived by subtracting from each sector's&#13;
gross savings, the "capital formation" of that sector, to arrive at the&#13;
sector's net savings or dissavings position.&#13;

Net borrowing from outside OECD has averaged about 4.2% of savings and&#13;
about 2% of the gross fixed capital formation. The recent trend since 1974&#13;
reflects a systematic decline in OECD net lending and a reversal from net&#13;
lender to a net borrower position.&#13;

Deficits and Savings&#13;
Taken from an OECD study, Table III.36 examines national savings&#13;
in relation to government absorbtion of savings.33/ The table shows the&#13;
claims of government borrowings on the private savings available, from&#13;
1970-83. Shown are: (i) actual budget deficits as a fraction of gross&#13;
savings; (ii) actual budget deficits as a fraction of net savings; and&#13;
(iii) actual deficits as a fraction of gross savings at full employment&#13;
GDP, i.e., "potential savings." For the seven major OECD countries taken&#13;
together, the government deficit absorbs 51.7% of net savings, and 21.2% of&#13;
gross savings in 1983. This range varies widely among countries, with the&#13;
US deficit absorbing some 60% of private net savings in 1982, and a low of&#13;
20.9% of net savings absorbed by the government sector in Japan. The&#13;
largest fraction is absorbed in Italy, where the government absorbs some&#13;
75% of net savings. The extent of government absorbtion of saving&#13;
represents a striking change from past trends--in 1970, OECD government&#13;
deficits absorbed less than 1% of gross savings. By 1975, this had risen&#13;
to 44.8%, and, by 1983, to 51.7%.&#13;
The chart which follows depicts these trends in government&#13;
deficits and in national saving graphically. There has been a substantial&#13;
narrowing of the gap between the domestic savings available and the&#13;
deficits required to be financed. This gap has, to some extent been filled&#13;
by foreign savings.&#13;

            Deficits, debt, and savings structure of
            OECD countries, with trends from 1965 to 1981
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Much has been made of the possible
            impact of OECD macroeconomic policy on financial flows
            available to developing countries. Specifically, the low
            domestic savings rates in many countries, together with
            governments' own demands for funds in credit markets,
            may have raised the overall cost of funds,
            "crowding-out" developing countries. This paper
            reviews some of the evidence and concludes that the
            crowding-out hypothesis is not likely. While government
            budget deficits and borrowing have indeed been large in
            recent years, revenues and expenditures, when cyclically
            adjusted, come very close to being in balance. At
            non-recessionary levels of income, therefore, expenditure
            and revenue policies are approximately appropriate.
            Moreover, a close examination of expenditure categories and
            taxation policies does not reveal a "structural"
            imbalance, such that future deficits, or growing deficits,
            are inevitable. The causes of the decline in OECD savings
            rates are also examined and are found to lie, to some
            extent, in disincentives which operate at various levels to
            discourage savings, but not to structural, or inexorable
            demographic, causes.
