KENYA DEVOLUTION&#13;
WORKING         PAPER - SUMMARY OVERVIEW                             FEBRUARY 2015&#13;
Kenya has embarked on a highly ambitious decentralization that seeks to fundamentally change the&#13;
relationship between government and citizens under the 2010 Constitution. The Constitution seeks to&#13;
shift government from centralized to decentralized, and from "top-down" to "bottom-up" The Constitution and&#13;
new legal framework place a strong emphasis on strengthening public participation. Strengthening public&#13;
participation and governance is a core element in Kenya's strategy to accelerate growth and address long-standing&#13;
inequalities in economic opportunities, investment, and service delivery in different parts of the country.&#13;
Global experience with decentralization bears out the Constitution's emphasis on governance, transparency&#13;
and participation as it indicates that effective decentralization depends on balancing increased discretion of local&#13;
governments with increased accountability-both upwards and downwards.&#13;
Kenya has a good foundation to strengthen participation in both national and county governments. The&#13;
space for citizen-state interaction continues to expand, the government and civil society have gained significant&#13;
experience deploying participatory tools and approaches, and the media is relatively free.&#13;
As they simultaneously deliver services and build new institutions, counties are seeking to establish effective&#13;
means to engage the public. To respond to this demand, the working papers distill practical findings and lessons&#13;
regarding devolution and participation, based on extensive research conducted over the past 2 years on public&#13;
participation, social accountability, and devolution in Kenya.&#13;
)&gt; The new Constitution and devolution provide a special window of opportunity to embed public participation in&#13;
government systems.&#13;
&gt; hepblchas high expectations for devolution to improve service delivery, governance, and job creation, but limited&#13;
awareness of new roles and responsibilities.&#13;
D Kenyan CSOs, government, and citizens have increasing familiarity with a wide range of public participation and&#13;
social accountability approaches and tools, including good examples of CSOs working hand-in-hand with local&#13;
government and elected officials.&#13;
&gt; These participatory approaches have demonstrated results at the local level, including improving responsiveness,&#13;
project implementation, and addressing governance problems.&#13;
&gt; However, several factors have limited the scale, sustainability, and impact of public participation and social&#13;
accountability initiatives, including:&#13;
o  Participatory processes have primarily been applied to local development funds,especially the CDF and LATF,&#13;
that comprise a small part of the government, and have often focused on project identification rather than&#13;
implementation.&#13;
o  Fragmented rules and systems hinder public participation. Citizens seeking to engage in setting priorities or&#13;
monitoring government programs face a myriad of different, often overlapping service delivery programs.&#13;
o  Local government has had limited capacity and incentive to facilitate participation:&#13;
Citizens face difficulties accessing basic information about local development priorities, policies, budgets,&#13;
expenditures, and project implementation.&#13;
Citizens lack reliable, comparative informationon how their local service providers are performing relative to others.&#13;
Lack of mechanisms to engage disadvantaged and vulnerable populations.&#13;
o Participatory initiatives led by CSOs tend to be small, short-term, and use differing methodologies and platforms, and&#13;
be reliant on donors.&#13;
&gt; The initial months of devolution have brought a new emphasis in government on engaging citizens, but counties&#13;
have faced understandable challenges. Many counties have put in place websites, established basic citizen forums,&#13;
and county communication frameworks, but relatively few have adopted legislation or guidelines on civic education&#13;
or participation, or disseminated updated county budgets and expenditure reports. Key challenges include the cost of&#13;
participation, lack of administrative capacity, and lack of national guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿The working papers suggest practical actions that stakeholders can take to operationalize effective public participation.&#13;
Many of these are related to building government systems and civil servant capacity-for making information public, for&#13;
consulting county stakeholders-that often go beyond traditional public sector roles. Key building blocks include:&#13;
0&#13;
National and county governments can:&#13;
Develop clear guidelines and minimum standards on public participation for national and county government, based&#13;
E&#13;
on the Constitution and new legal framework, with some flexibility to address unique county circumstances;&#13;
Equip counties to disseminate reliable, updated information on county priorities, plans, budgets and expenditures&#13;
through multiple channels;&#13;
&gt; Equip counties to manage structured consultation processes on county laws, plans, and budgets, including outreach&#13;
to vulnerable and marginalized groups. Citizens should be asked to prioritize within a budget envelope, rather than to&#13;
provide open-ended'shopping lists';&#13;
&gt; Establish feedback mechanisms where citizens can register questions or complaint or compliments, without fear of&#13;
reprisal;&#13;
&gt; Dedicate adequate financial and human resources to participatory processes. Training county staff on new&#13;
responsibilities will be crucial, combined with monitoring whether these duties are being implemented;&#13;
&gt; Support participatory project implementation with capacity building and technical expertise;&#13;
&gt; Ensure that citizens understand the new roles, functions, responsibilities of new county assemblies, executives,&#13;
service providers. Developing and widely disseminating a citizen's guide on public participation in devolved government&#13;
0&#13;
may be helpful; and&#13;
&gt;&gt; Develop incentives for counties and wards to improve service delivery performance. Global experience highlights how&#13;
comparative sub-national performance information can spur healthy competition between and within counties. Linking&#13;
financing or other rewards to performance can also provide incentives for counties and wards to improve services.&#13;
Civil society can:&#13;
&gt; Build partnerships with counties to establish participatory processes. Several counties are already reaching out to&#13;
CSOs to help them design and roll out participatory processes;&#13;
&gt; Use networks and coalitions to identify, advocate for, and monitor minimum standards for government transparency,&#13;
accountability, and participation. Donors can help by encouraging multi-year proposals from CSO coalitions to support&#13;
and monitor county participatory processes; and&#13;
&gt;&gt; Use common methodologies and platforms to monitor county performance.&#13;
Development partners can:&#13;
o          &gt; Fund Government-CSO partnerships focused on designing and rolling out participatory county systems and capacity,&#13;
mechanisms for transparency;&#13;
&gt; Support longer-term initiatives by CSO networks and coalitions to advocate for minimum standards for transparency,&#13;
accountability and performance, and to monitor county performance on service delivery, and use shared platforms for&#13;
monitoring results; and&#13;
&gt;&gt; Enhance grant-making criteria that reinforces accountability of CSOs to constituents.&#13;
