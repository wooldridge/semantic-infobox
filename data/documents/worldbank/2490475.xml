                                     A. BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 CONFLICT, RECENT       PROGRESS, AND THE CHALLENGE OF REUNIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
 1.      The Democratic Republic o f the Congo (DRC) is gradually emerging from a&#13;
 decade o fpolitical instability and conflict. War and civil disturbance, compounded by&#13;
 the sequels o f a longperiod o f mismanagement and corruption, have taken a heavy toll on&#13;
 DRC and its 55 million people. The conflict, inwhich seven foreign countries have been&#13;
 involved at some point, has been the world's most murderous indecades. Physical&#13;
 damage i s extensive, institutions are in shambles, and the economy has literally&#13;
 collapsed. Per capita income has declined steadily from about U S 3 8 0 in 1985 to&#13;
 US$250 in 1990 and to US$85 in2000. DRC i s now one o f the poorest countries inthe&#13;
 world, and social indicators are among the worst inAfrica.&#13;
&#13;
 2.      Against this background, progress towards peace and reconciliation has&#13;
 accelerated inthe last period, within the context o fthe 1999 Lusaka Agreement. A UN&#13;
 peace-keeping force, the Mission d 'Observation des Nations Unies au Congo (MONUC)&#13;
 was deployed throughout the country in2002. The withdrawal o f foreign troops was&#13;
 completed by end 2002, following agreements between the DRC Government and the&#13;
 Governments of Rwanda (inJuly 2002) and Uganda (in September2002) respectively.&#13;
 Political negotiations betweenthe Government, armed groups, political opposition, and&#13;
 civil society culminated inan agreement on a power-sharing arrangement for a transition&#13;
 period leadingto elections within 24 to 30 months and inthe appointment on June 30,&#13;
 2003 o f an all-inclusive Government o f national unity with representation o f all key&#13;
 armed groups, unarmedopposition and civil society. The mediation o f the United&#13;
 Nations, and the support o f key bilateral partners, such as South Africa, were critical in&#13;
 this process. The new Government is now functioning (with leaders of the two main&#13;
 armed groups serving as Vice Presidents), which puts an end to the political division o f&#13;
 the country and creates a sound environment for economic and social reunification.&#13;
&#13;
 3.      On the economic front, the Government i s satisfactorily implementingan&#13;
 economic program supported by the World Bank through an Economic Recovery Credit&#13;
 (ERC) and by the International Monetary Fund(IMF) through a Poverty Reduction and&#13;
 Growth Facility (PRGF). In-depthstructural reforms have beenlaunched inthe areas o f&#13;
 economic governance, public expenditure management, poverty reduction, transparency,&#13;
 financial sector and public enterprises reform, local and foreign investment, and the&#13;
 miningand forestry sectors among others. Most importantly, economic growth returned&#13;
 (3 percent in2002) and is expected to accelerate inthe years to come.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'4.      Suchprogress has consolidated the window o fopportunity for peace and recovery&#13;
 inDRC -aprocess which would positively affect the entire Central African sub-region.&#13;
 Ithas also increased the urgency o f effectively reunifyingthe country, which has been&#13;
 split inseveral parts duringthe conflict: after 1998,about halfo f the country (eastern and&#13;
 northern provinces) was administered by a variety o f armed groups (some o f them&#13;
 supported by foreign allies). The political reunification will be a consequence o f the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               - 6 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ongoing political reconciliation process. Butthis effort will not be sustainable unless it i s&#13;
accompanied by a process o f economic and social reunification - Le. the reintegrationo f&#13;
all provinces into a single and common economic space, under a common and inclusive&#13;
authority.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Experience inother countries suggests that such process may take time -but it i s&#13;
seen by most observers as a critical condition for peace to hold both within the country&#13;
and withinthe sub-region, for the economy to continue to recover and grow again, and&#13;
for the current social crisis to be addressed. Although it will have to be carried through to&#13;
a successful conclusion by the Congolese themselves - Government, leaders o f armed '&#13;
groups, figures o f the non-armed opposition, civil society activists, and the people&#13;
themselves - ,external support, particularly financial support, will be critical for success.&#13;

             AND&#13;
&#13;
Overall&#13;
&#13;
6.      The division o fthe country has had devastating effects on the entire country's&#13;
economy and on living standards throughout DRC. Reunification i s hence expected to&#13;
have a positive economic impact not only inreunifiedprovinces, but throughout the&#13;
country -by enlarging the Congolese economic space, recreating markets for local&#13;
products, and providing opportunities for reduced military expenditure.&#13;
&#13;
7.      The situation in reunified provinces presents, however, a number o f specific&#13;
features. Although these regions are characterized by a large degree o f diversity, they&#13;
share a common history o f violence, isolation from the rest o f the country, and&#13;
degradation o f living conditions - which has translated into an exacerbation o f the issues&#13;
which are plaguing the entire country:&#13;
&#13;
    0  A terrifiing humanitarian crisis. Out o f a pre-warpopulation estimated at about&#13;
        20 million inthe eastern and northern regions, about 3 millionare believed to&#13;
        have died as a result o f the conflict. More than 2.4 millionpeople are internally&#13;
        displaced and live inextreme poverty, even by Congolese standards. While social&#13;
        indicators for the DRC as a whole are among the lowest inAfrica, social&#13;
        indicators inmost reunifiedprovinces are evenworse as a result o f population&#13;
       displacements, economic disruptions, and continued insecurity. Humanrights&#13;
       abuses have beenwidespread, and human sufferinghas reached horrendous levels&#13;
       -whichhasdevastatingconsequencesonsocialcapital.&#13;
&#13;
    0  A collapse of the economy. Widespread insecurity, disruptions o f trade and&#13;
       resulting shortages have forced many communities into autarky while prices were&#13;
       skyrocketing inurbancenters and food deficit areas. The widespread looting o f&#13;
       public and individual assets, and the absence o f effective economic management&#13;
       system have discouraged economic production, while laying the ground for a&#13;
       mushrooming o f semi-criminal networks. Access to health care and education has&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                         - 7 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  been substantially reduced, creating the conditions for a long-term&#13;
   impoverishment, spread o f disease, and eventhe perpetuationo f conflict for a&#13;
  younger, unschooled generation. The fiscal system is still inplace, but public&#13;
  resources are mainly concentrated on military spending, with very little, if any,&#13;
  room for poverty alleviation spending. Inmany areas, the challenge is therefore&#13;
  not only to restart an idle engine and spur recovery, but also to turn around the&#13;
  systems and incentives that have emergedover the last years andto put inplace&#13;
  the conditions for a healthy recovery.&#13;
&#13;
  Heavy damage on infrastructure. While direct destructions have beenlocalized&#13;
  and are very variable across the country, infrastructure (both large-sale networks&#13;
  and local assets) has suffered considerable damage from both looting and lack o f&#13;
  maintenance. This has translated into an interruption o f traffic between, and&#13;
  withinkeyprovinces (withthe associated consequences on economic life and&#13;
  living standards), as well as a substantial degradation o f social services delivery&#13;
  (e.g, hospital rooms lacking walls).&#13;
&#13;
  A deep institutional crisis. Reunifiedprovinces have been characterized by a&#13;
  large degree o f fragmentation, resultingfrom political feuds as well as from&#13;
  communications constraints. In some areas, de facto authorities seem to enjoy&#13;
  only a limited amount o f popular support and recognition, while inother places&#13;
  criminal networks and armed bands allegedly dominate. Many local institutions&#13;
  (often former branch offices o f national entities) have lost part o f their staff,&#13;
  facility, and equipment. Technical capacity i s scarce, most civil service salaries&#13;
  have not beenpaid for the last four years, and corruption i s allegedly widespread.&#13;
  Restoring public authority and an effective capacity to deliver minimal social&#13;
  services i s critical for tackling the humanitarian crisis, for spurring economic&#13;
  recovery, and for implementing large-scale rehabilitation activities.&#13;
&#13;
  A rapidly-spreading HIVAIDS epidemic. While detailed statistical data are not&#13;
  available, local surveys which have been conducted over the last years suggest&#13;
  that the epidemic could be a major public health disaster inthe making. Partial&#13;
  information indicates that about 46 percent o f women inpre-natal consultations in&#13;
  Kisangani were tested HIV positive in2001. Prevalence rates o f 20 to 25 percent&#13;
  are commonly mentioned for the Equateur province. The situation inEastern&#13;
  Congo, a region where military from highprevalence countries have fought for&#13;
  several years, and where many people have beendisplaced since 1998 i s believed&#13;
  to be dramatic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0And still the `ffogof war ". Planning for economic recovery is difficult due to&#13;
  uncertainties still surrounding the situation ina number o f reunified area.&#13;
  Detailed and systematic data are often missing- on the status o f critical&#13;
  infrastructure or on the conditions inwhich social services are delivered infar-&#13;
  away provinces - andthe political and security situation remains fluid inmany&#13;
  areas.&#13;

&#13;
The specific situationin each reunifiedprovince&#13;
&#13;
8.      Inadditionto common issues, each reunifiedprovince faces a number o fspecific&#13;
challenges: these areas stretch over about a million square kilometers and a number o f&#13;
ethnic groups; they have gone through differenttypes o f ordeals over the last years and&#13;
are ruledby leaderships o f very different natures. As a result, needs, institutional&#13;
structures, and security conditions vary greatly.&#13;
&#13;
9.      These issues are often not different innature from those faced inareas which have&#13;
beenunder Government control over the last years, but they have been exacerbated by'&#13;
the experience o f extreme violence and the dislocation ofeconomic and administrative&#13;
structures. While a description o f regional specificities inDRC could expose similar&#13;
issues throughout her country, the summary below focuses on the recent history o f those&#13;
reunifiedprovinces, as these are the mainfocus o fthe proposed Project.&#13;
&#13;
10.     The Mouvement de Libe'ration du Congo (MLC) controlled large parts o f northern&#13;
DRC (about half o f the Equateurprovince, and a smaller part o f the Province Orientale).&#13;
This movement, which was originally backed by Uganda, administered a largely forested&#13;
and mostly rural region (with several middle-size cities and markettowns). This region,&#13;
which i s slightly larger than France or Texas, i s home to about 4 to 6 million people.&#13;
&#13;
    0   Political situation. The M L C is a relatively unified and well-organized&#13;
        movement composed o f a coalition o f political opponents to Laurent-DCsirC&#13;
        Kabila and personalities allegedly linked to Mobutu-time business circles. It is&#13;
        led by a reportedly popular businessman, Jean-Pierre Bemba, who i s currently&#13;
        Vice President o f DRC and Head o f the Economic and Financial Commission.&#13;
&#13;
    0   Security situation. The M L C hada relatively well-structured military (with about&#13;
        6,500 to 9,000 troops), which was originally backed up by a Ugandan contingent&#13;
        (and was involved in Central African Republic several times over the last year).&#13;
        The security situation throughout these territories is good, and there are no major&#13;
        security-related concerns for economic recovery.&#13;
&#13;
   0    Economic situation. Prior to the war, small-scale agriculture as well as wood and&#13;
        coffee exports were the mainactivities inthe areas which were controlled by&#13;
        M L C (which include the hometown o f former President Mobutu Sese Seko). The&#13;
        disruption o f transport, inparticular along the Congo River, has had a devastating&#13;
        impact and the population has returnedto subsistence agriculture. The CFA&#13;
        Franc (the currency o f neighboring Central African Republic) i s widely accepted&#13;
        along with the Congolese Franc.&#13;
&#13;
   0    Key issuesfor recovery. Areas which were controlled by M L C consist mostly of&#13;
        historically poor rural communities. They are particularly affected by their&#13;
        isolation, which has resulted inboththe collapse o f institutions and an absence of&#13;
        markets for locally-produced goods.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             - 9 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.    The Rassemblement Congolaispour la De'mocratie-Goma (RCD-Goma)&#13;
controlled most o f eastern DRC (North and South Kivus, northern Katanga, part o f&#13;
Maniema, part o f Eastem Kasai, and part o f the Province Orientale, including Kisangani).&#13;
This movement, which was originally backedby Rwanda, administered a largely&#13;
agricultural and miningregion, which includes DRC's third-largest city, Kisangani, and&#13;
several other large urban centers. This region, which i s slightly larger than the UK and&#13;
Germany put together, i s home to about 10 to 14 millionpeople.&#13;
&#13;
       Political situation. The RCD-Goma has beendescribed as a relatively loose&#13;
       coalition and has beenplaguedwith successive splits. The movement i s currently&#13;
       led by Azarias Rubenva (its sixthpresidentsince 1998), ,who i s currently Vice&#13;
       President o f DRC and Head o f the Political Commission..&#13;
&#13;
       Security situation. Security conditions vary across the area. The situation is&#13;
       stable inmost cities and inmany rural areas, where economic recovery programs&#13;
       can be implemented. But there are large stretches o f territory (notably inthe&#13;
       Kivus) where the about 20,000 RCD-Gomatroops had reportedly largely lost&#13;
       control. Inthese areas, a predatory systemo f violence, which i s linkedto the&#13;
       absence o f economic opportunities, has gradually taken root, inparallel with the&#13;
       resurgence o f ethnic politics and the revival o f traditional rural militias (Mayi-&#13;
       Mayi). Foreign rebels, inparticular from Rwanda and Burundi, have reportedly&#13;
       beenoperating from and within this region. Security conditions have hence to be&#13;
       assessedon a local basis.&#13;
&#13;
       Economic situation. Prior to the conflict, people inthe areas which were&#13;
       administered by RCD-Goma were living from agriculture, including export&#13;
       agriculture, and selected mining activities. After years o f conflict, most o f the&#13;
       population relies on subsistence agriculture, informal activities and limited&#13;
       humanitarian assistance to survive. Many communities are largely excluded from&#13;
       the cash economy and have tumedto barter, while the monetized economy is&#13;
       largely dollarized. More than three quarters o f families living inrural areas have&#13;
       beenforced to move at least once inthe last five years, with the predictable&#13;
       consequences o f food insecurity, malnutrition, and highmortality rates for both&#13;
       the displaced and host populations.&#13;
&#13;
       Key issuesfor recovery. Provinces formerly administeredby RCD-Goma have&#13;
       substantial agricultural and miningpotential - a potential which could not be&#13;
       realized over the last years due to the conflict. Restoring a sound governance&#13;
       system, addressing the issues o f illegal exploitation o f natural resources, and&#13;
       providing a framework for private sector activities, could go a long way to&#13;
       generating economic growth. This will needto be rapidly accompanied with a&#13;
       rehabilitation o f key transport infrastructure. Efforts will have to focus initially&#13;
       on areas which are already stable, and to be gradually enlarged as stability i s&#13;
       restored-keepingin sight that recovery may be key to creating the type o f&#13;
       economic opportunities which will help stabilize the situation and restore full&#13;
       security.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12.     Several other armed groups compete for the control o f the north east (most o f the&#13;
Province Orientale and parts o fNorth Kivu). This i s a largely forested region (with some&#13;
miningresources), but it is fragmented inrelatively small territorial units, each controlled&#13;
by a specific faction. Overall a relatively large degree of chaos seems to prevail inmost&#13;
o f these areas, which are larger than Italy and are home to about 3 to 4 millionpeople.&#13;
&#13;
        Political situation. These areas were controlled by several break-away factions,&#13;
        resulting from the continued fragmentation o f the RCD-Goma, (including: the&#13;
        RCD-Mouvement de Liberation (RCD-ML)-Kisangani, the RCD-ML-Bunia, the&#13;
        RCD-ML-Beni-Butembo, the RCD-National, and the RCD-Congo) as well as&#13;
        locally based movements (like the Union du Peuple Congolais, UPC). Inthe&#13;
        recent period, these groups engaged with one another through shifting alliances&#13;
        and sporadic confrontations, and some have nowjoined the Government.&#13;
&#13;
        Security situation. The deterioration of the security situation innorth-eastem&#13;
        DRC and the accompanying human rights abuses have been a source o f concem&#13;
        for the UNSecurity Council for several months, and the EuropeanUnionhas sent&#13;
        troops to restore order inthe city o f Bunia, where large massacres took place over&#13;
        the last months. Fragmentation ofthe region, absence o fclear leadership,&#13;
        internecine fighting betweenarmed groups, and recurrent ethnic clashes (in&#13;
        particular betweenthe Hema and Lendu clans) have resultedinexplosions o f&#13;
        extreme violence. To date, the situation i s characterized by a highdegree o f&#13;
        political confusion and volatility, which will de facto preventthe implementation&#13;
        o f economic recovery programs inthe short-term.&#13;
&#13;
     0  Economic situation. Prior to the conflict, the population o f north-eastem DRC&#13;
        was living on forestry and agriculture activities, with additional revenues from&#13;
        gold mining. The disruption o f communications and the widespread insecurity&#13;
        have resultedin a collapse o f institutions and a quasi-interruption o f economic&#13;
        activities, forcing communities back to autarky - and the development o f&#13;
        smuggling under semi-criminal networks. Infrastructure damage may be&#13;
        relatively limited due to the pre-war under-equipment o f the region. Many&#13;
        communities are excluded from the cash economy and have tumed to barter.&#13;
&#13;
     0  Key issuesfor recovery. Innorth-eastem DRC, the short-term challenges will&#13;
        center around restoring security and addressing the urgent social and humanitarian&#13;
        crisis. Short o f major improvements o f the security situation, economic prospects&#13;
        will remainbleak.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GOVERNMENT'S       RESPONSE&#13;
&#13;
13.     The Government has expressed its commitment to a successful process o f&#13;
economic and social reunification, as a key condition for the overall success o f the&#13;
economic recovery and political reconciliation process. Inparallel to the complex&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             - 11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
political process which i s underway, the Government has indicated its intention to move&#13;
along a three-track agenda:&#13;
&#13;
        Keep the economic reform program on track, with a particular attentionto&#13;
        absorbing the shocks expected from the process o f economic and social&#13;
        reunification - inparticular the monetary shock (the exchange rates for the&#13;
        Congolese franc vary from one area to the next) and the fiscal shock (with&#13;
        additional spending unmatched inthe short-term by equivalent new resources). A&#13;
        particular effort will be needed to ensure that reforms adopted over the last two&#13;
        years are effectively implementedthroughout the country (to date they have been&#13;
        limited to Government-held areas with no significant parallel effort inreunified&#13;
        provinces), inparticular as regards transparency inthe use o f public resources and&#13;
        for the exploitation o f natural resources.&#13;
&#13;
        Restore institutional unity while allowingfor the necessary decentralization. The&#13;
        Government has placed a strong emphasis on the need to reunify institutions&#13;
        which were divided duringthe conflict - and i s aware that this process will have&#13;
        to go hand-in-hand with a decentralizationprocess aimed at devolving&#13;
        responsibilities to the local level. This will allow to build on some o f the positive&#13;
        aspects o f the last years' experience (inparticular with regard to the&#13;
        responsibilizationo f local-level management teams) and to avoid repeating the&#13;
        mistakes o f the past. The Government has formed technical teams insome key&#13;
        sectors to discuss the practical modalities o f the institutional reunification /&#13;
        decentralization process, as well as to select sectoral priorities for recovery and&#13;
        rehabilitation.&#13;
&#13;
        Provide rapidfinancial support in the eastern and northern parts of the country,&#13;
        with a view to generating peace dividends and stabilizing the social situation,&#13;
        while laying the ground for growth recovery. The Government is considering to&#13;
        use parts o f its own resources to that effect, inparticular through the payment o f&#13;
        salaries for key civil servants, and has also asked donors to support this effort by&#13;
        expanding their programs to the reunifiedprovinces. Inorder to focus scarce&#13;
        resources on priority issues and areas, the Government i s committed to increase&#13;
        the scope and expand to the entire country the coverage o f the US$l.7 billion&#13;
        Emergency Multi-sector Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program (EMRRP)-&#13;
        which was preparedwith Bank assistance and constitutes the Government's&#13;
        emergency minimumand priority investment program and the framework for&#13;
        donor coordination.&#13;
&#13;
14.     This strategic agenda benefits from a large degree o f support beyond Government&#13;
circles and has beenendorsed by all key relevant stakeholders. Indeed, participants inthe&#13;
inter-Congolese dialogue unanimously adopted inApril 2002 resolutions supporting the&#13;
Government-implementedeconomic program and key reforms. Since then, all key&#13;
political stakeholders have reiterated their commitment to this process.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
15.      Inaddition, duringa Bank missionto Kisangani, Goma, andGbadolite, inJanuary&#13;
2003, and through recent contacts with the Country Office inKinshasa, the leaderships of&#13;
the two main groups, the RCD-Goma and the MLC, which are now represented inthe&#13;
Government, both reiteratedtheir commitment to facilitating a continued implementation&#13;
o f the economic program supported by the Bretton Woods Institutions and indicatedtheir&#13;
support to the three-fold agenda described above. They also underlinedthe need for&#13;
rapid economic support inthe provinces they usedto control to help prevent a&#13;
deterioration o f the social and security situation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
INTERNATIONAL      COMMUNITY'SRESPONSE&#13;
&#13;
16.     The possible response o f the international community to the emergingchallenges&#13;
associated with the process o f economic and social reunification was discussed on&#13;
December 4-5,2002, inParis, inthe context o f a Consultative Group meeting. Donors&#13;
engaged ina dialogue on the basis of a discussion note prepared by the Bank, to review&#13;
ongoing activities and discuss a shared strategy for the coming period.&#13;
&#13;
17.     These discussions were based on the experience many bilateral donors and UN&#13;
agencies have acquired over the last years. Indeed, throughout the conflict, a number o f&#13;
donors have remained active inreunifiedprovinces through humanitarian programs -to&#13;
provide health and nutrition services, safe drinking water supplies, support for agriculture&#13;
and other urgent programs, and help strengthencapacity inpublic administration. These&#13;
programs, however, remained limited in scope and focused on emergency humanitarian&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
18.     During the Consultative Group meeting, a consensus emerged around the need to&#13;
provide support to facilitate the process o f economic and social reunification o f DRC.&#13;
Donors emphasized that such support should be provided within the context o f nation-&#13;
wide programs (although with specific activities innorthern and eastern provinces), with&#13;
a particular attention to staying away from activities which could indirectly contribute to&#13;
dividing the country. They also called for a close articulation of economic support with&#13;
the other aspects o f the reunification process, and inparticular humanitarian assistance.&#13;
They finally underlined that external assistance should be provided early on, wherever&#13;
security conditions are adequate.&#13;
&#13;
19.     Inthis context, donors adopted apriority, four-fold agenda to support the&#13;
Congolese strategy towards economic and social reunification:&#13;
&#13;
        Help restore sound economicgovernance -and inparticular help ensure that&#13;
        reforms already undertaken on the Government side are implementedthroughout&#13;
        the country (inparticular as regards issues o ftransparency, public expenditure&#13;
        management, private sector activities, and the exploitation o f natural resources).&#13;
        This should be accompanied by an effort to restore country-wide institutions-&#13;
        which will require tackling the twin challenges o f reunification and&#13;
        decentralization, as well as enhancing capacity in some branch offices (ineastern&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                     - 1 3 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and northern provinces) within the context of such reunification. The external&#13;
provision o f technical assistance and support to capacity enhancement will be&#13;
critical to that effect.&#13;
&#13;
Mitigate thefiscal cost of reunification. The cost o f reunification, inparticular in&#13;
the short-term, is expected to behigh. Significant resource transfers to reunified&#13;
provinces will be needed, inparticular to restart paying civil servants' wages, and&#13;
to contribute to alleviating the humanitarian crisis. As the country moves towards&#13;
re-unification, expendituresare expected to rise rapidly from 6.6 percent o f GDP&#13;
in2001 to 11percent in2002 and 18.1 percent in2003 (evenwith average&#13;
salaries inthe public sector at about US$15 a month). Still, the restoring o f a fair&#13;
and effective revenue collection system will take time. There is therefore likely&#13;
going to be a significant gap at least duringa transition period, which will have to&#13;
be filled by the Government, through a combination of fiscal revenues (collected&#13;
inthe areas currently underits control) and external assistance.&#13;
&#13;
Support rehabilitation of essential infrastructure and the restoring of social&#13;
services in eastern and northern areas. Rapidprogress will be needed to deliver&#13;
"peace dividends'' and consolidate a fragile social situation, with a particular&#13;
focus on removing key obstacles to growth and providing opportunities in&#13;
impoverished communities (e.g., through the use o f labor-intensive schemes). In&#13;
parallel, efforts will be neededto prepare for the extension o f the E M W to the&#13;
entire territory, to put inplace an effective framework to overcome the lack o f&#13;
implementation capacity, and ensure adequate coordination to minimize gaps,&#13;
avoid overburdening a limited administrative capacity, and create synergies and&#13;
leverage.&#13;
&#13;
Assist in demobilization and reintegrationformer combatants. Within the context&#13;
o f the Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRP), special&#13;
efforts will be neededto successfully demobilize, disarm, and socially reintegrate&#13;
foreign combatants currently present inthe DRC. Inparallel, action will be&#13;
neededto provide young Congolese currently involved inarmed groups with&#13;
options for their social reintegration. This should be integrated in a broader effort&#13;
for community recovery, with due attention paid to mitigating moral hazard issues&#13;
which may arise from the singling out o f former combatants.&#13;

to help design and implement economic reforms. Financial support was first approved,in&#13;
July 2001, with Board approval o f a US$50 million Emergency Early Recovery Project&#13;
(EERP), funded through an IDA grant. Subsequently,following the clearance o fDRC&#13;
arrears inJune 2002, the Board approved a US$450 million ERC inJune 2002, a US$454&#13;
million Emergency Multi-sector Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (EMRR&#13;
Project) inAugust 2002, and a US$120 Private Sector Development and Competitiveness&#13;
Project (PSDCP) inJuly 2003. The Bank i s also managing a multi-donor Trust Fund&#13;
which finances the Emergency Stabilization and Recovery Project (ESRP), with&#13;
contributions from the Governments o f Belgium and Canada as well as from the&#13;
European Commission. The Bank i s currently working on the preparation o f additional&#13;
activities, both lendingproducts and non-lending services, including a large HIV/AIDS&#13;
operation.&#13;
&#13;
21.      For the full benefits o f the recovery effort supported by these projects to&#13;
materialize, however, the success o f the process o f economic and social reunification i s&#13;
key. There i s a widespread consensus that failure inthis process would result ina&#13;
continued humanitarian crisis and further insecurity, which may eventually result in&#13;
renewedwar: chaos and poverty inborder regions would make it possible for foreign&#13;
armed groups to operate again from DRC, which inturn could trigger a new round o f&#13;
foreign interventions, and generalized conflict. Success inthe economic arena will be&#13;
critical to prevent such a scenario to happen-through the successful economic and social&#13;
stabilization o f key areas, the rapid generation of "peace dividends" even if initially only&#13;
on a relatively small scale, the return o f economic growth, the re-connection o f the&#13;
different parts o f the country, andthe restoration o f basic public and social services.&#13;
&#13;
22.     Duringthe December 2002 Consultative Groupmeeting, donors called on the&#13;
Bank to take the lead inpreparingfor an extension o f the priority programo f investment&#13;
for rehabilitation and reconstruction (the EMRRP), for this program to eventually cover&#13;
the entire country. They also encouraged the Bank to rapidly commit resources which&#13;
could contribute to stabilizing the economic and social situation inthe eastern and&#13;
northern provinces. Such an intervention could inparticular help the Bank catalyze&#13;
donor resources, as demonstrated inthe earlier IDA projects, as well as in other post-&#13;
conflict countries.&#13;
&#13;
23.     The Government echoed these calls both duringthe Consultative Group meeting&#13;
and during further discussion inthe context of its ongoing dialogue with the Bank. The&#13;
Government inparticular requested the Bank to consider providing rapidassistance inthe&#13;
reunifiedprovinces, with a view to helprestore sound economic governance inthese&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             - 15-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
areas, and to support rehabilitation activities. The Government expressed its concern&#13;
that, short o f substantial and rapid external assistance, the situation inreunifiedprovinces&#13;
may severely deteriorate.&#13;
&#13;
24.     The proposedProject was not explicitly mentioned inthe TSS, as political&#13;
progress has been faster than expected. Still, it i s an essential complement to activities&#13;
currently underway to achieve the objectives set inthe TSS, and it enjoys a large degree&#13;
o f support among key donors as well as with all the factions represented inthe recently-&#13;
appointed Government o f national unity. Inview o f the emergency, the decision was&#13;
made to carry out technical work as appropriate for a launch o f the activities supported&#13;
underthe Project as early as possible, inadvance o fa new TSS which is currently&#13;
plannedfor late fall 2003 (and o f which the Project will be part).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
25.     Over the last months, the Bank has developed an intervention strategy, which was&#13;
welcomed by boththe Government and other donors duringthe Consultative Group&#13;
meetingheld inDecember 2002 inParis. Parallel actions are planned insupport o f a&#13;
four-track agenda:&#13;
&#13;
        Continue to support economic reform and rehabilitation throughout the country.&#13;
       The Bank intends to provide continued support to the implementationo fthe&#13;
       economic program, which will requireinterventions at the central level, in&#13;
       Government-controlled territories, as well as inreunified provinces. The Bank i s&#13;
       inparticular committed to providing capacity enhancement support to helpthe&#13;
       Governmentaddress key issues arising from re-unification (e.g., to restore an&#13;
       effective fiscal system, to track additional expenditure, or to re-unify technical&#13;
       institutions).&#13;
&#13;
       Provide earlyfinancial support in the northern and easternprovinces, in&#13;
       particularfor quick impact activities. Inareas where the political and security&#13;
       situations are adequate, the Bank can play a critical role inproviding early&#13;
       financial support, with a focus on: (i)generating early "peace dividends" through&#13;
       small-scale rehabilitation, social services, and employment generation projects;&#13;
       (ii)developingeffectiveandtransparentimplementationchannelswhichcouldbe&#13;
       later usedfor larger-scale operations; and (iii)   providing limited balance o f&#13;
       payments support for the Government to face emergency additional expenditures&#13;
       consistent with its Medium-Term Expenditure Framework.&#13;
&#13;
       Preparefor large-scale support. To ensure proper targetingand coordination o f&#13;
       donor-funded recovery activities, it will be necessary to expand the coverage o f&#13;
       the EMRRP, as a common framework for assistance -a strategy for recovery,&#13;
       with a clear identification o f specific investment priorities and o f options for&#13;
       implementation. The Bank i s committed to assist the Government inthis effort.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                    - 16-&#13;
&#13;
Facilitate strong donor coordination. Inview o f the scarcity of financial&#13;
resources likely to be available inthe short-term and of the magnitude o fthe task&#13;
ahead, donor coordination takes a particular importance. To that effect, the Bank&#13;
has established a working-level, virtual coordination group, where donors can&#13;
share technical and other data, inform each other on their plans and ongoing&#13;
activities, organize joint missions as may be relevant and necessary, and discuss&#13;
informally options for the way ahead. This i s a very flexible mechanism which&#13;
complement coordination activities on the ground, inKinshasa and other&#13;
locations.&#13;

&#13;
PROJECTOBJECTIVES&#13;
&#13;
26.    The Project aims to assist the Government inthe process o f economic and social&#13;
reunification. Such support is critical to help mitigate the ongoing social and&#13;
humanitarian crisis andto facilitate the continued implementation of the economic reform&#13;
program - and hence to contribute to the stabilization o f DRC.&#13;
&#13;
27.    Inthe context o fthe Government's responseto the reunificationchallenge, ofthe&#13;
existing consensus among donors, and o f the overall Bank strategy inDRC, the Project's&#13;
specific objectives are three-fold:&#13;
&#13;
       Help restore or introduce a sound economic governance system throughout the&#13;
       country,by providing the type o f expertise and financial resources neededto&#13;
       ensure a satisfactory reunification of key institutions and the implementation of&#13;
       key economic reforms throughout the country;&#13;
&#13;
   0   Complement actions currently underway to address urgent needs, alleviate the&#13;
       sufferingo f Congolese people, and generate quick "peace dividends" which could&#13;
       contribute to the stabilization o f the country, by financing rehabilitation activities&#13;
       inthoseparts o fthe country where no major economic assistance program is&#13;
       under implementation yet; and&#13;
&#13;
       Preparefor the rapid extension of the EMRRP to all parts of the country, in&#13;
       particular by activating implementation mechanisms designed to overcome&#13;
       existing capacity constraints and deliver results with efficiency and transparency&#13;
       inreunifiedprovinces.&#13;
&#13;

component are described inAppendix F.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OVERALL    DESIGN&#13;
&#13;
29.    The Project will include five components:&#13;
&#13;
       Two components directly aimed at supporting implementation of economic&#13;
       reforms throughout the country -a balance o f payments support component and&#13;
       an institutional strengtheningcomponent; these components are expected to be&#13;
       complementary to each other, and to be implemented inclose coordination with&#13;
       other activities aimed at supporting the country-wide economic reform process.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         .&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
        Three components aimed at both addressing urgent needs and activating&#13;
        implementation mechanisms inreunified provinces- as a first step to prepare for&#13;
        the eventual extension o f the EMRRP;these components will aim to meet a large&#13;
        variety o f needs and will inparticular distinguishbetween three different types o f&#13;
        activities: (i)&#13;
                      rehabilitation o f large infrastructure, inparticular transport&#13;
        infrastructure; (ii)&#13;
                           rehabilitation inurban areas; and (iii)  provision o f assistanceto&#13;
        isolated rural communities, where no service provider has been active inyears or&#13;
        decades.&#13;
&#13;
30.     Interventions will be limited to areas o f DRC where activities can be implemented&#13;
without undue security risk to Bank staff and personnel employed under contracts&#13;
financed by the Project. Incase o f doubt, information and guidance will be sought from&#13;
actors inthe field, such as MONUC and key bilaterals.&#13;

32.      The Project is expected to be fundedthrough a US$50 millioncredit (to finance&#13;
the balance ofpayments support component) and a US$164 milliongrant provided under&#13;
the IDA 13 framework (to finance the four other components, implementation costs, and&#13;
contingencies).&#13;
&#13;
33.      Underthe IDA13 Grants Guidelines, it is expected that grants use would be&#13;
guidedby TSS priorities with investments ineducation, health, and key infrastructurefor&#13;
improving living conditions as important components. Activities proposed under the&#13;
Project are inline with priorities identified inthe TSS and are expected to include&#13;
investments in education, health, and clean water. Other considerations justifying the&#13;
allocation o f grant resources to finance this Project include: (i)the proposed grant has&#13;
beendesigned inaccordance with OP 2.30; (ii)early performance is promising as&#13;
evidenced by the DRC Government having taken substantial steps towards social and&#13;
economic recovery; and (iii) concerted international effort to provide positive financial&#13;
                               a&#13;
flows and other assistance is underway.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LESSONS    LEARNED REFLECTED&#13;
                      AND                INTHE DESIGNOF THE PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
34.      The overall architecture of the Project reflects lessons learned, through Bank&#13;
interventions inother post-conflict countries, as well as through earlier interventions in&#13;
DRC, and inparticular:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0   Early intervention is critical to help stabilize fragile political and social situations&#13;
         indifficult post-conflict environments-including both significant financial&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                          -20-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     assistance (including to balance o f payments) and analytical and advisory support.&#13;
     Such assistance has proven most usefbl when it has been directed at restoring a&#13;
     sound basic framework for economic governance, at providing rapid "peace&#13;
     dividends" to impoverishedpopulations, and at preparing for long-term recovery&#13;
     activities. Ina situation like DRC, there is a consensus that creating economic&#13;
     opportunities would go a long way towards stabilizing the social situation and&#13;
     improvingthe security situation. Inparticular, many actors consider that the&#13;
     "Mayi Mayi phenomenon" i s largely a consequence of the lack o f economic&#13;
     opportunities ina context o f extreme poverty.&#13;
&#13;
     Multi-sector approaches are neededfor emergency assistance to have a&#13;
     substantial impact on growth prospects and social stability ina highly-disrupted&#13;
     environment. Eventhough multi-sector operations may be more difficult to&#13;
     manage, effective interventions need to address inparallel a broad variety o f&#13;
     issues.&#13;
&#13;
35.  The Project's design also reflects lessons learned, and inparticular:&#13;
&#13;
     The need to involveprivate sector and civil society in the selection ofpriority&#13;
     activities. Priorities were selected through a broad consultation with all key&#13;
     stakeholders - and the proposed activities reflect a large consensus among all&#13;
     stakeholders. This will help ensure that resources are spent wisely and that&#13;
     benefits are widely shared -and facilitate the mobilization o fthe Congolese in&#13;
     support o f Bank-funded activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0 The need topay particular attention to issues of transparency, inparticular in&#13;
     countries such as DRC with a poor track record in financial management. This i s&#13;
     critical both to ensure a proper use o f emergency resources and to facilitate the&#13;
     mobilization o f further donor support. Ring-fenced procedures are neededto&#13;
     ensure an effective and transparent implementation process.&#13;
&#13;
     Thefeasibility of overcoming the difficult capacity constraints, as demonstrated&#13;
     through the successful implementation o f the EERP and ERC, and the promising&#13;
     beginnings o fthe EMRRProject. The proposed implementation arrangements for&#13;
     the Project draw on this experience.&#13;
&#13;
     The importance of simplicity andflexibility in design. Inrapidly-changing&#13;
     situations, where the difficulties to come cannot be fully foreseen, experience&#13;
     shows the importance o f designing activities and implementation mechanisms&#13;
     which allow for a flexible and rapid response to emerging needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0 The role of hands-on support by the Bank during implementation tofacilitate&#13;
    project execution. Particular attention needs to be paid duringimplementation to&#13;
     transparency as well as quality and sustainability o f selected activities.&#13;

&#13;
COMPLEMENTARYACTIVITIES&#13;
&#13;
36.     The proposed Project is not an isolated effort: it is part of a broader set of actions,&#13;
by IDA and other donors, which are aimed at supporting the process of economic and&#13;
social reunification inDRC:&#13;
&#13;
        OngoingIDA activities. Within the overall context o fthe Bank- and IMF-&#13;
        supported economic program, the proposed Project i s complementary to ongoing&#13;
        IDAprojects, inparticular the ERC, which supports economic reforms, the EEW&#13;
        and E M W , which provide financial support to rehabilitation and community         '&#13;
        development in Government-controlled areas, and the PSDCP, which aims to&#13;
        facilitate the resumption o f private sector activity. It complements these projects&#13;
        by focusing on regions where the Bank has not beenactive yet.&#13;
&#13;
        Planned IDA activities. The Project is expected to be implementedinparallel&#13;
        with two other projects currently underpreparation, an HIV/AIDS Project and a&#13;
        Demobilization and ReintegrationProject. The Project and these two operations&#13;
        are expected to be complementary both interms o f focus (the Project aims at&#13;
        supporting overall economic recovery and the two operations focus on specific&#13;
        issues which are critical for stability) and implementationmechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
        Other donors activities. A number o f other donors are implementing, or are&#13;
        planning to implement, activities inreunifiedprovinces. The proposed Project i s&#13;
        complementary to such programs: components and activities were selected in&#13;
        consultation with other donors, and best use will be made o f in-the-field&#13;
        coordination mechanisms to ensure a maximum synergy betweenactivities&#13;
        financed under the Project and activities financed by other donors.&#13;
&#13;
        Medium and long-term programs. The Project will focus on removing some o f&#13;
        the key bottlenecks for a smooth and successful process o f economic andsocial&#13;
        reunification - but substantial, targeted, program o f rehabilitation, reconstruction,&#13;
        and capacity enhancement will be neededto continue and expand this initial&#13;
        effort. It i s expected that a number o f complementary activities will be fundedby&#13;
        IDA and other donors inthe years to come, withinthe context o f an extended&#13;
        EMRRP. The Project aims to prepare for such an extension, by (i)       contributing to&#13;
       maintaining the economic reform program on track, (ii)       helping to restore basic&#13;
        institutional capacity and, (iii)financing feasibility studies for large scale&#13;
        infrastructure rehabilitation.&#13;
&#13;
   0    Otherforms of assistance. The Project's success will critically depend on the&#13;
       effective provision o f non-economic support -through contributions to the&#13;
       MONUC, to help restore and maintain security introubled areas, political&#13;
       facilitation, to accompany the political process o f reunification, and continued&#13;
       humanitarian assistance, which will be neededfor some time to come and will be&#13;
       delivered inparallel with Project implementation(with a focus on the poorest and&#13;
       most vulnerable people).&#13;

proposed Component i s to helpthe Government face the fiscal shock associated with       ,&#13;
reunification, inorder to allow for the ongoing economic stabilization andreform&#13;
program to remain on track.&#13;
&#13;
38.      Resources will be provided within the context o f the economic program supported&#13;
by the Bretton Woods institutions, with a view to financing critical imports necessary for&#13;
the overall success o fthe recovery and reunification process. This is critical inparticular&#13;
to: (i)restore sound economic governance inthese areas; (ii)   ensure country-wide&#13;
implementation o f reforms undertaken by the Government, and (iii)     helpre-establish a&#13;
basic capacity for social services delivery, and contribute to alleviating the ongoing social&#13;
and humanitarian crisis.&#13;
&#13;
Current status of the economic program&#13;
&#13;
39.      Over the last two years, the Government has embarked on an ambitious and far-&#13;
reaching program o f economic stabilization and structural reform. The initial steps o f the&#13;
program, monitored by the IMF under a Staff Monitored Program (SMP), were&#13;
satisfactorily implemented. Economic reforms are now continuing within the framework&#13;
o f a three-year program (April 2002 to July 2005) supported by the IMF under a US$750&#13;
million PRGF (approved inJune 2002) and by the Bank through the US$450 million&#13;
ERC. Under this program, the Government is to focus on further macro-economic&#13;
stabilization, improved fiscal management, increased social spending (particularly on&#13;
healthand education), and key structural reforms. Key steps taken to date are&#13;
summarized below:&#13;
&#13;
         Macro-economic stabilization. Since floating the Congolese franc inApril 2001,&#13;
         the Government has maintainedtight fiscal andmonetary control. The results of&#13;
         these efforts are impressive,even though they remain fragile and need to be&#13;
         further consolidated. After ten years ofnegative growth, real GDP reached 3&#13;
         percent in 2002, while inflation fell to 13 percent. Current forecasts for the&#13;
         coming years are encouraging (see table below).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  Budgetaryperformance. Revenues have increased to 5.9 percent o f GDP in2001&#13;
  (above the SMP target o f 5.2 percent), and to 7.9 percent in2002 - and measures&#13;
  are beingtaken to tighten budget execution and expenditure tracking withinthe&#13;
  context o f an ongoing Public Expenditure Review (PER) supported by the Bank&#13;
  (a draft o f the Review was made available inSeptember 2002 and its key&#13;
  recommendations are reflected inthe 2003 budget).&#13;
&#13;
  Poverty Reduction Strategy. The InterimPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper (1-&#13;
  PRSP) was completed and presented to the Boards o f the World Bank and IMFin&#13;
  June 2002. This strategy was designed through a broad consultative process&#13;
  within Government-controlled areas, which raised considerable interest among&#13;
  civil society stakeholders. Representatives o f reunifiedprovinces, including civil&#13;
  society, endorsed the strategy during the inter-Congolese dialogue in Sun City.&#13;
  Both the Bank's and the IMF's Boards commended the Congolese authorities for&#13;
  these efforts, and for the level o f participation that hadbeenachieved inspite o f a&#13;
  difficult post-conflict context. The preparation o f a full Poverty Reduction&#13;
  Strategy Paper (PRSP) is underway.&#13;
&#13;
  Transparency. The Government established inlate August 2002 an Anti-&#13;
  corruption Commission- and a similar commission was set up by civil society to&#13;
  act as an independent watchdog. Audits o f the tax and customs administration, as&#13;
  well as most public enterprises, were publishedinthe local press (leading to the&#13;
  replacement o f a number o f public officials and managers).&#13;
&#13;
  Financial sector reform. Audits have beencompleted for the Central Bank and&#13;
  the main commercial banks. Most o f the 17 mainfinancial institutions are ina&#13;
  critical condition (over 60 percent o f the portfolios are innon-performing assets)&#13;
  and have recorded severe losses -and eight of them have to be liquidated. A new&#13;
  law was adopted in February 2002 to provide a framework for micro-finance&#13;
  activities (inparticular accounting and loans recovery).&#13;
&#13;
  Public enterprises reform. Followingthe completion o f govemance audits (which&#13;
  resulted inthe replacement o f most state-own enterprises' managers), the&#13;
  Government has recruited reputedintemational consulting groups to conduct in-&#13;
  depthoperational and functional audits. Inparallel, a Steering Committee (the&#13;
  Comite`de Pilotage de la Re`forme des Entreprises Publiques, COPIREP) has been&#13;
  established in October 2002 under the Ministry at the Presidency to oversee this&#13;
  process.&#13;
&#13;
0 Private investment, As a first step o f an effort to revive private sector activity, a&#13;
  new investment code, preparedwith the support o f the World Bank, was&#13;
  promulgated inFebruary 2002. A new labor code was approved by the&#13;
  Parliament inparallel. International investors have started to respond with a total&#13;
  o f about US$1.3 billion innew investments submittedto the National Agency for&#13;
  Investment Promotion, including several large investmentscurrently underway.&#13;
  The Government is also taking steps to join inthe African Trade Insurance&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               - 24 -&#13;
&#13;
          Agency, so that short-term transactions (up to three years) can be covered against&#13;
          political risk. These actions are complemented by efforts aimed at strengthening&#13;
          thejudiciary with the support ofthe EuropeanUnion.&#13;
&#13;
          Mining andforestry sectors. New miningand forestry codes were promulgatedin&#13;
          July 2002 and September 2002 respectively - laying the ground for recovery in&#13;
          sectors which are key bothto spur economic growth and to increase export&#13;
          revenues. These codes, prepared with the support o fthe World Bank, reflect&#13;
          international best practices, to attract foreign investors and enhance transparency&#13;
          insectors where widespread corruptionhasprevailed for several decades. Effotts&#13;
          are now underway to re-establish an accurate miningcadastre (which has not been&#13;
          systematically updated since 1974) and review the forestry concessions awarded&#13;
          to date. The Government has also taken preliminary steps to restructure state-&#13;
          owned miningcompanies (inparticular GCcamines).&#13;
&#13;
  The continued debt burden&#13;
&#13;
  40.     Over the past decades, weak policies and conflict, compounded by sometimes&#13;
  misguidedborrowing and lendingdecisions, have produced an unsustainable debt burden&#13;
  -andDRCisoneofthemostdebt-ladenIDAcountries. Thankstoconsiderableefforts&#13;
  by both DRC Government and its creditors, critical steps have beentaken for clearing&#13;
  arrears, which were preventingthe re-engagement o f key development partners. Arrears&#13;
  to the IMF and the World Bank were cleared inJune and July 2002 respectively, and a&#13;
  clearance plan was agreed upon and funded for the African Development Bank's arrears.&#13;
  Paris Club creditors met in September 2002 and agreed to a generous restructuring o f&#13;
  DRC's external debt. Furthermore, DRC reached its Decision Point inJuly 2003 and&#13;
  became eligible for debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative from all o f its creditors&#13;
  for a total amount o f approximately US$10 billion innominal terms (or US$6.3 billion in&#13;
  net present value terms over time).&#13;
&#13;
  41.     Despite these efforts, however, scheduled debt service i s expected to remain very&#13;
  high, and will still represent 30 to 45 percent o f expected Government revenues between&#13;
  2003 and 2006. With such a highlevel o f commitments, the Government will not have&#13;
  sufficient room to support key activities necessary for the success o f the reunification&#13;
  process. External assistance i s thus still needed to help face the challenges associated&#13;
  with reunification, and to keepthe overall recovery program on track.&#13;
&#13;
  Emergingpriorities associatedwith reunification&#13;
&#13;
  42.     All participants inthe inter-Congolese dialogue have endorsed the economic&#13;
. program and called for its continued implementation. Still, the reunification process is&#13;
  taking place ina context o f acute social and humanitarian crisis - and new challenges are&#13;
  emerging, which could result inpartly or wholly derailing the program. Inthe coming&#13;
  period, and in line with its strategy, the Government has a two-fold agenda to facilitate&#13;
  the process of economic and social reunificationto be successful:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              - 2 5 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Ensure key economic reforms are implemented throughout the country. Key&#13;
         reforms already undertaken on the Government side have to be implemented&#13;
         throughout the country, inorder to maintainthe hard-won macroeconomic&#13;
         stability, restore sound economic governance, and create an environment for&#13;
         private sector-led growth inthe northern and eastern provinces. Critical issues&#13;
         include: (i)fiscal mobilization, (ii)transparency inthe management of public&#13;
         resources, (iii) public expenditure management, (iv) private sector activities, (v)&#13;
         exploitation o f natural resources, (vi) public enterprises reform, and (vii) financial&#13;
         sector reform. Specific action plans and indicators have been or will be defined&#13;
         within the context o fthe economic policy dialogue with the Bank andthe IMF.`&#13;
&#13;
         Restore reun@ed, decentralized, andfunctioning institutions. This will require&#13;
         first and foremost to resume wage payment to civil servants, as a critical pre-&#13;
         condition for public institutions to function. Efforts will also be needed to&#13;
         reintegrate long-divided entities into countrywide institutions, while maintaining&#13;
         an adequate degree o f local autonomy and decentralization. Specific action plans&#13;
         and indicators will be defined at sectoral level, inparticular with the support of&#13;
         activities funded under the Project's institutional strengthening component.&#13;
&#13;
 Designand implementationarrangements&#13;
&#13;
 43.     The Bank has gained experience inproviding adjustment support to DRC, with&#13;
 the successful implementation o fthe US$450 million ERC approved in June 2002. This&#13;
 Credit has played a key role for the normalization o f the DRC's relations with its external&#13;
 creditors, as well as for supporting the earlier stages of the economic reformprocess.&#13;
 Resources provided through the ERC have beenput to good use and have contributed to&#13;
 restoring a minimal capacity for both economic governance and social services delivery.&#13;
 Provisiono f further balance o f payments support to appears to be both a critical and an&#13;
 effective mean to support Government's efforts within the context o f the reunification&#13;
 process.&#13;
&#13;
 44.     The Government is committed to implementthe two-fold agenda o f reform&#13;
 necessary for the success o f the process o f economic and social reunification. Inview o f&#13;
 the existing track record, and to avoid cross-conditionality with other operations&#13;
 supporting economic reforms, there will be no specific macro-economic trigger for the&#13;
 releaseo f funds under the component. This i s consistent with OP 8.50 (Operational&#13;
 Policy on Emergency Recovery Assistance) under which the Project i s prepared.&#13;
&#13;
 45.     The balance of payments component will support and facilitate implementation of&#13;
 the Government's two-fold agenda. It is expected to permit the continuation o fkey&#13;
*recovery programs by financing critical imports, otherwise likely to be affected by fiscal&#13;
 resource constraints caused by the needto respond to the emergency, and contribute to&#13;
 stabilize the macro economy, by reducingthe fiscal deficit and making additional foreign&#13;
 exchange available.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            - 2 6 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
46.     Funds will be deposited into a special deposit account opened inU S dollars and&#13;
held inthe name o f the Ministry o f Finance at the Central Bank o f Congo. These&#13;
resources will be usedto finance critical imports on a positive list (see Appendix C) to&#13;
help address priority issues associated with the reunification, through (i) financing critical&#13;
imports for public institutions; and (ii)&#13;
                                        constituting a counterpart fund, which the&#13;
Government intendsto use to finance the resumption o f salary payments for key civil&#13;
servants. Inaggregate, the imports financed on Government's account and the&#13;
counterpart generated from private sector imports will be used to support the transfer o f&#13;
resources to reunified provinces, so as to restore essential institutions and facilitate an&#13;
effective resumption o f social services delivery. Retroactive financing will be allowed to&#13;
cover imports contracted as o f July 1,2003, up to an aggregate value o f US$lO million.&#13;
&#13;
47.     Government expenditure management and processes are being reinforced within&#13;
the context o f the ongoing PER and with hands-on technical assistance from the IMF -to&#13;
ensure that public resources are beingused appropriately. The Ministry o f Finance will&#13;
set up accounting and tracking arrangements, similar to those under the ERC, to ensure&#13;
that resources from the Component (including counterpart funds) are committed and&#13;
expended inaccordance with the revisedbudgetary procedures and expendituretracking&#13;
arrangements currently being set up with the support o f the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
48.     Implementation o f the Component will be overseen and monitored by the high-&#13;
level, inter-ministerialcommittee responsible for implementingthe economic program&#13;
supported by the Bretton Woods Institutions. The overall reform program will be&#13;
reviewed by the Government inclose coordination with regular Bank and IMF missions&#13;
to ensure continued implementation o f all reforms within a sound macroeconomic&#13;
framework.&#13;
&#13;
Cost breakdown&#13;

&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
50.     This component aims to complement existing capacity enhancement programs (in&#13;
particular under the EMRR Project) with a specific focus on some o f the key issues&#13;
associated with the process o f economic and social reunification. Support under the&#13;
component will include the provision o f external expertise, training, and equipment (such&#13;
as computers) to selected institutions, as may be necessary.&#13;
&#13;
51.     Inview o fthe limitedresources and short timeframe, the Project will provide&#13;
selective support to remove some o f the most critical bottlenecks, with the overall&#13;
objectives of: (i)restoring essential administrative capacity for sound economic&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             -27-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
governance inreunifiedprovinces, including with regardto revenue mobilization and&#13;
public expenditure management; (ii)     assisting inthe Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper&#13;
(PRSP) process; (iii)   supporting the restoration o f effective institutions inthe forestry&#13;
sector inreunified provinces (complementing parallel efforts under the PSDCP inthe&#13;
miningsector); (iv) meeting the twin challenges of institutional reunification and&#13;
decentralization; and (v) carrying out engineering and other studies to prepare for an&#13;
extension o f the EMRRP.&#13;
&#13;
Mechanismsfor flexibility and priority areas&#13;
&#13;
52.      Needs for institutional strengthening are expectedto evolve rapidly as the process&#13;
o f economic and social reunification unfolds. Experience inDRC and inother countries&#13;
shows that flexibility i s key to providing the type o f support that i s needed insuch a&#13;
fragile and rapidly-changing post-conflict environment. The designo f the component&#13;
consists therefore o f two elements:&#13;
&#13;
         Mechanismsforflexibility -to ensure that responses can be provided with the&#13;
         adequate degree o f flexibility throughout project implementation; and&#13;
&#13;
     0   Narrow list ofpriority areas -to avoid that the necessary flexibility results ina&#13;
         dispersion o f efforts.&#13;
&#13;
53.      Mechanismsforflexibility. Specific needs will be identified by the Government&#13;
throughout the implementation period, inclose consultation with the relevant technical&#13;
entities as well as with the Bank and the IMF wherever relevant. The Government will&#13;
formalize these needs through semiannual implementationand procurement plans&#13;
(including terms o f reference and technical specifications), which will be submittedto the&#13;
Bank for no-objection. The Bank will ensure that terms o f reference for each individual&#13;
activity includes clear deliverables against which progress can be measured (within the&#13;
context o f the economic policy dialogue or the preparation for the extension o f the&#13;
EMRRP). Once the no-objection i s provided, activities will be procured, as per agreed&#13;
procurement arrangements (which may include further no-objections). An initial&#13;
procurement plan for the year satisfactory to the Bank will be finalized by effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
54.     List ofpriority areas. Inview o f the limitedresources available, selectivity i s&#13;
critical. The Project will therefore support only a limited set o f activities, aimed at&#13;
addressing critical issues for which rapid progress i s possible. Priority areas will be:&#13;
&#13;
        Economic governance and reform (US34 million). Support will aim to&#13;
        complement efforts under the EEW and IMF technical assistance program, to&#13;
        enhance capacity, with a focus on reunified provinces, within the context o f&#13;
        institutional reunification. Priorities will be four-fold:&#13;
&#13;
                (0 Improve revenue generating capacity. Efforts will focus on&#13;
                strengtheningcapacity for fiscal administration, customs administration,&#13;
                and the Central Bank, ineastern and northern provinces.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                      - 28 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         (ii) Improve capacity to managepublic resources. Support will be&#13;
        provided within the broader context o f the ongoing PER, with a focus on&#13;
        strengthening public resource management inreunifiedprovinces.&#13;
&#13;
        (iii) Strengthen transparency. Support will aim to extend the scope o f&#13;
        recent reforms to the entire country. Initial activities will include:&#13;
        extending activities o f the recently-established Anti-Corruption&#13;
        Commission; conducting audits o fthe tax and customs administrations;&#13;
        screening public service payroll, with a view to identifying and removing&#13;
        "ghost workers"; and building a constituency for the fight against&#13;
        corruption, through information sessions and public debates.&#13;
&#13;
        (iv) Improve public dissemination and debate on economic reforms. The&#13;
        Component will aim to replicate a successful effort funded under the&#13;
        EERPto buildsupport for the reform process through information and&#13;
        public debate -with a focus on reaching stakeholders inthe eastern and&#13;
        northernparts o f the country.&#13;
&#13;
Support to the PRSPprocess (US$4 million). The preparation o f a solid and&#13;
broadly participatory PRSP i s a critical element o f the process of economic and&#13;
social reunification: it i s through this process that the consensus on priorities for&#13;
country-wide recovery can be consolidated and translated into operational plans.&#13;
The Project will provide financial andtechnical assistance to ensure the breadth&#13;
and quality o f the participatory process, inparticular inreunifiedprovinces - and&#13;
to finance the sectoral surveys and other analytical work necessary for the&#13;
preparation o f sound sectoral strategies. This will be undertaken in close&#13;
coordination with other donors, with a view to complementing activities for which&#13;
financing is already inplace.&#13;
&#13;
Forestry reforms (US4 million). The Project will support re-unification of&#13;
DRC's forest institutions, and help improve local governance over natural&#13;
resources (two thirds of DRC's huge forest endowment are located inreunified&#13;
provinces). Inparticular, it will help bring into practice the provisions o f the new&#13;
Forestry Code and help address the issue o f illegal logging. It will also support&#13;
sound environmental management. Activities will be oriented towards&#13;
developing local processes and ownership rather thanjust delivering outputs. In&#13;
linewith the recommendations o fa sector institutional review, activities under the&#13;
Project will be articulated around two major sets o fpriorities:&#13;
&#13;
        (0 Prepare aforest zoningplan -with a focus on the most-forested&#13;
        provinces (inparticular Equateur and Province Orientale). This i s critical&#13;
        to secure landrights and transparent access to forest resources for all&#13;
        stakeholders. The Project will finance: mapping services and verifications&#13;
        on the ground, socio-economic assessments, facilitation o f local&#13;
        consultations to help Government and local stakeholders organize rural&#13;

&#13;
                 areas inthree broad categories according to their primary objectives (rural&#13;
                 development, sustainable production, environmental protection). The&#13;
                project will also provide basic training and equipment for forestry services&#13;
                to lead the planning process.&#13;
&#13;
                 (io Lay the groundfor implementation of the new law'sforest concession&#13;
                system - with a focus on converting old forest contracts into the new&#13;
                concession regime. The Project will finance methodological support and&#13;
                field verifications to: assess compliance with past obligations; re-design&#13;
                concessions boundaries where appropriate; and monitor preliminary steps&#13;
                by concession holders towards developing sound forest management&#13;
                plans. The Project will also support the setting up o f a forest information&#13;
                system, and the re-activation o f communication between central and local&#13;
                forestry services, as well as basic training and equipmentto strengthen&#13;
                capacity o f forestry services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   ReuniJication and decentralization ofpublic institutions (US$l million). Specific&#13;
        strategies and action plans are neededineach sector for a smooth and effective&#13;
        reunification o f key public institutions. This process will take place within the&#13;
        broader context o f reunification and the redefinition o f the respective resources&#13;
        and responsibilities o f central, provincial, and local levels o f Government. Itwill&#13;
        require a dialogue betweenrelevant stakeholders (including representatives o fthe&#13;
        Government, o f the various levels o f the relevant institutions, and o f users'&#13;
        associations), and a review o f experiences inother large countries. The Project&#13;
        will support this process inspecific sectors and for specific institutions, in&#13;
        coordination with efforts currently underway under the EMRRProject to develop&#13;
        sector strategies. The Project will finance facilitation services, workshops, and&#13;
        study tours as may be necessary, as well as the provision o f external expertise,&#13;
        studies, and audits. It may also include the limited provision of goods and works&#13;
        as needed.&#13;

        million). Support will be provided to carry out the technical studies which are&#13;
        necessary to prepare for the eventual extension o f the E M W throughout the&#13;
        country. These studies will focus on identifying sectoral priorities, scope o f&#13;
       works, and possible implementation mechanisms (and also include social and&#13;
        environmental studies as may be needed). They will be complementary to efforts&#13;
        currently underway under the EMRRProject to define sectoral strategies and&#13;
       prepare key sectoral reforms.&#13;

55.    The component will finance a number of activities, the exact nature and scope o f&#13;
which i s expected to evolve during implementation. An initial cost breakdown (inUS$&#13;
million) i s detailed inthe table below:&#13;

                 3:                     REHABILITATION&#13;
&#13;
  Objectives&#13;
&#13;
  56.     This component aims to build upon existing programs (inparticular the EERP and&#13;
  EMRRProject) to respond to emergency needs inreunifiedprovinces andto activate&#13;
  mechanisms for transparent and effective implementation o f large infrastructure works in&#13;
  these areas (as a key step towards broadening the coverage o f the EMRRP to all parts o f&#13;
  DRC).&#13;
&#13;
  57.     Support will focus on the rehabilitation of key transport links, which are critical&#13;
  for restoring movement o f goods and people -which i s a pre-condition for economic&#13;
  recovery, agricultural growth, and food security as well as for successful reunification o f&#13;
  a long-divided country. This i s expected to substantially reduce transport costs, and to&#13;
  restore links between production and consumption areas (inparticular for agricultural&#13;
  products) - with a high expected impact on agricultural outputs, incomes inrural areas,&#13;
  and prices o f basic commodities inurbancenters.&#13;
&#13;
  Selection of priority highways&#13;
&#13;
  Criteria&#13;
&#13;
  58.     While it would be desirable to launch a major transport rehabilitation program in&#13;
  the short-term, to facilitate reunificationas well as to reduce poverty inisolated areas, the&#13;
  limitations on existing institutional capacity, the lack o f information on the status o f some&#13;
  o f the mainhighways, and financial constraints impose to prioritize. The pre-war&#13;
 network included 58,300 kilometers o f national and regional roads, and about 86,600&#13;
  kilometers o f secondary and ruralroads - a total network o f 145,000 kilometers, o f which&#13;
  less than 2 percent was paved. Priority activities will be limited to rehabilitation o f&#13;
 existing, although damaged, infrastructure, and will not include new construction.&#13;
 Construction standards will aim to ensure no more than a "all seasons passable" status&#13;
. (given the level o f traffic expected during the first years, investment such as sealed roads&#13;
 are not economicallyjustified). Maintenance for an initial two-year period after&#13;
 rehabilitationwill be included.&#13;
&#13;
  59.     The selection o fpriority highways was made inclose coordination with all&#13;
 relevant stakeholders, including private sector, civil society, and administrative&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              - 3 1 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
authorities. Selection criteria included: (i)   expected economic impact interms o f&#13;
reduction o f transport time (and hence economic activity and prices inre-connected&#13;
areas); (ii)demographic density o f the re-connected areas (and of the adjacent areas); (ii)&#13;
relevance for the country's "physical" reunification; (iii)  security conditions; and (iv)&#13;
expected scope o f work.&#13;
&#13;
RiV 4 -Kisangani -Beni ($42 million)&#13;
&#13;
60.     O n the basis o f these criteria, there was a broad consensus among all stakeholders&#13;
that the highest priority should be givento rehabilitatingthe 750-kilometer highway&#13;
Kisangani - Beni(RN4):&#13;
&#13;
    0   Expected economic impact. Transport time from Buniato Kisangani i s currently&#13;
        estimated at up to two months, and the highway i s not passable duringthe rainy&#13;
        season. As a result, Kisangani, the third largest city in DRC, has lost its status o f&#13;
        an economically-active transit center, and the region i s currently essentially&#13;
        suppliedby air, including for basic commodities and industrial supplies -with a&#13;
        severe impact on price levels, economic activity, food security, and hence&#13;
       poverty. Transport o f goods to Kisangani costs about US$500 per ton (compared&#13;
       to pre-war levels o f US$35 per ton by road from the East, and US$15 per ton by&#13;
        the Congo river from Kinshasa). On the other side, the traditional food producing&#13;
        areas inthe Iturihave lost their main markets - which has significantly reduced&#13;
        rural incomes inthese areas. RN4 rehabilitation, which is seen by business in&#13;
        Kisangani and Beni as critical for the restart o f economic activities, i s hence&#13;
        expected to have a significant impact on food prices inKisangani, on agricultural&#13;
       production inthe Ituri region - as well as on economic prospects inthe entire&#13;
       Easternpart o f DRC.&#13;
&#13;
    0  Demographic density. Kisangani i s the third largest city inDRC - while Beni's&#13;
       region i s among the most-densely populatedparts o f the country.&#13;
&#13;
    0  Relevancefor reunzjkation. RN4 connects the eastern areas, administeredby&#13;
       RCD-Goma, with the Congo River and hence Kinshasa and the Government-&#13;
       controlled areas.&#13;
&#13;
    0  Security. At the time o f appraisal, the RN4 was under the control o f five&#13;
       different armed groups. These movements are relatively well-structured andtheir&#13;
       leaderships have indicated their support to the rehabilitation o f RN4 and their&#13;
       intention to guarantee the security o f contractors (for a variety o f reasons, each&#13;
       movement considers RN 4 rehabilitation as critical). The section Mambasa -&#13;
       Bunia, however, is currently highly insecure, but the rehabilitation o f this branch&#13;
       i s not critical to reach the desired objective (and thus i s not included inthe&#13;
       Project), provided the alternative Mambasa-Benii s made operational.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   Scope ofwork. Inview o f the current status o f the highway, major reduction o f&#13;
       transport time can be achieved with the limitedresources available under the&#13;

          bottlenecks (with a low standarddesign).&#13;
&#13;
 RN 2 -Bukavu -Mbuii-Mavi (US44 million)&#13;
&#13;
 61.      As a second priority, there was a consensus among stakeholders aroundthe&#13;
 rehabilitation o f the 780-kilometer highway Bukavu- Mbujo-Mayi (RN 2):&#13;
&#13;
          Expected economic impact. RN2 serves an area where economic activity (and in&#13;
          particular agriculture) i s largely dependant uponthe existence o f an all season .&#13;
          passable road connection. Traffic i s currently interrupted, essentially because the&#13;
          road crosses a former confrontation line, but also due to the deterioration o f&#13;
          physical infrastructure. The resumption o ftraffic between Mbuji-Mayi (a major&#13;
          center for diamond extraction) and Bukavu (a traditional food-producing area),&#13;
          and more broadly betweenthe eastern regions of the Kivus and the central regions&#13;
          o f the Kasais i s expectedto have a significant economic impact.&#13;
&#13;
    0     Demographic density. Both Bukavu and Mbuji-Mayi are large cities, which are&#13;
          both inthe center of densely-populated provinces (respectively the Kivus and the&#13;
          Kasais) to which they are relatively well connected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0     Relevancefor reunzjkation. RN2 connects the eastem areas, administered by&#13;
          RCD-Goma, with the RN 1 (Kinshasa to Lubumbashi) which i s the main link&#13;
          within territories formerly administeredby the Government and is currently being&#13;
          rehabilitated under the EMRR Project.&#13;
&#13;
    0     Security. At the time o f appraisal, the RN2 was essentially under the control o f&#13;
          RCD-Goma and Government troops. Within the context o f national reunification,&#13;
          security should hence be adequate along this road for rehabilitation works to be&#13;
          carried out.&#13;
&#13;
    0     Scope of work. The itinerary i s inpoor condition. It consists mainly o f a 4- to 6-&#13;
          meter wide earth structure with bad drainage, deteriorated surface courses, and&#13;
          damaged bridges and ferries. Major reduction o f transport time can be achieved&#13;
          with the limitedresources available under the Project, particularly ifresources are&#13;
          focused on removing some o f the key bottlenecks (with a low standard design).&#13;
&#13;
 RN 1-Matadi - Mpozo ($4 million)&#13;
&#13;
 62.      The Project will also finance rehabilitation on RN 1 from the Mpozo bridge to the&#13;
*port o f Matadi to complete works currently underwayunder the EERP.&#13;
&#13;
 63.      Benefits o f including these works inthe Component (rather than financing them&#13;
 through a supplemental) include:&#13;

&#13;
    0   Minimizing the administrative burdenassociated with the preparation and&#13;
        implementation o f a supplemental, for institutions whose capacity is&#13;
        compromised;&#13;
&#13;
        Signaling the importance o f carrying out works throughout the country (and not&#13;
        only inreunifiedprovinces) for the success o f reunification -with a symbolic   '&#13;
        element, since the works betweenKinshasa and Matadi are critical to complement&#13;
        works on RN4 and to ensure a continued link throughout the entire country, from&#13;
        the Atlantic Ocean to the Eastemborders.&#13;
&#13;
Overall transport network&#13;
&#13;
64.     After completion o f the works, DRC will have four major, inter-connected links,&#13;
which will provide the backbone o f the transport network (these links are all passable -&#13;
although some o f them are inpoor condition): (i) 1 from Matadi to Kinshasato&#13;
                                                      RN&#13;
Lubumbashi (West to South East), currently rehabilitated under the EMRR Project; (ii)&#13;
Congo River from Kinshasa to Kisangani (West to Center); (iii) 4 from Kisangani to&#13;
                                                                  RN&#13;
Beni (Center to North East); (iv) RN4, currently passable inmost sections from Benito&#13;
Bukavu (along the eastern border); and (v) RN2, from Bukavu to Mbuji-Mayi and RN 1.&#13;
&#13;
Natureof the activitiesfinanced underthe Component&#13;
&#13;
RN 4 rehabilitation&#13;
&#13;
65.     Rehabilitation works aim to ensure that RN4 becomes passable inall seasons.&#13;
Prior to the conflict, RN4 was an unpaved highway, about 7-meter wide. The works will&#13;
be designed to optimize the use of the resources available, by prioritizing repairs and&#13;
focusing on the most critical bottlenecks, which can be removed within the available&#13;
allocation.&#13;
&#13;
66.     Six types o f works have been identified:&#13;
&#13;
    e   Rehabilitation o f key bridges (there are 43 bridgeson the main itinerary,&#13;
        including 3 which are over 100meter long, and 6 which are between 30 and 100&#13;
        meters long); most o f these bridges are damaged, and can no longer sustain heavy&#13;
        traffic without some rehabilitation;&#13;
&#13;
    e   Repairs o f the most damaged sections (e.g., where the road has collapsed due to&#13;
        landslides), for a total lengthestimated at about 250 kilometers;&#13;
&#13;
    0   Patching on less damaged paved sections (e.g., major holes) and clearing&#13;
        vegetation;&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Backfilling on about 20 percent o fthe road;&#13;
&#13;
    0   Levelling with filling on about 40 percent o f the road; and&#13;
&#13;
    0   Cleaning o f ditches and maintenance o f shoulders on the entire highway&#13;
&#13;
67.     Inthe current context, prices for these works can only be estimated with a&#13;
significant margin o f uncertainty. Would financing allow, these works would be&#13;
complementedby additional rehabilitationworks on a branch road towards Isiro (a major&#13;
population center inthe Province Orientale).&#13;
&#13;
RN 2 rehabilitation&#13;
&#13;
68.     For RN2 too, works will aim at ensuring the road i s passable inall seasons by&#13;
prioritizing repairs within the available financial envelope. Six types o f works have been&#13;
identified:&#13;
&#13;
    0   Rehabilitation o f key bridges (there are 55 bridges, including 30 wood bridges, 15&#13;
        steel bridges, and 10 concrete bridges) and the two key cable ferries; most o f the&#13;
        bridges are damaged, and can no longer sustain heavy traffic without some&#13;
        rehabilitation;&#13;
&#13;
    0   Repairs o f the most damaged sections (e.g., where the road has collapsed due to&#13;
        landslides), for a total lengthestimated at about 150 kilometers;&#13;
&#13;
    0   Patching on less damagedpaved sections (e.g., major holes) and clearing&#13;
        vegetation;&#13;
&#13;
    0   Backfilling on about 10 percent o f the road;&#13;
&#13;
    0   Levelling with filling on about 60 percent o f the road; and&#13;
&#13;
    0   Cleaning of ditches and maintenance of shoulders on the entire highway&#13;
&#13;
69.     Would financing allow, these works would be complemented by additional&#13;
rehabilitationworks on a branch road towards Kindu(the capital of the Manima&#13;
province).&#13;
&#13;
RN 4 and RN 2 maintenance&#13;
&#13;
70.     The Project will finance maintenance o fthe rehabilitated road for a two-year&#13;
period (pending the establishment o f an adequate country-wide systemof maintenance,&#13;
which i s currently to be designedunder the EMRR Project). Such maintenance will be&#13;
contracted through a performance-based arrangement with an agreed level o f service&#13;

&#13;
   (average speed o f 40 M h r for a truck throughout the itineraries). These activities will&#13;
   be part o fthe respective contracts awardedfor rehabilitationo fRN4 and RN2.&#13;
&#13;
   71.     Maintenance is expected to rely to a large extent on communities living along the&#13;
   roads. Particular attention will be paidto ensuring that people working on the RN4 and&#13;
   R N 2 maintenance receive a fair compensation for their work - since the use o f coerced&#13;
   labor for regularhighway maintenance has often beencommon practice insome parts o f&#13;
   DRC. Usingunpaid workers, evenunder the name of"community participation", would&#13;
   not only be unethical but also raise significant reputationalrisks for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
   RN I rehabilitation&#13;
&#13;
   72.     Activities are designed to complement rehabilitationcurrently underway under&#13;
   the EEW, through the rehabilitation of a 10-kilometer section between the Matadi and&#13;
   the Mpozo bridge. This includes patching, backfilling, cleaning of ditches, and&#13;
   maintenance o f shoulders.&#13;

&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
74.      This component aims to helpactivate adequate implementation mechanisms for&#13;
rehabilitation o f local infrastructure and service delivery inurbanareas located in&#13;
reunified provinces -while relieving some o f the economic and social hardshipcaused&#13;
by the successive crisis inthese areas. It will build on experience to date with the EERP&#13;
andthe ESRP, which have relied onNGOs to overcome the relative lack o f&#13;
administrative capacity, to mobilize communities, private operators, and civil society      .&#13;
groups, and to ensure transparency inthe use o f resources.&#13;
&#13;
75.      The component i s expected to facilitate recovery and consolidate social stability&#13;
inpotentially explosive urban centers -which is critical for the eventual successofthe&#13;
reunification process. It will inparticular help to generate employment opportunities for&#13;
the rural poor through the use o f labor intensivemethods. Such employment&#13;
opportunities will inparticular, but not exclusively, benefit former combatants, as part o f&#13;
efforts aimed at disarming, demobilizing, and reintegratingthem.&#13;
&#13;
Overall design&#13;
&#13;
76.      The Project will distinguishbetweenthe four main cities inthe reunified&#13;
provinces (namely Bukavu, Goma, Kindu, and Kisangani), and smaller cities (with&#13;
populations between 50,000 and 500,000). While there remains some capacity inthe&#13;
largest cities (inparticular inthe private sector), the situation is very different in smaller&#13;
urban centers, where implementation capacity i s very limited. Two different approaches&#13;
will hence be used.&#13;
&#13;
77.      The component will be implementedunder the overall responsibility of a&#13;
consulting firm (the Urban Rehabilitation Management Firm), which will operate under a&#13;
service contract with the Government. This entity will inturn enter into contractual&#13;
agreements with private contractors (for large cities) and accredited NGOs (for smaller&#13;
cities) for the execution o f rehabilitation activities. Implementation will be accompanied&#13;
with a strong information campaign, to ensure the effective involvement o f local&#13;
populations inthe monitoring o f activities.&#13;
&#13;
Activities in large cities&#13;
&#13;
78.      The Project will include activities inthe four largest urbanareas ineastern and&#13;
northern DRC: Bukavu, Goma, Kindu, and Kisangani.&#13;
&#13;
79.      Support will be provided intwo tranches:&#13;
&#13;
    0    Underthe first tranche, each city will be allocated US$3 millionto finance a&#13;
         series of activities identified through consultation with local authorities, private&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 - 37-&#13;
&#13;
           sector, and civil society. Detailed procurement plans for each city will be&#13;
           finalized within three months after effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
           The second tranche will be launched after one year o f implementation. Based on&#13;
           implementationperformance inthe first phase, each city will be allocated an&#13;
           additional amount, for an overall total o f US$6 million, subject to the submission&#13;
           o f a corresponding list o f priority activities selected through a broad consultative&#13;
           process (and the correspondingprocurement plan).&#13;
&#13;
  80.      Activities will be implemented under works, goods, and services contracts, with&#13;
  private companies or NGOs. While the private sector has tremendously suffered from the&#13;
  conflict inall three cities, there remain some enterprises with some capacity to carry out&#13;
  rehabilitation and recovery activities. To the extent possible, best use will be made o f&#13;
  this capacity, andNGOs will beusedmostly as arecourse where there is no qualified&#13;
  contractor.&#13;
&#13;
  Activities in smaller cities&#13;
&#13;
  81.      The component will be implementedinurbanareas where there i s some NGO and&#13;
  private sector capacity, and where prevailing security conditions are adequate for&#13;
  development activities to be implemented. While it may be desirable to launchthe&#13;
  program in every urban center as early as possible, rolling out such a program through&#13;
  devastated areas with limited administrative capacity would be daunting. Hence, it i s&#13;
  proposed to proceed intwo phases:&#13;
&#13;
           Inthe first phase, implementation will be launchedineight cities, which were&#13;
           selected by the Government -namely Bumba, Butembo, Isiro, Kalima, Kalemie,&#13;
           Kasongo, Lusambo, Uvira.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       0   The second phase will be launched after one year o f implementation, and may&#13;
           include: (i) support to additional urban centers (a comprehensive list o f additional&#13;
           beneficiary will be preparedby the Government, on the basis o f population,&#13;
           poverty, and security criteria, and will be submitted to the Bank for no-objection);&#13;
           and (ii) additional support to selected urban centers, which have already benefited&#13;
           from an initial allocation and where implementation performance has been&#13;
           satisfactory (each city will be eligible for a maximum o f three allocations over the&#13;
           duration o f the project).&#13;
&#13;
  82.     Implementation in smaller cities inreunified provinces will face particular&#13;
  difficulties: the private sector has suffered considerable damage due to the conflict, and&#13;
. civil society does not have the capacity to handlelarge financial resources with adequate&#13;
 transparency. Still, over the last years, a number o f local and foreign NGOs have been&#13;
 active inthe reunified provinces. Their programs were initially focused on the provision&#13;
 o f humanitarian assistance but they are gradually shifting to activities with an increasing&#13;
 economic recovery component. This experience and the associated administrative&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
capacity that has beendeveloped over the years are important assets for assistance&#13;
programs to be implemented inurbanareas and their vicinity.&#13;
&#13;
83.      Implementationwill hence rely on accredited NGOs which will be hiredby the&#13;
Urban RehabilitationManagement Firmthrough service contracts and will work partly or&#13;
largely through local contractors. Accredited agencies can be either UNagencies,&#13;
execution agencies o f international donors, or NGOs. Pre-requisites for accreditation o f&#13;
NGOs will be basedon criteria under the EERP and ESRP and include: (i)legal     a&#13;
personality inthe DRC (or a proper registration with the authorities inthe case o f&#13;
international NGOs); (ii)demonstrated technical competence for the project to be            .&#13;
executed; (iii)  presentation o f independently-audited financial statements for at least one&#13;
year preceding its request for financing; and (iv) demonstrated capacity to manage&#13;
procurement, to maintain books, and account for financial activities. To support efforts&#13;
toward rebuilding key public institutions, preference will be given to NGOs with a track&#13;
record o f effective cooperation with local authorities. There are currently several entities&#13;
active inbeneficiary cities which could rapidly obtain qualification.&#13;
&#13;
84.      The use ofNGOs, however, needs to be designed ina manner that preventstwo&#13;
pitfalls: (i)exceedingly highoperating costs (international NGOs active ineastem and&#13;
northern DRC commonly charge over 25 to 30 percent) and (ii)         de-capacitating o f local&#13;
institutions and private sector. This will be achieved through:&#13;
&#13;
         The use of competition to recruit the NGOs. The Urban Rehabilitation&#13;
         Management Firmwill be asked to implementa pre-agreed competitive process.&#13;
         Beneficiary cities and available amounts will be communicated to all NGOs&#13;
         active inDRC and key NGO networks abroad, for these groups to prepare and&#13;
         propose projects. These proposals will be evaluated against a set o f pre-agreed&#13;
        criteria to check their eligibility and rank proposed activities. Only the highest-&#13;
        ranked proposal for each beneficiary city will be financed under the Project.&#13;
&#13;
        An encouragement to graduallyphase out. After implementation o f the initial&#13;
         allocation, selection criteria for activities financed under a second allocation will&#13;
         include specific benchmarks to ensure a gradual transfer o f capacity, and&#13;
         involvement o f the local private sector (inparticular for design and supervision),&#13;
        as may be appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
85.     NGOs and other entities fundedunder the Project will be expected to be fully&#13;
responsible for the implementation o f the activities they have initiated, including&#13;
procurement and financial management - within the context of an operational manual&#13;
approved by IDA prior to effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
Eligible activities&#13;
&#13;
86.     For both large and smaller cities, eligibility criteria will be specified inan&#13;
operational manual to be prepared by effectiveness. They will include standard eligibility&#13;
criteria under the EERP and additional criteria specified below:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               - 39-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Nature of the activities. No new construction - only rehabilitation -will be&#13;
         financed. Selected activities should yield benefits widely distributedwithin the&#13;
         community, and contribute to improving living conditions within the community.&#13;
         Activities that can be financed may include, but will not be limited to: social&#13;
         infrastructure (e.g., education, health, community centers), economic&#13;
         infrastructure (e.g., water, markets, slaughterhouses, transport, and energy),&#13;
         environmental and sanitation (e.g., rehabilitation o f sewage and drainage&#13;
         networks, public squares) and other labor-intensive rehabilitation projects with a&#13;
         positive impact on the community. Works, hrniture, equipment, materials and'&#13;
         the deliveryof services (such as training ofteachers or nurses, and campaigns to&#13;
         prevent the spread o f infectious diseases) can be financed -with no mandatory&#13;
         thresholds for community participation.&#13;
&#13;
         Commitment to operation and maintenance. Realistic and sustainable&#13;
         mechanisms for operation and maintenance (including financing) o f the&#13;
         rehabilitated infrastructure and facilities should be devised prior to the selection&#13;
         o f the activity, inorder to ensure sustainability. This should include clear&#13;
         financing plans, as well as the naming o f individuals incharge. Selected activities&#13;
         should yield benefits widely distributed within the community, and contribute to&#13;
         improving living conditions o f communities.&#13;
&#13;
         Expected labor content. For activities to be approved, wage costs should&#13;
         represent a large part o f the total cost o f the investment. The selection process&#13;
         will favor activities with the highest job created / US$invested ratio. Particular&#13;
         attention will be given to the share o f employment opportunities accessible to&#13;
         women.&#13;
&#13;
         Wage levels. Wage costs for unskilledlabor should be set at a level which: (i)s    i&#13;
         consistent with the subsistence needs o f the laborer and hisher immediate&#13;
         dependents; (ii)makes labor-intensive works competitive with equipment-&#13;
         intensive methods; (iii) not deter the development o f other productive&#13;
                                   does&#13;
         activities; and (iv) permits a self-selection o f the poorest.&#13;
&#13;
 87.     Insmaller cities, to be eligible, proposals submittedby NGOs should cost less&#13;
 than US$300,000 each, and it should be possible to complete them within 12 months after&#13;
 inception (keeping inmind seasonality constraints). Inlarge cities, there will be no&#13;
 ceiling for individual activities (up to the available allocation), but implementation period&#13;
 should be less than 18 months.&#13;

  COMPONENTCOMMUNITYEMPOWERMENT&#13;
                 5:&#13;
  Objectives&#13;
&#13;
  89.      This component aims to pilot a mechanism to support community development in&#13;
  those isolated rural areas where security conditions are adequate for development&#13;
  activities to be implemented. The component aims to focus on selected pilot areas and&#13;
  activate arrangements for transparent and effective implementationo f such activities. If&#13;
  successful, such arrangements could be gradually extended to cover other rural conflict-&#13;
 affected areas - and could also usedby other donors to channel their assistance to&#13;
  community development in such areas.&#13;
&#13;
  90.      Specific objectives include: (i)   to support participatory decision-making and the&#13;
  strengtheningo f social capital; (ii)to recapitalize village assets, to facilitate local&#13;
 recovery; (iii) to improve service delivery inpoor rural communities; and (iv) to inject&#13;
  liquidity ina cash-deprived rural economy and hence to contribute to restoring some&#13;
 purchasingpower and to reviving monetary transactions.&#13;
&#13;
 91.       Such support i s critical in a context where millions o f Congolese, who live in&#13;
. isolated rural communities, have been forced into autarky over the last years. Poverty in&#13;
 these areas i s particularly acute, and barter has often replaced monetary transactions. The&#13;
 erosion o f social capital i s contributing to the forming o f armed bands and the related&#13;
 spread o f insecurity throughout large areas. Support to these areas will help both mitigate&#13;
 the current humanitarian crisis andrestore stability and security inprovinces which have&#13;
 beendevastated by the conflict.&#13;

&#13;
Overalldescription&#13;
&#13;
92.     The component will finance o f a series o f block grants, which will be allocated&#13;
directly to isolated rural communities inpre-determined amounts and will be managed&#13;
through broad participatory processes. The Project will empower villagers to planfor,&#13;
and decide on (through a facilitated planning process), the investments to be made with&#13;
the proceeds of the grants, which could be usedfor a broadvariety o f activities including:&#13;
(i)small-scale infrastructurerepairs, (ii)  development o f community assets, (iii)  provision&#13;
o f agricultural inputs and tools, (iv) establishment o f revolving funds, (v) provision o f&#13;
social service, and (vi) purchase o f training or technical services.&#13;
&#13;
93.     The component will be implementedunderthe overall responsibility o f a&#13;
consulting firm (the Community Empowerment Management Firm), which will be hired&#13;
by the Government through a service contract (similarly to arrangements under&#13;
component 4). This entity will inturn enter into contractual agreements with NGOs&#13;
and/or UNagencies for the execution o f activities ineach pilot area (the District&#13;
ImplementationAgencies). It will provide initial and on-the-job training to the District&#13;
ImplementationAgencies (inparticular with regard to the facilitation o f participatory&#13;
processes), and supervise their activities. A strong information campaign will be&#13;
launched inparallel, to ensure the effective involvement o f communities inthe&#13;
monitoring o f activities at their level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Selection of beneficiarycommunities&#13;
&#13;
94.     To facilitate implementation and preventthe emergence o f tensions between&#13;
neighboring villages, entire districts will be selected inwhich all communities will be&#13;
eligible. The Project will be implemented infive areas (districts / parts o f districts /&#13;
groups of contiguous districts). The selection o f beneficiary areas was made by the&#13;
Government, in close consultation with local authorities and other stakeholders, on the&#13;
basis o f the following criteria:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Accessibility and security. Pilot districts will be selected inareas which are&#13;
        currently accessible. Security conditions inthese areas should be adequate for&#13;
        development activities to be implementedwithout putting project staff or&#13;
        contractors at undue risk, and for the expected benefits o f the activities to be&#13;
        sustainable. Disbursements will be limitedto areas with a story of continued&#13;
        stability over a year, and will be suspended incase o f renewed violence (this i s&#13;
        expected to provide incentives for peace and stability at local level).&#13;
&#13;
    0   Poverty. Districts / groups o f districts will be expected to be selected on the basis&#13;
        of criteria including poverty, population, and lack of alternative providers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Community organization. While entire districts / groups o f districts will be&#13;
        eligible, the District Implementation Agency will be authorized (after consultation&#13;
        with the Government and the Bank) to suspend assistance to selected&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             - 42 -&#13;
&#13;
         communities where organizational structures are deemed inadequate or&#13;
         dysfunctional.&#13;
&#13;
95.      The component i s expected to cover an estimated 800 communities in 6 areas. On&#13;
the basis o fthe above criteria, the following pilot areas have beenselected: districts o f&#13;
Buta(Province Orientale), Gemena (Equateur), Isiro (Province Orientale), Kibombo&#13;
(Maniema), Lodja (Kasai Oriental), and Masisi (North Kivu).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Implementationsteps&#13;
&#13;
96.      For each district, a District ImplementationAgency will be selected. This&#13;
selection will be made by the Community Empowerment Management Firm(after&#13;
consultation with the Government, local authorities, and stakeholders) on the basis of: (i)&#13;
the District Implementation Agency's knowledge of, and experience inthe area; (ii)       its&#13;
demonstrated ability to adequately transfer funds to communities; (iii)its capacity to&#13;
facilitate collective decision-making processes; and (iv) cost factors. The District&#13;
Implementation Agency will be responsible for facilitating the communities' decision-&#13;
makingprocess, transferring resources to the communities, assisting inprocurement and&#13;
financial management as may be needed, and supervising implementationo f&#13;
communities' activities.&#13;
&#13;
97.      For each community, the first stage will consist inselecting activities and sub-&#13;
projects to be financed with the block grant. The Executing Agency will carry out a&#13;
broad information campaign inpotential beneficiary villages. Sub-projects will then be&#13;
selected through a participatory planning process within each community - which will be&#13;
facilitated by the District ImplementationAgency. This process i s expected to be&#13;
completed within 2 to 4 months. This process may also be informed by technical inputs&#13;
provided by the Executing Agency or other entities (e.g., government agencies). In&#13;
parallel to the selection, each community will be expected to establish a committee to&#13;
oversee implementation. The District Implementation Agency will pay particular&#13;
attention to ensuring adequate representation o f all relevant stakeholders inthis&#13;
committee (and inparticular women) and to facilitating transparency through a full&#13;
disclosure o f all financial information to the entire community.&#13;
&#13;
98.      Grant amounts will range from US$2,000 to US$5,000'per community, depending&#13;
on the population (these amounts will also be reviewed and adjusted during&#13;
implementation as necessary). Communities will be divided into three populationbands,&#13;
and grant sizes will be adjusted to each band. Except for a short negative list o f items&#13;
and sectors prohibited by IDA policies, grant options will be kept open. Communities&#13;
will be expected to contribute but no mandatory thresholds will be established. Inview&#13;
o f the level o f poverty inmany communities, and of the history o f forced labor inmany&#13;
areas, attention will be paid to ensuringthat community participation is o f a voluntary&#13;
nature and that those involved draw a benefit from their participation. Experience&#13;
elsewhere has shown that block grants (hard budget constraints) allow for better&#13;
optimization o f local participation, particularly in areas with highly unequal abilities to&#13;
contribute, such as post-conflict zones. Communities will be encouraged to obtain&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             - 43 -&#13;
&#13;
complementary support from other entities such as private providers, NGOs, UN&#13;
Agencies, and government technical agencies.&#13;
&#13;
99.      Communities will be responsible for the implementation o f the activities they&#13;
have selected, with the support o f the District ImplementationAgency. The community&#13;
may decide to execute the activity on its own by employing labor and by procuringthe&#13;
neededmaterials directly or to awardthe whole or part ofwork to private sector entities,&#13;
community organizations, or NGOs. The community will inany event be responsible for&#13;
procurement and financial management - within the context o f an operational manual to&#13;
be prepared by the Government and approved by IDA prior to the start o f activities under&#13;
the Project. The District ImplementationAgency will help communities to monitor&#13;
contractors' performance as may be necessary to ensure best possible quality.&#13;
&#13;
100.     The block grant to a given community will be disbursedin several tranches,&#13;
following a schedule agreed uponbetweeneach community and the District&#13;
ImplementationAgency. The first tranche, will be paid at inception, and subsequent&#13;
tranches will be paid after the implementing agency has verified the effective use o f&#13;
earlier tranches (e.g., the actual completion o f a pre-agreed part o f the works, the&#13;
effective purchase o f pre-agreed inputs or equipment).&#13;
&#13;
101.     Success will depend on the existence o f an efficient, reliable and fast system for&#13;
local-level disbursements. The District Implementation Agencies will use existing&#13;
payment systems as much as possible to ensure a smooth transfer o f funds. Still, due to&#13;
reasons related to security, damaged infrastructure, and a breakdown in communications,&#13;
they may face difficulties ineffecting timely payments in some areas - and they will be&#13;
encouraged to make payments to communities directly from central locations inthe&#13;
various provinces. Incase exceptional arrangements have to be made for payments in&#13;
remote locations, including the use o f alternative payment systems, the implementation&#13;
mechanismsand risk mitigation measures will have to be agreed upon with IDA prior to&#13;
the processing o f suchpayments.&#13;
&#13;
102.    Upon satisfactory completion o f the subproject, communities will be eligible for a&#13;
second grant, o f a double amount - and eventually for a third grant o f the same (doubled)&#13;
amount, provided activities can be completed within the period foreseen for&#13;
implementation o f the Project. Ina subsequentphase, it is expected that support would&#13;
gradually be adjusted with a view to: (i)reducing grant sizes to a sustainable level (to be&#13;
determinedthrough ajoint review with the Government) as communities mature and their&#13;
most immediate needs are met; (ii)   strengtheningmechanisms for inter-village&#13;
coordination; (iii)linking community-level support to the overall efforts aimed at&#13;
revitalizing public institutions and fostering effective local governance; and (iv)&#13;
improving poverty targeting and better reflecting population weightings as more&#13;
information on populations and living conditions becomes available.&#13;
&#13;
103.    Throughout the life o f the Project, the District Implementation Agency's&#13;
facilitation and supervision teams will be expected to take advantage o f each of their&#13;
visits to the beneficiary communities to conduct simple HIV/AIDS awareness training.&#13;

Cost breakdown&#13;
&#13;
104.   A detailed cost breakdown (inUS$ million) for the component is provided below.&#13;
As insimilar projects inother countries, implementation costs are expected to be&#13;
relatively high, at about 25 percent o fthe total amount, due to highstartup costs (which&#13;
include several large one-time charges such as establishing provincial offices, vehicle and&#13;
computer purchases), and access difficulties.&#13;

PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION          PERIOD&#13;
&#13;
105.    The Project is expected to be fully implemented withinfour and a half years o f&#13;
effectiveness (Le. by March 31,2008).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION       ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Overallimplementationarrangements&#13;
&#13;
106.    Capacity o f the Government and o f local administrative authorities to execute the&#13;
Project in accordance with Bank procedures remains compromised. Given the&#13;
emergency nature and the complexity o f the Project, ad hoc implementationmechanisms&#13;
will be set up, inorder to ensure: (i) disbursementunder an emergency program; (ii)&#13;
                                       fast&#13;
the reaching o fmulti-sectoral objectives, and (iii) transparency. Taking a pragmatic&#13;
approach, and cognizant o f the existing limitations, the design of implementation&#13;
arrangements reflects the experience acquired inimplementingthe EERP and the EMRR&#13;
Project - and i s based on a delegation o f implementation responsibilities as large as&#13;
possible and a maximum use o f existing implementation structures (with attention not to&#13;
overburdeningthem).&#13;
&#13;
107.    Three main entities will be involved in overall implementationo f the Project:&#13;
&#13;
        A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) which i s to be established inthe Ministry o f&#13;
        Plan by effectiveness. The PCU will be the Bank's maincounterpart and focal&#13;
        point. It will be responsible for: (i)overall oversight o f implementation; (ii)&#13;
        implementation o f specific activities as described below; (iii)coordination of, and&#13;
        with technical ministriesand other relevant entities for successful implementation&#13;
        o f all components; and (iv) coordination with the Bank. The PCU i s expected to&#13;
        be a relatively light unit, with few specialized staff, which relies heavily on sub-&#13;
        contracting implementation to other entities.&#13;
&#13;
    0   A High-Level Oversight Committee, to oversee the PCU. The committee will&#13;
        include the Ministers o f Finance, Budget, Plan, and Public Works and the&#13;
        Economic Adviser to the President, or their representatives. It will be chaired by&#13;
        the Minister ofPlan or hisrepresentative. Itwill review the PCU's activities to&#13;
        strengthen transparency and help ensure a fair distribution o f activities throughout&#13;
        the country (as foreseen under the Project). The Government has committed to&#13;
        establish this Committee within three months after effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
   e    The Bureau Central de Coordination (BCECO) to act as a procurement agent for&#13;
        all contracts to be awarded directly by the Government under the Project (terms o f&#13;
        reference and specifications will be provided by the PCU; contracts will be signed&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            -46-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         by the PCU and the relevant Ministry; and follow up will be under the PCU's&#13;
         responsibility). BCECO i s an independent institution which is successfully&#13;
         managing rehabilitation projects andinstitutional strengthening programs under&#13;
         the EERP andEMRRP. BCECO has substantialexperience infinancial&#13;
         management andprocurement (as per procedurespreparedwith Bank assistance&#13;
         and up to international standards) and has received foreign technical assistance in&#13;
         project management, procurement, and financial management. BCECO will&#13;
         benefit from targeted support under the Project to strengthenits capacities(in&#13;
         terms of staffing) and ensure it can effectively perform its functions.&#13;
&#13;
Component 1: Balanceof paymentssupport&#13;
&#13;
108.     Implementation of reforms supported under this component will be coordinated&#13;
by the Ministry of Finance. The Central Bank will ensure that funds are adequately&#13;
disbursedfor the procurement of eligible imports.&#13;
&#13;
Component2: Institutionalstrengthening&#13;
&#13;
109.     This component will be implemented by the PCU with support from BCECO for&#13;
procurement. The PCU will coordinate work by technical ministries and other relevant&#13;
institutions to prepareterms of reference and other specifications. The PCUwill present&#13;
the activities to be financed under the component to the Bank inthe form of a semi-&#13;
annual documented procurement plan. Once provided with a no-objection by the Bank,&#13;
the PCUwill transmitthe procurement planto BCECO, for BCECO to prepare and&#13;
manage the procurement process. Supervision of implementation of the consultancy&#13;
assignment or installation of equipment will be under the responsibility o f each&#13;
beneficiary institution, under the overall oversight of the PCU.&#13;
&#13;
110.     This procedureis expected to help meet the double criteria oftransparency and&#13;
effectiveness, inthe context of a complex reunification process. It will also help ensure&#13;
full consistency betweenthe activities financed underthe Component, other capacity&#13;
building activities financed under the EERP and EMRRProject (and implemented by&#13;
BCECO), and the overall Government economic program supported by the Bretton&#13;
Woods Institutions.&#13;
&#13;
Component3: Infrastructure rehabilitation&#13;
&#13;
111.     Implementation arrangements will be designedon the basis of experience under&#13;
the EERP and EMRRProject, ina context of weakened Congolese institutions (the&#13;
``Ofice des Routes", which is nominally responsible for programming and supervising&#13;
construction and maintenanceworks has lost capacity during the conflict, inparticular in&#13;
reunifiedprovinces, and is no longer inapositionto rapidly execute works of the scope&#13;
and nature considered under the Project). Underthese projects, ad hoc implementation&#13;
mechanismswere developed to ensure effectiveness and transparency -namely the&#13;
BCECO for the EERP and the Project Management and Implementation Firm(PMIF),&#13;
for the EMRR Project. These mechanisms are provingadequate, and important lessons&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                           -47-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
havebeenlearnedinthe process. Still, these entitiesare currently fblly employed, and&#13;
are not inapositionto manage substantialadditionalworks.&#13;
&#13;
112.    Building onthis experience, activitiesfinancedunderthis componentwill hence&#13;
be executedas follows:&#13;
&#13;
        For R N4, throughthe PCU, which will awardtwo sets of contracts (for works /&#13;
        maintenanceand design/ supervision,for teams startingworks from Kisangani&#13;
        and Beni respectively)onthe basis of a procurementprocessmanagedby            I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        BCECO;&#13;
&#13;
        For RN2, throughthe PCU, which will issue two sets of contracts (for works /&#13;
        maintenanceand design/ supervision, for teams startingworks from Mbuji-Mayi&#13;
        and Bukavurespectively) on the basis of a procurementprocessmanaged by&#13;
        BCECO;&#13;
&#13;
        For RN 1, through BCECO (since it is a continuationof activities already&#13;
        managed by BCECO), which will issue two contracts (for works and supervision).&#13;
&#13;
113.    The PCU(for RN4 and RN2) and BCECO (for RN 1) will be fully responsible&#13;
for planningactivities, and monitoring, and supervisingcontracts on behalfo f the&#13;
Government, in accordancewith Bank procurement,financial managementand&#13;
disbursement guidelines. For RN4, RN2, and RN 1, BCECO will be responsiblefor&#13;
preparingtenders and carrying out procurement evaluations. Both entities will work&#13;
closely with the ministries and relevant institutions(suchas the Office des Routes), both&#13;
to benefit from their expertiseand to assist them inbuilding capacity for managingand&#13;
implementingfuture developmentprojects.&#13;
&#13;
Component4: Urban rehabilitation&#13;
&#13;
114.    Implementationis expectedto be particularlydifficult, since the componentwill&#13;
includeactivities in a large number o f urbancenters- ina post-conflictcontext,&#13;
characterizedby a high degree o fpolitical fragmentation, difficulties of access, a history&#13;
of widespread corruption, and a compromisedadministrativecapacity. Still, some&#13;
experiencehas been accumulatedinimplementingactivitiessuch as those foreseenunder&#13;
this component, and implementationarrangementswill reflect lessons learnedin&#13;
implementingthe EERP and the EMRR Project.&#13;
&#13;
115.   The Component will be implementedby the PCU, through an overallservice&#13;
contract with a consultinggroup (the UrbanRehabilitationManagementFirm), which&#13;
will be responsible for overall implementationofthe componentandreportingto the&#13;
PCU.&#13;
&#13;
    0  For largecities, the UrbanRehabilitationManagementFirm will inturn enter into&#13;
       contracts with private enterprises or NGOs for both works and supervision. It will&#13;
       be responsiblefor planningactivities, preparingtenders, carryingout evaluations,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            - 48 -&#13;
&#13;
        and monitoring, and supervisingcontracts on behalfofthe Government, in&#13;
        accordancewith Bankprocurement, financial management and disbursement&#13;
        guidelines. Itwill be expectedto work closely with local authoritiesandrelevant&#13;
        technical entities, bothto benefitfrom their expertiseand to assist them in&#13;
        building capacity for managingand implementingfuture developmentprojects.&#13;
&#13;
        For smaller cities, the UrbanRehabilitationManagementFirmwill enter into&#13;
        subsidiary service agreements with qualifiedNGOs. It will be responsiblefor&#13;
        planningactivities, preparingand managingthe competitive processthrough&#13;
                                                                                          ~&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
        behalfof the Government, inaccordance with Bankprocurement, financial&#13;
        management and disbursementguidelines. It will be expectedto work closely&#13;
        with local authorities, bothto benefit from their expertiseand to monitor&#13;
        implementation. The NGOswill beresponsible for procurementand financial&#13;
        management under their contract and will also be expectedto work closely with&#13;
        local authoritiesto assist them in buildingcapacity for managingand&#13;
        implementingfuture developmentprojects.&#13;
&#13;
Component 5: Community empowerment&#13;
&#13;
 116.   Implementationof this component is also expectedto be challenging due to the&#13;
geographicalextensionof activities financedunder the componentand difficulties of&#13;
access. Inaddition, communities in many parts o f DRC have been subject to a broad&#13;
range of crises over the past decade that have underminedtheir ability to act as groups.&#13;
Experiencein DRC shows that these difficulties can be overcome, providedthat&#13;
implementationmechanismsare well designedto make best use of existing capacity, and&#13;
put in place ring-fencedprocesses and procedures-and if an adequate level of support&#13;
and oversight is beingprovidedby Bank staff throughout the implementationperiod.&#13;
&#13;
117.    The componentwill be implementedby the PCU, through an overall service&#13;
contract with a consultinggroup (the Community EmpowermentManagementFirm),&#13;
which will be responsiblefor: (i) providing initial and on-the-jobtraining to the District&#13;
ImplementationAgencies (inparticularwith retardto the facilitation of participatory&#13;
processes); (ii) supervisingtheir activities; and (iii) reportingregularly to the PCU.&#13;
&#13;
118.    Activities ineach pilot area will be managed by the District Implementation&#13;
Agencies under a service contract with the Community EmpowermentManagement&#13;
Firm. The District ImplementationAgencies are expectedto be selected within three&#13;
monthsafter effectiveness and will be responsiblefor: (i)disseminatinginformation&#13;
about the Componentto all pilot communities; (ii) facilitating a participatoryprocess for&#13;
communities to plan and implement activities; (iii) screening(technically and financially)&#13;
proposalsmade by communities; (iv) disbursingfunds to the communitiesfor the&#13;
implementationof selectedactivities, as per a pre-agreedschedule; (v) monitoringthe&#13;
effectiveuse of resources, inparticularwith a view to ensuringtransparency and&#13;
effectivenessinmattersof procurementand financial management; and (vi) reportingon&#13;

&#13;
   Operationalmanual&#13;
&#13;
   119.    The PCUwill prepare by effectivenessan operationalmanualfor the Project,&#13;
   which is expectedto include: (i) a descriptionof the relationshipbetweenthe various&#13;
   actors involvedinimplementation; (ii)detaileddescriptiono f procurementand&#13;

   specific arrangementsfor key activities under components4 and 5 (e.g., processfor   '&#13;
&#13;
   selection of NGOsunder component 4, standarddesigns for basic activities under&#13;
   component 5). To ensure transparency, copies of the operationalmanualwill be broadly&#13;
   disseminatedand discussedwith each beneficiary entity and community.&#13;
&#13;
   Reviews&#13;
&#13;
   120.    Within the context o fregular implementationsupport missions, implementation&#13;
   mechanismsand the operationalmanualwill be reviewedby IDA on a semiannualbasis.&#13;
   Limited adjustmentswill be made as necessary, to better reflect andtake into accountthe&#13;
   situationon the ground and the experienceacquiredduringeach phase o f&#13;
   implementation. This, however, is not expectedto include changes inthe procurement&#13;
   and financial managementarrangementsdescribedinthis document.&#13;

&#13;
   Basic principles&#13;
&#13;
   121.    The Projectwill finance works, goods, services, imports, small grants, and&#13;
   operatingcosts. Procurementwill be conductedinaccordance with IDA guidelinesas&#13;
   per "Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", dated January 1995 (revisedin&#13;
   January 1996,August 1996, September 1997,and January 1999), "Selection and&#13;
   Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers", dated January 1997 (revisedin&#13;
   September 1997,January 1999,and May 2002), and "Guidelinesfor Simplified&#13;
   Procurement and Disbursementfor Community-based Investments", dated February&#13;
   1998. Procurementmethodsto be usedunder the Projectwill build on experienceto date&#13;

&#13;
  123.   The PCUwill delegate procurement responsibility to specializedentitiesas&#13;
  described above - and will not be directly involvedin procurement. The tasks of the&#13;
  executing entities will comprise:(i) maintainingregistersof all interestedbidders; (ii)&#13;
  maintaininga detailed list of technical specificationsof goods and servicesto be financed&#13;
  by the project; (iii) preparingand updatingprocurementplans and calendars; (iv)&#13;

  directly awardedby the Government(which will be procuredby BCECO). The&#13;
  internationalprocurement advisor to the Minister o f Financewill assist the PCUandthe&#13;
  executingentities when warranted- inparticularto ensure internal technical review of&#13;
  the documentationand proposalof contract awards by BCECO. The PCUwill submit to&#13;
  the Ministry of Financeand to the Bank quarterly reports(including activitiesunder all&#13;
&#13;

  remainingactivities.&#13;
&#13;
  124.   Overall, the PCUis expectedto sign and BCECO to procurea total of 12&#13;
  contracts for components 3,4, and 5 - including 10contracts (5 contracts of works and 5&#13;
  contracts o f supervision) under component 3, and a single contract under component4&#13;

 Community EmpowermentManagementFirmrespectively). The PCUandBCECOare&#13;
 expectedto also signand procureanumber of additionalcontractsunder Component2.&#13;
&#13;
 Procurementmethods&#13;
&#13;
 125. Procurementmethodsare describedinAppendix D. They will rely on&#13;
 competitive process-namely InternationalCompetitive Bidding(ICB), National&#13;
 CompetitiveBidding (NCB), National Shopping(NS), and quotationsmethodsfor goods&#13;
 and services,Quality-CostBased Selection (QCBS) and Consultant's Qualification(CQ)&#13;
 for consultants and service agreements. Sole source contractingwill be usedina limited&#13;
 number of specific cases, as specifiedinAppendix D. IDA will conduct prior reviews&#13;
 and post reviews as describedinAppendix D.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 DISBURSEMENTARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
 126. The IDA Credit and IDA Grant will finance 100percent of all expenditures, net&#13;
 of taxes and duties. The disbursementschedule is expectedto be as follows: 25 percent&#13;
 inFY04, 7 percent inFY05, 22 percent inFY06,24 percentinFY07, and 22 percentin&#13;
 FY08.&#13;
&#13;
 Component 1 (Balance of payments support)&#13;
&#13;
 127.    Uponapproval of the Project,the Ministry of Financewill open a Special Deposit&#13;
 Account at the Central Bank in which IDA will deposit the proceeds o f the Credit under&#13;
 component 1. The Ministry of Finance is expectedto set up accountingand tracking&#13;
 arrangements similar to those which were found satisfactoryfor implementationof the&#13;
 US$450 million ERC, to ensure that resources from the Credit are committedand&#13;
 expended inaccordancewith the provisions of the Credit. The use of the funds deposited&#13;
 by the Bank inthe deposit account will be subject to annual audits by auditors based on&#13;
 terms o f referenceacceptable to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
 Components 2 (Institutiona1strengthening) and 3 (Infrastructure rehabilitation)&#13;
&#13;
 128.    To facilitate implementationand reduce the volume of withdrawal applications, a&#13;
 SpecialAccount will be openedinUS dollars ina commercialbank on terms and&#13;
 conditionsacceptable to IDA. The SpecialAccount will be managedby the PCUand&#13;
 will finance all eligible expendituresunder components2 and 3 (except for the large&#13;
.workscontractorswill&#13;
        contracts under this component). For the largeworks contracts under component&#13;
 3, the                  submit their invoicesto the PCU, who will fonvardthem to the&#13;
 Bankwithin ten working days for direct payment.&#13;
&#13;
 129.    For the SpecialAccount, the authorizedallocation will be US$2 million&#13;
 correspondingto about four monthsof eligible expenditures. Whenconditions for&#13;
 disbursement for the relevantcomponentare met, IDA will make an initial deposit, inthe&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                - 5 2 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   amount o f US$lmillion into the Special Account, representing fifty percent ofthe&#13;
   authorized allocations. The remaining balance will be made available when the&#13;
   aggregate amount o f withdrawals from the credivgrant account plus the total amount of&#13;
   all outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association shall be equal or&#13;
   exceed the equivalent o f US$5.5 million. Inview o f the expected small size of the&#13;
   contracts, it is expected that a very large majority o fpayments will be processed through&#13;
   the Special Accounts. Furtherdeposits by IDA into the Special Accounts will be made&#13;
   against monthly withdrawal applications supported by appropriate documents.&#13;
   Withdrawal applications will be signed by authorized representatives of the Borrower, as&#13;
   designated by the Minister o f Finance, which are expected to be the PCU Director and the&#13;
   Ministero fFinance.&#13;
&#13;
   Components4 (Urban rehabilitation) and 5 (Community empowerment)&#13;
&#13;
   130.    Payment conditions for the Urban Rehabilitation Management Firm under&#13;
   component 4 and the Community Empowerment ManagementFirmunder component 5&#13;
   will be specified inthe service agreements betweenthe PCU and these entities. These&#13;
   entities will be expected to submit an invoice on a quarterly basis to the Government.&#13;
   The invoices will distinguish between the management fee for the Components&#13;
   (calculated on the basis o f specifications inthe service agreements) and the finds&#13;
   released to finance the implementation o f local projects (supported by an exhaustive list&#13;
   and cost details o f activities, and based on payment modalities contained in the&#13;
   respective service agreements). Upon receipt of these invoices, the PCU will forward&#13;
   them to the Bank within ten working days for payment.&#13;
&#13;

141.    The Bank will devote some 30 staff weeks per year and a total o f 125 staff weeks&#13;
through FY08 to help the Government in implementingthe Project and supervise&#13;

involvement by the Kinshasa Country Office, will inparticular focus on performance o f&#13;
the executing entities in managing contracts, procurement, and financial matters, as well&#13;
as in completing the agreed implementation plans. Duringsupervision Bank staff will&#13;
pay special attention to the following:&#13;
&#13;
        For component 1, to the implementation o f adequate tracking arrangements to&#13;
        monitor the use o f funds, which should take place as per accepted budgetary&#13;
        procedures;&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
142.    Regular reviews will be carried out every 6 months after effectiveness to assess&#13;
progress, achievement o f overall objectives, and the respective roles o f the different&#13;
partners and to reorient the Project ifneededto ensure achievement of objectives. The&#13;
reviews will involve visits by specialists to selected sites for first-handassessment o f&#13;
executing entities' performance. The PCUwill be responsible for: (i)preparing the&#13;
necessary documentation for the reviews, and (ii)planning the review meeting. In&#13;
particular, the PCU will contract a consultant (under project finance) to review and assess&#13;
the progress of implementationand prepare the necessary documentation for the periodic&#13;
reviews. The PCU will also organize meetings with implementingpartners (e.g., NGOs)&#13;
and key stakeholders and direct beneficiaries, for the supervision mission to receive&#13;
direct feedback from all relevant parties.&#13;

ESVIRONMENTAL        ASPECTS AND COMPLIANCE WITH BANKSAFEGUARD POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
143.    The Project is classified as environmental category B because no activity funded&#13;
under the Project is expected to have a significant negative environmental or social&#13;
impact (the EEW and EMRRP which included similar infrastructure rehabilitation&#13;
activities received a similar classification). It should be noted that the emergency was in&#13;
no way related to inappropriate environmental management practices. Special steps will&#13;
be taken for specific components:&#13;
&#13;
        For component 3, the rehabilitation works are expected to trigger several&#13;
        Safeguard Policies (namely on forestry, natural habitats, and involuntary&#13;
        resettlement), although their impact can be mitigated. It should be noted that&#13;
        works will focus on rehabilitation o f an existing infrastructure (no new&#13;
        construction), and that there will be no change inthe horizontal alignment or&#13;
        cross-section o f the highways. Contracts will include clauses on restoration of the&#13;
        borrowing pits opened for the works as well as on environmental protection at the&#13;
        contractors base camps (e.g., waste products from vehicle maintenance, sanitation&#13;
        facilities). An Environmental and Social Assessment, financed under the Project,&#13;
        will be prepared, approved by the Bank and disclosed incountry and inthe&#13;
        Infoshop within one year o f effectiveness (as per OP8.50).&#13;

0 For components 4 and 5, the operational manual will include screening&#13;
  procedures, to ensure that no activity with a potential negative environmentalor&#13;
  social impact i s selected for financing, without appropriate mitigation measures.&#13;
  These procedures will be adjusted to reflect the findings andrecommendations of&#13;
  an Environmental and Social Management Framework and a Resettlement Policy&#13;
  Framework to be prepared, approved by the Bank and disclosed incountry and in&#13;

BENEFITS&#13;
&#13;
144.  The Project is expectedto provide four types ofmajor benefits, which are&#13;
expectedto contribute to a successfulprocessof economic andsocial reunificationin&#13;
DRC:&#13;
&#13;
      Supportphysical and institutional reunijication. The Project will inparticulaf:&#13;
&#13;
      (i)Facilitatethere-connectionof easternandwesternregionsthroughthe&#13;
      rehabilitation of major transport links (undercomponent 3). While it is difficult&#13;
      to quantify economic benefits deriving from these works insuch a disrupted&#13;
      environment, there are strong indications that the impact will be very significant,&#13;
      interms ofbotheconomic recovery andpoliticalstabilization.&#13;
&#13;
      (ii)Contribute to enhancing thefunctioning ofpublic institutions andto&#13;
      improvingservices delivery inreunifiedprovinces, through support to the re-&#13;
      unification (and decentralization as appropriate) of institutions which were split&#13;
      during the conflict (under component 2). This is also expectedto have a major&#13;
      impact on prospectsfor sustainable political and social stability.&#13;
&#13;
      Help ensure that the benefits of the recent economic reforms can beperceived&#13;
      throughout the country. The Project will help the Government maintain strong&#13;
      performance under the economic program supportedby the Bretton Woods&#13;
      Institutions:&#13;
&#13;
      (i)Byhelpingtodealwiththejscalshockassociatedwiththereunijkation&#13;
      process, through balance o f payments support inthe short-term (under component&#13;
      1) and assistanceto gradually raise revenuesto the level necessary for the&#13;
      Government to meet its minimalobligations (under component 2).&#13;
&#13;
      (ii)Bysupportingimplementationof keyreforms -includingintheforestry&#13;
      sectors - inreunified provinces. This is expected to translate inan improved and&#13;
      more transparent business environment which will facilitate the involvement of&#13;
      private sector inthe East and North of the country (as has already beenthe case in&#13;
      Government-controlled areas).&#13;
&#13;
  e   Help generate `&gt;peace dividends" and address a number of urgent needs. The&#13;
      Project will help not only to improve living conditions, but also to create hope and&#13;
      new dynamics inareas which have beenlong neglected, which is critical for the&#13;
      success o f the reunification process - by:&#13;
&#13;
      (i)Re-capitalizing urban and community assets (under components 4 and 5).&#13;
      Although it is premature to calculate economic and financial benefits for&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                      -60-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
individual investments insuch a disruptedenvironment, cost data reported by&#13;
NGOsworking inDRC suggest that the urbanrehabilitation andcommunity&#13;
investmentsproposed under the Project will have a highpositive return. This is&#13;
expected to contribute to preventing the further deterioration o f health and loss of&#13;
life o f people who have been going through terrible ordeals over the last years.&#13;
&#13;
(ii)Providing employment opportunities. Experience inother countries suggests&#13;
that some 20 percent o f funds under component 3 and 60-70 percent of funds&#13;
under components 4 and 5 returnto local labor (often very small community&#13;
businesses and poor laborers). Thus, approximately US$30-35 million will be .&#13;
given as direct wages to the rural poor. Incommunities which are almost&#13;
demonetized as a result o f the conflict, this i s expected to have a substantial&#13;
impact on local economic activity. It i s also expected to provide sustainable&#13;
reintegration opportunities to former combatants and other young, able-bodied&#13;
adults who could become a ferment o f insecurity and instability.&#13;
&#13;
(iii)Fostering and strengthening community organization in conflict-affected&#13;
areas - and making communities active players for their development. Activities&#13;
under component 5 are expected to encourage collective action incommunities, to&#13;
empower them to make decisions on matters which affect them, andto make them&#13;
active players intheir development. This is expected to facilitate the eventual&#13;
emergence o f new local leadership and governance structures, which i s key for&#13;
stability and reunification.&#13;
&#13;
Lay the groundfor a larger-scale assistanceprogramwithin the context of the&#13;
extension of the EMRRP, which remains key to provide a coherent priority&#13;
framework for donor support and maximize impact. The Project will in&#13;
particular:&#13;
&#13;
(i)Helptotackletheissueof implementation capacity,throughtheactivationof&#13;
effective and transparent implementation mechanisms which could easily be&#13;
expanded (under components 3,4, and 5). The design o f the Project allows for a&#13;
relatively simple expansion o f coverage for several components, as well as for the&#13;
involvement o f other donors through co-financing arrangements (with sufficient&#13;
flexibility in implementation arrangements for donors to follow their own&#13;
procedures without adding a burdenon Congolese entities).&#13;
&#13;
(ii)Generatinginformationforfollow-on programs. Managementandeconomic&#13;
information gathered duringthe implementationperiod will be critical for&#13;
preparing follow-on programs aimed at supporting war-affected communities.&#13;
This information will also be key for the preparation o fthe PRSP, while the links&#13;
developed with specific communities through implementing o f the Project will&#13;
facilitate their actual participation inthe process.&#13;
&#13;
(iii)Financing engineering studies and other preparatory activities (under&#13;
component 2) for the extension o f the EMRRP.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              - 61 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
145.    The proposed Project i s a high-risk,high-gain enterprise. Research and&#13;
experience show that external assistance can play a key role inconsolidating fragile post-&#13;
conflict situations and facilitating economic recovery. The risks o f engagement have&#13;
hence to be balanced with the risks o f inaction, which are considerable. The approach&#13;
suggested here consists inadopting a pro-active risk mitigation strategy rather than a risk&#13;
avoidance approach -that i s to identify key factors o f risks and designways to minimize&#13;
their potential impact.&#13;
&#13;
146.   Through consultations with both other donors and Congolese stakeholders, Bank&#13;
staff have identified five maintypes o f risks, each o f which could seriously jeopardize the&#13;
implementation o f the Project or the successful achievements o f its objectives:&#13;
&#13;
        The risk that thepoliticalprocess of reunification stalls, with a significant&#13;
       impact on security conditions, inparticular inreunified provinces, and eventually&#13;
       on political stability. This would jeopardize the achievements o f the Project's&#13;
       major objective - although it may not annul some o f the Project's expected&#13;
       positive outcomes (e.g., rehabilitation o f local infrastructure). This risk has,&#13;
       however, beendiminishing over the last two years&#13;
&#13;
       The Project is precisely aimed at mitigating this risk. Still, the Bank will carefidly&#13;
       monitor political developments inthe DRC and its neighbors, with a view to&#13;
       scaling back, suspending programs, or shifting focus elsewhere if conflict&#13;
       threatens the achievement o f objectives.&#13;
&#13;
        The risks associated with thefragility of the security situation in many eastern&#13;
       and northeastern areas. Some Project areas may be affected by renewed&#13;
       insecurity during implementation. Inparticular, works on RN4 will be carried&#13;
       out ina region which has gone through periods o f extreme violence, and at times&#13;
       inareas with a history of complete isolation over the last years. Insuch a context,&#13;
       there is a risk o f isolated incidents, involving either local populations or armed&#13;
       groups.&#13;
&#13;
       The Government and other relevant authorities have agreed to provide guarantees&#13;
       for the safety o f workers and equipment, and to take appropriate measures to that&#13;
       effect. Incase of security incidents, the Bank or the Government could decide to&#13;
       suspend execution of, or cancel part or the whole of specific contracts (with&#13;
       adequate compensation to the relevant contractors). It should be noted that the&#13;
       flow o f financial resources to urbanand rural communities is expected to also&#13;
       contribute to mitigatingthis risk by providing employment opportunities invery&#13;
       poor areas and demonstrating the benefits o f peace.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   The risks resultingfrom the current lack of administrative capacity in&#13;
       particular in reunified provinces. Despite its impressive track record o f&#13;
       economic reforms over the last two years, the Government still has a relatively&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                        - 62-&#13;
&#13;
  weak institutional and administrative capacity, which could lead to delays during&#13;
  implementation. The situation is worse inreunified provinces. Attention to other&#13;
  matters such as political reconciliation and security could also cause delays, in&#13;
  particular within the context o f a Government o fnational union, which, at least&#13;
  initially, may lack cohesion. Finally, there i s a risk that activities under the&#13;
  Project be instrumentalizedin support of specific political objectives.&#13;
&#13;
  To reduce demands on institutional capacity, and minimize these risks,&#13;
  implementation will largely rest on ad hoc arrangements based on service&#13;
  contracts with independententities. The inter-ministerial committee charged with&#13;
  implementingprograms supported by the BrettonWoods Institutions will have a&#13;
  key role to play to ensure the success of the process o f economic and social&#13;
  reunification. The Project also includes funds for the employment o f international&#13;
  experts with experience inpreparingand implementingdonor-funded projects,&#13;
  and inaccounting and financial management to help accelerate implementation.&#13;
  Additional needs for technical support, ifany, will be identified by regular&#13;
  implementation support missions, and may be funded under component 2 andor&#13;
  by other donors.&#13;
&#13;
  The risks resultingfrom the absence of afunctioning marketfor many goods&#13;
  and services in some reunifiedprovinces. Access to many areas, including large&#13;
  cities (e.g., Kisangani) remains difficult, and most goods are brought inby plane,&#13;
  while a small number of suppliers seem to enjoy monopolistic positions. This&#13;
  translates into a steep rise o f prices for materials essential for rehabilitation or&#13;
  income-generating activities. Inaddition, inmany areas, most contractors have&#13;
  lost equipment and staff, and have not beenactive for several years. This may&#13;
  substantially reduce the number o f potential contractors in some areas, and result&#13;
  ininadequate competition and highprices. Inthe absenceo fcomparable&#13;
  contracts awarded over the last years, there i s also no established market price for&#13;
  many activities to be financed under the Project - and hence estimates may need&#13;
  substantial adjustments.&#13;
&#13;
  The recent re-openingo fthe Congo River to commercial traffic is expected to&#13;
  mitigate this risk in some key areas (like Kisangani). Wherever possible and&#13;
  appropriate (inparticular under components 4 and 9,the Project will encourage&#13;
  the breaking down of activities into multiple small contracts, to maximize the&#13;
  number o f potential contractors and through repeated bidding process facilitate&#13;
  the emergence o f a market price. The Project will also allow for low thresholds&#13;
  for open competitive procedures to limit the impact o f local monopolies. Ifprices&#13;
  insome areas were substantially higher than those usually charged inthe region,&#13;
  the Bank could decide not to finance the corresponding contracts and to reallocate&#13;
 the resources to other activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0 Fiduciary risks. Fiduciary risks are significant, although experience with earlier&#13;
  projects indicates that the Government i s committed to ensuringa proper use o f&#13;
  funds.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              - 63 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        The establishment o f a proper system for allocating andtracking resources&#13;
        provided under component 1will be an important step towards ensuring proper&#13;
        control. The use o f an experienced entity, BCECO (which i s regularly audited,&#13;
        with unqualified audits), for procurement under components 2,3,4, and 5, ando f&#13;
        specific entities to organize and coordinate implementation under components 4&#13;
        and 5, are expected to reduce transparency risks. Information campaigns will also&#13;
        be organized for components 4 and 5 to facilitate the involvement o f communities&#13;
        inthe monitoring o f activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
EXITSTRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
147.    The proposed contingency response to a possible deterioration o f the political and&#13;
security situation consists inan incremental and targeted scaling down. Experience&#13;
shows, however, that while the security o f staff and contractors needs to be preserved,&#13;
suspendingoperations over a long period o ftime and canceling contracts makes it&#13;
difficult to provide the type o f rapid support which is needed when the situation&#13;
improves. While the resumptiono f a full-scale, and lengthy war could lead the Bank to&#13;
consider withdrawing from some parts or the whole o f DRC, the primary response to a&#13;
deterioration o f the security or political situation will consist inscaling down activities,&#13;
rather than suspendingthem.&#13;
&#13;
148.    The Bank will work inclose coordination with UNagencies and key bilaterals to&#13;
monitor political and security developments, so as to rapidly respond to unfolding events.&#13;
The response will be based on a dual assessment - o f staff security and o f the probability&#13;
for specific activities to be successfully implemented. Practical steps will include&#13;
revisions o f implementation schedule, revision o f the scope o f interventions, and possibly&#13;
partial suspension o f activities.&#13;

  Advertising&#13;
&#13;
  166.    Since a large portion of the Credit funds will be usedfor technical assistanceand&#13;
  consulting assignments, early attention will be given to advance planning of recruitment&#13;
  and timely search for expressions of interest through international advertising to obtain&#13;
  the best possible pool of candidatesfrom which strong short lists canbe compiled. A&#13;
  generalprocurement notice (GPN) will be prepared and issueduponBoard Approval in&#13;
  the United Nations Development Business. It will be updatedannually for any&#13;
  outstandingmajor procurement. Specific ProcurementNotices (SPN) for works to be&#13;
  procured through ICB will be advertised inthe national press of wide distribution and&#13;
  internationally. The related bidding documents, as applicable, will not be released-or&#13;
  the short list for consultant services will not beprepared-before eight weeks after the&#13;
  GPN has beenpublished. Expressions of interest for contractsto be procured underNCB&#13;
 will be advertisedinat least three national newspapers of wide circulation and sufficient&#13;
. time will be allowed to obtain bid documents andto preparebids.&#13;

 IDA Review&#13;
&#13;
 167.    Draft standard biddingdocuments for N C B will be reviewedand agreed upon&#13;
 with IDA withinthe context ofthe finalization o fthe Operational Manual, to be&#13;
 submittedas a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
 168.    Prior Review. All ICB and all direct contracts for works and goods will be&#13;
 subject to IDA'sprior review, inaccordance with paragraph 2, Appendix 1o f the&#13;
 guidelines. Inaddition, the following contracts will be subject to IDA'sprior review:&#13;
&#13;
    0   For component 2: the first three contracts under each procurement method;&#13;
&#13;
        For component 3: all contracts;&#13;
&#13;
        For component 4: the contract betweenthe PCU and the Urban Rehabilitation&#13;
         Management Firm, the contracts between the Urban RehabilitationManagement&#13;
         Firmandthe NGOs (for smaller cities), and the first three contracts awarded by&#13;
         the Urban Rehabilitation Management Firm for large cities under each&#13;

&#13;
 169.    Post review. IDA will also review 15 percent of the total number o f contracts&#13;
 through post-review. Inthe event samples o f post reviews indicate major problems,&#13;
 additional reviews, financed by the Borrower, should cover the remaining portion of&#13;
 contracts. The use o f IDA's standard bidding documents will considerably expedite the&#13;
 prior review process as IDA review will primarily focus on invitations to bid, bid data&#13;
 sheets, contract data, technical specifications, bill o f quantitiedschedule o f requirement&#13;
 and other contract specific items. The implementation agencies will be requiredto&#13;
 maintain all relevant procurement documentation for subsequent review by IDA. The&#13;
 implementationagencies will submit to IDA periodic procurement schedules detailing&#13;
 each procurement package inprogress and completed as part o f the normal project&#13;
 reporting exercise.&#13;

            Congo, Democratic Republic of : Emergency
            Economic and Social Reunification Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Emergency Economic and Social
            Reunification Support Project aims to assist the Government
            in the process of reunification, and contribute to the
            stabilization of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It
            comprises five components: The first two are aimed at
            supporting implementation of economic reforms throughout the
            country - a balance of payments support component, and an
            institutional strengthening component; these components are
            expected to be complementary of each other, and implemented
            in close coordination with other activities aimed at
            supporting the country-wide economic reform process; the
            next three components are aimed at both addressing urgent
            needs, and activating implementation mechanisms in reunified
            provinces - as a first step to prepare for the eventual
            extension of the Emergency Multi-Sector Rehabilitation and
            Reconstruction Program (EMRRP). These components will aim at
            meeting a large variety of needs, and will in particular,
            distinguish between three different types of activities: a)
            rehabilitation of large infrastructure, in particular
            transport infrastructure; b) rehabilitation in urban areas;
            and, c) provision of assistance to rural communities, where
            no service provider has been active in years, perhaps
            decades. While the project will certainly help generate
            "peace dividends", risks nonetheless remain,
            associated with political uncertainties, persistent
            insecurity in some areas, disruption of the economy, and a
            compromised administrative capacity.
