&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
&#13;
It is widely acknowledged that achievement of         During 2006, the WSP, with support from Public-&#13;
the urban Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS)           Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF)&#13;
Millennium Development targets will require           and the African Development Bank (AfDB),&#13;
better access by utilities in Africa to finance, in   sought to better understand how urban water&#13;

many African countries, utility reform has focused    based resources. To this end, a regional&#13;
on creating autonomous governance structures          workshop was held in Pretoria, South Africa, in&#13;
to improve service delivery to an expanding           August 2006 to explore the feasibility of "Market&#13;
customer base. However, implementation of             Finance for Water Utilities in Africa." The&#13;
reforms has, to date, been uneven, constrained        workshop focused on two financing challenges:&#13;
by the absence of appropriate incentives to           to mobilize additional funding resources for&#13;
reform, and hampered by limited access to             development of the water sector; and to ensure&#13;
capital investment funding. In some countries, for    that investment results in sustainable service&#13;
example, South Africa, Senegal, and Namibia,          delivery.&#13;
utilities have successfully sourced capital&#13;
investment from domestic financial markets.           Case studies of six water utilities were presented&#13;
Others, including utilities in Kenya, Uganda, and     at the workshop as well as a survey assessing&#13;
Tunisia, regularly access commercial finance for      the readiness of 14 utilities (including the six&#13;
working capital or minor investments.                 case study utilities) to tap into domestic financial&#13;
                                                      markets. This report will set out a summary of the&#13;
Data provided by utilities and financial providers    case studies, then go on to discuss the qualities&#13;
suggests that one way forward might be to link        and attributes that signal readiness to access&#13;
utility reform with improved access to much-          commercial finance. The report is accompanied&#13;
needed capital funds from domestic financial          by a summary and an overview of the workshop&#13;
markets. Ideally, this strategy would create a        summarizing all of the key outputs.&#13;

Summary                                                    Introduction&#13;
Some of the key points arising from this case              Tunisia is located in a semiarid climatic zone&#13;

        activities led to the utility focusing on core     structural and societal reforms has sought to&#13;
        and noncore business, which has cost               address some of Tunisia's water challenges, and&#13;
        implications. Despite this, SONEDE's               has achieved some successes: a rising standard&#13;
        success is attributable in part to the utility's   of living, expansion of the middle-class,&#13;
        governance structure and management                economic diversification, and a more flexible&#13;
        expertise.                                         economy and society.&#13;

meeting the need for safe drinking water in urban          state administration is in arrears because the&#13;
and rural areas. The third decade saw the                  annual water budget always falls short of actual&#13;
establishment of water desalination facilities             expenditure. To address this, the government&#13;

new connections, SONEDE sets a deadline of                 connection on a quarterly basis over five years.&#13;
15 days, although this deadline is rarely met.             Since 1998, new customers, who opted for a&#13;

development,13 and submits this to the council                                  demonstrated considerable political maturity&#13;
for consideration, as well as the treasury. The                                 throughout the initial transition and into the&#13;
treasury assesses the proposed tariffs                                          present, and largely avoids interference in the&#13;
adjustments based on broader affordability                                      utility's internal affairs. For example, the&#13;
concerns and advises the council, which                                         municipality recently adopted a credit control and&#13;
ultimately sets the tariff. Consequently, although                              debt collection policy, in accordance with the&#13;
full cost-recovery rates determined by the utility                              Municipal Systems Act of 2000. Specifically, the&#13;

budgetary purposes.14 At the end of each year,                                  of a broader municipal bill that includes&#13;
the municipality balances its books,                                            electricity, solid waste, and other charges. If&#13;
acknowledging the difference between revenues                                   payments received amount to less than what is&#13;
collected at the given tariff rate and the full cost                            billed, the water department receives its share&#13;
recovery tariff, and essentially writes off the debt.                           first.15 Highlights from the credit control policy are&#13;
                                                                                illustrated in Table 3.3.&#13;
In the absence of an independent regulator,&#13;
public debate over tariffs often follows election                               Despite these credit controls, the utility&#13;
cycles, and the utility's planning and budgeting                                experiences a high percentage (30%) of&#13;

&#13;

   In many new cities, a developer pays for water mains, which often results in underinvestment. In Durban, the utility pays for&#13;
the water mains as a means to promote development as well as to encourage development that includes access to services.&#13;
14&#13;
   Durban's residential water tariffs were increased by 7.5% in July 2006, which the council believes will provide sufficient&#13;
income to the utility to cover the cost of service provision. The high percentage of Unaccounted-for Water (30%, against&#13;
a target of 2%) due to illegal connections and aging infrastructure, is of particular concern to the municipality,&#13;
against rising debts and rising unemployment, although it is noted that the tariff increases are in line with inflation.&#13;

To address these issues, eThekwini has                                In urban areas, the utility's target response&#13;
developed several training programs. For                              time for service calls is 80% in 24 hours for all&#13;
example, the municipality pays for six students                       service requests, and 100% in 48 hours.&#13;

   within 14 days of an initial request.                   For example, since 2000, the utility has worked&#13;
                                                           to develop and contract local, Black-owned&#13;

Another element of customer service is outreach.           utility's staffing. Cost was also a significant factor&#13;
In urban areas, payment and cost recovery for              in that contractors are considerably less&#13;
water services is minimal, particularly amongst            expensive than full-time staff. Also, contracts with&#13;

growing--constituency of the customer base.                incentives to improve service delivery. For&#13;
To address high debt levels and nonpayment,                example, prior to outsourcing, the utility read&#13;
in 2004, the utility's Community Education                 about 70% of its meters on a quarterly basis.&#13;
Department trained Community Service Agents                Now, because of outsourcing, 99% of meters are&#13;
(CSAs), and assigned them to communities                   read on a monthly basis.&#13;
where nonpayment levels were high.&#13;
Communities were identified through the utility's          In addition to the use of private contractors, the&#13;
GIS system. The CSAs made household visits to              utility has a concession with Durban Water&#13;
discuss water conservation, identify water leaks,          Recycling (Pty) Limited, a consortium led by&#13;

options. By providing a "human" face to the utility,       2001. The concession came about as a result of&#13;
customers signed acknowledgments of debt,                  a planning process to increase the capacity of a&#13;
kick-starting repayment. For customers with very           marine outflow pipeline to meet projected&#13;
high debt loads and low or nonexistent property            wastewater supply, which posed high costs&#13;
values, the utility offered a restructuring of             implications for consumers. An alternative to&#13;
household debt. If a household consistently paid           recycling the bulk of marine discharge for tertiary&#13;
for current water use over a five-year period, its         use by industry was presented and selected.&#13;
"old" debt was written off.                                Given the high technical complexity and&#13;
                                                           associated costs, the utility decided to design a&#13;
Of the 20,000 households targeted, CSAs have               public-private partnership for a 20-year&#13;
currently approached between 7,000 and 8,000,              concession contract between eThekwini Water&#13;
of which roughly 2,500 now make monthly                    Services and Durban Water Recycling. The&#13;
payments. Where defaults continue, the CSAs                concession has benefited both parties: the utility&#13;
undertake additional visits and outreach                   was able to delay capital investment in new bulk&#13;
activities. The CSA approach generated about               water supply infrastructure while "gaining"&#13;
R7 million in revenues over 18 months since its            sufficient water to supply up to 220,000&#13;
inception, against a total cost of R900,000 to             households, and did not have to undertake any&#13;
train and pay the CSAs.                                    new capital investment for the construction&#13;

Utilizing the Private Sector                               companies, the cost of water was reduced&#13;

Ongoing transformation within Johannesburg                         The City of Johannesburg began to transform&#13;

turnaround, implementation of more sustainable                     democratic rule. In Johannesburg, a strategy&#13;
business practices as well as the mobilization                     named iGoli 2002 was developed to tackle the&#13;
and extension of service delivery. Following                       city's core challenges: financial stability, service&#13;
expiry of a five-year management contract with a                   delivery, accountability, administrative efficiency,&#13;
private operator, control of the utility reverted to               and political leadership. Prior to the&#13;
public sector control in July 2006. The following                  implementation of iGoli 2002, 15% of the&#13;
factors contributed to success of both the City of                 population lacked waterborne sewerage, while&#13;
Johannesburg and its water utility:                                13% were without access to safe drinking water.&#13;
&#13;
     The vision and strong leadership to                           This case study profiles the transformation of the&#13;
     successfully complete corporatization of                      City of Johannesburg as a municipal entity, with a&#13;
     public entities.                                              specific focus on Johannesburg Water, and some&#13;
     A multistage approach that began with a                       of the internal and external factors that have led&#13;
     strategic plan to dismantle the existing city                 to its success.&#13;

     capacity for skills transfer.                                 Transformation Process: The City of&#13;

     Johannesburg had utilized over 90% of its                     headed toward bankruptcy. As part of a&#13;
     budgeted expenditure in the past, and this                    turnaround strategy and eventual transformation,&#13;
     has increased to over 95% in the last two                     the city consolidated its 11 administrations into&#13;
     years. Although the city does not have                        five local councils ahead of the 2000 elections.&#13;

     complex problems,23 lenders, nevertheless,                    to overhaul and reform the city's approach to&#13;

  This includes the completeness of its asset register. The City has sought qualified financial statements for five years, but&#13;
the problems are deemed too complex, particularly with the rise in informal service areas, historically weak revenue&#13;

          Water Services Providers (WSPs). The Act                     supporting municipal capital budgets,&#13;
          requires all WSAs to prepare a Water Services                promoting integrated development planning,&#13;

While ONEA lacks the financial autonomy to set                    for the poor recovery rates is a failure by public&#13;

The transformation of Senegal's water sector&#13;
began in 1994 with the introduction of a                            Due to increased demand for water urbanization,&#13;
year-long process to improve urban water                            coupled with the growth in secondary towns,&#13;
management and water service delivery. The                          Senegal faces considerable water constraints,&#13;
process resulted in the introduction of new                         particularly with respect to improved service&#13;
institutional and regulatory frameworks based on                    delivery of drinking water. There is growing&#13;
contracts governing the sector and the                              demand for water by industry and domestic&#13;
dissolution of the national water utility provider.                 users, greater demand for water quality, and&#13;
The changes were driven by continued poor                           rising unemployment and incidence of poverty.&#13;
performance, and increasing financial debt,                         Understanding this situation, the government of&#13;
coupled with reduced ability to recover costs.                      Senegal initiated an institutional reform program&#13;
Under the new arrangement, asset management,                        in 1995-1996, coupled with an investment&#13;

some concerns for the future.                                  eliminate differences in evaluation style, and&#13;

   SONES' royalties are based on the volume of water produced. With increased capital assets, so increase royalty payments.&#13;
However, the government's continued subsidization of farmers has adversely affected SONES' royalties in recent years; this&#13;
is particularly the case with the freeze in tariff increases, effective through 2008.&#13;

SONES and SDE have relied on private finance                      The confidence of the local banking sector&#13;
throughout the reform process. As part of the                     resulting in a second commercial line of credit&#13;
financial modeling process, a shortfall of US$21                  was in 2000, when the Compagnie Bancaire&#13;
million was projected for 1998. To meet this gap,                 d'Afrique Occidentale (Bank of West Africa)&#13;
several approaches were adopted: SDE obtained                     (CBAO), funded the construction of a new&#13;
a commercial bank loan; some donor funding                        drinking water treatment facility through a direct&#13;

Citibank arranged a syndicated line of credit that                the domestic banks of the water sector's&#13;
SONES could draw on with a maximum amount                         credibility, which helped to procure additional&#13;

            Water utilities in Africa : case studies of
            transformation and market access
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            It is widely acknowledged that
            achievement of the urban Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS)
            millennium development targets will require better access by
            utilities in Africa to finance, in particular from domestic
            financial markets. In many African countries, utility reform
            has focused on creating autonomous governance structures to
            improve service delivery to an expanding customer base.
            However, implementation of reforms has, to date, been
            uneven, constrained by the absence of appropriate incentives
            to reform, and hampered by limited access to capital
            investment funding. In some countries, for example, South
            Africa, Senegal, and Namibia, utilities have successfully
            sourced capital investment from domestic financial markets.
            Others, including utilities in Kenya, Uganda, and Tunisia,
            regularly access commercial finance for working capital or
            minor investments. The workshop focused on two financing
            challenges: to mobilize additional funding resources for
            development of the water sector; and to ensure that
            investment results in sustainable service delivery. Case
            studies of six water utilities were presented at the
            workshop as well as a survey assessing the readiness of
            fourteen utilities (including the six case study utilities)
            to tap into domestic financial markets. This report will set
            out a summary of the case studies, then go on to discuss the
            qualities and attributes that signal readiness to access
            commercial finance. The report is accompanied by a summary
            and an overview of the workshop summarizing all of the key outputs.
