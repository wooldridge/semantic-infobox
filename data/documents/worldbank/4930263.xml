&amp;#12;&#13;
A.      BACKGROUNDAND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Country and Sector Background&#13;
&#13;
1.      Afghanistan i s now at a critical point inits history. Significant gains made inthe past&#13;
two years o f reconstructionneed to be consolidated, the Afghan people are eagerly awaiting to&#13;
see more tangible results on the ground, and the country is to transition from an emergency&#13;
recovery to a longer-term nation buildingand reconstruction. After 23 years o f conflict, the&#13;
Afghan people are working with a strong sense o f urgency to restore peace and prosperity. They&#13;
have installed a transitional national government, helda national assembly - the Loya Jirga - and&#13;
approved a new constitution after broad consultations with Afghan citizens.&#13;
&#13;
2.      On the economic front, much has beenachieved inthe past two years. A successful&#13;
currency reform has resulted ina single, stable currency. Fiscalpolicy has remained&#13;
conservative with a no-overdraft policy. The government has established the system for a&#13;
national budget, and prepared a development framework and vision for 2015 to guide the&#13;
country's reconstruction. There are signs o f economic recovery.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Despite significant steps forward, the situation remains fragile with security problems&#13;
encountered almost daily. Afghanistan remains one o f the poorest and longest-suffering&#13;
countries among the members o f the World Bank Group. Three quarters o fthe population lives&#13;
on incomes less than US$2 a day. Greater and faster progress inreconstruction will require&#13;
sustained assistance from the international community.&#13;
&#13;
4.      With scarcenatural resources inthe country, quality educationis a critical ingredient for&#13;
poverty alleviation and economic growth inAfghanistan. The future o f the country depends on&#13;
investment inthe education sector to significantly improve its performance. The demandfor&#13;
education after the fall o f Taliban has continuously exceeded expectations and the capacity o f&#13;
supply. Many teachers do not receive their salaries on time and havereceivedlittle or no&#13;
training, but they continue to come to schools and teach as best they can. This demand, and&#13;
teachers' commitment to education, constitute a critical force for rebuilding the education&#13;
system. However, without a timely response and support, such enthusiasm may not last and a&#13;
golden opportunity may be lost.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Afghanistan has had considerable success inincreasing enrollments since 2002. More&#13;
than three million studentswere enrolled inGrades 1-12 in2002 - nearly twice as many as the&#13;
1.7 million that the govemment and development partners had expected. InMarch 2003, the&#13;
enrollment increased to 4.2 million students ingrades 1-12, o f whom 3.9 million (91 percent)&#13;
were inprimary schools. This figure is by far the largest inthe history o f Afghanistan (Figure 1).&#13;

6.      This enrollment leap, ifit persists, will distort the demographics o fthe school system for&#13;
many years, as the bulge o f new studentsmoves through the system. Fifty-seven percent are&#13;
enrolled ingrades 1-2. Female participation inprimary schools, representing 34 percent o f the&#13;
total enrollment, has exceeded the pre-Taliban period. The aggregate student enrollment by&#13;
grade for 2003 i s shown inFigure 2. Enrollment by province and gender is inAppendix V (Key&#13;
Statistics inthe Education Sector).&#13;

7.      Nevertheless, disaggregated data on net enrollment show stark gender andregional&#13;
disparities. Infew maincities, net enrollment rate is high for both boys and girls; Kabul city, for&#13;
example has 92 percent o f school-age boys and 81percent o f school-age girls enrolled inschool.&#13;
Net enrollment for girls i s higher than boys inthree locations: Herat city, Badakhshan Province,&#13;
and Herat Province. These are indeed remarkable achievements. Elsewhere, however, the&#13;
picture i s still bleak. Total net enrollment rate i s less than 20 percent inthree Provinces --&#13;
Badghis, Hilmand and Uruzgan. The net enrollment rate for girls i s as low as one percent in&#13;

   e  Improving the quality of education: While no output indicators (student leaming&#13;
      achievement, completion rates, etc.) are available to ascertain the current status o f quality&#13;
      o f education inAfghanistan, the available input indicators (teachers' background,&#13;
      curricula, textbook quality and availability, conditions o fphysical learning space, time on&#13;
      task, etc.) strongly suggest that quality i s poor. The lessons leamed from other post-&#13;
      conflict countries suggest that an early focus on the quality o f education-not only access&#13;
      -iskeyforrebuildingtheeducationsector. Studentsshouldbeequippedwithwell-&#13;
      developed literacy and numeracy and skills inproblem solving, team building, critical&#13;
      thinking, and effective communications.&#13;
&#13;
   e  Narrowing gender and regional disparities: While girls account for 34 percent o ftotal&#13;
      enrollment inaggregate due to high enrollment inKabul city, wide gender disparities are&#13;
      persistent inmany southern provinces such as Paktika, Paktya, Khost, Kapisa, Hilmand,&#13;
      Urzugan, Kandahar, Zabul and Ghor where girls represent less than 15 percent o fthe&#13;
      total enrollment. Limitedsupply o f leaming spaces, particularly inappropriate&#13;
      geographical proximity to girls, and lack o f female teachers are major factors&#13;
      constraining girls' education. A policy framework and strategies need to be developed to&#13;
      increase access to education, especially for girls inrural areas, ina cost-effective and&#13;
      phased manner.&#13;
&#13;
   e  Strengthening the role of communities and schools: Many communities and schools&#13;
      have sustained education at the local level one way or another for decades in&#13;
      Afghanistan. It i s imperative to strengthen the capacities o f schools and communities to&#13;
      manage their own affairs to ensure that all children enroll and complete schooling. Poor&#13;
      communications, transportation, and financial infrastructure raise the importance o f&#13;
      strengthening community- and school-based management. A clear selection criteria for&#13;
      school principals has been lacking and their functions have been underutilized. The&#13;
      school principals selected on a merit basis should be trained to perform the roles o f an&#13;
      instructional leader and an administrator to strengthen school-based management.&#13;
&#13;
   e  Defining the role of the Ministry and building its capacity: The Ministryo f Education&#13;
      (M0E)'s view on its role has evolved duringthe past two years. At the beginningo fthe&#13;
      Transitional Islamic State o f Afghanistan, MOE emphasized its role as a direct provider&#13;
      o f services and educational inputs (e.g., printingpress and a furniture workshop inMOE).&#13;
      The Ministryhas now begunputting more stress on its role inpolicy formulation and in&#13;
      regulating and monitoring service delivery by others, including NGOs and the private&#13;
      sector. This change needs to be commended and reinforced together with appropriate&#13;
      capacity buildingo f Provincial EducationDepartments (PEDS)and District Education&#13;
      Departments (DEDs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Government Strategy&#13;
&#13;
9.       The government's vision is to provide good quality educationfor all regardless o f gender,&#13;
ethnicity, language, religion or location, and to provide opportunities for secondary education o f&#13;
an intemational standard to build skilled human resources which are able to meet the private-&#13;
sector driven national development and reconstructionobjectives.&#13;
&#13;
10.      To pursue this vision, the Ministry o fEducation aims to promote broad-based&#13;
participation by all levels o f government - national, provincial, and district - as well as schools&#13;
and communities intaking responsibility for planning and delivering education services. The&#13;
goal i s to gradually put inplace systems o f mutual accountability between levels o f government&#13;
and communities for ensuring that schools perform well. An accompanying goal i s to&#13;
incrementally delegate greater decision making and spending authority to districts, communities&#13;
and schools. All stakeholders will assume responsibilities for frank evaluation o fhow the&#13;
system i s performing and for taking corrective actions when required.&#13;
&#13;
11.      The M O E has embarked on the "Priority Reform and Restructuring" process to&#13;
streamline and strengthen key functional departments o f the MOE: teacher training and&#13;
curriculum development. Inaddition, the Ministry i s currently reforming its overall structure to&#13;
match the new policy - focus on the quality o f education and separating the core business o f&#13;
teaching-learning with support functions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.       BANK'S RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
Transitional Support Strategy Framework&#13;
&#13;
12.      The reconstruction strategy developedby the government o fAfghanistan forms the&#13;
fi-amework within which the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) has been prepared.&#13;
Developedinconsultation with the government and other stakeholders, the TSS puts forward&#13;
priorities for Bank financial and non-financial assistance based on the areas o f comparative&#13;
advantage o f the Bank. The Transitional Support Strategy focuses on four strategic areas: (a)&#13;
improving livelihoods; (b) fiscal strategy, institutions and management; (c) governance and&#13;
public administration reform; and (d) enabling private sector development.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Whenthe transitional strategy was preparedinMarch2003, it was not envisaged that the&#13;
Bank would be involved inthe education sector beyond the ongoing Emergency Education&#13;
Rehabilitation and Development Project, on the assumptionthat the education sector would be&#13;
well fundedby other donors. The situation has evolved differently since then. Donors&#13;
committed only US$ 77 million against the US$250 million education development budget for&#13;
FY1382 (March 2003-March 2004), leaving a hugefundinggap. The Ministers o fFinanceand&#13;
Education requested the Bank (inwriting, inOctober 2003) to support the preparation o f an&#13;
education program on an urgent basis to be financed by IDA and other donors. The proposed&#13;
program i s consistent with the outcome objectives o f the TSS, that is, strengthening communities&#13;
andproviding basic social services to the population.&#13;

&#13;
Rationale for the Bank's Involvement&#13;
&#13;
14.      Support for the education sector at this point inAfghanistan's history -transition from&#13;
emergency recovery assistance to long-term reconstruction and development -i s critical. The&#13;
Bank's experience inthe education sector, indeveloping as well as other post-conflict countries,&#13;
positions it well to support the development and implementation o f a long-term sector&#13;
development program with financial and technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
15.     While UNICEF andUSAID co-chair the Consultative Group for Educationin&#13;
Afghanistan, the Bank i s a focal point for the Technical Working Group for Policy andReform,&#13;
which is chaired by the Minister o fEducation, under the Consultative Group arrangement. This&#13;
places the Bank in a strategic position to help the Ministry o f Education to link policy reform&#13;
with program implementation as well as to coordinate with other development partners.&#13;
&#13;
Lessonsfrom the first EmergencyEducation Rehabilitation and DevelopmentProject&#13;
&#13;
16.     The proposedEQUIPbuilds on the experiences gained inimplementingthe Emergency&#13;
Education Rehabilitation and Development Project, and especially inthe use o f school/&#13;
community grants and incontracting NGOs for community mobilization. Grants for school&#13;
development are currently being piloted infive provinces, with NGOs andPEDs acting as&#13;
facilitation agencies. Although the start-up and community mobilization took longer than&#13;
planned, this decentralized approach and direct support to schools seem to be working&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
effectively, and have the potential to scale up quickly. It has been observed that&#13;
communities/schools tendto use grants for school rehabilitation and construction, giving less&#13;
consideration to other quality-improvement inputs. To pursue a better balance, the proposed&#13;
school grants under EQUIP will be divided into: (a) quality enhancement, and (b) infrastructure&#13;
development to ensure support for quality improvements while meeting the demands for leaming&#13;
space.&#13;
&#13;
17.     Experience with the ongoing project has underscored the importance o f flexibility in&#13;
project design and implementationarrangements, giventhat the needs and the context constantly&#13;
evolve inAfghanistan. The proposed program will buildinsufficient flexibility and monitoring&#13;
mechanisms, and its implementationwill be reviewed on a continuing basis to allow the M O E&#13;
and the government to adjust its implementation strategies and arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
18.     The ongoing emergency project has encountered considerable procurement and&#13;
disbursement delays due to a weak administrative capacity o f the Ministry o f Education. The&#13;
situation i s slowly improving with the establishment o f a Grant Management Unit (GMU) inthe&#13;
MOE. Further streamlining o fthe process and continuous stafftraining will be critical to ensure&#13;
timely implementation o fEQUIP.&#13;
&#13;
Lessons from GlobaVBank Experience in Education in Post-Conflict Situations&#13;
&#13;
19.     The proposedprogram takes account o flessons from experiences o freconstruction o fthe&#13;
education sector inother post-conflict countries.' Lessons applicable to Afghanistan include the&#13;
following.&#13;
&#13;
20.     Conflict generates serious backlogs in education. Damageto physical infrastructure i s&#13;
relatively easy to rectify. A more difficult challenge is the loss o fhuman and institutional&#13;
capacity that frequently accompanies conflict. Teacher training frequently collapses, learners&#13;
drop out, management andpolicy development break down, and resources are channeled to&#13;
military expenditure and away from education, leaving schools without textbooks and leaming&#13;
materials, teachers unpaid and schools unsupervised.&#13;
&#13;
21.     Not business as usual. The added demands created by conflict, the scale o f the&#13;
reconstruction challenge, the urgency o f preventing relapse into violence, and the extremely&#13;
difficult operating conditions call for innovative strategies and programs that address the usual&#13;
development challenges along with the additional problems created by conflict. Even though&#13;
many o f the development tasks are familiar, educationprogramming inpost-conflict societies&#13;
cannot be "business as usual."&#13;
&#13;
22.     Education is a development activity. While education may be an important element o f&#13;
humanitarian assistance and critical for child and social protection, it is also, fundamentally, a&#13;
development activity. It should be oriented towards the country's social, economic, andpolitical&#13;
development and the longer-term interests o f the learners and society.&#13;

                                                  6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23.      Decentralize the system and encourageparental involvement. Duringmost conflict&#13;
situations the energy to sustain delivery o f education shifts to communities and schools, and in&#13;
the early reconstructionphase this energy can provide critical momentum to get schools&#13;
reopened and the system running again. It i s important that efforts to reconstruct the system do&#13;
not undermine the level o f community involvement andparticipation that i s frequently&#13;
engendered duringconflict. Community action, involvement, and ownership will be key to the&#13;
security and sustainability o freconstructionefforts. Enhancingcommunity participation can&#13;
promote the effectiveness and efficiency o f implementation. Central government can best&#13;
convince communities o f its legitimate leadership through provision o f support to communities&#13;
inways that empower them. At the sametime, mechanisms that deliver resources directly to&#13;
schools and communities must be progressively integrated into the emerging administrative and&#13;
monitoring system, to avoid the emergence o fparallel bureaucracies.&#13;
&#13;
24,     Acknowledge the importance of ongoing commitment to quality improvement. The most&#13;
profound and lasting impact o f conflict on education was on quality rather than on access. Post-&#13;
conflict situations often induce an "access first, quality later" approach. Rebuildingquality i s&#13;
one o f the most significant challenges inreconstruction, and should be a consideration from the&#13;
outset. Quality is a concem o f all communities, parents, teachers and students. Strategies to&#13;
address it are most successful when implemented as an ongoing process rather than as a response&#13;
to some standard determined historically or externally. Involving communities, parents, and&#13;
teachers indiscussing quality improvement has strong retums interms o f recognizing quality&#13;
improvement as a process. Discussions about how to improve the quality o f leaming ando f the&#13;
leaming environment are as important intemporary leaming spaces under trees or canvas as they&#13;
are inestablished systems.&#13;
&#13;
25.      Teachers are the most critical resource in education reconstruction. It i s vital to make&#13;
early moves to consolidate the teaching corps and ensure their appropriate remuneration,&#13;
utilization, and training. Conflict usually has profound and negative impact on a country's&#13;
teacher corps. Frequentlydispersed, sometimes killed and often unpaid or underpaid, teacher&#13;
supplypresents a complex array o fproblems for reconstruction. Reconstruction usually begins&#13;
with a cohort o f existing teachers inherited from previous systems and from community or&#13;
private initiatives that sprang up during conflict. Inthe early post-conflict period, qualified&#13;
teachers may be attracted out o f the teaching professionto more rewarding opportunities, while a&#13;
large number o f unqualified teachers may be drawn into the system, creating a need for both&#13;
rationalization and professional development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C.       PROPOSEDPROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
0bjective&#13;
&#13;
26.     EQUIP aims to improve the quality o f educational inputs and processes as the foundation&#13;
for a long-term strategy to enhance the quality o f educational outcomes. This will be achieved&#13;
through: (a) a focus on schools and communities to strengthen their capacity to better manage&#13;
teaching-learning activities; (b) investment inhuman resources (teachers, principals and&#13;
educational administration personnel) and physical facilities; and (c) institutional development o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
schools, DEDs, PEDs and the MOE. The program also aims to promote education for girls by&#13;
puttinga priority for female teachers and students within each component activity.&#13;
&#13;
27.    As shown inFigure 3 below, the program aims to put schools at the center o f activities&#13;
and the top o f the systemwhereby PEDs and DEDs and the M O E will be supporting the well-&#13;
functioning o f schools.&#13;

ProgramDescription&#13;
&#13;
28.     To achieve the objective, the program would finance the following components:&#13;
&#13;
       (1)   Grants to schools for: (a) quality enhancement; and (b) infrastructure development;&#13;
       (2)   Support to schools through human resources development and institutionbuilding&#13;
             for: (a) teacher development programs; (b) school principal selection and training;&#13;
             and (c) capacity building o fPEDS andDEDs to strengthen their school support&#13;
             functions; and&#13;
       (3)   Support for policy development and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
29.    With IDA grant financing, the MOEplans to roll out the program inten Provinces (five&#13;
Provinces from the ongoing emergency education project, and five additional Provinces). As co-&#13;
financing becomes available the program can be scaled up to other provinces. A summary o f&#13;
component activities are presented inTable 2, followed by a briefnarrative explanation.&#13;

Component 1: School Grants (US$21 million)&#13;
&#13;
30.     Grants to schools are designedto achieve two complementary objectives through a&#13;
greater emphasis on school- and community-based decision making. First, school grants will&#13;
support efforts to improve teaching and leaming and create effective school environments.&#13;
Second, school grants will support the improvement o f basic school facilities at existing&#13;
government registered primary, middle and secondary schools with teachers on payroll. Priority&#13;
will be given to: (a) girls schools; (b) schools with bothboys' and girls' sectiondshifts; and (c)&#13;
boys schools which plan to open up sections/shifts for girls. The program will continue the&#13;
school-level grant program that i s beingpiloted infive provinces (Badakhshan, Bamyan, Kapisa,&#13;
Logar, Parwan) under the ongoing project andwill cover another five provinces inthe Southern&#13;
Region where girls' enrollment i s low.&#13;
&#13;
Component 1.1:School Grants for Quality Enhancement (US$ 10 million)&#13;
&#13;
31.     School Grants for quality enhancement would be provided to schools for quality&#13;
improvement activities based on School Improvement Plans prepared by Parent Teachers&#13;
Associations (PTAs) and/or School Management Committees (SMCs), usingtechnical assistance&#13;
provided by Provincial and District Education Departments, andNGOs active inthe area. Where&#13;
the National Solidarity Program is beingimplemented, School Management Committees would&#13;
include the members o f Community Development Councils inorder to ensure synergy between&#13;
community development and school management and avoid duplication o f effort. The School&#13;
Improvement Plans will outline a plan for three years with activities for the first year beingmore&#13;
detailed. Basedon the plan, a school can use the grant to finance activities such as teacher&#13;
training, additional teacher support for supervision, education materials and supplies,&#13;
supplementary readers, toolkits, expenditures for workshops, seminars, meetings and&#13;
transportation for teachers and PTA membersto participate inappropriate meetings. The grants&#13;
will aim to develop healthy linkages betweenschools, communities andlocal govemment while&#13;
supporting and empowering schools and communities as managers.&#13;
&#13;
32.     At the time o fthis programpreparation, it was envisaged that other development partners&#13;
would finance basic educational materials, including textbooks, for the next 2-3 years. However,&#13;
ifsupport from other development partners does notmaterialize, EQUIPwouldpartially finance&#13;
the provision o f educational materials, including textbooks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Component1.2: SchoolGrantsfor InfrastructureDevelopment(US$ 11million)&#13;
&#13;
33.     School Grants for infrastructure development will be provided, based on priority criteria,&#13;
for the repair and rehabilitation o f school facilities. These grants would also finance limitednew&#13;
construction o f school buildingsthat are already registered with MOE. The communities in&#13;
difficult access areas may follow traditional approaches to school design and construction&#13;
methods. The program will assist M O E inreviewing technical approaches and developing&#13;
guidelines on appropriate school building options. Support to communities for use o f an&#13;
improved buildingmodel will be provided by the Department o f Construction ina limited&#13;
number o fselected provinces andbyNGOsinother provinces.&#13;
&#13;
34.     Duringcommunity mobilization process, the Ministry o fEducationwill disseminate&#13;
information on school grants through PEDs andDEDs, and with support o f NGOs where&#13;
appropriate. PEDs and DEDswill conduct a rapid needs assessment for school construction/&#13;
rehabilitation to avoid duplication o f efforts and facilitate equitable distribution o f support. This&#13;
component will require: (a) a system o f technical and social facilitators; (b) active school and&#13;
community representation through PTAs/SMCs which include the members o f Community&#13;
Development Councils; (c) a process for technical review o f the School Improvement Plan and&#13;
the provision o f technical assistance during grant implementation; (d) support to schools/SMCs&#13;
for financial management, procurement and implementationmanagement; (e) full transparency,&#13;
through a proactive program o f social audit, verbal and written disclosure (financial information&#13;
posted inschool); (f) an efficient, reliable andrapid system for local-level disbursements; and (g)&#13;
a process o f quarterly evaluation and review to adapt the plan as appropriate. Where Community&#13;
Development Councils are active, they would play an important role inmonitoring the progress&#13;
and transparent and accountable use o f funds.&#13;
&#13;
35.     This component activity would be closely coordinatedwith the National Solidarity&#13;
Program, and any other school construction activities inAfghanistan, at MOE, province- and&#13;
district-levels to facilitate efficient and equitable distribution o f school&#13;
rehabilitation/construction andpromote synergy and cross-fertilization o f experiences inschool&#13;
construction.&#13;
&#13;
Component2: Supportto Schools throughInstitutionalandHumanResourceDevelopment&#13;
(US$ 11.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
36.     This component will provide technical and financial support for training keypersonnel,&#13;
to enable them to carry out respective functions more effectively and to support school-based&#13;
management. Training o f teachers, school principals and staff o f PEDS and DEDswill be the&#13;
primary activity inthis component supplementedby the grants provided to PEDs and DEDs for&#13;
their institutional development (including infrastructure).&#13;
&#13;
Component2.1: Teacher Training (US$7 million)&#13;
&#13;
37.     This component o f EQUIP will help to finance Teacher EducationProgram, which is&#13;
jointly ledby the Ministry o f Education, Ministry o f Higher Education, and the Academic&#13;
Council o f Education and supported by development partners including Denmark, Japan,&#13;
UNICEF, USAID, and the World Bank. The Ministry o f Education is currently developing a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
national unifiedteacher training curriculum that i s competency-based and modularized. The&#13;
training i s beingdesignedto widen teachers' knowledge on subject content and develop&#13;
"modem" student-centered pedagogical skills. To ensure the quality o f teacher training, this&#13;
component will provide systemic support for upgrading and updating o fteacher trainers.&#13;
&#13;
38.      The implementation strategy for teacher training is to bringthe training closer to schools&#13;
instead o fbringingteachers to Kabul or Provincial capitals, andto provide teachers with&#13;
continuous support and feedback as they work. To reduce the professional isolation o f teachers,&#13;
particularly those inrural schools, the component will finance different implementation&#13;
modalities (for example, mobile teams, use o f Teacher Resource Centers attached to a school to&#13;
complement a cascade model) inthe ten Provinces where School Grants are to be implemented.&#13;
The expansion strategy for the second and third year would be decidedbased onthe evaluation&#13;
o f the first year's experience.&#13;
&#13;
39.      To implement the new teacher training curriculum, the core team o f the Teacher&#13;
Education Program and the Teacher Training Department o f the M O E will be supported by a&#13;
team o f international and national education specialists, who are expected to bringto bear their&#13;
knowledge o f modempedagogic techniques and relevant innovations.&#13;
&#13;
Component2.2: Training of Principals (US$ 1.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
40.      To enhance the capacity o f school principals as good managers as well as effective&#13;
instructional leaders, the training of school principals will be supported inthis component. First,&#13;
this component will support MOEinreforming the selectioncriteria for schoolprincipals. Itwill&#13;
also help to define the responsibility and accountability structure o f schoolprincipals, andwill&#13;
develop training modules to match the new functions. International good practice will be applied&#13;
inredefining the functions and selection criteria, andindeveloping training modules. Master&#13;
trainers will be trained, and trainers from NGOs will also be usedto provide training at Province-&#13;
and District-level and facilitate cross-fertilization, for example through organizing school&#13;
principals' workshops and study visits to other provinces.&#13;
&#13;
41.      The Ministry o fEducation is currently planning to undertake the "Priority Reformand&#13;
Restructuring" process for the reform o f school principals to ensure a transparent and&#13;
competitive selection as well as enhanced social and economic status o f the school principals.&#13;

Component2.3: CapacityBuildingof Districtand ProvincialEducationDepartments&#13;
(US$3 million)&#13;
&#13;
42.      The role and capacity o fProvincial EducationDepartments to manage a quality&#13;
provincial education systemneeds a special focus. Technical support will be provided to review&#13;
and revise the terms o f reference and organizational structure o f PEDS and DEDs to enhance&#13;
their efficiency and effectiveness. Part o ftheir role is to oversee and coordinate the inputs&#13;
provided by other agencies. While PEDSwill follow the policy directives o f the MOE for&#13;
program implementation, they will needsufficient devolution o f authority to make decisions on&#13;
an agreed range o f activities in order to expedite implementation. Inparticular, they will need to&#13;
be able to approve spending(under pre-arranged ceilings) andto make decisions on the&#13;
recruitment o f contract staff (under pre-agreed grades andnumbers) without reference to MOE.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43.     Regular in-country training will be provided in areas such as planning, management and&#13;
administration, recruitment o fpersonnel, budget and financial management, accounting,&#13;
educational development, and monitoring and supervision o fteaching. The actionplan for&#13;
training at the Provincial level will include the management and administrative training required&#13;
by Districts Education Departments. PEDSwill also organize training programs for school&#13;
principals with support from DEDs and NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
44.     Provincial Education Departments and District EducationDepartmentswill be provided&#13;
with funds to develop institutional capacity and upgrade physical facilities. Fundamounts will&#13;
be decidedusinga formula with both fixed andper capita components. This component will be&#13;
closely coordinated with the Afghanistan Stabilization P r ~ g r a m . ~&#13;
&#13;
Component 3: Policy Development and Monitoring and Evaluation (US$2.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
Component 3.1: Policy Development (US$ 1million)&#13;
&#13;
45.      Continuing the technical assistance provided under the ongoing educationproject, this&#13;
component will support the Ministryo f Education to implement a medium-term policy&#13;
framework, and to prepare a sound National Development Budget each year. The component&#13;
will also help buildthe capacity o fMOE officials to use the EducationManagement Information&#13;
System, that the Ministry i s currently developing. It will support the annual data collection from&#13;
schools inorder to promote the use o f data inplanning and decision making. It will also support&#13;
M O E inundertaking a household survey to assess the status o f schooling of children, direct and&#13;
indirect cost o f schooling, and any other opportunities and constraints concerning education.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3.2: Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 1.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
46.      The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) component, as an integral part o f EQUIP,will&#13;
provide timely and adequate information to stakeholders on implementation performance,&#13;
process, outputs and outcomes. It aims to provide timely feedback so that lessons can be learned&#13;
intime to make mid-course adjustments where necessary. Itwill putinplace a system to&#13;
monitor and evaluate the implementation o f the main interventions: teacher development, school&#13;
improvement grants, rehabilitation and construction o f schools, and policy development.&#13;
&#13;
47.      The M&amp;E systemwould have four components: (a) physical and financial monitoring o f&#13;
implementation; (b) process monitoring; (c) post-implementationmonitoring, including&#13;
monitoring o f the sustainability o f school grant activities and financial audit; and (d) outcome&#13;
evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation will be distinct processes. The interventions and&#13;
achievement o f program objectives will be evaluated by a third-party organization, which will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Afghanistan Stabilization Programaims to provide basic security and good governance inthe districts and&#13;
   provinces o f Afghanistan, through well-sequenced and coordinated developmental interventions focusing o n&#13;
   security, governance, and reconstruction. Subprograms include: (a) Provincial StabilizationFund; (b) Training&#13;
   and Recruitment; (c) District Infrastructure; and (d) Administrative Reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
submit an annual evaluation report to the Grant ManagementUnit o fMOE and the Ministryo f&#13;
Finance.&#13;
&#13;
48.      School grant activities will be monitored by SMCdPTAs, and supervised by District&#13;
EducationDepartments and NGOs where these work as facilitation agencies. Progress in&#13;
implementingschool improvement plans and the use o f grants will bepubliclyposted at schools&#13;
and/or locations for community gathering. Where they exist, Community Development Councils&#13;
o f the National Solidarity Programwill play an important role insocial audits. All project data&#13;
and information inthe prescribed formats will be transmitted to planningofficers inPEDSand&#13;
the Ministryo fFinance (MOF). Planningofficers would work closely with District Education&#13;
Officers to prepare statistical and monthly reports for the GMU and other relevant departments&#13;
o fMOE, and MOF.&#13;
&#13;
49.      A baseline surveywill be conducted at the start o fthe program on the basis o fwhich&#13;
progress would be monitored and assessedaccording to agreed targets. The data from the survey&#13;
will assist insettingrealistic targets to be achieved. Follow-up surveys at the endo f year two&#13;
and annual surveys would be conducted to monitor the cost, impact, and implementation o fthe&#13;
school-based funding scheme, plus annual updating o f the school mapping database and&#13;
evaluation o f construction progress.&#13;
&#13;
50.      The program will support the Ministry o f Education incarrying out the verification o f&#13;
teachers -their numbers, attendance, and levels o f qualifications and skills, Technical and&#13;
financial support will be provided to MOE to undertake an expenditure tracking survey to assess&#13;
the flow o f funds, including salary payment, from central Ministries to schools.&#13;
&#13;
51.      Finally, EQUIP will support the Ministry o f Education to carry out an assessment o f&#13;
learning achievements. The component will support the development o f a core team, skilled in&#13;
student assessment strategies, who will impart these strategies to teachers andprincipals as part&#13;
o f their training programs. The focus will be on formative assessment to enable teachers to&#13;
ascertain students' learning progress and constraints on a continuing basis. The core team will&#13;
also be trained insummative assessment strategies using standardized testing. An appropriate&#13;
student assessmentmechanismwill be developed through pilot activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D.       INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
InstitutionalArrangements&#13;
&#13;
52.      The Ministryo f Education, through its central, provincial and district departments, will&#13;
be responsible for the overall execution o f the program. Incoordination with line departments,&#13;
the Grant Management Unit (GMU) will be responsible for program monitoring, reporting and&#13;
financial management. MOE will form a Program Steering Committee to set operationalpolicy&#13;
guidelines,monitor progress, and address issues. Guidedby the Steering Committee, GMUwill&#13;
also coordinate the technical assistance, evaluation, and policy-relevant research studies to be&#13;
financed under the proposed program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                  16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53.     Provincial Education Departments will beresponsible for the overall management of the&#13;
School Grants(Component 1). The Department of Construction will provide overall technical&#13;
guidance to school construction and rehabilitationcarried out through School Grants in&#13;
Component 1. Close coordination will be maintained with the National Solidarity Program.&#13;
MOE's Teacher Training Department will be responsible for the technical aspects o fhuman&#13;
resource development, andwill leadthe Teacher Education Program (Component 2). The&#13;
Teacher Training Department i s currently carrying out the Priority Restructuring and Reform,&#13;
andthe process is expected to be completedbythe fall o f 2004. Wherenecessary, MOEwill&#13;
contract out technical support (e.g., community mobilization) needed to strengthen the capacity&#13;
o fparticipating PEDs and DEDsto deliver the school-based program. MOEwill be responsible&#13;
for the procurement o f goods, works, and services with assistance fromthe central government&#13;
procurement agent inthe Ministryo f Reconstruction.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Procurement&#13;
&#13;
55.      The Grant Management Unit (GMU) o f Ministry o f Educationwill have the overall&#13;
responsibility for program implementation. An assessment o f the procurement capacity o f the&#13;
GMUshows that it lacks adequate capacity to undertake procurement activities for the Program.&#13;
Based on the findings o f the assessment, and the overall public procurement environment inthe&#13;
country, the procurement risk for the program i s considered "High." Actions have thus been&#13;
agreed with GMUto minimize procurement-related risk and build GMU's procurement capacity,&#13;
as detailed inAppendix 11. Procurement under the Program will be carried out primarily by the&#13;
government central procurement unit inthe Ministry o f Reconstruction with technical inputs&#13;
from GMU. The procurement procedures and the prior review thresholds have been determined&#13;
keeping inview the procurement capacity o f the implementing agency and the public&#13;
procurement environment inthe country.&#13;
&#13;
56.      Procurement for the proposedprogram will be carried out inaccordance with the World&#13;
Bank's Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (May 2004); and&#13;
Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by WorldBank Borrowers (May 2004),&#13;
and the provisions stipulated inthe Legal Agreement. Goods procuredunder this project would&#13;
include vehicle and equipment. The procurement will be undertaken through international&#13;
competitive biddingusingthe Bank's Standard BiddingDocuments (SBD). Works procured&#13;
underthis project, would include: rehabilitation o f school and administrative buildings. The&#13;
procurement will be done through national competitive biddingusingthe Bank's SBD for small&#13;
works agreed with (or satisfactory to) the Bank. The small valued contracts estimated to cost not&#13;
more than US$ 50,000 equivalent may be procured through the community contracting&#13;
procedures, described inAppendix 11. Consultants' Services would include Technical Assistance&#13;
contracts for human resource development and policy development. Short lists o f consultants for&#13;
services estimated to cost less than $ 50,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely o f&#13;
national consultants in accordance with the provisions o fparagraph 2.7 o f the Consultant&#13;
Guidelines. For services exceeding US$ 200,000, preferredmethod o f selection will be Quality&#13;
and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) and for less than US$ 200,000, selection by Consultants&#13;
Qualifications (CQ) may be adopted.&#13;
&#13;
57.      With respect to each contract for works estimated to cost the equivalent o f $100,000 or&#13;
more, the first two contracts for rehabilitation o f the urbanschool buildings, the first contract for&#13;
rehabilitation o f the Provincial Education Department buildingand the first contract for the&#13;
rehabilitation o f the peri-urban school buildingwill be subject to IDA'Sprior review. With&#13;
respect to each contract for goods estimated to cost the equivalent o f $100,000 or more will be&#13;
subject to IDA'Sprior review. With respect to each contract for the employment o f consulting&#13;
firms estimated to cost the equivalent o f $100,000 or more will be subject to IDA'Sprior review.&#13;
&#13;
FinancialManagement&#13;
&#13;
58.      No Country Profile o fFinancial Accountability or Country Financial Accountability&#13;
Assessment has beenprepared for Afghanistan. However, IDA has gained substantial insight&#13;
from several ongoing projects that support public administration capacity buildingin&#13;
Afghanistan. The overall assessment is that though the country's financial management system&#13;
i s not fully functional, the government has made significant progress inputtinginplace a basic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
public expenditure management system at the Ministryo f Finance, including fiduciary oversight&#13;
functions. IDA and several other donors will continue to provide technical assistance for&#13;
capacity building o f all line ministries infinancial management over the medium term. Details&#13;
o f the financial management arrangements are inAppendix I.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards&#13;
&#13;
59.      The proposedEQUIPhas been prepared under the Bank's Operational Policy 8.50&#13;
EmergencyRecovery Assistance. The Environmental and Social Safeguard Framework&#13;
developed for emergency projects inAfghanistan will be applied. The program is classified as&#13;
environmental category "B." As a result o fmore than two decades o f conflict, the exodus o f&#13;
trained personnel, low salaries, and the lack o f exposure to new approaches, Afghanistan's&#13;
institutional capacity i s weak, especially insuch specialized areas as safeguard policies. To&#13;
address this issue, IDA i s preparing a technical assistance project on safeguard issues for key&#13;
ministries including the Ministry o f Education.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                   FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, DISBURSEMENT,&#13;
                              AND AUDIT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
CountryIssues&#13;
&#13;
1.      The World Bank has gained significant experience andunderstanding o f the financial&#13;
management issues inAfghanistan from implementing multiple projects over the past 24 months.&#13;
The overall assessment is that although the country's financial management system i s not yet&#13;
fully functional, especially for managingdonor projects, appropriate institutional andprogram-&#13;
specific mitigation measures are beingtaken for the proposed Education Quality Improvement&#13;
Program. These measures will help to ensure fiduciary financial accountability for program&#13;
funds.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Inaneffort to strengthen key institutions, the World Bankis financing aFinancial&#13;
Management Agent to assist the Ministryo f Finance, an Audit Agent to assist the Control and&#13;
Audit Office, and aProcurement Agent to assist inProcurement-relatedactivities. USAID and&#13;
the IndianAid Assistance Programmeare also financing a team o f consultants and advisors to&#13;
assist the D a Afghanistan Bank inlocal as well as foreign currency operations.&#13;
&#13;
Strengths&#13;
&#13;
3.      The commitment o f the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan towards accountability and&#13;
transparency inits operations i s one o f its strengths because it provides confidence to IDA&#13;
management with regards to accountability and transparency inthe utilization o f funds. Through&#13;
the engagement o f the FinancialManagement Agent, the government is now ina position to&#13;
ensure proper accounting for local payments. The government has also put inplace additional&#13;
mechanisms including: (a) the Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) under the Treasury Department&#13;
for disbursements and maintenance o f Afghanistan Management Information System (AFMIS)&#13;
which entails recording o f all governmentaltransactions and a centralized payment system; (b)&#13;
the Development Budget and External Relations (DBER) Unitunder the Budget Department for&#13;
overall management and reporting o f all donor projects; and (c) the Cash Management Unit&#13;
under the overall charge o fthe Treasury Department to account for all income and manage cash&#13;
resources.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The strengths specific to proposed program include the engagement o f a Financial&#13;
Management Specialist assisting the Grant Management Unit (GMU) within the Ministryo f&#13;
Education (MOE). This is important because the program involves a number o f agencies and&#13;
consultants and a designated person is needed to ensure proper financial management&#13;
arrangements for these agencies. Another strength i s the mobilization o f a Counterpart Chief&#13;
Financial Officer (CCFO), retainedunder the Strengthening Financial Capacity project (funded&#13;
by Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund), to support budgeting and financial management o f&#13;
the Ministry o fEducation as a whole. The CCFO will work closely with the govemment-&#13;
appointed ChiefFinancial Officer/Finance Manager inthe Ministryto help strengthen its&#13;
capacity to manage its reconstruction and development program, including donor-financed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
projects. GMUwill develop a Project ImplementationManual with a section on "Funds Flow&#13;
and Financial Management" which addressesprocedures as well as internal controls o f various&#13;
aspects o f the funds flow, the funds transfer mechanism, disbursement to communitiesA'arent&#13;
Teachers AssociationsBchool Management Committees, and fund management at these levels.&#13;
&#13;
Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
5.     Like all projects inAfghanistan, this program mightbe affectedbyweaknesses&#13;
associated with evolving Afghan institutions and systems for financial management, reporting,&#13;
auditing, and banking. There are severe shortages o f experienced and trained in-country finance&#13;
professionals in central agencies including the Ministryo f Finance as well as inthe Ministry o f&#13;
Education, and even more so at the province and district levels.&#13;
&#13;
6.     From the perspective o f financial management, the main weakness is lack o f financial&#13;
management capacity within the Ministryo f Education. One reason is that financial&#13;
management systems inthe M O E andmost other ministries are not geared to manage foreign&#13;
grants and to interact with donor agencies. However, the creation o f the Grant Management&#13;
Unit,engagement offinancial management specialist, appointmentofa CCFO, andacounterpart&#13;
manager and staff will address this weakness. It will be important for the CCFO not only to&#13;
work with the GMU, but also with the accounting/finance department inMOE to expose them to&#13;
international financial management arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
7.     Inconclusion, the financial management arrangements, including systems, processes,&#13;
procedures, and staffing are considered adequate to support this program, subject to the&#13;
implementation o f the proposed action plan.&#13;
&#13;
ImplementingMinistry/Agency&#13;
&#13;
8.     The Ministry o fEducation, through its central, provincial, and district departments, will&#13;
be responsible for the overall management o f the program. The Grant Management Unit within&#13;
the MOE, with assistance from Advisors including the Financial Management Specialist, will be&#13;
responsible for overall project monitoring, reporting, and financial management. Provincial&#13;
EducationDepartments will be responsible for managing School Grants (Component 1) ineach&#13;
province. Inthe field, MOE's Department of Construction will provide technical guidance&#13;
relating to school construction and rehabilitation carried out through School Grants.&#13;
&#13;
9.     The Teacher Training Department o fthe MOEwill be responsible for the technical&#13;
aspects o f human resource development (Component 2). When necessary, MOEwill contract&#13;
out technical support (e.g., community mobilization) to strengthen the provincial and district&#13;
capacity to deliver the school-based program inparticipating provinces. The GMUwith&#13;
assistance from advisors, will be responsible for procurement o f goods, works, and services with&#13;
assistance from the government central procurement unit inthe Ministry of Reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
FundsFlow&#13;
&#13;
10.    Program funds will be deposited ina Special Account (SA) to be opened and maintained&#13;
at the DaAfghanistan Bank (DAB). Special Account, inkeeping with current practices for other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
projects inAfghanistan, will be operated by the Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) o f the&#13;
Treasury Department within the Ministryo f Finance. The SA will be funded initiallybased on a&#13;
Payment Application request. Subsequent applications for replenishment to the Special Account&#13;
will be submitted monthly.&#13;
&#13;
11.     The Ministry o f Educationwill make requests to SDUfor payments from Special&#13;
Account funds. Payments will be made out o fthe Special Account on the basis o f approved&#13;
contracts entered into by MOE, PEDs, and DEDs with contractors, consultants, NGOs, Parent&#13;
Teachers Associations, and School Management Committees. Inaddition to payments out o fthe&#13;
Special Account, M O E may also request the SDU to make direct payments for Components 2&#13;
and 3 to NGOs and consultants, and special commitments for contracts covered by letters o f&#13;
credit inaccordance with World Bank procedures.&#13;
&#13;
12.     All project payments pertainingto Technical Assistance (TA) forming part o fcomponent&#13;
2 and 3 will be made to either international firmshndividuals or local firmshdividuals. They&#13;
will have bank accounts ineither DAB, a local commercial bank, or an overseas bank. All&#13;
project payments will be made either through bank transfers directly into the accounts or else by&#13;
check payment. The bank account details o f TA consultants will be obtained at the time o f&#13;
finalizing contracts.&#13;
&#13;
13.     Operating expenditures for workshops, transportation, and other items forming part o f&#13;
component 2 and 3 will be paid to the GMUfrom the SA based on an invoice from GMU&#13;
providing details o f the expenditures. The first such payment will be for an advance on the basis&#13;
o f a "No Objection'' from the Task Team Leader.&#13;
&#13;
14.     Component 1 - School Grants: These payments will be made out o f the SA based on&#13;
proposals outlined inadvance usingthe current funds flow system that i s used for the&#13;
government operational budget. This system entails disbursement o f funds inProvinces through&#13;
mustofiat~.~    The complete disbursement protocols along with detailed procedures has been&#13;
prepared by SDU inconsultationwith MOE andDBER and will be inplace prior to&#13;
disbursementunderthis component. The hnds flow includes these broad steps:&#13;
&#13;
                MOEprepares aproject code sheet which clearly allocates budget codes under&#13;
                which payments can be requested byMOE from MOFlmustofats.&#13;
                M O E submits a fundingrequest to SDU and advises Provincial Education&#13;

&#13;
15.     A pilot project under the existing Emergency Education Rehabilitation andDevelopment&#13;
Project i s expected to be undertaken inBadakhshan Province. Basedon lessons learnt inthat&#13;
pilot, disbursement protocols and procedures for this project will be finalized.&#13;
&#13;
Systems&#13;
&#13;
16.      The proposedprogram will rely on government systems supplemented byproject-specific&#13;
arrangements to recordproject financial transactions inan electronic format using simple&#13;
spreadsheet and/or database applications. This will enable the GMUinthe MOE to readily&#13;
retrieve the financial information requiredto produce the quarterly Financial MonitoringReports&#13;
(FMRs)informats to be agreedwith IDA. These systems, when fully implemented, are&#13;
considered adequate to support the financial management requirementso f EQUIP.&#13;
&#13;
Staffing and Training&#13;
&#13;
17.      The Grant Management Unit is headed by a director who reports to the Minister o f&#13;
Education. The GMUi s responsible for the managing special education grants, developing&#13;
management capacity, preparing the Ministry's Development Budget, and coordinating all donor&#13;
assistance to the Ministry.&#13;
&#13;
18.      The staffing requirements o f GMU along withjob descriptions for each position have&#13;
been assessedby M O E and are found to be adequate. GMU i s inthe process o f filling the&#13;
positions through external support as well as appointing government staff. There is a needto fill&#13;
the positions o f financial management specialist anddatabase administrator prior to program&#13;
disbursements. Currently, international consultants from the CCFO project, and several&#13;
development partners are assisting the government staff in GMUto perform these functions.&#13;
The CCFO and the counterpart manager and staff will be inplace to oversee the financial&#13;
management aspects o f the program.&#13;
&#13;
19.      The Special Disbursement Unit inthe MOF, supported by the Financial Management&#13;
Agent staff, will prepare withdrawal applications, take steps to transfedmake payments,&#13;
undertake project accounting, and prepare SOEs and financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20.     To strengthen the staffing capacity o f SDU, recently three Afghan nationals with&#13;
economics degrees and computer and Englishlanguage skills have been hired. To facilitate&#13;
project activities and to train new appointees a document entitled "Documentation Guidelines" i s&#13;
available at the SDU. The SDUwill bringto the notice o f all the implementing agencies (e.g.,&#13;
mustofiats, PEDs, and DEDs)the contents o f these guidelines and disbursement protocols and&#13;
procedures o f this program. The SDUwill also provide any necessary training and staff&#13;
orientation.&#13;
&#13;
21.     Each mustofzat office inprovinces i s staffed with a head o fpayments, head o f revenues,&#13;
head o f accounting and reporting, and finance officers. A joint IDA and M O F field visit to&#13;
Badakhshanhas beenundertaken and the staffing at mustofzats, PEDs and DEDs is found to be&#13;
adequate to manage the operational as well as development budgets o f the government. Based&#13;
on experience with the pilot project inBadakhshan, an assessment will be made whether&#13;
additional staffing and skills are needed.&#13;
&#13;
22.     A training workshop for the staff o fmustofzats andPEDs for the pilot project in&#13;
Badakhshanhas beencarried out by the SDU to explain indetail the flow o f funds, disbursement&#13;
protocols, and procedures. Similar workshops will be held prior to disbursement for this&#13;
program for a wider group o f staff.&#13;
&#13;
AccountingPoliciesandProcedures&#13;
&#13;
23.     The proposedprocedures for EQUIP are as follows. The Accounting Office o f the MOE&#13;
prepares supporting documents for expenditures and payment orders (Form M16), receives&#13;
approval from the Controller (via a pre-payment audit agent o f the MOF located inthe MOE),&#13;
obtains final approval o f the Minister or designee, and submits documentation to the Treasury&#13;
Department. The Treasury Department issues a check payable to the Cash Trustee by D a&#13;
Afghanistan Bank after verification o f supporting documents and approvals. The Cash Trustee&#13;
receives the money from the bank and disburses it to the intendedpayees. Currently the M O E&#13;
records transactions based on a single-entry, manual, cash basis o f accounting.&#13;
&#13;
24.     EQUIPwill follow standard government financial management policies andprocedures,&#13;
including the chart o f accounts developedby the Financial Management Agent to record project&#13;
expenditures. The Accounting Department enters these transactions inan expenditures book&#13;
(Form M20) and prepares a monthly expenditures report on form M22. The MOE receives its&#13;
operationalbudget allotments on a quarterly basis from the MOF.&#13;
&#13;
25.     The M O E Grant Management Unitwill be responsible for coordination with the SDU. It&#13;
will also be responsible for coordinating financial management activities o fimplementing&#13;
agencies with the SDU. Because there will be several agencies involved, it is important that the&#13;
GMU's responsibilities, functions, andnecessary procedures are developed and documented ina&#13;
brief set o f financial management guidelines. These guidelines are expected to be sufficient to&#13;
cover various aspects o f project financial management which the GMUwill handle. The&#13;
guidelines will lay down clear instructions on how different agencies will ensure that necessary&#13;
fiduciary controls are inplace regarding expenditures incurred. It i s expected that the guidelines&#13;
will be ready within three months o fthe project becoming effective. The guidelines will needto&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
be authorizedby the MOF consideringit has the overall responsibility for fiduciary compliance&#13;
and then approved by IDA.&#13;
&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
26.    For other Bank projects Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) are prepared centrally in&#13;
the SDU o f the MOF and then consolidated for the donors by DBER. These FMRs do not&#13;
provide the necessary information relating to component-wise expenditure as well as correct&#13;
category-wise breakdowns as this detailed knowledge lies with the implementing agencies. In&#13;
EQUIP, FMRs will be produced by GMUinM O E which will have adequate data, staff, and&#13;
systems. GMUwill consolidate and reconcile reports received from the PED'S and the SDU and&#13;
prepare quarterly FMRs. MOEwill submit FMRsto DBER for consolidation before submission&#13;
to IDAwithin 45 days o f the end o f each quarter.&#13;
&#13;
27.    Quarterly FMRswill show: (a) sources and uses o f hnds by disbursement category and&#13;
project component; (b) physical progress; and (c) status o fprocurement activities. The FMR&#13;
format has been agreed at program negotiations. Annual program accounts will be consolidated&#13;
centrally inthe Treasury Department supported by the Financial Management Agent.&#13;
Consolidated project financial statements will be prepared for all sources and uses o f funds.&#13;
GMUinMOEwill undertake a monthly reconciliation process to address variations between&#13;
FMRsand annual financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
28.    Formats will need to be designed for reporting on statement o f expenditures, advances on&#13;
School Grants, and subsequent payment requests. Inaddition, formats will need to be developed&#13;
for reporting to GMUon the physical progress o f School Grants. These formats would form a&#13;
integral part o f the Project ImplementationManual. Use o f these procedureswill allow for&#13;
adequate recording and reporting o fprogram expenditures.&#13;

Risks&#13;
&#13;
30.     EQUIPis the second development project, after the Afghanistan StabilizationProgram,&#13;
to adopt the govemment's funds flow mechanism for the operational budget. This program&#13;
assumes that the Financial Management, Audit, and Procurement Agents are inplace to ensure&#13;
fiduciary financial accountability for project funds. There is a risk pertaining to understanding&#13;
and functioning o f procedures at all levels by the various agencies involved. Adequate&#13;
orientation and training by SDUand testing o f these procedures through a pilot project in&#13;
Badakhshan will identify and mitigate this risk to a large extent.&#13;

&#13;
3 1.    Financing Percentage. Since the collection o f tax revenues hasjust begun and i s&#13;
sporadic, disbursement percentages have beenset at 100percent with the understanding,&#13;
however, that M O F will submit withdrawal applications on a net-of-tax basis. IDA will&#13;
periodically review the tax structure of the govemment, and decide whether standard&#13;
disbursementpercentages need to be amended and financing percentages amended accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
32.     Disbursement Method. Disbursements from the IDA grant will be transaction-based&#13;
(replenishment, reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under special commitments) with&#13;
fulldocumentationor against statements o fexpenditures as appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
33.     Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements will be made on the basis o f&#13;
SOEs for: (a) contracts for civil works costing less than US$400,000 equivalent; (b) contracts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for goods costing less than US$ 100,000 equivalent; (c) contracts for individual consultants&#13;
costing less than US$ 50,000 equivalent; (d) contracts for consultant firms and engineering&#13;
support costing less than US$ 100,000 equivalent, and (e) all training, audits, workshops, and&#13;
incremental operating expenses.&#13;
&#13;
34.     Special Account. A Special Account will be opened and maintained inD a Afghanistan&#13;
Bank or a commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. This account will be&#13;
operated by the Treasury Department o f MOF inaccordance with IDA'Soperational policies.&#13;
All payment requests for withdrawals to be made from the Special Account will be initiatedby&#13;
the MOE. The authorized allocation o f the Special Account will be set not to exceed US$2.6&#13;
million.&#13;
&#13;
35.    Minimum application size. Applications for replenishment o fthe Special Account will&#13;
be submitted:(a) at least monthly, regardless o f amount; or (b) when the Special Account&#13;
balance i s reducedby 40 percent, whichever comes first. The minimumapplication size for&#13;
withdrawal applications for reimbursement, direct payment, or for applications for Special&#13;
Commitments i s 20 percent o f the authorized allocation of the Special Account.&#13;
&#13;
36.    Authority to withdraw Grantfunds. The Ministry o fFinance will retain the right to sign&#13;
and submit withdrawal applications to IDA,based on the requests received from the Ministry o f&#13;

SupervisionPlan&#13;
&#13;
38.     The financial management o f the program will need intensive supervision, with a focus&#13;
on the internal control arrangements andthe functioning o f accounting, financial reporting and&#13;
auditing. Supervision missions will also review compliance with established procedures and&#13;
controls, and monitor the training and development o f MOE accounting staff.&#13;
&#13;
39.     The FinancialManagement Specialist along with Counterpart Chief Financial Officer&#13;
(CCFO) and ChiefFinancial Officer (CFO)/Finance Manager will track progress to enhance the&#13;
financial management capacities of MOE, PEDs, DEDs, and schools. IDA will review the&#13;
capacities inorder to ensure that they are incompliance. The Financial Management Specialist,&#13;
along with CCFO and CFO, will look into the progress and adequacy o f the financial guidelines&#13;
to be developed under the project and will provide comments where necessary. The Financial&#13;
Management Specialist will also track progress beingmade by SDU and DBERto enhance&#13;
financial management capacities inexpeditingpayments, accounting, and reporting.&#13;

&#13;
Option I:    School Management Committee to execute the works by employing labor andby&#13;
             procuring the needed materials through shoppingby invitingquotations from&#13;
             local vendors; or&#13;
&#13;
Option 2:    The whole or part o fthe work to be awarded to qualified domestic contractors&#13;
             after invitingquotations (at least three quotations must be obtained).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Option 1:&#13;
&#13;
7.      Under this option, small works up to US$ 50,000 will be executed bythe School&#13;
Management Committee (SMC) and the committee will primarily be responsible for&#13;
procurement o f construction materials and labor.&#13;
&#13;
8.      A simpleprocurement plan for these works shall be developedby SMC andwould be&#13;
provided with the proposal to the District Education Department (DED). The plan must take into&#13;
account the itemsproposedto be purchased, quantity, estimated cost o f purchase for each item&#13;
and the preferred option for procurement process.&#13;
&#13;
9.       To assist communities with procurement as well as to monitor the economy o f goods&#13;
procured at the local level, the DEDwill develop and maintain a Standard Price List for&#13;
construction raw materials and labor pertaining to rehabilitation works. The Standard Price List&#13;
will include costs o fmost types o fitems purchased at the community level. The List shouldbe&#13;
obtained from authentic sources such as Ministryo f Public Works could be prepared by the DED&#13;
based on actual survey o f the markets inthe local area and should be updated regularly.&#13;
&#13;
10.      The School Management Committees will maintainproper records andpertinent&#13;
documents for all procurement done inrelation to the rehabilitation works.&#13;
11,     Direct Purchasefor Goods or Materials: Whenthe market price o f an item is less than&#13;
or equivalent to the unit price o f that item inthe Standard Price List and the total cost o fthat item&#13;
is less than US$ 1,000 equivalent, then the SMC can procure that item directly from a qualified&#13;
supplier.&#13;
12.     Local Shoppingfor Goods or Materials: When the market price o f an item i s more than&#13;
the unit price o fthat item inthe Standard Price List or the total cost o f that item i s more than&#13;
US$ 1,000 equivalent, then the SMC will invite quotations from the reputable suppliers and will&#13;
procure from the supplier offering the lowest price. The invitation for quotation shall indicate&#13;
the description and quantity o f the goods or materials, as well as desired delivery time andplace.&#13;
Sufficient time should be provided for submission o f quotations. Factors such as quality,&#13;
availability, and transportation costs must be taken into account indetermining the lowest offer.&#13;
Inorder to havewider notification, the invitation for quotationcan also be advertised throughthe&#13;
local methods such as, public announcement, by placing notices inthe common places,&#13;
announcement inthe community meetings, announcement duringJumma prayers, inthe local&#13;
newspapers or inthe radio, etc.. This methodwill also be used for purchasingmaterials that i s&#13;
not included inthe Standard Price List. Whether prices are reasonable will be ascertained by&#13;
comparing prices with the standard price list effective at the time o f purchase.&#13;
&#13;
13.     Hiring of Labor: The needs for skilled labor such as mason, carpenters, bricklayers,&#13;
painters, electricians, and plumbers etc will be estimated before the start o f the work. The&#13;
standard payrates for labor as obtained from Ministryo f Public Works or any other authentic&#13;
source should not be exceeded inany case.&#13;
&#13;
14.     Storage: Storage space must be secured against theft and waste o fmaterials. The School&#13;
Management Committee must balance the needto buy materials inadvance so as not to disrupt&#13;
the works against the shelf life o f perishable items such as cement. A stock record-keeping&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
system (including designating persons responsible for stock management, record-keeping o f&#13;
stocks in storage, and transfers o f materials to works) should be implementedwhere materials&#13;
are not kept on site, are stored for more than a day, or are allocated to a contractor. The store&#13;
keeper should be a personwho i s not involved inthe purchase o f the goods to be stored.&#13;
&#13;
Option 2:&#13;
&#13;
15.     Procurement of Works through Price Quotations: Underthis option, a selected&#13;
contractor will be responsible for completion o f the entire rehabilitation works. Inthis process,&#13;
the SMC will invite quotations fi-om the qualified local contractors andwill award the contract to&#13;
the one offering the lowest price. To assure competitive prices, at least three quotations mustbe&#13;
obtained from different contractors. The invitation for quotation shall indicate the specifications&#13;
o fworks, as well as desired completion time. Sufficient time should beprovided for submission&#13;
o f quotations. Inorder to have wider notification, the invitation for quotation can also be&#13;
advertised through the local methods such as, public announcement, byplacing notices inthe&#13;
common places, announcement inthe community meetings, announcement duringJumma&#13;
prayers, inthe local newspapers or on the radio.&#13;

&#13;
                     CONSTRUCTION OF EDUCATION FACILITIES&#13;
&#13;
Overview of the BuildingConstructionScene&#13;
&#13;
1.       After a prolonged period o fwar and widespread damage the re-construction process i s&#13;
underway inAfghanistan, albeit ina haphazard way. The construction industry comprises many&#13;
small entrepreneurs, who have returnedto the country after the turmoil, and a small number o f&#13;
larger firms now involved inbasic rebuildingworks inone way or another. The infusion o f&#13;
intemational agencies and other donor funding via their projects is also creating momentum and&#13;
placing demands on a still limited pool o f expertise and contractor capacity. Salaries andwages&#13;
for professionals and those with technical and artisan skills are beingbidup and are steadily&#13;
rising.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The industryis constrained bythe shortage o fprofessional andtechnical skills to design&#13;
and manage constructionprojects. Despite a growing private small scale consulting industry, the&#13;
main reservoir o f architectural and engineering expertise is still within government. Many o f&#13;
these government professionals are reportedly being employedpart-time inthe growing private&#13;
sector. Some o f the more experienced also have positions inconsulting companies and these&#13;
firms intum have direct association with construction companies including through ownership.&#13;
Skills, technology and management approaches are generally outdated and heavily linked to&#13;
reinforced concrete construction.&#13;
&#13;
3.       The availability of materials for typical reinforced concrete works does not seem to be&#13;
problematic. Local agents can reportedly meet the market demands for cement and steel&#13;
reinforcing bars and conventional steel sections principally from Russia, Pakistan, and Iran.&#13;
However, timber i s invery short supply, and the local supply o f poles used intraditional roof&#13;
construction i s tight. Better quality timber i s costly and imported from Russia. Fabrication&#13;
facilities for steel buildingmaterials are available but on a small scale.&#13;
&#13;
School FacilitiesSituation&#13;
&#13;
4.       MOE data shows that 7,145 government registered schools existing at present in&#13;
Afghanistan's 34 provinces and that almost all need some kindo f construction, whether addition&#13;
o f new classrooms, rehabilitation or repair. Many schools are operating intents and have no&#13;
permanent buildings. InLogar province, for example, out o f 171 schools, only 17 have proper&#13;
school buildings and the others are operated intents, private houses and mosques. In2002, it&#13;
was estimated that the government-run schools formed about 70 percent o f all "leaming spaces"&#13;
inthe nation; other leaming spaces are non-formal schools, including community schools, home-&#13;
based schools, mosques and NGO schools. The non-formal schools are created, financed and&#13;
managed by local citizens.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Learning spaces constitute an important element for quality improvement ineducation.&#13;
There is little doubt that provision o f even minimumstandards o f classroom space at all levels o f&#13;
the system will continue to be anurgentchallenge for at least the next decade. In2002, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   39&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
numbero fchildren inschools was estimated at 3 million(Grades 1-12) including over-age&#13;
students, and 30 percent o f students were girls. However, gender disparity varied significantly&#13;
depending upon District; while the net enrolment ratio o f female students was 1percent in&#13;
Badghis, the share o f girls enrolment inKabul city was as high as 45 percent. The average size&#13;
o f school varies considerably betweenprovinces, from about for example 260 pupils inBamyan&#13;
to 772 inHerat and inexcess o f 1,500 inKabul City. Informal schools are also considerably&#13;
smaller. Giventhat the ideal approach would be to have girls schools within walking distance o f&#13;
the village and often within the community itself, schools tailored to attract girls enrollment in&#13;
rural areas may well need to be small and classroom spaces used for multi-grade teaching. Also,&#13;
given that 50 percent o f students enrolled inschools were inGrades 1and 2 in2002, the annual&#13;
demand o f classroom spaces will be very highover the next few years as the enrollment bulge&#13;
moves through the system to upper grades.&#13;
&#13;
Criteria for School Financing Eligibility&#13;
&#13;
6.      School Grantsfinancing will be used as far as possible to achieve education quality&#13;
improvement objectives. Grants are intwo parts (a) Quality Enhancement; and (b) Infrastructure&#13;
Development. Selection for part (b) will be from repistered government schools inup to ten&#13;
participatingprovinces and will beprioritized as follows:&#13;
&#13;
        (a) Girls' schools;&#13;
        (b) Schools with bothboys' and girls' shifthections; and&#13;
        (c) Boys' schools willing to open shifthections for girls.&#13;
&#13;
Strategy to Increase Provision of School Facilities&#13;
&#13;
7.      The government education system inthe immediate post war period was weak, it had&#13;
very limited capacity to plan and even less to implement. Government fund flow mechanisms&#13;
were basically non-functional. As a result, donor inflowsto the sector were routed extensively&#13;
through and directly managed by NGO's and other bilateral and multi-lateral programs. The&#13;
start-up o f these interventions has been difficult and slow and the combined output o f schools by&#13;
June 2004 i s estimated at a disappointing 169new units representing about 1200 classrooms. In&#13;
addition about 270 schools appear to have beenrehabilitated.&#13;
&#13;
8.      These approaches to school building, while well intentioned andperhaps appropriate ina&#13;
country emerging from crisis, largely bypassed the Ministry o f Education andhad minimal&#13;
impact on its capacity. Inthe meantime, the basic education structure has gradually become&#13;
operational. The administrative system is staffed at the provincial and district levels, butthe&#13;
technical capacity to support any substantial school buildingprogram is lacking outside Kabul.&#13;
The EQUIP strategy to increase school output over time is to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Promote the use o f community-managed school grants inten provinces to finance&#13;
        physical facilities inabout 250 targeted schools, and basic maintenancethrough&#13;
        education quality interventions in about 1,500 others;&#13;
    0   Create the necessary technical resources inparticipating provinces to guide and help&#13;
        communities to manage their school improvement programs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  40&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Seek early activation o f govemment financing mechanisms to allow provinces and&#13;
        districts to play an effective role inschool rebuildingand expansion; and&#13;
        Use NGOs to facilitate education capacity buildingat the local level.&#13;
&#13;
MOE Departmentof Construction(DOC) Reforms,andFacilitiesImplementationunder&#13;
the CommunityGrant Program&#13;
&#13;
9.      A t the provincial level, educational facility matters are at present nominally handledby&#13;
the Provincial EducationDepartment. These departments presently have very few engineers or&#13;
building-related professionals. Duringthe appraisal process for EQUIP, discussions were held&#13;
with the MOE's Department o f Construction (DOC) regarding its reform agenda andpossible&#13;
support to the EQUIP community school grants program.&#13;
&#13;
10.     For many years organized as a department that built schools throughout Afghanistan,&#13;
DOC i s currently beingreorganized to perform a technical advisory andbackstopping role. It&#13;
will be responsible for:&#13;
&#13;
        Setting up, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating standards o fphysical space,&#13;
        environment, and services for design, construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance o f&#13;
        schools and other educational facilities;&#13;
        Facilitating school planning andprogramming, and preparing maintenance strategies and&#13;
        plans at the provincial, district, and community levels;&#13;
        Preparing plans and evaluating/assessing plans received for donor financing;&#13;
        Coordinating physical facility planning, development, and research support for the&#13;
        Ministryof Education (survey, inventory, annual plans, etc.);&#13;
        Overseeing the management and implementation procedures o f the schools and facilities&#13;
        construction program o f govemment and donors;&#13;
        Supporting Provincial Education Departments with technical humanresources, guidelines&#13;
        and training, and technical backstopping;&#13;
        Prototype design, piloting, and in-situtesting o f innovations inplanning, design,&#13;
        construction, and associated processes and procedures;&#13;
        Preparationo f manuals and training packages for management, supervision, construction,&#13;
        and maintenance o f physical facilities.&#13;
&#13;
        The Department o f Construction (DOC) agreed to take on a technical role inoverseeing&#13;
and supporting the implementation and monitoring o f construction o f schools and other&#13;
educational facilities under EQUIP, working closely with the ten Provincial Education&#13;
Departments that are expected to be supported by the program. The following functional units&#13;
will be created:&#13;
&#13;
        Central Construction Coordination Unit: This will be a small unitheaded by a skilled&#13;
       professional on contract terms, and staffed by four or five professionals (one architect,&#13;
        one structural engineer, one facilities surveyor, one engineer trainer, drafting staff, and&#13;
       other support staff). EQUIP will fund technical assistance to the unit, primarily from&#13;
       regional and/or national sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  41&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       Engineeringsupport unitswithin provincial educationdepartments: Ineach province&#13;
       supported by EQUIP, DOC will form a small unit with at least one engineedarchitect and&#13;
       two/three technicians/supervisors and an office assistant. To ensure maximum&#13;
       coordination with the educational quality objectives o f EQUIP, the unit will be co-located&#13;
       with education quality personnel working on the school grant program. DOC recognizes&#13;
       the potential difficulty o f retaining staff at the new units and will make every effort,&#13;
       through selection and appropriate deployment from Kabul, to match staff preferences&#13;
       with their assignment locations. Staffingwill include new appointments and&#13;
       redeployment from within DOC. The technical staff will remain DOC personnel for the&#13;
       initial year. The effectiveness o f this arrangement will be reviewed at the end o f year one&#13;
       and the Ministry.&#13;
&#13;
Facility Standards and Design Options&#13;
&#13;
12.    Four variants o f school size, space standards, and construction systems were agreed with&#13;
MOE. The distribution among the four types covering about 250 schools is provisional until&#13;
survey data and SMC formation is available. The basic description o f each type is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
       a) Rural Basic: School Grants (US$ 16,000) will be made to about 10percent o f the&#13;
           target schools. These are remote schools where the communities choose to use&#13;
           traditional buildingmaterials for expediency. This approach will use the small&#13;
           classroom standard (4.3 x 7m) for a school with five rooms (three classrooms, one&#13;
           bookhesourceroom, and one teacher/principal's office/meeting room); it will use the&#13;
           traditional timber roof construction with limited strengthening for earthquake&#13;
           resistance. Walls could be traditional mudconstruction or pressure-moldedsoil&#13;
           block, fired brick, or stone inmudmortar. The school will be provided with latrines,&#13;
           water system where water i s available, boundary walls, and mat furnishingfrom&#13;
           within the grant. The requiredcommunity participation component will be at least 10&#13;
           percent o f the grant. Construction will be managed by the school management&#13;
           committee at the community level, following procurement andprice guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
       b) Rural Improved: School Grants (US$ 32,000) are expected to be made to about 60-&#13;
           70 percent o fthe target schools. These schools will use an improved classroom&#13;
           standard (5 x 7.5m) for a school with five rooms (three classrooms, one&#13;
           bookhesource room and one teacher/principal's office/meeting room). They will&#13;
           have a "double roof' flat structure with steel or concrete binder and appropriate&#13;
           uprightsandties for earthquake resistance, possibly combined with a traditional&#13;
           timber roofifdesired by the community. Walls will typically be fired brick, or stone&#13;
           inmudmortar. Other appropriate materials tested inthe initialpilot phase, such as&#13;
           stabilized earth blocks, may be used. Schools will be provided with latrines, water&#13;
           system, boundary walls, and furniture from within the grant. The required&#13;
           community participation component will be about 10 percent o f the grant.&#13;
           Constructionwill be managed by the school management committee at the&#13;
           community level followingprocurement and price guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   42&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       c)  Peri-Urban Conventional: School Grants (US$ 50,000) will be made to about 10-20&#13;
           percent o f the target schools. Construction will use the urban classroom standard (6 x&#13;
           8m) for a school with five rooms (three classrooms, one bookhesource room and one&#13;
           teacher/principal office/meeting room); it will use a conventional urban construction&#13;
           standard with steel or concrete for earthquake resistance. Walls will beblocks, fired&#13;
           brick, or stone inlime-cement mortar. Schools will beprovided with latrines, water&#13;
           system, boundary walls, and hmiture from within the grant. The required&#13;
           community participation component will be at least 10percent o f the grant.&#13;
           Constructionwill be managed by the school management committee, which will be&#13;
           requiredto publish notice for bids at the community/village level and to select&#13;
           contractors on the basis o f at least three quotations, as per procurement guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
       d) Urban Standard Conventional: School Grants (US$ 100,000) will be made to a&#13;
           maximum o f 10percent o f the target schools. These will use the urban classroom&#13;
           standard (6 x 8m) for a school with ten rooms (eight classrooms, one booWresource&#13;
           room and one teacher/principal's office/ meeting room); they will use a conventional&#13;
           urban construction standard with steel or concrete for earthquake resistance. Walls&#13;
           will typically be fired brick, blocks, or stone inlime-cement mortar. Schools will be&#13;
           provided with latrines, water system, boundary walls, and furnishingfrom within the&#13;
           grant. The required community participation component will be at least 10percent o f&#13;
           the grant. Constructionwill bemanaged by the school management committee which&#13;
           will be requiredto publishnotice for competitive biddingat the provincial level,&#13;
           among contractors approved by the engineeringsupport units within provincial&#13;
           education departments, as per procurement guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
13.    The first category o f schools i s not expected to be large innumber andwould be&#13;
primarily for remote locations where access i s problematic. Ifschools selected for the other&#13;
categories o f grant have a student population o f more than 500, they will be eligible for an&#13;
additional per capita grant for physical facilities improvements.&#13;
&#13;
Donor Education Facilities Activity&#13;
&#13;
14.    Several NGOs and donors support the work o f the Ministry o f Education. The Swedish&#13;
Committee for Afghanistan (SCA), CARE, InternationalOrganization for Migration (IOM),&#13;
USAID (Louis Berger Group), JICA, and UNOPS are engaged inbuilding andrehabilitating&#13;
schools. Some NGOs provide external support also to provincial and district education&#13;
departments for construction. At the level o f individual schools, communities have beenthe&#13;
main recipients o f external support.&#13;
&#13;
15.    According to the Department o f Constructiono f MOE, 600 new schools are under&#13;
construction. Few ifany schools have been built directly by provincial and district education&#13;
departments.&#13;
&#13;
16.    M O E i s currently reaching an agreement with the National Solidarity Program on&#13;
additional school construction.&#13;

&#13;
      MULTI-STAKEHOLDER TEACHER EDUCATIONPROGRAM (TEP)&#13;
&#13;
1.     The proposedEQUIPwill help to finance Afghanistan's Teacher EducationProgram,&#13;
which is a systematic and comprehensive approach to address teacher educationrequirements.&#13;
The program includes the development o fteaching standards and a unitary teacher education&#13;
curriculum as well as a national in-service training system and a national pre-serviceteacher&#13;
education system. The collaborating agencies for the program include the Academic Council on&#13;
Education, Ministry o f Education, Ministryo f Higher Education, Denmark, JICA, UNICEF,&#13;
USAID,the World Bank, andthe Teachers' College ofColumbiaUniversity.&#13;
&#13;
Vision&#13;
&#13;
2.     Teacher EducationProgram (TEP) i s looking at a classroom inAfghanistan inthe near&#13;
future. Students are interested, busyandmotivated. Students are doing creative work. Students&#13;
are solving problems and making decisions. Students are sharingknowledge with other students.&#13;
&#13;
3.     This is being facilitated by a teacher who:&#13;
&#13;
       I s competent and knows the subject s/he i s teaching&#13;
       I s following the M O E curriculum&#13;
       Can relate the lessons to the student's own lives&#13;
       Has a lesson plan anduses it&#13;
       Can manage the class effectively&#13;
       Can communicate effectively&#13;
       Can assess the learning needs o f students and respond to them&#13;
       Provides learning tasks appropriate to different levels o f learners&#13;
&#13;
4.     The community i s involved inthe activities o f the school andparents have formed a bond&#13;
with the teacher to support the students.&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
5.     The objectives o fTEP are to develop:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    8  National teaching standards;&#13;
    8  A unitary teacher educationcurriculum;&#13;
    8  A national in-service training system that provides continuoustraining and support for all&#13;
       teachers; and&#13;
    8  A comprehensive national pre-service training system, including institutional&#13;
       accreditation system, and individual teacher certification.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
InstitutionalArrangement&#13;
&#13;
6.       A small core team o f 8-10 Afghan professionals will be constitutedto develop the&#13;
Teacher Education Program. An external consultant will facilitate their work.&#13;
&#13;
7.       A situation analysis team will be assembled to rapidly collect/collate existing information&#13;
and data o f relevance to the effort. The core team will supervise this work, analyze the&#13;
information available, and draw implications for policy/program recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
8.       A national resource group o faround 60 experienced trainers, faculty members from&#13;
academic institutions, and NGOs will develop the in-service program and planthe development&#13;
o f teacher resource centers. Members o fthis group may be drawn from provincial-level&#13;
institutions that may be able to train the teacher resource center trainers. The national resource&#13;
group will train 1,500- 1,800 trainers from all over the country, preparing them to conduct in-&#13;
service training for teachers and to carry out continuous follow-up activities. The group will also&#13;
be responsible for monitoring the quality o f training at the field level.&#13;
&#13;
9.       All the above teams will report to an Advisory Committee, comprisingrepresentatives o f&#13;
the Academic Council on Education, Ministry o f Education, Ministry o fHigher Education, and&#13;
keydevelopment partners. This body will meet periodically to assess progress, offer&#13;
suggestions, and facilitate coordination as may be needed.&#13;
&#13;
10.      The trainers inteacher resource centers will be selected from among teachers andNGO&#13;
workers, on the basis o f an assessment conducted by the national resource group at the provincial&#13;
level. These trainers may be viewed as extended faculty o fthe provincial/district level&#13;
institutions, and their career development paths designed accordingly.&#13;
&#13;

In-Service Training&#13;
&#13;
12.     Given the urgent and massive need for teacher development, it i s critical to develop and&#13;
launch a rapid, high-impact countrywide in-service teacher training program. At present there&#13;
are around 125,000 teachers inplace, with some 40,000 posts yet to be hired. In-take o f the&#13;
existing teacher training institute is approximately 1500, which i s clearly inadequate to meet the&#13;
needs o ftens o f thousands o f teachers. This i s likely to become even more acute once new&#13;
curriculum and textbooks are inplace.&#13;
&#13;
Key Components of an In-Sewice Teacher Development Pvogvam&#13;
&#13;
13.     An in-service programwould comprise of four components:&#13;
&#13;
    0    Short training workshops at the district or sub-district level (located inthe Teacher&#13;
        Resource Centers) ;&#13;
    0   Developing Teacher Resource Centers to perform follow-up activities;&#13;
    0   Periodic teacher support materials; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   48&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    0   ImplementingSchool Improvement Plans (Component 1o fEQUIP).&#13;
&#13;
Short-term Training Workshops&#13;
&#13;
14.     Short but intensive in-service workshops that are experiential and participatory innature&#13;
tend to have more impact on teacher performance than longer academic and lecture-based&#13;
courses. It i s therefore proposedthat teachers be oriented through short, countrywide in-service&#13;
programs held simultaneously over two-three months inteacher resource centers at the district or&#13;
sub-district level. Trainers located at the centers could then devote the rest o f the academic year&#13;
to follow-up, including school visitdmentoring, monthly meetings o f teachers at the centers to&#13;
share experiences and helppeers, and distribution o fteacher support material as needs arise. A&#13;
yearly cycle o f a workshop plus intensive follow-up activities will be established.&#13;
&#13;
15.     A perspective plan could be developed for these short in-service programs, with different&#13;
years focusing on key objectives for systemic improvement. A sample o f such a progressioni s&#13;
indicated below:&#13;
&#13;
   Year 1       Focus on active learning pedagogywithin existing circumstances, acceleration o f&#13;
                learning and introducingnew textbooks / curriculum)&#13;
   Year 2       Focus on new curriculum and textbooks, strengthening subject understanding o f&#13;
                teachers&#13;
   Year 3       Focus on new curriculum and textbooks, increasingunderstandingo f classroom&#13;
                organization and planning&#13;
   Year 4       Focus on evaluation, planning, school management and community&#13;
   Year 5     I Focus on action research, to enable local problem solving andthus prepare&#13;
                ground for reduction inor phasing out o f centralizedtraining input.&#13;
&#13;
16.     Outcomes o f teachers' in-service training are expected to be measurable inclassrooms&#13;
and schools, usinga set o f sequenced indicators. Impact assessment will be an ongoing strand in&#13;
the training workshops activity.&#13;
&#13;
Teacher Resource Centers (TRC)&#13;
&#13;
17.     Teacher resource centers are proposedto be established for groups o f around 200-300&#13;
teachers each. The centers will require a space where meetings can take place and teaching&#13;
materials can be kept. A classroom inan existing school at district level may be used for this&#13;
purpose, or ifnecessary, additional space may be built as an adjunct to a school.&#13;
&#13;
18.     The major input required will be human resources, rather than physical space. The&#13;
centers will require the full or part-time appointment o f coordinators - drawn from among&#13;
teachers themselves - whose main functions will be to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Conduct in-service training workshops;&#13;
    0   Undertake follow-up visits to schools to enable teachers to put their training into practice&#13;
        effectively and provide on-site support as necessary;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  49&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   0    Organize monthly meetings to enable teachers to share their experiences, plan together,&#13;
        and provide academic inputs as necessary/planned, based on feedback from schools;&#13;
   0    Provide feedback from the field to pedagogic institutes, teacher training colleges,&#13;
        Universityo fEducation, the Teacher Training Department o fthe MinistryofEducation,&#13;
        and the Academic Council on Education, enabling them to undertake measures such as&#13;
        developing support material for teachers and conceptualize future training inputs.&#13;
&#13;
Periodic Teacher Support Material&#13;
&#13;
20.     Since no training program can take account o f all the (present and likely future) needs o f&#13;
teachers, it will be appropriate to use the feedback mechanism to decide on the nature o f ongoing&#13;
support. Teacher support material could be created and provided through the teacher resource&#13;
centers. The coordinators could also ensure that the material is actually read and used.&#13;
Similarly, radio programs being created for teacher training could make use of the feedback to&#13;
align themselves to teachers' needs.&#13;

         ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS FRAMEWORK&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
1.      The proposedEducation Quality Improvement Program (EQUIP) aims to improve the&#13;
quality o f educational inputs and processes as the foundation for a long-term strategy to enhance&#13;
the quality o f educational outcomes. This will be achieved through: (a) a focus on schools and&#13;
communities to strengthen their capacity to better manage teaching-learning activities; (b)&#13;
investment inhuman resources (teachers, principals and educational administration personnel)&#13;
and physical facilities; and (c) institutional development o f schools, DEDs, PEDSand the MOE.&#13;
The program also aims to promote education for girls by puttinga priority for female teachers&#13;
and students within each component activity.&#13;
&#13;
PotentialImpactsof Various Components&#13;
&#13;
2.      Activities under the program should not entail significant and negative environmental and&#13;
social impacts, provided they are designed and implemented with due consideration o f&#13;
environmental and social issues. Construction activities may cause limited, temporary, and&#13;
localizednegative impacts due to depletion or degradation o fnatural resources such as stone,&#13;
earth, water etc. used for school construction ifproper environmental management is not carried&#13;
out at design, construction and operation stages. This can be mitigated through the&#13;
implementation o f an appropriate social and environmental management plan. Capacity building&#13;
o fPEDS and DEDs including physical and institutional management, are likely to have a positive&#13;
impact on social andphysical environment.&#13;
&#13;
3.      OP/BP 4.01 is triggered because o f school rehabilitation activities. The project will apply&#13;
the principal Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (ESSF) for emergency projects in&#13;
Afghanistan. To limit the extent o fthese risks, the Framework provides guidelines and codes o f&#13;
practice for an environmental mitigation measures to be incorporated inthe design, contracting&#13;
and monitoring o f sub-projects, along with an implementation structure assigning responsibilities&#13;
to implementing agencies and their consultants, and a capacity buildingprogram for social and&#13;
environmental management. Interms o f social impacts, the project falls inthe S-2 category o f&#13;
the Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition, Entitlements, and Compensation (Attachment 2).&#13;
&#13;
4.      No land acquisition i s anticipated. Inthe current socio-political context, there is no clear&#13;
legal framework to handle involuntary land acquisition, and the local authorities do not have&#13;
access to funds to purchase landor other assets iflandacquisition was to be undertaken. Ifthe&#13;
govemment would attempt to acquire any land against the will o f those affected (land&#13;
owners/users), it would have a significant negative social and political impact. Hence,&#13;
involuntary land acquisition i s prohibited. Ifany minor areas o f land would be needed for a&#13;
school rehabilitation, such land could only be obtained through either private voluntary&#13;
donations, compensation paid by the community (Le. transaction between willing buyer-seller),&#13;
or from available government land. Private voluntary donations and community purchases would&#13;
be documented as requiredby the Framework, and for govemment land, documentationwould&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

be needed that the land i s free o f encroachments, squatters or other encumbrances, and has been&#13;
transferred to the project by the authorities.&#13;
&#13;
5.      The design for the project defines a strategy, which will ensure that ethnic and religious&#13;
minority groups are included as beneficiaries, and that their concerns are addressed in&#13;
compliance with the requirements o f OD 4.20. The key elements o f this strategy are: (a) the&#13;
project i s national inscale and coverage, and consequently reaches all the country's different&#13;
ethnic groups, prioritized on basis o fwhich provinces and districts have received less support in&#13;
the past, (b) the facilitated participatory planning process at the district and school level includes&#13;
an approach to strengthen the capacities o f communities and schools to manage their own affairs.&#13;
School Management Committees with participation and oversight from communities develop&#13;
and manage school improvement plans; (c) both internal monitoring and extemal independent&#13;
evaluation will assess the inclusiveness o f the School Management Committees and thus provide&#13;
information that would constitute basis for corrective actions, ifnecessary; and (d) independent&#13;
monitoringby civil society (NGOs and the press) will provide another mechanismto identify&#13;
cases where ethnic minorities would have beenbypassed or marginalized. The project&#13;
furthermore defines a clear-cut policy o fprioritizing female teachers, girls' schools and&#13;
enrollment o f girls inorder to address the widespread gender disparity inthe educational sector.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Ifone finds culturalproperty (archaeological artifacts) duringimplementation ofsub-&#13;
projects involving civil works, it will be reported to the provincial or district govemors, who then&#13;
will inform the Archaeological Committee.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Compliance with the safeguard provisions and the negative list will be ensured through&#13;
an environmental, social and risk screening procedure (check lists) required for sub-project&#13;
proposals, and by intemal input, process, and output monitoring, independent extemal&#13;
monitoring by consultants, and by Bank supervision missions.&#13;
Purposeof the Environmentaland SocialManagementFramework&#13;
&#13;
8.      Currently social and environmental management inAfghanistan i s suffering from critical&#13;
capacity constraints. Since there i s potential for adverse environmental impacts, albeit very&#13;
limited, from the proposed activities under the EQUIP,their mitigation andmanagement is key&#13;
to the wholesome rehabilitation and development o f the educational sector. Hence, keeping in&#13;
view the existingmanagement capacity, as well as the flexibility required with investments still&#13;
to be finalized, a framework approach is adopted for EQUIP. It allows for early identificationo f&#13;
potential adverse impacts, without the requirement o f rigorous analysis through quantification,&#13;
and also provides general policies and broad guidance for their effective mitigation, along with&#13;
codes o fpractice and procedures to be integratedinto project implementation. Consistent with&#13;
existing national legislation, the objective o f the Framework is to help ensure that activities&#13;
underthe proposed reconstruction operations will:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Protect human health;&#13;
    0   Prevent or compensate any loss o f livelihood;&#13;
    0   Preventenvironmental degradation as a result o f either individual subprojects or their&#13;
        cumulative effects;&#13;
    0   Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   53&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    0  Ensure compliance with World Bank safeguard policies.&#13;
&#13;
GeneralPrinciples&#13;
&#13;
9.     Recognizing the emergency nature o fthe proposed relief andreconstruction operations,&#13;
and the related need for providing immediate assistance, while at the same time ensuringdue&#13;
diligence inmanaging potential environmental and social risks, this Framework i s based on the&#13;
following principles:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  The project will support multiple subprojects, the detailed designs o fwhich maynot be&#13;
       known at appraisal. To ensure the effective application o f the World Bank's safeguard&#13;
       policies, the Framework provides guidance on the approach to be taken during&#13;
       implementation for the selection and design o f subprojects, and the planning o f&#13;
       mitigation measures;&#13;
    0  All proposedsubprojects willbe screenedto ensure that the environmental and social&#13;
       risks can be adequately addressedthrough the application o f standardized guidelines;&#13;
    0  Project design and subproject selection will aim to maintain regional balance, and equity&#13;
       between ethnic and religious groups, considering variations inpopulation density.&#13;
       Employment opportunities within the projects will be available on an equal basis to all,&#13;
       on the basis o f professional competence, irrespective o f gender, or ethnic or religious&#13;
       group. The widespread gender disparities inthe educational sector is addressed by&#13;
       various measures: (a) the in-service certificate-based training o fteachers will give first&#13;
       priority to female teachers; (b) construction and rehabilitation o f schools give priority to&#13;
       girls' schools, schools with boys' and girls' sections, andboys' schools which planto&#13;
       open up sections for girls. Inall projects which require consultations with local&#13;
       communities or beneficiaries, gender-separated consultations will be conducted to elicit&#13;
       the views o f the female population, along with that o f the male population. The&#13;
       establishment o f the School Management Committees should ensure a balanced&#13;
       representation o f women as well as local minority groups.&#13;
    0  Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified to meet the special needs o f&#13;
       these operations. Prior to approval by the World Bank Board, this Environmental and&#13;
       Social Safeguards Framework will be disclosed inAfghanistan inDari and Pashto, and in&#13;
       the World Bank Infoshop.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Responsibilitiesfor Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
&#13;
11.     The overall responsibility o fproject implementation rests with the MOE. A designated&#13;
Safeguards Focal Officer will be identified with responsibility for overseeing the implementation&#13;
o f the Environment and Social Safeguards Framework and Management Plan inthe MOE.&#13;
&#13;
Capacity Buildingand Monitoringof SafeguardFrameworkImplementation&#13;
&#13;
12.     The capacity buildingactivity will be implemented under a separate Technical Assistance&#13;
program for Social and Environmental management. As part o fthe social and environmental&#13;
capacity buildingthat will be provided for implementation o f IDA-financed operations in&#13;
Afghanistan, the Safeguards Focal Officer and relevant staff o f MOE and implementing&#13;
agencies/consultants will receive training inthe application o fthe Safeguard Framework.&#13;
Specialist training modules may be considered after an acceptable level o f base knowledge has&#13;
been established. Duringsupervisiono f the project, the World Bank will assess the&#13;
implementation o f the Framework, and ifrequired, will recommend additional strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
Consultationand Disclosure&#13;
&#13;
13.     This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework was developed onthe basis o f an&#13;
overall Framework for World Bank-funded reconstructionoperations which was prepared in&#13;
consultation with the principal NGOs and development partners participating inreconstruction&#13;
activities inAfghanistan. Prior to approval o f the project by the World Bank, it will be disclosed&#13;
by the Government inbothinbothDari andPashto, as well as English,and it will also be made&#13;
available at the World Bank's Infoshop. Since no other separate environmental or social&#13;
assessments will be prepared for activities under the proposed reconstruction operations, no&#13;
additional disclosure requirements will apply.&#13;

&#13;
         Guidelinesfor LandandAsset Acquisition,EntitlementsandCompensation&#13;
&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
1.     Land acquisition will be kept to a minimum andno personwill be involuntarily displaced&#13;
under subprojects financed bythe proposed emergency reconstruction operations. Subproject&#13;
proposals that would require demolishing houses or acquiring land should be carefully reviewed&#13;
to minimize or avoid their impacts through alternative alignments. Proposals that require more&#13;
than minor expansion along rights o f way should be reviewed carefully. No land or asset&#13;
acquisition may take place outside o fthese guidelines. A format for Land Acquisition&#13;
Assessment i s attached as Attachment 2(i).&#13;
&#13;
2.     These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate affected persons to&#13;
ensure that all such persons negatively affected, regardless o f their landtenure status, will be&#13;
assisted to improve, or at least to restore, their living standards, income earning or production&#13;
capacity to pre-project levels.&#13;
&#13;
Categorization&#13;
&#13;
3.     Based on the number o f persons that may be affected by the project (Project Affected&#13;
People, PAPs) and the magnitude o f impacts, projects may be categorized as S-1,S-2, or S-3&#13;
projects:&#13;
&#13;
    a. S-1 projects are those that will involve the resettlement of more than 200 PAPs and&#13;
       where a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must be produced. Such interventions will&#13;
       be ineligible for support under the proposedemergency reconstructionoperations.&#13;
&#13;
    b. S-2 projects are those which will involve the resettlement o f less than 200persons. In&#13;
        such cases, the following documentation is required: (1) a land acquisition assessment,&#13;
       (2) the Minutes or record o f consultations which assess the compensation claimed and&#13;
        agreement reached, and (3) a record o f the receipt o f the compensation, or voluntary&#13;
       donation, by those affected (see below).&#13;
&#13;
    c. S-3 projects are not expected to have any land acquisition or any other significant adverse&#13;
        social impacts; on the contrary, significant positive social impact and improved&#13;
        livelihoods are expected from such interventions.&#13;
&#13;
Eligibility&#13;
&#13;
4.     PAPs are identified as persons whose livelihood, land, structures or other assets are&#13;
directly or indirectly affected by the project. PAPs deemed eligible for compensation are:&#13;
&#13;
    a.      those who have formal legal rights to land, water resources or structureshuildings,&#13;
            including recognized customary and traditional rights;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    57&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   b.      those who do not have such formal legal rights but have a claim to usufruct right&#13;
           rooted incustomary law;&#13;
&#13;
   c.      those whose claim to land and water resources or buildinglstructures do not fall&#13;
           within (1) and (2) above, are eligible to assistance to restore their livelihood.&#13;
&#13;
Acquisition of ProductiveAssets&#13;
&#13;
5.     Land acquisition may take place through the following methods:&#13;
&#13;
   a. Voluntavy contributions. Inaccordance with traditional practices, individuals may elect&#13;
       to voluntarily contribute land or assets and/or relocate temporarily or permanently from&#13;
       their land without compensation.&#13;
&#13;
   b. Contributions against compensation. A contributor/asset loser considered "affected" will&#13;
       be eligible for compensation from the local community or alternatively from the&#13;
       Government. A PAP shall lodge hisher claim for compensation to the local community&#13;
       representativeshhura head and it shall be verified by the implementing agency. The&#13;
       claim shall be lodgedwithin 2 weeks o f completion o f the consultationswith the&#13;
       concerned community, and before project implementation begins.&#13;
&#13;
   c. Sales transaction. An asset owner will sell the asset on the basis o fprevailing market&#13;
       prices.&#13;
&#13;
6.     The proceedings for voluntary contribution, or contribution against compensation, should&#13;
be documented. The documentation should specify that the land is free o f any squatters,&#13;
encroachers or other claims. A format is attached inAttachment 2(i), which includes a Schedule&#13;
to be followed to assess any compensation claimed and the agreement reached.&#13;
&#13;
CompensationPrinciples&#13;
&#13;
7.     The project implementingagencies shall ensure that any o f the following means o f&#13;
compensation are provided ina timely manner to affected persons:&#13;
&#13;
       (1) Project affected persons losing access to aportiono ftheir land or other productive&#13;
           assets with the remaining assets being economically viable are entitledto&#13;

           Compensation for the lost assets will be according to following principles:&#13;
&#13;
           a. replacement land with an equally productive plot, cash or other equivalent&#13;
               productive assets;&#13;
           b. materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures that will be demolished;&#13;
           c. replacement o f damaged or lost crops andtrees, at market value;&#13;
           d. other acceptable in-kindcompensation;&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
            e. incase o f cash compensation, the delivery o f compensation should be made in&#13;
                public, i.e. at the Community Meeting.&#13;
&#13;
       (2) Project affected persons losing access to a portion o f their land or other economic&#13;
            assets renderingthe remainder economically non-viable, will have the options o f&#13;
            compensation for the entire asset by provision o f alternative land, cash or equivalent&#13;

&#13;
       (3) A copy o f the Contribution o fAsset Document or Compensation o f Asset Requisition&#13;
            should be passed on to the Provincial/District Judge who will certify the transaction&#13;
            and keep a record hereof.&#13;
&#13;
ConsultationProcess&#13;
&#13;
8.     The implementing agencies will ensure that all occupants o f land and owners o f assets&#13;
located ina proposed subproject area are consulted. There will be gender-separate community&#13;
meetings for each affected mantaqa/gozar (urbaninfrastructure) or village (other projects) to&#13;
inform the local population about their rights to compensation and options available in&#13;
accordance with these Guidelines. The Minutes o f the community meetings shall reflect the&#13;
discussions held, agreements reached, and include details o f the agreement, based on the format&#13;
provided inAttachment 2(ii).&#13;
&#13;
9.     The implementingagency shall provide a copy o f the Minutes to affectedpersons and&#13;
confirm indiscussions with each o f them their requests and preferences for compensation,&#13;
agreements reached, and any eventual complaint. Copies will be recorded inthe postedproject&#13;
documentation and be available for inspection duringsupervision.&#13;
&#13;
SubprojectApproval&#13;
&#13;
10.    Inthe event that a subproject involves acquisition against compensation, the&#13;
implementing agency shall:&#13;
&#13;
    a. not approve the subproject unless a satisfactory compensationhas been agreed between&#13;
       the affectedperson and the local community;&#13;
    b. not allow works to start untilthe compensationhas been delivered ina satisfactory&#13;
       mannerto the affected persons;&#13;
    c. ifmore than 200 persons are affected and require compensation, the subproject shall be&#13;
       deemedineligible for support under the emergency reconstruction operations.&#13;
&#13;
Complaintsand Grievances&#13;
&#13;
11.    All complaints should first benegotiatedto reach an agreement at the local&#13;
community/village level. Ifthis falls, complaints and grievances about these Guidelines,&#13;
implementation o f the agreements recorded inthe Community Meeting Minutes or any alleged&#13;
irregularity in carrying out the project can also be addressed by the affected persons or their&#13;
&#13;

                                   Protectionof CulturalProperty&#13;
&#13;
1.         Physical culture includes monuments, structures, works o f art, or sites o f "outstanding&#13;
universal value" from the historical, aesthetic, scientific, ethnological, or anthropological point o f&#13;
view, including unrecordedgraveyards and burial sites. Within this broader definition, cultural&#13;
property i s defined as sites and structures having archaeological, paleontological, historical,&#13;
architectural, or religious significance, and natural sites with cultural values.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The proposed emergency reconstructionoperations are unlikelyto pose a risk o f&#13;
damaging cultural property, as the sub-projects will largely consist o f small investments in&#13;
community infrastructure and income generating activities, reconstructiono f existing structures,&#13;
and minor urban public works. Further, the negative list o f attributes, which would make a&#13;
subproject ineligible for support (Attachment l),    includes any activity that would significantly&#13;
damage non-replicable cultural property. Nevertheless, the following procedures for&#13;
identification, protection from theft, and treatment o f chance finds should be followed and&#13;
included instandard bid documents.&#13;
&#13;
ChanceFindProcedures&#13;
&#13;
3.       Chance find procedures are defined inthe law on Maintenance o f Historical and Cultural&#13;
Monuments (Official Gazette, December 21, 1980), specifying the authorities and&#13;
responsibilities o f cultural heritage agencies ifsites or materials are discovered inthe course o f&#13;
project implementation. This law establishes that all moveable and immovable historical and&#13;
cultural artifacts are state property, and further:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   The responsibility for preservation, maintenance and assessment o fhistorical and cultural&#13;
        monuments rests with the Archaeological Committee under the Ministryo f Information&#13;
         and Culture, which has representation at provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Whenever chance finds o f cultural or historical artifacts (moveable and immovable) are&#13;
        made the Archaeological Committee should be informed. Should the continuation o f&#13;
        work endanger the historical and cultural artifacts, the project work should be suspended&#13;
        untila solution is found for the preservationo fthese artifacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Ifamoveableor immovablehistorical or cultural artifact is foundinthe countrysideofa&#13;
        province, the provincial governor (wali) or district-in-charge (woluswal)should be&#13;
        informed within two weeks, and they should inform the Archaeological Committee. In&#13;
        case the immovable historical or cultural artifact i s found ina city, the provincial branch&#13;
        o f the Department o fMaintenance o f Historical Values o f the Ministry o f Information&#13;
        and Culture should be informed within two weeks (art. 18). Ifthe find i s made within the&#13;
        center, the Archaeological Committee mustbe informed directly within one week (art.&#13;
        25).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   64&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Failure to report a chance find within the stipulated time limit will be punishedwith a&#13;
        fine or imprisonment for a period o f one week or up to one month (art. 72).&#13;
&#13;
        Ifsomeone intentionallydamagesahistoricalor cultural artifact, the culprit shallpay&#13;
        compensation inaccordance with the value o f the artifact plus be imprisoned for a period&#13;
        o f one month to ten years depending on the gravity o f the crime (art. 71).&#13;
&#13;
4.      Incase o fa chance findofmoveable or immovablehistoricalor cultural artifact, the&#13;
implementing agency i s responsible for securing the artifact from theft, pilferage and damage&#13;
untilthe responsibility hasbeen taken over bythe relevant authorities as specified above.&#13;
&#13;
5.      These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions inconstruction contracts,&#13;
when applicable. Duringproject supervision, the Site Engineer shall monitor that the above&#13;
regulations relating to the treatment o f any chance find encountered are observed.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Relevant findings will be recorded inWorld Bank Project Supervision Reports (PSRs),&#13;
and Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) will assess the overall effectiveness o fthe&#13;
project's cultural resources mitigation, management, and capacitybuildingactivities, as&#13;
appropriate.&#13;

                          Proceduresfor LandMine RiskManapement&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
1.       The following procedures are designedto respond to the risks caused by the presence o f&#13;
mines inAfghanistan, inthe context of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Community rehabilitation/construction works to be identified and implementedby the&#13;
         communities themselves (for small projects o f up to $100,000 each);&#13;
    0    Small and medium-size works to be identifiedby local authorities and implementedby&#13;
         local contractors (for projects up to $5m each);&#13;
    0    Works to be implemented directly by Government departmentdagencies, without use o f&#13;
         contractors;&#13;
    0    Large works to be implemented by contractors (for projects above $5m);&#13;
&#13;
2.       General comment applying to all following procedures: All risk assessment and clearance&#13;
tasks shall be implementedincoordination with the MineAction Center for Afghanistan&#13;
(MACA). These procedures may needto be amended inthe future depending on evolving&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
Procedurefor Community-ManagedWorks&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to community rehabilitation / construction works to be&#13;
identified and implementedby the communities themselves (for small projects o f up to $100,000&#13;
each).&#13;
&#13;
Overallapproach:The communities should be responsible for making sure that the projects they&#13;
propose are not inmine-contaminated areas, or have been cleared by MACA (or a mine action&#13;
organization accredited by MACA).&#13;
&#13;
Rationale: Communities are bestplacedto know about minedareas intheir vicinity, andhave a&#13;
strong incentive to report them accurately as they will carry out the works themselves.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Communities are required to submit a reply to a questionnaire regarding the suspected&#13;
presence o f mines inthe area where Bank-funded community-managed projects will be&#13;
implemented. This questionnaire should be formally endorsed by the Mine Action Program for&#13;
Afghanistan (MAPA). It will be a mandatory attachment to the project submission by the&#13;
communities and should be signed by community representatives and the external project&#13;
facilitator. Externalproject facilitators will receive training from MAPA. Financing agreements&#13;
with the communities should make clear that communities are solely liable incase o f a mine-&#13;
related accident.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  68&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.      Ifthe community certifies that there isno known minecontaminationinthearea, the&#13;
ministry responsible for the selection o fprojects should check with M A C A whether any different&#13;
observation i s reported on MACA's data base.&#13;
&#13;
    a   IfMACA's informationis the same, theproject cango ahead for selection. The&#13;
        community takes the full responsibility for the assessment, and extemal organizations&#13;
        cannot be made liable incase o f an accident.&#13;
    a   IfMACA's information i s different, the project should not go ahead for selection as long&#13;
        as MACA's and community's statements have not been reconciled.&#13;
&#13;
5.      If communitysuspectsminecontaminationinthearea.&#13;
          the&#13;
&#13;
    a   Ifthe communityhas includedanassessment/clearancetask inthe project agreedto be&#13;
        implemented by M A C A (or by a mine action organization accredited by MACA), the&#13;
        project can go ahead for selection.&#13;
    a   Ifthe communityhasnot includedanassessment/ clearance task inthe project, the&#13;
        project should not go ahead for selection as long as this has not been corrected.&#13;
    a   Mineclearance tasks mustbeimplementedbyM A C A or bya mine actionorganization&#13;
        accredited by MACA. Communities will be penalized (subsequent funding by World-&#13;
        Bank funded projects shall be reduced or cancelled) ifthey elect to clear mines on their&#13;
        own.&#13;
&#13;
Procedurefor Small andMedium-sizeWorks ContractedOut&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to small- andmedium-size works to be identifiedby local&#13;
authorities and implementedby local contractors (for projects up to $5m each).&#13;
&#13;
Overall approach:M A C A (or a mine action organization accredited byMACA) should provide&#13;
detailed information on the mine-related risks (either based on previously done and updated&#13;
general survey or on a new general survey) before projects are considered for selection. Only&#13;
project sites assessedto have a nil-to-low risk would be eligible for selection, unless they have&#13;
been deminedby M A C A or by a mine action organization accredited by MACA.&#13;
&#13;
Rationale: Neither local authorities nor local contractors have the capacity to assess the mine-&#13;
related risks in a systematic way, while they may have incentives to underestimate them.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Prior to puttingup a project for selection, a general survey should be camed out by&#13;
M A C A (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) to assess mine-related risks inthe&#13;
area of the project (this should include checking information available inthe M A C A data base).&#13;
&#13;
7.      IfMACAprovides informationsuggesting anil-to-low risk inthe proposedproject area,&#13;
the project can go ahead for selection.&#13;
&#13;
8.      The contract between the responsible ministry and the contractor will include a clause&#13;
stating that incase o f an accident, legal liabilitywould be fully and solely bome bythe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Procedurefor Works to beImplementedDirectlyby GovernmentDepartmentdAgencies,&#13;
Without the Use of Contractors&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to works to be implementeddirectly by Government&#13;
departments/agencies, without use o f contractors.&#13;
&#13;
Overall approach:M A C A (or a mine action organization accredited byMACA) shouldprovide&#13;
detailed information on the mine-related risks (either based on previously done and updated&#13;
general survey or on a new general survey) before works or installation o f goods/materials are&#13;
carried out in any given area. Work would only be allowed to proceed in areas assessedto have&#13;
a nil-to-low risk, unless they have beendemined by a mine action organization accredited by&#13;
M A C A .&#13;
&#13;
Rationale: Government departments and agencies responsible for providing services currently&#13;
do not have the capacity to assess the mine-related risks ina systematic way, and currently&#13;
follow a process o f consulting with MACA prior to carrying out activities.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Prior to carrying out work, the Government departmedagency will consult with M A C A&#13;
to assess mine-related risks inthe area (this should include checking information available inthe&#13;
M A C A data base). Ifnot already done, a general survey should be carried out by M A C A (or by&#13;
a mine action organization accredited by MACA) to assess mine-related risks inthe area.&#13;
&#13;
11.     IfMACA provides detailedinformation onmine-relatedrisks which suggest anil-to-low&#13;
risk inthe proposed area, the work canproceed. The Government would be solely liable incase&#13;
o f a mine-related accident.&#13;
&#13;
12.     IfinformationprovidedbyMACAcannot support the assessmentofanil-to-low riskin&#13;
the proposedarea (whether due to the presence o f mines or uncertainty), works should not go&#13;
ahead before M A C A (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) carries out the&#13;
necessary further assessment and/or clearance for risks to be downgraded to nil-to-low, based on&#13;
agreed fundingmodalities (clearance may be funded either under a contract with a Bank-funded&#13;
project or under existing donor agreements with the mine action organization).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  70&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Procedure for Large Works Using Contractors&#13;
&#13;
Applicability:This procedure applies to large works to be implementedby large contractors&#13;
(projects above $5m).&#13;
&#13;
Overallapproach:The main contractor should be responsible for dealing with mine-related&#13;
risks, incoordination with the UNMine Action Center.&#13;
&#13;
13.     As part o fthe preparationo fthe biddingdocuments, a general survey should be carried&#13;
out by M A C A (or a mine action organization accredited by M A C A ) on all the areas where&#13;
contractors may have to work (broadly defined). This survey should provide detailed&#13;
information on mine-related risks inthe various areas allowing for an un-ambiguous&#13;
identification o f areas that have a nil-to-low risk o f mine/UXO contamination and areas where&#13;
the risk i s either higher or unknown. The survey should be financed out o f the preparation costs&#13;
o f the biddingdocuments.&#13;
&#13;
14.      All survey information should be communicated to the bidders (with sufficient legal&#13;
caveats so that it does not entail any liability), as information for the planning o f their activities&#13;
(e.g., location o f campsites, access roads to quarries).&#13;
&#13;
15.      Dependingon the nature and location o f the project and on the available risk assessment,&#13;
two different options can be used.&#13;
&#13;
Option 1-Mine clearance activities are part of the general contract&#13;
&#13;
         a. Based on the general survey results, a specific budget provision for mine action&#13;
             duringconstruction is set aside as a separateprovisional sum inthe tender documents&#13;
              for the general contract. As a separately identified itemintheir bid, the bidders&#13;
              include a provision for a further detailed mine assessment and clearance during&#13;
              construction.&#13;
&#13;
         b. On the instruction o fthe Supervision Engineer and drawing onthe specific&#13;
             provisional sum for mine action inthe contract, the contractor uses one o f several&#13;
              nominated sub-contractors (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) to be&#13;
              rapidly available on call, to carry out assessment prior to initiation o f physical works&#13;
              inpotentially contaminatedareas, andto conduct clearance tasks as he findsmaybe&#13;
              needed. The Contractor may also hire an international specialist to assist him in&#13;
              preparing and supervising these tasks. The Contractor i s free to chose which o fthe&#13;
              accredited sub-contractors to use, andhe is fully responsible for the quality o fthe&#13;
              works and i s solely liable incase o f accident after an area has been demined.&#13;
&#13;
         c. To avoid an "over-use" o f the budgetprovision, the Contractor i s required to inform&#13;
              the Supervision Engineer inwriting (with a clear justification o f the works to be&#13;
              carried out) well inadvance o fmobilizingthe mine-clearing team. The Supervision&#13;
              Engineer has the capacity to object to such works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     71&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Option 2 - Mine clearance activities are carried out under a separate contract&#13;
&#13;
       a. Specific, separately-awarded contracts are issued for further surveying and/or clearing&#13;
           o f areas with a not-nil-to-low risk (under the supervision o f the Engineer) by&#13;
           specialized contractors (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA). The&#13;
           definition o f the areas to be further surveyedcleared should be limitedto those areas&#13;
           where any contractor would have to work, and should not include areas such as camp&#13;
           sites and quarriedmaterial sites which are to be identified by the Contractor during&#13;
           and after bidding o f the works. As a result o f these further surveys and possibly&#13;
           clearance works, mine-related risk inthe entire contract area i s downgradedto nil-to-&#13;
           low.&#13;
&#13;
       b. The contract with the general Contractor specifies the extent o fthe portion o fthe&#13;
           construction site o fwhich the Contractor is to be given possession from time to time,&#13;
           clearly indicating restrictions o f access to areas where the mine risk i s not nil-to-low.&#13;
           It also indicates the target dates at which these areas will be accessible. Following&#13;
           receipt o f the notice to commence works from the Engineer, the Contractor can start&#13;
           work inall other areas.&#13;
&#13;
       c. The general Contractor i s invitedto include inits bidan amount for mine-security, to&#13;
            cover any additional survey / clearance he may feel necessary to undertake the works.&#13;
&#13;
Incase o fan accident, a Boardo fInquiryis assembledbyM A C Ato investigateonthe causeso f&#13;
the accident and determine liabilities. Largepenalties shouldbe applied onthe Contractor ifthe&#13;
Board determines that the accident resulted from a breach o f safety rules.&#13;
&#13;
All parties involved inthis process are requiredto closely coordinatewith M A C A andto provide&#13;
the Government, local communities, MACA, as well as any interested party the full available&#13;
information on mine-related risks that may reasonably be required (e.g., maps o f identified&#13;
minefields,assessments for specific areas).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

            Afghanistan - Education Quality Improvement
            Program Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The project aims to improve the quality
            of educational inputs and processes as the foundation for a
            long-term strategy to enhance the quality of educational
            outcomes. This will be achieved through: (a) a focus on
            schools and communities to strengthen their capacity to
            better manage teaching-learning activities; (b) investment
            in human resources (teachers, principals and educational
            administration personnel), and physical facilities; and (c)
            institutional development of schools, District Education
            Departments (DEDs), Provincial Education Departments (PEDs)
            and the Ministry of Education (MOE). The program also aims
            to promote education for girls by putting a priority for
            female teachers and students within each component activity.
            To achieve the objective, the program would finance the
            following components: (1) Grants to schools for: (a) quality
            enhancement; and (b) infrastructure development; (2) Support
            to schools through human resources development and
            institution building for: (a) teacher development programs;
            (b) school principal selection and training; and (c)
            capacity building of PEDS and DEDs to strengthen their
            school support functions; and (3) Support for policy
            development and monitoring and evaluation.
