RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:           The Kingdom of Nepal&#13;
Beneficiary:        Nepal Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board&#13;
Amount:              SDR12.8 million (US$18.28 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms.               Standard IDA Terms, with 40 years maturity&#13;
Commitment fee:    Standard (a variable rate between 0 and 0.5% of the undisbursed credit&#13;
balance, set annually by the Executive Directors of IDA)&#13;
Project description:  The proposed project would have three main components. The first is the&#13;
establishment and operation of the Nepal Rural Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation Fund Development Board (the Board). The Board would be&#13;
responsible for selecting, using transparent eligibility criteria, support&#13;
organizations to assist communities to prepare and implement schemes,&#13;
appraising, selecting, and financing schemes which fulfill eligibility criteria,&#13;
and monitoring key scheme-related activities. The second component is the&#13;
selection and construction of water supply and sanitation schemes. This&#13;
component would include a community development sub-component&#13;
consisting of three main programs of activities to promote active participation&#13;
of the communities in all stages of the decision-making process for the&#13;
planning, construction, and management of their rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation scheme. These programns comprise capacity building activities&#13;
(community mobilization/organization and non-formal education), hygiene and&#13;
sanitation education to influence behavior and maximize benefits, and&#13;
technical support services to women to allow them to make productive use of&#13;
the time saved. The second component also includes investments in water&#13;
supply improvements (gravity flow systems, shallow and deep tubewells,&#13;
dugwells, and catchment protection) and a small community-based latrine&#13;
component lending money to households for latrine construction and building&#13;
latrines for selected schools and health centers to maximize demonstration&#13;
effects. The third component is institutional development and studies.&#13;
Institutional development will take the form of technical assistance to the&#13;
National Planning Commission and to the Ministry of Housing and Physical&#13;
Planning for monitoring and evaluation of overall sector performance. Studies&#13;
will be on sectoral issues such as methodologies for demand estimates,&#13;
identification of criteria for scheme selection and corresponding scheme cycle&#13;
in the Terai, special studies (low cost technology options, water quality control&#13;
at source as well as in home, health impact assessment), and preparation of a&#13;
follow-on project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
Poverty category:     Not applicable. Over half of project beneficiaries would be in the poverty&#13;
group. However the project is not specifically targeting poverty as it operates&#13;
with entire communities, based upon their demand for rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation services rather than incidence of poverty.&#13;
Environment           The project is rated Category B. The project is expected to have a net positive&#13;
category:             effect on the environment. Scheme pre-feasibility and feasibility studies will&#13;
be carried out prior to construction and will include an environmental&#13;
assessment. One of the scheme funding eligibility criteria requires that&#13;
scheme proposals include adequate provisions to mitigate any identified&#13;
adverse environmental impact.&#13;
Benefits:             The main project beneficiaries would be approximately half a million rural&#13;
inhabitants who would benefit from improved water supply and sanitation&#13;
services through both time saved collecting water and better health from more&#13;
and cleaner water, improved health knowledge, and better hygiene practices.&#13;
Women would also be major beneficiaries, through spending less time&#13;
carrying water, through being full members of the Water User Committees&#13;
responsible for the project at community level, and through specific&#13;
components designed to empower them.&#13;
Risks:                The principal risks of the project are that more time and effort than now&#13;
foreseen may be required to build capacity in NGOs, communities, and the&#13;
Board itself, implying a shortfall in implementation from the current forecasts;&#13;
and that outside pressures may prevent the Board from allocating resources in&#13;
a transparent fashion according to the objectives criteria agreed with the Bank.&#13;
As regards the first risk, the pilot project indicates that there should be no&#13;
capacity constraints.  Even if constraints were to materialize, the main&#13;
consequence would be that fewer schemes would be financed during the&#13;
project period. Intensive monitoring and evaluation are intended to highlight&#13;
any problems as they arise, and to enable the Kingdom of Nepal and the&#13;
Board to fashion appropriate solutions. As regards the second, political risk,&#13;
the pilot project provides little precedent as it was executed by the Bank, and&#13;
so could uphold transparent and objective criteria in response to outside&#13;
pressures. Only Board experience will indicate whether transparency can be&#13;
upheld. To mitigate this risk, the Bank would devote substantial efforts to&#13;
close supervision of this project, and especially to ensuring strict adherence to&#13;
agreements regarding application of eligibility criteria and Board autonomy in&#13;
engaging staff and setting its rules.&#13;

RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. THE RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR&#13;
Country BackEround&#13;
1.01     Nepal is a landlocked mountainous country with a population of about 21 million. It is&#13;
a country of significant human diversity, largely because of the difficulty of traveling between the&#13;
different regions. It is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a 1994 per capita income of&#13;
about US$200. According to Nepal Povertv and Incomes (World Bank, 1991), 40- 60% of&#13;
households are below the poverty level, depending on definition. Rapid population growth has&#13;
limited the benefits from increased GDP, and incomes have risen by only 2% per year. Poorly&#13;
endowed human resources are a major constraint to rapid increases in more productive&#13;
employment and hence economic growth. Education coverage and quality are poor and the&#13;
participation rate is low. About 26% of the adult population is literate (less in rural areas), and&#13;
literacy among women is 13%.&#13;
1.02     Population growth has declined and is currently 2.4% a year. Although the urban&#13;
population is increasing at over 7% a year, rural people, drawing their livelihood from agriculture,&#13;
still comprise about 90% of the total, and their numbers are rising at 2.0% a year. The above&#13;
factors imply that sector strategies need to address the problems of a predominantly poor,&#13;
overwhelmingly rural population for the next several decades.&#13;
1.03     A high incidence of water-related diseases contributes significantly to low productivity&#13;
in Nepal. Inadequate access to safe water supplies, combined with poor environmental sanitation&#13;
and personal hygiene practices, is among the leading causes of diseases such as diarrhea,&#13;
dysentery, worm infestation, and skin diseases. Water borne diseases head the list of causes of&#13;
morbidity and mortality in Nepal hospital statistics. Diarrhea is said to account for almost half of&#13;
all children's deaths (16% mortality rate, out of a total child mortality rate of 35%). Life&#13;
expectancy is low (54 years), and the infant mortality rate is estimated to be 107 per thousand live&#13;
births. Unreliable as the statistics may be, the situation they portray is worse than in most other&#13;
countries of South and East Asia. While life expectancy and infant mortality have improved over&#13;
recent decades, the extent to which this is due to improvements in water supply and sanitation is&#13;
unknown. Although advances in technology mean more diseases can be controlled by low-cost&#13;
immunization, no immediate breakthroughs are foreseen for water borne diseases, implying that&#13;
improved health requires improvements in water and sanitation facilities and more effective use in&#13;
the near and medium terms.&#13;
1.04     Rural productivity is also constrained directly through the high time cost of collecting&#13;
water, often more than five hours per household per day, in many hill and mountain areas. This&#13;
cost is rising as settlement extends into less favored areas.  Environmental degradation&#13;

(deforestation and drying up of sources, increased seasonality of sources, pollution) and&#13;
competition with other uses are causing water sources to deteriorate.&#13;
Water SuppyI and Sanitation Service Levels&#13;
1.05       Official statistics indicate that about 49%  of the rural population and 58% of the urban&#13;
population had "safe" water supplies in 1995, and 3% and 34% of the rural and urban populations&#13;
respectively had satisfactory sanitation arrangements. These statistics are seriously flawed. The&#13;
water figures refer to future populations covered by official schemes that exclude many&#13;
households with pnrvate supplies. Much of the urban water supply is intermittent, sometimes&#13;
seasonally nonexistent, and contaminated by human and animal waste. An official study showed&#13;
that 92%  of the 306 piped rural water supply schemes as of mid-1990 needed rehabilitation.' At&#13;
the same time, 25% of officially installed tubewells were said to be inoperative.2 Case studies&#13;
recently carried out by the National Planning Commission (see Annex 20) show that many official&#13;
schemes deliver no water at all, or deliver only to a minority of their target customers. Even&#13;
where clean water is available at the source, quality often is much lower within households&#13;
because of shortfalls in hygiene practices.3&#13;
1.06       Official sanitation coverage figures refer to households with latrines in rural and most&#13;
urban areas, and sewered areas in Greater Kathmandu. Sewerage operations are subject to major&#13;
shortcomings because of failures by households to connect to systems, leakage from sewers, and&#13;
failures to dispose of effluent away from the population. Open-air defecation is the norm in rural&#13;
areas and common in towns. Ignorance about the relationships between sanitation and health&#13;
means that the full potential benefits are not gained from available facilities. In bfief, access to&#13;
satisfactory water supplies and sanitation facilities is limited, many facilities do not or cannot&#13;
(without substantial additional expenditures and improvements in management) provide the&#13;
services for which they were designed, and even when facilities do operate, they are not used&#13;
effectively by the public.&#13;
Sector Institutions&#13;
1.07       The National Planning Commission (NPC) coordinates overall national and sectoral&#13;
planning, including annual development plans and budget estimates; the Ministry of Finance&#13;
(MOF) is responsible for allocation of annual budget resources. The Ministry of Housing and&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Physical Planning (MiHPP) has responsibility for formulating sector policies and plans. It chairs&#13;
the National Water Supply and Sanitation Coordination Committee, whose mandate is to&#13;
coordinate policy with the other ministries with sector responsibilities. The Ministry of Local&#13;
Development (MLD) oversees local authorities and is responsible for the integrated rural&#13;
development projects, many of which have rural water supply and sanitation components. Public&#13;
health, hygiene education, and promotion of on-site sanitation (latrine subsidies) are under the&#13;
Ministry of Health (MOH) Health Education and Environmental Health Sections. The Ministry of&#13;
Education (MOE) includes some health education in school curricula and non-formal education&#13;
classes. The Ministry of Water Resources is responsible for monitoring overall water use. The&#13;
Social Welfare Council (SWC) is responsible for registering, monitoring and coordinating the&#13;
activities of international non-governmental organizations and local non-governmental&#13;
organizations that operate in more than one district or are in receipt of funds from the Kingdom of&#13;
Nepal. Non-governmental organizations operating in a single district register with the Chief&#13;
District Officer (CDO).&#13;
1.08     Local authorities have been given responsibility for water supplies and sanitation.&#13;
Shortfalls in their performance, however, led to internal and external pressure to improve the&#13;
situation, and central agencies have taken over local responsibilities. The principal central water&#13;
supply and sanitation agencies are the Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC) and the&#13;
Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS), both of which report to the MIHPP. The&#13;
NWSC handles water supply in the 13 larger municipalities and sewerage in the three&#13;
municipalities of Kathmandu Valley. The DWSS is responsible for water services in 22 of the&#13;
smaller towns in Nepal (of which 16 have populations over 25,000) and physical implementation&#13;
of most government rural water supply and sanitation schemes. The Water User Committee&#13;
within the Municipality of Dhulikhel is responsible for water supply in the municipality. In 1988,&#13;
the DWSS took over the UNICEF-supported community water supply program from local&#13;
authorities and District Technical Offices under the Ministry of Panchayat and Local Development&#13;
(the predecessor to the MLD). Simultaneously, the DWSS was decentralized to five regional&#13;
offices and one office in each of Nepal's 75 districts.&#13;
1.09     Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play an important role in rural development&#13;
and rural water supply and sanitation. At least 19 international NGOs are active in the water&#13;
supply and sanitation sector. Among the most important are the International Red Cross, Water&#13;
Aid, CARE, Save the Children, the Gurkha Welfare Trust, Helvetas, and many religious&#13;
organizations. International NGOs are increasingly (for example, Water Aid, the Red Cross, and&#13;
World Neighbors) shifting from delivering services directly to assisting local NGOs to provide&#13;
services. There are presently about 3,400 local NGOs registered with the SWC, and perhaps&#13;
twice as many registered at district level. Local NGOs are mainly managed by volunteers, often&#13;
starting with a social welfare motivation. Some larger local NGOs now employ professional staff&#13;
to handle larger and technically more complex projects. Most NGOs are concerned primarily with&#13;
providing services to local communities (such as literacy, income generating activities, social&#13;
facilities, and local infrastructures) but several are delivering an increasing range of training,&#13;
research, and development activities to other organizations. Water schemes are a major focus due&#13;
to popular demand, although the number of NGOs with water or sanitation programs is not&#13;
known. Recently NGOs have exhibited an impressive ability to expand the scope and number of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
their activities in response to increased support from bilateral donors, and the Kingdom of Nepal's&#13;
policy to facilitate their activities (para. 1.16). Umbrella associations of NGOs are forming in&#13;
some districts to improve coordination among member NGOs and to help attract resources to the&#13;
district. Two national NGO federations have been established in the past four years to furnish&#13;
their members with services and to represent NGO concerns to government.&#13;
Government Policies and Sector Constraints&#13;
1.10     The Kingdom  of Nepal's overall sectoral objectives are to improve health and&#13;
productivity by making water and sanitation facilities available to the population as a whole.&#13;
These goals have remained constant during the last several development plans. The Kingdom of&#13;
Nepal has tended to define sectoral goals by estimating the investments required to close the gap&#13;
between the total population and the population with access to satisfactory facilities. Although&#13;
sectoral investments have risen both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the development&#13;
budget, coverage targets have not been achieved and have had to be scaled back. Thus in 1980,&#13;
at the beginning of the "water decade", the Kingdom of Nepal set safe water supply targets for&#13;
1990 of 94% for urban areas and 67% for rural areas, and sanitation targets of 21% and 13%&#13;
respectively. By rmid-decade, these targets were scaled back to 69%, 52%, 20%, and 10%&#13;
respectively, even though the share of development expenditures for water supply and sanitation&#13;
in the Seventh Plan (1985-90) was raised to 4.3% from 3.5% in the Sixth Plan (1980-85). Actual&#13;
performance in 1990 (66%, 34%, 34%, and 3%) fell short of the reduced targets except for urban&#13;
sanitation. The Eighth Plan (1992-97) sets targets for 1997 of 77%, 72%, 48%, and 9%, and&#13;
raises development expenditures to 5.5% of the total, of which approximately 62% is for rural&#13;
water supply and sanitation. It also foresees total coverage of the population with safe water&#13;
supplies within a decade, at which time there would be 25% rural sanitation coverage.&#13;
1.11     More important than the failures to reach coverage targets, however, has been the&#13;
failure of investments to generate satisfactory services, as noted above (para. 1.05). The Eighth&#13;
Plan highlights four causes of past shortfalls: overambitious targets; lack of institutions for&#13;
service delivery, especially in the rural areas; overly costly project designs; and excessive costs&#13;
due to delays in funding, inflation, and central procurement.&#13;
1.12     These deficiencies are largely institutional in origin and result from the inherent&#13;
inability of central institutions to deliver local services in a country with Nepal's diversity and&#13;
poor communications. The system under which every project was included in the central budget&#13;
was open to pressures at local and central levels to overprogram, and so implementation periods&#13;
were excessive. Projects were designed to fit centrally defined guidelines but there was no careful&#13;
review of local demands, facilities, or available resources. Large contractor-built schemes that&#13;
promised to cover the maximum number of beneficiaries (sometimes duplicating existing facilities)&#13;
were preferred, even when smaller schemes would have served better. Centralized procurement&#13;
of materials did not avoid lapses in quality but did cause delivery delays. Inadequate government&#13;
salaries and incentives led to poor staff motivation which resulted in inappropriate designs and&#13;
poor supervision of construction work carried out by contractors. Staff were not accountable for&#13;
the quality of work, and there were no systematic procedures to monitor performance. Frequent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
staff transfers damaged projects by removing staff knowledge, opportunities for using technical&#13;
skills, and personal responsibility for project performance.&#13;
1.13     Investments have also failed to provide services because of a lack of focus on the&#13;
technical, financial, and organizational requirements for operations and maintenance.&#13;
Communities are expected to maintain systems, but they are unwilling to take responsibility for&#13;
badly designed, poor-quality schemes. Efforts to enable communities to undertake operational&#13;
responsibilities have been lacking or deficient. For example, pumping schemes require electricity&#13;
and maintenance that cost more than the communities are prepared to pay. As a result, the&#13;
DWSS has had to take "temporary" responsibility for operation and maintenance. Without&#13;
adequate budget or personnel, however, the schemes deteriorated. There has also been little&#13;
effort to modify household behavior to reap the health benefits of improved supplies.&#13;
Coordination of extension activities by MOH village health workers with DWSS schemes has&#13;
been largely lacking.&#13;
1.14     To fill the gap created by the DWSS's poor performance in delivering services, many&#13;
NGOs have initiated programs to provide rural water supply and sanitation services. The success&#13;
of some of these programs contrasts with the poor performance of many DWSS schemes. The&#13;
experience of many NGOs and some bilateral donors, such as the Finnish International&#13;
Development Agency (FINNIDA), shows that better results come from alternative approaches&#13;
which avoid central interference in implementation and maximize community ownership of&#13;
schemes. Successful programs share certain features: first, more substantive interaction with&#13;
target communities at all project stages. Typically, private and NGO schemes have involved&#13;
initial community consultation on needs, health education (with a heavy emphasis, mostly by&#13;
international NGOs, on empowering women), significant community contributions of labor and&#13;
funds for construction, and total community responsibility for operation and maintenance.&#13;
Successful NGO schemes have involved a much higher degree of community trust and sense of&#13;
ownership than government schemes. Other important features are higher staff remuneration and&#13;
travel and subsistence allowances, high staff commitment to the objectives of projects independent&#13;
of remuneration, and links between tenure and adequate performance. The NGO sector has also&#13;
had some failures, of course, often related to lack of technical capacity or absence of the above&#13;
factors. The relative success of the NGO community-based approach has been successfully&#13;
confirmed by the Jakpas4 project (para 1.21, 1.22 and Annex 13), a pilot for the project proposed&#13;
here.&#13;
1.15     The MHPP and the DWSS have been aware of the shortcomings of their approach and&#13;
the successes of NGO alternatives, and are making efforts to incorporate these lessons in their&#13;
operations. The MHPP/DWSS Directives for Construction and Management of Water Supply&#13;
Projects, drafted in 1990 and revised in 1991 and 1992, requires that: (a) user conmmittees,&#13;
including at least two women and representing the community, formally accept responsibility for&#13;
operation and maintenance; (b) village maintenance workers be selected by the user committees;&#13;
(c) routine operation and maintenance be paid for by the users; and (d) capital contributions in the&#13;

form of labor, cash, or kind, be provided by the users. However, these efforts do not address the&#13;
adoption of an institutional culture that promotes accountability to the beneficiaries.  Not&#13;
surprisingly, preparation studies for the proposed project (Annex 20) indicate that implementation&#13;
of the guidelines has been patchy, with continuing emphasis on contractor-based schemes and user&#13;
groups being appointed on a pro forma basis. In early 1993, the Kingdom of Nepal responded to&#13;
the problem of staff discontinuity by setting minimum staff assignment periods of three years. The&#13;
DWSS has added new sections to its existing structure to deal with sanitation and community&#13;
participation.  These measures do not, however, address the inherent contradiction between&#13;
governmental structures (civil service rules, central finances, and a hierarchical structure reporting&#13;
to the capital) and the need to make officers responsible for service delivery accountable to users.&#13;
1.16     The Eighth Plan emphasizes the importance of institutional change through radical&#13;
decentralization of service delivery to local authorities and the private sector. The necessary&#13;
redefinition of government versus private, and government versus local authorities, as well as&#13;
associated resource reallocations, are difficult and uncertain. The Eighth Plan indicates that rural&#13;
water supplies are a local function, but also states that the DWSS will remain responsible for&#13;
gravity schemes serving more than 500 persons. Well schemes and smaller gravity schemes will&#13;
be handed to District Development Committees and the 3,995 Village Development Committees,&#13;
the private sector, NGOs, and communities.  District Development Committees will be&#13;
responsible for preparing district plans which give priority to low-cost schemes, and providing&#13;
coordination to avoid duplication of effort. In addition, all schemes, including government ones,&#13;
are to involve community participation at all stages from planning to operation and maintenance.&#13;
External FinancinE of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
1.17     About 30% of rural water and sanitation expenditures were financed by donors during&#13;
the 1980s (about 40% of total sectoral expenditures). The main donors in the rural sector from&#13;
1980-93 have been, in order of expenditures, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), UNICEF,&#13;
Finland, and the U.K., with smaller contributions from Austria, Japan, Canada, the Netherlands,&#13;
and the U.S.A. The World Health Organization has focused on planning, management, and&#13;
training, although its funding statistics are not available. UNICEF has been a catalyst in starting&#13;
community-oriented development programs, and has also recognized the need for an integrated&#13;
approach and introduced health and sanitation education through the involvement of women.&#13;
FINNIDA is currently supporting a project with the DWSS that should generate experience on&#13;
the costs and benefits of district-level water and sanitation planning. The ADB has financed two,&#13;
more conventional DWSS projects, although a third ADB project, approved in 1992, is helping&#13;
the DWSS to avoid past failures. Another ADB water supply and sanitation project (the fourth) is&#13;
under preparation. International NGO activity has been significant, both quantitatively and&#13;
qualitatively. The Nepal Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Review and Development&#13;
Plan (1991-2000) SRDP indicated that NGOs registered with the Social Welfare Council and its&#13;
predecessor accounted for 11% of the increase in rural water supply coverage during the 1 980s.&#13;
The NGO emphasis on community participation, defining robust mechanisms for operation and&#13;
maintenance, and complementary health and sanitation education, have ensured higher quality&#13;
than in public programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Previous Bank Experience&#13;
1.18      Most investment by the Bank in the water and sanitation sector has been in the urban&#13;
sector, with four credits totaling US$108 million to the NWSC and predecessor organizations.&#13;
Three are completed and the fourth, the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation&#13;
Project (US$60 million, Credit 2239-NEP, 1991) is continuing. Project performance audits noted&#13;
that the first three projects did not achieve most of their stated objectives, because of excessive&#13;
government control and lack of institutional autonomy; lack of adequate finances (cost recovery);&#13;
and insufficient institutional support to enable the utility to fulfill its investment and operational&#13;
responsibilities.  Similar problems with the fourth project led to suspension of disbursements&#13;
during most of 1995, although it is concentrating more on strengthening the management capacity&#13;
of the NWSC. Two studies funded by the UNDP and executed by the World Bank (NEP/86/010&#13;
and NEP/90/009, the second completed in 1992) assessed the feasibility of bringing water from&#13;
the Melamchi River through a 27-kilometer tunnel to a balancing reservoir on the edge of the&#13;
Kathmandu Valley for treatment before entering the distribution system. It concluded that this&#13;
investment would not be feasible without substantial financial and managerial improvements,&#13;
which in turn would depend upon increased de facto autonomy for the NWSC. Securing these&#13;
changes remains a major challenge for possible future urban water supply and sanitation lending.&#13;
1.19      International Development Association investments in rural water and sanitation have&#13;
been confined to three integrated rural development projects under the Ministry of Local&#13;
Development (MLD) with a total value of US$47.85 million, of which a little over 9% was for&#13;
community water supplies.5  Project Completion and Audit Reports6 indicate that schemes&#13;
suffered from poor construction and lack of maintenance. These problems, related to lack of&#13;
supervision, are often associated with complex rural development projects in remote areas that&#13;
take a supply - rather than demand - driven approach to planning and implementing facilities.&#13;
1.20      The Bank has been heavily involved in executing sector studies and management&#13;
support, financed mainly by UNDP. Among the more important institution-building activities&#13;
have been studies to plan human resource development for the DWSS (NEP/80/022), and the&#13;
Management Support Project (NEP/88/004 and 005), which, among other things, developed a&#13;
management information system for the DWSS. Feasibility studies (NEP/79/032) funded by the&#13;
UNDP identified 68 rural water supply projects in packages for three development regions, which&#13;
attracted investments from  bilateral and multilateral sources.  In addition to  studies for&#13;
Kathmandu Valley Water Supplies, the Bank has executed the Greater Kathmandu Drainage&#13;

supplies; Second Rural Development Project - Mahakali Hills (Credit 939-NEP, USS11 million), approved June 1979, closed&#13;

Masterplan Studies (under IDA Credit 1379-NEP) and the Bagmati Basin Water Management&#13;
Strategy and Investment Program (funded by the Japanese Grant Facility). The Bank has also&#13;
executed a series of studies and two grants from the Japan Grant Facility to carry out a pilot&#13;
project (Jakpas) whose objective was to field-test a variety of service delivery options, community&#13;
development approaches, eligibility criteria, and operating procedures for the proposed project.&#13;
The Jakpas experience is summarized in the following paragraphs and a detailed analysis of Jakpas&#13;
findings is presented at Annex 13.&#13;
1.21      The Jakpas pilot project has tested the main project elements by entering into&#13;
contractual agreements with 113 communities and 24 support organizations (NGOs, community-&#13;
based organizations, and private sector firms) to identify, prepare, construct, maintain, and&#13;
operate 113 Rural Water Supply and Sanitation schemes using a demand-driven approach. These&#13;
schemes are distributed among 18 different districts and cover an existing population of about&#13;
44,000. The Jakpas pilot project received funding from two Japanese Grants, together worth&#13;
about US$3.2 million. The 1 13 schemes were organized into two successive batches of 74 and 39&#13;
schemes.  Construction of 110 schemes is completed and the remaining 3  are still under&#13;
construction.&#13;
1.22      The main findings of the pilot project are as follows:&#13;
*  Demand and beneficiary willingness to contribute to costs: Strong demand for&#13;
water supply and sanitation services is shown by the fact that communities have&#13;
contributed, on average, 40% (in cash and kind) of scheme costs7 and 100% (in&#13;
cash) of the scheme's first year's operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs. These&#13;
contributions are in contrast with government schemes, where both capital and&#13;
O&amp;M costs are subsidized.&#13;
*  Existence and quality of support organizations:  There are enough support&#13;
organizations to implement the project. During the processing of the first batch of&#13;
schemes, however, support organizations were often technically weak and did not&#13;
always follow a participatory process. This led to more thorough review of&#13;
support organizations and their personnel during the processing of the second&#13;
batch of schemes, and also to more intensive monitoring of performance of&#13;
contractual agreements.&#13;
*  Timing of the scheme cycle: The originally estimated duration of the scheme cycle&#13;
(12 - 18 months) was too short. More time is needed for the community&#13;
development work required by the participatory approach, the technical activities,&#13;
and the processing of proposals. Allowing for the effect of seasons, harvests, and&#13;
holidays, on site accessibility, availability of local labor, and building conditions&#13;
had doubled the duration of the scheme cycle to 36 months.&#13;
7.    Scheme costs in this instance include all unskilled and skilled labor, all materials (local as well as non-local), and&#13;
transportation of materials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
* Eligibility criteria: The original criteria were found to be generally appropriate,&#13;
although improvements were possible. Experience also showed that criteria should&#13;
be clearly stated at the start of each batch of schemes and kept constant during&#13;
processing of that batch.&#13;
&#149; Management of the pilot: The pilot had to manage a large number of small&#13;
contractual agreements with communities and support organizations.  This&#13;
demonstrated that a few highly qualified staff could administer many agreements&#13;
by using efficient information systems, using local consultants to handle specific&#13;
tasks and peak period work demands, and employing clear criteria for scheme&#13;
selection and payment by results. Pilot experience has showed that a satisfactory&#13;
incentive structure is needed to motivate staff. Sufficient autonomy from outside&#13;
interference is also needed to ensure transparency in resource allocation to both&#13;
support organizations and communities.&#13;
1.23     The Bank has also assisted with sector policy analysis. As noted above, the 1986&#13;
Water and Sanitation Sector Study helped in formulating the strategy for the "water decade".&#13;
The SRDP of 1991 analyzed many of the past performance shortfalls, and recommended extensive&#13;
reorientation and strengthening of the DWSS to deliver better services by making more use of&#13;
community participation and coordinating more with local authorities, NGOs, and other&#13;
departments. The Water and Sanitation Sector Issues Paper, which had a draft circulated for&#13;
discussion with the Kingdom of Nepal in early 1993 (see Annex 20), was written after the&#13;
Kingdom of Nepal had clarified its decentralization policy and at the same time as the Kingdom of&#13;
Nepal's Commission on Administrative Reform was preparing its work. The Sector Issues Paper&#13;
took a more radical approach than earlier papers to institutional issues, placing less emphasis on&#13;
piecemeal improvements in existing institutions and more on the need to make structural changes.&#13;
Specifically, it emphasized the need to redefine and equip central institutions for those functions&#13;
which only they can carry out, such as monitoring, evaluation, and policy formulation. It also&#13;
supported the devolution of service delivery from government to independent local entities, and&#13;
reduction in investments pending institutional reform. This agrees with the March 1994 Country&#13;
Economic Memorandum  (CEM report No. 12281-NEP). The Sector Issues Paper provided a&#13;
basis for a wider dialogue between donors and the Kingdom of Nepal on sector strategy, and the&#13;
policy basis for the proposed project.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.24     The fact that investments did not provide sustainable rural water and sanitation&#13;
services has cast doubt on the role of public institutions in the management of the sector,&#13;
particularly in the direct delivery of services. This situation has been attributed to the Kingdom of&#13;
Nepal's line agencies taking a top-down approach, characterized by heavy political input and&#13;
overprogramming, inappropriate and costly designs, poor supervision of construction quality, and&#13;
failure to maintain completed projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
1.25     Water supply and sanitation improvements have been singled out in Nepal Poverty and&#13;
Incomes (World Bank, 1991) as important elements in alleviating poverty among Nepal's rural&#13;
poor. As noted above, many of the most critical challenges in achieving such improvements are&#13;
institutional. The Bank has played an important role through sector work and execution of&#13;
UNDP studies in assisting the Kingdom of Nepal to clarify the nature of the changes required.&#13;
Other donors substantially agree with the required changes, but they are not in a position to take a&#13;
leadership role. The proposed project would involve a major institutional innovation: creating a&#13;
new semi-autonomous institution (the Board) to help the government gradually reduce its role in&#13;
service delivery and transfer that responsibility to independent local bodies. In parallel, the&#13;
government agency now responsible for service delivery (DWSS) would gradually lose this&#13;
responsibility. For these reasons, support by the Bank would be to the project's success. By&#13;
establishing a new institutional framework, the project would support the Kingdom of Nepal's&#13;
commitment to improving rural service delivery and facilitate more suitable interventions by other&#13;
donors.&#13;
1.26     The project also supports the Bank's new lending strategy for Nepal, as outlined in the&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed at the Board on June 6, 1996. The CAS indicates&#13;
that poverty alleviation through growth is the overriding long-term development objective in&#13;
Nepal. In the shorter term, faster growth requires that public resources are used more efficiently&#13;
and effectively at the central and local level, and that more domestic and foreign private resources&#13;
are mobilized to build up the human and capital stock and provide social services.&#13;
1.27     The CAS emphasizes that our lending operations should be concentrated in a limited&#13;
number of priority sectors, including rural water, foster beneficiary participation and sustainable&#13;
use of natural resources, and help create a good environment for private investment. The CAS&#13;
recommends that our lending operations be simple in design because of the limited implementation&#13;
capacity of the government. The CAS also recommends that our lending operations should put&#13;
much more emphasis on a demand-driven approach to service delivery, involving beneficiaries in&#13;
the design, implementation, and maintenance of projects.  It particularly calls for women's&#13;
participation in beneficiary groups.&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
Proiect Ori2in&#13;
2.01     In the late 1980s, the Bank discussed a possible rural water supply and sanitation&#13;
project to be carried out on the conventional lines of the first and second ADB projects. The&#13;
Management Support Project (para. 1.20) provided a database on rural schemes and identified&#13;
about 300 DWSS schemes that required rehabilitation before they could be handed over to the&#13;
users. A study under the IDA Technical Assistance Credit 1379-NEP (subproject 13) reviewed&#13;
their feasibility and highlighted the need for appropriate mechanisms to ensure operation and&#13;
maintenance. Further processing was delayed until it seemed that an institutional environment&#13;
consistent with addressing this issue could be established, which took place after the revolution of&#13;
1990. The present project was identified in 1991 after initial drafts of the Eighth Plan showed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
that the Kingdom of Nepal wished to make fundamental changes in service delivery. Preparation&#13;
work (para. 3.01) has been carried out in parallel with the drafting of the Sector Issues Paper&#13;
(para. 1.23). Preparation studies were carried out by local consultants with funding by UNDP&#13;
and a Japanese Grant Facility (Annex 20). Two additional Japanese Grants were obtained to&#13;
field-test most project design elements through a pilot project, Jakpas, the Rural Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation Field Testing Project (see paras. 1.21, 1.22 and Annex 13) which has field-tested&#13;
delivery mechanisms which would be implemented by the proposed project.&#13;
Project Area&#13;
2.02     Given its demand-led nature (paras. 3.11 - 3.12), the project would net to be allowed&#13;
to operate wherever there is demand. For this reason, it would eventually cox  the entire&#13;
country. However, the project would mainly focus during its first two to three years on the&#13;
Central and Western regions, for three reasons. First, project implementation would initially be&#13;
constrained by the availability of qualified support organizations (NGOs, community-based&#13;
organizations, and private sector firms) to assist communities in project identification, planning,&#13;
implementation, and management. A preliminary review of support organizations indicates that&#13;
they are strongly represented in the Central and Western regions. Second, it is desirable that the&#13;
new semi-autonomous institution described in para. 1.25, the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
Fund Development Board (hereafter the Board), builds up its capacity by starting with a small&#13;
area which can be extended as experience is gained. Third, a review of coverage and planned&#13;
investment shows that the Central and Western regions need the project most.&#13;
Proiect Obiectives&#13;
2.03     The objectives of the proposed project would be to raise living standards in rural areas&#13;
of Nepal by: delivering sustainable health and hygiene benefits to the rural population through&#13;
improvements in water supply and sanitation; improving rural real incomes by assisting women&#13;
identify ways to earn income from time saved in carrying water; and improving governmental and&#13;
non-governmental capabilities to undertake and sustain these efforts.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
2.04     The project would give the Kingdom of Nepal a strategy to promote decentralization&#13;
and involve beneficiaries and the private sector more in rural water supply and sanitation service&#13;
delivery. To ensure that investments are sustainable the project would be demand-driven:&#13;
communities would lead in making decisions about the identification, design, implementation,&#13;
operation, and maintenance of their water supply and sanitation scheme. Support organizations&#13;
would help them. A main feature of the project is the creation of the Board.&#13;
2 05     The project would finance the initial operations of the Board. The Board would&#13;
allocate resources, on a grant basis, to selected partnerships between support organizations and&#13;
communities to finance the construction of rural water supply and sanitation schemes. It would&#13;
emphasize building up the capacity of local communities to lead the decision-making process in all&#13;
phases of scheme identification, design, construction, operation, and maintenance. The project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
would thus support activities to promote participation of community members, particularly&#13;
women, at all stages of the scheme cycle. The Board would ensure that support organizations&#13;
(Annex 14) and schemes met agreed eligibility criteria, provide funding to the partnerships&#13;
between support organizations and communities, and monitor performance. To keep its numbers&#13;
down to a few highly qualified staff, the Board would be assisted by service agencies. Service&#13;
agencies (Annex 14) are institutions and private groups that would provide services to the Board&#13;
in areas such as communications material production, material supply, training, technical site&#13;
appraisal, monitoring, evaluation, and special studies. The total coverage under the project, and&#13;
the rate of disbursements, would be driven by performance in achieving quality targets rather than&#13;
annual investment targets. Hence the project would replace the past top-down approach with a&#13;
demand-led approach. Agreement concerning the progressive phasing out of the DWSS's service&#13;
delivery responsibility has been reached during project negotiations. Under this agreement the&#13;
DWSS's service delivery activities would be phased out, no later than July 16, 1997, for the&#13;
Central and Western Development Regions of Nepal, no later than July 16, 1998 for the Eastern&#13;
Development Region of Nepal, and no later than July 16, 1999 for the Mid-Western and Far&#13;
Westem Development Regions of Nepal for communities with populations of less than 500, that&#13;
are funded by the Kingdom of Nepal's own resources.&#13;
2.06     A detailed description of the project is given at Annex 1. The various components of&#13;
the project are summarized below:&#13;
.  Establishment &amp;  operation of the   Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund&#13;
Development Board (US$4.98 million or 23% of total project costs). The Board&#13;
would have overall responsibility for oversight of the project. This component would&#13;
finance Board operating and capital costs, training costs for support organizations,&#13;
service agencies and communities, audits, and monitoring and technical assistance&#13;
costs.&#13;
*  Selection and construction of rural water supply and sanitation schemes (US$15.23&#13;
million or 72% of total project costs). This component would finance improvements&#13;
of water supply and sanitation services for 900 communities with a total population of&#13;
about 550,000. It would include community development activities, water supply&#13;
schemes, and sanitation facilities. Community development activities would promote&#13;
active participation of the communities in all stages of decisions about the planning,&#13;
construction, and management of their scheme, to increase local ownership and&#13;
effective use and sustainability. These activities are capacity-building activities such&#13;
as community mobilization/organization and non-formal education; hygiene and&#13;
sanitation education; and technical support services to women. Construction of water&#13;
supply schemes would include gravity flow systems (including spring protection),&#13;
shallow and deep tubewells, dug wells, and catchment protection.  Appropriate&#13;
sanitation facilities would be supplied to approximately 40% of project households in&#13;
the hills and 50% in the Terai. Grants, to be managed by the communities, would be&#13;
used for small revolving funds to lend money to households for latrine construction. A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
small institutional latrine component for selected schools and health centers would&#13;
maximize demonstration effects.&#13;
Institutional Development and Studies (US$1.04 million or 5% of total project costs).&#13;
This component would support: technical assistance for the National Planning&#13;
Commission and the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning to carry out sector&#13;
assessment and monitoring; a detailed demand study; a study to identify criteria for&#13;
scheme selection and corresponding scheme cycle in the Terai; special studies (such as&#13;
low-cost technology options, water quality control at source, and in-home and health&#13;
impact assessments) required to improve the capacity of the sector to deliver services;&#13;
and the preparation of a follow-on project. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained that the detailed demand study and the study for the identification of criteria&#13;
for selection of schemes in the Terai would be carried out in accordance with terms&#13;
of reference agreed with the Bank. Assurances were obtained that these two studies&#13;
would be completed by March 31, 1999 and June 30, 1998 respectively and that study&#13;
findings would be discussed with the Bank within 6 months thereafter and an action&#13;
plan prepared.  Finally, agreement was obtained that each action plan would be&#13;
implemented. Draft terms of reference for the above selected studies are presented in&#13;
Annex 2.&#13;
Proiect Costs&#13;
2.07     Total project costs, including contingencies, are estimated at NRs 1,382.00 million&#13;
(US$21.25 million). The foreign exchange component is NRs 260.44 million (US$4.02 million),&#13;
or 19% of total project cost. Taxes and duties are estimated at NRs 1.30 million (US$0.02&#13;
million), or 0. 1 % of total project cost.&#13;
2.08     The base cost estimates reflect prices in December 1995. They were based on the&#13;
actual cost of recent similar work carried out by Jakpas, donors, and NGOs, and recent&#13;
quotations from suppliers of materials and equipment. Total contingencies amount to NRs 420.57&#13;
million (US$3.98 million) and include a physical contingency of 9% and price contingencies of&#13;
14%. Cost estimates for consultant services are based on prevailing local and foreign person-&#13;
months rates. To provide for inflation during project implementation, the following escalation&#13;
rates have been used: for local expenditures, 7.5% in FY1996, 7% for FY1997 - 98 and 6%&#13;
thereafter; for foreign expenditures, 3.9% in FY1996, 2.8% in FY1997, 2.4% in FY1998, 2.5% in&#13;
FY1999 - 2001 and 2.4% in FY2002. Foreign exchange conversions have been calculated in&#13;
accordance with World Bank guidelines, using projections prevailing at the time of appraisal. A&#13;
summary of cost estimates is given in Table 2.1 below. Detailed cost estimates are provided in&#13;

Financine Plan&#13;
2.09       The proposed IDA credit of US$18.28 million equivalent would finance about 86% of&#13;
project costs net of taxes and duties, covering 100 % of the foreign exchange component and&#13;
about 83% of local costs. Beneficiary contributions in cash and in kind, valued at about US$2.3&#13;
million equivalent (11% of total project costs) would finance all unskilled labor, locally available&#13;
materials, portage, and some equipment and materials required for scheme construction. Funding&#13;
for an average scheme costing US$16,800 would be provided in the form of a grant from the&#13;
Board of about US$14,300 and a contribution from the community of about US$2,500. The&#13;
contribution from the Kingdom of Nepal, about US$0.62 million (3% of total costs), would&#13;
finance some Board operating costs, some scheme costs and some goods and equipment for the&#13;
Board. The project financing plan is summarized in Table 2.2 below.&#13;

The Kingdom of Nepal would pass on its share of the total project cost as a grant to the Board&#13;
based upon work programs agreed between the Board and the Kingdom of Nepal. The project&#13;
would provide grant funding for Board establishment and operations (US$4.98 million); selection&#13;
and construction of water supply and sanitation schemes (US$15.23 million); and institutional&#13;
development and studies (US$1.04 million).&#13;
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Status of Project Preparation&#13;
3.01     The project has been prepared in four stages. First, a UNDP-funded team of local and&#13;
expatriate consultants identified the project concept. Second, following the Kingdom of Nepal's&#13;
decision to proceed with more detailed preparation, a team (with some of the same members as&#13;
the first) prepared a detailed project proposal, with funding from a Japanese Grant Facility. Third,&#13;
a second Japanese Grant has, from March 1993, financed field testing of a trial Rural Water&#13;
Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board (commonly known by its Nepali acronym&#13;
Jakpas) to contract with private entities, including NGOs, in order to assist communities to plan,&#13;
implement, operate, and maintain rural water supply and sanitation schemes in a participatory&#13;
manner. Fourth, a third Japanese Grant has expanded the field testing until mid-1996. The field&#13;
testing has permitted us to finalize: (a) the draft Board Formation Order; (b) draft rules of the&#13;
Board Formation Order; (c) a draft Board implementation manual, including an operations&#13;
manual, a training manual, a monitoring and evaluation manual, a technical manual, a Board&#13;
accounting manual and an SO accounting manual, and a standard unit price system; (d) a 36-&#13;
month scheme cycle detailing all critical steps; (e) a management information system; and (f) unit&#13;
costs for all project components. The pilot project has also identified a pipeline of 108 schemes&#13;
for development during the first year of Board operation. Draft development phase contracts for&#13;
these schemes are ready for Board signing.&#13;
Organization and Manazement&#13;
3.02     The Board was created on March 14, 1996 through cabinet approval of a Formation&#13;
Order (Annex 4) under the Development Board Act (Annex 5). The MHPP will be the line&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
ministry for the Board. The Board's main objective is to promote sustainable, reliable, and cost-&#13;
effective demand-led rural water supply and sanitation services with emphasis on community&#13;
based approaches.&#13;
3.03      The Board will be managed by a Board of seven members, at least one will be a&#13;
woman. Four members will represent the public sector, with representatives from the National&#13;
Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Local Development, and the&#13;
Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning, and three members will come from the private sector&#13;
(including two members from NGOs). Board members will be selected according to qualification&#13;
and criteria defined in the Board Formation Order. The Formation Order indicates that for the&#13;
first two years of Board operation the Secretary of the MNHPP would be the Chairperson of the&#13;
Board. After these first two years the Chairperson of the Board will be elected by Board&#13;
members. The Formation Order stipulates that the Board may frame its own rules, provided that&#13;
it consults the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning on rules related to staff recruitment&#13;
procedures, salary, allowances, and other benefits. During negotiations, assurances were obtained&#13;
that the Kingdom of Nepal would take all action necessary on its part to enable the Board to&#13;
formulate and implement principles and procedures for the recruitment, employment and&#13;
compensation of its staff&#13;
3.04      Board staff will be independent of the Kingdom of Nepal's civil service rules and&#13;
regulations and will be recruited only on contractual terms through open competition and&#13;
according to qualifications and criteria defined in the rules. The rules define staffing, terms and&#13;
conditions of employment of Board staff (including salary and allowances), financial and&#13;
procurement regulations of the Board, and support organization and scheme eligibility criteria.&#13;
All staff will have well-defined responsibilities. Staff performance would be monitored regularly&#13;
and rewarded through an appropriate incentive system. The draft terms of reference for senior&#13;
staff have been prepared and would be attached to the draft rules. Draft rules were reviewed and&#13;
discussed during credit negotiations. Board adoption of rules satisfactory to the Bank would be&#13;
a condition for disbursement for schemes.&#13;
3.05      All Board operating procedures are further detailed and presented in the Board&#13;
implementation manual, part of the Board rules. The Board implementation manual includes an&#13;
operations manual, a training manual, a monitoring and evaluation manual, a technical manual, an&#13;
SO accounting manual and a Board accounting manual, and a standard unit price system. Board&#13;
adoption of an implementation manual satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition for&#13;
disbursement for schemes.&#13;
3.06      The Board will be responsible for Board policy and for monitoring its implementation.&#13;
All necessary powers to approve the budgets, programs, and plans, and to approve the selection&#13;
of support organizations and schemes would be conferred on the Board to allow it to work in a&#13;
flexible and fully accountable manner. The Board will be responsible for project implementation.&#13;
The Board will subcontract with support organizations and communities that meet eligibility&#13;
criteria (defined in the rules (Annex 6) of the Board Formation Order) to assist beneficiary&#13;
communities to plan and implement water supply and sanitation schemes that meet established&#13;
eligibility criteria. The Board will contract service agencies for activities such as project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
promotion, training, appraisal, monitoring and evaluation, research and development, and auditing&#13;
of Board accounts. It would also be responsible for administering all project-funded studies.&#13;
3.07     Secretariat.  Board policies will be implemented by its Secretariat, consisting of 30&#13;
staff They include six managers (the Executive Director, the Deputy Executive Director, and&#13;
four unit chiefs), four officers, six portfolio managers (as the number of schemes increases,&#13;
portfolio managers would increase to a total of fifteen), and fourteen support staff.  The&#13;
organizational structure of the Board is presented in Annex 18. The Secretariat would be headed&#13;
by the Executive Director (ED), who would be assisted by a Deputy Executive Director (DED).&#13;
The ED was recruited and appointed by the Board according to qualifications and criteria in the&#13;
Board Formation Order and its rules.&#13;
3.08     The ED, with Board approval, will recruit and appoint all professional staff according&#13;
to criteria established in the rules. In addition, a long-term technical advisor (for terms of&#13;
reference see Annex 17) with expertise and experience in institutional development, management,&#13;
and technical aspects of the Board's work will be recruited for a two-year period, and several&#13;
months of short-term technical assistance will be made available to assist the ED in managing the&#13;
Board's work program. During negotiations assurances were obtained that a qualified technical&#13;
advisor would be recruited by the Board before January 1, 1997.&#13;
3.09     The Secretariat will be organized into four units: the Administration Unit (including a&#13;
financial analyst and an accounts officer), the Program Development Unit (human resources&#13;
development specialists), the Technical Appraisal Unit (sanitary engineers) and an&#13;
Operations/Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (including a monitoring and evaluation specialist&#13;
assisted by a statistician or data specialist). Detailed qualifications are defined in the rules. The&#13;
Board will subcontract service agencies as needed to assist with portfolio management. At least&#13;
two of the six managers will be women to ensure that gender issues are addressed, and concerted&#13;
efforts will be made to involve beneficiary women in rural water supply and sanitation activities&#13;
for scheme sustainability.&#13;
3.10     The Board Formation Order provides the ED with full autonomy to manage its&#13;
program and personnel. The ED would be the ex officio secretary of the Board and is the link&#13;
between policy-making and execution. The ED will chair a technical appraisal committee which&#13;
will screen, select, and send for Board review and approval, support organization and scheme&#13;
proposals. The technical appraisal committee will consist of the ED, the DED, the technical&#13;
advisor, and four unit chiefs. In order to ensure proper coordination of activities at the local level,&#13;
the Board will require support organizations to inform concerned local authorities of scheme&#13;
selection. The ED is responsible for preparing annual programs and budgets to be reviewed and&#13;
approved by the Board. Once approved by the Board, these budgets will be reviewed and&#13;
approved by the National Planning Commission. The Ministry of Finance will subsequently&#13;
release funds to the Board on a grant basis. The ED will be accountable to the Board for overall&#13;
implementation performance of the Board. During negotiations, agreement was obtained that the&#13;
Kingdom of Nepal will make the proceeds of the Credit available to the Board, under a grant&#13;
agreement to be entered into between the Kingdom of Nepal and the Board, under terms and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
conditions satisfactory to the Bank, including programs requesting the Board to utilize the&#13;
proceeds of the Credit to provide grants to develop and implement rural water supply and&#13;
sanitation schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Formation Order, the rules and the&#13;
implementation manual.&#13;
Implementation Stratezv&#13;
3.11     Project implementation period. The proposed project will give the Kingdom of&#13;
Nepal a strategy to implement its policy of decentralized service delivery with greater private&#13;
sector involvement. For this reason the proposed project has a strong emphasis on institutional&#13;
development and testing an alternative service delivery approach. It does not intend to achieve&#13;
full coverage of water and sanitation throughout Nepal, but instead covers a five-year period of&#13;
sectoral investments (1996 - 2001). The project completion date is September 30, 2001. Scheme&#13;
selection will follow a demand-driven approach whereby communities would need to confirm&#13;
need, economic viability, technical feasibility, sustainability, and willingness to pay before they are&#13;
selected. The project will finance improvements in water supply and sanitation services for 900&#13;
communities in four batches under the implementation phase of the scheme cycle. The first batch&#13;
will cover 93 communities, the second batch 185, the third batch 260 and the fourth batch 362.&#13;
Given the estimated community dropout rate of about 13%, the project will need to prepare a&#13;
total of 1035 communities divided into four batches of 107, 213, 299 and 416, respectively under&#13;
the development phase of the scheme cycle. It is anticipated that the absorptive capacity of&#13;
support organizations will permit us to add up to 100 new communities to each batch. These&#13;
schemes would serve a design population of about 0.55 million, of whom about 0.39 million live&#13;
in the hills and about 0.16 million in the Terai. A mid-term review would be carried out during&#13;
the third year of project implementation to assess performance and redesign the project as&#13;
necessary. Assuming the concept and design adopted for the project are successful, funding has&#13;
been provided for a follow-up project to be prepared towards the end of the project&#13;
implementation period. The follow-up project, if it materializes, will probably seek to apply the&#13;
lessons learned from the proposed project, provide a framework to consolidate the institution (the&#13;
Board) created under it, and substantially increase rural water supply and sanitation service&#13;
coverage. A project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 7.&#13;
3.12     To  increase ownership  and  sustainability, communities, assisted  by  support&#13;
organizations, will plan, design, implement, operate, and maintain their schemes. The project will&#13;
thus be implemented by beneficiary communities, represented by Water User Committees (WUCs)&#13;
with support from  support organizations.   The community-based approach to  scheme&#13;
identification, design, construction, operation, and maintenance moves the emphasis from physical&#13;
infrastructure to community development activities in order to increase beneficiary participation in&#13;
decision-making, in implementing its decisions, and in sharing its benefits.&#13;
3.13     Scheme cycle.  The sequence of actions required from scheme identification to&#13;
completion has been defined within the scheme cycle (Annex 19). The scheme cycle takes into&#13;
account seasons, harvests, and holidays, and their influence on site accessibility, water source&#13;
yield measurement, availability of labor, and conditions and timing for construction work, as well&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
as the time needed to process proposals. The scheme cycle would span 36 calendar months and&#13;
includes three main phases (pre-development, development and implementation). The detailed&#13;
scheme cycle (tested and refined under the Jakpas pilot project) identifies 190 steps and their&#13;
respective duration.  The scheme cycle and its review process are described in the Board&#13;
operations manual.  The three main phases of the scheme cycle, and their objectives and&#13;
implementation details are described below.&#13;
3.14      The pre-development phase of the scheme cycle lasts about 13 months and begins in&#13;
October of any given year. Its main objective is to identify support organizations (SOs) and&#13;
schemes that meet eligibility criteria to enter into a development phase contract. The pre-&#13;
development phase includes the four following activities:&#13;
*  Pre-qualification of SOs: The Board Secretariat will identify SOs through a media&#13;
campaign which requests them  to forward their expression of  interest.  Once&#13;
applications are received the Board Secretariat would assess SO capacity, based upon&#13;
a review of their applications and field visits to assess their performance in previous&#13;
activities. After capacity is assessed the Board Secretariat would hold a technical&#13;
appraisal committee meeting to review whether all SO eligibility criteria (para. 3.24)&#13;
have been met before sending its recommendations to the Board for final SO pre-&#13;
qualification. Pre-qualification requires about four months and is completed by end-&#13;
January of the first year. At this stage the Board Secretariat assigns one of its staff to&#13;
follow all future contacts between the Board and the pre-qualified SO and its portfolio&#13;
of schemes. This person is called a portfolio manager.&#13;
*  Pre-feasibility study preparation and assessment. Pre-qualified SOs receive orientation&#13;
and training on how to prepare pre-feasibility studies, then prepare and submit their&#13;
pre-feasibility studies to the Board for screening. This process requires about 2.5&#13;
months and is completed in early April of the first year. The Board Secretariat then&#13;
holds a technical appraisal committee meeting to ensure that schemes meet Board&#13;
eligibility criteria (para. 3.26) to qualify schemes for site appraisal. Site appraisals&#13;
(including source yield measurement) of the selected schemes require another 2.5&#13;
months and are completed by mid-June of the first year.&#13;
*  Scheme Selection: The portfolio managers review the site appraisals, the technical&#13;
appraisal unit certifies the technical feasibility of the schemes, and a technical appraisal&#13;
committee meeting is held to propose a list of schemes that meet eligibility criteria for&#13;
final Board approval. This process requires about two months and is completed by&#13;
the third week of August of the first year.&#13;
*  Signing of development phase contract: After the Board approves the list of schemes,&#13;
the Board Secretariat starts a series of activities to facilitate SO preparation of&#13;
satisfactory development phase proposals. These activities consist of SOs training in&#13;
proposal preparation and screening and evaluating proposed SO staff, using a system&#13;
of orientation and training programs. The development phase contracts between the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Board and the SOs are then prepared and signed. These activities require about two&#13;
months and are completed by the end of October.&#13;
3.15     The development phase lasts about ten months and begins in November of the second&#13;
year. The cost of the development phase is about US$3,300 per community (equivalent to about&#13;
US$7.6 per capita). The development phase contract is a small contract of about US$16,500 per&#13;
SO (assuming that, on average, each SO works with five communities simultaneously), which&#13;
includes financing for staff, overheads, and two lump sums, one for the Sanitation Fund&#13;
(equivalent to about US$400 per scheme), the other to reimburse eligible SOs for their pre-&#13;
development phase costs (equivalent to about US$108 per scheme). For an average group of five&#13;
communities the SO will provide a team leader, a community development specialist who&#13;
supervises a community health worker, an overseer who supervises a community technician. The&#13;
main objective of the development phase is to prepare an implementation phase contract&#13;
agreement. The activities of the development phase are described in the terms of reference&#13;
attached to the development phase contract. The development phase include the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
*  Orientation and training for SO staff: This includes training on the preparation of a&#13;
community action plan to help beneficiary communities prepare an implementation&#13;
phase proposal, training for overseers, and training for the community technician on&#13;
household sanitation. This requires about one month and is completed by early&#13;
December of the second year.&#13;
*  Community action planning:  The community needs assessment is carried out.&#13;
Community development activities are carried out, including hygiene and sanitation&#13;
education (HSE), non-formal education (NFE), helping with legal registration of the&#13;
Water User Group, forming a representative Water User Committee, discussing&#13;
technical and service level options, and helping beneficiary communities to prepare&#13;
implementation phase proposals. Promotion and construction of household latrines is&#13;
started. These activities require about six months and are completed by mid-May of&#13;
the second year.&#13;
*  Finalization of implementation phase proposal: The community cash contribution is&#13;
collected, the community action plan is finalized, the detailed design is completed and&#13;
the implementation phase proposal is completed. The Board Secretariat carries out a&#13;
site appraisal, holds a technical appraisal committee meeting to review implementation&#13;
phase proposals' compliance with scheme eligibility criteria, and sends its&#13;
recommendation to the Board for final approval. These activities require about three&#13;
months and are completed by end-August of the second year.&#13;
3.16     The development phase would result in a registered Water User Group with a&#13;
representative Water User Committee (WUC), a community action plan which would form the&#13;
basis for the implementation phase proposal, community contributions to capital and operation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
and maintenance costs, and, in cases which meet all Board eligibility criteria, a tripartite contract&#13;
agreement among the WUC, the Board and the SO for implementation phase financing.&#13;
3.17     The payment terms within the development phase contract have been set to permit&#13;
close monitoring of SO performance and early identification of problems. All payments are linked&#13;
to the completion of specific tasks. The first payment of 30% of the contract amount (equivalent&#13;
to about US$5,000 per SO) is conditional upon the signing of the development phase contract,&#13;
evidence that the SO has opened a separate bank account for the development phase activities,&#13;
evidence that all SO staff have been appointed, and receipt of a copy of the letter informing the&#13;
District Development Committee (DDC) concerned of the development phase activities.&#13;
3.18     The second payment of 40% of the contract amount (equivalent to about US$6,600&#13;
per SO) is conditional upon evidence that all HSE activities have been undertaken in accordance&#13;
with the terms of reference of the development phase, procedures for the use of the Sanitation&#13;
Fund have been established and agreed within the community, the Water User Group has opened&#13;
its own bank account, the Water User Group has been legally registered under the Water&#13;
Resources Act, a representative WUC has been formed, and the community resource map, the&#13;
layout plan, the baseline health data, the time-sheets of the SO field staff, and the WUC meeting&#13;
minute book are kept and maintained by the community.  In addition to its regular field&#13;
monitoring visits the Board hires an independent auditor to carry out an audit of the development&#13;
phase contract after the second payment is made.&#13;
3.19     The third payment of 30% of the total contract amount (equivalent to about US$5,000&#13;
per SO) is conditional upon evidence that the SO has submitted a satisfactory implementation&#13;
phase proposal, including all required community action plans and endorsed by the entire&#13;
community at a mass meeting, all HSE activities have been undertaken, the village maintenance&#13;
worker, the village health promoter, and the WUC treasurer have been selected, the Sanitation&#13;
Fund has been used satisfactorily, and the time-sheets of the SO staff, the WUC meeting minute&#13;
book, and the Water User Group account book are satisfactorily kept.&#13;
3.20     The Implementation phase costs about US$13,000 per community, of which about&#13;
US$2,550 is contributed by the community in cash and kind and about US$10,450 is contributed&#13;
by the Board, equivalent to a per capita cost of about US$30.0 (current population).  The&#13;
objective of this phase is to construct the water supply scheme, continue latrine construction, and&#13;
complete training of WJUC and community members. The implementation phase contract is a&#13;
tripartite agreement between the community, the SO, and the Board. The implementation phase&#13;
begins in August of the second year and lasts about 13 months. Signing of the implementation&#13;
phase contract is conditional upon evidence of a satisfactory audit of the development phase&#13;
(para. 3.18), deposit of the community cash contribution to the scheme construction cost in a joint&#13;
community/SO bank account, and deposit of the community cash contribution to the scheme's&#13;
first year's maintenance in the community bank account. The implementation phase includes the&#13;
following activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
*  Training of SO staff and community members:  This includes the training of the&#13;
community technician, the village maintenance worker, the WIUC and tapstand groups,&#13;
and school teachers and community leaders.&#13;
*  Construction Planning:  This activity consist in the planning of the construction&#13;
activities, procurement of all materials and equipment and their transport to the&#13;
construction site. This activity requires about six weeks and is completed by mid&#13;
October of the second year.&#13;
*  Construction of the water supply scheme: All construction is carried out by the&#13;
communities in two stages with technical support and input from SOs and monitoring&#13;
by the Board. This activity requires about 6.5 months and is completed by early May&#13;
of the third year.&#13;
*  Sanitation: This activity consists of continuing to promote and construct household&#13;
and institutional latrines. It takes about five months and is completed by the end of&#13;
April of the third year.&#13;
-  Women's technical support services: This consists of an orientation on this program,&#13;
the carrying out of agreed upon activities and establishment of linkages with other&#13;
organizations. This activity requires about six weeks and is completed by early May of&#13;
the third year.&#13;
-  Source protection: This activity includes planting trees around the source area to&#13;
protect the source area from animal intrusion. It takes about four weeks and is&#13;
completed by mid-May of the third year.&#13;
3.21     The outcome of the implementation phase is the consolidation of all activities, a&#13;
completed and functioning water supply and sanitation schemes, and trained WlUC and&#13;
community members. The payment terms within the implementation phase contract have also&#13;
been set to closely monitor the performance of SOs and communities and identify problems early.&#13;
All payments are linked to the completion of well-defined tasks that can be monitored. During the&#13;
implementation phase two bank accounts are used. The first is a joint account operated by the&#13;
community and the SO, while the second is operated by the SO. The community and Board&#13;
contributions to the scheme's construction cost is deposited in the joint bank account, while the&#13;
Board contribution to the community development cost is deposited in the SO account. Three&#13;
payments are made to the SO account and two payments are made to the joint account as follows:&#13;
(1)  About 30% of the cost of community development activities is paid to the SO&#13;
account after the implementation phase contract is signed and all SO personnel&#13;
have been recruited. About 50% of the total Board contribution to scheme&#13;
construction costs (non-local materials, skilled labor, and transport) is paid to the&#13;
joint account upon submission of pro forma invoices for all non-local materials&#13;
for stage 1 of the construction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
(2)  About 40% of the total cost of community development activities is paid to the&#13;
SO account and about 50% of the total Board contribution to scheme&#13;
construction costs (non-local materials, skilled labor, and transport) is paid to the&#13;
joint account once: stage I of the scheme construction work has been carried&#13;
out satisfactorily; the non-local materials ordered have been delivered; all&#13;
community development activities (including HSE) have been undertaken; the&#13;
village maintenance worker is on the job; WUC construction management and&#13;
WUC treasurer training have been carried out; the Water User Group has&#13;
certified that all non-local materials have been delivered; scheme a'ccounts have&#13;
been kept; pro forma invoices have been received for all non-local materials for&#13;
stage 2 of construction; the Water User Group has certified that stage I&#13;
construction work has been completed; and  progress reports have been&#13;
submitted.&#13;
(3)  About 30% of the total cost of community development activities is paid to the&#13;
SO account upon evidence that: the scheme has been constructed in accordance&#13;
with contractual agreement; all community development activities are completed,&#13;
the village maintenance worker and the WUC have had refresher training;&#13;
complete scheme accounts have been submitted; and the community maintenance&#13;
fund has been replenished by the community.&#13;
3.22     To ensure economies of scale, single schemes would be avoided. Communities and&#13;
SOs would be encouraged to identify geographically clustered schemes for Board financing. Each&#13;
scheme would have site appraisals by the Secretariat during the pre-development and&#13;
development phases of the scheme cycle. The first site appraisal will take place in the pre-&#13;
development phase in the driest season (April - June) to confirm that appropriate yields are&#13;
available and to review scheme eligibility for development phase financing. The second will take&#13;
place during the development phase to review scheme eligibility for implementation phase&#13;
financing. From the pilot project, we assume a 13% dropout rate between the development and&#13;
implementation phases.&#13;
3.23     Two contractual agreements would be made, one for development phase financing&#13;
(between the Board and SO) and the other for implementation phase financing (between the&#13;
WUC, the Board, and the SO). The development phase contract would be signed at the end of the&#13;
pre-development phase, and the implementation phase contract at the end of the development&#13;
phase. The pre-development phase is not subject to any specific contract but its cost is paid to the&#13;
SO as a small lump sum  incorporated within the development phase contract.  During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Board will enter into arrangements with each SO&#13;
and communities under such terms and conditions as shall be acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.24     Support organization eligibility criteria.  The Board would select support&#13;
organizations according to the following criteria:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
* Evidence of legal registration;&#13;
*  Constitutional provision to engage in rural water supply and sanitation service&#13;
delivery and related activities;&#13;
*  Audited and certified accounts;&#13;
*  Proven track record of at least two years in participatory rural water and sanitation&#13;
and/or related community development activities; and&#13;
*  Staffing capacity to carry out the proposed services.&#13;
3.25      Each SO  shall be further evaluated by the technical appraisal committee (TAC)&#13;
concerning its track record and staffing capacity using a ranking system which is described in the&#13;
Board's operations manual. The TAC will use this ranking system to recommend the number of&#13;
SOs it needs to undertake the corresponding batch of schemes. Support organization eligibility&#13;
criteria will be revised by the Board as needed in light of experience. In addition, the adequacy of&#13;
the criteria will be formally reviewed and assessed at the end of the implementation phase of each&#13;
batch of schemes. They would then be revised or modified to reflect lessons learned. During&#13;
negotiations agreement was obtained that Support Organization selection would be carried out in&#13;
accordance with the above eligibility criteria. Agreement was also obtained that the Board would&#13;
review the adequacy of the Support Organization eligibility criteria at the end of the&#13;
implementation phase of each batch of schemes and that changes introduced would need to be&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.26      Scheme eligibility criteria. Each scheme accepted for Board financing would need&#13;
to meet eligibility criteria. These criteria would be applied at each phase in the cycle using&#13;
information available at that phase. During the initial operations of the Board, the three criteria of&#13;
need and economic viability, technical feasibility, and sustainability and willingness to pay would&#13;
apply. They are described below.&#13;
* Need and economic viability: this is satisfied if one or more of the following&#13;
condition holds:&#13;
(1)  The benefit/cost ratio is at least 1.5.8 This could be approximated at the pre-&#13;
development phase by asking whether the average time saved each day per&#13;
household would be more than 2 hours (for gravity schemes and deep&#13;
tubewells), 0.75 hours (for shallow tubewells), and 1.75 hours (for dugwells)&#13;
and whether estimated costs per capita were less than NRs 1,600 (for gravity&#13;
schemes), NRs 1,300 (for deep tubewells), NRs 230 (for shallow tubewells),&#13;
and NRs 1,000 (for dugwells).&#13;
8.     A benefit/cost ratio of 1.5 (rather than 1) is conservative and was chosen to allow some benefits to cover non-&#13;
quantified overhead costs of the Board, and to allow for contingencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
(2) The average water availability is less than 15 liters per capita per day and&#13;
costs are below the thresholds in (1).&#13;
(3) A majority of households are dependent upon heavily polluted sources and a&#13;
scheme could provide cleaner water by protecting existing sources in the hills&#13;
or improving existing sources in the Terai and costs are below the thresholds&#13;
in (1).&#13;
*  Technical feasibility:  this is satisfied if the proposed source is undisputed,&#13;
unpolluted, and yields at least 45 liters per capita per day (if there is no other&#13;
solution, and existing sources are heavily polluted or provide under 15 lcd, a&#13;
minimum of 25 lcd would be accepted) and if the scheme meets the engineering&#13;
standards and service levels in the Board's technical guidelines and criteria,&#13;
including measures to mitigate adverse environmental consequences (Annex 15&#13;
and Annex 12).&#13;
*  Sustainability and willingness to pay is satisfied if all of the following conditions&#13;
hold:&#13;
(1) The community's contribution to the capital cost covers all unskilled labor,&#13;
locally available materials, portage, and all additional costs for service levels&#13;
higher than those provided under Board guidelines, and the cash contribution&#13;
is at least 2.5% of the cast construction cost in the hills, and 20% in the&#13;
Terai.9&#13;
(2) The community has made satisfactory operations and maintenance&#13;
arrangements.  These include engaging a village maintenance worker,&#13;
establishing systems for collecting maintenance funds on a regular basis, and&#13;
paying the first year's maintenance cost in advance (estimated at 3% of total&#13;
construction cost in the hills, and 4% in the Terai).&#13;
(3) A Water User Group has been formed and registered comprising all&#13;
beneficiary families, and a Water User Committee has been appointed to&#13;
manage the scheme, with representatives from each cluster and at least two&#13;
women.&#13;
(4) All beneficiaries who wish to participate are covered.&#13;
3.27      The sustainability and willingness to pay indicators would be appraised before the&#13;
development phase, and cash contributions would be deposited and the Water User Group&#13;
registered before the implementation contract was signed. The performance of schemes in&#13;
achieving these criteria would be measured again at the end of the project to ensure their&#13;
9.    Commnunity contributions in kind would be valued using the market rate for labor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
continued robustness and applicability. The Board will revise or modify the scheme eligibility&#13;
criteria as needed to reflect lessons of experience, especially at the end of the implementation&#13;
phase of each batch of schemes, when they will be formally reviewed and assessed. During&#13;
negotiations agreement was obtained that Scheme selection would be carried out in accordance&#13;
with the above eligibility criteria. Agreement was also obtained that the Board would review the&#13;
adequacy of the Scheme eligibility criteria at the end of the implementation phase of each batch of&#13;
schemes and that changes introduced would need to be acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.28     Role of women. Women are the main users and managers of water resources, and&#13;
influence family sanitary habits through their central role in family hygiene, child care, and food&#13;
preparation. As women are the ones who fetch water, they value improvements in water supplies&#13;
more than men and so have a vested interest in keeping the system functioning. Carrying water is&#13;
one of the most arduous tasks in rural areas of Nepal and is done primarily by women and female&#13;
children. Women are responsible for all household chores related to water, such as collecting and&#13;
storing water, taking care of sources and distribution points, and working to construct them.&#13;
Women also decide whether or not to use a specific water point, given its distance and&#13;
accessibility. They do not participate much in development, however, because household&#13;
activities take up too much time, there is a low level of awareness, and they have limited control&#13;
over resources. Despite these constraints, programs in Nepal and elsewhere have shown that&#13;
women could be more involved in initiating and managing their own water supply systems.&#13;
Hence, project implementation strategy would focus on strengthening the role of women in all&#13;
stages of scheme cycle to increase their capacity and to ensure they fully participate in project&#13;
benefits. A social assessment has been carried out and is presented in Annex 16.&#13;
3.29     The community development activities of the Water Supply and Sanitation Services&#13;
component will promote the role of women in five key areas. Women will be guaranteed&#13;
representation in Water User Committees, which much have at least two women members; their&#13;
selection by women's groups will be promoted. Hygiene and sanitation and non-formal education&#13;
activities will focus on women. Women will be encouraged to take advantage of the women's&#13;
technical support services (WTSS) program, which would provide specific skill and management&#13;
training to increase the scope of income generating activities, and would help women gain access&#13;
to formal credit systems. Women will be encouraged to form female tapstand groups to collect&#13;
monthly operation and maintenance fees and to maintain tapstands. The selection of female&#13;
scheme maintenance workers will be encouraged. Women will be trained in operation and&#13;
maintenance, including collection of user fees, monitoring and reporting.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.30     All procurement of services, goods, and civil works would be carried out in&#13;
accordance with World Bank procurement guidelines. Project cost breakdown by procurement&#13;
method is presented in Table 3.1 below.&#13;

3.31      Selection &amp;  construction of water supply and sanitation schemes.  The total&#13;
estimated cost of water supply and sanitation schemes for the project would be about US$15.23&#13;
million, inclusive of contingencies, taxes, and duties. About 1,035 communities (assuming a 13%&#13;
dropout rate between the development and implementation phases) would be contracted for&#13;
development phase, resulting in 207 development phase contracts (for an average value of about&#13;
US$16,600 per contract and assuming that each support organization, on average, will&#13;
simultaneously work with five communities). About 900 implementation phase contracts - one&#13;
contract per community with an average value of US$13,000, of which about US$2,000 is for&#13;
community development activities and US$1 1,000 is for scheme construction - would be&#13;
required. Each development phase contract would be primarily for community development&#13;
activities, while each implementation phase contract would include non-local materials (small&#13;
diameter pipes, fittings, taps, handpumps, cement, etc.), community mobilization and&#13;
participation, labor, portage, and locally available materials. These numerous small contracts&#13;
would be scattered over a large number of small communities, and spread over the five years'&#13;
implementation period. Because beneficiary communities will contribute cash, all unskilled labor,&#13;
portage, and locally available materials, competitive procurement procedures may be impractical.&#13;
Support organizations would be recruited as service providers under competitive bidding&#13;
whenever possible, and otherwise as sole providers. The Board would ensure efficiency and&#13;
&#13;

equipment to be procured for the Board would be about US$0.34 million, inclusive of&#13;
contingencies, duties, and taxes. The only goods and equipment to be procured for the Board are&#13;
vehicles, computers, office furniture, and miscellaneous equipment. These cannot be grouped into&#13;
packages of more than US$50,000; they can only be grouped into several homogenous contracts,&#13;
to be procured under a separate time schedule, each estimated to cost less than the equivalent of&#13;
US$50,000. For this reason it is proposed that goods and equipment be procured by the Board&#13;
on the basis of prudent shopping.&#13;
3.33     Technical assistance, training, studies, audits, monitoring, publicity, and water&#13;
quality testing. The total estimated cost of these items for the project would be about US$4. 18&#13;
million, inclusive of contingencies and duties. Consultants paid by the Bank would be selected&#13;
following Bank guidelines.&#13;
3.34     Contract review. All individual contracts for goods and equipment for the Board and&#13;
water supply and sanitation schemes estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or more&#13;
would be subject to the Bank's prior review and approval. In addition, the Bank will review all&#13;
first batch contracts for water supply and sanitation schemes. Contracts for consulting firms in&#13;
excess of US$100,000 equivalent (for individual consultants, in excess of US$50,000 equivalent)&#13;
would be subject to the Bank's prior review and approval. Agreement to the above was obtained&#13;
during credit negotiations. This will allow prior review of contracts representing at least 10% of&#13;
the procurement under the project.&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
3.35     On the basis of the proposed implementation schedule (Annex 7), disbursements&#13;
would continue for five and a half years, less than the nine years' standard disbursement profile&#13;
for Nepal. This shorter disbursement profile is suitable for a program of investments, each of&#13;
which has a maximum duration of 36 months. It was also adopted to take into account the pilot&#13;
project's identification of a pipeline of schemes for Board financing. Disbursement is therefore&#13;
expected to be faster than normal for the first year of project implementation. The proceeds of&#13;
the Credit would be disbursed, net of taxes and duties, as outlined in Table 3.2 below.&#13;

3.36      Water supply and sanitation schemes include two contracts, one for the development&#13;
phase and the other for the implementation phase. The development phase contract provides&#13;
funding for support organizations, including the cost of employing a team leader, a community&#13;
development specialist, a community health worker, an overseer, and a community technician, and&#13;
pre-development phase costs, and overheads, as well as funding for household latrine construction&#13;
under the Sanitation Fund. The implementation phase contract specifies the total amount, how&#13;
much will be contributed by the community and how much will be contributed by the Board. The&#13;
Board's contribution at the implementation phase includes funding for support organization staff&#13;
and overheads as above, institutional latrine construction, non-local materials and equipment, and&#13;
women's technical support services.   Non-statutory audits will be internal audits and&#13;
scheme/support organization technical audits will be carried out by a private audit firm recruited&#13;
by the Board. Statements of expenditure would be used for disbursements against expenditures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
on contracts of US$50,000 or less for: i) goods, works and services for the schemes; ii)&#13;
equipment and materials for the Board; iii) Board operating costs; and iv) individual consultants&#13;
for services and training and monitoring and audits (other than statutory audits) and publicity and&#13;
water quality testing. Statements of expenditure would also be used for disbursements against&#13;
expenditures on contracts for consulting firms of US$100,000 or less.  The corresponding&#13;
documentation would not be submitted to the Bank but would be retained by the Board and made&#13;
available for inspection by auditors and during the course of Bank project supervision missions.&#13;
For all other expenditures, disbursements would be fully documented.  During negotiations&#13;
agreement was obtained that Board adoption of an implementation manual and rules satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank would be a condition for disbursement for schemes. The credit closing date is March&#13;
31, 2002. A schedule of disbursements is shown in Annex 8.&#13;
3.37     Project Preparation Advance and Special account. A Project Preparation Advance&#13;
of US$528,000 has been approved in June 1996 to complete project preparation. To facilitate&#13;
and expedite disbursements, a special account with an authorized allocation of US$0.8 million&#13;
(representing about four months of Bank-financed expenditures) would be established by the&#13;
Board on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. In particular, the Borrower would&#13;
designate the Board's Executive Director as its representative to operate the special account.&#13;
Agreement to this effect was obtained during credit negotiations. The special account would be&#13;
used to finance all eligible expenditures, and would be replenished from time to time upon receipt&#13;
and approval of withdrawal applications supported by the required documentation.&#13;
Accounts. Audit, and Reportin2&#13;
3.38     Accounts. A project accounting and record keeping system for the Board has been&#13;
developed by the pilot project. This system meets the accounting and reporting requirements of&#13;
the government as well as the Board's accounting requirements. The project accounting system&#13;
records:&#13;
.  Expenditures for establishment and operation of the Rural Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation Fund Development Board;&#13;
.  Expenditures for selection and construction of rural water supply and sanitation&#13;
schemes, with a breakdown on a scheme basis between development phase and&#13;
implementation phase costs;&#13;
*  Expenditures for institutional development and studies.&#13;
3.39     A scheme accounting manual has also been developed for support organizations&#13;
(SOs). Each SO would be required in its contract to maintain separate scheme accounts and&#13;
records to support the Board scheme accounting system. The SO would have to provide a&#13;
detailed breakdown of expenditures on a scheme basis for each main item, categorized into&#13;
community contribution (labor, portage, and locally available materials), other itemized&#13;
construction costs, and itemized community development costs. Assurances were obtained,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
during credit negotiations, that the Board would require SOs to keep separate accounts for each&#13;
scheme and to adopt and follow the above accounting system. Each SO would be required to&#13;
regularly provide the Board with updated actual scheme accounts on expenditures. Receipt of&#13;
such information by the Board would be a condition of further Board disbursements to an SO.&#13;
Assurances to this effect were obtained during credit negotiations. In particular, signing of the&#13;
implementation phase contract will be conditional upon receipt of a satisfactory audit report,&#13;
prepared by an independent commercial auditor recruited by the Board, of the expenditures&#13;
undertaken until the second payment under the development phase contract. Assurances to this&#13;
effect were obtained during credit negotiations.&#13;
3.40     Audit. The Board would maintain records and accounts in accordance with sound&#13;
accounting practices to reflect the operations, resources, and all expenditures in respect of the&#13;
project. Such records and accounts of the Board (including statements of expenditure and the&#13;
special account) would be audited annually (statutory audit) by the Kingdom of Nepal's Auditor&#13;
General's office in accordance with appropriate auditing principles, consistently applied. The&#13;
Board would be required to send the Bank, no later than three months after the close of its fiscal&#13;
year, a copy of its unaudited financial statements and, no later than nine months after the close of&#13;
its fiscal year, a copy of its audited financial statements and audit reports. Any such other&#13;
information concerning the said records, accounts, and the audit, as may be reasonably requested&#13;
by the Bank, would be furnished by the Board. In addition to the foregoing, the Board would, in&#13;
respect of withdrawals made on the basis of statements of expenditure, retain all records&#13;
evidencing such expenditures for at least one year after the Bank receives the audit report for the&#13;
fiscal year in which the last withdrawal is made. Such records would be made available to the&#13;
Bank's representatives on request and would be included in the annual audit reports. The audit&#13;
report would contain an opinion by the auditors as to whether the statements of expenditure&#13;
submitted, and the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, could be relied&#13;
upon to support the related withdrawals. Agreement was obtained, to this effect during credit&#13;
negotiations. In addition, scheme accounts kept by support organizations would be subject to&#13;
audits carried out by independent auditors to be recruited by the Board in consultation with the&#13;
Bank. Such audits would take place after the second payment of the development phase contract&#13;
and after completion of the implementation phase contract. The terms of reference of the&#13;
commercial auditors would include a requirement that they carry out a separate audit of the&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of the Board's procurement function. Agreement was obtained, to&#13;
this effect, during credit negotiations.&#13;
3.41     Flow of funds. The Board Secretariat would prepare annual budgets for Board&#13;
approval. Once approved, the annual budgets would be forwarded to the Ministry of Housing&#13;
and Physical Planning for transmission to the National Planning Commission (NPC) and the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. It was agreed during project preparation and appraisal that upon final&#13;
approval by parliament, the Ministry of Finance would make available on a grant basis such&#13;
amounts as shall be required by the Board for its operations. This agreement was confirmed&#13;
during credit negotiations. The  Board would release funding to support organizations and&#13;
communities in accordance with the payment terms of the development phase and implementation&#13;
phase contractual agreements (paras 3.17 - 3.19 and 3.21).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Monitorine. Evaluation and SuRervision&#13;
3.42     Monitoring and evaluation play a critical role in ensuring both that the overall profile&#13;
of Board performance is in line with the aims and objectives, and that the implementation of&#13;
specific projects facilitated by the Board incorporate the required level of technical quality and&#13;
effective beneficiary participation to make them sustainable. Because the Board is set up as a&#13;
facilitating instrument rather than as a delivery system with its own line of execution, the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation also has to ensure that adequate information is provided to all the&#13;
relevant stakeholders and managers - the community, the Water User Committee, support&#13;
organizations, the Board, and the Bank- to enable each to exercise their respective management&#13;
and supervisory functions.&#13;
3.43     The Board will activate and rely on a network of independent support organizations&#13;
to provide technical and financial support to isolated and weakly organized communities wanting&#13;
to improve and manage their own water supply and sanitation facilities.  The operational&#13;
procedures need to allow for a judicious balance between flexibility and prescription. Monitoring&#13;
and evaluation must therefore enable the Board to strike the right balance between the necessary&#13;
risks inherent in this approach on one hand, and the need for enforcing compliance with standards&#13;
and rules on the other.&#13;
3.44     Monitoring and evaluation will differ between the Board (or program) level and the&#13;
scheme level. Because the Board is a facilitating agency, its has to monitor the overall progress&#13;
and impact of the investments made, and the quality and performance of the contracted delivery&#13;
system.  With respect to the specific schemes the primary managers are the Water User&#13;
Committees and the support organizations. Monitoring and evaluation must consequently address&#13;
their responsibilities and interests in terms of field implementation and quality control.&#13;
Contractual compliance will be the Board's concern.&#13;
3.45     A comprehensive Monitoring and evaluation system is laid down for the Board with&#13;
five distinct points:&#13;
*  Compliance. Contracts between the Board, support organizations, and Water User&#13;
Committees will be the main point of reference. Checking compliance involves routine&#13;
and standardized follow-up (including audits) of financial management, agreed&#13;
activities, and quality of outputs. Its purpose is to trigger corrective actions or&#13;
sanctions to ensure compliance with core operational requirements.&#13;
*  Process/development. This will focus on how the quality and thrust of the services&#13;
provided change over time, and will involve a continuous assessment of how roles and&#13;
responsibilities are played out over the scheme cycle as well as over batches. Its&#13;
purpose is to enable revisions of the Board's procedural frameworks and instruments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Community. This_will focus on users' capacity to manage the assets and awareness&#13;
generated by participation in the Board program. Support organizations will facilitate&#13;
community assessments of the need for and quality of services and facilities provided.&#13;
The purpose is to provide an informed basis for active community management and&#13;
involvement.&#13;
* Impact. Changes generated by the activities, inputs, and services will be assessed in&#13;
terms of the long-term objectives of the Board. Post-implementation community&#13;
management of assets and the benefits (health, time savings, etc.) likely to accrue on a&#13;
sustained basis will be assessed. The purpose is to provide the Board, and the overall&#13;
sector policy-makers, with a continuous assessment of the economic, financial, and&#13;
social justification for the program of investment.&#13;
*  Strategy.   This is geared to documenting, disseminating, and learning from&#13;
experience. The Board's adaptive and programmatic approach requires feedback on&#13;
which approaches are working well and which are not.  This feedback can be&#13;
incorporated into the project in a cyclic or programmatic way.&#13;
3.46      The above issues would be monitored through: regular visits by Board and service&#13;
agency staff; scheme completion reports prepared by support organizations and service agencies&#13;
or the Board; audits by independent auditors; scheme Completion Reports to be written by the&#13;
Board after one season of operation for a sample of schemes; Knowledge, Attitudes, and&#13;
Practices studies before and after schemes for a selected number of communities each year; and&#13;
reviews of a small sample of schemes four years after completion to assess impact and&#13;
sustainability issues in particular.&#13;
3.47      The Board's monitoring and evaluation indicators focus both on scheme-specific&#13;
issues over the scheme cycle, and program -level issues. Scheme-specific issues include the rate&#13;
and quality of implementation, the performance and capacity of support organizations and Water&#13;
user Committees, the extent to which assumed benefits are being realized, cost-efficiency, and the&#13;
degree of active management by the community.  The program-level issues include cost-&#13;
effectiveness of service delivery through the private sector, suitability of Board policies and&#13;
procedures (including support organization and scheme selection criteria), impact of water and&#13;
sanitation interventions under varying socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and relative&#13;
efficiency of different technology options and design criteria. Monitoring indicators developed for&#13;
the Board are shown in Annex 9.&#13;
3.48      The Secretariat of the Board will have a limited in-house capacity to pursue the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation undertaken (para. 3.05). The Operations/Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Unit head would coordinate overall monitoring and evaluation. In addition, the Board will&#13;
contract service agencies, institutionally or individually, to carry  out the necessary field&#13;
investigations and analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
3.49      The National Planning Commission and the Ministry of Housing and physical Planning&#13;
will be provided with technical assistance to enable them to monitor and evaluate the overall&#13;
sector performance, and compare different delivery systems, from the public and private sectors.&#13;
Experts on short-term contracts would do this work by studying a sample of projects in different&#13;
parts of the country and under different programs. With reliable and systematic information being&#13;
made available to the planning authorities independently of the delivery system, policy-makers&#13;
could make better decisions about project and inter-agency resource allocations.&#13;
3.50      The Board shall prepare yearly work programs as well as quarterly and annual&#13;
progress reports. The reports shall cover the progress of the Board operations, including physical&#13;
progress, costs, disbursements, technical assistance, training, and other pertinent information,&#13;
together with results of monitoring and evaluation of processes, impacts, and lessons learnt. A&#13;
copy of the draft annual work program shall be submitted to the Bank for its review and&#13;
comments two months before the beginning of the fiscal year. Copies of the quarterly and annual&#13;
progress reports shall be submitted to the Bank within one month of the end of each quarter and&#13;
within two months of the end of each fiscal year, respectively.  The reports shall highlight&#13;
constraints as well as proposed remedies, based on the results of the monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
Assurances to this effect were obtained during credit negotiations.&#13;
3.51      The project is expected to require about 22 staff weeks of implementation supervision&#13;
for its first year, 1 7 for its second year, about 21 staff weeks for its third year (mid-term review)&#13;
and 14 staff weeks thereafter, in total, about 88 staff weeks over the five-year implementation&#13;
period. This estimate is based on the fact that this is the first Bank-financed project in Rural&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation in Nepal. In addition, the project's finance of dispersed investments&#13;
will face logistical challenges, and some support organizations will be dealing with a new&#13;
approach to community participation in decision making. The supervision plan is presented in&#13;
Annex 10.&#13;
3.52      A mid-term project evaluation will be carried out no later than June 30, 1999 (at the&#13;
end of the third year). The Kingdom of Nepal and the Board would review progress and decide&#13;
whether components, implementation arrangements, policy reforms, and Board operating&#13;
procedures need adjusting, as defined in the Board implementation manual. This mid-term review&#13;
will provide a forum between the Kingdom of Nepal, the Board and the Bank to discuss issues&#13;
identified and agree on remedial measures and will be followed by the remedial actions agreed&#13;
upon. Assurances to this effect were obtained during credit negotiations.&#13;
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Willingness to Pay. Affordability, and Poverty Alleviation&#13;
4.01      Households under this project would be expected to make a substantial initial&#13;
contribution to capital cost, and then to mobilize funds for all subsequent operations and&#13;
maintenance expenditures. The initial contribution to capital cost would comprise, for all water&#13;
schemes, the unskilled labor, locally available materials, and portage. In addition, communities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
would contribute a proportion of the cash costs; 2.5% of the cost of gravity schemes in the hills,&#13;
and 20% of the cost of various well schemes in the Terai. The total cash and non-cash capital&#13;
contributions would be about 40% of the cost of most schemes. Communities would also make&#13;
an initial cash deposit equal to the average estimated annual operations and maintenance&#13;
expenditure (3% of scheme construction cost in the hills, 4% in the Terai) which would be&#13;
managed by the Water User Committee.&#13;
4.02      The initial cash contributions to capital and the operations and maintenance fund&#13;
would come to NRs 273 for shallow tubewells and NRs 830 for deep tubewells per household.&#13;
Total contributions would range from NRs 503 for shallow tubewells to NRs 2,924 for gravity&#13;
schemes per household. Only in some cases would the required contribution be more than two&#13;
months' income for a household in the lowest decile; schemes would thus be affordable (Table&#13;
4.1). This was also true of the pilot project. Under the first pilot batch of schemes, communities&#13;
contributed NRs 379 per capita (38% of scheme costs) and in the second pilot batch, they&#13;
contributed NRs 440 per capita (40% of scheme costs) for gravity schemes. These figures are&#13;
equivalent to NRs 2,31 1 and NRs 2,684 per household for gravity schemes. The contributions&#13;
proposed for the project are comparable.&#13;

4.03      The percentage cash contribution to capital cost was initially proposed to induce&#13;
communities to seek low-cost designs. Limited experiments in the Terai indicate that substantial&#13;
economies may be achieved if communities are supported on a matching grant basis and fully&#13;
understand the technology choices.&#13;
4.04      If a community is willing to pay, the question arises as to whether full cost-recovery&#13;
should be attempted. The payment per household to recover all capital and operations and&#13;
maintenance costs (assuming a discount rate of 10% in real terms) would be between NRs 34 per&#13;
month for shallow tubewells and NRs 111 per month for gravity schemes. This represents&#13;
between 3% and 10% of monthly household cash income, and 1% to 4% of total income&#13;
respectively (compare Annex I 1, Tables I and 9) Such amounts are affordable in principle; the&#13;
problem would be securing repayments from communities once systems were installed, given their&#13;
geographical location and the seasonal irregularity of rural incomes. Past failures in Nepal's urban&#13;
areas to recover even partial costs at negative real interest rates suggest the unfeasibility of cost&#13;
recovery efforts, as contrasted with the proposed up-front capital contributions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
4.05     Mobilizing all the community resources required to support operations and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) on a continuous basis is not as well documented as raising initial&#13;
contributions. The continued operation of NGO-sponsored schemes after many years indicates&#13;
that community O&amp;M is feasible, however. Several communities surveyed have said they are&#13;
willing to pay NRs 13 - 30 per household per month (1993 prices) for water supplies. These&#13;
figures are comparable to estimated O&amp;M costs of the most expensive schemes. The initial O&amp;M&#13;
costs for gravity schemes would come to about NRs 19 per household per month, and about NRs&#13;
26 for deep tubewell (see Annex 11, Tables 3 to 6 for details).&#13;
4.06     Poverty Alleviation. Although cost estimates, income statistics, and survey results all&#13;
imply that schemes were affordable, some poor households could probably not contribute equally&#13;
to costs. Even if this were the case, a condition for scheme support would be that all households&#13;
would have access to the facilities (see the Board Rules, Annex 6). The pilot project showed that&#13;
communities will care for their weaker members, while bringing sanctions to bear on households&#13;
which are able to pay but hope to benefit as freeloaders.&#13;
4.07     We do not plan to target poor communities explicitly in the hills. Many NGOs seek&#13;
out less favored communities for assistance, implying that some automatic antipoverty targeting is&#13;
built into the demand-led Board procedures. Richer communities have often already benefited&#13;
from public or private schemes. Many poor families are members of larger communities, rather&#13;
than being geographically isolated in communities of their own. Since complete coverage within&#13;
communities is an eligibility criterion, poor people should benefit at least in proportion to their&#13;
share of the total population.  Taking these factors together, the proportion of  project&#13;
beneficiaries who are poor will probably be more than 40 - 60% (the proportion of all rural&#13;
households which are poor, depending on the definition of poverty). In the Terai, on the other&#13;
hand, private and public programs have resulted in widespread coverage, but may have missed&#13;
some groups, such as landless tenants. The pilot project could not get enough information on this&#13;
issue to recommend ways to ensure that the Board reaches the most undeserved groups in the&#13;
Terai. The project therefore includes a study on Terai strategy to be carried out in the first&#13;
project year.&#13;
Environmental Assessment&#13;
4.08     The project is expected to have a net positive effect on the environment. Rural water&#13;
supply and sanitation schemes are expected to save women and children's time and energy&#13;
because there will be less need for them to fetch water, improving family health and giving women&#13;
opportunities to use the time saved productively. Water will be used more effectively for bathing,&#13;
washing, and cleaning. Rural women are expected to have fewer children because of reduced&#13;
death and disease rates for children and babies. Hygiene and sanitation practices, and family&#13;
health are expected to improve. The environment will be less contaminated because of controlled&#13;
disposal of human wastes, and environmental management and catchment protection are expected&#13;
to improve. Finally, communities will be more self-reliant and independent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
4.09     Rural water supply and sanitation schemes may also have potential negative&#13;
environmental impacts. Reservoirs or other components may overflow and cause erosion and&#13;
waterlogging. Increased water use without adequate wastewater disposal may cause pollution&#13;
problems. Inappropriate sanitation units (latrines) or poorly built wells may pollute groundwater.&#13;
If there is no effective treatment, bringing contaminated surface water closer to households and&#13;
using polluted sources may have adverse effects on health. Increasing domestic water use may&#13;
deny future users its agricultural and other uses. Expansion of settlement areas because of&#13;
improved water supplies may lead to congestion and environmental pollution. Finally, quarrying&#13;
and use of access roads may cause erosion where undertaken. Many of the potential adverse&#13;
impacts will be mitigated or avoided by activities planned under the project. Notwithstanding&#13;
these potentially adverse environmental problems, the net environmental impact of the project is&#13;
expected to be positive. Annex 12 describes potential environmental impacts and mitigation&#13;
measures of the project in more detail.&#13;
Promotion of the Private Sector&#13;
4.10     A major objective of this project is for the government to stop providing those services&#13;
which are more efficiently provided by the private sector, and to focus its attention on activities&#13;
which it must carry out. These activities, in the case of rural water supply and sanitation, include&#13;
subsidizing private provision where appropriate, in this case through Board grants to support&#13;
organizations and communities, monitoring the performance of different sector actors in&#13;
accomplishing sectoral objectives (which would be sought through the institutional development&#13;
and studies component); carrying out research and development on appropriate technologies; and&#13;
improving policies to facilitate efficient service delivery. The most important immediate impacts&#13;
on the private sector would arise from the funding of schemes started and carried out with the&#13;
help of NGOs and communities. Training the staff of NGOs, community-based organizations and&#13;
other private groups under the project would also enhance the capacity of the private sector to&#13;
carry out expanded future programs. The Board would not only help the government to play a&#13;
smaller role under decentralized delivery of water supply and sanitation services, but would also&#13;
provide useful precedents for other sectors.&#13;
Impacts on Women&#13;
4.11     The project would give women and children more access to improved, adequate, and&#13;
safe water and sanitation facilities, which in turn would benefit their health and productivity.&#13;
Time and energy would be saved, and improved health would increase productivity. Women&#13;
would have more privacy, brought about by improved sanitation facilities, and they would play a&#13;
bigger role in managing water supply and sanitation schemes, including water regulation,&#13;
collection of user fees, maintenance, and reporting, monitoring, and evaluation. The non-formal&#13;
education and technical support services to women would increase literacy.&#13;
4.12     The project activities designed for the participation of women would instill a sense of&#13;
confidence through increased mobility and interaction around the community and increase access&#13;
to productive activities. This would result in institutional and social benefits such as Water User&#13;
Groups that function well, and enhanced status of women.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
4.13      The negative attitude towards more active participation of women in non-traditional&#13;
activities may prove more difficult to overcome and result in lower participation rates than&#13;
expected. Such negative attitudes would be addressed through specific information and education&#13;
awareness programs targeting local authorities, community leaders, and the community at large.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
4.14      Project justification. The proposed project would be justified on the basis of its&#13;
direct benefits to about 400,000 rural inhabitants initially, rising to about 550,000 as village&#13;
populations grow to design levels. As noted in para. 4.10 above, it would also generate non-&#13;
quantifiable benefits in the long term through the continued operations of the institutions&#13;
established under the project. In the longer term, many more communities would benefit from the&#13;
future operations of the Board, whose initial operations would be financed by the project.&#13;
Project-funded research and development activities would result in improved practices and&#13;
techniques for cost-effective supply of water and sanitation services. By developing institutions&#13;
and procedures for public funding of demand-led community-based development, this project&#13;
would enable wider replication of sustainable rural water and sanitation facilities than has been&#13;
possible using private - or public - funds alone.&#13;
4.15      Direct benefits. Rural populations would save time collecting water, and be healthier&#13;
because of more and cleaner water, improved health knowledge, and better hygiene practices.&#13;
The only benefits which have been quantified are the value of time saved in water collection and&#13;
the value of increased water consumed due to lower collection costs. No quantification of future&#13;
health benefits has been attempted because there is not enough information.&#13;
4.16      Time saving in the hills. Most schemes supported by the project are in the hills&#13;
(gravity schemes). The estimates of time saved and increased water use are based on three&#13;
different sources: a study for UNICEF by the All India Institute of Public Health (AIIPH; see&#13;
Annex 20, AIIPH 1992), Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) studies carried out before&#13;
and after nine schemes in the pilot project (six in the hills, three in the Terai); and baseline and&#13;
impact data collected for 35 pilot project schemes as part of normal processing. Each source&#13;
provides different information and is subject to substantial uncertainty, but together they provide a&#13;
basis for robust estimates about schemes in the hills. According to the AIIrPH study, the average&#13;
household served by a gravity system increased its water consumption (for household purposes&#13;
alone) from 19 to 32 liters per capita per day, while the time cost of collecting water decreased&#13;
from 2.68 minutes per liter to 0.92 minutes per liter. This implies that the demand for water has&#13;
an arc elasticity of -0. 5, which is within the range found in intemational studies (elasticities of -0.2&#13;
to -0.7). The average benefit from cost saving on the initial level of consumption would be 184&#13;
minutes per day per average household of 5.5 people, while the consumer' surplus on incremental&#13;
consumption would be 63 minutes.  According to the KAP studies, the water carried by&#13;
households (for human consumption and cattle) rose from 37.8 to 39.3 liters per capita per day,&#13;
while the unit time cost of water collection fell from 1. 18 minutes per liter to 0.48 minutes per&#13;
liter, implying a rather low arc elasticity of -0.05. The average benefit from cost saving on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
initial level of consumption would be 158 minutes per day per household of 6 people, and the&#13;
benefit from increased water carried would be 3.1 minutes. The data from the 35 completed pilot&#13;
schemes showed that the average water collection trip was 38.8 minutes long before the scheme&#13;
and 7.4 minutes long after the scheme. The time saved per trip was 31.4 minutes, which, for an&#13;
average of 10.5 water collection trips per day, implied savings on the initial level of water&#13;
consumption of 337 minutes. Estimates of initial trip times may be high side because of a&#13;
tendency to exaggerate potential time savings and secure a scheme, but the number of trips may&#13;
be underestimated. Data on water collection for cattle were excluded in many communities, while&#13;
the KAP studies found that collecting water for cattle sometimes took as many trips as water for&#13;
household consumption. For purposes of the base economic rate of return, the time saved in the&#13;
hills is estimated to be 170 minutes per household per day, and the value of increased&#13;
consumption at 20% of this, or 34 minutes per day.&#13;
4.17      Time saving in the Terai. Evidence on time saving in the Terai is less reliable and&#13;
complete than for the hills. Household surveys for the Ministry of Health suggest that improved&#13;
shallow tubewells save 4 minutes per round trip for each 12-liter container, and increase&#13;
consumption about as much as schemes in the hills. An average household of 6 people would&#13;
save about 35 minutes per day, and the value of incremental consumption would be about 9&#13;
minutes. On the other hand, the KAP studies for three pilot project schemes showed a reduction&#13;
of only 0.03 minutes per liter, and a reduction in the amount of water carried and consumed per&#13;
capita and per household, even taking account of cattle consumption.'° For purposes of the base&#13;
economic rate of return, the time saved by shallow tubewells are estimated to be 30 minutes per&#13;
household per day, and induced consumption at 6 minutes per day. These do not yield the&#13;
threshold benefit/cost ratio of 1.5 (see para. 4.26) but some schemes will probably be required to&#13;
replace heavily polluted sources. Deep tubewells and dugwells are appropriate in areas with&#13;
lower groundwater tables where shallow tube wells are not feasible, and the time spent fetching&#13;
water in such areas is more typical of the hills than the Terai. On the assumption that the Board&#13;
applies selection criteria rigorously, but allowing for some schemes on the grounds of shortage of&#13;
water or the need to replace heavily polluted sources, it is estimated that these deep tubewells and&#13;
dugwells would save 60 minutes per household per day and give 12 minutes' worth of additional&#13;
water.&#13;
4.18      Value of time saved. The valuation of time saved is based on the use of time saved&#13;
found by the AIIPH study. That study found that 30% of time saved was devoted to economic&#13;
activities, 16% to household activities (child-rearing, housekeeping, etc.), and the remainder to&#13;
socializing, sleeping, etc. The value of these activities has been estimated at 100% of the average&#13;
rural wage for economic activities, 50% for household activities, and 25% for other activities.&#13;
This is consistent with practice in other demand studies and in transport studies. The average&#13;
rural wage is estimated at NRs 40 per day. The value of time saved in gravity schemes would&#13;
thus come to NRs 2,660 per household per year, and the value of increased water consumed to&#13;
NRs 530 per capita per year (Table 3 of Annex 11). Together, these benefits would amount to&#13;
10.   The statistical uncertainties of these data are underlined by the fact that the estimate of persons per household went&#13;
from 6.31 to 5.14 between the before and after surveys in the same communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
about NRs 3,196, or more than the median monthly income in the hills." The benefits for the&#13;
other types of households would be lower, due to lower time savings.&#13;
4.19       Costs. The cost estimates are based on the pilot project. Community development&#13;
costs for each type of scheme include the development costs of the 13% of communities which&#13;
drop out between development and implementation phases. The estimates are summarized in&#13;
Annex 1 1.&#13;
4.20       Benefit/cost analysis and economic rates of return. Benefits and costs have been&#13;
forecast over a 24-year horizon from the first year of the project in 1996 border prices. Border&#13;
prices have been estimated by applying the standard conversion factor of 0.9 to all domestic&#13;
expenditures and benefits. Switching values have been calculated using the 10% opportunity cost&#13;
of capital for Nepal. Economic rates of return (ERRs) and switching values have been calculated&#13;
for each type of scheme, first including all community development as well as construction&#13;
expenses, and then including only construction costs. The first estimate understates ERRs, since&#13;
there is no quantification of health benefits.  The second overstates ERRs, since costs of&#13;
community mobilization and education are excluded. Economic rates of return are then calculated&#13;
for all schemes together according to the assumed mix of scheme types (Annex 11, Tables 2 and&#13;
3). Finally, a total project ERR is estimated by adding to the scheme costs all other project costs&#13;
(such as Board operating costs, institutional development, and studies).  Since there is no&#13;
allowance for benefits of these non-scheme expenditures, and no accounting for scheme health&#13;
benefits, the estimated project ERR of 15% is conservative. The ERR for schemes alone comes&#13;
to 22% and, for construction alone, to about 31%. The total project would result in a net present&#13;
value of NRs 218.0 million, the net present value for schemes alone would be NRs 396.0 million&#13;
and the net present value for construction alone would be NRs 511.0 million. A summary of&#13;
results is in Table 4.2 and details are provided in Annex 11. Table 4.3 sets out implications for&#13;
scheme and project ERRs on different risk scenarios described below.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
4.21      Perhaps the major economic risk in this project is that some schemes would provide no&#13;
benefits following completion of all investments. The consequences of 20% of schemes failing&#13;
outright would be approximated by the "benefits - 20%" scenario. The switching values for total&#13;
project benefits indicate that fully 25% of schemes would have to fail from the start to reduce the&#13;
project ERR to 10%. More than 25% are unlikely to fail, given the analysis provided in para.&#13;
4.22. Assuming that all schemes failed after ten years, the ERR on schemes would fall to 17%&#13;
and project ERR would fall to 8%. The very large benefits from well-selected gravity schemes&#13;
should exceed the relatively conservative base line assumptions, however.&#13;

Risks&#13;
4.22      The two principal risks of the project would be that more time and effort than now&#13;
foreseen might be required to build capacity in NGOs, communities, and the Board itself, implying&#13;
a shortfall in implementation from the current forecasts, and that outside pressures might prevent&#13;
the Board from allocating resources in a transparent fashion according to the objective criteria&#13;
agreed with the Bank. The adverse consequences of the first possibility would be minimized by&#13;
several elements of project design. First, the extensive pilot project has developed workable&#13;
procedures for rigorously applying the eligibility criteria, capacity building for support&#13;
organizations and communities, and monitoring scheme implementation.  Second, advisory&#13;
services during the initial years would help to overcome institutional teething problems and&#13;
provide on-the-job training to Board staff. Third, the number of schemes will grow gradually,&#13;
partly because the relationship between seasons and project cycles means that no hills schemes are&#13;
scheduled for implementation in the second year. This allows for delays and for learning from the&#13;
first batch of schemes without major consequences for the overall schedule. Fourth, since the&#13;
project would finance a program of schemes which met agreed eligibility criteria, disbursements&#13;
would be accelerated, slowed, or discontinued depending on performance of support&#13;
organizations and communities. The rate of implementation would be self-regulating. Fifth,&#13;
basing time saving criteria upon a benefit/cost ratio of 1.5, rather than 1.0, allows for risk and also&#13;
ensures that the project generates returns to cover Board overheads. Sixth, competence and&#13;
motivation of Board staff would be maximized by engaging them through open competition on&#13;
contract terms, with remuneration levels competitive with the private sector, and making their&#13;
tenure dependent upon performance. The pilot project has shown that such procedures work in&#13;
Nepal. The other risk, of outside political pressure, is more problematic. As noted above,&#13;
inadequate autonomy in public bodies is a major source of poor performance. Measures to&#13;
address this could obviously not be tested under the pilot project. The Board Formation Order&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
provides for the minimum degree of autonomy required for the Board to control the rules which&#13;
determine eligibility criteria and terms for staff engagement. The principal way to mitigate this&#13;
risk is to allocate substantial resources to monitoring and evaluation and to Bank supervision.&#13;
Finally, the Kingdom of Nepal has agreed to a mid-term review (para. 3.52), at which time the&#13;
project could be restructured, discontinued, or accelerated as necessary in the light of experience.&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
5.01     At negotiations, the following assurances were obtained:&#13;
a) The DWSS's service delivery responsibilities would be phased out no later than July&#13;
16, 1997 for the Central and Western Development Regions of Nepal, no later than&#13;
July 16, 1998 for the Eastern Development Region of Nepal and no later than July 16,&#13;
1999 for the Mid-Western and Far Western Development Regions of Nepal for&#13;
communities with a population of less than 500 that are funded by the Kingdom of&#13;
Nepal's own resources (para. 2.05);&#13;
b) The detailed demand study and the study for the identification of criteria for selection&#13;
of schemes in the Terai would be carried out in accordance with terms of reference&#13;
agreed with the Bank. These two studies would be completed by March 31, 1999 and&#13;
June 30, 1998 respectively and study findings would be discussed with the Bank&#13;
within 6 months thereafter and an action plan prepared and implemented (para 2.06);&#13;
c) The Kingdom of Nepal shall take all action necessary on its part to enable the Board&#13;
to formulate and implement principles and procedures for the recruitment, employment&#13;
and compensation of its staff (para 3 .03);&#13;
d) A qualified technical advisor would be recruited by the Board before January 1, 1997&#13;
(para 3.08);&#13;
e) The Kingdom of Nepal will make the proceeds of the Credit available to the Board,&#13;
under a grant agreement to be entered into between the Kingdom of Nepal and the&#13;
Board, under terms and conditions which shall be satisfactory to the Bank, including&#13;
programs requesting the Board to utilize the proceeds of the Credit to provide grants&#13;
to develop and implement rural water supply and sanitation schemes in accordance&#13;
with the provisions of the Formation Order, the rules and the implementation manual&#13;
(para 3. 10);&#13;
f) The Board will enter into arrangements with each SO and communities under such&#13;
terms and conditions as shall be acceptable to the Bank (para 3.23). The Board would&#13;
require SOs to keep separate accounts for each scheme and to adopt and follow the&#13;
accounting system prepared by the Board. Payment to an SO would be conditional&#13;
upon receipt of satisfactory updated scheme accounts on expenditures (para 3.39);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
g) Support Organization selection would be carried out in accordance with eligibility&#13;
criteria agreed with the Bank. The Board would review the adequacy of the Support&#13;
Organization eligibility criteria at the end of the implementation phase of each batch of&#13;
schemes. Changes introduced would need to be acceptable to the Bank (para 3.25);&#13;
h) Scheme selection would be carried out in accordance with eligibility criteria agreed&#13;
with the Bank. The Board would review the adequacy of the Scheme eligibility&#13;
criteria at the end of the implementation phase of each batch of schemes. Changes&#13;
introduced would need to be acceptable to the Bank (para 3.27);&#13;
i) All individual contracts for goods and equipment for the Board and water supply and&#13;
sanitation schemes in excess of US$50,000 would be subject to Bank review and prior&#13;
approval. Contracts for consulting firms in excess of US$100,000 equivalent and&#13;
contracts for individual consultants in excess of US$50,000 equivalent would be&#13;
subject to the Bank's prior review and approval. All contracts in the first batch would&#13;
be reviewed by the Bank (para. 3.34),&#13;
j) The Borrower would open a special account. The Borrower would designate the&#13;
Board's Executive Director as its representative to operate the special account (para.&#13;
3 37),&#13;
k) Scheme accounts would be audited by an independent auditor recruited by the Board&#13;
after the second payment of the development phase and after completion of the&#13;
implementation phase. Signing of the implementation phase would be conditional&#13;
upon receipt of a satisfactory audit report, of the expenditures undertaken up to the&#13;
second payment under the development phase contract (para 3.39 and 3.40);&#13;
I) The Board would maintain records and accounts in accordance with sound accounting&#13;
practices to reflect the operations, resources, and all expenditures in respect of the&#13;
project. The Board's accounts, statements of expenditures and the special account&#13;
would be audited annually by the Kingdom of Nepal's Auditor General's office. The&#13;
Board would send to the Bank, no later than nine months after the close of its fiscal&#13;
year, a copy of its audited financial statements and audit report (para. 3.40);&#13;
m) The Ministry of Finance would make available on a grant basis such amounts as shall&#13;
be required by the Board for its operations (para. 3.41);&#13;
n) The Board shall submit its annual work program to the Bank two months before the&#13;
beginning of the fiscal year, and shall submit its quarterly and annual progress reports&#13;
to the Bank one month after the end of each quarter and two months after the end of&#13;
each fiscal year, respectively (para. 3.50);&#13;
o) A mid-term review would be carried out before June 30, 1999 (para. 3.52);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
5.02      Disbursement condition:&#13;
Board adoption of an implementation manual and rules satisfactory to the Bank would&#13;
be a condition for disbursement for schemes (para 3.36),&#13;
5.03      Recommendation.  With the above assurances, the proposed project would be&#13;
suitable for an IDA Credit of SDR12.8 million (US$18.28 million equivalent) on standard IDA&#13;
terms with 40 years maturity.&#13;

RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJEC'&#13;
Detailed Proiect DescinDtion&#13;
The project includes the following three components:&#13;
(a) The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board&#13;
(b) Selection and Construction of Water Supply and Sanitation Schemes&#13;
(c) Institutional Development and Studies&#13;
A. The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board (US$ 4.98 million)&#13;
2.    The Board was created, under the Development Board Act (1956), by a Formation Order&#13;
approved by a Cabinet decision dated ----------- -Following IDA review, the Board Rules were&#13;
approved by the Board on------------. The Board is an intermediary responsible to facilitate Rural&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation service delivery through the private sector and with community&#13;
participation at all stages of the decision making process. The Board has no direct service delivery&#13;
responsibilities and will sub-contract these to SOs and communities themselves. Most training, most&#13;
monitoring and all auditing will be sub-contracted to Service Agencies (SAs). However, the Board&#13;
would have overall oversight over these activities. The Board would promote its activities through&#13;
public dissemination of information. This includes brochures, radio, newspaper, print media and visits.&#13;
3.    The Board would directly carry out the following functions: i) setting up eligibility criteria for&#13;
both SOs and Schemes; ii) identification, selection and contracting of SOs and Schemes; iii) selecting&#13;
and recruiting SAs to carry out certain functions (i.e. training, monitoring, audit); iv) day to day&#13;
management and monitoring of its portfolio (including all contracting and related disbursements); v)&#13;
preparation and implementation of its annual work programs and budgets; vi) overall management of&#13;
its operations (including its personnel, long term and short term consultants); and vi) selecting&#13;
consulting firms to carry out selected studies. This component provides funding for Board office&#13;
equipment, SO, SA and community training, Board staff training, Monitoring and Pre-Development&#13;
costs and Board recurrent costs.&#13;
Board Goods &amp; Equipments (US$ 0.34 million).&#13;
4.    Board goods &amp; equipment includes the provision of three vehicles, 8 motorcycles, a network of&#13;
office computers, all office furniture and miscellaneous office equipment.&#13;
SO, SA and Community Training (US$ 0.70 million).&#13;
5.    Training for SOs includes training on pre-feasibility studies, Community Action Planning,&#13;
Development phase proposal preparation, staff screening, training for community technician (on latrine&#13;
construction, sanitation, and CAP) and community worker (on HSE and CAP), and technical training&#13;
for overseers on design estimate and supervision. Training for communities include WUC treasurer&#13;
&#13;

training, regional Board-SO-Community training, community technician training and Tripartite&#13;
implementation phase contract orientation. SA training includes Pre-feasibility site appraisal&#13;
orientation, and training on Monitoring and Evaluation.&#13;
Board Staff Training. Monitoring &amp; Pre-Development Costs (US$ 2.44 million)&#13;
6.    Activities include all Board staff training, Board Technical Assistance and audits, development&#13;
and implementation phase monitoring, pre-development site appraisals, publicity and dissemination&#13;
costs, impact evaluation, training materials adaptation &amp; Development, water quality testing, SO&#13;
selection field visits, and monitoring of WUG legal registration.&#13;
Recurrent Costs (US$ 1.50 million)&#13;
7.    Recurrent costs include all staff salaries and allowances, office operating expenses and repair&#13;
and maintenance costs.&#13;
B. Selection and Construction of Water Supply and Sanitation Schemes (US$ 15.23 million)&#13;
8.    The scheme cycle spans 36 months and includes the following phases: Pre Development (13&#13;
months), Development (10 months) and Implementation (13 months). Activities within each phase&#13;
may vary in response to the particular situation found in a given community (community capacity to&#13;
organize) and as a result the duration of each phase may vary from community to community. This&#13;
component provides funding for Community Development as well as hardware activities within each of&#13;
the three above phases.&#13;
Community Development Activities (US$ 3.88 million)&#13;
9.    The purpose of the Community Development activities is to ensure people's participation in&#13;
decision making, to increase local ownership and effective use and sustainability of schemes, and to&#13;
build capacity to engage in other community development efforts. Community Development activities&#13;
will include three main activities; (a) Capacity Building Activities; (b) Hygiene and Sanitation&#13;
Education; and (c) Technical Support Services to Women.&#13;
Capacity Building Activities (US$ 2.13 million)&#13;
10.   Lessons from previous projects and the pilot project have emphasized that it is essential to have&#13;
a well organized community that is capable of promoting and managing community inputs to water&#13;
supply and sanitation schemes. The project will support specific activities to promote active&#13;
participation of the community in all stages of the scheme cycle. Capacity building activities will&#13;
include; (a) community organization/mobilization; and (b) complementary non-formal education.&#13;
(a)    Community Organization/Mobilization (US$ 1.88 million!. This includes a series of&#13;
orientation and training activities designed to enhance community capacity such as&#13;
group formation and leadership training leading to the formation, during the&#13;
Development phase, of an effective water user group (WUG), a representative water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 10&#13;
user committee (WUC), with at least two women, and specific user groups capable of&#13;
planning, implementing, operating and managing water and sanitation schemes. The&#13;
project would support a community health worker (CHW) and a technician as basic&#13;
community level field worker supervised by a Community Development supervisor&#13;
and an overseer. Specifically, the following activities would take place in each&#13;
community:&#13;
(i)   information campaigns and getting to know the community. The CHW with&#13;
inputs from the Community Development supervisor would assess felt needs of&#13;
different groups within the community, reconcile these through continuous&#13;
dialogue with each of the groups and anticipate any conflicts that may arise.&#13;
(ii)   group formation and structuring to form a water user committee, and&#13;
orientation and training of WUC members (Treasurer training, management&#13;
training, Community Maintenance Worker training and Community Worker&#13;
training) to be able to participate actively in all stages of the scheme cycle. The&#13;
Community Health Worker (CHW) would be responsible for creating an&#13;
environment which would allow communities to engage im a process that&#13;
enables them to organize into groups and build confidence. The CHW would&#13;
assist women in their efforts to attain self reliance and would provide&#13;
orientation and training to the community health promoter and WUC members.&#13;
The technician with inputs from the overseer would assist the community&#13;
during the preparation stage to select designs, participate during construction,&#13;
and prepare the community to operate, maintain and manage the water and&#13;
sanitation systems built under the project by providing training of the&#13;
Community Maintenance Worker.&#13;
(iii)  participatory community assessment and action planning which would utilize&#13;
interactive principles, methods and techniques, and other social process&#13;
methods (e.g., Self Esteem, Associative Strength, Responsibility, Action&#13;
Planning and Resourcefulness (SARAR), Participatory Rural Appraisal&#13;
(PRA)). The project will encourage SOs to develop a set of simple&#13;
interventions on orientation, training and other means which would integrate&#13;
the organizational, health and sanitation education objectives of the project.&#13;
11.   Project support per scheme would include the salaries of a community health worker (CHW),&#13;
Community Development supervisor and material and travel costs. A total of four core orientation and&#13;
training activities would be carried out by the SOs (orientation and training on pre-feasibility studies,&#13;
WUC selection, leadership training and community action planning) and it is expected that SO input&#13;
would be highest during the development phase. Responsibility for community organization and&#13;
strengthening would be equally shared with the WUC during implementation with the SO role&#13;
expected to be phased down following construction of works as the community assumes full&#13;
responsibility for its water supply and sanitation schemes and other complementary programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(b)   Non-Formal Education (US$ 0.25 million). Experience has shown that community&#13;
education has been a useful starting point in mobilizing women in communities with no&#13;
previous experience in cooperative action and characterized as having low level of&#13;
organizational capability. Participatory non-formal education focuses on providing&#13;
women the opportunity to discuss their problems in an informal setting and increased&#13;
their problem solving capacity. It has also been found to accelerate the process of&#13;
development in communities that participated. In this case, people became more&#13;
receptive to new ideas, easier to mobilize, self confident, and are willing to take more&#13;
new responsibilities. The project would support the following activities:&#13;
(i)    The SO would assess the need for NFE during the pre-development phase.&#13;
Mass and group meetings would be carried out to discuss the need, level, and&#13;
intensity of NFE in each community. The SO will determine the number of&#13;
NFE classes and, on the basis of the level of intensity, it will identify potential&#13;
NFE supervisors and tutor/facilitators available in the community to be&#13;
included in the proposal. The proposal should show that it can access&#13;
experienced facilitator/tutor through previous experience and or available&#13;
NFE/SAs,&#13;
(ii)   SOs with no previous experience in organizing NFE classes would develop&#13;
partnership arrangements with available NFE/SAs for management support&#13;
including access to materials, supervisor and facilitator training and monitoring&#13;
visits. Payments for SA support would be included in the development phase&#13;
contract. The Board would provide a list of NFE/SAs available in the areas&#13;
with proven tract record in the field of NFE.&#13;
(iii)   Literacy materials and primers that have been developed both by the&#13;
govemment and non govemmental organizations would be used. The leaming&#13;
process would focus on courses dealing with water, hygiene, environmental&#13;
sanitation and community participation. The project would support the cost of&#13;
materials and tutor/facilitator salaries.&#13;
(iv)   NFE classes targeted especially for women would be held at the rate of one&#13;
class per 25 participants and funding support would be provided during the&#13;
development phase. It is anticipated that 50% of communities would require&#13;
NFE.&#13;
Hvgiene and Sanitation Education (HSE US$ 1.55 million)&#13;
12.   Many organizations involved in water supply and sanitation use different approaches for HSE&#13;
with varying degrees of intensity. HSE programs that use a participatory approach have been more&#13;
successful than those that rely on disseminating health messages. In addition, hygiene and sanitation&#13;
education activities that run independently of the water supply and sanitation projects are less effective&#13;
in achieving behavioral changes and improved hygiene conditions. The project would support HSE&#13;
that would be developed with the community, taking their knowledge as the starting point. Activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
would be integrated with water supply and sanitation activities from all phases of the project cycle.&#13;
Women will be the focal point of all HSE activities.&#13;
13.  The objectives of the HSE program are to: (i) inform and orient resident communities of water&#13;
and filth bome related diseases, causes, effects and prevention; (ii) implement a participatory HSE&#13;
program through trained community volunteers; (iii) orient and train SO/SA staff and govemment&#13;
health staff on participatory hygiene and sanitation education principles and methods; and (iv) build the&#13;
institutional capacity and capability of communities, SO/SAs, and local health centers as appropriate to&#13;
carry out hygiene and sanitation education activities more effectively.&#13;
14.  The HSE program would consist of: (i) promotional and media campaigns for hygiene and&#13;
sanitation related issues; (ii) orientation and training of health and volunteer workers in all&#13;
communities; (iii) equipping selected SOs with audio visual and other Community Development&#13;
matenals including specialized training to selected SO and health staff; (iv) training trainers to deliver&#13;
hygiene and sanitation messages to the communities; (v) support to hygiene and sanitation in the&#13;
schools covered by the communities involved in the project; and (vi) part-funding for latrines in project&#13;
communities through a community level sanitation lending fund..&#13;
15.  Approach and Strategy. It is expected that most if not all of the SOs would use a combination&#13;
of participatory and promotional approaches through the use of communication tools and techniques,&#13;
demonstration activities and cross visits where similar WSS schemes are being implemented. The&#13;
project would support the placement of female CHW through the SOs to bring about changes&#13;
particularly in personal and domestic hygiene. To promote the active participation of women, SO staff&#13;
would: (i) discuss with local leaders the need to involve women in water supply and sanitation services;&#13;
(ii) visit women individually particularly the poorest to solicit their participation; and (iii) organize&#13;
women into small groups to discuss issues and develop their problem solving capacity.&#13;
16.  The program would focus on improving personal, domestic, environmental sanitation and&#13;
primary health care. Emphasis would be given to bring about changes in those behavior that would&#13;
directly improve health. The baseline information on HSE will form part of the Community Action&#13;
Plan. Women would be involved in monitoring and evaluation activities by measuring changes in&#13;
hygiene practices such as water use and management, personal hygiene, domestic hygiene and&#13;
environmental sanitation. Since health improvements have been linked with other important factors&#13;
such as literacy levels and improved income, HSE activities would form linkages with non-formal&#13;
education classes, and support services to women activities.&#13;
17.   Target Groups for HSE would include leaders of different socio-economic, age, cultural,&#13;
religious and geographic categories such as community elders, traditional birth attendants (TBAs),&#13;
school age children with special emphasis to women's groups. The assumption made here is that&#13;
individual behavior depends on pressures to conform exerted by peers, and formal and informal&#13;
community leaders. Women as providers of family hygiene and sanitation play a crucial role in&#13;
affecting behavioral changes particularly their own young children. In addition, men usually control&#13;
finances and it is imperative that men also understand the factors affecting their health and that of their&#13;
families. School children, selected teachers and other government extension personnel are considered&#13;
important target groups and would be given priority.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
18.   In each community, HSE activities would center on the following HSE activities and focus&#13;
groups:(a) Mother and Child Health focusing on health, hygiene awareness targeting the individual&#13;
household and women/tapstand groups; (b) Community and environmental sanitation, using&#13;
promotional and mass communication campaigns and demonstration activities,(c) Latrine promotion&#13;
program in support of the Sanitation Fund managed by the community, and(d) School program (where&#13;
possible) covering the school children and teachers.&#13;
19.   Methods and Tools. A combination of two methods would be used: (i) interpersonal and or&#13;
face to face communication, and (ii) mass media campaigns including the use of radio, wall posters,&#13;
leaflets, and other communication materials. HSE would be conducted in informal settings and by&#13;
using life situations and experiences. Community members would practice problem solving skills&#13;
through face to face discussion with the community/hygiene facilitator. It has been shown that HSE&#13;
activities are more effective in small group discussions usually 6-12 people. Hence small group&#13;
discussions on real life situations would be opted to modify attitudes and behavior. Complementary&#13;
techniques already being used by a number of SOs, some of them developed by the pilot project,&#13;
would be encouraged such as role playing, flip charts, the use of media, radio talks, video and motion&#13;
pictures, folk media such as drama, songs and games, and other social marketing techniques specially&#13;
to promote sanitation facilities would be used to repeat and reinforce messages.&#13;
20.   HSE orientation and training for women groups would be a priority activity through&#13;
tapstand groupings. Women would be involved in monitoring and evaluation activities by measuring&#13;
changes in hygiene practices such as water use and management, tapstand hygiene, personal, domestic&#13;
and environmental sanitation. Tapstand leaders would be trained on household observation and record&#13;
keeping of user acceptance of the new facilities. In addition, primary health care training designed for&#13;
the school teachers, community leaders, traditional birth attendants, and health post staff would&#13;
incorporate learning with development activities such as improving the environment by identifying&#13;
mosquito breeding sites caused by improper drainage, use of sanitary facilities, treatment for diarrhea&#13;
and skin diseases, growth monitoring etc. The orientation and training activities for HSE would be&#13;
integrated with the implementation of the overall capacity building activities. HSE orientation and&#13;
training would begin during the development phase and peak dunng the implementation phase.&#13;
Women's Technical Support Services (WTSS) (US$ 0.20 million)&#13;
21.   It has been shown that women's involvement in planning and management of water supply&#13;
improves performance and enhances benefit. Despite reported successes, institutionalizing the&#13;
inclusion of women in project planning and implementation will not be easy. A technical support&#13;
service to women would be established to focus on five key areas including, (i) skill enhancement&#13;
training to help women develop additional skills required to realize the benefits from improved water&#13;
and sanitation services; (ii) improvement in the access of women in the formal credit systems; (iii)&#13;
promotion of women in the planning and implementation of water supply and sanitation schemes; (iv)&#13;
operation and maintenance and resource mobilization activities on water collection, collection of user&#13;
charges, monitoring and evaluation; and (v) gender training and information for SOs, SAs and&#13;
community leaders. Project support would be in the form of training, material development and&#13;
provision of materials for Community Development activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
22.  Planning for WTSS would take place during the development phase as part of the community&#13;
planning exercise. SOs would assist potential participants to define a menu of activities that could be&#13;
supported as part of the CAP. The proposal should show that women groups have been formed,&#13;
activities are clearly indicated and the proposal is prepared by the women groups themselves. It is&#13;
anticipated that priority would come from participants involved in NFE courses and tapstand members.&#13;
The number of activities would be small at the beginning to take into account the limited absorptive&#13;
capacity of the women groups as well as the SO/SA staff and the availability of other successful&#13;
programs operating in the locality. SOs would ensure that WTSS groups are well aware about the&#13;
organizations, opportunities, inputs and services available within the locality. Project support for each&#13;
community submitting an acceptable proposal would not exceed NRs 10,000 or Nrs 200 per woman&#13;
participant whichever is lower&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation Schemes (US$ 11.35 million)&#13;
23.    Activities are divided into three phases; Pre-Development phase, Development phase and&#13;
Implementation phase. The activities include prefeasibility studies, survey and design of schemes,&#13;
construction cost of water supply schemes, school/institutional and household latrines, and catchment&#13;
protection activities.&#13;
24.    Pre-Development Phase (US$ 0.11 million). This includes the cost of inputs from an engineer&#13;
and a social scientist to carry out a prefeasibility study for each scheme. As part of the Pre-&#13;
Development phase, source flow rates will be determined by the SO and confirmed by the SA The&#13;
SO cost will only be reimbursed for those schemes selected for the Development phase.&#13;
25.    Development Phase (US$ 1.30 million). This covers the cost of an overseer for survey and&#13;
design for gravity schemes in the hills and shallow tubewells, deep tubewells and dug wells in the&#13;
Terai. It also provides funding for the Sanitation revolving Fund (US$0.41 million) for household&#13;
latrines. Household latrine construction will be financed from a Sanitation revolving Fund created&#13;
during the development phase. The Water User Committee will provide loans to households. Latrine&#13;
technology will utilize the most appropriate technology for the area taking into consideration&#13;
environmental issues such as soil conditions, water table and distance to water sources. Table A 1-I&#13;

Based on experience during the pilot project, a 13% drop out rate between the development phase and&#13;
implementation phase is anticipated. Therefore, 1035 schemes serving an initial population of 453,000&#13;
persons are budgeted for development.&#13;
26.   Implementation Phase (US$ 9.94 million) The Implementation phase hardware costs includes&#13;
the construction, rehabilitation and augmentation costs for water schemes, catchment protection and&#13;
institutional latrines. A total of 900 communities have been budgeted for implementation serving a&#13;
current population of 394,050 corresponding to a design population of about 550,000. Table A1-2&#13;

Water Supply (US$ 8.98 million)&#13;
27.    All water supply scheme construction and rehabilitation activities designed in the Development&#13;
phase take place during the Implementation phase. Community members would be required to provide&#13;
all unskilled labor, portage, locally available materials and an upfront cash contribution towards the&#13;
scheme's capital cost. The breakdown of costs for each scheme is described in Table Al-3.&#13;

Catchment Protection (US$ 0.13 million)&#13;
28.   Catchment protection includes environmental impact mitigation activities consisting of&#13;
community tree planting for catchment protection in gravity schemes. Catchment protection includes&#13;
community tree plantation on about 5 ha of land upstream of the source managed by the users. The&#13;
project would support the cost of saplings.&#13;
Institutional Latrines Construction (US$ 0.83 million)&#13;
29.    The project will support the construction of two institutional latrines per scheme in either&#13;
schools or health posts.&#13;
C. Institutional Development &amp; Studies (US$ 1.04 million)&#13;
30.   There will be a need for applied research and development studies to improve information&#13;
available to policy makers in designing sector policies and to test improved methods and techniques in&#13;
Community Development as well as in construction that are cost-effective. The studies to be carried&#13;
out and which are not included in the Board's M&amp;E system are:&#13;
a)    Identification of criteria for scheme selection and corresponding scheme cycle in the&#13;
Terai (US$ 0.08 million). With a predominantly alluvial soil formation, a high static&#13;
water table, and a socio-economically stratified dense population, the Terai exhibits a&#13;
radically different challenge for the Board as compared to the hilly areas. The study&#13;
will identify and evaluate the operational feasibility of targeting Board investments on&#13;
those groups and individual households with least capacity to pay for or otherwise gain&#13;
access to RWSS facilities supplied through existing private sector provisions. Based on&#13;
its findings it will recommend a scheme cycle for Terai schemes including shallow&#13;
tubewells, dugwells, and sanitation improvement.&#13;
b)    Detailed demand studies (US$ 0.16 million). The study aims at developing reliable and&#13;
cost-effective methodologies for estimating demand for water supply and sanitation&#13;
facilities, and the valuation placed on them by rural communities, in order to improve&#13;
current parameters and assumptions used in pre-feasibility and feasibility studies as&#13;
well as in monitoring and evaluation. The study shall also assess and improve measures&#13;
of demand for different types of schemes used for calibrating design standards and&#13;
demand formation required under the present Board operations.&#13;
(c)    Preparation of follow-on project (US$ 0.24 million). This package of studies will&#13;
consolidate and incorporate lessons learnt and experiences gained from the Board&#13;
operations as well as other community based approaches in Nepal or within the region&#13;
in order to formulate a possible follow-on project.&#13;

Annex I&#13;
Page 10 of 10&#13;
d)     Special studies (US$ 0.31 million). As a result of the monitoring and evaluation as well&#13;
as recurrent supervisory visits a number of issues will emerge that require follow up&#13;
and focal in-depth studies. The JAKPAS experience suggests inter alia the following&#13;
issues: (i) identification of incentives to promote and adopt low cost technology&#13;
options; (ii) water quality control at source as well as in-home; (iii) community&#13;
perception of current eligibility, selection, and management procedures, including&#13;
choice of service levels; (iv) lack of incentives to promote cost-efficiency in the scheme&#13;
cycle; (v) health impact assessment. For each such limited focal study Terms of&#13;
Reference will be developed as required by the Board Secretariat, with the assistance&#13;
of the regional unit of the UNDP/World Bank Rural Water Supply Group providing&#13;
professional advice and assistance if needed.&#13;
(e)    National Planning Commission (NPC) and Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning&#13;
(MHPP) sector assessment and monitoring (US$ 0.25 million). This will compn'se&#13;
recurrent monitoring and assessment of different programs within the rural water&#13;
supply and sanitation sector, dissemination of experiences and lessons learnt to relevant&#13;
actors, and provide a basis for further clarification of the government policies in&#13;
support of community based water supply and sanitation. Such assessments will also&#13;
assist the NPC and MHPP in making actual program effectiveness in allocating&#13;
budgets over time.&#13;

RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR SELECTED PROJECT FINANCED STUDIES&#13;
L Identification of Poverty Focused Selection Criteria in the Terai&#13;
Justification&#13;
The Terai is the most densely populated region in Nepal, with an extreme socio-&#13;
economic stratification ranging from asse-less migrant labour to absentee landlords. From a&#13;
technical point of view the Terai is less complicated than the hilly areas, having a high static&#13;
water-table accessible through such simple technologies as dugwells and shallow tubewells for&#13;
which there is a local implementation capacity. However, past experience shows that neither&#13;
externally supported Rural Water Supply &amp; Sanitation interventions nor private sector&#13;
operations reach the weakest sections of the population that is consequently forced to rely on&#13;
the most unsanitary facilities or sources. Against this background a study is required to&#13;
provide a feasible approach to socio-economic targeting of Board investments.&#13;
Objectives: The main objectives of the study are to&#13;
(a)   identify socio-economically relevant and operationally feasible criteria for&#13;
Board investments to reach the poorest underserved population;&#13;
(b)    propose a methodology for identification, selection, and appraisal capable of&#13;
being implemented by the Board;&#13;
(c)   identify and assess appropriate local support structures for scheme&#13;
development and implementation;&#13;
(d)   finaGse a Terai-specific scheme cycle based on the above.&#13;
Methodology: The study will be carried out as a series of overlapping activities:&#13;
(a)   inventory and compilation of secondary information available regarding the&#13;
demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the Terai, including&#13;
information available with local government bodies,&#13;
(b)   compilation of the performance and experience of DWSS and NGO operations&#13;
in the Rural Water Supply &amp; Sanitation sector in the Terai;&#13;
(c)   inventory of the legal rights and entitlement issues of the squatter population&#13;
and landless labourers with respect to RWSS facilities or similar capital&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

investments made individually or collectively by them or on their behalf by&#13;
extemal agents (including government);&#13;
(d)    a limited number of community level RRA/PRA studies with poorer&#13;
households to identify strategic direct or proxy indicators of poverty/ capacity&#13;
to pay, nature and pattern of access to RWSS facilities, and forms of&#13;
collective/cooperative resource management (including existing or potential&#13;
CBO arrangements). Although limited in number, these studies must range&#13;
over different agro-ecological contexts of the Terai;&#13;
(e)    undertake a diagnostic sample survey in order to test the validity, feasibility and&#13;
range of variation of the target-group indicators suggested by the RRA/PRA&#13;
studies;&#13;
(f)    based on the above, the study shall compile a report comprising:&#13;
(i)    options of targeting Board investments, along with an assessment of&#13;
the pros and cons of each;&#13;
(ii)    a methodological guideline of scheme selection in the Terai, including&#13;
selection of support organisations, for adoption by the Board&#13;
Secretariat;&#13;
(iii)  identification of such institutional issues that require attention by the&#13;
Board in implementing the Terai component, particularly as regards&#13;
contractual issue and issues of entitlement and ownership of assets&#13;
created with Board assistance.&#13;
Staffing&#13;
The study will be recurrently guided and coordinated by an international short term&#13;
expert having considerable analytical experience of target-group and demand driven Rural&#13;
Water Supply &amp; Sanitation in South Asia. Core national expertise include a rural survey&#13;
specialist familiar with RRA/PRA techniques, a socio-economist, and a sanitation engineer.&#13;
II. Detailed Demand Studies&#13;
Justification&#13;
The Project would support the delivery of demand led, cost effective and sustainable&#13;
water supply services to rural communities. Project success would depend on effectively&#13;
responding to such demand. Essential underpinning of project justification is that there is&#13;
demand for facilities, and the value of facilities exceeds the cost. In addition, understanding&#13;
demand is essential for determining optimal design criteria (households per tapstand or per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  7-                        Annex 2&#13;

well, distance to sources, etc.) and for developing viable systems for mobilizing as many&#13;
resources as possible from beneficiaries while ensuring that they realize potential benefits of&#13;
schemes. Estimating demand is difficult to do reliably and often seems to involve high costs.&#13;
Proposals based on 156 prefeasibility studies received for thePilot Project's second tranche&#13;
indicate community willingness to contribute 1-10% of the capital cost of gravity scheme and&#13;
1-30% of capital cost of tubewell schemes in cash in addition to all local materials, porterage&#13;
and labor. These are preliminary indicators and may not reflect actual community willingness&#13;
to contribute since SO staff undertaking prefeasibility studies would not have had intensive&#13;
interaction with the community at large. Nonetheless, such stated willingness to pay would&#13;
likely be lower than true demand for the service. While it took some time for JAKPAS&#13;
conmmunities (first batch) to understand the purpose of community cash contribution towards&#13;
capital cost it successfully collected minimum 1% of capital cost in cash. The proposed study&#13;
would seek to provide elements to improve demand estimation. This study would complement&#13;
other research and development (R&amp;D) studies especially, monitoring and evaluation and the&#13;
health impact study.&#13;
Objectives: The main objectives of the study are to:&#13;
(a)    develop robust reliable and cost effective methodologies for estimating demand&#13;
for water supply and sanitation facilities, and the valuation placed on them by&#13;
rural communities, which can be used in carrying out prefeasibility, feasibility,&#13;
and monitoring and evaluation work; and&#13;
(b)   improve measures of demand for different types of schemes which can be used&#13;
to calibrate design standards and demand information required under the&#13;
present project.&#13;
Methodology: Demand for purposes of this study will cover, at a minimum, the quantities of&#13;
water consumed by households and the costs of collecting, storing and using it. The analysis&#13;
will also need to take account of:&#13;
(a)   the money valuation of water (in terms of the value of time saved from&#13;
improved water supplies, or using other methodologies); and&#13;
(b)   the possible implications of health considerations for valuation, for example,&#13;
differences in valuation when communities are aware of health benefits. These&#13;
topics are expected to be important issues in impact monitoring activities and&#13;
the health impact study. The exact definition of scope for the demand study&#13;
needs to be done in the context of these other activities. The study will&#13;
involve:&#13;
(i)    Review literature on rural water supply and sanitation demand, and the&#13;
relationship between demand and design standards. This would include&#13;
a review of World Bank reports and documents including Time for a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -                  Annex 2&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
Change, and other literature on willingness to pay together with studies&#13;
which have been carried out in Nepal (including the AIIPH 1992).&#13;
(ii)   Review reliability and cost effectiveness of procedures being followed&#13;
by JGFFT and SOS under NRWSSP on the basis of analysis of data,&#13;
interviews with staff, and limited field work.&#13;
(iii)   Based on the above information, plus additional field work as required&#13;
regarding performance of past demand assessment methods, make&#13;
recommendations on improved methodologies for Support&#13;
Organizations, Board staff, and M&amp;E activities.&#13;
(iv)   Field test the most promising methodologies. The tests should include&#13;
carrying out all relevant surveys and analyses of results. It would make&#13;
recommendations on future demand estimation for (a) Support&#13;
Organizations, and (b) M&amp;E activities. Results would also include&#13;
proposed changes in benefit measures used in applying scheme&#13;
eligibility criteria.&#13;
(v)    Carry out revised test using best methodology from earlier steps, and&#13;
define detailed recommendations including sampling size,&#13;
questionnaires, timing and frequency of surveys, and systems for data&#13;
analysis, detailed training materials for use by SOs, Board, or M&amp;E&#13;
staff for fuiture application of the methodology.&#13;
Staffing&#13;
The study would require inputs of economists and survey specialist. Additionally the&#13;
study would require short term inputs of an international economist (with substantial&#13;
experience in undertaking this type of study) since it is a relatively new area where local&#13;
experience may be shortcoming. The study would be undertaken in two phases depending on&#13;
tasks to be accomplished.&#13;
m1. NPC &amp; MHIPP Sector Monitorin2 Studies&#13;
Justification&#13;
A special provision is made for sector monitoring activities to be managed by the&#13;
National Planning Commission and the Ministry of Housing and physical Planning. Efforts&#13;
would be made to disseminate, promote and monitor criteria and procedures adopted for the&#13;
Project such that there is a clear unified policy to support the community based approach.&#13;
Policies would have provision for integration of water supply and sanitation with software&#13;
activities such as health and hygiene education, training and other complementary programs&#13;
based on community needs assessment. The study would monitor and evaluate SO&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

implementation performance and project impact. Specific studies would be carried out during&#13;
the entire Project period to generate information on successes and failures to provide&#13;
information to define future policies and investment decision.&#13;
Objectives: The main objective of the study would be to:&#13;
(a)    review and evaluate the performances of Rural Water Supply &amp; Sanitation&#13;
activities undertaken by different agencies;&#13;
(b)    formulate coherent and unified national policies for the sector based on proper&#13;
documentation and analysis of success cases;&#13;
(c)    disseminate lessons learned from the Project to other institutions in the sector,&#13;
(d)   identify ways of successfully integrating the sector with other sectors involved&#13;
in rural development; and&#13;
(e)    prepare a national level M&amp;E system for the sector.&#13;
Methodology: The study would focus on the following activities:&#13;
(a)    Review programs of different agencies involved in the sector with reference to&#13;
monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
(b)    Undertake evaluation of performance of different Rural Water Supply &amp;&#13;
Sanitation programs in light of cost effectiveness, reliability, sustainability and&#13;
replicability.&#13;
(c)    Recommend a unified policy for sector development, sector coordination and&#13;
integration with other sectors in rural development.&#13;
Staffing&#13;
Core staff required for the study include rural water supply and sanitary engineer, an&#13;
economist, a social science specialist and field survey staff. The study would be undertaken&#13;
over the Project period.&#13;
IV. Suecial Studies&#13;
Justification&#13;
As a result of the monitoring and evaluation as well as of the recurrent supervisory visits&#13;
a number of issues will emerge that require follow up and focal in-depth studies. The JAKPAS&#13;
experience suggests inter alia the following issues:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
(a)   identification of incentives to promote and adopt low cost technology options;&#13;
(b)   field studies on measures to promote water quality from source to house;&#13;
(c)   study of community perceptions of current eligibility criteria as well as selection&#13;
and management procedures, incl. choice of service levels;&#13;
(d)   identification of incentives to promote cost-efficiency in the scheme cycle;&#13;
(e)    health impact assessments.&#13;
to provide specific feedback to the relevant stakeholder of the Board operations on&#13;
core issues identified during the course of implementation;&#13;
to provide a basis for strategic learning and development, including consolidated&#13;
thematic inputs to forward programming of Board operations.&#13;
The studies will in most cases require procurement of local consultancy inputs, and in&#13;
exceptional cases also of international expertise. A total of 5 mm of international and 25 mm&#13;
of local experts, along with supporting staff has been envisaged.&#13;
V. Preparation of a FoIIow-up Proiect&#13;
Justficatio-&#13;
A preparation package to develop further follow-up programs incorporating lessons&#13;
learnt and experience gained from the present community based approach would provide&#13;
valuable policy and program level inputs for future director towards more effective delivery of&#13;
Rural Water Supply &amp; Sanitation Services. Areas of interest for follow-up programs in&#13;
community based water supply would include (but not limited to) refining and developing cost&#13;
effective training and communication packages, development of low cost appropriate&#13;
technologies, skill enhancing income generating software activities for women, development of&#13;
acdvities to integrate the sector with other sectors of rural development. The project would&#13;
define specific activities and programs as it gains experience.&#13;

RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Criteria&#13;
1.    The project will finance the construction of 900 schemes. A major point of this project is&#13;
to improve the environmental health of the community by supporting sanitation education, health&#13;
training, training on latrine construction, and technical assistance and materials to construct water&#13;
supply schemes. Environmental improvements lead to improved social and economic&#13;
improvements, especially for women and children. Some of the main environmental health&#13;
improvements include:&#13;
(a)   Time and energy savings for women and children by bringing water closer to the&#13;
home.&#13;
(b)   Increased water supply for bathing, washing and cleaning.&#13;
(c)   Improvements in hygiene and sanitation.&#13;
(d)   Reduced bacterial contamination due to controlled disposal of human waste.&#13;
2.    There are potential negative environmental impacts associated with the delivery of water&#13;
and sanitation services. Some of these impacts have already become evident in the pilot phase of&#13;
this project. The potential negative impacts include:&#13;
(a)   Contamination of the spring source during spring development and construction.&#13;
(b)   Induced erosion caused by pipe laying, general construction activities,&#13;
deforestation and improper drainage.&#13;
(c)   Improper construction of latrines leading to non-sustainable sanitation and ground&#13;
water contamination, especially in the Terai.&#13;
(d)   Improper construction of spring intake structure leading to short lived water&#13;
supply and possible destruction of the source.&#13;
(e)   Potential for cross contamination due to improperly joined pipe, broken valves or&#13;
leaky tanks.&#13;
(f)    Source tapping may deny water to previous users of the source not connected to&#13;
the scheme.&#13;
(g)   Tapping entire streams and springs cause downstream stream beds to dry up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
(h)   Construction activities may induce deforestation and encroach on undisturbed&#13;
habitats at the spring intake structure, quarry sites and pipe trenches.&#13;
3.    Though there are inherent environmental issues in any water and sanitation program, this&#13;
project aims to insure the damage is minimized through lessons learned in the pilot phase, the&#13;
overall project approach and on-going training and technical manual provisions. The pilot phase&#13;
identified the above causes of adverse environmental impacts and subsequently several mitigation&#13;
measures were applied.&#13;
4.    The overall project approach targets both community participation and improved technical&#13;
and social assistance from decentralized support organizations. The training and education&#13;
components empower the support organizations and communities to construct and maintain long&#13;
lived systems. The project includes training and technical manuals which inform the Support&#13;
Organizations and communities on how to avoid the negative environmental impacts associated&#13;
with a project of this nature. Environmental measures will be included in the Community Action&#13;
Plan prepared during project development. More detailed environmental impacts and mitigation&#13;
measures are listed in the various training and technical manuals. Subsequent training and&#13;
technical manuals will continue to improve due to the built in monitoring and evaluation&#13;
component. A summary of mitigation measures are listed below.&#13;
5.    Site Clearance and Earth Moving - Site clearance, including tree cutting, and earth&#13;
moving during site selection and construction of intake structures, reservoirs, and pipe laying can&#13;
leave the affected area prone to erosion. Steep slopes and monsoons amplify the impact.&#13;
(a)   In order to avoid the monsoon season, the project has timed construction in the&#13;
dry season.&#13;
(b)   Construction and tree cutting on steep slopes will be avoided.&#13;
(c)    Soils will be properly compacted after backfilling.&#13;
(d)   Alternative siting will be considered for system components to avoid&#13;
encroachment to wildlife and minimize deforestation.&#13;
(e)   The project already includes tree planting to protect intake structures from&#13;
pollution and erosion. This will be extended to steep slopes and other erosion&#13;
prone areas where earth moving and site clearing occurs.&#13;
(f)    Unstable slopes will be avoided for quarrying of construction materials because of&#13;
the potential for landslides and damage to vegetation along footpaths.&#13;
(h)   Excavated material will be graded.&#13;
6.    Improper Drainage - Erosion and water logging due to improper drainage of overflow and&#13;
washout from leakage in water supply system components may occur. Improper drainage design&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 4&#13;
and maintenance undermine the construction components (concrete tanks and pipes) by a)&#13;
increasing erosion which destabilizes the foundation and exposes pipes; and b) subjecting the&#13;
structures to weathering which decrease the structural integrity. Poor drainage from tapstands&#13;
and handpumps may create localized ponding of water. Ponded water is a breeding ground for&#13;
bacteria and disease carrying insects. Additionally, well water is susceptible to contamination&#13;
from surface water run-off.&#13;
(a)    Adequate drainage system around the structures and sanitary storm drains must be&#13;
maintained. The community health and sanitation education program as well as the&#13;
village maintenance worker training incorporates the need and the know how for&#13;
maintaining functional drainage systems.&#13;
(b)    Washing and livestock drinking facilities will be installed a safe distance down hill&#13;
from the tapstand to avoid cross contamination. The Community Action Plan will&#13;
assess the need for such facilities and incorporate then in the design.&#13;
(c)    Adequate drainage for overflow and washouts from water supply system&#13;
components should be provided.&#13;
(d)   Drainage from tapstands and handpumps must drain to a safe place such as near a&#13;
field, kitchen garden or soakaway.&#13;
(e)    New drainage routes will be avoided.&#13;
7.    Source Selection and Tapping - Source pollution due to improper design and site&#13;
selection poses a serious environmental health problem. Contamination may be caused by bacteria&#13;
or agricultural chemicals. Other consequences of source tapping include changes in natural&#13;
vegetation and water reduction for wildlife and cattle. The source may also supply water to&#13;
persons not in the project area thereby impacting their health and economic growth.&#13;
(a)    Procedures for testing water quality (such as simple presence/absence of bacteria)&#13;
will be investigated in conjunction with sanitary inspection at source&#13;
(b)    Proper design of intake structure to ensure protection from pollution and possibly&#13;
enhance treatment (i.e. sandfilter).&#13;
(c)    Sources must be non-disputed sources and downstream users must be protected.&#13;
(d)   Catchment area should be protected from deforestation and encourage tree&#13;
plantation to avoid future source depletions.&#13;
8.    Latrine Construction and Sanitation - Improperly designed latrines which do not consider&#13;
soil type, water table or drainage patterns, could pollute ground water and surface waters. Poor&#13;
soils for pit latrines include clay soils which do not drain and rocky soils which drain too quickly.&#13;
Since clay soils are impermeable and do not drain, pits built in clay soils can flood bringing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
sewage to the surface and essentially shortening the life of the latrine. The impact is two fold;&#13;
first, pathogens are brought to the surface exposing persons to diseases; second, persons who&#13;
traditionally defecate in the open fields will have negative connotations towards pit latrines and go&#13;
back to unsanitary habits. In quick draining soils, like rocky soils, the liquid waste drains too&#13;
quickly not allowing the bacteria in the soil to breakdown the pollutants. As a result, pollutants&#13;
make their way to the groundwater.&#13;
(a)    Siting of latrines and technology selection must consider soil type, depth of water&#13;
table, drainage patterns in the area (i.e. no nearby water sources downstream from&#13;
the latrines).&#13;
(b)    Training on latrine siting and technology will be carried out.&#13;
(c)    The project incorporates sanitation education to explain the link between human&#13;
waste and disease and explain the need for proper disposal.&#13;
9.    Design and Construction - The quality of design and construction of systems is&#13;
paramount in delivering long lived schemes. If the intake structure collapses after one year, the&#13;
intended environmental benefit is not sustained. The breakdown of systems such as leaky tanks,&#13;
broken or cut lines and broken handpumps, usually means loss of water for those at or&#13;
downstream from the failed component.&#13;
(a)   It is essential that the quality be held at the highest possible standards and that&#13;
standards improve with time.&#13;
(b)    The monitoring program will provide feedback on which systems work best, what&#13;
problems were found and why(i.e. poor concrete mixture, improper curing, poor&#13;
maintenance, or even lack of community involvement).&#13;
(c)    The project has developed a set of technical manuals and technical training to&#13;
improve design and construction quality. These manuals and training modules&#13;
must reflect lessons learned in previous construction years, based on the&#13;
monitoring program, and continue to improve.&#13;
(d)   Location of Livestock stalls shall be a minimum of 20 meters from any structure.&#13;
10.  Induced Development and Water Use - Improved access and increased supply of water may&#13;
settlement areas may also result from improved supply. The ultimate result is&#13;
increased demand from a limited source. Community education and planning must&#13;
consider these issues.&#13;

RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
JANTA KO KHANE PANI RA SAFAI KARYAKRAM (JAKPAS):&#13;
Summary of Performance and Lessons of Experience&#13;
I.     This annex focuses on issues most germane to the design of the institutional and&#13;
financial arrangements for the Nepal Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (the&#13;
Project). Detailed findings regarding specific components (e.g. content of training&#13;
courses, etc.) are reflected in the draft Board Implementation Manual drafted by JAKPAS&#13;
and to be finalized and adopted by the Board.&#13;
Summary&#13;
2.     JAKPAS set out to test a large number of questions in a very brief period. It has&#13;
succeeded in demonstrating that the basic project framework is sound. Communities are&#13;
eager to make major contributions to secure water and sanitation schemes which are&#13;
2&#13;
economically and technically sound. They contributed 40% of scheme costs up front.&#13;
There are growing numbers of SOs which are able to assist communities to plan and&#13;
implement water and sanitation schemes. It was feasible for a small number of highly&#13;
qualified staff in JAKPAS to administer a large number of schemes by using efficient&#13;
information systems, by making optimal use of local consultants to handle specific tasks&#13;
and peak period work demands, and by employing clear criteria for scheme selection and&#13;
payment by results. JAKPAS itself has adapted its procedures and operations as lessons&#13;
were learned. The Jakpas experience has shown that the duration of the original scheme&#13;
cycle (12-18 months) was too short and that the scheme cycle should be extended to at&#13;
least 36 months. Monitoring and evaluation of all aspects of Board, SO and scheme&#13;
performance is essential to ensure sound future programs. An effective future program&#13;
can and should retain the "learning by doing" approach pioneered by JAKPAS.&#13;
Background and Objectives&#13;
3.     The basic objective of JAKPAS was to set up and test a trial Rural Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation Fund Development Board which would contract Support Organizations&#13;
(SOs), to assist communities to plan, implement, operate and maintain viable rural water&#13;
and sanitation schemes in a participatory fashion. Studies in 1991-2 with UNDP and&#13;
The objectives, work plan, status and fmdings to date of JAKPAS are set out in the nine Ouastley Progress Res orts coveing the peiod&#13;
fron project inoeption (March 12, 1993) to June 30, 1996. In additiu JAKPAS has issued a large number of reports on diffaert aspwts of its&#13;
operations, together with the draft Inplemer.tation mamlal for the Board These are contained m the project file (Annex 20). The pirnes review of&#13;
Jakpas Perfonmance and lessons leamned is based upon matenial contained in those reports and data in draft Project Conmpleion Reports for 29 frg&#13;
Batch projocts carried out whih 12 Support Organizations and draft SO accuznt reviewsr canied out for 28 SOs prepared in August-Septmnber 1995.&#13;
2&#13;
Scheme costs include: i) all labor (both skilled and unskilled); ii) all materials (both locally available and non locally&#13;
available); and iii) all transportation costs&#13;

Annex 13&#13;
Page 2 of 11&#13;
Japanese Grant Facility (JGF) funding, had established a prima facie case for developing&#13;
such an institution and the outline of a project approach.&#13;
4.    The central problem was that many previous supply-driven programs had failed to&#13;
provide sustained and sustainable water supply and sanitation services in the rural areas&#13;
(indeed, the initial approach by HMGN to IDA had been for a major project to rehabilitate&#13;
existing schemes, several of which had never delivered services.) The challenge was&#13;
therefore to design a delivery mechanism which would: (a) ensure full partnership of&#13;
beneficiary communities in all aspects of service delivery from project initiation to&#13;
operations and maintenance. This was required to ensure sustained improvements in&#13;
water supply and sanitation and consequent improvements in health and income; (b) make&#13;
effective use of the private sector, including non-government sector, to assist&#13;
communities, thus minimizing the drain on official budgets and administrative capacity,&#13;
and (c) identify large numbers of small dispersed and viable schemes without excessive&#13;
overhead cost.&#13;
5.    The following major JAKPAS sub-objectives were set out in the grant&#13;
application(s):&#13;
(a)   test and refine a variety of service delivery options (institutional and&#13;
socio-technical approaches) to be taken at local level, including approaches&#13;
which link women's organization, education and income with sustainable&#13;
water and sanitation service delivery;&#13;
(b)   refine the eligibility criteria for identification and selection of support&#13;
agencies and selection criteria for schemes;&#13;
(c)   based on the field testing of options, help define the funding mechanism&#13;
(financial and technical intermediary or Board) that will manage the Project&#13;
resources, including its policy and operations manuals and organizational&#13;
structure; and&#13;
(d)   under the two Japanese Grant Facilities (JGF) to prepare a pipeline of 125&#13;
schemes for implementation in the first year of the Project.&#13;
6.    JAKPAS started operations in March 1993 with funding from two Japanese&#13;
Facility grants, totaling approximately US$ 3.2 million equivalent. The first grant was&#13;
initially programmed to close December, 1994 (subsequently extended to April, 1995) and&#13;
the second planned to close on September 30, 1995 (extended to June, 1996).&#13;
Schemes Processed and Overall Performance&#13;
7.    JAKPAS has processed two "tranches" (hereafter "Batches") of schemes, and&#13;
identified a third Batch of around 102 schemes for consideration by the Board, as&#13;
summarized in Table 13.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 11&#13;
8.    About 101 SOs applied for prequalification under Batches One and Two, of which&#13;
56 met the pre-qualification criteria. These criteria comprised legal registration, a proven&#13;
track record (2 years experience) in rural development, capacity to engage appropriate&#13;
staff and satisfactory audited accounts. Twenty-four SOs were invited to submit schemes&#13;
for financing. The list was reduced from 56 to 24 in the light of the number of schemes&#13;
required for testing, and to test relative capacities of different types of SOs.&#13;

viable or required substantial additional work), but there was budget for only 39. It is expected&#13;

102 Schemes Batch 3.&#13;

* * ** Of which 24 different SOs were involved in Batches One and Two and five new SOs&#13;
were prequalified for Batch Three.&#13;
9.    For Batch Three, 226 SOs applied. By that time, experience had indicated the&#13;
need for more thorough review of SOs' past experience (which JAKPAS verified by field&#13;
visits to past schemes). About 60 SOs were judged potentially capable of preparing&#13;
schemes. The list was reduced to the strongest 25 SOs in order to secure the economies&#13;
from having each SO handle several schemes while not exceeding the target to prepare&#13;
about 100 schemes for Batch 3.&#13;
10.   As is apparent from the above table, there has been substantial attrition in scheme&#13;
numbers from one phase to another. While there have been a variety of reasons for this,&#13;
including failures by SOs and/or communities to mobilize sufficiently, over 80% of&#13;
"drops" have been due to water source issues. In most cases, the problems were&#13;
technical: inadequate flow and inability to find satisfactory alternative sources, or&#13;
inappropriate siting (e.g., source below population to be served). Disputes within the&#13;
community or with neighboring communities regarding the use of the source and lack of&#13;
alternatives has also been a factor in some drops, although the more normal situation is for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 4 of 11&#13;
source disputes to be resolved with some adjustment in numbers of households or service&#13;
levels. The prime lesson from this experience has been to require SOs to prepare more&#13;
thorough pre-feasibility studies and JAKPAS to carry out more rigorous site appraisals on&#13;
all schemes (rather than a sample). The pre-feasibility studies include source measurement&#13;
during the driest season, April/May, when flow rates are lowest)). This has resulted in&#13;
some increase in estimated project costs (for SO training, more site appraisal work) as&#13;
well as a lengthening of the scheme cycle. While attrition may be minimized by&#13;
appropriate measures, it cannot be eliminated, and so project costing allows for 13%&#13;
attrition between development and implementation.&#13;
I1.   As of June, 1996, construction is completed for 1 10 schemes and underway for 3&#13;
schemes for which training, health and sanitation and building community capacity for&#13;
operations and maintenance are still under way. In several instances schemes for which&#13;
construction was "complete" were not providing water due to poorly constructed intakes&#13;
or landslides. Corrective measures were taken and the problem corrected. In several&#13;
additional schemes, the quality of intakes and pipelines (trench depth, location, works at&#13;
river crossings) needed to be upgraded if the schemes were to achieve their expected 15 -&#13;
20 year service life. These problems have arisen partly from design defects, and partly&#13;
from poor construction quality. Both problems have been related to inadequate staff&#13;
inputs, in terms of quality and of time in the field during design and construction.&#13;
Corrective measures have been introduced for Batch 3. Evidence is not yet fully available&#13;
on how many completed schemes will be failures as regards their construction&#13;
components. However, all 1 10 schemes are currently delivering water as intended.&#13;
12.   Experience with the Community Development components has been mixed. The&#13;
initial project completion reports for Batch I schemes indicate doubt about the viability of&#13;
operations and maintenance arrangements (appointment of Village Maintenance Worker,&#13;
regular collection from households to pay his/her expenses, regular maintenance as&#13;
contrasted with repair of systems) in up to one half of Batch One schemes. While many&#13;
schemes exhibit impressive latrine construction, quality is deficient. While ex-post&#13;
Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) studies (carried out in 9 schemes) found&#13;
significant improvements in some health related behaviors (hand washing, bathing, latrine&#13;
use) in some communities, there was little improvement in others, and even the "best"&#13;
communities had much room for improvement. Responses to these problems imply&#13;
somewhat longer development and implementation phases, better definition of community&#13;
Development inputs, and more rigorous monitoring (discussed below). Appropriate&#13;
corrective measures have been introduced for Batch 3 schemes.&#13;
Hills/Terai&#13;
13.   Of the total 113 schemes for which implementation contracts have been signed, 95&#13;
are in the hills and 18 in the Terai. The reasons for the relatively low "demand" from the&#13;
Terai (compared with population, or official "coverage" figures) probably include: (a)&#13;
Terai schemes may be less attractive to SOs than gravity schemes, (b) fewer communities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 5 of 11&#13;
meet the eligibility criteria regarding demand and need. This could be due either to: (i)&#13;
few communities with high need, or (ii) excessive JAKPAS time savings as would occur if&#13;
initial cost were overestimated. JAKPAS criteria were based on recovering costs of the&#13;
relatively conventional "package" of new handpumps or dugwells. Some evidence&#13;
indicates that assistance with upgrading existing facilities and using lower-cost options&#13;
would prove more attractive, (c) failure by SOs to identify and develop schemes for the&#13;
most disadvantaged communities where the eligibility criteria would be met, (d) a larger&#13;
"communications gap" between JAKPAS (in Kathmandu) and communities and SOs in the&#13;
Terai than in the Hills, implying the need for special efforts to elicit interest from Terai&#13;
SOs. An early study is proposed to explore this issue, and to recommend improved&#13;
mechanisms for the Terai component.&#13;
Cycle Timing&#13;
14.   The three project phases were initially expected to be, respectively, 2-3 months, 4-&#13;
6 months, and 6-9 months, for a total scheme cycle of 12-18 months. No scheme has&#13;
achieved these targets. Some delays have resulted from a mismatch between the timing of&#13;
the grants and the seasons of Nepal. But more fundamentally, the calendar of seasons,&#13;
harvests and holidays, with their influence on accessibility of locations, availability of local&#13;
labor, and ability to construct, plus time needed to process proposals, imply a longer cycle&#13;
than assumed in earlier preparation studies. For gravity schemes, experience has&#13;
demonstrated that successful project completion must meet three climate-related&#13;
constraints: (a) measurement of source adequacy in the dry season (April/June), (b) start&#13;
of construction following harvest (November, say), and (c) completion of all construction&#13;
activities, including correction of faults, before the monsoon (say mid-June). These&#13;
constraints, plus time required to do the work of each phase, implies a scheme cycle on the&#13;
order of about 36 months of which about 23 would be under contract (compared with the&#13;
initial estimate of 10-15 months). For this reason a scheme cycle of 36 months has&#13;
been recommended for the Project. Length for Terai schemes requires additional study.&#13;
Eligibility Criteria&#13;
15.   Securing reliable information for decisions is perhaps the major single challenge&#13;
faced by any decentralized program. Earlier preparation work recommended defining&#13;
clear criteria for scheme selection if resources were to flow to communities in need, if&#13;
projects were indeed to improve the situation, and if program overhead costs were to be&#13;
minimnized. JAKPAS has tested the criteria defined for testing, and introduced several&#13;
improvements. The three most important lessons learned were that (a) the initially-&#13;
proposed criteria were fairly appropriate, (b) criteria need to be continuously reviewed and&#13;
updated in the light of experience from monitoring and evaluation, and (c) criteria in effect&#13;
for any particular Batch must be clearly stated and rigidly applied to minimize&#13;
uncertainties among SOs and communities. Specific lessons are noted under the three&#13;
main criteria: demand/economic viability, technical feasibility and sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 6 of l1&#13;
16.   Felt need/Economic Viability: This criterion was considered to be met if estimated&#13;
daily time saving per household were large enough to yield a benefit/ cost ratio of 1.5 for&#13;
estimated average scheme construction costs. (A ratio of 1.5 was to allow for risk, and&#13;
costs of Community Development and program overheads). In the hills, this implied a&#13;
time saving of 2 hours per household per day, and in the Terai one half hour (Shallow&#13;
Tube Wells). For schemes with average cost above a defined threshold, they should show&#13;
a B/C ratio of 1. 5, or initial consumption under 15 I/c/d or more than 50% of households&#13;
depending exclusively on heavily polluted sources. Experience has yielded three major&#13;
lessons. First, SOs remain largely unconvinced of the importance of the "need" criteria.&#13;
Hence, JAKPAS has had to increase the rigor with which it verifies need indicators during&#13;
site appraisals. Second, it has proven infeasible to reject a scheme following the&#13;
development phase on the basis of "need/economic viability" criteria alone. The extent&#13;
and quality of the pre-feasibility study and pre-development phase site-appraisal have&#13;
therefore had to be augmented to permit a more reliable judgement on need and economic&#13;
viability. Thirdly, some First Batch schemes may have had inadequate time-saving (there&#13;
was only sample site appraisal, and then rather cursory). But Batch Two and Batch Three&#13;
experience indicates no shortage of communities which would potentially benefit from&#13;
economically viable schemes. Even if the thresholds must be raised (to reflect expected&#13;
increased scheme costs), there is no doubt that demand will exceed capacity to meet it for&#13;
the foreseeable future.&#13;
17.   Technical Feasibility: Technical feasibility criteria comprise (a) adequate source&#13;
yield and availability of an undisputed source (discussed above); (b) relatively unpolluted&#13;
source or availability of in-home treatment. In-home treatment is a subject proposed for&#13;
study during the project to determine if in-home treatment can work and, if so, how; (c)&#13;
adherence to stated service levels, with communities to pay the full cost of higher service&#13;
levels. This criterion is proving difficult to administer, as there are enormous pressures to&#13;
increase tapstands over the number designed; and (d) consistency with established Board&#13;
engineering standards. The main emerging issue concerns how best to incorporate the&#13;
remnants of other systems in scheme design. The engineering standards have been&#13;
developed largely by various donor supported projects to construct new schemes. This is&#13;
manifestly inappropriate to the Terai where there may be opportunities to upgrade existing&#13;
private technologies or facilities. Developing robust procedures to upgrade or make use&#13;
of existing facilities in the Hills and Terai will require a higher level of skill and different&#13;
orientation to that implied by past practice, and appropriate modification to design&#13;
manuals. Difficulties with landslides during the first two Batches also suggest the need for&#13;
more systematic review of possible landslide risk in judging viability of schemes or in&#13;
designs adopted. Construction practices and training need improvement, specifically: (a)&#13;
locating structures in appropriate areas (i.e. spring boxes to the side of the stream not&#13;
directly in the stream); (b) hydraulic designs need to ensure break pressure tanks, tap-&#13;
stands and reservoirs allow the water to flow evenly through the community; (c) drainage&#13;
around the structures need to flow away from the structure; (d) water, cement, sand and&#13;
aggregate ratios need better quality control to ensure strong cement/concrete mixtures;&#13;
and (e) sanitation technologies, including siting of latrines and understanding soil types,&#13;
need improvement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 7 of 11&#13;
18.   Sustainability: The sustainability criterion consists of: (a) willingness of the&#13;
community to contribute all local materials, porterage and unskilled labor, a percentage of&#13;
construction cost (initially 1% for the Hills, but raised to about 2.5% in Batch 3, and 10%&#13;
for the Terai, subsequently raised to 20%), and to contribute to an O&amp;M fund (3% of&#13;
gravity scheme and dugwell cost, 4% of shallow tubewell and deep tubewell); (b)&#13;
contribution of 100% of the incremental cost of implementing higher than standard service&#13;
levels; (c) registration of a water users group; and (d) development of satisfactory plans&#13;
for future O&amp;M. Sustainability at pre-feasibility stage is assessed on the basis of&#13;
judgements about community willingness to participate (point (a)). Actual contributions,&#13;
plus evidence of fulfillment of the other indicators is required before signing&#13;
implementation phase contracts. Experience has completely dispelled earlier uncertainties&#13;
regarding community willingness to pay. Communities contributed about 38% and 40% in&#13;
the First and Second Batches respectively towards construction (materials and equipment,&#13;
skilled and unskilled labor and transportation) costs. They raised additional amounts for&#13;
Operations and Maintenance. Defining appropriate user groups in the Terai still requires&#13;
attention (since co-operation on a wider scale than the users of a specific well or pump is&#13;
difficult to organize).&#13;
Service Delivery Options and Lessons&#13;
19.   It was initially expected that individual SOs would implement different packages&#13;
(Non-formal education, different approaches to health and sanitation education,&#13;
stimulating womens' activities, etc.). An evaluation of differing programs would enable&#13;
adoption of successful options through a process of cross fertilization and emulation.&#13;
JAKPAS also developed a series of tools designed to stimulate community action planning&#13;
and carried out training of SO staff in their use so as to foster full community participation&#13;
in all phases, and hence "ownership" and sustainability of schemes. The application of&#13;
these tools was left to the discretion of the SOs. Some JAKPAS community action&#13;
planning tools have subsequently been used successfully by NGOs in other sectors. There&#13;
have not been enough ex-post evaluations of scheme performance to indicate the relative&#13;
usefulness of different specific interventions in producing sustainable schemes or improved&#13;
health practices. Moreover, judgements on the efficacy of different packages is hindered&#13;
by uncertainties about just what packages have been implemented in some cases (as&#13;
discussed further below). In response to these difficulties, JAKPAS has tended to&#13;
standardize the packages, and types and levels of inputs to be financed (health training,&#13;
women's support services, option for Non-Formal Education during development phase&#13;
only, etc.). Despite such standardization, there will undoubtedly be differences in program&#13;
emphases and impacts with implications for future scheme design.&#13;
Performance of Communities. SOs and JAKPAS&#13;
20.   The weaknesses--and successes-- in outcomes mentioned earlier arise as much&#13;
from the nature of the inter-actions between communities, SOs, and JAKPAS as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page 8 of 11&#13;
actions of any one of these parties. For descriptive purposes it is convenient to describe&#13;
the problems in terms of each actor, however.&#13;
Community Performance&#13;
21.   JAKPAS has demonstrated that the vast majority of communities are prepared to&#13;
contribute substantial time and cash to secure sustainable water supplies. Many&#13;
communities have also demonstrated a willingness to make social changes (e.g. enable&#13;
women to take decision-making roles beside men in managing water schemes) to improve&#13;
water services. It was known from the start that communities would need assistance to&#13;
overcome basic ignorance (e.g. on technical matters and health practices) and lack of&#13;
traditions for co-operation in creation and maintenance of common facilities. To the extent&#13;
that there is room for improvements in community performance, experience to date&#13;
indicates that they must be sought through more effective measures by SOs and JAKPAS&#13;
to build capacity and seek balance with communities.&#13;
SO Performance and Lessons&#13;
22.   There was major initial uncertainty as to whether SOs would be prepared to co-&#13;
operate with JAKPAS in a fairly highly structured environment of eligibility criteria, tight&#13;
implementation periods, and payment according to performance. In these circumstances,&#13;
the strategy of Batch One was to give maximum autonomy to SOs to accomplish results&#13;
(from which lessons could be drawn). JAKPAS took measures to correct specific&#13;
problems which arose, especially in supplementing weak technical capacity of some SOs.&#13;
These measures were non-replicable for the future, but were useful during the learning&#13;
phase.&#13;
23.   JAKPAS selected a variety of SO types to test their relative competencies. They&#13;
included an International NGO (INGO) which supervised community based organizations&#13;
(CBOs) which would not have met SO eligibility criteria on their own) national level&#13;
NGOs which have operations in several districts, district level (and regional level) NGOs&#13;
with operations in single districts or contiguous districts, Local NGOs typically working in&#13;
part of a district and private firms which had undertaken development work.&#13;
24.   While there were substantial differences in performance among SOs, they were not&#13;
systematically associated with any SO type. The expectation that local NGOs would have&#13;
fuller communications with communities and stimulate wider local participation was borne&#13;
out only in part. The demonstrated past ability of the national NGOs to engage competent&#13;
staff was not reflected in superior field performance under JAKPAS. The following&#13;
weaknesses were sufficiently widespread in Batch One to require systematic remedies in&#13;
Batch Two and in the future:&#13;
(a)   Weak community management, as exhibited by failure to carry out&#13;
community action planning meaningfully, a tendency of some SOs to deal&#13;
with small groups in the community or even to designate water users'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

committees, failure to plan activities jointly with the community,&#13;
insufficient involvement of community in design of schemes and in handling&#13;
funds and procuring goods (including goods procured with cash&#13;
contributions from communities), and failure to train WUC committees.&#13;
(b)   Inadequate technical capacity of SO field staff (in Community&#13;
Development and Construction). This was in some cases due to&#13;
inadequate initial qualifications, but also failure by the SO to provide staff&#13;
with appropriate training. In some cases, SO staff trained by JAKPAS&#13;
were not assigned to the field, or failed to pass on the results of their&#13;
training to field staff. In other cases, skill gaps have been identified which&#13;
need to be filled. An important gap concerns lack of skills by design staff&#13;
to integrate the community into the design process. The requirement for&#13;
communities to contribute a percentage of project cost was partly to induce&#13;
more accountability by designers to community preferences. In many&#13;
cases, the designers themselves are unable to design and cost alternatives&#13;
which meet basic engineering standards, as contrasted with costing a single&#13;
system based on the design manual.&#13;
(c)   Insufficient field time by SO staff. This was a major factor in poor&#13;
construction executed by communities without technical supervision. This&#13;
failure was reflected in poor or non-existent records on staff disposition at&#13;
SO headquarters.&#13;
25.   The principal solutions to the above problems follow clearly from their description&#13;
and several have already been introduced in Batch Two. They include: more attention by&#13;
JAKPAS to managing its portfolio managers and to the qualifications of staff assigned by&#13;
SOs, training to fill gaps in experience, more detailed programming of work inputs and&#13;
outputs to provide clearer performance monitoring indicators, more detailed contractual&#13;
performance requirements for receiving payments, better SO record keeping and audit of&#13;
accounts on previous contracts before signing new ones.&#13;
26.   To increase SO accountability to communities, communities are now being&#13;
requested to fill time sheets for SO staff inputs before contract payments. It has also been&#13;
decided that SOs would establish joint accounts with Water User Committees for&#13;
construction costs during implementation phase so as to stimulate more transparency and&#13;
ensure cooperation in implementation.&#13;
27.   The various weaknesses listed above are not universal. JAKPAS has&#13;
demonstrated the existence of many SOs able to fulfill scheme responsibilities. Moreover,&#13;
through its operations, JAKPAS has substantially increased capacity of several SOs to&#13;
participate in future schemes. It is likely that as tighter compliance monitoring is&#13;
accepted, it will be possible for JAKPAS to increase its attention to monitoring the&#13;
effectiveness of different packages.&#13;

JAKPAS Performance&#13;
28.   JAKPAS accomplishments in terms of completed schemes, refined criteria,&#13;
management tools and establishing a viable organization during a very brief period are&#13;
impressive. Even if these accomplishments could not have been bettered in the past,&#13;
however, several lessons for future improvement have been incorporated into Project&#13;
design.&#13;
29.   JAKPAS Organization: JAKPAS has adopted an operational organization and&#13;
staffing which should be suitable for the Board. It is managed by the Chief Technical&#13;
Advisor who reports to the World Bank which is responsible for administering the&#13;
Japanese Grant Facility. This is the principal difference between JAKPAS and the Board,&#13;
since the Executive Director of the Board will report to the Board. JAKPAS has&#13;
established an Advisory Committee of HMGN and private sector members with similar&#13;
qualifications to those expected for the Board, but with advisory rather than decision&#13;
authority.&#13;
30.   The Chief Technical Advisor (CTA) is assisted by the National Advisor who acts&#13;
as his deputy. The detailed organization has evolved from 1993 to 1996, and its latest&#13;
form is proposed for the Board.&#13;
31.   Initially, all operations staff (including the CTA) had responsibilities as portfolio&#13;
managers responsible for overseeing all aspects of contracts with individual SOs and&#13;
communities together with functional responsibilities. This "matrix" pattern proved&#13;
difficult to sustain as the scale of JAKPAS operations expanded. Three Portfolio&#13;
Managers retain some functional responsibilities for JAKPAS-wide operations (Gender,&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E), and Health and Sanitation Education (HSE)).&#13;
32.   Unit Heads and the relevant Portfolio Manager participate in the Staff Technical&#13;
Appraisal Committee (STAC) which meets under the National Advisor and reviews&#13;
pre-qualifications of SOs as well as suitability of each proposed scheme and recommends&#13;
acceptance or rejection to the Chief Technical Advisor.&#13;
33.   Adequate field supervision of SOs and schemes requires use of substantial numbers&#13;
of professional staff which vary over the project cycle. Numbers have ranged from 5 (at&#13;
the commencement of JAKPAS) to 58 (during the peak activities in mid-1995). As of end&#13;
September, 1995, 44 professionals were engaged either in central management functions&#13;
or some aspect of scheme supervision, monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
34.   JAKPAS has demonstrated that it is possible to engage staff with the qualifications&#13;
and experience required to manage a program of this type. Heavy reliance was placed&#13;
initially on engaging regular staff at United Nations rates (as required under IDA-&#13;
administered programs), and the number of staff on these terms peaked at 20 in September&#13;
1994. Subsequently, in order to avoid bureaucratic bloat, to tailor staffing to changing&#13;
needs, to promote increased accountability for performance, and to minimize costs while&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
Page II of II&#13;
ensuring quality of manpower, more reliance has been placed on professionals from SAs&#13;
contracted to supply professional inputs on an as-needed basis. As of end-September,&#13;
1995, there were 9 regular staff (including the CTA and National Advisor), and 35&#13;
temporary SA staff.&#13;
3 5.   JAKPAS has developed an efficient computerized Management Information&#13;
System. This is essential for managing a large number of contracts with minimal central&#13;
staff This system should continue to evolve. There remains scope for additional training&#13;
of all professional staff to take full advantage of the system. JAKPAS has also issued a&#13;
series of technical guidelines and manuals which set out in detail all the procedures&#13;
(including rationales, forms, actions, draft contracts, drawings, etc.) required for Board&#13;
operations (Annex 20).&#13;
36.   Portfolio Management: As noted above, JAKPAS has defined more clearly the&#13;
content of SO contracts to enable more effective performance monitoring. In addition,&#13;
there is a need to enhance multi-disciplinary competence by monitoring staff to ensure&#13;
maximum effectiveness in advising SOs and communities in the field (e.g., "social" staff&#13;
have had to learn more about technical aspects of schemes, and vice versa). Timeliness of&#13;
JAKPAS field monitoring has also been a problem. This has been addressed through&#13;
engagement of SAs, including SAs based in regional centers. Lack of continuity in&#13;
supervision staff to particular SOs and schemes has also caused some confusion but has&#13;
been reduced through better planning of portfolio management activities.&#13;
37.   While Communities, SOs, and JAKPAS are joint signatories to implementation&#13;
phase contracts, the JAKPAS relationship with communities has been largely through&#13;
intermediary SOs. Administrative feasibility precludes JAKPAS dealing individually on all&#13;
matters with each community. Nevertheless, there is a case for seeking a better balance in&#13;
the JAKPAS-community relationship. Various methods are being tested, including having&#13;
communities approve SO time sheets, placing more emphasis on tri-partite contract&#13;
signing ceremonies, and requiring more systematic contact with communities by JAKPAS&#13;
monitoring personnel.&#13;
38.   Monitoring and Evaluation: The main emphasis has been on performance&#13;
monitoring of contracts by portfolio staff. The initial set of Project Completion Reports&#13;
were prepared by independent SAs. These, together with the reports on SO accounts&#13;
undertaken by an independent accounting firm, have proven invaluable in reviewing&#13;
overall performance, and identifying issues requiring attention. The usefulness of these&#13;
reports fully justifies the proposal for independent technical and financial audits. Impact&#13;
monitoring has so far received relatively little attention compared with implementation&#13;
monitoring, in part because so few schemes have been completed. KAP studies of 9&#13;
communities (base-line and ex-post) have provided some tantalizing data. There is a need&#13;
to enhance the attention given to impact monitoring in completion reports (this was&#13;
unaccountably excluded from TORs for the first project completion reports). The Board&#13;
will clearly benefit from devoting adequate resources to monitoring and evaluation and&#13;
periodic special studies on various aspects.&#13;

RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Support Organizations and Service Agencies&#13;
I.    The institutional partners of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation  Fund&#13;
Development Board are classified into 2 broad functional categories:   Support&#13;
Organizations (SO), and Service Agencies (SA). These include NGOs, community based&#13;
organizations, and private groups. A comparative assessment of institutions available for&#13;
rural water supply and sanitation service delivery was made based on a review of a sample&#13;
of organizations engaged in RWSS activities and experience from the JAKPAS pilot&#13;
project.&#13;
A. Support Organizations&#13;
2.     Support Organizations (SOs) are organizations that would assist participating&#13;
communities to implement their water supply and sanitation schemes. They include non-&#13;
gyvernmental organizations, commnunity based organizations, and private sector firms. The&#13;
role of the SO would be to facilitate and enable communities to take a leading role in the&#13;
decision making process concerning the identification, design, implementation and&#13;
operation and maintenance of their Rural Water Supply and Sanitation schemes.&#13;
Non governmental Organizations&#13;
3     Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are classified into 5 categories based on&#13;
ability to undertake activities in one or several districts. These include national, central,&#13;
district, local, and international NGOs. Non-governmental organizations are typically&#13;
managed by a volunteer executive Board consisting of 7-11 members each with a&#13;
designated position. Board members are responsible for negotiating with funding agencies&#13;
and supervising implementation. Many NGO members are socio-politically motivated and&#13;
enjoy considerable influence within their own community. There is also a tendency for&#13;
NGO leaders to develop patron-client relationships with their beneficiaries. The more&#13;
closed an area the more intense these relationships appear to be. NGOs whose Board&#13;
members consist of professionals are more development oriented, employ skilled personnel&#13;
and rely less on voluntary work. Between 12,000-15,000 NGOs are reported to operate in&#13;
Nepal. Of the 6,000 registered under the Society Registration Act, about 3,400 are&#13;
registered under the Social Welfare Act (SWC).&#13;
4     National NGOs. About 18 national organizations have chapters in most if not all&#13;
75 districts. They generally have a well institutionalized management structure and are&#13;
often bureaucratic. As a result projects are often target oriented. They provide services on a&#13;
national scale through their district based branches by mobilizing voluntary workers and a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144 -&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
few paid staff. Elected branch executive members manage professional and voluntary&#13;
workers who are recruited to carry out its activities. The Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS)&#13;
with chapters in all 75 districts is the leading NGO in the water sector with 10 years of&#13;
experience. Many chapters of NRCS have considerable experience in constructing water&#13;
supplies. For instance, NRCS of Kavre district in the JAKPAS pilot project have&#13;
implemented 60 water supply schemes. The Family Planning Association of Nepal (FPAN)&#13;
as well as Nepal Jaycees and Lions Club operate in 24 districts. Their absorptive capacity is&#13;
high as evidenced by their linkages with international networks. Their major strength is the&#13;
availability of sector specific expertise and a well established network.&#13;
5     Central NGOs. These are organizations that operate in more than one district from&#13;
the center (Kathmandu) through fielding of supervisory and field staff. To date, more than&#13;
75 are registered under the SWC. Organizations working under the Jakpas pilot project&#13;
include Support Activities for Poor Producers of Nepal (SAPPROS), Institute for Integrated&#13;
Development Studies (IIDS), and Forum for Environment and Development (FED).&#13;
Central NGOs are observed to implement projects on behalf of beneficiaries. In addition a&#13;
few conduct research and development studies while some are observed to act as facilitators&#13;
for the development of locally based organizations. A major advantage is their ability to&#13;
procure skilled professionals on demand, and to serve as a bridge between the Board and&#13;
grassroots organizations.&#13;
6     District NGOs.  District NGOs are organizations that operate in several Village&#13;
Development Committees (VDCs) of one or more districts such as Tamakosi Sewa Samiti&#13;
(TSS), Samaj Sewa Samooh (SSS) and Society of Local Volunteers Efforts (SOLVE) in the&#13;
pilot project. More than 500 organizations are registered in this category. They undertake a&#13;
wide range of activities in different sectors including water supplies, health and sanitation,&#13;
NFE, agroforestry, animal husbandry, environment, family planning and income generating&#13;
activities. District NGOs are more likely to increase the number of activities in a particular&#13;
district than provide sector specific services to different districts. A few district NGOs such&#13;
as SOLVE operate in more than one district and display characteristics similar to the central&#13;
NGOs but are less able to appropriate qualified personnel on demand.&#13;
7     Local NGOs.  There is great diversity in terms of experience and technical&#13;
competence within this category of NGOs. Some tend to be very small and have the&#13;
characteristics of CBOs (see para 9) while others provide services to one or more VDCs.&#13;
There are more than 600 local NGOs registered under the SWC. In the pilot project CBO&#13;
type local NGOs include Sunkosi Yuva Club (SYC) and Samaj Kalyan Kendra (SKK);&#13;
while those providing services other than to their immediate community include Paropkar&#13;
Prathmik Upachar Kendra (PPUK), and Dhanusa Sewa Samiti (DSS). Local NGOs enjoy&#13;
good rapport with the community and are able to render micro-assistance. Smaller local&#13;
NGOs do not have good book keeping practices which are required for larger projects&#13;
although they keep records of financial resources mobilized internally such as membership&#13;
fees, and proceeds from charity and cultural activities. One weakness of the majority of&#13;
local NGOs is that most of their staff are volunteers. They have few technical resources or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 145 -&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
expertise within their membership. Only a few are able to recruit technicians on contract or&#13;
tap technical assistance from the district line agencies.&#13;
8.    International NGOs. About 6 INGOs have been identified as potential SOs.&#13;
Helvetas is the largest INGO effort in the sector. Since 1976, it has implemented a total of&#13;
about 315 drinking water schemes mostly in the western region. It is also involved in water&#13;
quality monitoring and training in various aspects of water supply development such as&#13;
technical training, basic Water Supply &amp; Sanitation training, health education, etc. Save the&#13;
Children Federation/USA was the first INGO to use non-formal education as an entry point&#13;
in its community development activities. Red Bama supports water supply, health&#13;
education, irrigation, forestry, agriculture, non-formal education, and income generating&#13;
activities. Lutheran World Service (LWS) have been functioning as an SA in different parts&#13;
of the country supporting other local organizations. More recently it has worked directly&#13;
with informal community groups with the intention that these groups would become&#13;
registered as local NGOs.&#13;
Community-Based Organizations/Informal Groups&#13;
9.    CBO/informal groups are generally informal organizations and their members are&#13;
themselves beneficiaries of their activities. Three types of CBOs are identified based on&#13;
origin. They include indigenous, self help and extemally formed CBOs. Indigenous CBOs&#13;
are informal groups that have evolved over one hundred years without outside assistance to&#13;
organize social life, pool labor, resources and express common interests and concems.&#13;
Indigenous cooperative groups are specific to a particular ethnic group, caste or community.&#13;
Self help organizations serve different functions, such as social groups, labor, and credit&#13;
associations. Informal credit association such as Dhikur exist among the Tibeto-Burman&#13;
speaking groups. Self help user groups have been formed to carry out specific development&#13;
activities and manage resources within communities. Membership in self-help groups is&#13;
based on residence and utilization of resources. Examples of strong self help groups are the&#13;
forestry user and several drinking water user groups.&#13;
10.     Externally  formed  CBOs evolved  during the implementation  of the&#13;
Decentralization Act of 1982 which made user groups as the focal point for development&#13;
activities. User group formation was imposed as a national policy managed by an executive&#13;
committee. As a result, majority of the user groups were formed without the users being&#13;
aware of its objectives and functions. Many of the beneficiaries perceive the formation as a&#13;
mere requirement to obtain external funds. The largest number of externally formed user&#13;
groups were reported to to be in the drinking water sub-sector.&#13;
11.   Indigenous and self-help CBOs are centers of community interaction and the focal&#13;
point of decision making. They are able to mobilize financial and human resources, and are&#13;
willing to undertake responsibilities to the project. For activities limited to the beneficiary&#13;
community the informal accounting system is perceived as appropriate and sufficient to&#13;
ensure financial transparency. There is a growing trend among CBOs within a locality to&#13;
form an association with a more formal structure to improve services to their members.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
CBO associations show considerable potential to function as SOs as they would be able to&#13;
utilize resources more efficiently than individual CBOs. Individual CBOs apppear to have&#13;
the capacity to implement one drinking water scheme per year.&#13;
Private Sector Firms&#13;
12.   Private Sector firms are for profit entities that may comprise the following: i) private&#13;
partnerships which are traditional consulting firms formed by several individuals offering&#13;
specialized knowledge and skills; ii) private limited companies. These tend to be traditional&#13;
consulting firms but usually include most construction companies which supply and&#13;
construct infrastructure building and other hardware; iii) engineering consultants which&#13;
include individuals and firms focussing on technical areas such as civil engineering,&#13;
technology transfer, construction and operation and maintenance; and iv) management and&#13;
training consultants providing professional management services to other organizations&#13;
including CBOs. All the above have traditionally offered a package of services ranging&#13;
from management, training and financial advice to planning and engineering feasibility&#13;
studies, to detailed design and specifications. A number of private firms could serve as SO&#13;
in the project as demonstrated under the JAKPAS pilot project.&#13;
13.   Selection of Support Organizations. To date, a total of 29 SOs have participated&#13;
under the Jakpas pilot project. They represent centrally based, district, and local NGOs,&#13;
CBOs, private firms and chapters of national NGOs, and an INGO. Support Organizations&#13;
have shown an inclination to work in areas where they have previously operated. Often&#13;
these are communities where the heads of NGO leaders or Board members have their roots.&#13;
As a result they enjoy considerable influence in these communities and have a "head start"&#13;
in terms of mobilizing the community.&#13;
14.   In communities where SOs are already operating they usually have requests for&#13;
water supplies on file. In others, SOs have identified communities where it felt there was a&#13;
need for improved supplies.  In communities served by the pilot project, SOs range from&#13;
marginalized groups (where there exists few basic resources and hard to reach communities)&#13;
to those easier to assist and located in accessible areas. Local NGOs are observed to be&#13;
based within a short distance of their target communities. District and centrally based NGOs&#13;
are stationed either at district headquarters or in Kathmandu.&#13;
15.    The assessment of SOs as partners for the Project indicates there would be at least&#13;
25 qualified SOs who would undertake between 100-125 schemes in the Project's first&#13;
Batch of schemes. Criteria for selecting SOs would identify organizations that have the&#13;
potential to undertake effective community based Rural Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
schemes. All potential SOs would fill a prequalification form which would have&#13;
information on but not limited to sector(s) in which the organization operates and&#13;
specialization of activities, district(s) in which it operates, scale of operations, staffing in&#13;
terms of managerial and technical skills and registration status. Criteria would ensure that&#13;
SOs selected have the technical capacity (community development and construction) to&#13;
undertake community based Rural Water Supply and Sanitation schemes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147 -&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
B. Service Agencies&#13;
16.   Service Agencies (SAs) comprise institutions and private groups that would provide&#13;
services to the Board in areas such as communications material production, material supply,&#13;
training (software and hardware), technical site appraisal, monitoring and evaluation and&#13;
conducting special studies and impact assessments. The Board supports a core training&#13;
program in 5 areas to enable SOs to more effectively perform their function as support&#13;
organizations. The role of SAs would be to provide training services in areas such as&#13;
approaches to community planning and monitoring, hygiene and sanitation education,&#13;
survey, design and cost estimates and financial management, and assisting the Board in&#13;
conducting site appraisal and monitoring of schemes undertaken by beneficiary&#13;
communities with support from Support Organizations.&#13;
17.   Service Agencies are broadly categorized into 4 areas: training, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, material development and suppliers and manufacturers. An assessment of&#13;
Service Agencies indicate most private training institutions are able to organize specialized&#13;
courses for particular clients as they have demonstrated capacity to recruit appropriate&#13;
personnel for particular tasks. The Jakpas pilot project has to date solicited the services of&#13;
about 15 SAs to provide inputs to SOs in hardware (eg., site appraisal), financial&#13;
management training and direct support to the pilot project management on auditing,&#13;
management information system, legal, and general management.&#13;
SAs for Traiing&#13;
18.   Training is offered through government line agencies, bilateral and multilateral&#13;
donors, national and international NGOs and private training institutions. Some training&#13;
organizations conduct training only on hardware such as plumbing, ferrocement tank&#13;
construction and O&amp;M, while others on NFE, HSE, leadership building, and financial and&#13;
management training. The capacity of government training institutions to offer services to&#13;
the project is limited, both by the regular workload of their staff and bureaucratic&#13;
procedures involved in providing incentives for government staff. Staff assessment of a&#13;
sample of organizations engaged in training indicate that INGOs and private training&#13;
institutions are better able to expand their training capacity to meet demand.&#13;
Material Development&#13;
19.   There is only a handful of organizations that are capable of producing participatory&#13;
materials to support Rural Water Supply and Sanitation related activities. A few develop&#13;
health and NFE materials for neo-literates while some train government and&#13;
nongovernmental organizations on primary health care. The Health Education Section of&#13;
the MOH is responsible for producing health education materials. The section has not been&#13;
able to recruit personnel with creative abilities to produce innovative work. Organizations&#13;
with qualified staff although few in number are available. They would be able to develop&#13;
&#13;

materials for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation related activities with guidance on content&#13;
and material presentation.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
20.   The organizations involved in these services include private consulting firms, and&#13;
national and international nongovernmental organizations. There are many qualified private&#13;
firms that would be able to appraise schemes for the Board, conduct formal evaluation of&#13;
projects and/or special studies. Many would also be able to provide technical personnel to&#13;
assist SOs to design and construct water supply schemes. Government line agencies are&#13;
primarily involved in conducting monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of their own programs&#13;
and generally do not render services to others.&#13;
Suppliers of Construction Materials&#13;
21.   Private manufacturing firms are able to complement government service delivery&#13;
systems. Most manufacturers conform to ISI standards but there is wide variety in the type&#13;
and quality of handpumps and fittings available in the market. Pipes are available on the&#13;
market as evidenced by the pilot project experience which demonstrates that materials are&#13;
being delivered within 2 weeks of placing order. The analysis of SAs providing&#13;
construction components indicates there is sufficient capacity in Nepal to meet the&#13;
requirements of the Project for pipes and handpumps. The one area in which Nepali&#13;
producers are weak is in fittings, the bulk of which continue to be imported from India.&#13;
C. Support Organization-Service Agency&#13;
22.   Support Organization Service Agency (SOSA) are organizations that combine&#13;
aspects of Support Organization (SO) and Service Agency (SA) working jointly in&#13;
partnership with communities and at the same time offering technical services to other&#13;
agencies. A number of them have begun to share their expertise by offering training and&#13;
technical services to other SOs, bilateral, multilateral, other INGOs and the Government.&#13;
As a group, SOSAs represent a fairly strong set of institutions. SOSAs involved in Rural&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation typically have specialized staff in community development,&#13;
HSE and engineering and are able to provide training to their field staff and to other&#13;
organizations as well.&#13;
23.   Of the potential SOSAs reviewed, HELVETAS which has a more intensive&#13;
program to enhance women's participation spend a longer time in assessing needs and&#13;
organizing the community. Compared to the SOs reviewed SOSAs give more emphasis to&#13;
the software component and HSE in particular, is more integrated with water supplies. In&#13;
the JAKPAS pilot project, organizations that fit into this category are the centrally based&#13;
NGOs, INGOs, and private firms (eg., HELVETAS, DEVTEC). Two examples of NGOs&#13;
working with local NGO partners at the same time offers services to other NGOs and&#13;
INGOs are the South Asia Partnership Nepal (SAP-Nepal), and the Rural Development&#13;

RUJRAL, WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJIFCT&#13;
Technical Criteria&#13;
Intoduction&#13;
1.    This technical annex summnarizes the design parameters recommended for use in the&#13;
Nepal Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board-Implementation&#13;
(Technical) Manuals listed in Attachment 1. All design criteria shall meet the environment&#13;
criteria in Annex 12.&#13;
2.    The project would incorporate an interactive planning process involving&#13;
communities and support organizations and would support the construction/rehabilitation of&#13;
900 gravity and tubewellldugwell schemes to serve an estimated design population of&#13;
550,000 in the hills and mountains and the terai.&#13;
3.    The project would provide appropriate sanitation facilities to approximately 40% of&#13;
project households in the hills and 50% in the terai through grants for a community&#13;
managed small revolving fund to provide loans for latrine construction, and a small&#13;
Institutional latrine component for selected schools and institutions such as health centres to&#13;
maximize demonstration effects.&#13;
Water Supply&#13;
4.    Types of Schemes: The Project would support the construction/rehabilitation&#13;
(making use, where feasible, structures/pipelines of existing systems that meet or are&#13;
rehabilitated to meet the technical standards) of schemes that meet the eligibility criteria as&#13;
set out in the Board Rules. The broad type of schemes in the mountains/hills comprise: (i)&#13;
gravity systems (open/closed) with spring/stream sources designed and operated for&#13;
continuous supply; and (ii) spring/kuwa protection. Schemes in the terai are: (i) tubewells&#13;
(possibly including deep tubewells under exceptional circumstances); and (ii) dugwells.&#13;
Catchment protection is also provided under the project.&#13;
5.    The Project would support schemes (built to a high standard of works in adherence&#13;
to the specification set out in the technical manuals) that meet the service level defined&#13;
below in section 10.8. If the community opts for service levels higher than this, the Project&#13;
would still support the scheme provided that the community bears the full additional cost&#13;
resulting from the higher service level and ensure satisfactory measures to prevent wastage&#13;
of water for example from private connections. Quality control aspects would also be&#13;
looked into under monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 15&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
6.    The Project would fund, as the least cost means of providing safe water to the&#13;
community, the protection of existing polluted springs/kuwas if the proposed scheme does&#13;
not meet the need and economic eligibility criteria (i.e. no or little time savings). If a&#13;
community requests for a piped water supply instead of the identified spring/kuwa&#13;
protection works, the Project would provide grant funding for the scheme at levels&#13;
estimated for the least cost solution provided the community agrees to pay the additional&#13;
cost (over and above the spring protection) required for it to have the pipe water supply&#13;
system.&#13;
7.    Safe Yield. Source yield measurements are critical for sustainable water supply&#13;
schemes. Ideally sources for gravity systems should be measured over a period of a time in&#13;
the driest months. Sources would be measured at least once at the end of the dry season&#13;
during May and June and preferably twice (the two measurements being made in different&#13;
years) prior to construction. If the cumulative yield of sources is less than 0.1 I/s, such&#13;
sources shall not be selected.&#13;
8.    Pipeline,&#13;
8.1   Pipe Materials generally used in rural water supply schemes in Nepal are&#13;
locally manufactured high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes which come in&#13;
pressure ratings of 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, 6.0 and 1 0.0 kg/sq.cm. The pipes normally used are&#13;
4.0, 6.0 and 10.0 kg/sq.cm.&#13;
8.2  In rocky terrain, gully or river crossing and connections into structures,&#13;
galvanized mild steel (GI) pipes are used.&#13;
8.3   Pipelines are laid with a well compacted earth cover of at least 90 cm. In&#13;
rocky terrain where laying at such a depth is not possible, metallic pipes (like GI&#13;
pipes) shall be used or HDPE pipes shall be properly protected to avoid damage.&#13;
9.    Optimization. Alternate design options would be considered to obtain the optimum&#13;
scheme acceptable to the community. The design criteria proposed takes this into&#13;
consideration in designing the various components of the schemes.  During designs of&#13;
schemes due attention shall be accorded to the operation and maintenance of the schemes.&#13;

13.   Rehabilitation. The possibility of rehabilitating existing sources and schemes and&#13;
incorporating them into new schemes shall be considered in both the hills and the terai if there&#13;
is a demand from the community. This could also include augmenting the supply to provide&#13;
acceptable service levels through existing systems.&#13;
14    Water quality. An environmental assessment of each of the potential sources shall be&#13;
carried out at the prefeasibility stage to identify those sources most at risk from pollution and&#13;
ensure that adequate measures, such as catchment protection and improved intake design, are&#13;
taken during and after construction. All tubewells and dugwells shall be disinfected after&#13;
construction and before commissioning. A random selection of completed schemes (initially&#13;
15%) would be tested twice - once each in the wet and dry seasons, for a limited number of&#13;
bacteriological, chemical and physical parameters to identify any trends in pollution of sources&#13;
as well as instances of pollution which require remedial action.&#13;
Catchment Protection&#13;
15. The Project would support catchment protection like plantation of trees to provide&#13;
safeguards against erosion/surface water runoff due to tree felling and pollution of sources.&#13;
Sanitation&#13;
16    Some design parameters for various types of institutional/household latrines that shall&#13;
be built through a community managed small revolving loan fund are as follows.&#13;
16. 1   Indicative technical factors for consideration in selecting the type of latrine:&#13;

NEPAL&#13;
RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Social Assessment&#13;
1.    Background.  Nepal remains one of the poorest countries in the world despite&#13;
efforts towards development in the last four decades. A burgeoning population (growth rate&#13;
of 2.5%) environmental degradation, a fragile resource base, poorly developed&#13;
infrastructure and an inefficient bureaucracy has further aggravated the situation. Current&#13;
social indicators show life expectancy at birth for men is 55 years and 53 for women,&#13;
making Nepal one of the three countries in the world where female life expectancy is less&#13;
than that of males. Infant mortality is 96 per 1000 live births and the prevalence of low&#13;
birth weight babies was 26% in 1991. The maternal mortality rate of 8.5 per 1000 is one of&#13;
the highest in the world.&#13;
2.    The literacy rate in Nepal is very low (35 percent) and is even lower for women (13&#13;
percent). The disparity in urban and rural female literacy rates are even more pronounced.&#13;
Enrolment in primary schools in 1991 was 61% for boys and 35% for girls. Economic&#13;
activity rate for men is 87.8% and that for women is only 43.5%. The female share of the&#13;
labor force is primarily concentrated in the agricultural sector.&#13;
3).    Ethnic diversity tend to follow the geophysical divisions of the country. There are&#13;
at least 25 ethnic groups each with its own distinct culture and heritage. The Tibeto-&#13;
Burman speaking peoples dominate the mountains in the north, the Nepali speaking are&#13;
concentrated in the middle hills and the Maithili and Bhopuri speaking are primarily found&#13;
in the terai. The majority of the population are Hindus (90%) followed by Buddhists (5%)&#13;
and Muslims (3%). A tradition of religious tolerance has resulted in a mixture of Buddhist&#13;
and Hindu elements in people's practices and beliefs. In the urban centers economic&#13;
necessity and modem education have minimized the utility of the caste based occupational&#13;
system. However, in the rural areas it continues to affect one's access to resources,&#13;
education and political power.&#13;
4.    Constraints. The major constraint that would be encountered in attempting to get&#13;
local people to work together to achieve project objectives is the dual problem of caste and&#13;
ethnic distinctions. The JAKPAS pilot project has demonstrated that in stratified&#13;
communities, the occupational caste groups (blacksmiths, tailors, shoemakers etc.) and/or&#13;
minority ethnic groups have not been able to participate effectively in the community action&#13;
planning (CAP) process because of attitudes which govern social interaction between&#13;
"high" and "low" castes. In addition, their lower literacy levels, lack of confidence to speak&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 160 -&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
in public meetings and/or difficulty in communicating because of language barriers have&#13;
inhibited their full participation.&#13;
5.    The attitudes of men towards increasing women's participation would have an&#13;
impact on scheme sustainability. Most men believe that women cannot contribute to&#13;
discussions as they are illiterate or are too busy with childcare and/or household chores.&#13;
Culturally defined roles and responsibilities confine women to household maintenance&#13;
tasks, and deviations from cultural norms/values are usually frowned upon by village elders.&#13;
The pilot testing project demonstrated that this was more pronounced among the terai&#13;
groups, and in communities adhering to strict Hindu value systems.&#13;
6.    Assessment of Action Plan. Experience of the pilot project indicate that most&#13;
communities would lack technical skills and experience in cooperative actions such as&#13;
planning, constructing and maintaining common facilities. The proposed scheme cycle&#13;
which spans 36 months would allow SOs to assist communities to organize at a pace&#13;
appropriate to the local beneficiary group. The community action planning process (CAP)&#13;
would increase people's choices, increase their awareness of filth borne diseases and ensure&#13;
that technical design and scheme costs correspond to user needs.  The pilot project&#13;
demonstrated that interventions for community capacity building activities such as the&#13;
CAP process and nonformal education (NFE) have contributed towards bringing social&#13;
changes, such as a willingness to encourage women to take decision making roles, and&#13;
promoted the inclusion of occupational castes and/or other minority groups in the WUC to&#13;
improve services. To ensure disadvantaged groups fully participate in project benefits the&#13;
project has included complete community coverage, a registered water user group (W[G),&#13;
and a representative water user committee (WUC) with at least two women as criteria for&#13;
scheme selection. Trainings targeted to community members would contribute towards&#13;
institutionalizing the WUG for long term scheme sustainability. In addition, the women's&#13;
technical support services (WTSS) provides additional support to women to maximize&#13;
project benefits.&#13;
7.    The pilot project also demonstrated that when felt needs are properly identified a&#13;
high degree of beneficiary participation could be expected. This was demonstrated by&#13;
community willingness to contribute substantial time and cash to improve water supplies&#13;
thus contributing to scheme sustainability.  The project would assess the level of&#13;
need/demand and the degree of beneficiary participation prior to financing rural water&#13;
supply and sanitation schemes.&#13;
8.   The JAKPAS pilot project has substantially increased the capacity of SOs and&#13;
demonstrated the existence of many SOs that would be able to fulfil scheme&#13;
responsibilities, The project includes training for SOs to enable them to undertake their&#13;
tasks effectively. The project provides for monitoring visits in the development and&#13;
implementation phase to monitor SO compliance with contractual agreements, the quality&#13;
of outputs, and to assess the effectiveness of methods used in project implementation.&#13;

RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Terms of Reference for Technical Advisor&#13;
Position:          Technical Advisor&#13;
Duration:          Two years&#13;
Duty station:      Kathmandu, Nepal. Extensive in-country travel would be required&#13;
and some out of the country travel may be required.&#13;
Position Description:&#13;
1.    A Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board (the Board) has&#13;
been recently established by His Majesty's Government of Nepal to implement a demand&#13;
led, community based project, funded by IDA, whose objectives are to: (i) deliver&#13;
sustainable health and hygiene benefits to the rural population through improvements in&#13;
the water supply and sanitation facilities, (ii) improve rural real income by assisting women&#13;
identify ways to earn income from time saved in carrying water; and (iii) strengthen&#13;
governmental and non-governmental capabilities to undertake and sustain said efforts. The&#13;
focus of the project is to empower rural communities by using a demand driven approach&#13;
to service delivery and a participatory process to decision making to implement their water&#13;
supply and sanitation schemes with the assistance of support organizations (NGOs, CBOs,&#13;
private firms etc.) recruited by the Board.&#13;
2     The Board, therefore, needs to ensure that the demand driven approach and&#13;
community led participatory process to service delivery through support organizations&#13;
(SOs) is made effective. One of the many facets of this approach is to establish linkages&#13;
and good working relations with SOs. The challenge, therefore, is to operationalize within&#13;
the Board such demand driven approach and participatory process as well as the linkages&#13;
with SOs to make this service delivery mechanism effective. The prime responsibility of&#13;
the Technical Advisor (TA) is to help the Board meet this challenge.&#13;
Responsibilities:&#13;
3.    The Technical Advisor (TA) for the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund&#13;
Development Board will have overall responsibility to:&#13;
(i)    Assist the ED in ensuring that the service delivery to the Communities follow a&#13;
demand led, community based approach, using an appropriate participatory&#13;
process thereby ensuring a high degree of scheme sustainability.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Rural Water Supply
            and Sanitation Project are to raise living standards in
            rural areas of Nepal by: (i) delivering sustainable health
            and hygiene benefits to the rural population through
            improvements in water supply and sanitation; (ii) improving
            rural real incomes by assisting women to identify ways to
            earn income from time saved in carrying water; and (iii)
            improving governmental and nongovernmental capabilities to
            undertake and sustain these efforts. The first of three
            project components is the establishment and operation of the
            Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board.
            The second is the selection and construction of rural water
            supply and sanitation schemes. The last is to conduct
            Institutional Development and Studies.
