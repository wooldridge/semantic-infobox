KINGDOM OF MOROCCO&#13;
SECONDARY, TERTIARY AND RURAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Borrower   Kingdom of Morocco.&#13;
Amount    $57.6 million.&#13;
Terms        Twenty years, including a five-year grace period, at the Bank's standard&#13;
variable interest rate.&#13;
Objectives  (a)   address core needs of the rural poor by improving access to social&#13;
services and to market;&#13;
(b)   accelerate private sector development by reducing regulatory con-&#13;
straints in road transport and by increased resort to road works and&#13;
supervision by contract;&#13;
(c)   develop road management expertise in the new regional directorates;&#13;
and&#13;
(d)   improve road safety.&#13;
Project     (a)   improving about 1,133 km of priority unpaved rural roads to all-&#13;
Descrip-           weather gravel standard, constructing 96 km of paved rural roads,&#13;
tion               and finalizing the road reclassification (21% of cost);&#13;
(b)   improving about 2,219 km of paved branch roads (formerly classified&#13;
in the secondary and tertiary networks) by carrying out maintenance&#13;
backlog resealings, structural overlays and/or widening works; (66%&#13;
of cost);&#13;
(c)   improving network management (technical support, planning and pro-&#13;
gramming, improvement phasing and training) and renewal of essen-&#13;
tial road maintenance equipment (6% of cost);&#13;
(d)   streamlining the road safety organization and supporting priority&#13;
actions (7% of cost).&#13;
Project     The main benefits will involve savings in road transport costs and improved&#13;
Benefits    access to remote rural areas, which will translate into lower consumer&#13;
prices, higher farm gate prices for agricultural produce and reduction in&#13;
rural poverty. The provision of agricultural extension services will also be&#13;
facilitated, with a secondary impact on agricultural production.&#13;
Project      The risk of under-funding road maintenance activities is key. The project&#13;
Risks       will mitigate it with the agreed monitoring of road budgets.&#13;

A. TRANSPORT AND THE ECONOMY&#13;
The Geographic and Economic Framework&#13;
1.1   The Kingdom  of Morocco occupies the north-west corner of the African&#13;
continent. Its vast territory (some 459,000 km2 without Western Sahara) is characterized&#13;
by a great diversity of landscapes, from a 3,500 km long and flat coastline bordering the&#13;
Atlantic ocean and the Mediterranean sea to the high Atlas Mountains stretching across&#13;
the country from the southwest to the northeast; and of climates, from temperate in the&#13;
north to arid in the south. The population of 25.5 million (in mid-1992) is concentrated&#13;
in the northern region and growing at a fast pace (about 2.3% annually). The rate of&#13;
urbanization has increased from around 30% in 1970 to about 50% at present. Whereas&#13;
the coastal cities of Casablanca with a population of three million, and Rabat-Sale with&#13;
one million are respectively, the economic and administrative capitals of Morocco, and&#13;
dominate the urban hierarchy, the rapid urban development has also favored emergence&#13;
of medium-sized cities like Fes (600,000) and Meknes (500,000) in the east, Marrakech&#13;
(600,000) in the south, and Tanger (350,000) in the north, contributing to a more&#13;
balanced distribution of the population between urban centers (15 cities of 100,000 and&#13;
more) and rural areas. This spread, together with the relative complementary nature of&#13;
regions in terms economic production, generate high transport needs. The main flows of&#13;
passengers and goods are heavily concentrated in the Casablanca-Rabat transport&#13;
corridor, with continuation eastward towards Fes and Meknes and northwards to Tanger.&#13;
Casablanca is the largest port where 75% of the foreign trade and 90% of the container&#13;
and roll on-roll off traffic is handled. Other major traffic generation centers are Agadir&#13;
and Marrakech. Morocco is also the largest exporter of raw phosphate and by-products&#13;
in the world, which generate heavy rail traffic from mining zones in the center and south&#13;
of the country to the ports of Casablanca, Safi, and Jorf Lasfar. Manufacturing industry,&#13;
contributing close to one-fifth of value added or as much as agriculture, has taken an&#13;
increasing share of merchandise exports in recent years (37% in 1991, against less than&#13;
10% a decade earlier). With income growth averaging some 4% per year during 1981-&#13;
1990, per capita income rose to $1,040 in 1992.&#13;
1.2   Since 1983, the Moroccan Government has been pursuing trade liberalization&#13;
measures aimed at creating incentives to import substitution and export growth, and has&#13;
been able to combine sustained growth with rigorous stabilization, low inflation, balance&#13;
of payments improvements, and good debt management. The results of Morocco's&#13;
macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform program are impressive. Major&#13;
macroeconomic imbalances that characterized the late 1970's and early 1980's have been&#13;
gradually corrected. The central Government deficit declined to 3 % of GDP, compared&#13;
to 12% in 1983 (before debt relief in both cases). On the external front, a combination&#13;
of real devaluation and trade reform to encourage manufactured export growth have&#13;
succeeded in drastically reducing the large current account deficits of the early 1980's,&#13;
notwithstanding large interest payments on foreign debt. The average current account&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                                  Chapter I&#13;
deficit over the period 1988-91 amounted to about 2% of GDP (before debt relief),&#13;
compared with almost 10% during the period 1980-1983.&#13;
1.3   Remarkably, macroeconomic adjustment has been achieved without recession and&#13;
with low inflation. Average GDP growth over 1984-90, for example, amounted to almost&#13;
5%, while inflation averaged 4% over the last three years of the period. At the same&#13;
time, external debt service ratios, which had risen to record levels in the early 1980's,&#13;
have been brought down to manageable levels following a series of debt rescheduling&#13;
agreements beginning in October 1983 (including six Paris-Club agreements and three&#13;
London-Club agreements). The debt service to exports ratio, which averaged 38% over&#13;
1980-83, had been brought down to less than 28% by 1991. Macroeconomic adjustment&#13;
has also been accompanied by economic liberalization and structural reform. There has&#13;
been significant progress in liberalizing the financial sector and external trade, as well&#13;
as improving the management, efficiency, and transparency of the public enterprise&#13;
sector. In agriculture, reforms have also progressed well.&#13;
1.4   More recently, Morocco has been enduring unfavorable exogenous influences&#13;
together with drought. Agriculture suffered from drought in 1992 and 1993, but other&#13;
aspects of macroeconomic performance and management have been more positive.&#13;
Growth in non-agricultural GDP, for example, averaged 3.8% in 1992. The budget&#13;
deficit remained around 2% of GDP in 1992 and 1993, despite the larger public&#13;
investment and relief expenditures induced by drought, an arrears clearance program, and&#13;
sluggish trade tax revenues. Money and credit growth continued to slow down following&#13;
the surge when credit controls were removed in 1991. This is reflected in moderate&#13;
inflation (close to 5% in 1992, with a continuing downward trend in late months) and&#13;
high interest rates (about 10% in real terms) which, however, have eased slightly over&#13;
the past few months. The balance of payments has not shown signs of deterioration,&#13;
despite transitory difficulties. The lower food exports and higher food import require-&#13;
ments triggered by drought, and a recent slowdown in the growth of manufactured&#13;
exports, mainly to Europe, have been compensated by favorable trends in other current&#13;
account items such as tourism receipts, and the current account deficit remained around&#13;
2% of GDP in 1993. Gains from rescheduling ended with the February 1992 Paris Club&#13;
Agreement. Nonetheless, capital inflows bolstered by disbursements from multilaterals&#13;
and sharply increasing direct foreign investment flows are keeping pace with gross&#13;
financing requirements of about $2.5 billion per year. While access to foreign exchange&#13;
has been liberalized, no apparent disequilibrium has emerged in the foreign exchange&#13;
market and the Dirham rate, pegged to a basket of currencies, has remained fairly&#13;
constant in real terms. The level of reserves slightly increased to five months of imports&#13;
(over $3.5 billion). The momentum of reforms shows no signs of abating. The&#13;
privatization program, launched in October 1982, has generated significant interest&#13;
among foreign investors and is expected to generate more than $200 million of Treasury&#13;
receipts. In the financial sector, 1993 reforms include enactment of a new Banking law&#13;
to set up a more rigorous framework for Bank regulation and supervision and other laws&#13;
to invigorate the stock exchange and capital markets, the introduction of stricter&#13;
prudential regulations, and a reduction in mandatory subscription to low-interest Treasury&#13;
bonds from 32 to 25% of banks' sight deposits. Other reforms in 1992-93 include cuts&#13;
in the corporate tax rate and rate reductions in the top bracket of personal income tax,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Te Transport Sector                                                            3&#13;
the removal of remaining restrictions on access to foreign exchange for current&#13;
transactions, capital transactions related to foreign investments and on private foreign&#13;
borrowing, a reduction in the maximum import duty, suppression of remaining import&#13;
licensing except for cereal, sugar, and edible oils (due to be removed in 1994), and&#13;
drafting of legislation to homogenize investment codes across sectors.&#13;
Medium-Term Macroeconomic Outlook&#13;
1.5   Even under relatively conservative assumptions, Morocco's medium-term&#13;
prospects look favorable. Satisfactory growth with low inflation, gradual improvement&#13;
in the country's debt indicators, and strengthening of the macroeconomic framework&#13;
should be achieved. Direct foreign investment are also expected to be forthcoming,&#13;
fueling export capability. Central Government investment will likely concentrate on social&#13;
sectors and infrastructure as a way to support private sector development. The budget and&#13;
the current account should be balanced within a few years, giving the domestic private&#13;
sector easier access to investment resources and enhancing Morocco's credit-worthiness.&#13;
Altogether, a GDP growth rate of 4.5-5% annually would seem consistent with&#13;
containing unemployment at current level despite the above 3 % expected increase of the&#13;
country's labor force. The main risks relate to drought, which causes agricultural&#13;
production to fall and inflates the food import bill, and to external shocks like a reduction&#13;
of phosphate world market prices or of tourism earnings. While current reserves are&#13;
sufficient to cover even major shocks for up to two years, recurrent or sustained&#13;
exogenous adverse effects would clearly create major difficulties. On the other hand,&#13;
domestic political risks and risks of policy slippage appear to be relatively limited.&#13;
1.6   Main challenges remain in meeting longer-term development needs, especially&#13;
those in social sectors. Despite a decline in the percentage of the population living in&#13;
absolute poverty over the last two decades, recent surveys show that a large number of&#13;
households are vulnerable and such social indicators as access to safe water, basic health&#13;
care, and primary schooling, rank low compared to countries with similar per capita&#13;
income. Regional disparities exist in the incidence of poverty and in the provision of&#13;
essential social services. Rapid and lasting improvements in social indicators call for&#13;
reallocation of public expenditures, notably in favor of rural areas, and for measures to&#13;
increase their efficiency. Good progress is being made in these directions. Private sector&#13;
development is another key priority. The private sector already accounts for close to 75 %&#13;
of manufacturing output and almost all of agricultural production. To further promote&#13;
private entrepreneurship as the engine of growth, an adequate program of structural and&#13;
incentive reforms, including reduction of corporate and personal income taxes to levels&#13;
prevalent in competing countries, needs to be complemented by provision of adequate&#13;
infrastructure, services, and financial intermediation. Decentralization and better public&#13;
sector management constitute another challenge. Social services delivery is increasingly&#13;
shifting toward local communities following the transfer by the central Government of&#13;
30% of the value added tax receipts to them. Few, however, have the financial and&#13;
managerial capabilities to handle their new functions. Further strengthening of these&#13;
capabilities is required. The same consideration applies to "core" public utilities not yet&#13;
slated for privatization. Finally, environmental and water resources have been under&#13;
growing strain in late years. Worrisome aspects of environmental degradation include&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                     Chapter I&#13;
deforestation, soil erosion, and water and air pollution as a result of industrialization.&#13;
Projected water demand and supply patterns anticipate a critical deficit within the next&#13;
two decades. Improvements in environmental and water resources management call for&#13;
a program to create a suitable institutional framework, including regulations for&#13;
environmental protection and price incentives, and undertaking priority investments. The&#13;
Moroccan authorities have already recognized the long-term development issues which&#13;
they are addressing with Bank assistance.&#13;
Description of the Transport Sector&#13;
1.7   The Moroccan land transport system is well diversified and includes some 60,000&#13;
km of roads, a railway network of about 1,900 km (of which 975 km of tracks are&#13;
electrified, and 240 km are doubled), 11 commercial ports, and 20 airports handling&#13;
scheduled flights. Road transport carries by far the largest share of total traffic,&#13;
accounting for more than 90% of intercity passenger traffic (estimated at about 22 million&#13;
passenger/kin), and 75% of freight traffic without phosphate (about 7 billion ton-km).&#13;
The railway, operated by ONCF (Office National des Chemins de Fer), has great&#13;
strategic importance as the land carrier of phosphate exports (about four billion ton-km)&#13;
and plays an increasing role for passenger transport between Marrakech and Kenitra,&#13;
most especially between Casablanca and Rabat following the introduction of vastly&#13;
improved shuttle services (its market share is estimated as 20%). Air transport plays a&#13;
major role in the country's economy, especially for tourism which is one of the main&#13;
sources of foreign exchange earnings. Three airports, Casablanca, Agadir, and&#13;
Marrakech, account for about 80 % of total passenger traffic. The recently built Mohamed&#13;
V terminal in Casablanca provides excellent services in a well decorated setting. The&#13;
national airline, Royal Air Maroc operates a fleet of 28 aircraft (including two Boeing&#13;
747) on a national and worldwide network, carrying some two million passengers&#13;
annually. The airline is profitable, partly because of high tariffs on routes to Europe&#13;
where competition is restricted.&#13;
1.8   Both road and rail traffic have increased fairly steadily over the past decade (5 %&#13;
for road and 4% for rail). Railroad capacity seems close to saturation on several links&#13;
and substantial investments have been proposed by ONCF for execution during 1994-&#13;
2000. These investments are economically justified, although some of lesser priority, like&#13;
doubling of Kenitra-Sidi Kacem, construction of the Sidi Yayia-Mechraa Bel Ksiri line,&#13;
and the electrification of the Fes-Oujda line, may have to be postponed to minimize the&#13;
drain on a very tight Government budget. Port infrastructure has expanded rapidly in&#13;
response to increased maritime transport under the export promotion policy and&#13;
modernization needs. Total port traffic did not change much during 1988-92, fluctuating&#13;
around 40 million tons, but its composition undertook significant restructuring with&#13;
containerized and roll on-roll off traffic raising their share to about 30% of general cargo&#13;
at present. A few ports are specialized: petroleum products are mostly handled in&#13;
Mohammedia and phosphate rocks in Jorf Lasfar and Safi. The largest amount of traffic&#13;
is concentrated on four major ports, with the complex of Casablanca and Mohammedia&#13;
absorbing close to 60% of total and practically all container movements. In addition,&#13;
there are nine small fishing ports. Port infrastructure is amply sufficient to handle&#13;
Moroccan sea-trade, recent studies showing an excess capacity of about 100 million tons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Transport Sector                                                       5&#13;
Constraints do however, exist for storage as a result of abnormally slow turnaround of&#13;
goods in ports. This should be remedied by institutional measures and not by creating&#13;
new storage areas. For airports, the current capacity is a adequate, and the investment&#13;
program proposed by Office National des Aeroports, the airport agency, is essentially&#13;
(more than 75%) for air traffic control, and rehabilitation of existing equipment and&#13;
runways.&#13;
B. TRANSPORT INSTITUTIONS&#13;
1.9   The Government agencies involved in the administration of the transport system&#13;
are:&#13;
(a)   the Ministry of Public Works and Training (MPW), which is responsible&#13;
for the construction and maintenance of the national, regional and&#13;
provincial road networks, and owns the port infrastructure which an&#13;
autonomous public enterprise, Office de Developpement et d'Equipement&#13;
des Ports (ODEP) operates under its supervision;&#13;
(b)   the Ministry of Transport (MOT) which is responsible for regulation,&#13;
coordination, and development of road and rail services, air transport, and&#13;
supervises several public enterprises operating in these sub-sectors, like&#13;
ONT (which has a freight forwarding monopoly on public transport), a&#13;
parastatal for luxury bus intercity transport, CNPAC (a national committee&#13;
for prevention of road accidents), ONCF (the railway company), the&#13;
Office des Aeroports of Casablanca, and Royal Air Maroc;&#13;
(c)   the Ministry of Shipping and Fisheries, which regulates shipping and&#13;
oversees the shipping parastatals;&#13;
(d)   the Ministry of Interior (MOI) which supervises the local Government,&#13;
and as such should play a role when communal road networks are created,&#13;
transferring construction and maintenance of these roads from the MPW&#13;
to the communes.&#13;
1. 10 Given the large number of agencies involved in management of the sub-sectors,&#13;
there is sometimes an overlap of responsibilities between them, and poor coordination&#13;
in investment planning. Instances have occurred where the Prime Minister was called to&#13;
arbitrate on issues of commercial nature (pricing of phosphate transport by rail for&#13;
instance). The MOT has an important role to play in that regard, and should greatly&#13;
benefit from the results of the National Transport Master Plan, to be completed soon, and&#13;
technical assistance provided under the Bank's Highway Sector Project. Vis-a-vis the&#13;
parastatals, the policy has moved toward giving them larger autonomy and, in some cases&#13;
(Luxury Bus Intercity Transport) privatization. The financial restructuring of a number&#13;
of them and the preparation of contract-plans clearly defining the respective responsibili-&#13;
ties of the Government and Management has been increasingly favored (such contract-&#13;
plans concerning Royal Air Maroc, Office de Developpement et d'Equipement des Ports,&#13;
and ONCF are being prepared or revised).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                                  ChWter I&#13;
C. PRIVATE SECTOR INVOLVEMENT IN TRANSPORT&#13;
1.11  The private sector plays an active part in provision of transport services, but its&#13;
freedom to operate and compete is sometimes constrained by regulations and dominant&#13;
positions maintained by public enterprises. Most studies and works related to road&#13;
infrastructure are carried out by private contracting and consulting industries where local&#13;
and foreign interests are often associated. Force account is limited to routine maintenance&#13;
which does not appear to be attractive to the private sector since it takes place in isolated&#13;
areas and is difficult to program thus making it impossible for a private organization to&#13;
obtain an annual volume of works sufficient to sustain the necessary investments in&#13;
equipment. Recent surveys demonstrated that track construction and rehabilitation in poor&#13;
rural areas would not take place in some cases if not by force account, which justifies&#13;
the decision to create nine mechanized brigades under the regional directorates of public&#13;
works. Motorway concession to the private sector has been envisaged, but Morocco does&#13;
not seem ready for it. Attempts to set up a private organization for toll collection on the&#13;
Rabat-Casablanca motorway failed, no one showing interest. Office National des&#13;
Transports (ONT) has a monopoly on freight forwarding and controls trucking otherwise&#13;
performed under private ownership. For railways, track renewal and maintenance is&#13;
generally executed by ONCF whereas new construction is primarily contracted out. To&#13;
a large extent, the rolling stock originates from an ONCF subsidiary together with&#13;
refitting of second-hand railway cars in its own workshops. The current organization&#13;
works well, and ONCF is among the best performing railways in the developing world.&#13;
Greater private involvement is to be sought in the service area. Sub-contracting of&#13;
railway catering may be considered. In ports, maintenance and construction managed by&#13;
Office de Developpement et d'Equipement des Ports are largely executed by private&#13;
firms. Maintenance of port equipment is also contracted out. Cargo handling by private&#13;
organizations rather than Office de Developpement et d'Equipement des Ports is a&#13;
possibility in the long run, but not advisable in the short run since Office de Developpem-&#13;
ent et d 'Equipement des Ports is an efficient organization and signed a Contract Plan with&#13;
Government which does not address the question of privatization. The Contract Plan&#13;
expires in 1996. In the maritime sub-sector, public enterprises remain dominant:&#13;
Comanav for liner services, Marphocean for chemicals and phosphate, Petrocab for&#13;
petroleum products, and Sofruma for citrus. Possibilities to privatize the latter two&#13;
companies should be examined. There are also several Moroccan private shipping lines&#13;
involved, both in citrus and passenger transport. A number of foreign shipping lines are&#13;
also present, ensuring some degree of competition. Altogether, Moroccan shipping lines&#13;
control about 20% of the total volume (33% of total value) of Moroccan freight and&#13;
about 50% of general cargo traffic. Finally, the private sector remains embryonic in air&#13;
transport infrastructure and services.&#13;

D. TRANSPORT INVESTMENTS IN RECENT YEARS&#13;
1.12   Capacity constraints started to appear in the mid-seventies as the infrastructure&#13;
inherited at independence did not keep up with the rapid economic growth that followed&#13;
it and required both rehabilitation and modernization. Investments rose swiftly from an&#13;
average of Dh 1.1 billion annually over 1973-80 to Dh 2.5 billion over 1980-87, and&#13;
close to Dh 4.5 billion over 1988-92. Table 1.1 gives details on the composition of&#13;
planned and actual investments over the last decade.&#13;

a relatively high implementation of investments programmed in the last five years (93 %).&#13;
It also outlines the changes in relative priorities given to sub-sectors. During the early&#13;
eighties, 31 % of actual transport investments went to port expansion in Jorf Lasfar and&#13;
Agadir, a third to roads, and 22% to railroads. During 1988-92, a significant effort was&#13;
made to improve roads, which absorbed 46% of total investment resources, whereas&#13;

transport sector increased&#13;
swiftly  from   10%  to&#13;
17%, the 1992 allocation&#13;
is still not sufficient in&#13;
view of the large backlog&#13;
of rehabilitation and de-&#13;
ferred periodic maintenance in the road and rail sub-sectors. In addition, the 17% is low&#13;
in comparison with other countries (for instance, Hungary, Iran, Turkey). Current&#13;
progress must be pursued.&#13;
1.15  The overall strategy under the 1988-92 plan was four-pronged:&#13;
(a)   supp ort regio nal development and the rural population;&#13;
(b)   maintain existing assets;&#13;
(c)   impr ove planning and met hods for selection of sub-proje cts; and&#13;
(d)   optimize operations.&#13;
1.16 Good progress has been made toward meeting these objectives, which will remain&#13;
appropriate for years to come. The priority actions other than maintenance and rehabilita-&#13;
tion include upgrading of the rural road network, stage construction of the motorway to&#13;
Kenitra and Larache, completion of railway line doubling between Rabat and Kenitra,&#13;
installation of container handling equipment and construction of grain silos in major&#13;
ports. For roads, the emphasis should be placed on:&#13;
(a)   rehabilitating and widening roads of local interest;&#13;
(b)   incre asing the capacity of trunk roads at risk for traffic congestion&#13;
(Rabat-Tanger, Rabat-Fes, Casablanca-EI-Jadida, and Casablanca-Settat);&#13;
and&#13;
(c)   constructing roads to isolated rural areas in order to improve access to&#13;
health care and education, and to supplies of input needed by agriculture&#13;
and market outlets for its products.&#13;
1.17 A fine balance should be struck between alleviating poverty in rural areas, very&#13;
much of Government concern in late years, and maintaining traffic fluidity in the most&#13;
active provinces, without which the other objective of facilitating private sector develop-&#13;
ment would be jeopardized. A 10,000 km rural road development program has been&#13;
adopted in response to the former requirement, respectively providing for paving and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Transport Sector                                                        9&#13;
gravelling of 3,500 km and 6,500 km of roads over a seven-year period. Dh 630 million&#13;
have been allocated in the 1995 budget to implementation of its first phase, of which Dh&#13;
460 million is raised from tax fuel increases earmarked for the Road Fund.&#13;
E. TRANSPORT SECTOR ISSUES&#13;
1.18 International competitiveness of the Moroccan economy is critically dependent on&#13;
efficient transport, which in turn requires an optimal allocation of scarce resources&#13;
among the various modes, and cost efficient supply of transport services. Four key areas&#13;
have been identified as warranting further attention by Government:&#13;
(a)   investment rationalization and planning;&#13;
(b)   public enterprise management and potential for privatization;&#13;
(c)   sector liberalization, with improved access to markets and increased&#13;
competition; and&#13;
(d)   environmental and safety aspects of transport programs.&#13;
1.19 With rising budget constraints, there is a compelling need to rationalize the&#13;
structure of the investment program and prioritize investments in support of continued&#13;
economic growth and trade development. It often calls for slowing down of new&#13;
construction to avoid investing too far ahead of demand (this is especially true of the&#13;
motorway and of the track doubling program) and concentrating on actions designed to&#13;
optimize the utilization of existing infrastructure assets. Good coordination of grouped&#13;
investments by competing and/or complementary transport modes in densely trafficked&#13;
corridors will become a key ingredient to good planning, for which increasing attention&#13;
should be given to dissemination of more refined appraisal methodologies. The planning&#13;
organization has moved toward decentralization which, together with partial transfer of&#13;
financial responsibilities, should lead to more demand driven programs; still, safeguards&#13;
should exist to maintain the national coherence of the transport system and actions should&#13;
be designed to clarify roles at every tier of the organization and provide the necessary&#13;
training.&#13;
1.20 Public enterprise reform was initiated in 1987 with the Bank's First Public&#13;
Enterprise Restructuring Loan (PERL). Support was also given through investment&#13;
lending, and the reform and financial restructuring of the public enterprises is now an&#13;
integral part of the adjustment process, the main objectives being to increase operational&#13;
efficiency, reduce public sector deficits, and provide services conducive to economic&#13;
growth. Contract-Plans have already been used to assign clear objectives and apportion&#13;
responsibilities to achieve them between the Government and public enterprises; Royal&#13;
Air Maroc successfully implemented one such Contract-Plan. ONCF, saddled with large&#13;
debts and deprived of the Government financial support that was once forthcoming,&#13;
currently was one of the public enterprise most in need of a Contract-Plan to establish&#13;
the limits to its autonomy and a more adequate cost recovery system, as well as define&#13;
Government obligations to railways (compensation of deficit making public services,&#13;
contribution to investments). Difficult negotiations spanning several years finally came&#13;
to fruition in November 1994 with signing of an agreement on a 26 % phosphate tariff&#13;
increase retroactive to January 1, 1994 and on the 1993-99 Contract-Plan. In the port&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                                 Chapter I&#13;
sub-sector, a Contract-Plan with Office de D&amp;veloppement et d'Equipement des Ports is&#13;
expected to contribute to enhanced planning and operational and financial performance.&#13;
1.21  Many transport services are still entrusted to public monopolies often lacking&#13;
resources to invest in new equipment and technology, which on top of operational&#13;
inefficiencies, result in mediocre service delivery. There is growing awareness that poor&#13;
transport performance is a drag on the national economic growth, and that fostering&#13;
private provision of transport services would have a strong impact on current constraints.&#13;
The privatization program launched under Law 39-89 does not target transport, with the&#13;
exception of CTM-LN, an interurban bus company privatized in late 1994. Issues are&#13;
complex and the Government has yet to formulate a strategy for increased private sector&#13;
participation to transport. The Bank study on Private Provision of Infrastructure&#13;
scheduled for discussion with Government in the fall of 1995 will contribute to that&#13;
objective.&#13;
1.22 Road transport issues are discussed in Chapter II, The Highway Subsector and&#13;
addressed in Chapter 111, he Project.&#13;
F. BANK EXPERIENCE IN THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
1.23 The Bank provided loans totalling $491 million equivalent to the Moroccan&#13;
Government from 1969 to 1992 for the construction, improvement, and rehabilitation of&#13;
main roads under five highway projects, of rural feeder roads under ten agricultural&#13;
projects, and for rehabilitation and modernization of port facilities under two port&#13;
projects. The highway projects were designed to encourage investments with high returns&#13;
to the economy, particularly maintenance and rehabilitation, and to help build up the&#13;
staffing and organization of the agencies responsible for road construction and&#13;
maintenance, and for transport coordination. The rural roads projects have met specific&#13;
needs as part of agricultural packages, and were designed as transport and agriculture&#13;
integrated investments. Bank involvement in financing these roads has encouraged the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform, and MPW to cooperate more closely and&#13;
consistently in determining appropriate design standards, and in making arrangements for&#13;
the maintenance of these low-volume roads.&#13;
1.24 The Project Performance Audit Report for the First, Second, third, and Fourth&#13;
Highway Projects (respectively Loan 642-MOR, Credit 167-MOR, Loan 955-MOR, and&#13;
Loan 1830-MOR), designed to improve traffic conditions, highway maintenance, and&#13;
transport planning, outline their successful implementation with rates of return above&#13;
appraisal estimates despite cost overruns. Loan covenants were generally adhered to, but&#13;
progress sought on transport planning did not fully materialize, in part because of split&#13;
responsibilities and limited cooperation between MOT and MPW. Disbursement lagged&#13;
considerably behind physical implementation of the projects because of slow processing&#13;
by the Government of payment requests. The situation improved following the&#13;
implementation of the SAL which streamlined budget procedures at the country level.&#13;
1.25 The Highway Sector Loan (Loan 3168-MOR) provided $79 million to priority&#13;
road strengthening and maintenance; it also sought efficiency improvements in road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

network management, in the transport market through deregulation of the trucking&#13;
industry and adjustment of road user charges, and in the construction industry. The&#13;
project has been successful to date for all components related to road management and&#13;
road works. It incurred delays in the execution of other components under MOT and&#13;
achieved only modest progress toward deregulation.&#13;
1.26 The First Port Project became effective in 1986 and provided a $22 million loan&#13;
to improve sector institutions and help maintain infrastructure in the ports of Casablanca&#13;
and Mohammedia. The project, now completed, served to establish a good dialogue in&#13;
the sub-sector and helped set the stage for a larger and more comprehensive FY91 Port&#13;
Sector Project. This project provides two loans, one to Ofice de Developpement et&#13;
d'Equipement des Ports and one to the Government totalling $132 million, primarily for&#13;
the modernization, adaptation, and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. In particular,&#13;
the project finances facilities for container and Ro-Ro handling in the ports of Casablanca&#13;
and Tanger, and the construction of a coal terminal in the port of Jorf Lasfar. A&#13;
Contract-Plan was also drawn up during preparation of the project that included a&#13;
revision to the infrastructure fee paid by Office de Developpement et d'Equipement des&#13;
Ports to the Government.&#13;

A. THE ROAD NETWORK&#13;
2.1   Classification. The classified Moroccan road network expanded slightly from&#13;
58,500 kms in 1988 to more than 59,500 kms in 1992. In addition, there are about&#13;
11,000 kms of tracks managed by the Ministry of Agriculture (MARA), plus an&#13;
undetermined length of tracks within irrigated agriculture areas managed by specialized&#13;
agencies under MARA. A breakdown of the network between paved and unpaved roads&#13;
is given in table 2.1.&#13;

2.2   Budget constraints and the greater priority given to maintenance caused construc-&#13;
tion of paved roads to slow down from annual increases of 350 kms on average over&#13;
1983-88 to about 280 kms over 1988-92 (-20%). Altogether, the overall construction&#13;
program in the last four years mainly consisted of road paving (85% of total), with a&#13;
large concentration on the former secondary and tertiary roads. Regional development&#13;
and improved connections to Saharan provinces were the main objectives. The stringent&#13;
national budget led to development of cofinancing agreements between DRCR and local&#13;
governments to speed up implementation of highly needed road projects. The local&#13;
governments contributed some Dh 92.5 million, or about 50% of the program cofinanced&#13;
with DRCR over the period. About 25% of the 1,320 kms of roads built between 1988&#13;
and 1992 came under such cofinancing agreements. A motorway network is being&#13;
developed, limited at present to some 70 kilometers between Rabat and Casablanca.&#13;
Construction of 136 kilometers toward Kenitra is in progress, and close to 500 kilometers&#13;
are at feasibility study stage.&#13;
2.3   The evolving patterns of administrative and economic activities have made&#13;
obsolete the 1947 classification of the road network, which comprised three categories&#13;
of roads: primary, secondary, and tertiary. It was abrogated by Decree 2-83-620 of&#13;
February 1990, which introduced a new classification in four functional categories:&#13;
motorways and national roads, linking major cities and economic centers and connecting&#13;
to neighboring countries; regional roads, linking mid-size cities within economic regions;&#13;
provincial roads, for collector roads linking villages and rural market centers to the&#13;
regional networks; and communal roads for local roads. The new classification is the first&#13;
step in the gradual transfer of ownership of the unpaved rural roads to the communes&#13;
because their position closer to the users should permit optimizing at the local level the&#13;
use of public expenditures for roads and a management more responsive to rural transport&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Highway Subsector                                                            13&#13;
demand. The reclassification process was defined in the Decree; providing for&#13;
appointment of Provincial Reclassification Committees jointly by the Ministers of the&#13;
Interior, Public Works, and Transport, to review the classification proposals regarding&#13;
the provincial and communal networks and advise the Ministers who will respectively&#13;
sign the by laws listing the roads that fall under the two categories. At this stage, only&#13;
the national and regional networks have been officially created (Arrete 78-093 dated&#13;
March 11, 1993), each comprising about 10,500 kms of roads. Flnalizing the road&#13;
reclassification is an essential project element (para 3.12).&#13;
2.4    Density. The Moroccan road network is insufficiently developed, albeit com-&#13;
mensurate to the current level of economic activities. The road density of around 8.5&#13;
km/100 km2 is less than 6% of the national average in France for instance, but, is twice&#13;
as high as in North African countries like Algeria and Egypt. However, judging by the&#13;
extent of the paved portion of its network, Morocco may compare less favorably with&#13;
others. Using such standards as the GNP per capita, population, and the country's&#13;
dimension, the 29,500 km-long paved road network is about half that of other northern&#13;
mediterranean countries. The average density of this paved network is 1.2 km/i,000&#13;
population and 4.2 km/100 km2, with a concentration in the most populated areas as&#13;
shown in table 2.2.&#13;

2.5    Lack of adequate road infrastructure may be perceived locally as a bottleneck to&#13;
full utilization of the mining, agricultural, and tourism potential in remote areas, and its&#13;
development is also sought as a way to reduce emigration of the rural poor to crowded&#13;
cities. The recent National Transport Master Plan (NTMP) concludes that a 10%&#13;
expansion of the road network would be sufficient to accommodate traffic growth of the&#13;
next 20 years, implying yearly additions of about 300 kms. Therefore, the current&#13;
construction pace is fully consistent with meeting long term development objectives.&#13;
2.6    Quality. Quality is where the Moroccan road network may have the most obvious&#13;
deficit, with scantily built unpaved rural roads and substandard narrow paved branch&#13;
roads, most of them in mediocre conditions. Unpaved roads represent half of the total&#13;
road length (against two-third in Algeria, for instance), and paved ones are generally too&#13;
narrow as shown in table 2.3.&#13;
&#13;

About two thirds of paved roads are less than 6 m-wide, whereas 7 m is generally&#13;
considered as the norm for safe crossing of two heavy vehicles. The proportion of roads&#13;
less than 4.5 m-wide, which generally implies driving on the road shoulders for crossings&#13;
where a truck is involved, represent 54% of total. The emphasis is now placed on road&#13;
widening in the sub-sector investment program. According to the NTMP, future traffic&#13;
growth would warrant adding some 4,500 kms of 7 m-wide roads within the next 20&#13;
years. As for unpaved roads, they are haphazardly built and lack drainage structure on&#13;
more than 70% of their length.&#13;
2.7    The condition of the Moroccan road network remains mediocre despite the&#13;
increasing priority given to maintenance in the 1980's. The evolution registered in this&#13;
area for paved roads since 1983 is shown in table 2.4 .&#13;
Table 2.4: Evolution of Paved Road Conditions&#13;

Over 10 years, good progress was made in all three categories of roads, raising the&#13;
average proportion of those in good condition from 20% in 1983, to 22% in 1988, and&#13;
to 41 % in 1992. But the increase observed in the proportion of roads in bad condition&#13;
from 36% in 1983 to 44% in 1992 is indicative of a steady deterioration of a large&#13;
portion of the Moroccan network, which the current maintenance and rehabilitation effort&#13;
is unable to remedy. Because budget resources are limited, the maintenance strategy has&#13;
to focus on roads with the highest traffic, thereby neglecting others also exposed to&#13;
traffic and weather related deterioration. MPW estimated that at least 1,500 kms of road&#13;
strengthening and 1,500 kns of road rehabilitation and periodic maintenance would be&#13;
required to catch up with the maintenance backlog, respectively 88 % and 15 % in excess&#13;
of what is done at present. As for unpaved roads, maintenance is not organized and&#13;
rarely done, explaining why over 80 % of their length is in bad condition. Therefore, the&#13;
fiuding of road maintenance should be monitored (ara 3.13), and the quality of both&#13;
rural roads (para 3.9) and branch roads (para 3.21) should be improved.&#13;

B. ROAD TRANSPORT DEMAND&#13;
2.8   Between 1980 and 1988, the national vehicle fleet grew at an average annual rate&#13;
of 3.9%. Improved economic conditions over the last four years induced a faster growth&#13;
at an annual rate of about 5% to reach a total of 742,000 vehicles in 1992. The&#13;
proportion of heavy vehicles (trucks and buses) remained stable around 30% of total,&#13;
despite a much faster growth of new registration in this category than for light vehicles&#13;
which suggests that the heavy vehicle fleet is now younger than it was four years ago.&#13;
2.9   About 70%  of national traffic is concentrated on 30%  of the paved network.&#13;
Table 2.5 shows traffic intensity on the primary and secondary networks (as defined in&#13;
the 1947 classification).&#13;

Primary         15 %       22 %          31 %       26 %      6 %     100 %&#13;
Secondary       10 %       23 %          48 %       19 %      0 %     100 %&#13;
The roads links to major economic centers are those most traveled, like the Casablanca-&#13;
Rabat motorway (18,000 adt), Rabat-Kenitra (12,600 adt), and Rabat-Fes (around 7,400&#13;
adt). DRCR conducts traffic counts each year on the whole paved network but with&#13;
heavier sampling rates on its most important parts. Traffic grew from 22.1 million&#13;
vehicle/kilometers per day in 1988 to 29.5 million in 1992, at an annual rate of 7.5%,&#13;
well above the 2% rate achieved over 1980-88. Continuation of this trend without&#13;
quantitative as well as qualitative adjustment of road infrastructure will lead to increased&#13;
congestion and eventually curb traffic growth. Roads carry the brunt of the national&#13;
passenger and freight traffic (respectively 90% of passenger-kms and 70% of ton-kms&#13;
in 1988), and keeping road capacity ahead of transport demand is an important condition&#13;
of sustainable economic growth. The road widening component of the project will help&#13;
expand the capacity of existing roads. The rural areas is where a deficit of transport&#13;
services is felt most acutely. Poor road conditions combined with low revenues greatly&#13;
restrains the mobility of people and exchange of their products. The Rural Transport&#13;
Study financed under Loan 3168-MOR, still in progress, has showed that motor vehicles&#13;
accounted for less than 45% of total movements. Low productivity transport using&#13;
animals certainly feeds the spiral of poverty in remote areas. The rural road component&#13;
(para 3.9) of the project is designed to alleviate these problems.&#13;
C. ROAD SAFETY&#13;
2.10 Roads and streets in Morocco are becoming increasingly unsafe, with a record&#13;
3,605 people killed in 1994. Figure 2.6: Growth of Road Accidents shows that casualties&#13;
are growing from year to year and the rate of growth itself has grown steadily over 1988-&#13;
1992, which is greatly disturbing. Annex 2.1: Road Accidents, gives statistical details on&#13;
accidents and casualties on both urban and interurban roads and compare their growth&#13;
with growth in population, vehicle fleet and traffic. Interurban roads account for one&#13;

(Figure 2.8: Deviation from Smeed's Formula). One positive point, though, is that local&#13;

D. THE ROAD TRANSPORT MARKET&#13;
2.13 Interurban bus services are operated mainly by small private companies or coop-&#13;
eratives; CTM-LN, the only parastatal which provides nationwide luxury interurban bus&#13;
services, was privatized in 1994. Market access is regulated by a National Transport&#13;
Commission. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) has a representative in each major town&#13;
whose assignment is to organize and control the operations of the local bus stations. Main&#13;
regulations include: (a) licensing of bus operators on given routes with specification of&#13;
service frequency by a Provincial Committee; (b) capping of bus fares by a Commission&#13;
reporting to the Prime Minister, based on proposals made by MOT. The market share&#13;
of interurban services has slowly declined to about 50% at present. Transport by private&#13;
vehicle maintained its share at around 30% of vehicle-kms. Taxis constitute the&#13;
expanding segment of the market, a significant and fast growing portion of which oper-&#13;
ates without license. The quality of services is generally satisfactory, but progress should&#13;
be made in enforcing higher safety standards. Renewal and upgrading of the bus fleet is&#13;
hampered by pricing regulations.&#13;
2.14  The trucking industry, entirely in private hands, falls into three categories: (a)&#13;
operators of trucks of less than eight tons gross weight, which are free to operate but not&#13;
legally authorized to do public transport; (b) operators of trucks of eight tons gross&#13;
weight and above restricting their activity to own account transport: they must be&#13;
licensed by the Road Transport Directorate at MOT after consultation with ONCF, the&#13;
railway company, and the Office National des Transports (ONT); (c) operators of trucks&#13;
of eight tons gross weight and above engaging in public transport: they are required to&#13;
do business through ONT, a public agency operating along commercial principles with&#13;
a monopoly on road freight forwarding. Supply of public transport is fragmented, the&#13;
owners rarely having more than two trucks, and truckers operating under ONT's tutelage&#13;
are generally required to join cooperatives, which are assigned transport quotas. The&#13;
separation of ownership from operations is a distinct feature of the Moroccan system; it&#13;
tends to weaken the trucking industry and is not conducive to raising professional&#13;
standards, which are low. Licenses are often granted as reward for services rendered by&#13;
an individual or his family to the Kingdom, and they are rented by truckers at a cost&#13;
which, in recent years, decreased as a result of less restrictive licensing by MOT. ONT&#13;
collects freight payments on behalf of its affiliates against their paying a fee for the&#13;
service. The current trucking organization was established by Dahir 1.63.260 of&#13;
November 12, 1963.&#13;
2.15 The trucking market is highly distorted. About 40% of all goods are transported&#13;
by trucks of less than eight tons gross weight which have become quite active on the&#13;
public transport market in violation of the law. This a complex phenomenon both&#13;
reflecting a deficit of trucking services in certain areas, the rural ones especially, and&#13;
evasion tactics by truckers and shippers anxious to free themselves from the cumbersome&#13;
ONT system. These illegal operations have been tolerated silently by the MOT which left&#13;
them exposed to individual sanctions and abuses, and created incentives to go for quick&#13;
gains by overloading trucks at the expense of road safety. Pending issuance of new&#13;
legislation and as an interim measure, the Minister of Transport instructed law&#13;
enforcement units to waive provisions of Dahir 1.63.260 barring 8-ton trucks from doing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                                  Chapter 11&#13;
public transport (Directive 16/DTT/DPCS/SR of May 25, 1994). For its part, ONT is&#13;
estimated to control no more than a third of road freight transport, and its share of the&#13;
international trucking market is at a low 10% reflecting the Moroccan truckers inability&#13;
to compete for quality transport with foreign truckers. About 70% of goods directly&#13;
carried by ONT's affiliates relate to the public sector, another clue that private sector&#13;
shippers tend to contract outside ONT. The ongoing privatization program will further&#13;
erode the ONT market base. Finally, own account transport represents about 35% of&#13;
freight moved by roads, which is high.&#13;
2.16 ONT has been credited in the past with a positive contribution to market&#13;
efficiency by allowing private truckers with limited means and organization to minimize&#13;
overhead costs and empty back-haul costs (the overall load factor for most interurban&#13;
movements is a satisfactory 60%). No subsidies have been called from Government. But&#13;
the negative sides of the ONT system have been increasingly visible with the evolution&#13;
in complexity of the national and international markets and increasing needs for high&#13;
standard of services. ONT is a bureaucratic organization of some 1,200 staff which&#13;
shows some of the negative characteristics of the civil service, including low responsive-&#13;
ness to commercial needs of shippers. It also acts as a marketing agency, charging a&#13;
reference tariff approved by MOT with preferential rates that, truckers complain, are too&#13;
low to allow for normal renewal of their aging truck fleet. The relatively high fee&#13;
charged by ONT for its services (4-5% of freight rates on average, plus 1% to&#13;
compensate truckers for empty back-hauls) is another bone of contention. In practice,&#13;
truckers bypass ONT as much as possible, making direct transport arrangements with&#13;
regular customers, and go to ONT's offices only to regularize the paperwork and pay the&#13;
fee. ONT's monopoly also seems to place restrictions on development of intermodal (rail&#13;
and road) services, as ONCF for instance is barred from purchasing trucks. There is&#13;
growing awareness that better and cheaper transport, so essential to economic growth and&#13;
international competitiveness, can only be achieved by eliminating the ONT monopoly&#13;
on freight forwarding and establishing market-based trucking prices, which again implies&#13;
changing Law 1.63.260. Inproving road transport efficiency is an important project&#13;
objective and liberalizing road transport is a project element (paras 3.51 - 3.54).&#13;
2.17 There are 58 technical inspection centers in Morocco, but their performances are&#13;
mediocre and technical standards are loosely enforced. To address this issue, a national&#13;
center for control of vehicles has been created under MOT and the Highway Sector&#13;
Project provides financing to build needed facilities and equip them. The national center&#13;
will control the 58 vehicle inspection centers. The building and the equipment are&#13;
operational but the current lack of budget appropriations does not allow recruiting staff&#13;
and delays launching of the Bank financed technical assistance program.&#13;

E. ADMINISTRATION&#13;
2.18 The Road and Traffic Department (DRCR) of the MPW is responsible for the&#13;
design, construction, and maintenance of the National, Regional, and Provincial networks&#13;
(Document in project file: DRCR's Organization). The headquarters only deals with&#13;
matters of general planning, coordination, and supervision. The peripheral offices are&#13;
largely autonomous for programming of road works, contract awards and management,&#13;
and supervision of works. The field organization consists of 40 provincial offices and 80&#13;
subdivisions. Since 1983, seven regional offices have existed as an intermediary layer&#13;
between central directorates (DRCR and the other directorates under MPW) and&#13;
provincial offices, to provide support in the execution of their mission, exclusive of&#13;
activities related to day-to-day operations. The 1992 Constitution granted regions a legal&#13;
status and the tendency is to use this administrative level to re-equilibrate the distribution&#13;
of responsibilities between central and decentralized organizations, which were given too&#13;
much autonomy at the expense of national coherence in road network development.&#13;
2.19 MPW created three pilot regional directorates on September 1, 1992: Center-&#13;
North (Fes), Center-South (Meknes), and Tensift (Marrakech). The Regional Director&#13;
exerts no line authority over Provincial Directors, except when he receives specific&#13;
delegation from the Minister. The thrust of the experiment is to concentrate managerial&#13;
competence (particularly for planning and economic studies) at the regional level. Current&#13;
missions of the Regional Director are: (a) commissioning of studies of common interest&#13;
to enhance cost effectiveness of road works; (b) supervision of technical studies by&#13;
central directorates, to improve project programming and project implementation&#13;
(physical and financial); (c) verification of quality of executed works and of road&#13;
management data collected within an annual program agreed by central directorates; (d)&#13;
technical assistance to provinces that request it, and training; (e) coordination of&#13;
preparation of the multi-year action program and dissemination of improved appraisal&#13;
techniques; monitoring of budget execution by provinces; (f) operation and maintenance&#13;
of the regional equipment fleet. The Regional Director may be authorized to set up force&#13;
account units if DRCR is satisfied with current performance of the equipment fleet. The&#13;
Regional Director is further entrusted with development of the regional economic data&#13;
base. Pilot regional directorates are just starting to get organized to handle their enlarged&#13;
missions. Their future role and possible spreading of the experiment to the other four&#13;
regions critically hinges on a rapid build-up of expertise and skills. Because the Regional&#13;
Directors have an essential role to play in optimizing public expenditures for roads,&#13;
fostering their development will be an important means of improving network manage-&#13;
ment under the project (paras 3.30 - 3.33).&#13;
2.20 The parastatal Autoroutes du Maroc is entrusted with management and operations&#13;
of the Casablanca-Larache motorway. Tolls are currently collected on the Casablanca-&#13;
Rabat section; they are intended to cover the costs borne by Autoroutes du Maroc and&#13;
contribute to financing of the construction of the Rabat-Larache section, which started&#13;
in 1992. Between Dh 300 and 400 million are collected annually.&#13;
2.21 The communal networks, once established, will be under the responsibility of the&#13;
communes, supervised by the Ministry of the Interior. With the exception of large towns,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20                                                                 Chapter II&#13;
which have their own technical road service, the communes cannot afford to handle&#13;
directly their new road responsibilities. The current strategy is to develop a system of&#13;
conventions by which a commune would entrust the local public works subdivision with&#13;
responsibilities to manage and execute road maintenance on its behalf.&#13;
2.22 The National Center for Road Study and Research (CNER) was created in 1979,&#13;
then established as a financially autonomous agency under MPW in 1986. CNER is&#13;
structured in four divisions: (a) research and dissemination of technical know how; (b)&#13;
monitoring of the Moroccan road network; (c) development and processing of a road data&#13;
base; (c) administration and finance. CNER employs about 50 staff, half of which are&#13;
road engineers and technicians. It still derives most of its revenues from contracts&#13;
awarded by DRCR, but has a branch dealing with military airports and recently&#13;
developed its consulting activities outside Morocco. A road maintenance strategy for&#13;
1992-2012 has been developed by CNER, using SYGER (road management system),&#13;
which is an application of the HDM III model; it computes the discounted total road and&#13;
vehicle costs under each variant of maintenance, and optimizes the use of scarce&#13;
maintenance budgets. Road roughness measurements and other tasks needed to develop&#13;
and update the paved road data base is entrusted to CNER with support given by&#13;
DRCR's technical divisions. Actions currently planned focus on two aspects: (a)&#13;
strengthening of the road data base, through auditing of collection and measurement&#13;
methods; (b) more accurate perception of maintenance priorities, by making HDM III&#13;
available to regions after proper calibration. CNER will play an important role in the&#13;
institution building envisaged at regional level.&#13;
F. PLANNING, BUDGETING, FINANCING&#13;
Planning&#13;
2.23  Preparation of a formal plan covering 1993-97 has been abandoned, as the 1992&#13;
Constitution stops making reference to the concept of plan. The current approach favors&#13;
flexibility and more active involvement of regions in the programming of road works.&#13;
The initiative to prepare plans rests with DRCR, which resorts to a system of 5-year&#13;
rolling action programs. Yearly budgets are directly derived from such programs. The&#13;
Planning Directorate at MPW has nominal responsibility to monitor planning DRCR&#13;
activities, but has very little influence in practice for lack of proper analytical tools and&#13;
information. The Planning Directorate concentrates its current efforts on improving&#13;
systems to monitor financial and physical implementation of road investment budgets.&#13;
2.24 A decision has been made to transfer planning responsibilities to the regions in&#13;
order to avoid past pitfalls when, first, excessive decentralization gave too much&#13;
influence in decision making to local politicians. Then, excessive centralization fed into&#13;
a normative approach to road work programming which produced some poor choices and&#13;
implementation problems when locals would lack motivation to execute works that they&#13;
did not see as needed as assessed by central programming institutions. At present, DRCR&#13;
allocates a tentative budget to each province on the basis of four criteria: (a) length of&#13;
paved roads in bad and very bad condition; (b) traffic on paved roads; (c) total length of&#13;
roads; (d) length of mountain roads. Weights are given to each criteria. For unpaved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Highway Subsector                                                     21&#13;
roads, quotas are estimated on the basis of other objective criteria like the proportion of&#13;
the rural population and of rural roads in the respective province. Coordination of the&#13;
programming work done by the local DPTP is vested in a Committee (Comite Technique&#13;
de Decentralisation). Guidelines are given on how priorities should be established.&#13;
Minimum economic returns on the investments (12%) and service standards are among&#13;
the main applied norms. Greater emphasis is also placed on the state of preparation of&#13;
technical studies, and a 2-year maturation period applies from programming to execution&#13;
date. The still ongoing road reclassification further facilitates the identification of&#13;
priorities.&#13;
2.25 Recently, simplified pavement management system (EVAL) has been used to&#13;
compute the economic rates of return of proposed road investments. The linear&#13;
assumptions behind many cost functions tend to exaggerate the benefits of reduced&#13;
roughness for extreme values, and more significant and comparable results will be&#13;
possible by using HDM III. This model may be too complex however to be used by the&#13;
DPTPs, hence the strategy under the proposed project is to build expertise in its&#13;
utilization at the regional level where the equipment and training effort will be&#13;
concentrated (paras 3.30 - 3.33). Consideration should further be given to streamlining&#13;
of appraisal techniques to ensure compatibility of construction, modernization, and&#13;
maintenance investments. The current practice is to allocate resources to each sub-&#13;
program on the basis of perceived priorities; a more objective allocation of budget&#13;
resources would likely raise the overall economic efficiency of the road investment&#13;
budget.&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
2.26 The global road budget is negotiated each year by MPW with the Ministry of&#13;
Finance. By late January each year, the road budget is allocated to the DPTPs by DRCR&#13;
after clearance by the Minister and the Central Controller in the Ministry of Finance. The&#13;
local DPTP has direct authority from the Minister to commit and spend within its&#13;
allocated budget and represents MPW in the provinces; he remains overseen by DRCR&#13;
in personnel management matters. Significant improvement in actual implementation of&#13;
road budgets was achieved in the late eighties as a result of legislation that authorizes the&#13;
start of procurement in the year preceding the actual budget appropriations. Procurement&#13;
is a lengthy process, and this practice mobilizes contractors quickly after the budget is&#13;
allocated. The actual road spending ratio of 60% of approved budgets over 1981-85 has&#13;
gone up to about 80%, which is about satisfactory.&#13;
2.27 Despite overall budget stringencies and commitments under SAL II which reduced&#13;
the importance of infrastructure spending from 3% of total expenditures in the early&#13;
eighties to 2% at present, road expenditures increased from Dh 1.02 billion in 1989 to&#13;
Dh 1.46 billion in 1993 (+44% in current dirham; + 12.5% in constant dirham). Table&#13;
2.9 gives their breakdown and evolution of actual road expenditures over 1989-93.&#13;

2.28   Government spending in the road sub-sector mainly increased in relation to&#13;
maintenance (rehabilitation, strengthening, and periodic and routine maintenance) which,&#13;
given that about 90% of the equipment was assigned to maintenance tasks, rose from&#13;
73% of total road expenses in 1989 to about 84% in 1993. This evolution seems&#13;
consistent with enhanced economic efficiency of road programs, as rates of return on&#13;
money spent to reduce a maintenance backlog are generally much higher than those on&#13;
investments in road construction. Amounts budgeted for new construction in 1994 were&#13;
down to Dh 196 million, two-third of which for rural roads, out of a total road budget&#13;
of Dh 1.5 billion in which maintenance accounted for close to 87%. The 1995 budget&#13;
was increased to just under Dh 2 billion (+33% in current dirham) with incremental&#13;
resources allocated in full to implementation of the 10,000 km rural road development&#13;
program; the budget structure otherwise remained unchanged from previous year. In a&#13;
context of tighter public finance where most budgets other than those directed to social&#13;
sector needs had to be cut by 3-5 %, the rather favorable treatment received by the road&#13;
budget reflects the continued Government commitment to better road maintenance, and&#13;
there is little room for further shifts in favor of maintenance since they would come at&#13;
the expense of the high priority rural road program. Therefore, the objective under the&#13;
project should be to maintain the same level of maintenance assuming no real increase&#13;
in the total road budget. Opportunities to bring maintenance budgets closer to what they&#13;
should ideally be (the gap is currently estimated at about 70%) are entirely contingent&#13;
upon relaxation of the overall Government budget constraint on which one can only&#13;
speculate at this stage.&#13;
2.29 Under the Highway Sector Project (Loan 3168-MOR) the practice of carrying out&#13;
annual reviews with the Bank of the road investment programs was established.&#13;
Agreement has been reached at negotiations to continue the practice. The Government&#13;
will submit to the Bank's representatives the proposed road investment program for the&#13;
following year, together with the technical and economic justification of its elements.&#13;
Thereafter, the Government will finalize the program, taking the Bank's comments into&#13;
consideration and ensuring the prompt implementation of the program. The program will&#13;
include in particular road rehabilitation and overlay, construction of facilities and&#13;
provision of equipment and indicate the financing considered.&#13;
&#13;

2.30 The DPTP maintains administrative accounts, commitments and payments and&#13;
monthly statements are sent to DRCR. Under standard payment procedures, the DPTP&#13;
sends instructions to the local General Treasurer with copy to DRCR, to pay contractors&#13;
or suppliers within approved contracts. When foreign financing is involved, the DPTP&#13;
will issue a two-part payment order, with one relating to loan financing and the other to&#13;
counterpart funding. The General Treasurer will not proceed with the latter's payment&#13;
unless he gets notification by the Minister of Finance that the particular contract is&#13;
eligible under that loan, irrespective of the contract amount. For instance, this&#13;
notification is given once the Bank has sent its no objection telex. This procedure is&#13;
rather cumbersome and there are instances when the General Treasurer is notified of loan&#13;
eligibility only after months of delay. After the payment is made, the local General&#13;
Treasurer sends the accounting documentation to the central General Treasurer who then&#13;
debits the Bank special account and sends a monthly statement of all debits to the Budget&#13;
Directorate based on which applications for replenishment of the special account are&#13;
prepared. Disbursement of Loan 3168-MOR has sometimes been hampered by the&#13;
replenishment speed of the Treasury circuit, which is slower than the commitment and&#13;
payment speed. Procedures should be streamlined to ensure (a) prompt notification of&#13;
loan eligibility to the local General Treasurers within the SOEs limits; and (b) a smoother&#13;
flow of payment requests requiring better contract management and coordination between&#13;
MPW and the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
Financing&#13;
2.31  Local financing of road expenditures comes essentially from the Government&#13;
budget and the Road Fund, which is discussed in the following section. Budgetary con-&#13;
straints have been rising in recent years and the Ministry of Finance is very reluctant to&#13;
earmark tax revenue and additional transfers from central to local governments beyond&#13;
what it has already conceded, namely the initial endowment of the Road Fund, and the&#13;
transfer of 30% of the value added tax (VAT) to local governments. The tax base is&#13;
heavily tapped and the potential resources that it could yield seem predesignated by the&#13;
Ministry of Finance for general uses. The possibility of increasing road funding, as&#13;
desired, hinges on finding ways to raise more user charges. A study is being financed&#13;
under the Highway Sector Project to seek, among other things, feasible methods for&#13;
steadier funding of road maintenance. Donor financing of the Moroccan road budget was&#13;
on average 46% of total over 1988-92. The African Development Bank (AfDB) and the&#13;
World Bank used to be the sole contributors. AfDB approved a $92 million loan under&#13;
its Third Road Maintenance Project dealing with the primary and the secondary&#13;
networks. Japan provided grant financing for construction of an institute specialized in&#13;
road maintenance and road equipment training, and for technical assistance to train train-&#13;
ers. Japan is cofinancing the present project.&#13;
2.32 Funding of communal road maintenance outside town limits was sourced in the&#13;
central budget before 1990. Amounts spent by DRCR on communal roads stayed below&#13;
Dh 50 million in recent years, 90% of which were for maintenance of paved roads.&#13;
There was no regular maintenance for unpaved roads, most interventions being in&#13;
response to emergencies caused by bad weather making roads impassable. The 1990&#13;
Decree on road classification creates a communal network to be managed and financed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                                                                        Chapter II&#13;
by communes (art. 2) and, when local resources are not sufficient, its article five makes&#13;
it eligible for maintenance subsidies from the Government current budget based on&#13;
recommendations by the Ministry of Interior (MOI). The financial implications of the&#13;
new system raised great concern in the communes, seeing that they might have to bear&#13;
additional costs while getting no new resources, and contributed to delay initiation of the&#13;
formal communal network  classification  process by  almost three  years. Pending&#13;
completion of this process, the old funding system remains in place.&#13;

Finance Project approved in June 1993, faces a narrow resource base and enlarged costs&#13;
following the creation of 500 new communes recently and recruitment of about 40,000&#13;
people. Table 2.10: Evolution of Communal Budgets, gives an overview of the evolution&#13;
of communal budgets between 1988 and 1992. Local revenues were boosted by&#13;
implementation in 1988 of a 1985 Law allocating 30% of the value added tax (VAT) to&#13;
them. Local taxes accruing to communal budgets rose from Dh 2.2 billion in 1989 to Dh&#13;
3.4 billion in 1992. The VAT transfers of Dh 2.1 billion in 1992 are comprised of two&#13;
elements: an operating subsidy roughly estimated at Dh 0.7 billion, and subsidies&#13;
earmarked for investment expenditures. The current revenue of communes was then&#13;
around Dh 4 billion in 1992 against current expenditures of Dh 3.7 billion; the gross cash&#13;
flow roughly matched more the debt service requirements. Table 2.10 also shows that&#13;
some Dh 110 million was spent on infrastructure maintenance in 1992, or about half the&#13;
average allocation of 1989 and 1991, and only 20% of the 1990 allocation. Most of these&#13;
resources go to the urban networks. The same applies to capital expenditures, although&#13;
funing of intercity roads by communes is on the rise through cofinancing arrangements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Highway Subsector                                                    25&#13;
with the Government, currently estimated at a third of their infrastructure capital budget.&#13;
The evolution of borrowing shows a peak in 1990 which suggests that the larger&#13;
maintenance requirements faced that year by communes had to be financed indirectly by&#13;
borrowing, which is abnormal and indicative of severe cash shortages. The item other&#13;
revenues broadly corresponds to surpluses from previous years available for investment&#13;
expenditures only.&#13;
2.34  The 1,200 rural communes collected only 31% of total local communal taxes in&#13;
1992 which, together with the operating subsidy portion of the VAT, gave them current&#13;
revenues of almost Dh 1.5 billion against current expenditures of Dh 855 million. The&#13;
surplus of about Dh 500 million (after debt servicing) meant, however, that each rural&#13;
commune had Dh 0.4 million on average to finance the minimum investments needed by&#13;
their population. The financial condition of rural communes did gain strength (table 2.10&#13;
shows local tax revenue increasing by 86% between 1989 and 1992) but does not allow&#13;
them to fully meet their obligations and remains too weak to sustain large borrowing.&#13;
This average picture still gives an imperfect rendition of real situations which differ&#13;
greatly among communes. A few enjoy relative financial easiness linked, for instance,&#13;
to forestry resources, while most derive more than 90% of their revenue from VAT&#13;
transfers.&#13;
2.35  According to table 2.10, rural communes spent less than Dh 20 million per year&#13;
on road infrastructure from 1989 to 1992 (this average excludes 1990 which appears to&#13;
be an exception), which amounts to Dh 15-20 thousand per commune and per year.&#13;
These meager resources mostly went to street networks. Consultants estimate the annual&#13;
cost of routine and of periodic maintenance for unpaved roads around Dh 1,800 and Dh&#13;
2,700 per km respectively (the latter reflects local conditions whereby only a third of the&#13;
road length is treated). For paved roads, corresponding costs are Dh 9,800 and Dh&#13;
7,000. With an average of 10 km of unpaved roads and 3,5 km of paved ones in each&#13;
rural commune, fully funded road maintenance implies spending an additional Dh&#13;
104,000 per year and commune, more than five times the actual spending in recent years.&#13;
This is not achievable under current and foreseeable conditions, and financial support will&#13;
have to come from outside, preferably through the road fund. Development and&#13;
modernization of their road network is another constraint that rural communes face.&#13;
Much higher costs per km are involved, not commensurate to the above estimate of&#13;
resources available for investment. That leaves most rural communes with no other&#13;
alternative than seeking Government subsidies to cover a substantial part of investments&#13;
programmed under the 10,000 km rural road development program partly financed under&#13;
the project.&#13;
2.36 Funding of the 10,000 km rural road development program relies on the&#13;
assumption that an average of 12.5% of its cost will be financed by the communes.&#13;
Should communes be unable to bring the needed cofinancing, the Government would&#13;
bridge the gap with its own resources but may defer implementation of that particular&#13;
sub-project to the program's late years. The communes would be required to maintain&#13;
the road after its paving or gravelling if it fell within the communal network. To ensure&#13;
a cost effective use of resources allocated to communal roads maintenance, the recipient&#13;
communes will sign a contract with DRCR by which the latter would have delegated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26                                                                  Chapter II&#13;
responsibility to program, design, and supervise road works. For investments, the DRCR&#13;
experience of cofinancing projects with communes has lead to strengthening conditions&#13;
of eligibility to loan funds, from verification that proposed investments are technically&#13;
feasible and economically justified and assurances that road maintenance will be properly&#13;
programmed and executed.&#13;
G. THE ROAD FUND&#13;
2.37 The Special Fund for Road Maintenance (Compte d'Affectation Speciale 35-56),&#13;
or Road Fund (RF) was created in December 1988 to remedy the severe underfunding&#13;
of road maintenance that prevailed in the early eighties and, more specifically to provide&#13;
stable funding for core operations. The Minister of Public Works has authority to commit&#13;
funds within budget limits approved by the Parliament under conditions similar to those&#13;
applicable to the general budget. Basically, the RF is just a special account which&#13;
complement the general budget resources allocated to DRCR under chapter 2,107, item&#13;
31, and one of two sources adding up to the make the DRCR budget. The RF, which has&#13;
a 12-item structure, was meant to cover all needs for routine maintenance (including&#13;
reopening of roads after snow falls and floods) and about 65 % of periodic resealing&#13;
operations, but its actual applications covered a broader spectrum including road&#13;
strengthening and rehabilitation, feasibility studies of maintenance projects, printing&#13;
expenses of car registration stickers, and rebuilding of bridges and road structures.&#13;
Resources generated by the RF increased from Dh 434 million in 1989 to around Dh 604&#13;
million in 1994. In 1995, additional tax revenue equivalent to Dh 460 million was&#13;
earmarked to the RF to finance the 10,000 km rural road development program. It&#13;
changes the definition of the RF now to finance new construction. Still, the Loi de&#13;
Finances 1995 stipulates that no less of 55% of its resources should be used for&#13;
maintenance. Just coincidentally, the RF also represents about 55 % of the 1995 total road&#13;
budget.&#13;
2.38 Resources in 1994 came from three earmarked taxes on: (a) fuel consumption (Dh&#13;
18 and 10 per liter respectively for gasoline and diesel oil); (b) vehicle registration (a&#13;
surcharge of Dh 150 per HP for passenger cars and Dh 30 per ton of gross weight for&#13;
trucks); (c) the gross weight of vehicles (rates range from Dh 650 under 5 tons to Dh&#13;
10,700 above 33 tons), a simplification of the more focussed but less manageable axle-&#13;
load charging basis. The additional resources created in 1995 came solely from doubling&#13;
of the earmarked fuel tax. Table 2.11 shows the evolution and structure of RF actual&#13;
revenues from 1989 to 1994, and the budgeted revenues for 1995.&#13;

2.39 Actual revenues to date have always been above forecast. For instance, the 1994&#13;
budget assumed revenues of Dh 530 million, compared to actual revenues of Dh 604&#13;
million. Excess revenues are carried over to the following year RF budget. In 1995, the&#13;
budget forecast has been based on a more realistic estimate of likely tax revenues,&#13;
namely Dh 630 million for "normal" revenues, and Dh 460 million for the surcharge for&#13;
rural road construction. In 1995, the RF will still have the 1994 carry-over revenue of&#13;
Dh 74 million to bring total resources available for spending to Dh 1,164 million. In&#13;
1996, the carry-over effect should be small, and the RF total revenue will normally be&#13;
around Dh 1,150 million, barring drastic changes in the traffic level. An interesting&#13;
feature of the RF is, besides the relaxation of the budget annuality rule, that its revenues&#13;
are indexed on traffic which have been growing consistently, thereby ensuring increased&#13;
funding for maintenance. Under tight budget conditions likely to extend to the medium&#13;
term, the Dh 880 million general budget allocation to DRCR is not expected to increase,&#13;
and safeguarding the integrity of the maintenance tasks will hinge on the increased&#13;
funding that the RF "mechanics" will generate.&#13;
2.40 Established to insulate road maintenance from the general revenue budgeting&#13;
process and meet essential expenditure requirements, the RF has made an increasing and&#13;
valuable contribution to the road budget as shown in table 2.12.&#13;

2.41  The amounts shown for RF financing differ from revenues because of lags&#13;
between cash collection and spending authorization, and between commitments and&#13;
payments. Overall, the RF financed about 46% of total road maintenance over 1989-94,&#13;
including close to 85% of routine maintenance and about 30% of other mainte-&#13;
nance/modernization expenditures. The RF share of total stayed in a relatively narrow&#13;
range, with a low of 41.7% in 1991 and around 47% in most recent years. These&#13;
fluctuations show that the RF does have a stabilizing, albeit moderate effect on the road&#13;
maintenance budget. Regular funding of road works is indeed a desirable quality that the&#13;
RF helps enhance. The main driving force behind this evolution has been the strong&#13;
commitment by Government to better road maintenance to which it allocated an annual&#13;
average of about Dh 1 billion over the period under review, compared to Dh 350 million&#13;
between 1981 and 1987. In real terms, the 1994 budget is 40% higher than in 1989.&#13;
2.42 Funding of road maintenance will be constrained over the next 5 years. The 1995&#13;
maintenance budget of around Dh 1,276 million (Dh 572 million from the general&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                                 Chapter 11&#13;
budget, and Dh 704 million from the RF) is practically unchanged from previous years&#13;
in real terms, since no more funding of unpaved roads maintenance from the general&#13;
budget is needed given the considerable effort consented in favor of these roads under&#13;
the 10,000 km rural roads program. Previous concerns about the state of neglect in which&#13;
the unpaved roads were kept have been addressed in 1995 in a most comprehensive way.&#13;
The effort should now concentrate on preventing erosion of the maintenance budget for&#13;
non-rural roads, an objective sought through the proposed project conditionality.&#13;
Increasing RF resources to fully cover recurrent maintenance, and eliminating at the&#13;
same time the general budget allocations to maintenance will ensure that funding will&#13;
increase in line at least with road traffic. The maintenance strategy should be to make&#13;
progress as permitted by improvement of general budget condition toward the optimal&#13;
program, which would require annual strengthening of 1,500 km and resurfacing of an&#13;
equivalent length at a total cost of Dh 2.15 billion (70% above current level). There is&#13;
no easy way to raise additional user fees. The Bank financed study on redefinition of the&#13;
RF' confirmed the conclusions of the 1988 study: road users are generally overtaxed, and&#13;
the fact that user fees paid by heavy trucks and semi-trailers trucks do not cover a fair&#13;
share of road costs (cost coverage of 0.8 and 0.6 respectively) does not imply that they&#13;
could bear higher user fees since they already carry a heavy burden from general taxation&#13;
(the ratio of general taxes to user charges is of 3). Customs and import duties ranging&#13;
from 40 to 50% of vehicle prices hamper timely vehicle fleet renewal and development&#13;
of road transport, as evidenced by the low market share of Moroccan truckers on&#13;
international transport. Reducing these ownership-based taxes would seem desirable and&#13;
create opportunities to increase user fees. The Government budget constraint, however,&#13;
would hardly allow it to simultaneously reduce overall taxation on truckers and raise their&#13;
user charges accruing to the RF to finance more maintenance, because it would inevitably&#13;
mean less revenue in coverage of general Government functions. This assessment in&#13;
favor of the status-quo will be reexamined at mid-term review with a view to determine&#13;
if improved conditions would warrant action on pending road taxation issues.&#13;

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO&#13;
SECONDARY, TERTIARY AND RURAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
M.0 TH PROJECT&#13;
A. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The project was originally identified in 1991 as a rural roads project. In 1992,&#13;
however, the Government requested that its scope be extended to the other priority areas&#13;
in the subsector, road safety and the secondary and tertiary road network, to continue to&#13;
benefit from the Bank's dialogue in these key areas.&#13;
3.2   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank played has a unique role in&#13;
fostering sound institutional developments in road maintenance, road funding and network&#13;
management. It is important that the Bank continue to be involved in the next phase of&#13;
these reforms. Furthermore, the Bank's development strategy in Morocco focuses on&#13;
private sector development, social sectors, poverty alleviation, conservation of water&#13;
resources, protection of the environment, and public sector finance and management. The&#13;
proposed project contributes in many ways to implementation of this strategy.&#13;
3.3   Objectives. The project objectives are to:&#13;
(a)   address core needs of the rural poor by improving access to social&#13;
services and to market;&#13;
(b)   accelerate private sector development by reducing regulatory constraints&#13;
in road transport and by increased resort to road works and supervision&#13;
by contract;&#13;
(c)   develop road management expertise in the new regional directorates; and&#13;
(d)   improve road safety.&#13;
3.4  In addition, by constructing all-weather access to remote mountainous areas, the&#13;
project will prepare the ground for further social and economic development of these&#13;
areas. It will also work toward efficient decentralization of road management and should&#13;
eventually lead to better prioritization of road works and a more cost effective use of&#13;
public resources allocated to highways.&#13;
B. DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.5   Description. The proposed project includes:&#13;
(a)   improving about 1,133 kmn of priority unpaved rural roads to all-weather&#13;
gravel standard, constructing 96 km of paved rural roads, and finalizing&#13;
the road reclassification;&#13;
(b)   improving about 2,219 km of paved branch roads (formerly classified in&#13;
the secondary and tertiary networks) by carrying out maintenance backlog&#13;
resealings, structural overlays and/or widening works;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30                                                                  Chapter Iff&#13;
(c)   improving network management (technical support, planning and program-&#13;
ming, improvement phasing and training) and renewal of essential road&#13;
maintenance equipment; and&#13;
(d)   streamlining the road safety organization and supporting priority actions.&#13;
C. RURAL ROADS&#13;
Concept and Content&#13;
3.6   Policy. The Government intends to finalize the reclassification of the highway&#13;
network and prepare the future transfer of ownership of the farm-to-market roads to local&#13;
governments because their closer position to the users should permit network manage-&#13;
ment that is more responsive to rural road transport demand. To encourage the use of&#13;
appropriate standards, the Government intends to bear some of the financial burden for&#13;
both investment and maintenance. In 1995, the Government adopted a national program&#13;
of construction of 10,000 km of rural roads over a seven-year period.&#13;
3.7   Preparation. Several studies carried out under the Highway Sector Project have&#13;
contributed to the preparation of this element, in particular, the study of unpaved rural&#13;
roads improvement and maintenance, the rural transport study and the supplementary&#13;
road user charges study. These studies have reviewed about 38,140 km of unpaved rural&#13;
roads (both classified and unclassified). Only 20% of the reviewed roads have adequate&#13;
formation and drainage while 30% are unusable at least 30 days a year. The volume is&#13;
10 vehicles of average daily traffic (adt) or less on 70% of this network. No maintenance&#13;
is usually budgeted or carried out. The studies have identified 14,970 km (90%&#13;
classified) for which various strategies of improvement are technically and economically&#13;
justified.&#13;
3.8   Objectives. To alleviate rural poverty by improving access to social services and&#13;
market in remote rural areas and prepare the ground for further social and economic&#13;
development of remote montainous areas.&#13;
3.9   Description. The project will help finalize highway reclassification and will&#13;
improve 1,133 km of unpaved rural roads to all-weather standards. The improvement&#13;
works include earthworks to correct bad spots, construction of drainage infrastructure and&#13;
laying a base/surfacing layer of natural gravel. Finally, the project will construct 96 kan&#13;
of paved rural roads to a low-volume road standard (4 m of pavement over 8 m of&#13;
formation for a design speed of 60 kmlh)&#13;

Cost and Financing&#13;
3.11  Local governments are expected to cofinance an average of 12.5% of the 10,000&#13;
km national rural road program. While this ratio is expected to also apply to the project&#13;
roads, the specific sections for such cofinancing have not yet been identified. For the&#13;
rehabilitation of unpaved rural roads, the average base cost of the improvement works&#13;
is Dh 198,000/km ($22,500/km). One hundred and thirty three km will be financed by&#13;
local sources (the central and local governments) in 1995 and 1996 while the remaining&#13;
1,000 km will be financed at 72% by the Bank. For the construction of paved rural&#13;
roads, the average cost is Dh 826,000/km ($96,100/km).&#13;
Implementation&#13;
3.12 Reclassification of the highway network. The Ministries involved signed an&#13;
inter-ministerial bylaw on August 10, 1993 and issued corresponding circulars to set up&#13;
the required Provincial Reclassification Committees. The Communes do not currently&#13;
have the resources needed to operate and maintain a large network. Furthermore, a large&#13;
portion of unpaved rural roads is not yet in maintainable shape (non-engineered tracks&#13;
that received only sporadic emergency maintenance from MPW and need improvement&#13;
before being entered into scheduled maintenance programs). Therefore, no ownership&#13;
transfer is currently necessary. The initial reclassification is scheduled to be completed&#13;
by December 31, 1995.&#13;

3.13 Funding of road maintenance. Recent progress has been satisfactory, however&#13;
funding of road maintenance may be more difficult in the next few years. In 1995, the&#13;
Road Fund has been considerably increased, through higher fuel taxes, to reach Dh 1.090&#13;
million. The increase (Dh 460 million) has been earmarked to finance the 10,000 km&#13;
national rural road construction program. During negotiations, an understanding was&#13;
reached that the Government will give high priority to funding maintenance of classified&#13;
roads and that the corresponding needs will be evaluated on the basis of the indicators&#13;
below.&#13;

3.14  Organization. DRCR will implement the road works through its Provincial&#13;
Directorates (DPTP) using the road fund to finance the national rural road construction&#13;
program.&#13;
3.15 For the sections cofinanced by a local government, an agreement will be signed&#13;
between local authorities and the Government through the MPW. Among other things,&#13;
the agreement will specifically spell out:&#13;
(a)   financing shares of the improvement works;&#13;
(b)  implementation and disbursement procedures; and&#13;
(c)  the responsibilities and duties of the DPTP.&#13;
3.16 Schedule. Implementation of 133 km has started in 1995 under local financing.&#13;
The works program for 1996 (192 km) is in Annex 3.1: Mrst Year Program. The&#13;
programs for the second (404 km) and third (500 kIn) years will be selected among the&#13;
14,970 km targeted for improvement during the technico-economic screening process.&#13;
The following criteria will be used for selection:&#13;
(a)  indicator of traffic interruptions;&#13;
(b)   social and administrative importance of the zone of influence;&#13;
(c)   agricultural potential of the zone of influence;&#13;
3. The appropriations are computed by dividing the sum of road maintenance items&#13;
(routine, periodic and rehabilitation) from all budgets, but excluding overhead expenses,&#13;
equipment and general studies, by the length of the classified roads (in 1995: 30,374 km&#13;
of paved roads and 30,075 km of unpaved roads).&#13;
&#13;

D. BRANCH ROADS&#13;
Concept and Content&#13;
3.17 Policy. The quality of the branch roads has been identified as being a weak point&#13;
in highway transport. These roads connect the rural feeder roads to the secondary social&#13;
and economic centers and these centers to the main trunk highways, They are in the&#13;
process of being reclassified from the old categories of Secondary and Tertiary to&#13;
National, Regional and Provincial. The extent of the branch road network (about 20,040&#13;
km) is roughly adequate for the current road transport demand and the need to access&#13;
rural and remote areas, however, most of its pavement is now too old, narrow and thin&#13;
for its traffic. Furthermore, it suffered the most when maintenance budgets were&#13;
restricted. About 34% of the secondary and 43% of the tertiary roads are currently&#13;
classified as being unacceptable shape. About 7% of primary, 14% of secondary and&#13;
44% of tertiary paved roads have pavements narrower than 4 m. MPW has developed&#13;
a systematic approach for the rehabilitation of the branch road network that combines&#13;
pavement widening and overlaying with a resurfacing program to also reabsorb the&#13;
periodic maintenance backlog. The selection of both the sections and the type of works&#13;
is based on network-wide analyses carried out with the Bank's model HDM III, with&#13;
input data from the road data bank, which is systematically updated by periodic road data&#13;
collections. The process takes into account the technical advantages and the cost&#13;
reduction associated with combining widening with overlay. The overall strategy and the&#13;
balance between costly structural overlay providing a good service level to the road user&#13;
and more cost efficient resurfacing, has been defined to maximize the length of roads&#13;
with good service levels to the year 2002, under the most probable budget constraint.&#13;
Thereafter, the proportion of structural overlays is expected to decrease.&#13;
3.18 Preparation. A specific study of classified narrow roads set up the methodology&#13;
for selecting and justifying widening works, and identified 3,000 km on which feasibility&#13;
studies were carried out to select the sections for widening. Separate network-wide&#13;
studies have selected and justified the remaining sections.&#13;

3.20 Description. The identified roads consist of several sections in the seven regions,&#13;
for an average length of 12.6 km. Individual sections are from 1 to 55 km long, have an&#13;
existing pavement from 3 to 7 m wide and carry from 500 to 6,400 vehicles adt. The&#13;
sections in best shape, i.e. with acceptable cracking, roughness and width will have&#13;
potholes patched, pavement edges repaired, cracks sealed, side ditches reshaped, culverts&#13;
and other drainage elements cleaned, shoulders overlaid and leveled and then will receive&#13;
a double base surface treatment (DBST). Sections with higher roughness but with&#13;
acceptable remaining pavement life will, in addition, receive a thin reshaping layer&#13;
(gravel-emulsion mixture) just before the DBST is laid. Sections with little remaining&#13;
pavement life will receive a structural overlay instead of the reshaping layer. Sections&#13;
earmarked for widening will have pavements widened to 6 or 7 m, depending on the&#13;
traffic (threshold at 4,000 adt) and formations widened to 8, 10 or 12 m, depending on&#13;
the traffic and the relief. In general, widening and structural overlays will use thick&#13;
layers of crushed natural gravel, mechanically stabilized.&#13;
3.21 Indicators. Three sets of indicators will be used for monitoring progress in&#13;
achieving project objectives, from the network point of view, from the project element&#13;
point of view and finally from the individual section point of view. Target values are&#13;
indicated in table 3.4.&#13;

Cost and Financing&#13;
3.22  Unit costs of the cost estimates are based on a detailed analysis of actual cost of&#13;
similar works in 1989-1991, updated to 1995. Quantities are defined on the basis of&#13;
preliminary engineering (general cross-sections based on Moroccan standards, and&#13;
information in the road data base checked and complemented by specific field&#13;
investigations). The cost of the detailed design of the pavement and of quality control&#13;
during implementation is estimated at 5% of the cost of the road works.&#13;

3.23 OECF, Japan will finance 1,624 km in parallel with the Bank. The financing&#13;
allocation has been done on a regional basis, with OECF financing all four types of&#13;
works and the corresponding consultant services in five regions (Centre, Centre-Nord,&#13;
Centre-Sud, Nord-Ouest and Tensift). For the two other regions (Oriental and South),&#13;
the Government will finance 210 km in 1996 and the World Bank will finance 385 km&#13;
in 1997 and 1998.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
3.24 Organization. DRCR will implement this element also through DPTP. The&#13;
DPTPs will act as the Owner's representative for contractual relationships and as such,&#13;
finalize the pavement designs, define the detailed contract elements and make sure that&#13;
the project items are executed within the defined project objectives. As is the practice in&#13;
DRCR for contracts of this size, the DPTPs will also act as the Engineer, administer the&#13;
road works contract, make the measurements and give contractual orders to the&#13;
contractor, while quality and material control will be subcontracted to the regional road&#13;
laboratories (LPEE).&#13;
3.25  However, in an effort to test organizational arrangements that have been proven&#13;
successful in other countries, a supervising consultant will be appointed on a pilot basis&#13;
to supervise road works in the Oriental region (Provinces of Bouarfa, Oujda and Nador).&#13;
This corresponds to about 15% of the cost of the element. The short term objective is&#13;
to implement tighter quality control schemes, streamline the role of the DPTPs and&#13;
privatize some tasks that could be implemented more efficiently by the private sector. In&#13;
general, for a given DPTP, there is no continuity in the workload for this type of&#13;
supervision and thus, as the type, qualification and experience required from personnel&#13;
may be different from what is necessary to carry out the other duties, hiring out more&#13;
specialized consultants to face a peak in workload should be a good strategy. The longer&#13;
term objective is to develop the consulting industry and improve the quality of road&#13;
designs by giving consultants the opportunity to get hands-on experience and feed-back&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                                                Chapter i&#13;
on details and constructibility of their road designs. Road works will be grouped into&#13;
contract packages of various sizes, best suited to attract international, national and local&#13;
contractors, wherever appropriate and feasible.&#13;
3.26 Schedule. Implementation of 210 km has started in 1995 under local financing.&#13;
Implementation of 1,624 km will start in 1996 under OECF cofinancing. The work&#13;
program for the Bank's financing will start in 1997 (193 kIn) and in 1998 (192 kIn).&#13;
Individual sections will be selected using an agreed methodology (para 4.13).&#13;
E. NETWORK MANAGEMENT&#13;
Concept and Content&#13;
3.27 Policy. DRCR is in the process of improving its organizational setup, aiming at&#13;
better network management through the development of newly created Regional&#13;
Directorates (RD). The role of these Regional Directorates will focus on four main&#13;
themes: network management; technical excellence; the project cycle and communication&#13;
dynamics (Document in project file: Framework for Regionalization).&#13;
3.28 Preparation of this element was carried out by DRCR.&#13;
3.29 Physical Objectives&#13;
(a)   Network management:&#13;
(i)   Procurement of 30 utility vehicles and 7 low-bed trucks for&#13;
operating the road network, and replacement of 14 pieces of snow&#13;
removal equipment.&#13;
(ii)   Development of a realistic road equipment rental tariff.&#13;
(iii) Implementation and development of the pavement management&#13;
system in the RDs.&#13;
(iv)  Training of road personnel.&#13;
(b)   Technical excellence:&#13;
(i)   Technical support to the newly created Environment Unit and&#13;
development of the RDs' awareness of environment issues.&#13;
(ii)   Development of the RDs' capability and expertise in planning and&#13;
programming of road works.&#13;
(c)   Project cycle:&#13;
(i)   Study of the phasing and coherence of improvement works over&#13;
major branches of the network.&#13;
(d)   Communication dynamics:&#13;
(i)   development of communication methods and skills on pilot&#13;
projects.&#13;

7he Project                                                             37&#13;
(a)   Force account v/s contractors. Maintenance by force account is now&#13;
limited to emergency maintenance and routine maintenance activities and&#13;
opening/improving of unpaved rural roads for which there are no piece-&#13;
meal workers or contractors available in the region. Following this move&#13;
to contracting out, DRCR's equipment fleet is now under-utilized and&#13;
aging. DRCR intends to transfer responsibility for managing the fleet to&#13;
the RDs, aiming to increase its efficiency and reduce its running costs.&#13;
This requires increasing its mobility with low-bed trucks. The RDs will&#13;
also keep a dialogue with the regional road construction industry and be&#13;
the nerve center for promoting and testing actions aimed at maintaining&#13;
the current momentum away from force account works to more mainte-&#13;
nance works by contract.&#13;
(b)   Quality. The RDs will monitor the quality of the service DRCR is&#13;
offering to the road users, initiate preventive actions and carry out specific&#13;
audits at the request of MPW.&#13;
(c)   Monitoring of studies and works. The RDs will manage and improve the&#13;
road data bank and develop procedures for regular collection of traffic and&#13;
road inventory data. The RDs will coordinate efforts for improved project&#13;
management. The project will develop a specific project monitoring tool,&#13;
(para 3.77) integrating project and construction task management with&#13;
financial management and building a management information system&#13;
around it.&#13;
(d)   Personmel. The RDs will be essential elements in training and career&#13;
development of technical staff. The training of DRCR staff will focus on&#13;
network management, project management, scheduling, and programming.&#13;
The project will complement training actions with study tours and will&#13;
provide international experts.&#13;
3.31 Technical Excellence. The DPTPs face from time to time technical or economic&#13;
problems that require outside expertise, such adapting selected road technologies to local&#13;
conditions. The RDs will be natural clearing houses for developing regional expertise and&#13;
privileged recipients of technology transfers. The project will provide a mechanism for&#13;
finding and mobilizing such expertise with minimum delay. Expertise will be needed in&#13;
the following fields in particular:&#13;
(a)   road safety;&#13;
(b)   environmental impact of road works; and&#13;
(c)   use of local materials.&#13;
3.32 Project Cycle. The economic planning and programming of road investments,&#13;
once tentative, is now institutionalized with annual Bank reviews. DRCR now intends to&#13;
develop planning and programming capabilities at the Regional level. Improvements will&#13;
be sought in the following fields:&#13;
(a)   Research to find the optimum balance among various types of road invest-&#13;
ments (maintenance v/s construction; types of works; class of road;&#13;
regional balance; etc.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                                                                Chapter Iff&#13;
(b)   Integration of the regional level in the overall planning process.&#13;
(c)   Development of the RDs' programming capabilities on the basis of the&#13;
HDM III model.&#13;
(d)   Regular updating of vehicle operating costs.&#13;
(e)   As TA to institutional development, a study will look at how road&#13;
improvements could be phased and integrated over major itineraries. The&#13;
study will define and rank the possible improvements and define parame-&#13;
ters for optimal phasing overtime. This will ensure coherence of the&#13;
investments and minimize total cost over the long term.&#13;
3.33 Communication Dynamics. The RDs will be at the hubs of information circulation.&#13;
They will in particular properly organize the information elements,process them, and&#13;
setup and lead teams to tackle specific issues.&#13;

The Project                                                                   39&#13;
F. ROAD SAFETY&#13;
Concept and Content&#13;
3.37 Policy. There is an increasing trend in road accidents and fatalities, as well as&#13;
in indicators of fatality rate' and risk6. Officials are increasingly aware that the number&#13;
of unsafe roads has reached levels intolerable for Morocco at its current development&#13;
level. To significantly reverse the current trend, the Government is committed to&#13;
implementing a comprehensive and multi-faceted road safety program, focusing simulta-&#13;
neously on key but complementary elements, implemented in a sustained effort over a&#13;
long period.&#13;
3.38 Preparation. Two road safety experts were appointed to carry out a country-wide&#13;
review and analysis of all major road safety elements, using a methodology originally&#13;
developed for Eastern and Central Europe to assess the effectiveness of road safety&#13;
measures and permit reliable comparisons between countries. On the basis of this and&#13;
other data and analyses, a National Symposium was organized June 8 &amp; 9, 1993 to&#13;
debate the various actions and strategies.&#13;
3.39 Objectives. The immediate objective will be to reverse the escalating trend in&#13;
annual road fatalities. In the medium term, the objective will be to return to an average&#13;
level of road fatality risk for low-motorized countries according to the Smeed relationship&#13;
(para 2.10). Thereafter, the objective will be to keep the forward momentum and avoid&#13;
any new growth in annual road fatalities. (Figure 3.7: Fatalities &amp; Fatality Risk).&#13;
3.40 Description. This element will include in particular:&#13;
(a)   institutional improvements:&#13;
(i)   increase budgetary financing for preventive actions;&#13;
(ii)   substantially increase road enforcement fines;&#13;
(iii)  systematically introduce safety audits;&#13;
(iv)  training and technical assistance.&#13;
(b)   a rehabilitation program for accident black-spots; and&#13;
(c)    procurement of enforcement equipment.&#13;
3.41  Institutional improvements. After the awareness level, the most influential factor&#13;
on the efficiency of road safety actions is the institutional setup, because its nature calls&#13;
for close coordination between several sectors (transport, education, interior, information,&#13;
etc.) to obtain the necessary synergetic effect. The experience shows that two conditions&#13;
are needed, political accountability given to a single Government member and an&#13;
administrative coordination structure in charge of preparing strategies, implementing&#13;
them and evaluating their effects. In Morocco, these two elements are already in place&#13;

6/ Number killed per thousand vehicles&#13;

and would be fine tuned under the project. The Minister of Transport is explicitly in&#13;
charge of road safety, however, horizontal coordination is currently carried out through&#13;
ad-hoc committees on specific road safety issues.&#13;

3.44 Road safety audits have proven to be a new and valuable tool for identifying,&#13;
before road works are carried out, road design features that are relatively unsafe and,&#13;
for existing roads, identifying potential safety hazards that could be removed with&#13;
relatively low cost remedial actions. A pilot audit on 2,800 km of roads has already&#13;
allowed identification of 500 black spots and progressive development of a methodology&#13;
for designing a program of low cost remedial actions. The project will support further&#13;
development of this concept.&#13;
3.45 For both CNPAC and DRCR, the project will support limited technical assistance&#13;
from appropriate road safety experts and training abroad for staff.&#13;
3.46 Rehabilitation of road accident black-spots. The project will finance three year&#13;
of the national rehabilitation program for high accident areas, estimated at Dh 80 million.&#13;
3.47 Enforcement of the Highway Code. No road safety improvement program would&#13;
show significant result over a sustained period without the strict enforcement of&#13;
appropriate laws and regulations. Setting up appropriate speed limits, making safety belts&#13;
and helmets mandatory, preventing driving-while-intoxicated, regulating maximum&#13;
driving time for professional drivers and instituting a point system for driving licenses&#13;
are proven road safety measures. They are the most efficient measures available when&#13;
complemented by appropriate sanctions and strictly enforced. They are almost worthless&#13;
otherwise. Most of these measures are being introduced in the revision of the Highway&#13;
Code that is being prepared for rapid submission to Parliament, with a hardened and&#13;
dissuasive schedule of fines and legal sanctions. The rest are being considered. However,&#13;
the most critical need is to improve enforcement. The project will support this&#13;
improvement by financing 70 radars and vehicles for speed limit enforcement on inter-&#13;
urban roads for the Gendarmerie and providing corresponding technical assistance and&#13;
training. This effort is essential because of its expected impact on road user behavior.&#13;
3.48 Indicators. The following indicators will be used to monitor progress. They are&#13;
based on projections of population and vehicle fleet growth, and Smeed's relationship.&#13;
Details on the assumptions are in Annex 2.2.&#13;

element, and CNPAC will be the implementing agency. Once procured, ownership of the&#13;
enforcement and rescue equipment will be transferred to the relevant units of Gendarmer-&#13;
ie. The black-spot rehabilitation program and the highway safety audit element will be&#13;
implemented by DRCR.&#13;
G. ROAD TRANSPORT&#13;
Concept and Content&#13;
3.51 Policy. Agreement was reached at Negotiations that, in order to liberalize the&#13;
trucking market and to promote greater trucking efficiency, the Government will:&#13;
(a)   permit unrestrictedfor-hire operations of trucks weighing eight tons gross&#13;
or less;&#13;
(b)   abolish the mandatory use of ONTfor road freight forwarding;&#13;
(c)   eliminate trucking tariff controls; and&#13;
(d)   introduce simplified procedures and professional qualification standards&#13;
for access to the trucking industry, without any quantitative limits.&#13;
3.52 These principles are spelled out in the Letter of Sector Strategy (Annex 3.2: Letter&#13;
of Sector Strategy), which has been signed as a condition of Board Presentation. A&#13;
covenant specifies that presentation to Parliament of the corresponding law will be done&#13;
by December 31, 1998.&#13;
3.53 Preparation. Implementation of the above policy means a drastic change in&#13;
ONT's mission as well as its restructuring. ONT may still play an important role in the&#13;
new enviromnent, but this role would be service-oriented and demand-driven. Studies are&#13;
in progress to ascertain service areas where ONT could redirect its activity and define&#13;
a new corporate plan. Upon conclusion of these studies by mid-1995, an action plan will&#13;
be prepared to facilitate the transition and minimize social costs associated with staff lay-&#13;
offs and redeployment. ONT is expected to maintain a freight forwarding function, play&#13;
a more active role in training and advising truckers, create conditions conducive to&#13;
creation of small to medium size trucking companies, and bridge existing gaps in the&#13;
organization of land transport, through establishment of trucking service centers along&#13;
most trafficked roads and trucking stations in the vicinity of main international ports.&#13;

3.56 OECF, Japan will finance 72% of some of the paved branch roads in selected&#13;
regions. The Bank will finance 72% of the remaining civil works and 100% of the cost&#13;
(taxes excluded) of goods and services.&#13;
3.57 Implementation of some works started during the period between Appraisal and&#13;
Negotiations, however, because these sections are fully financed from local sources, there&#13;
is no retroactive financing for the World Bank loan.&#13;
L. PROCUREMENT&#13;
Works&#13;
3.58 Works will be procured under Bank Guidelines. The amounts and methods of pro-&#13;
curement are in Table 3.12: Procurement Arrangements. Works on paved roads, will be&#13;
bid by International Competitive Bidding (ICB), using one of the Bank's standard bidding&#13;
documents on a slice-and-package basis, when the estimated amount is $2 million or&#13;
more. The slices will consist of works within a single Province. The corresponding&#13;
DPTP will be responsible for finalizing the pavement design and supervising the works,&#13;
as the contractual Owner's Representative. Bid advertising, opening and evaluation will&#13;
be carried out at the Regional level. Contractors will be permitted to offer rebates if&#13;
awarded more than one slice. Contract amounts will range from $0.4 to $5.0 million per&#13;
slice and from $1.0 to $10.0 million per package. The larger amounts should be&#13;
attractive to international contractors not already present in Morocco.&#13;
3.59 A prequalification process, satisfactory to the Bank and updated annually, will&#13;
evaluate contractors on the basis of their capacity to carry out project works satisfactori-&#13;
ly. The process will be based on the satisfactory completion of works of similar size and&#13;
nature, contractor's personnel and equipment, and his financial situation. After&#13;
prequalification, potential bidders will be classified to bid for one or more slices, up to&#13;
their evaluated capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                                                   45&#13;
3.60 Unpaved rural road works are dispersed throughout remote locations and are&#13;
difficult to package for ICB. Thus they will be bid through Local Competitive Bidding&#13;
(LCB) and carried out by small local contractors under the supervision of the DPTP, who&#13;
will be the Owner's Representative. The DPTP will have contractual authority to order&#13;
and certify works and authorize payments. Because of the novelty of this type of work&#13;
for the contracting industry, prequalification procedures will be used and updated&#13;
annually on a regional basis. Other civil works, will also be procured by LCB.&#13;

3.61 Procurement of bitumen products for roadworks is usually done from the only&#13;
supplier located in Morocco, by DPTP, for all its works within the province, at rates&#13;
approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mining. Under the Highway Sector Project, the&#13;
supply of bituminous products was included in the bidding documents, however, bidders&#13;
had the choice to either include bituminous products in their bid prices or to request&#13;
DPTP to supply them the bitumen at the set rate. In the latter case, the bidding procedure&#13;
produced two contracts, one for the works and one for the supply of bitumen, both of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46                                                                Chapter III&#13;
which were will be eligible for Bank financing. Although this procedure worked&#13;
satisfactorily, under the proposed project it will be mandatory for the contractors to buy&#13;
their own bitumen. In line with world-wide practice, this change will streamline&#13;
contractual responsibilities, reduce potential coordination conflicts and lighten the&#13;
administrative workload of DPTP. The contracts will include provisions for quality&#13;
controls at the production site.&#13;
Goods&#13;
3.62 Most of the goods (vehicles and equipment) will be procured under ICB in a slice-&#13;
and-package procurement procedure per implementing agency. Eligible domestic&#13;
manufacturers would receive the 15% preference margin in bid evaluation under ICB.&#13;
Some software, some documentation and small equipment, of a value of less than&#13;
$100,000 for each contract, which for reasons of procurement efficiency and/or schedule&#13;
could not be procured under ICB, will be procured by LCB (maximum aggregated&#13;
amount of $1.6 million) or international shopping (minimum three quotations; maximum&#13;
aggregated amount of $1.5 million). Proprietary software and technical documentation&#13;
will be procured directly from the original manufacturers for a maximum aggregated&#13;
amount of $40,000.&#13;
Consulting Services&#13;
3.63 Consulting services will be procured according to Bank Guidelines. Consulting&#13;
services for detailed pavement design and quality control during construction, estimated&#13;
at $2.8 million, will be procured from LPEE, the government-owned road laboratory,&#13;
because the project works are too small and too scattered to attract other laboratories.&#13;
3.64 The technical support to DRCR, training abroad of DRCR staff and the supply&#13;
of software and technical documentation will be grouped into framework agreements with&#13;
joint-venture consulting firms offering a wide range of experts. The contracts will spell&#13;
out rates and procedures for identification and mobilization of the personnel and&#13;
procedures for participation of DRCR staff to international seminars and refresher&#13;
courses. The agreements will include the payment of tuition and transport and per diem&#13;
for trainees. Most interventions will be short in time with a short period between the&#13;
definition of the expertise and the mobilization of the expert. The framework agreements,&#13;
estimated at $4.2 million, will be procured from a short-list of international consulting&#13;
ventures, in accordance with Bank Guidelines.&#13;
3.65 Training in Morocco for DRCR will be organized by Ecole Hassania des Travaux&#13;
Publics or IFEER. Training for Road Safety and Road Transport will be organized by&#13;
training operators who will be procured from short-lists in accordance with Bank&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
3.66 The Study of Road Itineraries and other consulting services and technical&#13;
assistance, estimated at $0.6 million, will be procured from short-listed firms or&#13;
individual experts selected by the executing agencies. The short-lists will not include&#13;
more than two firms from the same country.&#13;

3.67 Publicly owned consulting firms will not be eligible to participate, even as&#13;
partners in joint-ventures, unless they meet the following criteria:&#13;
(a)   independent, commercially oriented legal entity;&#13;
(b)   reasonably autonomous financially (as shown by the nature of its revenues&#13;
in audited accounts);&#13;
(c)   managerially autonomous; and&#13;
(d)   able to meet all qualifications and contractual obligations.&#13;
General&#13;
3.68 Works contracts below a threshold of $1.5 million and goods contracts below a&#13;
threshold of $0.5 million will not be subject to prior review. Other contracts will be&#13;
subject to prior review. This review process will cover about 85% of the total value of&#13;
Bank-financed items and may cover 100%, if the Ministry of Finance continues the&#13;
current practice of systematically requesting Bank approval before any financial commit-&#13;
ment.&#13;
3.69 LCB procedures are generally found acceptable to the Bank, a few changes are&#13;
however required to make some procedures acceptable to the Bank (Annex 3.4: LCB Pro-&#13;
cedures). During negotiations, agreement was reached on all the above procurement&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
J. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.70 The Bank will disburse on the basis of Table 3.13: Allocation and Disbursement&#13;
of the Loan. The Loan is expected to become effective in October 1995, and to be fully&#13;
disbursed by the closing date of June 30, 2000. This is six months shorter than the&#13;
historical 6.5-year disbursement profile for transport projects in Morocco. The disburse-&#13;
ment schedule is in Annex 3.3. Project completion is expected by December 31, 1999.&#13;
3.71  Full documentation will be required for disbursements for consulting services and&#13;
training procured under contracts valued at more than $0.1 million, for works valued at&#13;
more than $0.5 million, and for goods valued at more than $0.25 million. All other dis-&#13;
bursements will be made against Statement of Expenditures. Supporting documents will&#13;
be made available to Bank supervision missions and to the auditor. These documents will&#13;
be retained for one year after Bank receipt of the audit report for the fiscal year in which&#13;
the last withdrawal from the loan account was made.&#13;
3.72 To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account will be opened and maintained in&#13;
a fully convertible and stable currency and operated on terms and conditions satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank. The Special Account will cover the Bank's share of eligible expenses in both&#13;
local and foreign currencies. The authorized allocation will be $4.3 million, i.e. the&#13;
Bank's share of the estimated four-month average of project expenditures. The borrower&#13;
will submit regular monthly replenishment applications promptly after receipt and&#13;
reconciliation of monthly bank statements from the bank holding the account. During&#13;

K. WORKSHOPS, IMPLEMENTATION, REPORTING AND AUDITING&#13;
3.73 The project implementation schedule has been developed with project management&#13;
software, a summary is in Annex 3.5. The technical assistance to DRCR for network&#13;
management includes the purchase of software and training for promoting the use of&#13;
project management principles and software, first at DRCR headquarters and second at&#13;
the Regional Directorates and finally at the DPTPs. Also, DRCR will receive assistance&#13;
to develop a specific computer application (in the Windows environment) to integrate&#13;
scheduling software with procurement monitoring and financial monitoring (commitments&#13;
and disbursements) in both Dirhams and US Dollars. The application will be a single&#13;
place to record important project information, to monitor procurement, schedule,&#13;
covenants, indicators, unallocated amounts of the Bank loan, availability of cofinancing&#13;
and counterpart funds, the expected cost at completion, keep project accounts, including&#13;
commitments, report progress and keep track of historical changes and prepare disburse-&#13;
ment forecasts. DRCR has agreed to develop the application in such a way that its core&#13;
programming could be easily transposed for use in other foreign-financed projects in&#13;
Morocco.&#13;
3.74 The project will include a kick-off workshop before project effectiveness. The&#13;
workshop will put together participants (CNPAC, DRCR and its regional and provincial&#13;
Directors, Finance officers and a representative sample of Local Governments) and&#13;
finalize details of project implementation procedures (administrative, financial manage-&#13;
ment and procurement).&#13;
3.75 Before the third project year, the same participants will meet again for a mid-term&#13;
adjustment workshop. Agreement on the mandate of the mid-term adjustment workshop,&#13;
the format and content of the progress reports and of the completion report was reached&#13;
at negotiations. The mandate of the workshop will include, in particular, the review of:&#13;
(a)   implementation of the sectoral and project objectives;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                 49&#13;
(b)   implementation schedule and project impact indicators;&#13;
(c)   expenditure levels in the implementation of the maintenance and invest-&#13;
ment programs and their sources of funding;&#13;
(d)   planned expenditure levels for the coming three years by major category&#13;
of expenditure, including financing;&#13;
(e)   composition and status of all project activities.&#13;
3.76 The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Morocco. The implementing agencies will&#13;
be DRCR and CNPAC for their respective project components.&#13;
3.77  Each implementing agency will prepare quarterly progress reports in a format&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. Each report will give project indicators data, indicate progress&#13;
made, problems encountered, remedial steps proposed and project activities scheduled&#13;
for the next quarter. At the end, DRCR will prepare the overall project completion report&#13;
(integrating input from CNPAC), which will be issued no later than six months after the&#13;
physical completion of the project works. This report will include in particular, a detailed&#13;
account of final project costs and disbursements, general characteristics of project&#13;
execution and benefits, the degree to which project objectives were achieved and an&#13;
assessment of how the Government and the Bank implemented their respective&#13;
obligations.&#13;
3.78  The implementing agencies will maintain separate records and accounts for all&#13;
project expenditures. These records will identify all project transactions on an on-going&#13;
basis and show their financing. All supporting documentation will be retained for audit&#13;
and review by the Bank. Quarterly accounts will be prepared in a format approved by&#13;
the Bank and incorporated in the quarterly progress reports. These accounts will&#13;
summarize actual v/s planned expenditures both per fiscal year and cumulated to date.&#13;
3.79 An independent auditor, acceptable to the Bank, will audit the project accounts&#13;
each fiscal year. The audit will employ principles acceptable to the Bank and will cover&#13;
the Special Account, the financial statements and the Statements of Expenditures. The&#13;
reports will be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the end of the fiscal&#13;
year.&#13;
L. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
3.80 As road works will be limited to improvement and maintenance of existing roads&#13;
with no alignment change, no serious potentially adverse environmental impact is&#13;
expected. The project has environmental benefits (development of the Environment Unit,&#13;
environment-conscious institutional improvements, improved accessibility, reduced&#13;
damage/soil erosion, and improved vehicular and pedestrian safety). Special attention will&#13;
be paid to providing adequate drainage, ensuring slope stability and preserving&#13;
archeological materials in excavations. In accordance with established guidelines, the&#13;
project has been rated B.&#13;
3.81  The roads works (widening, surfacing, strengthening) appraised have been&#13;
carefully assessed with regards to their potential effects on the environment. There will&#13;
be no alignment change nor any resettlement; erosion control will be incorporated into&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50                                                                Chapter III&#13;
the engineering design; and materials selection will follow environment-aware technical&#13;
guidelines. Before they would start, the road works will have followed a two-step&#13;
environmental screening: first, DPTP will have filled out a specific questionnaire to&#13;
identify potential enviromnental risks and, second, any identified potential adverse&#13;
impacts will have been addressed and mitigating measures implemented.&#13;
3.82 Once completed, these works will be beneficial to the environment by reducing&#13;
congestion, improving accessibility to markets, schools and medical services and&#13;
improving pedestrian and vehicular safety. The highway safety, network management and&#13;
institutional developments component will have a highly positive impact on the&#13;
environment. The highway safety improvements will reduce human casualties and will&#13;
decrease the risk of accidental pollution thus alleviating infrastructure threats to health&#13;
and the natural environment (water, soils). The network management component is&#13;
environmentally friendly since it is principally aimed at improving routine maintenance.&#13;
The ability to assess the environmental impact of roads works will be fostered within the&#13;
institutional development component. In close coordination with the Under-Secretary of&#13;
State for the Environment, Ministry of Interior, DRCR has created an internal&#13;
environment office to develop operational guidelines for environmental impact assessment&#13;
of all the major road works, provide guidance and coordinate actions on environment&#13;
issues related to road works.&#13;

SECONDARY, TERTIARY AND RURAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
0v. 1E1CO)MON)C JUSTOFDCATOC)N&#13;
A. GENERAL&#13;
4.1    Scope of analysis. An analysis to establish economic justification will be done&#13;
for the main components of the proposed project, i.e. rural roads, branch roads and road&#13;
maintenance equipment. The economic evaluation does not include technical assistance&#13;
for network management, or road safety actions. It is a generally accepted fact that&#13;
institution-building is essential to ensure the sustainability of project benefits, through&#13;
more effective programming and execution of future road projects, as well as better&#13;
returns for roads expenditures. Although these benefits would materialize in various&#13;
forms, they significantly outweigh the technical assistance expenditures entailed. As far&#13;
as road safety is concerned, the project inaugurates at still a modest level the kind of&#13;
systematic action which will need to be to be developed and amplified if the national&#13;
scourge of road casualties and fatalities has any chance to be curbed and brought back&#13;
to normal proportion. The 1990 National Transport Master Plan7 made a compelling&#13;
argument on how much is at stake by making road uses safer. Based on conditions&#13;
prevailing in 1988, the direct economic costs per fatality was estimated as Dh 273,000&#13;
or 40 times the average GDP per capita. In 1994 prices, it brings total economic losses&#13;
from road fatalities to more than Dh 0.7 billion. Including social costs more than double&#13;
these losses. Casualties and property damages result in additional losses. Altogether,&#13;
accidents in Morocco may cost as much as Dh 10 billion per year in terms of direct&#13;
economic losses and close to twice as much when social costs are included. The&#13;
component for rehabilitation of road accident black spots implies investing Dh 1,25&#13;
million on average for each one. Given the higher frequency of accidents at these&#13;
locations (2-2,5 accident per year) resulting in annual losses equivalent to about DhO.8&#13;
million, social costs included, just reducing the frequency of road accidents by one-&#13;
fourth would ensure a normal economic return on the investment. Higher impacts on&#13;
road safety can reasonably be expected, an indication of the strong justification of the&#13;
component. Further details on the economic analysis methodology used are in the&#13;
Document in project file: Economic Evaluation Details.&#13;
4.2    Benefits. The major direct benefits will be derived from lower transport costs,&#13;
which will stimulate trade and help raise living standards in the areas served by the&#13;
project roads. Savings will come primarily from reduced vehicle operating costs and&#13;
lower road maintenance costs. Indirect benefits will be quite significant under the rural&#13;
roads component, which will improve access to remote rural areas, triggering production&#13;
and consumption effects. Agricultural inputs will become available at lower prices, and&#13;
products will be more competitive on the market. Improved accessibility will also extend&#13;
to social services, producing a healthier and better educated population. Agricultural&#13;
activities will benefit the most. Similar socioeconomic benefits can be cited to justify the&#13;

purchase of snow removal equipment. For the branch roads component, additional&#13;
benefits will flow from improvements in traffic conditions and road safety.&#13;
4.3   Risks. There are technical and financial risks. First, traffic counts and estimates&#13;
of vehicle operating costs can be inaccurate, as can estimates of project costs prior to the&#13;
bid stage. These uncertainties (most relevant for rural roads where the little traffic that&#13;
exists is quite volatile, the vehicle fleet differs from the national average in age and&#13;
structure, and the cost of civil works contracts depends on the level of competition,&#13;
which is difficult to predict) are addressed by a sensitivity analysis of the findings of the&#13;
economic analysis with the hypotheses selected. Second, central and local government&#13;
funding constraints may not only imperil execution of sub-projects, but may more&#13;
generally weaken the sector environment in which the project operates and jeopardize&#13;
achievement of its general objectives. The project will mitigate the risk of underfunding&#13;
of maintenance activities with the setting up of agreed maintenance budget monitoring&#13;
indicators, while the mechanism for cofinancing rural roads with local governments will&#13;
shape a local environment favorable to the success of the rural roads component.&#13;
4.4   Sustainability of investment. Maintaining the flow of benefits over the&#13;
economic life of the project will be contingent on ensuring adequate road maintenance&#13;
after implementation. Thus, sustainability prospects are enhanced by good institutional&#13;
arrangements, stable funding mechanisms and sound system administration, which the&#13;
project will endeavor to achieve.&#13;
B. RURAL ROADS&#13;
4.5   Selection of sections and investment level. This component is designed to&#13;
alleviate transport constraints in remote rural areas by improving their linkages to major&#13;
roads and reducing economic distances between villages to promote closer socioeconomic&#13;
integration. The economic feasibility study covered about 38,000 km of unpaved rural&#13;
roads, most of which are in bad to very bad condition because they were built scantily&#13;
and not maintained thereafter. The project roads were selected on the basis of an agreed&#13;
methodology. The sector approach means that this methodology will be used to define&#13;
the content of the second and third year of works. The content of the first year was&#13;
established on the basis of the results of conclusive economic studies, which nevertheless&#13;
will need to be redone: in the case of paving, to apply the agreed methodology; in the&#13;
case of unpaved roads, to reflect the shift from spot gravelling to general gravelling with&#13;
drainage. The revised rates of return on works under the first year will be reported to&#13;
the Bank by September 30, 1995. The methodology selected for economic analysis&#13;
consists of three steps: (a) the first step is to select the roads, adhering to minimum rates&#13;
of return at a threshold of 12% using one of the three possible construction standard.&#13;
About 15,000 km of rural roads met this criterion and comprise a pool of possible sub-&#13;
projects; (b) the second step is to ask local organizations to rank the sub-projects on the&#13;
basis of three criteria: frequency of road closing, importance of social and administrative&#13;
centers located in the area served by the roads, and the potential for agricultural&#13;
development in the area; (c) the third step is to carry out a detailed economic analysis&#13;
based on the HDM III model complemented by a modelling exercise to include the cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Economic Justification                                                      53&#13;
of road closing in the general case, and the creation of traffic in the case of paving.&#13;
Existing traffic is assumed to grow at an annual rate of 5%.&#13;
4.6   Benefits. The three main sources of benefits are as follows: (a) lower vehicle&#13;
operating costs through improved road service standards, linked to the construction&#13;
standard selected; substitution of standard two-wheel-drive vehicles for costlier all-terrain&#13;
vehicles being a source of additional benefits; (b) most identified roads are impassible&#13;
due to inclement weather for 30 days or more each year; recourse to non-motorized&#13;
transport during road closures will fall off, and be eliminated completely in the case of&#13;
paving projects (over 50% of the transport of people and goods is on foot or using&#13;
animals); (c) experience has shown that paving a rural road brings an increase in traffic&#13;
through the dual effect of generated and diverted traffic. Savings on maintenance are not&#13;
taken into account here, as most of these rural roads are not currently maintainable.&#13;
4.7   Beneficiaries. Direct beneficiaries are road users, first of all, and the populations&#13;
living in newly accessible remote rural areas: (a) feasibility studies show that average&#13;
vehicle operating costs on roads of poor condition are about Dh 5.2 per vehicle km,&#13;
falling to Dh 3.9 per vehicle km on a road in satisfactory condition, and to Dh 3 per&#13;
vehicle km on a paved road; (b) when roads are closed, those living in remote areas use&#13;
non-motorized transport, which is 2.1 times more expensive than motorized transport;&#13;
the resulting savings are theirs entirely.&#13;
4.8    Non-quantified benefits. These are considered in terms of lower prices for&#13;
products "imported" into the once inaccessible area, and additional income for local&#13;
producers "exported" to markets outside the area. Surveys have shown considerable price&#13;
differences (between 50% and 100%) between markets in well-served areas and markets&#13;
in inaccessible areas. Remote populations are often also the poorest, which makes the&#13;
impact of lower prices for products consumed and higher income for producers relatively&#13;
more important (average spending per capita is an estimated $350 in rural areas, or half&#13;
the average for the country as a whole). Improving access by road will also make the&#13;
local transportation market more competitive, ensuring that lower costs are passed on in&#13;
lower transport prices. Other non-quantified benefits include less damage to goods&#13;
transported under unreliable conditions and lower losses of produce that could not be&#13;
transported out in time. Finally, better access to socioeconomic services outside the area&#13;
(agricultural extension, schooling, hospitals or dispensaries) will raise living standards&#13;
over time.&#13;
4.9    Results and sensitivity analysis. The part of the first year program that&#13;
relates to paving 70 km of rural roads has yet to be evaluated. There is a strong&#13;
presumption of high returns on these operations. Economic studies done using a different&#13;
methodology have been presented by DRCR and show a minimum internal rate of return&#13;
of 33% for the Talsint-Anoual road (20 km) and a maximum internal rate of return of&#13;
80% for the Souk Larbaa-Had Court road (12 km). It was deemed preferable to&#13;
recalculate the rates of return since the data used were relatively old and in order to give&#13;
the same methodological treatment to all the project roads. The revised calculations will&#13;
be reported to the Bank no later than September 30, 1995. They will include the&#13;
sensitivity analysis to verify the values of the more decisive parameters (traffic and new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54                                                                  Chapter IV&#13;
traffic, cost of investment, duration of road closures and estimated cost thereof), which&#13;
would bring the internal rate of return to the threshold of 12%.&#13;
4.10 For the other sections included in the program for year one, the economic&#13;
calculations are also to be completed by September 30, 1995. These sections were&#13;
evaluated by the Bank in 1994, but at a lower construction standard. The results for the&#13;
four sections in the province of Settat (55 kIn) produced internal rates of return at that&#13;
time of between 62% and 102% for the base hypothesis, and 53% to 84% for the&#13;
hypothesis using a 15% higher investment cost. Internal rates of return for the base&#13;
hypothesis were 143% for the Zagora-Beni Zoli section in the province of Ouarzazate&#13;
and 74% for the J. Houafat-S. Med Oudad section in the province of Sidi Kacem. The&#13;
calculations should now be redone, however, using the correct construction standard.&#13;
4.11  Risks. The risk that the rural roads component of the project would not be&#13;
carried out for reasons having to do with insufficient commitment by the political&#13;
authorities seems unlikely if not non-existent, for this component is part of the vast&#13;
national program to build 10,000 km of rural roads in seven years, and the financing has&#13;
already been allocated under the 1995 Loi de Finance. A large part of the program, as&#13;
well as the sub-projects financed by the Bank, call for participation of the communes,&#13;
and their generally difficult financial situation could make this problematic. This risk is&#13;
minimized by the low rate of participation expected (12.5%) and the possibility of using&#13;
the Commune Infrastructure Fund, or allocating part of value-added tax revenues, or&#13;
even rescheduling works to a later date but with full Road Fund financing. The technical&#13;
risks at the implementation stage will be mitigated by strict quality standards in preparing&#13;
documents and evaluating bids and by DRCR follow-up on work under its purview. The&#13;
economic risk related to a poor assessment of local needs will be limited by broad-based&#13;
consultations with grassroots groups for the multi-criteria analysis stage, and by requiring&#13;
local communities to participate in order to verify that the expected economic benefits&#13;
are likely to be produced. In some cases (province of Azilal), non-road investments&#13;
planned by the Government will favor the development of newly accessible areas, making&#13;
the investment in roads even more worthwhile.&#13;
4.12 Sustainability of the investment. Proper maintenance of the project roads is&#13;
essential. Regular funding for maintenance must be ensured in a regular fashion, an&#13;
objective that is sought through the provisions on road budgets contained in the legal&#13;
documents. Sound programming and execution of the works is the other constraint, which&#13;
ties in to some extent with clarifying responsibilities for road administration, which will&#13;
be made easier by completion before the end of 1995 of the operation to reclassify road&#13;
systems that is now under way. In addition, the framework agreements between DRCR&#13;
and the provincial councils on implementing the rural road-building program will&#13;
facilitate more specific definitions of responsibilities shared by the two parties, ratifying&#13;
for example DRCR's role in managing the endeavor.&#13;

C. BRANCH ROADS&#13;
4.13 Selection of sections and investment level. A sector approach has been&#13;
adopted in identifying economically justifiable sub-projects. Rates of return will be&#13;
established by the methodology described in Economic Evaluation Details. Agreement&#13;
was reached during negotiations that this methodology will be used in selecting the&#13;
project routes for the second year program, and it was also used in evaluating the first&#13;
year program, with the findings indicated herein. In general terms, the methodology is&#13;
based on application of the HDM III model, with exogenous variables added to evaluate&#13;
rates of return on widening projects. Those variables include having to maintain the&#13;
shoulders of the roads, which are used by vehicles when passing and overtaking, and&#13;
increased vehicle operating costs on account of the repeated deceleration and acceleration&#13;
such maneuvers entail. Narrow paved roads (less than 4.5 m wide) makeup 55% of the&#13;
Moroccan system, and the proposed project will reduce the shortfall in capacity of many&#13;
of these. The program for the first year has been identified as follows:  (a) 15&#13;
homogeneous road categories were established to classify the approximately 30,000 km&#13;
of paved roads; traffic thresholds were calculated for each category using the HDM III&#13;
model to evaluate the maximum amount of investment for widening that would be&#13;
consistent with obtaining a rate of return of at least 12%; close to 4,000 km of roads&#13;
were shown to be potentially viable; (b) a multi-criteria analysis was then conducted to&#13;
rank the sections of roads presumed to satisfy the minimum return criterion; the first&#13;
criterion is road condition and existing traffic, the second net agricultural value added&#13;
per kilometer of project road. This analysis brought the list of roads considered eligible&#13;
for the project to a level compatible with the overall funding constraints, i.e. roads&#13;
covering about 700 km; (c) the roads ranking highest were then subjected to a detailed&#13;
economic analysis using the agreed methodology. It was determined that combining the&#13;
widening with the existing roadway treatments produced a 12% minimum rate of return&#13;
on the marginal investment for widening. This was done to offset insufficient returns on&#13;
widening operations per se with the generally high returns on resealing and strengthen-&#13;
ing. Annual growth in traffic of 4.5% is assumed.&#13;
4.14 Benefits. Benefits are derived from various sources: (a) vehicle operating costs&#13;
will be reduced by reducing roughness through strengthening and resealing work;&#13;
eliminating traffic on shoulders will be another factor in lowering vehicle operating costs&#13;
for widening works; finally, repeated deceleration and acceleration and reduced speed&#13;
in passing and overtaking on narrow roads entail increased costs that widening will&#13;
eliminate; (b) the cost of maintaining the shoulders and pavement edges will be reduced;&#13;
(c) studies have shown positive effects on road safety from widening from 6 to 7 m.&#13;
These effects have been modelled and included as exogenous factors in the model.&#13;
4.15 Beneficiaries. Road users and the network administration will be the immediate&#13;
beneficiaries: (a) the former will save on transportation costs; and (b) the administration&#13;
will save on its road maintenance and rehabilitation budget. The resealing and strengthen-&#13;
ing works provided for in this component are part of an optimum system maintenance&#13;
policy which has been found to be optimum in simulations using the HDM III model. It&#13;
can be said, then, that this component will contribute to the effort to bring down road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56                                                                Chapter IV&#13;
maintenance costs over the long term, and therefore helps reduce road budgets. In&#13;
addition, DRCR will benefit from combining strengthening/resealing and widening&#13;
operations, producing economies of scale estimated at 8.5% of the cost of the works.&#13;
Generally speaking, the proportion of benefits flowing to the administration ranges from&#13;
20% to 13% of the total when traffic on the project roads increases from 250 to 900&#13;
vehicles per day.&#13;
4.16 Non-quantified benefits. Consumers and producers will benefit indirectly from&#13;
the existence of an increasingly competitive market, and multiplier effects on incomes&#13;
are likely to occur. The benefits to the administration will allow it to cover a larger&#13;
system with a constant budget, with the secondary effect of increasing the number of&#13;
road users who will benefit directly from a system in better condition.&#13;
4.17 Results and sensitivity analysis. None of the project roads, which cover a&#13;
total of 385 kcm, is programmed for execution in 1996, so that no results of economic&#13;
analysis are available as yet. The studies will be done according to the agreed&#13;
methodology. From the results of the economic calculations done by the Bank in 1994&#13;
on more than 2,450 km of roads (from which the project roads will be selected), we can&#13;
assume a very strong economic justification for this component. Internal rates of return&#13;
ranged from 50% to 75% for the base hypothesis, 36% to 65% for the 15% cost overrun&#13;
hypothesis, and 40% to 71 % if traffic is overestimated by 20 %.&#13;
4.18 Risks. The risks appear to be low. There are good data on average daily traffic&#13;
and costs thanks to the quality of preparation studies and experience acquired by DRCR&#13;
on similar projects. The methodology for analysis of sub-projects in the year two and&#13;
year three programs has been mastered by DRCR, making it unlikely that uneconomic&#13;
investments would be programmed. The technical assistance called for in the project will&#13;
improve the likelihood of sound work supervision by the regional offices of DRCR. The&#13;
mid-term review will provide an opportunity to detect any weaknesses in execution that&#13;
could compromise the integrity of the objectives of this component of the project.&#13;
D. NETWORK MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.19 Investment under study. DRCR recently undertook a full reassessment of its&#13;
equipment needs based on foreseeable plans. Several conclusions emerged: (a) the&#13;
priority recently assigned to supporting rural development by improving road access&#13;
means having available equipment that is suited to use in demanding terrain; (b) the&#13;
major obstacles to mobility in rural areas during the winter, which lasts six months&#13;
(about 1,300 km of mountain roads are exposed), are snowfalls (30 cm in 24 hours is&#13;
not unusual) and road wash-outs caused by rain on unsurfaced roads; (c) the fleet of&#13;
equipment available, comprising 942 personnel transportation units and 892 units for&#13;
work by force account, is obsolete (averaging 10 and 12 years old, respectively),&#13;
increasing operating costs and down time as a result of more frequent breakdowns and&#13;
difficulties with the supply of spare parts; (d) work on force account should take a&#13;
relatively smaller share, at least for programmable and easily measurable work.&#13;
Accordingly, equipment should be replaced selectively, giving first priority to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Economic Justification                                                      57&#13;
transportation equipment needed by teams performing studies and monitoring work under&#13;
way, as well as equipment to be used in improving access. Two types of equipment will&#13;
be financed by the project: all-terrain utility vehicles and snow removal equipment.&#13;
4.20 Benefits. The benefits analysis focuses on reducing in operating costs by&#13;
substituting new equipment for old equipment, after having verified that the available&#13;
fleet after investment is the right size in relation to needs. For utility vehicles, studies&#13;
have shown that the total fleet of 203 all-terrain vehicles could be reduced to 109. Given&#13;
the need for renewal, plans call for purchasing 74 units, of which 34 would be financed&#13;
under the Third African Development Bank Project. The size of the fleet proposed is&#13;
justified by the launching of the national program to build 10,000 km of rural roads in&#13;
seven years, and the needs of 80 subdivisions of the DPTP. The removal equipment&#13;
includes 13 fixed-blade snowplows and 6 snow blowers to keep the fleet at its optimum&#13;
size. This equipment is used mostly on the trunk roads, where road closing not only cut&#13;
off populations in remote areas but also the regions in the interior which are linked by&#13;
these roads. Between the winter of 1991 and the winter of 1994 there were an average&#13;
of 150 days of road closures per year and 4 days per road. Renewal is necessary because&#13;
current equipment is between 20-25 years old. Finally, the renewal of the 7 low-bed&#13;
trucks will also increase the mobility and the efficiency of the force account crews&#13;
working on regravelling rural routes and shoulders. Benefits are lower operating and&#13;
maintenance costs and increased productivity. Operating costs have been estimated on the&#13;
basis of cost accounting data provided by DRCR (for older equipment, they range from&#13;
6% to 8% of purchase price to 15 % to 17% at the end of the period; for new equipment,&#13;
the comparable range is between 1% to 3.5% and 4% to 6.5%). For the scenario without&#13;
the project, the analysis foresees major repairs as being necessary every five years to&#13;
keep the equipment operating. Productivity gains are in direct relation to the high&#13;
availability level for new equipment. Data provided by DRCR show that productivity will&#13;
increase by about 50% for all-terrain vehicles and low-bed trucks, and by about 100%&#13;
for snow removal equipment.&#13;
4.21 Beneficiaries. The public works administration will be the direct beneficiary of&#13;
equipment renewal. In the case of snow removal operations, the costs associated with&#13;
waiting and rerouting to different itineraries are borne by the users of the roads, who will&#13;
therefore benefit from better coverage of snow removal needs.&#13;
4.22 Non-quantified benefits. Strengthening controls on works will foster greater&#13;
cost effectiveness for road budgets. The renewal of snow removal equipment will prevent&#13;
a rapid increase in the breakdown rate of the existing fleet, which would cause delays in&#13;
performing the work and longer periods of road closure. The populations affected are&#13;
important, and the benefits they will receive from improved performance by snow&#13;
removal equipment will outweigh the cost of the investment outlays. The fact that these&#13;
effects are dissimilar makes them difficult to quantify.&#13;

Table 4.1 confirms that the proposed investment is based on a sound economic rationale,&#13;
with an average internal rate of return of 32.5% for the base scenario. The rate falls to&#13;
27.5% if the cost is increased by 10%, and to 24.9% if the breakdown rate is lowered&#13;
by 15%.&#13;
4.24 Risks. Thc primary risk is that equipment will be poorly used. This risk, which&#13;
is already low, will be reduced even further by the development under the project of the&#13;
Regional Directorates, which are responsible for equipment management.&#13;
4.25 Sustainability of the investment. The quality of equipment maintenance is a&#13;
guarantee of its survival. The seven Regional Directorates have each a regional&#13;
workshop. Generally speaking, the shops have qualified staff and operate effectively.&#13;
Modem methods of preventive maintenance are applied. The very age of the equipment&#13;
in use bears witness to the local capacity for maintaining equipment in operating&#13;
condition under difficult circumstances. It could be inferred from this that the risk of&#13;
improper maintenance of the project equipment is low, particularly since the creation of&#13;
the IFEER in 1993. Financed by Japan, the IFEER provides training for DRCR staff,&#13;
especially mechanics and equipment drivers. The professional qualifications required for&#13;
sustainable equipment use will progressively be raised.&#13;

AmmEx 3D2 LETTER OF SECTOR STATIETY&#13;
1.    The transport sector and the road infrastructure sector play an important role in&#13;
the Government's Development Strategy. To this effect, the Government will take the&#13;
necessary measures to improve access to rural areas and to alleviate road and road&#13;
transport constraints to doing business in the private sector. The Government will also&#13;
take the necessary measures to strengthen the institutions in charge of road maintenance,&#13;
management of the road sector and of road safety.&#13;
Road Transport&#13;
2.   In order to promote greater trucking efficiency, essential measures will be taken&#13;
to liberalize the transport market. To this effect the Government will prepare a draft Law&#13;
by December 31, 1995 covering the following measures:&#13;
(a)   Permit unrestricted for-hire operations of trucks weighing eight tons gross&#13;
or less.&#13;
(b)   Abolish the mandatory use of ONT for freight forwarding and implement&#13;
its new mission.&#13;
(c)   Establish trucking tariff freedom.&#13;
(d)   introduce simplified procedures and professional qualification standards for&#13;
access to the trucking industry without any quantitative limits.&#13;
Funding of Road Maintenance&#13;
3.   In reference to the Government's statement on the strengthening of infrastructures,&#13;
high priority will be given to the maintenance of classified roads, by setting up adequate&#13;
fmancing means, in conformity with the existing laws and regulations.&#13;
Road Safety&#13;
4.    By December 31, 1996, the Government will submit to Parliament a draft Law&#13;
aiming at redefining the role of the National Road Accidents Prevention Committee&#13;
(CNPAC) and at giving it a parastatal status to cover in particular the definition of a&#13;
highway safety policy, together with the preparation of corresponding action plans, the&#13;
preparation of reforms in law and regulations and the coordination of actions aimed at&#13;
road unsafety.&#13;
5.    The Govermnent will arrange that CNPAC restructuring will be accompanied by&#13;
the strengthening of its financial means, in particular by earmarking to it 50% of no-&#13;
contest (paid on the spot to the enforcement officer) road enforcement fines.&#13;

            Kingdom of Morocco - Secondary, Tertiary
            and Rural Roads Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Secondary, Tertiary and Rural Roads
            Project will: (a) address core needs of the rural poor by
            improving access to social services and to market; (b)
            accelerate private sector development by reducing regulatory
            constraints in roads transport and by increased resort to
            road works and supervision by contract; (c) develop road
            management expertise in the new regional directories; and
            (d) improve road safety. Project components include: 1)
            improvement of about 1,133km of priority unpaved rural roads
            to all weather gravel standard; constructing 96km of paved
            rural roads; 2) improving about 2,219km of paved branch
            roads (formerly classified in the secondary and tertiary
            networks) by carrying out maintenance backlog resealings,
            structural overlays and/or widening works; 3) improving
            network management and renewal of essential road maintenance
            equipment; and 4) streamlining the road safety organization
            and supporting priority actions.
