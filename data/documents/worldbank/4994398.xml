SUMMARY&#13;
The importance of water supply and sanitation (WSS) for poverty reduction is inadequately&#13;
represented in the development of poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs) in Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
This is especially true of sanitation. This paper provides an assessment of water and sanitation&#13;
coverage in PRSPs in Sub-Saharan Africa through a review of 12 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso,&#13;
Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritania, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and&#13;
Zambia. The paper explores three questions:&#13;
*   What is the nature of the opportunity presented by the PRSP and HIPC initiatives for the WSS&#13;
sector itn Sub-Saharan Africa?&#13;
It is important for the water and sanitation sector to engage in the PRSP process and ensure it&#13;
receives adequate attention in PRSP documentation. This is because PRSPs are potentially&#13;
becoming the tool for implementing sector reforms and for gaining access to development funds&#13;
both through national budgets, and from external sources such as those available under the&#13;
Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and other external assistance tied to the PRSP&#13;
initiative. The initiative can also become an opportunity to improve sector performance and&#13;
increase the prospect of meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set for the sector.&#13;
*   What is the degree of WSS coverage in PRSPs in Sub-Saharan Africa?&#13;
A benchmarking tool is used to assess the level and quality of water and sanitation coverage in&#13;
PRSPs. The tool can promote accountability and self-assessment and point to emerging good&#13;
practice. Four important elements of water and sanitation in PRSPs were measured: water and&#13;
sanitation in poverty diagnostics, sector reform, sector financing, and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
A number of findings arose out of the analysis. First, there is considerable variation in the degree&#13;
of incorporation of water and sanitation into PRSPs. Second, the average score is low, especially&#13;
considering all PRSPs reviewed are full PRSPs. Water and sanitation is mentioned in the PRSPs,&#13;
but in most PRSPs sector issues are not addressed in depth. Third, average score on each element&#13;
assessed is low in the exercise. Fourth, there is considerable improvement from the interim&#13;
PRSPs to the full PRSPs in most countries. Finally, the countries seem to be grouped into two&#13;
clusters in terms of level and quality of coverage. Two countries - Uganda and Mauritania - are&#13;
emerging as the leaders that provide initial good practice examples.&#13;
*  Ho07 can WSS coverage and incorporation into PRSPs be improved?&#13;
The paper discusses three ideas and measures to improve incorporation of the water and&#13;
sanitation sector into PRSP initiatives. First, improved diagnostics and implementation through&#13;
better information and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) systems: sector capacity can be built&#13;
by strengthening information and M&amp;E systems in order to improve diagnostics, planning, and&#13;
sector performance measurement (input-output-outcome). An emphasis on a results-orientated&#13;
(outcome-impact) approach should not imply an exclusive interest in monitoring final results or&#13;
impacts but should also include aspects related implementation, service delivery and value-for-&#13;
money. Second, sector program and financing: the focus in the water and sanitation sector needs&#13;
to shift to converting broad reforms/policy into strategies with costing of medium-term sector&#13;
programs within realistic resource envelopes, including better design of financing mechanisms&#13;
and strategies to leverage non-budgetary resources and to improve donor coordination. Third,&#13;
advocacy and incentives: the inclusion of water and sanitation in PRSP initiatives is both a&#13;
political and a technical process. It is important to develop forceful advocacy tools to build and&#13;
sustain commitment to the sector within poverty reduction strategies. Successful development of&#13;
these ideas will require considerable support to the sector agencies and for sharing of good&#13;
practices. It is also necessary to ensure that the finance and planning ministries and sector donors&#13;
create incentives and opportunities for the sector to engage in the PRSP process. The role of civil&#13;
society is also very important in this process.&#13;

of additional resources from both governments&#13;
and donors.                                        Currently, 19 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have&#13;
completed full PRSPs, and nine have completed&#13;
One of the main goals of the PRSP is to provide a  interim PRSPs. In this review, 12 countries are&#13;

PRSP secures national spending on priority sectors  sanitation in Sub-Saharan African PRSPs (WSP-AF&#13;
through a medium-term expenditure framework        2002). All countries in the survey have presented&#13;
(MTEF), which links the PRSP to the planning and   full PRSPs.  Several have  initiated  public&#13;
budget cycle in each country. PRSPs also secure    expenditure reviews, MTEFs, and other public&#13;
donor contributions in support of priority sectors  sector management reforms. In our sample,&#13;
by strengthening links between poverty reduction,  Uganda and Burkina Faso seem to be well ahead in&#13;
debt relief under the HIPC initiative, and World  the process in terms of implementation and&#13;
Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF)         financial arrangements. Both receive support for&#13;
concessionary lending. The PRSP initiative aims to  priority expenditure through poverty reduction&#13;

countries and donors, and provides a broad&#13;
framework for all external assistance (see box 1).&#13;
Water and sanitation in PRSPs&#13;
Despite the fact that water and sanitation are&#13;
consistently among the top three or four priorities&#13;
of the poor in participatory poverty assessments&#13;
(PPAs) in most countries in this region, the sector&#13;
has not been effectively incorporated into PRSPs,&#13;
with the possible exception of Uganda and&#13;
Mauritania. Sectors such as education and health&#13;
are likely to have received more attention.&#13;
The lack of water and sanitation coverage in PRSPs&#13;
is a disadvantage to the sector. Full water and&#13;
sanitation sector incorporation into the PRSPs&#13;
would give the sector a stronger position when                                   ,&#13;

Box 1. The New Global Initiatives for Poverty Reduction: HIPC and PRSP&#13;
The HIPC initiative. New approaches to poverty reduction developed during the last decade are reflected in two new&#13;
global initiatives: the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)&#13;
initiatives. The World Bank and the Intemational Monetary Fund (IMF) launched the HIPC initiative in 1996 to create&#13;
a framework for all creditors to provide debt relief to the world's poorest and most heavily indebted countries,&#13;
thereby reducing the constraint on economic growth and poverty reduction imposed by the debt build-up in these&#13;
countries.&#13;
The HIPC initiative frees up substantial amounts of public resources. Recipient countries are expected to use these&#13;
HIPC savings as additional resources to reduce poverty within the framework of country-owned PRSPs. Debt relief&#13;
aims to help countries to achieve sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty by cutting their debts to&#13;
sustainable levels. HIPC assistance is conditional on reforms taking place in recipient countries. The original HIPC&#13;
initiative (HIPC-I) was revised in 1999 to become the enhanced HIPC initiative (HIPC-II), which aims to ensure&#13;
deeper, broader, faster relief, and a stronger link between debt relief and poverty reduction.&#13;
The PRSP initiative. In 1999 the Boards of the World Bank and the IMF endorsed the PRSP initiative to reduce poverty&#13;
in low-income countries through nationally owned poverty reduction strategies. Since then HIPC debt relief&#13;
assistance requires countries to formulate a PRSP and to implement the poverty reduction strategy for one year in&#13;
order to attain the completion point. Five core principles were expected to underlie the development and&#13;
implementation of these poverty strategies:&#13;
*   Country ownership and commitment&#13;
*   Results orientation in policy, planning, and budget allocations&#13;
*   Comprehensive perspective for different dimensions of poverty&#13;
*   Partnership orientation: consultation with all stakeholders in preparation of poverty strategies&#13;
*   Medium- to long-term perspective for strategies and extemal commitments&#13;
Instead of accepting prescribed policies, the governments of developing countries are expected to develop effective&#13;
poverty reduction strategies through broad stakeholder consultations. For each country, the strategies are to be drawn&#13;
up in a PRSP. The development of these strategy papers also provides a framework for strengthening the impact of&#13;
public spending on poverty and promoting progress towards the MDGs. Each PRSP will be country driven, and there&#13;
is no blueprint for a PRSP. But there are three key steps to consider:&#13;
*   Using multidimensional poverty diagnostics to understand the features and the determining factors of poverty&#13;
*   Choosing macroeconomic and sector programs, and public actions that have the greatest impact on poverty&#13;
&#149;   Monitoring programs for chosen poverty reduction outcomes and adjusting policy and programs accordingly&#13;
The PRSP is intended to strengthen links between poverty reduction, debt relief under the HIPC initiative, and World&#13;
Bank and IMF concessional lending (table 1). The PRSP is also expected to provide a broad framework for all external&#13;
assistance beyond the operations of the Bank and the IMF. To ensure strategic expenditure spending, the PRSPs need&#13;
to be linked to a three-year MTEF where they exist. Whereas in the past budgeting was incremental and ministries&#13;
were allocated funds according to what they spent the previous year, the goal now is to have allocations made&#13;
according to strategic priorities. Priorities are set into action through the MTEF and annual budget allocations.&#13;

Moving towards comprehensive sector performance assessment in Uganda. The joint sector review in 2001 questioned&#13;
whether additional investments in the water sector were generating enough value for the money. An analysis&#13;
undertaken by the Ministry of Finance showed that while total flow of resources to the sector tripled from 44.9&#13;
billion Uganda shillings in 1997/98 to 133.9 billion shillings in 2000/01, output showed a decline. Preliminary&#13;
assessment suggested that the costs required to increase rural safe water coverage by 1 percent had tripled over&#13;
the previous four fiscal years. The water sector has initiated detailed value-for-money and expenditure tracking&#13;
studies in response, and a management information system is being set up with the sector ministry. In the recent&#13;
joint sector review for 2003 design and implementation of a better performance assessment system has been&#13;
accorded high priority.&#13;
Equity of distribution and sustainability snapshot indicators for water points in Malawi. WaterAid (Malawi) has&#13;
developed simple tools to ensure that water sanitation investments are implemented in an equitable and&#13;
sustainable manner. Population distribution is mapped in relation to the location of water points at district level&#13;
in order to facilitate more equitable investment decisions. The sustainability of water services was assessed&#13;
through a simple set of questions designed to ascertain a community's access to the funds, skills, spare parts, and&#13;
equipment necessary to carry out repairs to the water point. The indicators have proved useful for specific&#13;
projects and attempts are being made to apply them at national level.&#13;
Assessing national surveysfor impact monitoring in Tanzania. In Tanzania a study was carried out to analyze sector&#13;
trends using information from existing national household surveys. A detailed analysis of appropriate impact&#13;
indicators was also made. This analysis was used to reflect on the usefulness of national surveys and ways to&#13;
improve the impact indicators. The study recommended to:&#13;
*   Design comparable formats and questions applicable to WSS issues across surveys and censuses, because the&#13;
definition of safe water used in the Tanzanian PRSP is not directly measured by any of the national surveys&#13;
*   Differentiate between protected and unprotected water sources so that access to improved water sources can&#13;
be measured and adopt the indicator "time taken to fetch water", because the surveys were not consistent in&#13;
their measurement of time and distance to water and none of them measure the national water policy target&#13;
of "within 400 meters"&#13;
*   Reassess the sanitation situation in Tanzania, because sanitation data are not comparable across the national&#13;
surveys in the study&#13;
*   Ensure that improved WSS data are collected by the census and analyzed at district level&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Box 5. Defining Characteristics of a Sector-wide Approach (SWAP)&#13;
Generically defined, a SWAP means that all significant funding for the sector supports a single policy and&#13;
expenditure program under government leadership. The mechanism relies on the following principles:&#13;
*   Country ownership. The govemment takes the lead in defining a policy framework and expenditure program for&#13;
the sector and invites broad-based participation. This framework typically also includes a medium-term (three&#13;
to five years) strategy of specific interventions.&#13;
*   Donor coordination. Donors pledge to support the government's strategy and coordinate all significant funding&#13;
for the sector to finance the agreed policy and expenditure program.&#13;
*   Transition to sector budget support. The aim of the SWAP is to gradually reach a stage where as much as possible&#13;
of the external assistance is channeled through government budgets.&#13;
*   Harmonized procedures. Donors establish common planning, implementation, disbursement, reporting, and&#13;
accounting arrangements to reduce the administrative burden on all parties: the host government, the sector,&#13;
and donors.&#13;
*   Results-based management. SWAPs are planned and reviewed on the basis of their results. Monitoring and&#13;
evaluation systems need particular attention.&#13;

strengthening country and sector capacity as well as&#13;
an adjustment in donor priority.&#13;
Box 6. Difficulties in Using a SWAP for Water and Sanitation&#13;
Use of a SWAP in water and sanitation is likely to be affected by a number of sector characteristics. These include:&#13;
*   A wide array of service providers exists in many countries, ranging from national to local levels, and&#13;
comprising governments, public utilities, community-based organizations, NGOs, and private operators, which&#13;
makes it difficult to clearly identify and coordinate overall sector targets and the priorities of the sector&#13;
program. For example, in Ethiopia rural water supply services are largely provided by village-level community-&#13;
based organizations, and in most countries small private providers commonly provide services in urban&#13;
informal settlements.&#13;
*   In most countries implementation of institutional reforms generally requires transition arrangements&#13;
particularly linked to decentralization and the development of regulatory arrangements.&#13;
*   The mandate for sanitation is often fragmented across several ministries and local governments. This makes it&#13;
difficult to adopt a SWAP because there is no clear lead ministry that can champion the cause of sanitation.&#13;
*   Considerable off-budget resources make it difficult use a SWAP in the sector. Studies in Kenya and Ethiopia, for&#13;
example, suggest that off-budget funding through NGOs constitutes about 20 percent of total sector&#13;
expenditure.'&#13;
*   Weak sector information and monitoring systems make it difficult to track expenditures and easily link inputs&#13;
to outputs and outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
*   There  is   an   emerging   trend   towards            resources by service providers through user&#13;
decentralization in many countries, whereby            charges, operational surpluses, and mobilization&#13;

service delivery is being devolved to local            the use of public resources should provide&#13;

areas, on the other hand, demand-responsive&#13;
approaches imply a shift from centralized&#13;
planning and the implementation of capital&#13;
investments by national ministries or utilities to&#13;
investments in response to demand from local&#13;
authorities  and  local  utilities.  In  such&#13;

Box 7. Countrywide and Sectorwide Assessment of Water and Sanitation Resource Flows&#13;
Previous studies have led to a better understanding of the role of sector finance in improved incorporation of&#13;
water and sanitation into PRSPs. To support this, a framework for the countrywide and sectorwide assessment of&#13;
the water and sanitation sector financial resource flows has been developed using the tools of institutional and&#13;
financial mapping. Institutional mapping help identify the main water service providers and financial mapping&#13;
traces the sources and channels of funds used. A resource flows matrix is developed for all service providers. This&#13;
approach also provides parameters to carry out regional comparisons. The matrix includes (a) water service&#13;
providers - national government department or utility, local government or utility, private providers or&#13;
community-based providers; (b) channels of finance - national budgets, local budgets, special funds, internal&#13;
generation of resources, off-budget routes (mainly through NGOs), and direct expenditure by households or&#13;
communities; and (c) sources of funds - the government's own resources or HIPC debt relief, user charges,&#13;
accumulated internal surplus through operations, external donors, household savings, and domestic market&#13;
borrowing. An interesting parallel for this approach exists in the health sector, where a system of national health&#13;
accounts has been used in several different countries over the past decade (WHO 2003).&#13;
Preliminary application of this approach has been carried out in Kenya, Ethiopia, and South Africa, and is being&#13;
extended to other countries. Some preliminary findings include:&#13;
*   Sector finance in most countries is dominated by public budgetary allocations, with a share of about 50 to 60&#13;
percent. However, a significant share is from local authority budgets, though there is considerable variation&#13;
across countries in this regard.&#13;
*   Internal generation of resources by service providers is an important source at around 20 to 30 percent in&#13;
Ethiopia and Kenya. In South Africa 25 percent of total capital expenditure by municipalities is through&#13;
market borrowing. Except in South Africa, internal generation does not contribute significantly to&#13;
development expenditure.&#13;
*   User charges are important and contribute to about 39 percent of total resource mobilization in Kenya.&#13;
*   In both Kenya and Ethiopia, the share of off-budget funding - mainly by donors through NGOs - is&#13;
estimated to be about 20 percent. In the case of Kenya, this is nearly 70 percent of total donor assistance.&#13;
South African experience suggests that, when coordinating off-budget resources, caution is necessary to&#13;
ensure that the community and NGO roles often supported through these funds are not affected adversely in&#13;
the process of channeling all funds through the government.&#13;
*   Water and sanitation receives a lower share of budgetary resources than other sectors such as health and&#13;
education, despite the fact that a large proportion is met through user charges. The shares of water and&#13;
sanitation expenditure in the GDPs of Kenya, Ethiopia, and Uganda range from 0.5 to 1 percent, as against 2&#13;
to 8 percent for health and education.&#13;
Analysis of overall sector finance and resource flows is important for strengthening the incorporation of water&#13;
and sanitation into PRSPs, as it helps to develop a countrywide perspective. It also provides a base for identifying&#13;
financing mechanisms for a countrywide water and sanitation sector program.&#13;
Sources: Based on WSP-AF 2003 and ongoing work on WSS resource flows at WSP-AF.&#13;
Another important aspect of water and sanitation      approach. The pooling of donor resources can yield&#13;
financing within a sector program is the need to     several benefits (World Bank 2002). It can:&#13;
increasingly channel donor support for investments&#13;
through national budgetary systems. While general     *  Enable   borrowers  to  institute  a  single&#13;

            The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
            process was initiated in the late 1990s and is still
            evolving with varying experiences across countries.
            Increasingly, PRSPs and related processes are becoming
            important in the country-owned determination of the policy
            and expenditure framework for poverty reduction.  It is
            important for all sectors, including the water and
            sanitation sector, to participate in the PRSP process and
            receive adequate attention in PRSP documentation.  PRSPs are
            becoming the tool for implementing sector reforms and the
            mobilization of additional resources from both governments
            and donors.  The importance of water supply and sanitation
            (WSS ) for poverty reduction is inadequately represented in
            the development of PRSPs  in Sub-Saharan Africa.  This is
            especially true of sanitation.  This paper provides an
            assessment of water and sanitation coverage in PRSPs in
            Sub-Saharan Africa through a review of 12 countries:  Benin,
            Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritania,
            Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.
            This paper explores three questions: (i) What is the nature
            of the opportunity presented by the PRSP and HIPC
            initiatives for the WSS sector in Sub-Saharan Africa?  (ii)
            What is the degree of WSS coverage in PRSPs in Sub-Saharan
            Africa?  (iii) How can WSS coverage and incorporation into
            PRSPs be improved?
