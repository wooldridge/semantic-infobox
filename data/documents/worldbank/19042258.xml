   Ongoing consultations were undertaken in the development of this roadmap. A Community of Practice was established in 2012 to&#13;
   engage Bank staff across regional and network VPUs. This communityâ&#128;&#148;the Rangersâ&#128;&#148;has been instrumental in providing input and&#13;
   feedback on this roadmap, culminating in a full consultation on the first draft during SDN Week in March 2013. Their contributions are&#13;
   gratefully acknowledged. The Roadmap was prepared under the guidance of the Environment Sector Board, with special thanks to Sari&#13;
   Soderstrom and Magda Lovei.&#13;
&#13;
   Consultations in the context of the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s role in the ICCWC partnership also helped inform the roadmap. Other people, representing a&#13;
   broad range of stakeholders, including civil society, academia, the private sector, and other development partners, were also consulted&#13;
   in the formulation of this roadmap.&#13;
&#13;
   The Roadmap was prepared by a team comprising Valerie Hickey, Bill Magrath, Julian Lee, Klas Sander, and Marilyne Goncalves; with&#13;
   support from Elisabeth Mealey, Jim Cantrell, Sara Thompson, and Juliette Guantai.&#13;

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This roadmap for environmental and natural resources law enforcement (ENRLE) sets forth a course of action for the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s ENRLE Community of Practice for FY2013â&#128;&#147;15. It outlines for senior management a strategy to mobilize and strengthen the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s engagement in the fight against environmental and natural resource crime, an issue that has significant detrimental effects on the&#13;
economic, social, political, and environmental stability of our client countries. The roadmap also serves as a mobilizing tool for staff and&#13;
management in regional departments to demonstrate the importance of ENRLE and to outline the menu of solutions that the Community&#13;
of Practice (COP) can offer to strengthen our clientsâ&#128;&#153; fight against environmental and natural resource crime.&#13;
&#13;
Recent spikes in poaching, in illegal logging, and in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing have amplified the&#13;
already urgent need for action. These crimes increase poverty, shrink prosperity, and magnify social and political tensions that under-&#13;
mine healthy communities and strong economies. Investment returns in wise environmental and natural resource law enforcement can&#13;
be high.&#13;
&#13;
Criminal activities that affect the environment and natural resources are on the increase and pose an increasingly seri-&#13;
ous threat to development. Data and analyses reviewed by the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Community of Practice on ENRLE begin to show the&#13;
magnitude of illegal logging, poaching of wildlife, trade in endangered species, wildland arson, criminal toxic releases, and other&#13;
environment and natural resourceâ&#128;&#147;related crimes. They also show the diversity of the criminal threat, ranging from small-scale, arti-&#13;
sanal crime that arises from poverty and inequities to growing problems of organized transnational criminal networks and enterprises&#13;
using corruption, money laundering, technology, and other sophisticated methods to exploit persistent weaknesses in resource man-&#13;
agement and law enforcement. All World Bank client countries suffer from these crimes and are underserved by existing international&#13;
law enforcement institutions and available mechanisms for support, capacity building, and operational cooperation. Vulnerability to&#13;
environment crimes is often deepened by overarching problems of governance, corruption, and weaknesses in accountability at the&#13;
national level.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and natural resource crime is common, but in many countries it is rarely prosecuted. The very elements that make&#13;
these crimes possibleâ&#128;&#148;that natural capital is undervalued, seldom properly guarded, and often has unclear or contested ownershipâ&#128;&#148;also&#13;
compromise prosecution.&#13;
&#13;
This Roadmap FY2013â&#128;&#147;15 builds on recently scaled-up support for ENRLE1 that includes project commitments on the order of&#13;
$50â&#128;&#147;60 million per year. Along with investments, the Bank supports advisory and analytic work and leadership in regional and interna-&#13;
tional processes and dialogue. While the Bank is not a law enforcement agency, its established programs to support natural resource and&#13;
environmental management and to safeguard global public goods, its commitment to strengthening good governance and to fighting&#13;
&#13;

         corruption, and its partnerships with key law enforcement agencies such as Interpol and Europol give it an opportunity and responsibility&#13;
         to do more.&#13;
&#13;
         This report discusses how the World Bank Group (WBG) will mobilize to work better on ENRLE. Recognizing the evolving global&#13;
         context, a new and fully mobilized Community of Practice will put more emphasis on building a constituency within the WBG to work on&#13;
         the range of ENRLE issues, on building the capacity of WBG staff to provide investment and technical assistance on ENRLE, on strengthening&#13;
         analytical work to develop a pipeline of ENRLE investments, and on fostering demand among clients for Bank investment in ENRLE.&#13;

Chapter 1	                THE EVOLUTION OF A ROADMAP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has historically tended to avoid direct                                             the proceeds of crime, and tax evasionâ&#128;&#148;affect governance&#13;
involvement in criminal justice matters. Interestingly, and im-                                    and development outcomes across the developing world&#13;
portantly, this has led the Bank to support innovations in natural                                 (World Bank 2011a). If they are to be effective, country-level efforts&#13;
resource policy, addressing problems in a way that is not labeled                                  to tackle these threats have to be backed by international coopera-&#13;
law enforcement. The most important example of this is social and                                  tion and collective action. The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s global governance and&#13;

and tenure reform created a new paradigm for resource policy that                                  whether it is protecting the global commons, safeguarding the&#13;

In the past several years the Bank began to reconsider its&#13;
engagement with issues of corruption and criminal jus-                                             A range of global threats can significantly impede efforts to&#13;

resource regimes and the strong economies that depend on                                           ruption. Criminals take advantage of statesâ&#128;&#153; weakness and inability&#13;

            This roadmap for environmental and
            natural resources law enforcement (ENRLE) sets forth a
            course of action for the World Bank's ENRLE community
            of practice for FY2013-15. It outlines for senior management
            a strategy to mobilize and strengthen the Bank's
            engagement in the fight against environmental and natural
            resource crime. The roadmap also serves as a mobilizing tool
            for staff and management in regional departments to
            demonstrate the importance of ENRLE and to outline the menu
            of solutions that the community of practice (COP) can offer
            to strengthen clients' fight against environmental and
            natural resource crime. Recent spikes in poaching, in
            illegal logging, and in illegal, unreported, and unregulated
            (IUU) fishing have amplified the already urgent need for
            action. These crimes increase poverty, shrink prosperity,
            and magnify social and political tensions that undermine
            healthy communities and strong economies. Investment returns
            in wise environmental and natural resource law enforcement
            can be high. Criminal activities that affect the environment
            and natural resources are on the increase and pose an
            increasingly serious threat to development. Environmental
            and natural resource crime is common, but in many countries
            it is rarely prosecuted. This report discusses how the World
            Bank Group (WBG) will mobilize to work better on ENRLE.
            Recognizing the evolving global context, a new and fully
            mobilized community of practice will put more emphasis on
            building a constituency within the WBG to work on the range
            of ENRLE issues, on building the capacity of WBG staff to
            provide investment and technical assistance on ENRLE, on
            strengthening analytical work to develop a pipeline of ENRLE
            investments, and on fostering demand among clients for Bank
            investment in ENRLE.
