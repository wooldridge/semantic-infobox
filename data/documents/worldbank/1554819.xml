ABSTRACT&#13;
Trade patterns are analyzed for a panel of fifty developing&#13;
countries over the period 1970-81.    The results suggest that shares of&#13;
both non-oil imports and exports declined with rising GNP per capita&#13;
across   the  sample,  contrary   to  both  historical   and  contemporary&#13;
experience in advanced countries. Countries seem to be most successful&#13;
in import substitution of textiles, shoes, and clothing products.&#13;
Relatively fast-growing countries have higher import and lower export&#13;
shares in GDP than slow growers.    They have easier access to sources of&#13;
finance for larger non-oil trade gaps and turn part of the proceeds into&#13;
faster growth.   This in turn is reflected in some success in shifting&#13;
their specialization toward sophisticated consumer goods and capital&#13;
goods.&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
En este trabajo se analizan las caracteristicas del comercio de un&#13;
conjunto de 50 paises en desarrollo durante el periodo de 1970-81. Los resulta-&#13;
dos indican que la proporci6n tanto de importaciones como de exportaciones, dis-&#13;
tintas del petr6leo, disminuy6 a medida que se elevaba el producto nacional&#13;
bruto (PNB) per capita en toda la muestra, contrariamente a la experiencia his-&#13;
t6rica y contemporanea en los paises avanzados. Los paises parecen obtener los&#13;
mejores resultados en la sustituci6n de importaciones de textiles, calzado y&#13;
prendas de vestir. Los paises de crecimiento relativamente rapido muestran&#13;
mayor proporci6n de importaciones y menor proporci6n de exportaciones en el pro-&#13;
ducto interno bruto (PIB) que los de crecimiento lento. Tienen acceso mas facil&#13;
a las fuentes de financiamiento para hacer frente a deficit comerciales de mayor&#13;
volumen y no relacionados con el petr6leo, y utilizan parte de los fondos para&#13;
lograr un crecimiento mas acelerado. Esto a su vez se refleja en el logro de&#13;
algunos buenos resultados en cuanto a desplazar su especializaci6n hacia la&#13;
manufactura de bienes de consumo mAs refinados y bienes de capital.&#13;

Ce document analyse la physionomie des echanges pour un&#13;
echantillon de cinquante pays en d6veloppement pendant la p6riode allant&#13;
de 1970 A 1981. Les resultats indiquent que les parts des importations et&#13;
des exportations de produits non petroliers ont diminue A mesure que le&#13;
PNB par habitant augmentait dans tous les pays de l1'chantillon,&#13;
contrairement aux tendances observ6es dans le passe et plus r6cemment dans&#13;
les pays economiquement avanc6s. Pour les pays etudies, le remplacement&#13;
des importations de textiles, de chaussures et de vetements par des&#13;
produits locaux semblent avoir donn6 de particulierement bons resultats.&#13;
Dans les pays A croissance relativement rapide, la part des importations&#13;
et la part des exportations dans le PIB sont respectivement plus&#13;
importantes et moins importantes que dans les pays A croissance lente.&#13;
Les premiers ont plus facilement acces aux sources de financement pour&#13;
combler des d6ficits commerciaux (produits autres que le petrole) plus&#13;
6lev6s et utilisent une partie des fonds pour acc6lerer encore leur&#13;
croissance, ce qui leur permet dans une certaine mesure de se specialiser&#13;
dans la production de biens de consommation et d'6quipement plus&#13;
sophistiques.&#13;

1.   Introduction&#13;
Countries at similar levels of income and of similar size have&#13;
long been known to share similar patterns of economic structure and&#13;
resource allocation -- this is the central message of the well-known&#13;
studies of Kuznets, Chenery, and others. 1/     There is little reason to&#13;
doubt that this finding should apply to foreign trade as well. However,&#13;
as far as we know, the relevant tests have not been run at a&#13;
disaggregated level, in particular for developing countries.&#13;
One reason why Chenery-Kuznets "patterns" studies have not been&#13;
done for trade is simple lack of data. Thanks to the United Nations and&#13;
the World Bank, this gap has now been filled. 2/       A more fundamental&#13;
reason, perhaps, is that theorists have not concentrated their attention&#13;
until recently on per capita income and population as significant&#13;
determinants of trade.     As discussed by Frances Stewart (1982) in a&#13;
useful survey paper, "old" theories like Heckscher-Ohlin focus on factor&#13;
endowments and by extension the importance of natural resources and the&#13;
national reserve of skills in determining trade patterns; "middle-aged"&#13;
models like the product cycle stress aspects of technology.         Recent&#13;
work by Havrylyshyn (1983) has provided empirical evidence to account&#13;
for differences in the direction of developing country trade while&#13;
Balassa (1983) has examined the effects of policies on trade between&#13;
developed and developing countries.    Only the middle-aged Linder (1961)&#13;
theory and newer proposals by Paul Krugman (1980), Kevin Lancaster&#13;
(1980) and others explicitly bring in market size and income-related&#13;
tastes. As we will see shortly, such considerations go some way toward&#13;
- 1 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
explaining trade patterns, especially for imports.      Inevitably various&#13;
institutional and political factors will play a significant role in many&#13;
instances at the individual country level and this will not be captured&#13;
in an analysis such as this.&#13;
In this paper, we study the relationship between shares of&#13;
seven categories of imports and exports in GDP and the logs of GNP per&#13;
capita and population. The regressions take the form&#13;
Trade share = a + b LNGNPPC + c LNPOP.                        (1)&#13;
They are estimated for a panel of 50 developing countries (with GNP per&#13;
capita in 1981 dollars ranging from $140 to $5640) over the period 1970-&#13;
81.   A listing of the countries appears in Table Al in the appendix.&#13;
The seven trade categories are:&#13;
1.   Agricultural food products&#13;
2.   Agricultural non-food products&#13;
3.   Metals, minerals, and fertilizer&#13;
4.   Intermediate manufacturing&#13;
5.   Textiles, shoes, and clothing&#13;
6.   Other consumer goods&#13;
7.   Capital goods&#13;
Note that we do not deal with trade in petroleum products, because of&#13;
their volatility   over the 1970s.     Further detail   on the categories&#13;
appears in Table A2 in the appendix.&#13;
Equation (1) is the standard form adopted by Chenery and&#13;
Syrquin (1975) and many other studies, and        we use    it   for   that&#13;
reason. 3/   For an equation of this form, the elasticity of the trade&#13;
share with respect to per capita GNP can be calculated as the ratio of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
the estimated coefficient b to the value of the share at the sample&#13;
mean.    The partial   elasticity  of the trade share with     respect to&#13;
population (holding per capita GNP constant) is the ratio of the&#13;
estimated coefficient c to the share at the sample mean.     One plus the&#13;
elasticity with respect to per capita GNP gives an approximation to the&#13;
elasticity of the level of trade with respect to per capita GNP.&#13;
In what follows, we first discuss in section 1 the results from&#13;
estimating equation (1) for the full sample.      Thereafter, sections 2&#13;
through 5 take up four splits of the sample, which are used to&#13;
illustrate differentials between trade patterns over time and place.&#13;
The splits are:&#13;
1.   Time   period.     Three  periods   --   1970/73,  1974/77,&#13;
1978/81.   These correspond to before and after the first&#13;
oil shock and after the second shock.&#13;
2.   Population size.  Two divisions by country with population&#13;
above or below 20 million in 1981.&#13;
3.   GDP growth 1970/81.    Two divisions determined by whether&#13;
performance is above or below the growth rate norm for&#13;
that period.   The norm was obtained by regressing log GDP&#13;
growth rate on log of GNP per capita in 1981.&#13;
4.   Regional and economic.    The sample countries are divided&#13;
into three mutually exclusive regions:     America, 4/ and&#13;
the remainder by low and high income categories.&#13;
The detailed classification for each of the splits is given in the&#13;
appendix. Finally, conclusions appear in section 6.&#13;

2.   Results from the Pooled Sample&#13;
Table 1 presents estimated regression coefficients for GDP shares&#13;
of imports and exports in the seven categories, as well as their total&#13;
(from (1) the coefficients in equations for disaggregated shares sum to&#13;
the  coefficients   for  the  overall  share).     Note  first  that  most&#13;
coefficients are well-determined with high t-values.       In effect, per&#13;
capita income and population are seen to be independent and significant&#13;
determinants of patterns of trade.    However, the relatively low   values&#13;
of R2 (essentially for the export regressions) show that the two&#13;
variables fall well short of determining trade completely.&#13;
Some categories are more uniform across countries than others.&#13;
On the import side, groups of products closer to the consumer (textiles,&#13;
other consumer goods, and food agriculture) are better explained than&#13;
groups traded among producers (non-food agriculture, metals, minerals&#13;
and fertilizers, and capital goods). Intermediate manufactures occupy a&#13;
position somewhere in the middle on this scale, which overall suggests&#13;
that import patterns are strongly influenced by a country's history of&#13;
industrial growth, and the particular structure of its inter-industry&#13;
relationships.   Among exports, the best explained categories are food&#13;
agriculture, and "sophisticated" products near the end of the list. One&#13;
can hypothesize that both resource availabilities and characteristics of&#13;
partner countries will influence export patterns, and these variables&#13;
are  excluded   from  the  analysis.       The  usual   patterns-of-growth&#13;
hypothesis that uniform evolution of tastes and technology explains&#13;
structural  shifts  as the economy    develops  applies more directly   to&#13;
imports, as the equations show.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
Second,  non-oil  trade  shares  decline with   increases  in per&#13;
capita GDP, when the effects of population as a proxy for market size&#13;
are taken into account.   However, since equation     (1) can be rewritten&#13;
as&#13;
Trade share = a + (b - c) LNGNPPC + c LNGNP,              (2)&#13;
the results in Table 1 can also be used to test the relationship of&#13;
trade to.per capita GNP when total GNP is used to correct for market&#13;
size.   It is easy to see from Table 1 that in this case, the share of&#13;
trade is positively related to per capita GNP, consistent with findings&#13;
of   Kuznets   (1964)  for   a   cross-section   dominated   by  developed&#13;
countries.   Chenery and Syrquin (1975) also find a positive association&#13;
between per capita GNP and trade share in a sample including countries&#13;
at all income levels, using population to take account of size.&#13;
There is no clear consensus in the literature about whether to&#13;
use total GNP or population to capture size effects.      Nonetheless, our&#13;
finding that trade is negatively associated with country size under the&#13;
population correction for only developing countries is consistent with&#13;
the stylized facts. For example, Barker (1977) worked out the following&#13;
real' annual growth rates for the period 1950-70:&#13;
GDP growth           Import growth&#13;
rate (M)               (rate (%)&#13;
Developed countries         4.5                    7.9&#13;
Developing countries        4.9                    5.0&#13;
The intriguing question that Barker's and our results pose is&#13;
whether or not trade can grow substantially faster than income for the&#13;
developing countries in the next decades, as it did for industrialized&#13;
countries throughout the 19th century and after World War II.      If not,&#13;
the search may be on for a new engine of growth.     Proponents of South-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
South trade such as Amsden (1983) suggest that it may fill the role of&#13;
the missing motor.&#13;
Third, the gap between total imports and total exports (again&#13;
non-oil) as share of GDP rises with per capita income.        This can be&#13;
seen more clearly in Figure 1 where projected shares for the different&#13;
trade categories are "stacked" on each other across income levels to&#13;
give the total shares.     At a per capita GNP of about $150 the gap&#13;
between imports and exports is four percent; it widens to 6.5 percent at&#13;
$3000.   On average, higher income developing countries are able to&#13;
obtain foreign resources to support much higher trade gaps than are&#13;
feasible for poor countries.&#13;
Fourth, elasticities of import and export levels and shares with&#13;
respect to per capita GNP and population are given in Table 2.        The&#13;
elasticity of the total import share of GDP with respect to GNP per&#13;
capita is estimated at -0.07, while the partial elasticity with respect&#13;
to population is -0.26. The elasticity of imports (constant U.S.$) with&#13;
respect to GNP per capita is 0.93 for the period 1970-81.       Since the&#13;
average annual growth rate of GNP per capita was around three percent&#13;
for the sample panel in the period 1970-81 this elasticity estimate&#13;
implies that their imports (non-oil) grew at around 2.8 percent per&#13;
annum.   During this period the GNP per capita for the indutrialized&#13;
countries grew at about two percent per annum.        The imports of the&#13;
sample panel served as a source of demand growth for the industrialized&#13;
countries.&#13;
Turning to results for the disaggregated trade categories, note&#13;
first from Figure 1 that much of the decline in total trade shares is&#13;
explained by falling exports (especially) and imports of agricultural&#13;

products  as   per  capita  GNP   goes  up.    Such   a  shift  away  from&#13;
specialization in primary products was emphasized by Chenery and Syrquin&#13;
(1975).   The fall   in food imports is consistent with Engel 's Law.&#13;
However, from Table 2 the implied elasticity of the level of food&#13;
imports with respect to income is 0.83. The typical range of values for&#13;
household Engel elasticities is 0.2 to 0.5.       The difference suggests&#13;
that at given population levels imported foods increase their share in&#13;
the   domestic  food  market   as  income   grows,  despite   some  import&#13;
substitution.&#13;
The only import shares which rise with per capita GNP are non-&#13;
food agriculture (group 2) and metals, minerals, and fertilizers (group&#13;
3).     Increasing  intermediate   demands  to  support   a  more  complex&#13;
industrial structure may underlie these results; the same explanation&#13;
applies for the small negative value of -0.06 for the elasticity of&#13;
intermediate manufactures (group 4) with respect to income.      The major&#13;
opportunities for import substitution appear to be in category 5 --&#13;
textiles, shoes, and clothing.     This unsurprising finding shows up in&#13;
the high R2 for the relevant regression, and the elasticity of -0.3 of&#13;
the import share with respect to per capita GNP. Finally, it is clear&#13;
from Figure 1 that for developing countries on average there is little&#13;
import substitution of either more sophisticated consumer goods (group&#13;
6) or capital goods (group 7).&#13;
On the export side, the best-fitting regression aside from food&#13;
agriculture are for categories 6 and 7 -- other consumer goods and&#13;
capital goods.   Both show fairly high elasticities with respect to per&#13;
capita GNP -- a finding discussed further in connection with the sample&#13;
split betwen slow- and fast-growing economies below.&#13;

The last point to note about the equations is that they&#13;
demonstrate the well-known negative effect of market size (as measured&#13;
by population) on trade.      The elasticities for import shares cluster&#13;
around -0.25. There is a narrower range for exports.&#13;
3.   Trade by Time Period&#13;
Now we turn to discussion of several splits of the sample&#13;
panel.   The aim is heuristic -- to suggest how different trade patterns&#13;
may arise in broad categories of countries.         No attempt is made at&#13;
statistical testing, since with a sample of several hundred observations&#13;
the standard Chow test will say that almost any split is "significant"&#13;
by not rejecting the null hypothesis of different coefficients across&#13;
groups.    It should come as no surprise that nations or time periods&#13;
differ; the real question is the economic importance of the differences&#13;
across   relatively   homogenous   groups.     In  large   samples,   simple&#13;
statistical tests do not address this issue.&#13;
Most of the discussion will be carried out diagramatically; the&#13;
relevant coefficient estimates appear in Tables A3 through A18 in the&#13;
appendix.   Figures 2 and 3 show the relationships of import and export&#13;
shares to per capita GNP for the overall sample, and the sub-periods&#13;
1970/73, 1974/77, and 1978/81.     Table 3 gives elasticity estimates for&#13;
total export and import trade.&#13;
This evidence suggests that there were no striking shifts in&#13;
trade  patterns   over  the  tumultuous  1970s.     In general   the  import&#13;
equations are more stable, but even export patterns do not vary&#13;
greatly.   In numerical terms, the average share of non-oil imports in&#13;
GOP increased from 17.6 percent in 1970/73 to 20.5 percent in 1974/77 to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
21.7 percent in 1978/81. The corresponding figure for exports rose from&#13;
14.2 in 1970/73 to 15.4 in 1974/77 but then fell to 13.3 in 1978/81.&#13;
For the 1978/81 period the change indicates an unfavorable shift in&#13;
overall trade balance against the sample countries even when oil is&#13;
excluded.&#13;
Looking at the pattern of elasticities for overall volume of&#13;
trade, one notes that the export elasticity fell from 0.90 to 0.85 by&#13;
the second period and stayed at 0.86 for the third period. On the other&#13;
hand the import elasticity did not fall during the second period and&#13;
only by the third period did it fall to 0.87, suggesting a lagged&#13;
structural adjustment. At disaggregated levels across time there was a&#13;
fall in the export elasticity of non-food agriculture in the second and&#13;
third periods, but a steady increase in the elasticities of exports with&#13;
respect to GNPPC for three categories:    textiles, shoes, and clothing;&#13;
other consumer goods; and capital goods. Lagged export promotion in&#13;
response to the mor eunfavorable external environment may have been&#13;
involved.&#13;
4.   Population Size&#13;
In this split the countries are divided into low and high&#13;
population groups according to whether their population was less than or&#13;
greater than 20 million in 1981.     The low population group has much&#13;
larger trade shares with values for exports averaging 17.4 percent of&#13;
GDP and imports at 24.0 while the corresponding figures for the high&#13;
population countries are 9.35 and 12.8 respectively. This difference in&#13;
relative openness of large and small countrise is well-known. A more&#13;

interesting question is whether there are divergent structures of&#13;
trade. Figures 4 and 5 shed light on this issue.&#13;
On the import side, small countries have positive coefficients&#13;
for non-food agriculture and capital goods with respect to per capita&#13;
GNP, while large countries have negative ones, indicating that import&#13;
substitution of such products works better in a large market.           By&#13;
contrast, the coefficient for textiles, shoes, and clothing is more&#13;
negative  for  small  countries.    A glance   at Figure   4 shows   small&#13;
countries steadily reduce the share of this category as per capita GNP&#13;
rises, but that it is already low at low income levels in large&#13;
countries - they substitute imports of textiles and kindred products&#13;
early.    Neither large nor small developing countries show much success&#13;
in import substitution of intermediate manufactures (group 4), though&#13;
the share is lower in large countries.&#13;
With regard to exports, the differences between the groups are&#13;
clearer.     First,  the   regression  equations   are  generally  better-&#13;
determined for the large countries than the small ones.       So to speak,&#13;
the range of available export specializations appear to be narrower for&#13;
a large economy.     Large countries also show a bit more success in&#13;
expanding exports of capital, consumer, and intermediate goods than do&#13;
small countries.    This is consistent with the notion that their large&#13;
markets enable them to exploit opportunities for learning and economies&#13;
of scale in sophisticated products at lower levels of per capita&#13;
income. Their share of textile exports falls from a fairly high level&#13;
at low per capita GNP, as they switch toward other products.         These&#13;
observations are of course consistent with the recent theories of trade&#13;
summarized by Stewart (1982).   Amsden (1983) argues along similar   lines&#13;

in connection with possible learning opportunities from South-South&#13;
trade.    Neither  author  notes,  however,  the empirical   dominance  of&#13;
"Ricardian" trade in cash crops for large developing countries.&#13;
5.   GDP Growth Performance, 1970-81&#13;
The next question is about relationships between trade patterns&#13;
and growth. During the 1970s developing countries at low levels of GNP&#13;
per capita also had relatively slow growth.      Hence, a simple split of&#13;
the sample between slow and fast growth countries would be close to a&#13;
split between poor and rich ones. To counter this bias, average country&#13;
growth rates (1970-81) were first regressed against GNPPC.       Countries&#13;
with average rates above or below the regression line were identified as&#13;
fast or slow growers respectively.&#13;
Graphs of import and export shares with respect to per capita&#13;
GNP appear in Figures 6 and 7.       In Figure 6, fast-growing countries&#13;
demonstrate minimal import substitution as per capita GNP rises; their&#13;
share of non-oil imports in GDP is higher than that of the slow&#13;
growers.   Similarly, fast growers have a lower export share.     The non-&#13;
oil trade gaps as percentage shares of GDP take the following values at&#13;
low and high income levels:&#13;
$150         $3000&#13;
Slow Growth Performers               -3.5           5.0&#13;
Fast Growth Performers                7.0           5.5&#13;
The obvious interpretation is that the relatively fast growers&#13;
were able to run larger non-oil trade deficits which they could convert&#13;
into higher oil imports and/or capital formation to support growth.&#13;
This finding runs directly counter to the conventional wisdom that fast-&#13;

growing developing countries are export-led, in the sense that either&#13;
high or increasing export shares do not seem to be associated with fast&#13;
growth.   Trade and growth interactions are more subtle, as we will see&#13;
shortly.&#13;
Note first from Figure 6 that neither group of countries was&#13;
remarkably successful in substituting non-agricultural imports -- aside&#13;
from category 5, the import shares stay relatively flat.      However, the&#13;
fast growers did manage to maintain stable agricultural import shares.&#13;
Their overall food and raw material supplies were presumably less of a&#13;
bottleneck permitting faster growth.&#13;
Second, despite lower overall export shares, the fast growers&#13;
were much more successful in shifting out of agricultural and into&#13;
manufactured exports.     At the same time, their total export share is&#13;
low, but does not decline as rapidly with per capita GNP as in the slow&#13;
growers.    The differences between the two groups seem to lie in the&#13;
fast growers having had ample access to foreign capital and learning how&#13;
to export commodities with relatively high income elasticities of demand&#13;
in the developed countries.      Historico-political   linkages and prior&#13;
local experience in producing sophisticated products would appear to be&#13;
also related to the fast growers' success.&#13;
6.   Regional and Economic Differences&#13;
Historically, many of the countries in Latin America have&#13;
followed import substitution policies.     To see their possible effects,&#13;
in this split all the sample countries in South America are grouped with&#13;
Central America and the Caribbean.     The rest of the sample is divided&#13;
into low and high income groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
The overall import share of the American countries is lowest of&#13;
the three at 16 percent, while the low and high income groups in the&#13;
rest of the world are at 17.4 and 23.5 percent respectively.       (Previous&#13;
results suggest that the import share of the low income countries is low&#13;
because many of them are quite populous and all find it difficult to&#13;
obtain substantial capital inflows.) All three groups have elasticities&#13;
of total import shares with respect to per capita GNP which are close to&#13;
zero (Table 4). The population elasticity is somewhat more negative for&#13;
Latin America.&#13;
The behavior of import shares is shown in Figure 8.        The most&#13;
striking result is the relative success of the Latin American countries&#13;
in import substitution of intermediate manufactures (category 4). Table&#13;
AIO  shows  a well-fitting    regression   for  this  result.    For   other&#13;
categories of imports there do not appear to be large differences among&#13;
the regions -- the positive coefficients for food import shares with&#13;
respect to income in Latin America and low income countries elsewhere&#13;
are not well specified.    Finally, note that the Latin countries show a&#13;
more negative elasticity of the capital goods import share with respect&#13;
to population -- the estimates are -0.33, -0.24, and -0.26 for Latin&#13;
America, and the low and high income regions respectively. The result&#13;
reflects the relative success of the large countries in the region in&#13;
developing their own capital goods sectors.&#13;
For exports, the relatively poor fit of the equations repeats&#13;
itself across   regions.    The largest value of the trade gap occurs on&#13;
average for the high income countries, which have exports amounting to 16.3&#13;
percent of GDP, and imports of 23.5 percent.         Again, access to foreign&#13;

7. Conclusions&#13;
Attempts to explain trade patterns by regression analysis are&#13;
never highly successful in terms of goodness of fit -- the present study&#13;
is no exception.    However, it does show that some aspects of trade can&#13;
be explained by simple structural variables, especially for imports.&#13;
The main results that show up in cross-country regressions for the&#13;
developing world in the decade of the 1970s are the following:&#13;
1.    Shares of both non-oil imports and exports declined with&#13;
rising GNP per capita across the sample, when population&#13;
is used as a variable to reflect market size, contrary to&#13;
both historical and contemporary experience in advanced&#13;
countries.    In this sense,    trade did not serve as an&#13;
engine of growth for the poor countries last decade (and&#13;
probably  earlier).     On  the other hand,    despite  their&#13;
falling shares of imports in GDP, developing countries&#13;
grew sufficiently more rapidly than developed countries in&#13;
the 1970s to make their imports a source of demand growth&#13;
for the industrialized world.&#13;
2.    Higher   income  developing   countries   have  a  wider  gap&#13;
between non-oil imports and exports than relatively poor&#13;
ones. This greater access to foreign finance shows up in&#13;
faster   growth   performance   for   the   more   well-to-do&#13;
economies.&#13;
3.    The  decrease   in both   export  and  import shares as per&#13;
capita GNP rises is largely due to declining importance of&#13;
trade in agricultural    food products.    However,  for the&#13;
faster-growing   group   of   developing   countries   (after&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
correction for income levels) the decline in food imports&#13;
is not observed, suggesting that food supply bottlenecks&#13;
may have been less serious in these countries.&#13;
4.    All  countries   seem  to  be fairly  successful  in import&#13;
substitution of textiles, shoes, and clothing products;&#13;
Latin American countries also substitute intermediate&#13;
manufactures.    There is little substitution of capital&#13;
goods and more sophisticated consumer products on average.&#13;
5.    On the side of exports, fast-growing economies show some&#13;
success    in   shifting    their   specialization    toward&#13;
sophisticated consumer goods and capital goods -- products&#13;
with high income elasticities in the North.     Also, their&#13;
total exports are lower but drop off less rapidly with per&#13;
capita income than those of the slow growers.&#13;
6'.   There are no striking shifts in trade patterns over three&#13;
sub-periods of the 1970s.&#13;

3/ Chenery and Syrquin add a term for the square of LNGNPPC in their&#13;
estimation, but it was dropped in the present study because only&#13;
developing countries with a relatively narrow range of levels of per&#13;

APPENDIX&#13;
Sample Countries&#13;
Countries used in study are given in Table Al.     These countries account&#13;
for approximately 71.8% of developing countries'l/ exports and receive&#13;
71.6% of imports in 1981. There are some notable exceptions. China, Vietnam,&#13;
and Zaire are excluded due to data availability problems, while city states&#13;
such as Hongkong and Singapore were also excluded.        Some of the countries&#13;
included such as Spain and Cyprus may now be classified as developed.      In the&#13;
analysis several subdivisions of sample countries were used.     These groupings&#13;
are also given in Table Al.&#13;
Commodity Aggregation&#13;
Commodity aggregation is given in Table A2.      For exports and imports,&#13;
eight categories were used.    The data source was U.N. Trade tapes from United&#13;
Nations Statistical Office in Geneva.      In this source values are given in&#13;
current U.S.$ for exports f.o.b. and imports c.i.f.        When data in current&#13;
dollars were combined across years, the U.S. GDP deflator was used.&#13;
Detailed Regressions&#13;
Results from estimating all equations are given in Tables A3 through&#13;
A18.&#13;

            Trade patterns in developing countries, 1970-81
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Countries at similar levels of income
            and of similar size have long been known to share similar
            patterns of economic structure and resource allocation. This
            finding should apply to foreign trade as well. This paper
            studies the relationship between shares of seven categories
            of imports and exports in GDP and the logs of GNP per capita
            and population. Trade patterns are analyzed for a panel of
            50 developing countries over the period 1970-81. The results
            suggest that shares of both non-oil imports and exports
            declined with rising GNP per capita across the sample,
            contrary to both historical and contemporary experience in
            advanced countries. Countries seem to be most successful in
            import substitution of textiles, shoes, and clothing
            products. Relatively fast-growing countries have higher
            import and lower export shares in GDP than slow growers.
            They have easier access to sources of finance for larger
            non-oil trade gaps and turn part of the proceeds into faster
            growth. This in turn is reflected in some success in
            shifting their specialization toward sophisticated consumer
            goods and capital goods.
