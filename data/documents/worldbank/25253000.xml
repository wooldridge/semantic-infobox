THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;
                                                               Region: Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
based on indicator sets that measure and benchmark&#13;
regulations applying to domestic small to medium-size          Income category: High income&#13;
businesses through their life cycle. Economies are ranked&#13;
from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 778,061&#13;
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 13,340&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 180&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 178*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;
                                                               Change in rank: -2&#13;

The ease of doing business ranking compares economies&#13;
with one another; the distance to frontier score               DB 2015 DTF: 40.06&#13;

practice, showing the absolute distance to the best            Change in DTF: -0.03&#13;
performance on each Doing Business indicator. When&#13;
compared across years, the distance to frontier score          * DB2015 ranking shown is not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published&#13;

entrepreneurs in an economy has changed over time in           captures the effects of such factors as data revisions&#13;
absolute terms, while the ease of doing business ranking       and the changes in methodology. See the data notes&#13;
can show only how much the regulatory environment has          starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016&#13;
changed relative to that in other economies.                   report for sources and definitions.&#13;

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Access to reliable and affordable electricity is vital for     WHAT THE GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
businesses. To counter weak electricity supply, many&#13;
firms in developing economies have to rely on self-            INDICATORS MEASURE&#13;
supply, often at a prohibitively high cost. Whether&#13;
electricity is reliably available or not, the first step for   Procedures to obtain an electricity connection&#13;
a customer is always to gain access by obtaining a             (number)&#13;
connection.&#13;

Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;

The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;

and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - Equatorial Guinea
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for
            Equatorial Guinea. To allow for useful comparison, the
            profile also provides data for other selected economies
            (comparator economies) for each indicator. Doing Business
            2016 is the 13th edition in a series of annual reports
            measuring the regulations that enhance business activity and
            those that constrain it. Economies are ranked on their ease
            of doing business; for 2015 Equatorial Guinea ranks 180. A
            high ease of doing business ranking means the regulatory
            environment is more conducive to the starting and operation
            of a local firm. Doing Business presents quantitative
            indicators on business regulations and the protection of
            property rights that can be compared across 189 economies
            from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and over time. Doing Business
            sheds light on how easy or difficult it is for a local
            entrepreneur to open and run a small to medium-size business
            when complying with relevant regulations. It measures and
            tracks changes in regulations affecting 11 areas in the life
            cycle of a business: starting a business, dealing with
            construction permits, getting electricity, registering
            property, getting credit, protecting minority investors,
            paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts,
            resolving insolvency and labor market regulation. The data
            in this report are current as of June 1, 2015 (except for
            the paying taxes indicators, which cover the period from
            January to December 2014).
