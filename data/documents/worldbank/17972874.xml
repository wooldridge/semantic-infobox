&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World Bank's&#13;
fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur, The World Bank:&#13;
Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 1997. It is not a formal&#13;
oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the person interviewed. At times&#13;
the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the sources that should be consulted; at&#13;
other times they talked about persons and publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview&#13;
tapes and transcripts begin and end abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives&#13;
believes that this transcript may be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public&#13;
use.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side A] 1&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We decided it would be a very good idea to talk with the directors within the regions&#13;
and sub-regions to which we're going, and that's one thing. There's also lots of other stuff which&#13;
probably [inaudible} in the past. Let us just start--we're going to Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: You'll be going to India?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We're going to India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, and we're sort of slighting India&#13;
relative to some sort of abstract importance, because--partly because I think I know something&#13;
about India. We're going to be there together for only about three days, but then June 9th she's&#13;
going to fly to with me on a still surviving world pass entitlement, and we're going to come back&#13;
to Delhi for a few days. I'll be doing some further meeting with people then.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: And also working on your book, I guess.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, that's right. That's still is a--it's alleged to be in rough complete draft. It's being&#13;
looked at, but there's a lot of work to be done on it, and I'll be sort of trying to update some&#13;
things. We're going to Bangladesh because it's so large and important and has a quite different&#13;
history for the Bank, I think.&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia is really our principal target because it has had this very rich history with the Bank,&#13;
and we haven't been able--or at least we haven't succeeded--in getting a lot of separate testimony&#13;
about it. We've talked to Bernie [Bernard R.] Bell. We've talked to [RobertS.} McNamara. We&#13;
have [Nitisastro] Widjojo on our advisory committee, and he's never attended, and he won't even&#13;
answer his mail although he's supposedly going to be available to us in Jakarta. And so we really&#13;
want to spend about a week in Jakarta trying to get some feel about what's been going on all this&#13;
time between those two institutions, the Barlk and the government.&#13;
&#13;
So Bangladesh is one of three.&#13;
&#13;
Richard then is going on with Devesh to the Philippines. We decided not to give a quick touch&#13;
to China. We thought that would be kind of silly, and so it depends on our finding later on in the&#13;
project that we--how we try to get a hold of China somehow or another.&#13;
&#13;
In Bangladesh we have, as you know, informed Chris [Christopher R.] Willoughby that we're&#13;
coming and that some appointments are being arranged. We suggested some, and I think he&#13;
suggested some. But we'd like to get any kind of thoughts you have about what we should be&#13;
looking at in Bangladesh and who we should be seeing. We won't have time to get out and see&#13;
projects very much, I think. I have been in Bangladesh a few times. The first time was right&#13;
after, just after independence in '72 when everybody was--all the academics were arriving to see&#13;
what they could find in the way of connections and research opportunities. And then I was back&#13;
there for a month in June of'74 with Nurul Islam, except Nurul was not there much. He was&#13;

&#13;
head of planning. He was out shopping for money at that point, but I was there to supposedly&#13;
sort of to take the view of things in general and write up a paper. And '75, I was back with&#13;
another chap taking a view of what had happened to economics in Bangladesh. This was the&#13;
Ford Foundation; I had been working away at that subject. '79, I stopped in on the way to&#13;
UNCTAD V [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development V] in Manila, and then&#13;
saw--on these visits I would usually see people at the IBS [Institute of Bangladesh Studies} and&#13;
some in the government. Last time was in '82, and we were--I was doing something for the&#13;
Asian Bank, and they had done a country study in Bangladesh. We were visiting places where&#13;
they'd done these country studies and stopped in there and saw, again saw the sort of usual&#13;
suspects. I have had a chance to, sort of by accident, stay--do you know Mo Eeth [phonetic}?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I know him, yeah, some. I mean he was . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He was here, and he was at Princeton for a while, and then he once came as sort of the&#13;
senior officer present when DAC [Development Assistance Committee}, had a bunch of people in&#13;
from developing countries, so I've had, stayed in touch with him a bit. That's about the--my&#13;
impressions are sort of gathered back in time at least ten years back, I guess.&#13;
&#13;
Do you want ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No, I don't.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I don't know how much I should--let me just sort of set up some straw men for you,&#13;
that--one question that--one sort of hunch I've had over the years--these are all very simplistic&#13;
impressions--has been the way that the Bank has operated in India and Bangladesh has been&#13;
radically different, that you can sort of see this difference in terms of the Bank playing a much&#13;
heavier hand in not so much the smaller country as the much weaker, more dependent country.&#13;
That was partly based, I guess, on my sense of what happened at the very beginning between the&#13;
Bank and Bangladesh with respect to the representatives. Just Faaland was the first one, and my&#13;
sense is that the Bank felt he got too cozy with the Bengalis, too much, went too Bengali-like,&#13;
and then they got him out of there. He wrote a book with Nurul Islam about aid pressurizing and&#13;
so on. So who do they put in but my old colleague Len [Leonard] Weiss, and I think that was&#13;
pretty funny. Len was a frustrated ambassador, never made ambassador, so he tried to make like&#13;
an ambassador in Bangladesh with all of the trappings. I visited him there once, and apparently&#13;
he really was shaping up all of the--he was doing a great job of aid coordination with a sort of&#13;
heavy hand, and my sense is that the other donors didn't take to that too kindly and that Bernie&#13;
[Bernard] Zagorin, who was there as the UN rep, was much more effective in quietly sort of&#13;
knitting things together. But that-that sort of-well, let me stop there-! mean, that what's&#13;
been going--do you see--are those sort of more or less valid in generalizations, and what's been&#13;
happening since?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, let me say first of all that I'm of course very much a newcomer as far as&#13;
Bangladesh is concerned. I started three months ago, and while I have been to what used to be&#13;
East Pakistan a number of times in the 1960s, I'd never been back since Bangladesh was created&#13;
and only just now visited and spent a very intensive week there. I have followed events, of&#13;
course, a little bit from the sidelines, and so I know about Just Faaland, and I know about Len&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Jochen Kraske&#13;
                             November 5, 1991- Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Weiss and, you know, the kind of reaction and problems that our people had at this end dealing&#13;
with the mission outfit there.&#13;
&#13;
Let me just say on the point of, that you made about the difference in the treatment and the&#13;
relationship between the Bank and Bangladesh and the Bank and India, I mean, this is quite&#13;
obvious. If you look at the dependence of Bangladesh on aid, I think nowadays aid flows&#13;
roughly represent the entire level of public investment in Bangladesh, whereas in India, as you&#13;
know, that share is something like 7 percent or so. So it is-it is very obvious that the stance of&#13;
donors, the influence. that donors can have in a country and in tum the acceptance of their advice&#13;
and impact is very different in a country like Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
There is also, I suppose, something to the origin of the relationship. I mean, the Bank in&#13;
Bangladesh has always been seen as a savior, as a helpful force. You know, I mean in the very&#13;
beginning in '71 Bangladesh was sort of hanging out there. There was a problem with the U.S.&#13;
very much at this point, and the fact that the Bank stood up and recognized Bangladesh,&#13;
organized aid efforts, I think we were also instrumental in getting Victor Urnbricht out there to&#13;
kind of deal with some of the food problems that they had initially, that is something that&#13;
undoubtedly has colored our relationship ever since, whereas in contrast in India, of course, we&#13;
had the episode in 1966 which, you know--irrespective of what our relationship may have been&#13;
in the 1950s and the early 1960s, I'm sure it was all right but not a very close and warm&#13;
relationship; certainly from 1966 on that relationship was heavily influenced by this-by this&#13;
sort of adversarial cataclysmic sort of denouement that we had with the Bell mission and so on&#13;
and so forth and to this day kind of vibrates in the background of every discussion. Even today&#13;
where we have, you know, very successful and close and harmonious relations and agreement on&#13;
these sensitive issues of policy reform, this sort of history is not, not forgotten. It's always on the&#13;
minds of people.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The Indians have used it very well, haven't they? [laughter]&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right. Now with the-yeah, Len Weiss, I remember my colleagues here would kind&#13;
of moan and groan, exactly also because of his ambassadorial behavior. Well, that expressed&#13;
itself in sort of Len Weiss every day sending reams of cables reporting, you know, all the gossip,&#13;
everything that in the newspapers showed up, you know. I mean, it was every year,,every day,&#13;
there were sort of, you know, 10, 12 feet of cable messages. And the next thing, also, these&#13;
messages, they were addressed to Mr. McNamara and copied to everybody else in the Bank. So&#13;
everybody was kind of struggling with this, you know, large volume of verbiage that came out of&#13;
the mission in Bangladesh. I mean, it was sort of clear he had learned his trade in the embassy,&#13;
and he was operating very much like an ambassador.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What is-how is the--has there been a particular story on this? You say, of course,&#13;
that Bangladesh has indeed been quite dependent on the Bank for public investment resources,&#13;
and that's been true without respite ever since the start of the country. Have there been any sort&#13;
of ups and downs, crises, particular ones, in the relationship, or has it just been a sort of steady&#13;
resource transfer process? I suppose that there has been more accent on policy in the last, in the&#13;
80s, than before.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yeah, I suppose so. I mean, this is, you know--very clearly my, you know,&#13;
knowledge is not sufficient to give you a very good picture, but I suppose, yeah, there has been a&#13;
sort of steady relationship of lending and of resource transfers. There was also, I believe, a&#13;
steady tradition of these sort of low-conditionality quick transfer projects, at least in the earlier&#13;
years, modeled a little bit on the Indian industrial imports credits. And there has also been, I&#13;
suppose, all along frustration and irritation related to, you know, the weak institutional setup in&#13;
Bangladesh and the poor performance on the implementation side, slow decision-making, long&#13;
delays when it comes to procurement decisions in particular, and drawn-out disbursement&#13;
profiles for individual investment projects.&#13;
&#13;
Now, there has been, at least last year--you know, the frustration with the government's lack of&#13;
facing up to some of the economic problems that they were facing and also, generally, I think the&#13;
frustration with the sort of lack of decision-making and so on boiled up in the aid group meeting&#13;
that they had in May, April or May of 1990, when the donors sort of, you know, united and told&#13;
the Bengalis that, I mean, enough is enough and unless they were really now getting down to&#13;
kind of shaping up and adopting fiscal policies and made structural changes that would be&#13;
conducive to more greater efficiency and better growth performance, that they would not be&#13;
ready to support them with continued assistance and at the meeting demonstrated this by making&#13;
a level of pledges which was significantly below the level of the sort of annual pledges that they&#13;
had been making previously and also fell significantly short of the Bank's recommendations. I&#13;
mean, the Bank's recommendation--if I remember it correctly in the report--had been given with&#13;
all these qualifications, but, you know, still, I mean a recommendation had been made, but the&#13;
donors sort of simply said, "Look, I mean, nothing doing. We want to really see some changes."&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Was this spontaneous in the meeting itself, or had there been some caucusing going&#13;
on?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: It had been kind of, you know--it had become clear, I think, by the time the meeting&#13;
convened that there was real unhappiness and that people, you know, were not prepared to just&#13;
kind of put up with this for the sake of peace and so on and so forth. And I think--what I thought&#13;
was particularly remarkable, it was sort of a sentiment that was carried not really so much by the&#13;
U.S. or by--well, the U.K., I think, was very important in this thing, but the Scandinavian&#13;
countries and the Dutch, you know, were very militant in that, in that respect. And, as I said, the&#13;
aid pledge level dropped from, I don't know, above 2 billion dollars to something like 1.4 or 1.2.&#13;
This is a matter of record; one would have to check this. And there was then agreement that the&#13;
government would go back, would examine the situation, decide what they felt they would do to&#13;
respond to the criticisms, and that in November or six months later there would be a meeting to&#13;
examine again the situation.&#13;
&#13;
And this meeting took place last November in Dacca and confirmed that, yes, indeed the&#13;
government had sort of shaped up and taken decisions, made changes, you know, gone back to&#13;
the IMF [International Monetary Fund}, worked out the stabilization program and so on and so&#13;
forth. And there was then some--I don't know--soine of the donors may be have given pledges&#13;
conditiorlal on improvement, and these pledges would then become operational.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jochen Kraske&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                      6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But in any event, it was then this year in May when the meeting took place that, you know, the&#13;
sort of tum-around was really acknowledged and appreciated by everybody, and Bangladesh was&#13;
rewarded with a very substantial increase in pledges. Again they went back up to 2.3 billion&#13;
dollars. In other words, I mean, an episode here where, you know, there was a clear&#13;
confrontation between the donor community and the government of Bangladesh where the donor&#13;
community sort of said, "We are not going to underwrite this kind of situation. You've got to&#13;
change. You've got to do, you know, whatever: one, two, three, four. Only if you do that, we&#13;
are prepared to continue."&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And remind me the--through this period from, say, the beginning of '90 through the&#13;
middle of~91, there was no change of regime?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No, I mean, that was, I mean, there was of course some--and this is again where my&#13;
own knowledge of the situation is insufficient to judge this--but clearly the economic&#13;
performance was to some extent also reflecting political, the political situation. I mean the&#13;
declining kind of morals and performance of the [General Hussain Muhammad] Ershad regime,&#13;
growing corruption and what have you. And the political changes then of course occurred in,&#13;
well, late last year and early this year. I mean, in December, I think, is when the trouble really&#13;
started, and in January, I think, is when Ershad had to resign, and then in March they had the&#13;
elections.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, so there was that .&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: So it followed them.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. All right. Well, that's really, I suppose, the, almost the way consortia were&#13;
supposed to work, that is, that you didn't have to have structural adjustment lending of a program&#13;
type and particular sort of policy targets, but you had a review the whole sort of policy scenario--&#13;
and a critical review--and then the donors would respond as they would. And that, then--it&#13;
sometimes got so routinized that not very much along those lines happened; there was a kind of&#13;
shadow sort of play that went around that doesn't seem to affect transfer outcomes, but this time&#13;
it did.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yeah, this tin1e it did. I mean, it is--I think you will see that this is the sort of&#13;
episode that you may want to look at and focus on. And as I said, I don't know that there have&#13;
been similar experiences earlier. I don't think anything as sort of crass and explicit as this one.&#13;
&#13;
Now, there's another example which, although at this point is not really as yet part of history, but&#13;
it is still an interesting kind of exan1ple. The government of Bangladesh has been talking about&#13;
building this bridge--I'm sure you've heard about it--across the Brahmaputra. And this bridge has&#13;
sort of assumed enormous significance in Bangladesh. It is seen sort of as a national imperative.&#13;
It is seen as the thing to link the two parts of the country which otherwise, you know, forever&#13;
have been separate and so on and so forth. And it is a project that is supported politically across&#13;
the board by, you know, all the parties. And the present government feels particularly compelled&#13;
to pursue this project aggressively because the Ershad government was, you know, very&#13;
effectively supporting this project, and many people said, "Well, I mean, now we lost the Ershad&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jochen Kraske&#13;
                               November 5, 1991 -Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
government, and does this mean that we now also lost this bridge?" So they have to demonstrate&#13;
that, no, they'r~ just as keen and effective in supporting this particular project.&#13;
&#13;
Now, this bridge will cost half a billion dollars or so--that's the kind of ticket price--and will take&#13;
a long time to construct, and there are a lot of arguments about the economic justification of this&#13;
thing, the economic return on this sort of investment. Certainly, if you use the kind of standard,&#13;
you know, Mickey Mouse type of evaluation, counting all the pedestrians and their time and&#13;
using the Bengali salary levels in dharmas, you know, it is very hard to, kind of, demonstrate that&#13;
this thing is really economic. Also, there are technical problems which have to do with the&#13;
enormity of this river, and, you know, what happens in that river if it is in spate, and, you know,&#13;
how the thing is shifting around, and the plan is to kind of funnel the whol-e thing under the&#13;
bridge. Now, otherwise, of course, you may end up having the river somewhere else and the&#13;
bridge just sitting in the countryside. [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It just gushes down out of the Himalayas.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: It comes, and all over the place, you know. I mean, it's not the river, it's not a sort of&#13;
organized situation, but the whole Bangladesh is just the mouth of a river, if you will, kind of.&#13;
The whole-you know, it goes down about 6,000 meters, I think, before you hit bedrock. This is&#13;
all mud that has come down from the Himalayas and deposited in the thing, and the country is in&#13;
that sense also growing all the time. I mean, there is constantly land being added at the end.&#13;
&#13;
But now, you know, the interesting thing is, of course, the donors. They take very different&#13;
views of this thing. I mean, on the one hand there are some donors who are very keen to see this&#13;
project: the Japanese, for instance. I mean, this is big business, and--but on the other hand there&#13;
are people, you know, like the Dutch or some of the Scandinavians, who say, "Well, I mean, gee,&#13;
you know, your people are hungry, and you need to deal with education and population control&#13;
and so on and so forth. Now, you deal with those things, and when you've done that, come back&#13;
and then maybe we'll look at this bridge. But for the time being we think you need that bridge as&#13;
you need a hole in the head." Now, but, I mean, the interesting thing is here, you know, that on&#13;
the one hand the donors of course are saying, "We need democracy. We need transparency. We&#13;
need a government that is, you know, responsive to the will of the people," and on the other hand&#13;
a situation where the same donors say, "Well, I mean, if the will of the people expresses itself&#13;
and comes up with something that we consider foolish, we think that will of the people should be&#13;
set aside and those.things that we consider important should be constructed." In other words,&#13;
there is a real sort of potential conflict. It is not an issue of sovereignty, really, but really an&#13;
issue of, you know, at what point do you really follow, you know, the wishes of the recipient&#13;
government and at what point are you kind of blindly driven by sort of economic considerations&#13;
and, you know, calculations of rates of return and so on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
Mind you, I mean we are still in the process of looking at the whole thing, and this question of&#13;
the economic rate of return is one that preoccupies us greatly and will ultimately really depend&#13;
on how much you can really count on induced traffic by this bridge. I think transport economists&#13;
have been notoriously poor in predicting what is happening if you sort of really establish son1e of&#13;
these sort of major arterial links in an economy and how this impact~ on the functioning of the&#13;
whole economy.&#13;

&#13;
LEWIS: How long has this been a big issue? Do you know?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: It has been around for five, six, seven years, I think.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Back            mean, sort of scaling off my memory--in '74 there was a similar issue, but&#13;
it wasn't a bridge. It was simply getting energy back and forth across the river. I think there was&#13;
a big issue about some kind of major cable kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right. They have built one of those.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They built that.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: They have built one of those, I don't know, five years ago or so. And now they feel&#13;
they have to build a second one. That is one of the supportive arguments for the bridge. There's&#13;
also a question whether you shouldn't take gas across that bridge.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, I was going to ask you about that.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: There is also--also a question--I mean, I think one of the strong arguments for the&#13;
bridge would be to let the Indians use that, you know, road throlfgh Bangladesh and across the&#13;
bridge as a transit corridor to go to some of their northeastern states rather than going all the way&#13;
around.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I remember at that time natural gas seemed to be about the&#13;
only resource, natural resource that they had--except for too much water. And I don't know if--&#13;
have they got, have they proven quite a resource?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Sure, and they have been--in the meantime, you know, there have been further&#13;
drillings and more discoveries, and more recently we've been involved in supporting them. And&#13;
they've discovered now--in a sense, you know, this is creating quite a complication--they've&#13;
found rather wet gas which means that now they have to separate this stuff and, you know, use&#13;
all the distillates to make other [inaudible] and so on so forth.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They're--they're using it themselves? Are they exporting?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: They're not yet exporting, but that is also again one option, that they could, of&#13;
course, export gas--to mutual advantage--to India.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Urn-huh, urn-huh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That would--in fact that would be quite sensible,&#13;
do that by pipeline.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Sure, sure.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah. Well, there are some really interesting development strategy puzzles&#13;
about Bangladesh that you are into. Did you ever see the way they build roads? You know how&#13;
they get the ballast for roads? There literally-there's no rock in the damned country, anywhere!&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Not a single stone.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So you have to bake bricks.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: All mud.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You bake bricks and break them up in order to make the ballast for roads.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yeah, you have to use the mud, you make bricks, the whole countryside is full of&#13;
these brick kilns, and then they sit and break this thing up, and then they put it into the, you&#13;
know, as gravel into the road. And of course it's not very good material, and the roads tend to&#13;
sag and deteriorate very fast.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Is there-there's always been a lot of romanticizing about the eastern waters and how&#13;
they should be managed. You have this tremendous groundwater reservoir from the Gangetic&#13;
Plain, and you have this torrent coming down on the east side creating this problem for this&#13;
bridge, and, you know, there has been these other ideas about digging a canal across Bangladesh&#13;
and back flowing it up and parking this excess water in the sponge in the Gangetic--it's&#13;
wonderful, it's sort of science fiction kind of stuff, but it, of course, involves a very engaged kind&#13;
of collaboration between two countries of very unequal size and very--has the Bank played any&#13;
role in sort of exploring those possibilities or is it so . . .&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No, we haven't. I mean, the Bengalis, of course, from time to time have implored us&#13;
to get involved, and then this has been also taken the form of people writing to or talking to the&#13;
government of India. But from the part of the Indians, they have always said, well, ''Thanks, but&#13;
no thanks, you know. We will call you; don't call us. This is a bilateral issue, and we are&#13;
advanced enough to deal with this ourselves, so just stay back and wait."&#13;
&#13;
And of course, I mean, this--the Bank then occasionally would have said, "'Ah, well, don't you&#13;
remember the Indus, and what a wonderful experience that was, and shouldn't we have another?"&#13;
&#13;
And the Indians would say, ''Indus? My word! You know, we were screwed!" And so on and&#13;
so forth!&#13;
&#13;
And of course, I mean, the reason why Indus happened had nothing to do with the Bank. I mean,&#13;
the Bank happened to be around, and Sir William Iliff and so on was the man who carried this&#13;
thing through. But ultimately it was simply [Jawarhalal} Nehru, who was enough of a&#13;
statesman to say, "Look, I mean, there's one problem that we can solve and that we can in future&#13;
do without, and this is the water thing. And never mind, you know, how many cusecs and so on&#13;
in Pakistan. I want a deal on this thing, and I want to see this thing resolved." And that is how it&#13;
was resolved. And I'm sure you can take the view--and if you make objective calculations, you&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
may probably find that the Pakistanis got more water out of this thing than, you know, was&#13;
exactly their fair share. They did because Nehru said, "It doesn't matter."&#13;
&#13;
But you don't have anybody like this now to deal with the Nepali issue or to deal with the&#13;
Bangladesh issue. And until and unless you get somebody like this in India to run the show and&#13;
say, "Look, I mean, for all practical purposes Bangladesh and Nepal are part of India, and it&#13;
doesn't matter one bit whether, you know, they get more or, you know, how this thing is split,&#13;
because in the end the returns will all come back to India."&#13;
&#13;
And this is also why I think--I mean, if you look at developing countries, you know, we are very&#13;
good at making all these projections and this is happening and so on, and you just see all these&#13;
numbers and so on and so forth, but ultimately somehow you have to have an image of what is&#13;
going to happen, you know, as a result in the long term. I mean, what is going to be the future of&#13;
Bangladesh? Is that going to be some kind of Holland, or, you know, is this going to be another&#13;
sort of Hong Kong or Singapore, or, you know, I mean how do you visualize it? Well, the only&#13;
way I can visualize this is that it will, you know, go where India is going. If India, you know,&#13;
goes up, so will Bangladesh. And the Indians also have to see it that way. If Bangladesh is&#13;
lagging behind India, what is going to happen is that Bengalis will, you know, just march down&#13;
to India by the millions.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And the Assam Â·problem. Yeah, yeah. Fifteen hundred miles of border between these&#13;
two countries. No way to put a fence around it.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: And even now, I mean, you go to Nizamuddin in Delhi and you will see them there,&#13;
you know, they're living on the street.Â· And every day there're, you know, a few hundred more&#13;
arnv1ng.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's an easy country to flee, if you're rational.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I wonder if there's been some evolution in the form of Bank lending to Bangladesh--as&#13;
there has been everywhere--particularly projects through adjustment. And then if there has been,&#13;
what has that meant for the quality of your investments? Do you see anything happening in that&#13;
sense?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, there has been, I mean, a shift from--well, as I said, earlier on in the&#13;
relationship there was a sort of element in our program that was essentially transfer of resources&#13;
and on a kind of low conditionality basis. I mean, here you have to look at the record again; I'm&#13;
not--1 don't have these things, you know, readily in my head. I don't know how long this went&#13;
on. It is my impression that it went, you know, quite a bit longer than our similar lending in&#13;
India went.&#13;
&#13;
Now more recently, of course, there has been a fair amount of policy-based adjustment type&#13;
lending to Bangladesh. We've had loans in support--we haven't had any sort of outright SALs&#13;
[structural adjustment loans] in Bangladesh, but we've had the sort of sector or topic-based&#13;
adjustment loans. There has been one dealing with banking reform. There has been one dealing&#13;
with the industrial sector reform. There has been one focused on the energy sector. And in each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jochen Kraske&#13;
                              November 5, 1991- Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
case there has been the sort of requisite conditionality dealing with the policies in the sector. In&#13;
terms of the proportions in our total lending, I reckon it must have been about, you know, 25&#13;
percent or so that was transferred in this form.&#13;
&#13;
On the project side, I mean, we have--I suppose we have had support of investment programs in&#13;
the power sector, in the gas sector, in road transport, and related to this thing then, you know,&#13;
conditionality related to, you know, budgetary allocations for operation and maintenance,&#13;
institutional strengthening and reform and so on and so forth. I don't think there has been any&#13;
trend of sort of stiffening any of these conditions. And finally there have projects that sort of&#13;
dealt with more discrete operations like Chittagong water and Dacca water supply organization,&#13;
and those have been exceedingly frustrating and up to now pretty unsuccessful in dealing with&#13;
the, you know, entrenched mess of these municipal or quasi-municipal organizations.&#13;
&#13;
So I think you have--in other words, I would see sort of three types of operational interventions:&#13;
(1) the kind of policy-based sector-wide interventions; (2) the sort of support of, you know,&#13;
sector-wide investment programs; and (3) the kind of, you know, specifically targeted&#13;
institutional kind of investment operations.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You know, let me ask you a question about institution building (capacity building, it's&#13;
called these days), partly about Bangladesh as much as it fits but also not necessarily, really ask&#13;
you as a savvy veteran of the institution. One hypothesis would be that the Bank has not been&#13;
awfully good at institution-building somehow or it hasn't been its comparative advantage, that if&#13;
you look at, if you had the introduction I had from Delhi in the '60s, they had these sort of hands-&#13;
on people like the Ford Foundation. We had quite a lot of work, some of it pretty successful,&#13;
going on in AID [US. Agency for International Development} in agriculture universities and so&#13;
on. The Bank was not into that sort of thing. The Bank's a very big organization; it's&#13;
headquarter-centered. It doesn't have a lot of personnel in the field usually, operates with&#13;
missions coming in and out. And it--you can imagine it is sort of almost muscle-bound when it&#13;
comes to doing institution building. Is there anything in that or is it--you've been talking about&#13;
some things that you've been doing in Bangladesh lately that sound more .&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Yeah, well, I mean, the question--I suppose you put it rightly. The question is&#13;
whether it is enough to reform an institution if you can provide the appropriate blueprint for that&#13;
organization. But in fact, of course, a lot more is needed, and if you have people on the ground&#13;
who can kind of get in there and help shape things on a day to-day basis, that certainly helps.&#13;
Although I have to say, you know, if you look at Pantnager [G. B. Pant University ofAgriculture&#13;
and Technology} or Ludhiana [Punjab Agricultural University] today, I mean, it's a pity. I&#13;
mean, they're no longer what they used to be.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Those were the two stars.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: I mean, they've sort of sunk back to the level of the sort of typical Indian university.&#13;
So in that sense, you know, while the Ford Foundation or Rockefeller, you know, while they may&#13;
have been successful at the time and for some reason, you know, it kind of jelled and you had . .&#13;

KRASKE: . . inevitable changes of personnel and of leadership and so on and so forth in the&#13;
organizations and in the environment around the organization.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They sort of sink back to the cultural average.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: So they sink back to the average of the whole thing, get caught up in the._...,~~...,~ . . .~ . . .&#13;
mess.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the end, I suppose, you know, much of the performance of these institutions will depend on&#13;
the general environment in which they operate. If you go to India also you find, you know, some&#13;
states--Maharashtra or, you know, Tamil Nadu or what--where these things work, where the state&#13;
electricity boards are reasonably efficient and so on and so forth, and yet at the same time you&#13;
have the Bihars and the lJPs [Uttar Pradesh] and so on where, you know, the damned thing just&#13;
is completely caught up in the political morass of these states.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: A huge question. I know we can't keep you too long, but you've let the-you've sort&#13;
of opened up--what should we be trying to say or do about the subject of corruption in our&#13;
history?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, I mean, yeah--I've often suggested that people should really write a book&#13;
about corruption and a sort of typology of corruption. I mean, there are, of course, many&#13;
different facets of corruption. Some, you know, are quite helpful. I mean, there is the corruption&#13;
that is just correcting the injustice and inequity of very poor civil service salaries and&#13;
remuneration. Nothing wrong with that. You know, I mean, the marketplace that we talk so&#13;
much about in a way takes over and fixes what otherwise is not correct. Then there is the kind&#13;
of, you know, the greasing element that you have that will-a system that otherwise from the&#13;
setup is awkward and doesn't work well, you know, can kind of overcome the frictions and&#13;
problems built into the--again, nothing wrong. But then at the other spectrum you have the sort&#13;
of thing where you just have like highway robbery, you know, people who are raising some&#13;
artificial hurdle right in the middle of nowhere and holding up everybody who comes across and&#13;
extracting, you know, money, protection money, for no reason other than their own, you know,&#13;
enrichment. And that clearly is the worst and most pernicious form of corruption.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
At the Bank, of course, in our sort of dealings, we have what--for many years, of course, the&#13;
subject of corruption was somehow sort of taboo; you were not supposed to mention this thing.&#13;
You know, you were--I mean, you knew about it, and you were also--there was a sort of&#13;
understanding that you knew about it and that you had to somehow try to design systems or&#13;
institutions to work around the way, but there was never any way that you could talk about this&#13;
openly and explicitly. There was never any reference to corruption.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: To the host countries, you mean.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: To the host country, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Did you talk about it even within the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Oh, you would talk here in the institution, sure, but even there was, you know, often&#13;
it was more in the form of suspicion: "Yes, I mean, this may be a problem there, and we better&#13;
watch out and deal with this," and so on and so forth. There was also never any reference to&#13;
corruption in our economic reports. You know, I bet you you can read any report until, you&#13;
know, 1980 certainly, written by the Bank and you will not, you know, or only rarely and only in&#13;
the most general form find any specific reference to corruption, I mean, just as we were also&#13;
never commenting on the level of military expenditures. But these conventions, you know, have&#13;
changed now. And now, you know, yeah, I mean people talk about corruption. And of course&#13;
in--when you deal with adjustment processes and changing policy regimes and so on, I mean, it&#13;
is an explicit and accepted objective of these changes to do away with corruption, sure. That has&#13;
become very much part of the sort of objectives that we are . . [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Sort of eliminating rent-seeking opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Rent-seeking, yeah, sure. That's a euphemism for the thing.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah. Are there any--ever been any sort of norms within the Bank, unwritten,&#13;
for differentiating between these different-! mean, the big-scale corruptions against the kind of&#13;
almost productive, instrumental kinds of ...&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No, no, there haven't been, no, no. I mean, I have whenever, you know, there has&#13;
been talk about corruption, discussion about corruption, I have always said, "Look, I mean, let's&#13;
be quite sure that we understand what we're talking about, you know. I mean, what is the role of&#13;
corruption in this particular circumstance? Is it really that pernicious kind of extortionist form,&#13;
or is it more of a sort of corrective introduced into an otherwise imperfect system?"&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You and I both cut our teeth on a case where I think this was a very useful distinction.&#13;
My sense--unless I was terribly naive in India in 1960--was that there was very little of this big&#13;
time corruption. It was an unusually honorable--it was because of the Gandhian tradition, but the&#13;
self image of these people was that they were really saviors of the world and--even if they didn't&#13;
quite measure up. And then there--the rest of it was sort of like tip-taking, the baksheesh and so&#13;
on, it was to correct these distortions in the wage structure and to get things moving and so on.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
And my perception also is that that began to turn violently in India about the early '70s&#13;
sometime.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Right, yeah, and has, I mean, progressively expanded and also sort of gone up the&#13;
scale and become much more blatant and .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: .. you know, really n1thless. I mean, it's shocking the sort of stories that one hears&#13;
now about ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right. It's very hard to know what the hell one does about this.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Do you know of any time that a loan has been held up because the Bank felt corruption&#13;
was involved, either in specific projects or at the national level?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No, I don't. You mean in terms of not proceeding with the loan or in terms ofÂ·&#13;
suspending disbursements or anything of that sort?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Either one, any interruptions.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No, I'm not aware of any problem. I think, I mean we would also still pride&#13;
ourselves to think that the sort of rules and procedures that we follow make it very difficult to,&#13;
you know, directly corrupt the kind of Bank assistance in any form. What is, of course,&#13;
sometimes apparent is that, you know, you find that procurement decisions are suddenly made,&#13;
and we cannot endorse these decisions because they're, you know, totally out of line with our&#13;
rules and with the whole system that we have in the evaluation and that we carried out and&#13;
agreed with the borrower, and, you know, I mean, there's obvious then that some minister&#13;
suddenly got in the act and said, you know, "I want this company to get the contract." And then&#13;
we had to kind of withdraw from that particular operation if the minister was indeed powerful&#13;
enough to make his decision stick. And they would then have to find the money elsewhere to&#13;
fund this contract. There have been cases like this in India. But, again, I mean, my memory is&#13;
not good enough to be able to tell you exactly, but I'm pretty certain that you would find&#13;
examples of this kind in India.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Does Bob Klitgaard have any kind of reputation or image in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Who?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS:. Klitgaard, you know, Robert Klitgaard?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You don't. Well, that answers my question. He used to be in Pakistan for the Ford&#13;
Foundation. He then was an associate professor and aide to Derek Bok at Harvard, and he had a&#13;
Bank contract to go to Equatorial Guinea. He wrote a book called Tropical Gangsters. He's also&#13;

&#13;
written a little academic treatise on corruption. And it's a very-his book, he fancies himself as a&#13;
novelist and also it's a macho success story, he's talking about his conquests of ladies and so on.&#13;
It's quite a strange book, but it is about corruption. And it doesn't put the Bank in the corruption&#13;
business by any means, but it certainly suggests that there is a kind of blind eye and that there's--&#13;
a lot of it has to do with his trying to sort of counsel these Guineans to pass muster with the Fund&#13;
on some things, so a certain amount of card trickery that's done and so on. It's quite a-it's sort&#13;
of a fun book if you can avoid being irritated by it. But I just wondered whether he's--he hasn't&#13;
become a big cult hero in the Bank, apparently.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: No. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Did you see much kind of clear differences between Bangladesh and India? Of course,&#13;
in India it's so hard to [inaudible} At the level of what we've been talking about before, sort of&#13;
project implementation, you mentioned right at the beginning that there was some frustration&#13;
around, there seems to be no advance and donors were frustrated by that aspect. Has this been&#13;
something all along? Has there been a deterioration? Is Bangladesh quite behind other countries&#13;
that you know, like India, like Pakistan?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, I mean, let me say first of all that I see Bangladesh, of course, very much as&#13;
part of India. I mean, if by historical accidents it happens to be a separate country, but there's no&#13;
doubt that culturally and otherwise it is sort of part of India. And if you look at the, sort of,&#13;
surrounding states in India--West Bengal, Bihar, Assam--you'll find that the level of institutional&#13;
robustness and maturity and so on is very comparable to what you find in Bangladesh. In other&#13;
words, I mean, it is a phenomenon that is kind of more, you know--it is part of that whole region.&#13;
It is part of the Bengali culture and the sort of eastern Indian culture.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the attitude of the donors has, I suppose, been, you know, carried and colored heavily by&#13;
the, you know, tragedies that Bangladesh of course is exposed to periodically and that are, you&#13;
know, of superhuman dimensions. I mean, where else do you have, you know, 140,000 people&#13;
perish in one day and, you know, yet nobody really kind of thinks much about it, does much&#13;
about it, you know? I mean, if you just for a moment think about the kind of hoo-hah and&#13;
excitement that we have if some airplane crashes and, you know, a hundred people get killed&#13;
and, you know, here you have these, I mean, absolutely vast tragedies. And you can say that you&#13;
know this happened last April. Now, you know, it is going to happen again next year, and it is&#13;
going to happen the year after; this is going to, you know, recur, and inasmuch as the population&#13;
of this place is still growing very rapidly that the numbers of people that get wiped out by these&#13;
things are going to increase, so new records will be established all the time.&#13;
&#13;
Now, this has very much colored and carried the donors in their involvement with Bangladesh.&#13;
So unlike in India and unlike in so many other countries where the aid relationship really has&#13;
been pretty much a business relationship--you know, I mean, "Let's help these people to make&#13;
their investments and, you know, push them forward and at the same time sell some of our stuff&#13;
here"--in Bangladesh the kind of charitable humanitarian element has all along been a very&#13;
powerful consideration, you know, which accounts both for the level of aid and,also, of course,&#13;
to some extent for the form of aid. I mean, food aid is still a huge element in the whole aid&#13;
program in Bangladesh. And on that, if you consider that sort of the continuing kind of base in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 this aid relationship which accounts for--I don't know; half or, you know, it's hard to say, you&#13;
 know, what level you want to attribute to this--the kind of frustrations and irritations and&#13;
 fluctuations related to these irritations, you know, account for relatively little on top of this sort&#13;
 of basic thing.&#13;
&#13;
 WEBB: Do you worry that the--that there's some aid dependence? Do you sense that&#13;
 Bangladesh is learning to [both speaking at once] itself.&#13;
&#13;
  KRASKE: Well, ever so slowly. I think--I mean, when I went there now and spent a week and,&#13;
  as I said, it was really a very intensive week. I mean, Chris Willoughby really makes you--you&#13;
, know, I don't know whether he'll do for you what he did for me, but boy, I mean, from 8 o'clock&#13;
  in the morning until11 o'clock at night it was nonstop! There wasn't even time to eat lunch or&#13;
  anything, you know. There's really--anyway, but I did get away from this thing with the sense&#13;
  that basically, you know, it could work in Bangladesh if-now, one thing is, you know, the level&#13;
  of investment is very low, I mean, 11.8 percent or so right now, compared to India 24 percent or&#13;
  so, you know. And yet they've had growth rates of3.5 to 4 percent on average~ Now, you know,&#13;
  that suggests if they can only step up the level of investments, you know, they should be able to&#13;
  wring out also more growth. I mean, it wouldn't--presumably the capital output ratio would&#13;
  increase, you know. If you step up investment levels, you wouldn't have the same sort of levels&#13;
  of efficiency, but still, I mean, you could certainly get more if you had more investment. So if&#13;
  you can persuade the private sector somehow to invest more ...&#13;
&#13;
 The level of savings, of course, is depressingly low now. Of course, income levels are very low,&#13;
 and, you know, there's--but still, I mean, compared to India, you know, as a proportion, savings&#13;
 really could be higher in Bangladesh as well.&#13;
&#13;
 And if you could have some foreign private investment in Bangladesh: the garment industry is&#13;
 something that has sort of taken off very nicely. I'm sure the sort of processed agricultural and&#13;
 food industry is something that could, you know, grow a lot faster. There's all sorts of other&#13;
 light manufacturing activities that, you know, may transfer to this thing.&#13;
&#13;
 So, I mean, there's no--I would not see any intrinsic reason why, you know, Bangladesh couldn't&#13;
 grow significantly faster. And once, you know, that happens, you know, you would then also be&#13;
 able to bring some of the problems, other problems under control.&#13;
&#13;
 You know, one other--this is what I wrote to you about, this labor problem. If you look at South&#13;
                                                    1&#13;
 Asia and you ask yourself, you know, "Why isn t South Asia doing what East Asia has done all&#13;
 along? Is it just a matter of, you know, following the right policy prescriptions?" Well, I think&#13;
 one real and very significant difference is the very different relationship between labor and&#13;
 management and also, of course, in a sense, government in this. They're not mutually&#13;
 supportive. They're sort of .always at each others' throats, fighting each other all the way, all the&#13;
 time, and suspicious of each other. And in all these adjustment programs that we have now in&#13;
 India and Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, dealing with this labor situation is one of the, you know,&#13;
 trickiest and most--the hardest kind of things to handle. And it is also, of course, so hard to&#13;
 handle because these economies are by and large stagnant. I mean, okay, you've had growth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Jochen Kraske&#13;
                                November 5, 1991 -Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
rates slightly ahead of population growth, but, you know, basically it has been stagnant as far as&#13;
sort of employment growth and so on is concerned.&#13;
&#13;
And the attitude of the entrenched and organized labor organizations has been basically&#13;
protective, you know, a sort of closed shop type mentality: make sure that, you know, the others&#13;
don't nip in and take part of what you have kind of been able to acquire for your membership. So&#13;
these guys go and in the name of poverty and so on, alleviation, they come with these wage&#13;
demands and strike and agitate and so on and so forth, while, of course, the vast majority of&#13;
people, far larger people than their membership, are sitting out there unemployed, you know,&#13;
totally impoverished. That has no effect.&#13;
&#13;
Now, but once the economy begins to grow, this thing is going to break down, you know, and&#13;
larger numbers of people get sucked into the organized labor markets, and you will not only&#13;
grow but you will also be able to overcome some of these terrible shackles that are holding&#13;
things back. This is what I consider to be one of the most important elements in the kind of, in&#13;
any kind of scenario for improving ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You find quite a lot of that in Bangladesh also?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: In Bangladesh, sure. I mean, in these jute mills, you know, it is just terrible.&#13;
&#13;
And you can also see that--you know, I had this--when I left, one of the things that Chris&#13;
Willoughby organized was a press conference, which I really hate like hell! So, I said, "Look"--I&#13;
mean, there is some commission that they want to set up now, and they want to kind of establish&#13;
things like minimum wages and, you know, I mean, Christ, this is the last thing that they need to&#13;
make, you know, life, complicate life even further. So I said, 'Â·'Look, I mean, one of the things&#13;
that--you've got people, and this is some of your advantage, also. I mean, you have to see if you&#13;
grow, you know, that you get to compete in areas of labor intensive production and so on and so&#13;
forth. But for that purpose it is also very important that you follow a wage policy that is sensible&#13;
and that is oriented by the productivity gains and by the ability of the individual enterprise to&#13;
pay. If you exceed these things, you're, you know, bound to, you know, wreck the whole system&#13;
and wreck the individual enterprise. And what happens is either the thing has to shut down or&#13;
else the government has to come in and bail you out."&#13;
&#13;
And the jute industry is, you know, just one prime example of this whole situation. The whole&#13;
jute industry is sick because of the labor situation. I mean, it's one element, but it's probably--it's&#13;
the most important element in the whole sickness of that industry. The unions, they're just&#13;
powerful enough and they're also politically influential enough to make their points stick,&#13;
irrespective of the economic reality of the situation.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What about the Bank's role in Bangladesh? I wonder how you see that because beyond&#13;
the purely humanitarian imperatives, really, in the case of Bangladesh, I often wonder-the Bank&#13;
seems, obviously, doing many things, but I wonder whether one of those is more important in the&#13;
case of Bangladesh. Is it principally the Bank as a teacher, do you think, particularly at the level&#13;
of public administration, quality of management, institutions? Or is it more avoiding, helping&#13;
the country avoid big mistakes through major policy conditionalities, just give it time, as it were?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jochen Kraske&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                     18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Or is it more, kind of, you just keep pumping in a bit of extra money every year, there will be a&#13;
little bit of extra every year, a little more savings, a little more investment, that some takeoff will&#13;
gradually develop? Do you have some sense of what the Bank is really doing in Bangladesh in&#13;
that sense?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Well, I mean, it's all of the above. It's the question, really, of where you want to put&#13;
the accent and so on. I mean, in terms of transfers I couldn't even tell you what share of the total&#13;
foreign aid we contribute, but, I don't know, 20 percent or so, let's say. We do play a very&#13;
important role in sort of coordinating the activities of the other donors, both in these annual&#13;
meetings and more importantly, perhaps, in the sort of day-to-day operations of the field office in&#13;
Bangladesh. When you go there on your visit, you will, you know, kind of see this. And also&#13;
when you talk to some of the donors, I'm sure they will comment to you on, you know, how&#13;
effective [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The planning commission itself used to do some coordinating of donors. Does it still&#13;
do that?&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: They still do this, and when we have these meetings--I mean, while I was there,&#13;
there was a meeting. We had done a report on food policy--a very good report, incidentally--&#13;
which dealt with all the aspects of food policy. There was a meeting with the donor&#13;
representatives, and, you know, there was also participation by the government. I mean, the food&#13;
secretary was there and the additional secretary of agriculture and some guy, additional secretary&#13;
from the ministry of finance, and then the various donor agencies were there. So this functions&#13;
quite well, and the Bank's role is very important. And the input that we can make thanks to the,&#13;
you know, extensive analytical work that we are doing is something that cannot easily be&#13;
replaced.&#13;
&#13;
I mean, in some of these countries the ADB [Asian-Development Bank] is much larger, of&#13;
course, in terms of lending volumes and transfer of resources. I don't know in Bangladesh again,&#13;
but in Nepal, for instance, you know, the AD B--and the ADB are very aggressive and, you&#13;
know, anxious to pick up a lot of stuff where we would have previously been active. And there&#13;
is, you know, some level of competition even over projects and frequently, you know, kind of&#13;
hassles and problems here. But they don't have, you know, anything like the capacity to, you&#13;
know, analyze the sector situations and so on, let alone the macro side of things. I have the&#13;
feeling that they're beginning to move into this field a little bit. I mean, there have been some&#13;
examples that I've seen where they have sort of tried their hands, but again frequently then they&#13;
would rely on consultants and so on.&#13;
&#13;
So this is a unique and very important role that the Bank plays. And then, yeah sure, I mean,&#13;
through this work there is also very close involvement with the government and, you know:&#13;
what they should do, how they should tackle their problems. I mean, we've done this (as I&#13;
mentioned) this report on the food policy, for instance, which is a crucial area because the hole&#13;
that the food subsidies create in .the budget year after year is phenomenal. And somehow they&#13;
have to find a way of dealing with this thing, and you can not deal with this unless you really&#13;
begin to look critically at the whole question of food pricing, both producer prices and consumer&#13;
prices. And you cannot deal with that without looking at the problem of food distribution and,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
you know, what is happening to the poor and, you know, how do you--and you cannot deal with&#13;
it without looking at the problem of price stabilization and, you know, protecting your producers&#13;
from, you know, all sorts of things to the extent that they really need to be protected. Anyway,&#13;
this report, you know, puts it all very neatly together. And I would hope that from this report&#13;
will flow in the government a consideration of these various options and, you know, the&#13;
beginning of some, some, some changes in this area.&#13;
&#13;
Now, we have a similar thing in the making on the jute industry. And, you know, again, we will&#13;
kind of hope to force people to focus on the issues and deal with these problems and so on and so&#13;
forth. I mean, the thing, of course, that is somewhat frustrating is that when you write these&#13;
reports and when you get into these discussions, you always have the feeling that this is now the&#13;
definitive answer to this particular problem and if we can just move these guys to take the&#13;
necessary action then we can check this off and we will never have to worry about that particular&#13;
element again, we can then tum our attention to something else. Well, this of course is not the&#13;
way things happen, you know. I mean, there will be some remedies that will be introduced, you&#13;
know, some beginning of some reforms but, you know, it is, you know, two, three years later you&#13;
will have to go back and look at it again and see and struggle again and so-but that's, you&#13;
know, why development is not a short term proposition.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, this has been very, very interesting, Jochen, and very helpful, very helpful.&#13;
&#13;
KRASKE: Okay, well, I . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We should try to get to see a copy of that food report, for one thing. We should now, I&#13;
guess, move along. We're going to see one of your colleagues. How do you tum this thing off?&#13;

        <abstracts>
            On November 5, 1991, Jochen Kraske was
            interviewed by the Brookings Institution on behalf of the
            World Bank Group Archives oral history program by John
            Lewis, and Richard Webb. During his tenure at the Bank from
            1964 to 1997, Mr. Kraske worked in the following areas: as a
            young professional (1964); as an economist in the
            departments of South Asia (1965-1966) and Asia (1966-1967);
            as division chief in the departments of East Asia and
            Pacific (EAP), division E (1967-1971), the South Asia,
            division B (1971-1972), South Asia country programs,
            division 2B (1973-1974), and South Asia country programs,
            division A (1974-1975); in New Delhi, India as chief of
            resident mission (1975-1979, 1987-1991), in the eastern
            Africa region country programs department (1979-1987); in
            the South Asia region as director of country department 1
            (1991-1992); and as historian to the World Bank (1993-1997).
            His transcript concerns his work in India. He discusses the
            poor performance yet long-term success of projects in
            Bangladesh, Indian industrial imports credits, and the
            Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
