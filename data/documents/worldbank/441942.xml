I. COUNTRY BACKGROUND AND HURRICANE MITCH&#13;
A.   Background&#13;
1.    Honduras is the third poorest country in the Latin America and Caribbean Region, with&#13;
income per capita of $700 million in 1997, over half of its population in poverty, one third in&#13;
extreme poverty and relatively weak social indicators. Except for two coastal strips, one&#13;
extending about 640 km along the Caribbean Sea and the other 64 km on the Pacific Ocean,&#13;
Honduras is a plateau, consisting of broad, fertile plains broken by deep valleys, and traversed by&#13;
mountain ranges in a northwestern to southwestern direction. The mountains, which are volcanic&#13;
in origin, rise to maximum elevations of more than 2,800 m. Most of the country's rivers drain&#13;
toward the north into the Caribbean Sea. Average annual rainfall ranges from 1,016 mm in some&#13;
mountain valleys to 2,540 mm along the northern coast. Like its neighbors in Central America,&#13;
Honduras, is prone to national disasters, especially hurricanes and earthquakes. Normally, these&#13;
hurricanes affect Honduras' Caribbean coast to the north, as was the case with Hurricane Fifi, in&#13;
September 1974, which caused extensive damage and loss of life in that part of the country.&#13;
2.    On October 24, Tropical Storm Mitch was upgraded to a hurricane that quickly&#13;
developed into one of the strongest and most damaging storms ever to hit Central America. At&#13;
its height on October 26 and 27, Hurricane Mitch sustained winds of 290 kph and dumped heavy&#13;
rains over the region. Although the winds diminished as the hurricane traveled inland over&#13;
Honduras on October 30, the storm continued to produce torrential rains, causing catastrophic&#13;
floods and landslides. After its slow, destructive march north and west across Honduras and&#13;
Guatemala, Mitch dissipated over southeastern Mexico but again gained strength causing&#13;
flooding in Florida. Hurricane Mitch is considered the worst natural disaster to have affected&#13;
Honduras in modern times. Coming after copious winter rains in the previous weeks, which had&#13;
swollen rivers and saturated soils, the hurricane's strong winds and relentless rain caused rivers&#13;
to overflow and severe landslides. The sheer length of time that it remained centered over&#13;
Honduras, combined with its trajectory, resulted in incredibly heavy damage to all parts of the&#13;
country.&#13;
B.   Hurricane Damage&#13;
3.    Within Central America, Honduras bore the brunt of Hurricane Mitch. As the stormn&#13;
traveled inland, it dumped one year's worth of rain in a few days. The worst damage was in the&#13;
Atlantic Coast, Sula Valley, the Central Region and the South, but no part of Honduras escaped&#13;
some impact. Preliminary estimates indicate that about 4.8 million people (three of every four&#13;
Hondurans) were affected. Unlike previous natural disasters, Hurricane Mitch wreaked havoc in&#13;
Honduras' two largest cities, the capital Tegucigalpa, and San Pedro Sula. About 40 percent of&#13;
the capital was damaged, half of its 1 million inhabitants were affected, and the city was cut off&#13;
from the rest of the country for almost a week. Much of the Government's own institutional&#13;
infrastructure was damaged, including destruction of the Ministry of Education and extensive&#13;
damage to the Ministry of Finance. San Pedro Sula, the country's industrial and agricultural&#13;
heartland, suffered damage to its international airport, road and bridge infrastructure, and its&#13;
water and sewerage systems. Estimates of the damage and reconstruction costs were prepared by&#13;
working teams of donor representatives and the authorities, coordinated by the Technical&#13;
Support Unit (UNAT) of the Ministry of the Presidency. IDA staff in Tegucigalpa assisted the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
effort to produce the first damage assessment. A summary of their preliminary estimates is&#13;
presented below.&#13;
* The Human Cost. Preliminary estimates indicate that about 5,660 people died, but there are&#13;
an estimated 8,000 persons missing, suggesting that the total number of deaths could be&#13;
substantially higher. As a direct result of the hurricane, an estimated 285,000 people had to&#13;
be placed in temporary shelters, including about 85,000 children under 5.&#13;
* Transport. Damage to the road network isolated a number of regions in the country,&#13;
including the capital. The hurricane damaged or destroyed an estimated 60 percent of main&#13;
and secondary paved roads (1,600 km), and 20 percent of unpaved secondary and tertiary&#13;
roads (2,390). About 100 bridges (8 in Tegucigalpa) were completely destroyed or suffered&#13;
extensive damage.&#13;
* Water. Water systems in all major urban areas were damaged. In Tegucigalpa, about 23 km&#13;
of the water distribution system were damaged. Damage estimates are still incomplete for&#13;
the rest of the country, but the Government estimates that 47 major water systems and 1,500&#13;
of the 4,000 rural systems were damaged.&#13;
* Energy and Telecommunications. None of the large hydroelectric stations suffered major&#13;
damage, but there was considerable damage to substations, and transmission and distribution&#13;
lines. The hurricane damaged about 45,000 phone lines.&#13;
* Education. The Ministry of Education estimates that 17 percent of the country's 9,548&#13;
primary schools were damaged. This implies that unless school repairs are quickly carried&#13;
out, or alternative arrangements made, about 100,000 children could be unable to start the&#13;
school year in February. About 40 secondary schools were also damaged. In addition, most&#13;
educational establishments not affected by the hurricane are being used as temporary&#13;
shelters. The Ministry of Education building in Tegucigalpa was completely destroyed,&#13;
including all the Ministry's administrative and academic records.&#13;
* Health. The majority of hospitals and health centers suffered some damage. Of Honduras'&#13;
27 hospitals, 14 were left with no water. At least 4 of these reported extensive infrastructure&#13;
damage. Also, 12 hospitals reported damage to their electricity systems. There is little&#13;
information on damage to rural health posts and clinics, but it is believed to be extensive.&#13;
Unsanitary conditions and contaminated water are placing large parts of the population at&#13;
risk of transmitted diseases such as dengue, cholera and leptospirosis.&#13;
* Housing. The Government estimates that the hurricane affected the housing conditions of&#13;
about 661,760 people (82,720 families). Of these, about 285,000 were evacuated to&#13;
temporary shelters and another 396,000 are living in precarious housing. The authorities&#13;
estimate that about 33,220 new houses will be needed and about 49,500 will need to be&#13;
rehabilitated. These estimates are likely to rise considerably, as more information is&#13;
collected from isolated rural areas.&#13;
* Agriculture. Most of the basic grains production was lost. This will severely impact poor,&#13;
small-scale farmers who are the main producers of basic grains. Export products also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
suffered extensive damage, including bananas, shrimp, pineapples, African palm, melons and&#13;
other fruits.&#13;
* Environment. Some ecologists believe that hurricanes are a natural cycle and are necessary&#13;
to thin forests, lower the salinity of coastal waters and scrub underwater reefs and remove&#13;
collected debris and pollution. However, the magnitude of Hurricane Mitch and its impact&#13;
on some of the same places damaged by extensive forest fires last summer, will likely have a&#13;
severe impact on coastal areas and fragile offshore ecosystems. The fires deforested large&#13;
mountain areas, and then-absent the trees and undergrowth-torrential rains caused&#13;
massive erosion.  Small streams became raging torrents that spilled from  their banks.&#13;
carrying with them trees and debris. Thousands of mature trees spilled from the mouths of&#13;
rivers into coastal areas on the Caribbean Sea.&#13;
4.     Preliminary Estimates of Damage and Replacement Costs. A preliminary estimate&#13;
prepared by UNDP and ECLAC (Table 1) suggests total direct and indirect damage of $3.6&#13;
billion (equivalent to 74 percent of Honduras' 1997 GDP). Replacement costs are estimated at&#13;
$5 billion.&#13;

C.    Response to the Hurricane&#13;
5.     After the initial shock over the intensity of Hurricane Mitch, the Government activated&#13;
the National Emergency Commission (CONE), and an Information and Damage Assessment&#13;
Center to coordinate immediate relief efforts and assess damages. CONE and Government teams&#13;
worked with the UN system and emergency response teams from IDA and other donors to&#13;
determine priorities, channel immediate support and coordinate international assistance. The&#13;
Government also put in place mechanisms to provide food and emergency health care to about&#13;
285,000 people in approximately 1,000 shelters, much of this with active help from relief&#13;
agencies, other Governments and Honduras' own private sector.  In terms of transport&#13;
infrastructure, both the Northern corridor between San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
Southern corridor between Choluteca and Tegucigalpa were reopened (in some cases using&#13;
temporary solutions such as Bailey bridges, or temporary routes around bridges and across the&#13;
dryer sectors of river beds) within about a week, reestablishing some road communications&#13;
between the capital and parts of the country, and enabling the shipment of food, fuel and&#13;
emergency materials to get to the capital. Water service is being reestablished gradually in the&#13;
capital and major cities using temporary solutions, such as local wells, and the Government is&#13;
trying to acquire materials for the most urgent repairs to the primary and secondary distribution&#13;
networks. The Government is also working with the Panamerican Health Organization to&#13;
implement a massive vaccination campaign, rehabilitate basic health services and implement a&#13;
vector control program.&#13;
6.    The international community responded swiftly to the disaster, benefitting from the&#13;
emergency response capability of the U.N. and a number of countries. The primary focus was on&#13;
rescuing communities, establishing communications, distributing emergency food and medicines&#13;
to affected communities, and organizing shelters for displaced populations. There was also a&#13;
major task of disposing of the dead, both human and animals, to prevent the spread of disease.&#13;
IDA staff on the ground in Honduras moved quickly to help the Government coordinate with&#13;
other donors and conduct a preliminary damage assessment.  IDA also reallocated and&#13;
restructured existing operations, prepared supplemental credits, and quickly disbursed the second&#13;
tranche of the Public Sector Modernization Adjustment Credit and its associated Fifth Dimension&#13;
resources (totaling $38 million), which provided much-needed balance of payments support.&#13;
11. ECONOMIC IMPACT OF HURRICANE MITCH&#13;
A.   Macroeconomic Framework Prior to the Hurricane&#13;
7.    Until Hurricane Mitch struck, Honduras' economy had been improving steadily during&#13;
the previous two years. Economic growth had rebounded to 4.9 percent in 1997, from 3.7&#13;
percent i-n 1996, and was on pace for growth of 5.5 percent in 1998. Average real wages had&#13;
increased by about 8 percent in 1997, after no growth the previous two years, and while&#13;
underemployment remained significant, open unemployment had fallen slightly to 4 percent in&#13;
1997, Annualized inflation fell from 26 percent in 1997 to 13 percent in September 1998.&#13;
8.    The consolidated public sector deficit fell to 3 percent of GDP in 1997, from 4.2 percent&#13;
in 1996, while public savings increased slightly to 6.1 percent of GDP. In April 1998, the&#13;
Government adopted a fiscal package aimed at increasing social spending and promoting private&#13;
investment through lower income tax rates to bring them in line with the rest of Central America,&#13;
and the phasing out of the net assets tax and export taxes. To meet the fiscal costs associated&#13;
with the increased spending and tax reductions, the sales tax rate was increased from 7 to 12&#13;
percent. Preliminary data for the first nine months of 1998 indicated that fiscal performance was&#13;
in line with a fiscal deficit target of 2.5 percent of GDP.&#13;
9.    The current account deficit fell from 4.6 percent of GDP in 1996 to 2.7 percent in 1997.&#13;
In the first nine months of 1998, merchandise exports in dollar terms increased by an estimated&#13;
20 percent relative to the same period in 1997, mainly due to strong growth in coffee and&#13;
nontraditional exports. Merchandise imports also grew strongly, and the current account deficit&#13;
was projected to fall slightly to 2.4 percent of GDP in 1998. Gross international reserves&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
increased from $476 million at end-1997 to $515 million at end-September 1998, but fell slightly&#13;
in terms of months of imports.&#13;
10.   The Governnent was also making steady progress in its structural reform program. This&#13;
included: approval of the Telecommunications Law and the Law for Concessioning of Airport&#13;
Services in late 1995, which authorized the privatization strategy for these two sectors;,&#13;
presentation to the Assembly of the new Civil Aviation Law, which provides a modem&#13;
framework for the development of the sector; approval of a new tariff structure for electricity in&#13;
1995 and tariff adjustments in 1996 and 1997; approval of the amendments to the General Public&#13;
Administration Law in December 1996, which provided the framework for restructuring of&#13;
public sector entities; a 14 percent reduction in public employment positions;ad e    e   in&#13;
public management, such as decentralization of the procurement function.&#13;
11.  In April 1998, the Assembly approved legislation establishing a single regulatory agency&#13;
for the electricity sector (a key requirement for establishing a tariff policy consistent with long-&#13;
run marginal costs and for facilitating privatization). In August, the Government approved a&#13;
strategy for the privatization of electricity distribution, and in September a decree permitting the&#13;
start of the bidding process for the privatization of the telecoms company, HONDUTEL, was&#13;
passed. The decree complemented the previously-approved privatization law, by strengthening&#13;
transparency and accountability provisions in the privatization process to be followed. In late&#13;
October, the Government sent to the Assembly draft legislation that would permit concessions to&#13;
the private sector for the construction and management of infrastructure projects and encourage&#13;
private investment in the mining sector. Measures were also adopted during 1998 to strengthen&#13;
the regulatory framework of the financial sector. Prudential banking regulations were issued on&#13;
capital adequacy, loan classification requirements, connected lending, and limits on external&#13;
borrowing. Other regulations were being prepared to limit the open foreign exchange positions&#13;
of commercial banks, establish a deposit insurance system, and regulate the operations of the&#13;
stock exchange, insurance companies, and voluntary private pension funds.&#13;
B.    Economic Impact&#13;
12.   Estimates of the damage to the economy are still being refined. The Authorities estimate&#13;
that real GDP growth could drop to 3 percent in 1998 (this modest decrease is because the&#13;
hurricane struck late in the calendar year), but would turn negative by at least 2-3 percent in&#13;
1999, compared with projected annual growth of 5-6 percent prior to the hurricane.&#13;
Unemployment is likely to rise substantially as workers are being laid off in agriculture and&#13;
manufacturing pending the reactivation of production. Inflation is expected to increase to 16&#13;
percent by December 1998 (13 percent through October) and about 18 percent by end-1999, due&#13;
to the relaxation of emergency price controls and shortages of food and other goods. Pre-Mitch&#13;
estimates projected a decline in inflation from 15 percent in 1998 to about 10 percent in 1999.&#13;
13.   Preliminary estimates indicate that the overall deficit of the Central Government could&#13;
widen to 4 percent of GDP in 1998 and to 8 percent or more in 1999, from 2.5 percent projected&#13;
prior to the hurricane. The higher deficit would be financed largely by external grants and&#13;
credits. Central Government current revenue (excluding grants) is expected to fall to 16.7&#13;
percent of GDP in 1998 and 14.4 percent in 1999, compared with about 17.7 percent projected&#13;
prior to the hurricane. This would reflect mainly the impact of lower growth on revenues from&#13;
the income, sales, and petroleum taxes. Import duties are also expected to fall due to damage to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
customs posts, and temporary duty exemptions on imports of food, raw materials, and equipment&#13;
to support the rehabilitation and reconstruction effort. Primary expenditures of the Central&#13;
Government are expected to increase by 3 percentage points of GDP in 1998 and 4 percentage&#13;
points in 1999, relative to levels contemplated in the budget, due to additional spending&#13;
requirements related to emergency relief, and reconstruction needs.&#13;

14.    Commercial banks and other financial institutions are expected to be affected by&#13;
hurricane-related losses experienced by major borrowers, that will require the restructuring of&#13;
some loans and write-offs of others. An assessment of the losses and measures to deal with them&#13;
is being carried out by the Banking Commission, with the assistance of the IMF and IDA. At&#13;
this time, the Central Bank is not considering special lines of credit to the banks to deal with the&#13;
effects of the disaster, but is encouraging the banks to deal with their clients on a case-by-case.&#13;
The Government is discussing with NGOs and the agriculture development bank (BANADESA)&#13;
mechanisms to support the reestablishment of rural credit schemes.&#13;
15.    The current account deficit is expected to widen to about 8 percent of GDP in 1998 and&#13;
in 1999 (compared to under 3 percent estimated prior to Mitch), owing mainly to the projected&#13;
fall in exports and higher imports associated with the reconstruction effort and the rebuilding of&#13;
inventories. Rough estimates indicate a financing gap of about $500 million (about 10 percent of&#13;
GDP) in 1999. The estimate for 1999 takes into account about $290 million in insurance&#13;
proceeds (to Honduran insurance companies reinsured outside the country), but excludes the&#13;
effects of possible flow rescheduling of obligations coming due to Paris Club creditors. The&#13;
Government expects to fill the 1999 financing gap through the reprogramming of existing credits&#13;
(mainly from IDA and IDB), disbursements of new grants and credits, emergency balance of&#13;
payments support from IDA and the IMF, and further debt relief, including disbursements under&#13;
the recently-established Central America Emergency Trust Fund (CAETF) to cover the servicing&#13;
of multilateral debt.&#13;
C. Government Measures&#13;
16.   The Government is taking steps to limit the effects of the disaster on inflation and interest&#13;
rates, and setting the stage for economic recovery. A revised Central Government budget for&#13;
1999 is being prepared to take account of the changed outlook for revenues and expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
The Government aims to limit domestic financing to about 1 percent of GDP in 1998-99, in part&#13;
by reallocating spending to emergency needs and seeking concessional financing and grants to&#13;
meet its reconstruction needs. Monetary policy will aim to limit inflation by containing the&#13;
growth of the money supply. In the external sector, the Government will aim to maintain&#13;
confidence in the exchange rate system by continuing to hold regular auctions, allowing the&#13;
exchange rate to fluctuate within the band, and maintaining a minimum level of gross&#13;
international reserves equivalent to about 3 months of imports.&#13;
17.   On the structural front, the calendar for privatization of the telecoms company and the&#13;
electricity sector, as well as the concessioning of airports, are under review, pending a full&#13;
assessment of damages and the rehabilitation needs. IFC is discussing with the Government&#13;
possible support to keep the privatization of the telecoms company on track. The Banking&#13;
Commission will maintain close supervision over the financial system, in particular by&#13;
continuing with its program of on-site supervision supported by IDA and the IMF, and assessing&#13;
the effects of the disaster on loan portfolios and insurance companies, some of which have been&#13;
seriously affected by the hurricane damage.&#13;
18.   The Government plans to resume discussions in mid-January 1999, aimed at finalizing an&#13;
economic program that could be supported by an ESAF. The Authorities believe that an ESAF-&#13;
supported program, aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, improving the climate for&#13;
foreign investors, and deepening structural reforms, would be essential to restore confidence in&#13;
the economy and support the recovery. They also see this as an essential step toward Honduras'&#13;
eventual inclusion under the HIPC initiative.&#13;
III. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
A.   IDA Strategy&#13;
19.   At the time the hurricane struck, IDA had its Central America transport team, a mission&#13;
working with the IMF on the debt sustainability analysis and the Policy Framework Paper (PFP),&#13;
and the staff of its Liaison Office in Tegucigalpa. They formed the core of IDA's emergency&#13;
response team, supplemented by disaster specialists and other task managers who traveled to the&#13;
country as soon as physical conditions permitted. Immediate needs included helping the&#13;
Government to assess damage, prioritize interventions, and coordinate with other external&#13;
donors. This effort has included IFC staff, who have been coordinating with the country team in&#13;
headquarters, and have traveled to Honduras to review with the Government and the private&#13;
sector ways to assist them deal with the effects of the hurricane, and possible support to keep the&#13;
Government's privatization program on track. FIAS is also discussing with the Government&#13;
possible support for a foreign investment promotion strategy, and MIGA has indicated its&#13;
willingness to work closely with the Government to help in mobilizing private investment for the&#13;
recovery and reconstruction. In the process, IDA has prepared its own three-part strategy to&#13;
assist Honduras respond to this natural disaster.&#13;
* Emergency Financing, Macroeconomic Assistance and Debt Relief. The Government has&#13;
an urgent need for emergency financing of critical imports, while sustaining macroeconomic&#13;
stability. The proposed fast-track Hurricane Emergency Project (HEP) would meet this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
immediate need. It complements actions by IDA in the two weeks following the hurricane to&#13;
release the second tranche of the Public Sector Modernization Adjustment Credit and&#13;
associated Fifth Dimension resources, which also provided balance of payments support at a&#13;
critical juncture. Considering the emergency in Honduras, the Board approved that action on&#13;
a no-objection basis in three days, rather than the standard ten. IDA staff have also been&#13;
cooperating with the IMF on a preliminary reassessment of Honduras' macroeconomic&#13;
situation. Finally, at the request of a several governments, IDA has established a Central&#13;
America Emergency Trust Fund (CAETF) to which contributions are being made to support&#13;
Honduras, and other hurricane-affected countries cover multilateral debt service payments.&#13;
As soon as conditions permit, IDA and the IMF, in consultation with the IDB, will carry out&#13;
a comprehensive debt sustainability analysis which would determine Honduras' eligibility for&#13;
the HIPC initiative.&#13;
* Short- to Medium-Term  Rehabilitation.  IDA  staff are working with counterpart&#13;
Government agencies and other development partners to reprogram IDA operations and/or&#13;
process supplemental financing to provide for urgent rehabilitation of damaged social and&#13;
economic infrastructure. Given the extent of the damage and the need for quick support,&#13;
IDA staff believe that reprogramming of the existing portfolio-as opposed to designing a&#13;
new, multi-sector hurricane rehabilitation project-is the fastest and most flexible way to&#13;
meet Honduras' short-term rehabilitation needs, given that speed is of the essence. Based on&#13;
preliminary damage estimates, we anticipate that several ongoing IDA operations would be&#13;
restructured within existing credit amounts to finance about $70 million of rehabilitation-&#13;
related expenditures. In addition, supplemental funding will be proposed for ongoing health&#13;
and transport projects, in the amounts of $10 and $20, respectively. These figures may&#13;
change as work with Government counterparts and other donors continues and as medium-&#13;
term rehabilitation needs are better defined.&#13;
L Longer-Term Reconstruction. A new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was under&#13;
preparation at the time that Hurricane Mitch struck Honduras. Up to that point, IDA had held&#13;
CAS discussions in which it had agreed with the Government on the primary objectives and&#13;
likely lending and non-lending services. It had also initiated a dialogue with representatives&#13;
of civil society and was about to formalize the consultation process on the proposed CAS,&#13;
which was scheduled to be presented to the Board in February 1999. The new CAS under&#13;
preparation did not propose a major change with respect to the strategy of the previous CAS,&#13;
but rather a shift in emphasis, placing greater focus on human capital, targeted poverty&#13;
interventions, rural development, environment, and institutional strengthening. In the social&#13;
sectors, discussions were well advanced on IDA support to pilot a community-based&#13;
education model (along the successful EDUCO model in El Salvador) and improved health&#13;
care quality through decentralization. The social safety net would also be strengthened by&#13;
supporting successful pilot initiatives by the Social Investment Fund targeting women,&#13;
indigenous groups, municipal strengthening and rural credit. In rural development, we were&#13;
working with the Government on a broad agenda to support rural growth and poverty&#13;
alleviation, including support for land titling, a land fund and an assessment of options in the&#13;
design of a viable rural credit system to benefit small, poor farmers. On the environment, we&#13;
planned to complement work under the GEF-funded Meso-American Biological Corridor&#13;
project with an operation to protect the Coral Reef, and as part of a regional initiative, had&#13;
planned work on disaster prevention and mitigation. Institutional strengthening would be an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
over-riding objective, including support for improved governance and transparency,&#13;
decentralization and strengthening of local governments, and economic management. In&#13;
terms of structural reforms, we had started work with the Central Bank on strengthening the&#13;
prudential regulation and supervision of the financial system, and support for pension reform.&#13;
20.   The extent of the economic and social devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch calls for a&#13;
fundamental review of Honduras' future development strategy. While long-term development&#13;
objectives of poverty reduction, sustainable and equitable private sector-led growth,&#13;
environmental protection, strengthening of the financial system, and modernization of the state&#13;
may not have changed, the pace and sequencing efforts in all sectors have necessarily been&#13;
affected by the hurricane. Therefore, the draft CAS will need to be reformulated to support the&#13;
longer-term reconstruction of Honduras. While the priorities on which we were working are&#13;
likely to remain valid, and we propose that IDA remain heavily engaged in the social sectors and&#13;
rural poverty, issues that will have to be addressed include the possible need to direct a larger&#13;
volume of resources toward infrastructure rehabilitation, especially transport and water&#13;
(depending on the support forthcoming from other donors), and toward work on the financial&#13;
system and private sector development. The share of the country program devoted to quick-&#13;
disbursing balance of payments support will also necessarily increase beginning with the&#13;
proposed HEP. Strengthening the country's institutional capacity for disaster preparedness and&#13;
management will be very important, and the emphasis on decentralization and local partnerships&#13;
which is already a strong feature of our portfolio will become more important than even in the&#13;
recovery process. Finally, the role of other parts of the Bank Group in supporting private sector&#13;
development is likely to expand.&#13;
B.    Project Objectives&#13;
21.   The proposed Hurricane Emergency Project is part of the first phase of IDA's strategy to&#13;
assist in the recovery and reconstruction of Honduras (para. 19). It would assist the Government&#13;
in maintaining macroeconomic stability through financing of imports associated with rebuilding&#13;
social and economic infrastructure, and reestablishing production levels in response to the&#13;
damage caused by Hurricane Mitch. The performance of the project would be measured by how&#13;
well Honduras maintains macroeconomic stability in 1999 and beyond, especially in terms of the&#13;
current account deficit and the budget deficit of the Central Government.&#13;
C.    Project Description&#13;
22.   The Hurricane Emergency Project will provide immediate, quick-disbursing support to&#13;
finance a positive list of imports needed for the rehabilitation effort while supporting&#13;
macroeconomic objectives. While the proposed credit would be entirely quick-disbursing, it is&#13;
only one part of an unbundled set of actions by the Bank Group to respond to the effects of the&#13;
hurricane. The project will, inter alia, provide assistance for imports of: (i) construction&#13;
materials and equipment, water, land and air transport vehicles, petroleum, and fuel products that&#13;
are needed for rehabilitation of physical infrastructure; (ii) seeds, fertilizers, agricultural&#13;
equipment, materials, machinery and fuel needed to reestablish agricultural production; (iii)&#13;
medical supplies and equipment needed to replenish stocks of hospitals, health centers, health&#13;
posts and outreach programs; (iv) school supplies and equipment for educational facilities that&#13;
were damaged or destroyed; and (v) machinery, spare parts and equipment for commercial and&#13;
industrial companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
23.   The size of the proposed credit at SDR 144.3 million ($200 million equivalent) is based&#13;
on the Government's request for emergency assistance and an assessment of the adverse effects&#13;
of Hurricane Mitch on the balance of payments after taking account of the assistance expected&#13;
from the IMF, IDB, and other donors.&#13;
IV. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS/PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.   Project Organization and Management&#13;
24.   Project implementation arrangements have been streamlined to conform to the emergency&#13;
nature of IDA's assistance. In addressing IDA's fiduciary responsibilities, IDA has sought to&#13;
ensure that: credit proceeds are administered prudently, and only used to finance imports of&#13;
items included on the positive list; required procurement, accounting and auditing procedures are&#13;
followed, and appropriate retention of documents is provided to allow for IDA supervision and&#13;
independent audits.&#13;
25.   The Project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance, with the assistance of the&#13;
Central Bank of Honduras. The execution of an Implementation Agreement, satisfactory to IDA,&#13;
defining the assistance to be provided by the Central Bank of Honduras is a condition of&#13;
effectiveness. The Ministry of Finance will provide the basic information on imports (based on&#13;
Customs Declarations) and the National Division of Customs will maintain the respective&#13;
supporting documentation. The credit will finance 100 percent of the delivered cost of eligible&#13;
imports, excluding import duties and taxes, subject to a positive list agreed with Government&#13;
(Attachment 1). The Central Bank will prepare Statements of Expenditure in an agreed format&#13;
based on the information received from the Ministry of Finance through its National Division of&#13;
Customs.&#13;
B.   Procurement&#13;
26.   Credit proceeds would be made available to finance public and private sector imports&#13;
against documentation evidencing that the imported goods were both on the positive list and&#13;
procured following agreed procurement procedures. Imports financed with credit proceeds&#13;
would be limited to goods from eligible countries as per the Bank's Procurement Guidelines&#13;
(Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated January 1995, revised&#13;
January and August 1996, and September 1997). No more than 50 percent of the credit would be&#13;
used to finance the import of any category of eligible imports on the positive list. In order to&#13;
avoid excessive transaction costs for IDA, public and private sector import contracts of less than&#13;
$20,000 would not be eligible for financing with credit proceeds.&#13;
27.   The credit would be used to finance only imports procured in accordance with the&#13;
procedures presented in Table 3 below. All procurement of imports by the private sector of $3&#13;
million or above will be based on Simplified International Competitive Bidding Procedures&#13;
subject to prior review by IDA. Imports by the private sector less than the equivalent of $3&#13;
million will be acquired based on established commercial practices and will not need the prior&#13;
review of IDA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28.   Public sector imports financed under this project would follow Simplified International&#13;
Competitive Bidding procedures, as provided under IDA's Procurement Guidelines (Clauses&#13;
2.63 and 2.64). Contracts let by the public sector of $1 million or above will be subject to prior&#13;
review by IDA. However, to facilitate the speedy import of items required immediately for the&#13;
recovery effort, public sector imports of less than $1 million equivalent and awarded between&#13;
October 25, 1998 and June 30, 1999 may be made based on international shopping procedures as&#13;
per IDA's Procurement Guidelines (Clauses 3.5 and 3.6). The Project would finance the import&#13;
of fuel and fertilizers by both private and public importers through established international&#13;
commodity markets, or through simplified procurement procedures provided for under the IDA's&#13;
Procurement Guidelines.&#13;

C.   Disbursements&#13;
29.   The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed against 100 percent of the delivered cost of&#13;
imports, excluding imports duties and taxes, subject to the agreed positive list.  Mo&#13;
disbursements would be made for used or luxury goods, or for military equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
Disbursements in respect of expenditures under contracts for goods procured by the public sector&#13;
costing less than $1 million equivalent and under contracts for goods for the private sector&#13;
costing less than $3 million equivalent and for commonly traded commodities would be made&#13;
against Statements of Expenditures, for which supporting documentation would be retained by&#13;
the National Division of Customs and made available for review by IDA financial management&#13;
and procurement specialists and project auditors. The project would be implemented over a one-&#13;
year period and is expected to be completed by December 31. 1999. The Closing Date for this&#13;
credit would be June 30, 2000.&#13;
30.   Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing in the amount of SDR 28.86 million, 20&#13;
percent of the credit amount, would be provided to finance expenditures incurred before loan&#13;
signing but after October 24, 1998. the approximate date of onset of devastation caused by&#13;
Hurricane Mitch.&#13;
31.   Special Account. The Borrower may request disbursement through a US Dollar Special&#13;
Account to be established in the Central Bank of Honduras, with an initial authorized allocation&#13;
of $50 million, 25 percent of the total credit amount. The Special Account would be replenished&#13;
as and when needed to ensure timely disbursements of funds to cover eligible imports.&#13;
D.    Financial Management and Monitoring&#13;
32.   The Central Bank of Honduras has in place an appropriate mechanism to monitor and&#13;
report on the financial transactions pertaining to this operation. The Ministry of Finance would&#13;
provide at all times adequate staff for managing the Project and maintaining proper accounts and&#13;
records. The Central Bank will prepare quarterly reports on the financial transactions related to&#13;
the project within such period. Such reports will be provided to the Ministry of Finance within&#13;
15 days of the end of each quarter. The quarterly financial reports will reflect the total transfers&#13;
of resources of the credit and show the total of eligible financed imports based on the agreed&#13;
positive list (corresponding to the lists of imports provided by the National Division of&#13;
Customs).&#13;
33.   Quarterly progress reports of monitoring indicators, the Project's financial transactions,&#13;
and quarterly audits of project accounts, the Special Account and Statements of Expenditures by&#13;
an independent private accounting firm acceptable to IDA, will be provided by the Ministry of&#13;
Finance within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter. The fourth quarter audit report will&#13;
present the cumulative balances to the end of the year. The retaining of an auditing firm&#13;
acceptable to IDA is a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
34.   The Project's monitoring indicators are described in Attachment 2. Quarterly reports on&#13;
the progress against these macroeconomic indicators will be prepared and sent to IDA within 30&#13;
days of the close of each quarter.&#13;

Monitoring Indicators&#13;
The objective of the Hurricane Emergency Project is to assist the Republic of Honduras&#13;
to finance critical imports needed for the rehabilitation and rebuilding effort while maintaining&#13;
macroeconomic stability. The following preliminary indicators would be used to monitor&#13;
macroeconomic stability:&#13;
* The balance of payments current account deficit expected not to exceed 8 percent of GDP in&#13;
1999; and&#13;
The overall fiscal deficit of the Central Government expected not to exceed 8 percent of GDP&#13;
in 1999.&#13;
These indicators would be adjusted accordingly, as macroeconomic estimates and projections&#13;
are refined, as reflected in the subsequent Government economic program.&#13;

            Honduras - Hurricane Emergency Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Hurricane Emergency Project assists
            Honduras in maintaining macroeconomic stability by financing
            imports associated with rebuilding social and economic
            infrastructure and by re-establishing production levels. It
            is an integral part of a broader set of the International
            Development Association's (IDA) efforts to help
            Nicaragua respond to the effects of Hurricane Mitch. The
            project provides immediate, quick-disbursing credit to
            support the purchase of 1) construction materials and
            equipment as well as water, land and air transport vehicles,
            petroleum, and fuel products needed for rehabilitating
            physical infrastructure; 2) seeds, fertilizers, and
            agricultural equipment along with materials, machinery, and
            fuel needed to reestablish agricultural production; 3)
            medical supplies and equipment needed to replenish
            stockpiles in hospitals, health centers, health posts, and
            outreach programs; 4) school supplies and equipment for
            educational facilities that were damaged or destroyed; and
            5) machinery, spare parts, and equipment for commercial and
            industrial companies.
