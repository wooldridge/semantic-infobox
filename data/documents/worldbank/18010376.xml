&#13;
Q: Good morning! It is January 18th, 2001, and I'm William Becker with the Business&#13;
History Group and the George Washington University.&#13;
&#13;
Q: I'm Marie Zenni, task manager ofthe Oral History Program.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: And I'm Richard Stem, late ofthe World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Very good. Mr. Stem, it's very good to see you. And we'd like to start with some questions&#13;
about your background, and the first is where did you receive your higher education?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: My first degree was at the University of Southampton in England. It was ajoint&#13;
degree; half politics and half applied economics. That was in the mid-'60s. And then, after that, I&#13;
went as a volunteer to Ethiopia with the UN. I'll talk about that later. But then I came back and&#13;
went to Sussex for my master's degree, which was in development economics.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Were there early experiences that influenced your later career?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yes. The most critical and the most formative experience, I guess, in my life in terms&#13;
ofthe development field was when I went to Ethiopia as a volunteer. In the last year of my first&#13;
degree, I had several interviews with established corporations and firms. I decided I wasn't&#13;
interested in them, and they decided they weren't interested in me. So I volunteered and went,&#13;
just by chance, to Ethiopia and just by chance to work with the UN. I ended up working in the&#13;
UN development office in Ethiopia. I had two main responsibilities: one, administering training&#13;
programs for Ethiopians overseas given by the UN system, but probably far more formative and&#13;
interesting in terms of my own career and philosophical development was my second&#13;
responsibility: supporting training programs for Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia. So at the end of&#13;
that period it was almost natural that I would move into the development field. I came back to&#13;
Sussex and got a serious education in development. So I did it sort of back to front. I got the&#13;
practical experience before the academic one. Actually, I think that helped me tremendously in&#13;
later life. I'll come to that later. I think this unique combination of hands-on experience in the&#13;
field and then putting it into some sort of theoretical construct was incredibly helpful.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What drew you to consider working for the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It was a number of issues. The Bank, even at that time, was considered to be the&#13;
preeminent institution in the field of both development theory and practice. Secondly, I happened&#13;
to get to know Moody Burney, who was, I think, the Bank's first representative to Ethiopia, who&#13;
I met once or twice and encouraged me to apply. And then the YP [young professionals]&#13;
Program was a well known program. So it was really just a natural to go in that direction. When I&#13;
was at Sussex, my second year was financed through a studentship from ODA at that time--the&#13;
Overseas Development Administration--so I was actually obligated under that program to go&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Richard D. Stern&#13;
                              January 18 and 19,2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and, I guess, work in the developing countries, with the expectation that it would be under&#13;
British aid, but they saw the move to the Bank as being consistent with that. And I think I&#13;
actually asked them for permission to do that when I got accepted by the YP Program.&#13;
&#13;
Q: When did you join the YP Program?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: November '70. I was in the seventh or eighth class ofthe YPs. So the program had&#13;
been running for a fair bit of time. Some of the earlier YPs had become division chiefs by then,&#13;
but no one had become director or VP at that time.&#13;
&#13;
Q: At that time, could you describe the nature of the training you received in the program?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: The YP Program has gone through several phases of"Should we train? Shouldn't we&#13;
train? Should it just be 'hands-on' experience?" And it has never really solved that dilemma.&#13;
&#13;
The early YPs, ifi recall correctly, all joined on the same day, or close to the same day. They&#13;
had a two or three week orientation. And they did sort of stay together as a group. By the time I&#13;
had joined, that had disappeared. We just participated in the same two or three day orientation&#13;
that all employees had when they joined the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
You should also remember that I joined the Bank during a period of rapid expansion. Just after I&#13;
joined, the YP intake was doubled. The Bank was expanding so fast that we just basically threw&#13;
everybody into the deep end. You got a lot of hands-on training, on the job experience, but not&#13;
any formal training to speak of. In later years we put back more formal training, but the honest&#13;
answer is that we never thought about it much at that time.&#13;
&#13;
One of my biggest worries when I joined the Bank was wondering whether I'd come to the right&#13;
place. It was a very conservative institution. The YPs that joined with me, I thought, were an&#13;
incredibly conservative bunch of people. Now, we've got to remember it was the end ofthe '60s.&#13;
Most of us--wells at least anybody I thought was sensible--had been on the streets demonstrating&#13;
throughout the '60s. Most of the YPs didn't come from that crowd. I was very much a part of&#13;
that crowd.&#13;
&#13;
I remember there was something called the Five-thirty Club, which was--well, it tells you about&#13;
when we finished work in those days!--formed by a group ofYPs, I guess a couple of years&#13;
earlier. Typically Â·they invited senior members of staff to talk to them about important topical&#13;
issues. Now, in some sense it was good because there was some filling the gaps in the training&#13;
that didn't exist for them, but in other respects it was very much listening to senior&#13;
management-somewhat ingratiating, I guess, in terms of making themselves known to senior&#13;
management! They all had suits and short hair, and my hair was do\\-n to my shoulders. I only&#13;
went to one or two of these meetings, and I didn't like them. But I remember it was right after the&#13;
annual meetings in Copenhagen, I think it was in 1970, and that was the first meeting that we had&#13;
demonstrations on the street against the Bank, and William Clark, who was the vice president for&#13;
external relations, was describing the antics of the demonstrators and belittling their ideas. The&#13;
condescension of the YPs toward these demonstrators (many ofwhich became mainstream Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Richard D. Stern&#13;
                              January 18 and 19,2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
thinking in recent years) was just palpable. And I was just sitting there wondering who are these&#13;
YPs and why was I there. So it was a very different place at that time.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, how did this experience with the YP Program influence your later career?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Oh, it was incredibly important! I guess in two main respects. One, as a YP, even&#13;
though you weren't given formal training, you were given time to evolve and develop. People&#13;
were pleasantly surprised if you could give some serious professional input in the assignments&#13;
you got. But there was a sort of a paternalistic ambiance and view by your supervisors that you&#13;
could say a few outrageous things. If you made mistakes, you were tolerated, which the non-YPs&#13;
were not as they were expected to contribute in their professional area of expertise immediately.&#13;
So that space or room, if you like, I think was incredibly important. A lot of my non-YP&#13;
contemporaries felt tremendous pressure to produce right away, and I think in the end that&#13;
constricted their development and evolution as broad-based development professionals within&#13;
their area of specialization.&#13;
&#13;
Let me expand on this. If you think about it, you can locate better experts in any particular field&#13;
outside the Bank. In many respects, the Bank decapitalizes you in terms of your core&#13;
professional competence. However, what is unique to the Bank is the multidisciplinary view&#13;
which no other institution really has. A bank makes a loan, but it doesn't do all the thinking. The&#13;
YPs in those days were thus able to become--because they moved between various assignments,&#13;
because they were given time to mature and develop--evolve and embody the core competence&#13;
of the Bank, whereas, some of the people who came in as technical specialists who were&#13;
perfectly capable of potentially evolving into those broader people didn't do it! And I think that&#13;
was incredibly important.&#13;
&#13;
The other unique advantage that YPs had as a result of the rotational assignments was to be able&#13;
to accumulate different experiences very quickly. So, I started off on East Pakistan and then onto&#13;
water and rural infrastructure and then moved into East Africa.&#13;
&#13;
In those days all staff received much more mentoring and coaching that they do now. Managers&#13;
had time to do it, particularly in the early and critical formative years of new staff. And I was just&#13;
very, very lucky. I had three people who influenced me tremendously. One was Ping Loh, who&#13;
was my second division chief, and he taught me the importance of being practical and practicing&#13;
the "art of the possible" with clients. And then there was Stanley Please, who was one of the first&#13;
broad based thinkers in the Bank, passionate about the importance of country policy and the&#13;
limits ofthe project approach. In fact, when we worked together in Tanzania, we did one ofthe&#13;
first Bank program loans. It was a precursor of some of the things we did under structural&#13;
adjustment ten years later. We didn't do it very well, but it was the beginning. Well, I'm&#13;
exaggerating a bit. And then we did the ones to India, but they were basically check-writing. I&#13;
mean, we didn't spend a lot of time talking about economic policy and structural change. The&#13;
India ones were largely balance of payments support--! wasn't involved in them--but they weren't&#13;
backed up by serious economic analysis, and then the more sectoral stuff that we did later on the&#13;
structural adjustment loans. We started to try and do that in Tanzania, and Stanley was just&#13;
incredibly important in giving that point of perspective. He was a pioneer in that respect in the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Richard D. Stern&#13;
                               January 18 and 19, 2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then there was my third mentor, Shahid Husain, who was willing to combine Ping's and&#13;
Stanley's perspective and take the risks to do it. I was just lucky enough in my first three or four&#13;
years to work with them. And they were very supportive, but also again, as I said, giving&#13;
you the space to make mistakes.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, one of the objectives of the program was to provide a cadre ofwell trained young&#13;
professionals who would look towards a long career in middle or senior management in the&#13;
Bank. Obviously that's worked in your experience. Do you think overall that objective has been&#13;
achieved?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, it has, as a matter of fact, because I think since about the early 1980s at least&#13;
fifty percent of our senior managers came through the YP Program. The numbers bounce a little&#13;
bit, but I think the proportion of YPs in middle management is now around 60, 65 percent,&#13;
something like that. So the program has done that. Whether we selected the right people in the&#13;
first place and gave them the right training and experiences to prepare them for management is,&#13;
of course, another matter. Until the last ten years or so the only people who could easily move&#13;
across the Bank were YPs. But even that was fairly limited at the middle levels and didn't change&#13;
until the mid-80s when some of the attitudinal barriers started to break down.&#13;
&#13;
I was, I think, only the first or second staff member to move from a program department to a&#13;
project department at a managerial level, and it caused a lot of ruckus at the time. It was when I&#13;
moved from the Indonesia division to the Telecom Division. The Bank had sort of talked about&#13;
these things that we needed to do that if we were going to create a true integrated management&#13;
cadre, but no one had actually done it. I remember at the time I actually got a fair bit of support&#13;
from Ernie [Ernest] Stem and a few others who were quite comfortable in my doing that, but&#13;
these decisions were made by the department directors at that time--I mean the appointment of&#13;
division chiefs. And I remember I went for several interviews in East Africa and West Africa and&#13;
a couple of other places with directors who were just looking for excuses. They couldn't argue&#13;
that I hadn't done well. But they were just looking for excuses about why you couldn't move&#13;
someone from a more generalist country function to a project function. And it was only because&#13;
Hans Fuchs, Director of the Industry Department, who was prepared to take the risk, that I&#13;
became Chief of the Telecommunications Division.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Do you think the original formula is still relevant today, in view of the professionals&#13;
moving around from one profession to another in their careers?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, I would go back to what you think is the core competency of the Bank. As you&#13;
know, we clearly are in trouble in some areas because we can't provide, or are having difficulty&#13;
in providing, state-of-the-art advice to increasingly sophisticated clients. So don't get me wrong!&#13;
I'm not arguing for a minute that the Bank doesn't have to do that. But I also think that the&#13;
unique contribution of the Bank is its ability to take an interdisciplinary approach so you can put&#13;
that expert advice in that context. And having a management cadre that is able to internalize that,&#13;
having a management cadre that has got enough experience at the broad macro level and enough&#13;
hands-on experience at the sector, thematic and project level to be able to make the vital&#13;
linkages, to be confident enough to conduct a credible dialogue with senior government officials&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Richard D. Stern&#13;
                              January 18 and 19,2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
is centraL That, I think, is extremely important. And it doesn't have to be YPs, but it's got to be&#13;
people who have been able to move around the Bank and development more generally.&#13;
&#13;
One of the things that we are now trying to do--we've just introduced that this year because we&#13;
revamped the YP Program a bit this year-is at least to put a bigger emphasis on looking at the&#13;
way we've always tried to assess YPs in terms of their potential ability to move from one sector&#13;
to another. We're also increasingly looking at some of the behavioral aspects ofYPs. I mean, do&#13;
they have the humility and the empathy to become a CDF [comprehensive development&#13;
framework] leader, to manage a CDF-type relationship, which is the way we obviously have to&#13;
go. For the first time this year we introduced behavioral assessments, systematic behavioral&#13;
assessment, as part of the selection process.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Are there any other changes, do you think, that might be necessary to the program, aside&#13;
from this move towards a more behavioral analysis?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, when I joined, most of them had macroeconomic type backgrounds. Then we&#13;
went through a phase when they all had MBA-type backgrounds. Then we reverted to&#13;
economics. In recent years we've been looking at how anthropologists would fit in-people&#13;
who've done something a little bit different.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Any historians?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: No. I don't think we'd ever dare to do that! A few sociologists, maybe!&#13;
&#13;
Q: You don't want to get that soft!&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Actually, I think one of the most underrated disciplines is economic history. Many&#13;
times over economic advice has actually been wrong; a study of economic history will teach you&#13;
this very quickly and hopefully result in some needed humility. I think political economy is also&#13;
very important. The French always called it political economy, but the neoclassical Anglo-Saxon&#13;
world di"dn't. They preferred the science of economics instead. I came out of school just when&#13;
the triumph of econometrics and mathematical economics over "political economy" reached its&#13;
zenith. It wasn't that they didn't produce excellent theoretical work, but it took us almost a&#13;
generation to figure out that there was something more; i.e., that sound and political development&#13;
we need is so important. And we suffered for that.&#13;
&#13;
Q: You might have touched on this, but we wanted to ask in general how would you answer&#13;
criticisms made over the years that many of the managers that came out of the YP program were&#13;
perhaps short on practical experience, especially in terms of their ability to manage people?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: They were certainly short of practical experience because all their practical experience&#13;
had been in the Bank; although the age of the YP Program has increased over the years. When I&#13;
joined I think the average age was about 25. It is now about 30. Most of them have got some&#13;
serious hands-on experience in the field before they join. Actually I had volunteer experience. I&#13;
think that was one of the things that stood me in good stead. However, it's interesting that I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Richard D. Stern&#13;
                               January 18 and 19, 2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
played down my volunteer experience early on in the Bank, not because I didn't think it was&#13;
incredibly relevant, but that was considered to be somehow a bit soft and woolly.&#13;
&#13;
Q: But in the matter of managing people?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: The technicians always said that they were undermined by their generalist managers,&#13;
particularly the ex-YPs. And I mean that was genuine expression on their part. Whether it had&#13;
any real validity, I think, is another matter. They felt that we often compromised on important&#13;
professional issues and that their managers-many ofwhom were ex-YPs~ould not withstand&#13;
the institutional pressure to lend. They then concluded that this was the reason why projects&#13;
failed. However, I think this is not a correct view. Many projects were failing but the reasons&#13;
why were more to do with lack of institutional depth, lack of a professional civil service,&#13;
corruption in many countries, and perhaps, most importantly, a lack of ownership. These things&#13;
are mainstream now but were not at that time. So I would be careful of drawing certain&#13;
conclusions. Did the absence of practical experience by some managers contribute to some&#13;
failures? Absolutely, but not in the way that it's typically understood.&#13;
&#13;
By the way, we always have been, at least in my view, a knowledge and learning institution. Let&#13;
me give you an example. It was either the third day, fourth or fifth day I was here at the Bank, I&#13;
walked into this fabulous meeting on rural employment creation in East Pakistan between John&#13;
Mellor, who was one of the world's leading agricultural economists, and a guy called Phil&#13;
[Phillip Z.] Kirpich, an engineer who had drilled tube wells all over the world before coming to&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
I just walked into this debate, and there was John Mellor saying, "You know, ifyou shadow&#13;
price tube well construction rather than comprehensive drilling, then labor intensive is the way to&#13;
go."&#13;
&#13;
And Phil Kirpitch was saying, "Look, I've never seen a labor intensive well that hasn't&#13;
collapsed. In a rig you can drill a well in 24 hours; you can drill 3 as deep as you need to go.&#13;
Furthermore, if you want to create employment, you can drill the well with a rig during the wet&#13;
season and create more employment in the first dry season (through irrigated crops) than you can&#13;
by drilling the wells in a labor intensive way." They were both raising legitimate points and we&#13;
were all learning.&#13;
&#13;
ljust sat there and said, "Wow! This is fabulous! These people know what they're talking about,&#13;
and moreover there's going to be some action by the Bank at the end of it." So it mattered, the&#13;
debate.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So then, jumping way ahead here, the emphasis on the Bank as a knowledge institution is by&#13;
no means misplaced?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It's by no means misplaced, but it's a great mistake to think that this is something new.&#13;
It's always been a knowledge bank. Sometime during early '69 [RobertS.] McNamara must have&#13;
announced some big expansion plans. Even then people then were complaining that it wasn't like&#13;
what it used to be! But at 2000 and even at 3000 staff, as it was in the early 1970's, osmosis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Richard D. Stern&#13;
                              January 18 and 19, 2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
worked in terms of knowledge transfer. If you came across a problem that you knew nothing&#13;
about, you just walked outside your office and shouted, "Does anybody know ... "&#13;
Most of the staff working on the same problem area sat together. You didn't really need formal&#13;
mechanisms. When you went on mission with a interdisciplinary team, you smoked, drank and&#13;
talked every night, and it was all about work and nothing else particularly. The knowledge&#13;
transfer and knowledge building that took place was quite incredible.&#13;
&#13;
When you went on a mission, you met every night. The duration of a mission was three or four&#13;
or five weeks; you actually wrote letters home. So you invariably built up a very close knit team.&#13;
The mentoring and the guidance that you got from your team was quite tremendous and&#13;
incredibly important for your career development.&#13;
&#13;
Q: We'd like to talk a little bit more about your career, more specifically your first assignments&#13;
which were in East Africa country programs between '70 and '78. Do you want to add some&#13;
more to what you've already said as to how these early assignments affected your thinking about&#13;
development in the institution?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yes. I mean, it was very important. One, it was in all three countries: Kenya,&#13;
Tanzania, and Uganda. We made some serious mistakes. We got totally enamored by [Julius]&#13;
Nyerere's revolution. I mean, he was an incredibly charismatic figure, and just his honesty,&#13;
commitment, and his willingness to do things different and openly philosophize about mistakes&#13;
that have been made in the past. He was incredibly compelling. But it was, you know, one of the&#13;
first genuine attempts to target the poor, to take income distribution issues seriously. But one of&#13;
the lessons I learned from that was you over-rule technicians at your peril; we did overrule&#13;
technicians in Tanzania in the early '70s.&#13;
&#13;
So when Tanzania forced "villagization," the agriculturists were saying, "Look, in Africa you&#13;
don't have villages--for very good agro-economic reasons--and these programs are destroying&#13;
that." The Tanzanian government also destroyed the cooperative movement because it was run&#13;
by the rich farmers, so they were, therefore, targets. We learnt that you cannot substitute&#13;
nationalized marketing and credit parastatals for coops because LDC [less developed country]&#13;
governments don't have the human and bureaucratic capacity to handle it. The technicians told us&#13;
that and they were dead right. We were beginning to understand the importance of coherent&#13;
country strategy over a project approach, but we went overboard. So we made some spectacular,&#13;
I mean really spectacular mistakes.&#13;
&#13;
You've also got to remember that at that time we all had great faith in the ability of governments&#13;
to correct for market failure. So, you'd have McNamara being perfectly comfortable with us&#13;
supporting nationalized maize, forestry, pulp and paper, textiles, and shoe factories in Tanzania.&#13;
We all believed that this was the way to go. Again, you've got to put it in that context. [Richard&#13;
M.] Nixon had price controls in the early ..&#13;
&#13;
Q: Right. In '73.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Working in Africa also teaches you that your chances of getting it wrong are&#13;
extremely high. It forces you to be a bit humble. It is good to learn that early in your career.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Many in the Bank have great difficulty conceiving the fact that they've got it wrong. Because&#13;
they're really fairly bright, because they're usually well trained because they go for analytical and&#13;
logical approaches; how can they be wrong? There are lots of Bank staff far brighter than me and&#13;
technically much better, but I was always willing to sit there and say, "Look, you know, maybe&#13;
you haven't got it right. I mean, not because I disagree with any of your logic. Your logic is&#13;
impeccable, but you may be missing something!" I think that if you don't get that fairly early in&#13;
your career, then you crash badly.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, what you're saying is that culture is important and that culture is not necessarily a&#13;
logical construct.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yes. It's got to do with understanding, maturity, and self deprecation.&#13;
&#13;
Q: We'd like to turn to--again, you've touched on some of these parts of your career already, but&#13;
if you could talk a little more about the circumstances surrounding your appointment and some&#13;
of your experiences as chief of the Indonesia Division in 1978?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, let me give you just some anecdotes to start off with. In those days there was no&#13;
system for promoting people. There was something called a division chiefs list which was kept&#13;
in the bowels of Personnel somewhere. But that list was a very long list. It was far longer than&#13;
the number of vacancies that would come up in any given year. The patronage of the director and&#13;
the vice president has always been important, but it was incredibly important in those days. It&#13;
was a very hierarchical sort of place. Stanley Please, my director, and Shahid Husain, the VP&#13;
[vice president] in East Africa, decided that they wanted to promote me. Ping Loh, who was the&#13;
division chief for East Africa, was on his way to Indonesia was also very supportive, and so they&#13;
decided they were going to give me the East African job. Then Shahid Husain went to East Asia&#13;
and brought Stanley Please over. So then they said, "Well, why don't we bring Richard over to&#13;
the Indonesia Division?" And so it was just fixed, and I was off to Indonesia. There clearly was&#13;
no real system.&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia was a fascinating learning experience. On the substantive side I was dealing with a&#13;
much more sophisticated set of counterparts than I had encountered in Africa. The "Berkeley&#13;
Mafia" were running Indonesia's economic policy. The "Berkeley Mafia" was fairly powerful&#13;
because Suharto depended for his legitimacy on strong macro economic growth. It was the&#13;
heyday of our work on the rural sector. We were lending something like $1 billion a year.&#13;
Indonesia and Brazil were the largest Bank programs at that time. Agricultural and rural projects&#13;
were about 80 percent of the totaL McNamara decided to go for a rural poverty oriented&#13;
approach. And we were doing it. We generated a whole series of agriculture projects for&#13;
fertilizers, seeds, extension, and irrigation projects, and by and large they worked. The rural&#13;
credit projects were by and large hijacked by the richer farmers. But the bottom line was during&#13;
the 1970s through the mid-1990s, the portion in absolute poverty went from 80 percent to 20&#13;
percent. It was a remarkable achievement. Did we see the massive corruption? Yes. Did we talk&#13;
about it with the government? Yes. Was it a key part of our agenda? No. We were heavily&#13;
involved in the movement of the micro economy giving significant advice--along with others--to&#13;
Indonesia's economic managers. I would argue that Indonesia's development was one of the&#13;
great achievements of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The other interesting thing about Indonesia was the way that we ran ourselves. We had&#13;
tremendous problems in running an integrated operation between the Bank and in Jakarta. Bernie&#13;
[Bernard R.] Bell started the tradition of empowered Directors in the field. McNamara put him&#13;
out there. Just to give you an idea of his rank, when Bernie came back from Indonesia, he came&#13;
back as vice president for East Africa. The division of responsibilities between HQ and the&#13;
Resident Mission was however very unclear. However, my own view is that in a multi-&#13;
disciplinary organization such as the Bank, such "clarity" is always going to be somewhat&#13;
obscure, so if you don't recognize that, then you're headed for eternal frustration.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Would you say that's one of the main things you took away from your experience in&#13;
Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, it was. The other was the importance of well designed programs and the impact&#13;
they can have on poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
Â·By the way, I forgot to mention our pioneering Kampong improvement programs. There were&#13;
 revolutionary urban development programs. They focused on upgrading simple infrastructure:&#13;
 paths and drains. Once these slums were protected from flooding, the neighborhoods would just&#13;
 improve themselves dramatically. It was a pioneering program. Actually--and although we didn't&#13;
 call it that in those days--we were building serious local ownership. And we did so in a very&#13;
 corrupt society. In the late 1990s such corruption became the major impediment to development&#13;
 in Indonesia, but we were able to accomplish a lot in spite of it at the time.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, how is it that at the end of your term in '83 you moved from Indonesia to&#13;
telecommunications?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It's aninteresting story. It had been five years and it was time for me to move. I had&#13;
worked on Africa and Asia. I felt I was beginning to get some geographical diversity. Career-&#13;
wise it was possible that I might be able to get a program director assignment, but I was told,&#13;
"Look, you really have to do one more assignment before you can become a program director."&#13;
Personnel was also beginning to promote cross functional (programs to projects and vice versa)&#13;
transfers for managers to prepare them for senior assignments.&#13;
&#13;
By that time the operational managers review group (OMRG), which was a group chaired by&#13;
Ernie Stern, who was the senior vice president for Operations, had been established. This is&#13;
where they reviewed the performance of all the operational managers and discussed what their&#13;
next jobs should be. OMRG decided that it would be a good idea for me to move to projects, and&#13;
as I mentioned earlier, over the opposition of some middle managers.&#13;
&#13;
Hans Fuchs accepted me as the manager of the telecommunications division. There were several&#13;
people who said to me, "Why do you want to take that job? You are taking yourself out of the&#13;
mainstream and you will slow your promotion. 11 I am sure my promotion to director was held up&#13;
for at least four or five years because of that, but it contributed greatly to my professional&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: What were your responsibilities in this division?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, it was a global division, which, by the way, was one of the attractions because&#13;
up until that time I had worked only in the regional complexes. It was considered to be the most&#13;
technical division of the Bank. It was staffed by telecom engineers and financial analysts and&#13;
only one telecom economist to give them an overview. The work ofthe division focused on&#13;
technical evaluations of clients' programs and institution building of state telecom companies&#13;
and procurement. Up to that time the division's biggest impact was probably in reducing the&#13;
costs of procurement by insisting on international bidding. By happenstance, my arrival&#13;
coincided with the early days of the telecom revolution. It coincided almost exactly with the&#13;
breakup of AT&amp;T. Competition in the provision of telecom services was just beginning to be&#13;
introduced, and privatization was introduced as a core objective. By the time I left the division,&#13;
we had recruited a bunch of economists and broader development types in there, and we were&#13;
beginning to understand the new regulatory agenda.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, then, how did you go from the Telecom Division to Chief of China, Finance and&#13;
Industry, in 1987?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, first, the Telecom Division was actually located in the Industry and Energy&#13;
Department and that's how the industry tag got sort of linked to me. It was time for me tq move&#13;
on because it had been four or five years since I last moved and, most important, the telecom&#13;
division was eliminated in the 1987 reorganization. In the drive for country focus, all central&#13;
sectoral departments were abolished.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Organizationally it was fashionable at the time to decentralize.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: That's right! I mean, decentralize, get closer to the client, and move to a demand rather&#13;
than a supply driven agenda. I thought I had a good chance of actually getting one ofthe new&#13;
country director positions. Ifl had actually remained as a country division chief, rather than have&#13;
moved to a sector division in '82/'83, I think I might have got one. So I actually got my job&#13;
through the informal personal network. There was no system. It was an anarchy! Well, it was&#13;
anarchy with war lords. It seriously eroded any faith of the staff in the organizational integrity of&#13;
the institution. I had always operated under the assumption that you could be a bit quirky, but&#13;
provided you were a good professional and seen to be good, the institution would always look&#13;
after you.&#13;
&#13;
Q: But you weren't alone in coming to that conclusion?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: No. But, I had never worried, whereas other people had worried a lot about their&#13;
careers, I had never bothered much. It wasn't that I wasn't ambitious, but you always felt that&#13;
somehow you'd be alright. In 1987, I lost that confidence.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What were your responsibilities, and what did you take away from that experience?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: In contrast to most other Bank clients, China had an active industry project portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                         Richard D. Stern&#13;
                               January 18 and 19, 2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                             11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        China was an economy in transition, and enterprise reform, particularly in the industry sector,&#13;
        was seen to be a critical part of the transition. We also had a whole bunch of projects in the&#13;
        fertilizer sector which were seen as providing crucial agricultural programs. We also became&#13;
        heavily invested in the first financial sector reform. It was still very much a command economy&#13;
        in 1987. The Chinese had spent the first eight or nine years of the reforms on the rural sector, so&#13;
        they were shifting to the industry sector. There was massive over employment in the industrial&#13;
        labor force in China at that time coupled with obsolete and loss-making enterprises. We became&#13;
        heavily involved in the first stages of industrial enterprise reform and restructuring.&#13;
&#13;
        Q: In 1991 you were selected to lead the Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme, or&#13;
        ESMAP, established in 1983. Why do you believe you were selected for this position, and what&#13;
        challenges did you face there?&#13;
&#13;
        STERN: Well, it was pure happenstance. I was promoted from the China division to become&#13;
        head of the Operations and Policy. However, I never settled down in that job, because after five&#13;
        weeks [Visvanathan] Rajagopalan, who was vice president, said, "Look, we have a serious&#13;
        problem with ESMAP. The donors which support the Programme are threatening to withdraw,&#13;
        and we need to draft someone in there quickly to clean up the mess and instill confidence, so I'm&#13;
        moving you in there."&#13;
&#13;
        The ESMAP was set up in the aftermath of the second oil shock, around 1980. As a consequence&#13;
        of the rapid increase in oil prices, many countries had to rewrite their energy strategies overnight,&#13;
        get themselves less dependent on oil and into hydro, coal, energy efficiency programs. Many of&#13;
        them had to make substantial policy adjustments including difficult price and tariff reforms.&#13;
        Many countries also faced serious institutional problems with loss-making and inefficient energy&#13;
        companies. Many countries thus needed assistance to help them rewrite their energy strategies.&#13;
        So ESMAP was put together by the Bank and several bilateral donors. It was jointly sponsored&#13;
        by UNDP [United Nations Development Program]. It was basically a technical assistance effort,&#13;
        appended to the Energy Department at the time.&#13;
&#13;
        There was a lot of talk in the early '80s about whether we should set up a separate energy&#13;
        facility/organization. For a variety of reasons, for which I'm not fully familiar with, that idea was&#13;
        killed in the early '80s, but the idea of a joint T A [technical assistance] effort for the energy&#13;
        sector, embodied in ESMAP, prevailed. It managed about 50 or 60 million dollars a year worth&#13;
Â· ofTA at that time. ESMAP continued to run through the '80s, even though the price of oil&#13;
tistarted to drop during the '80s. During that time ESMAP became less focused; e.g., it moved into&#13;
~ rural energy, and it started to work in oil and gas. Its management coherence also started to&#13;
, disappear and donor disillusionment started to appear.&#13;
    ~&#13;
&#13;
        By early 1990, there had been a complete breakdown in communication between the Bank&#13;
        managers of the programme and the bilateral donors. Bank management was keen to work on&#13;
        issues relating to privatization. Many of the donors were more interested in rural energy and&#13;
        environmental matters. There was still a fairly substantial number of people working for ESMAP&#13;
        in the early 1990s, about 40 or 50 people for which the Bank was only funding about 25 percent.&#13;
          ""'n'"'" it all culminated in a consultative     (CG) meeting in_Qe~~v.&lt;-t__i_~ late 1991,&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  . And do you think it succeeded in meeting its objectives?&#13;
&#13;
  TERN: I think it did, but we had to change it dramatically. The first thing that I did was to ask&#13;
    an audit. I also recruited a guy called Larry Smucker as financial controller. After about two&#13;
or three runs, it became apparent that we were absolutely bankrupt. What they were doing was&#13;
taking funds provided by donors for particular projects and using them for staff who were&#13;
working on others, so we weren't in conformity with trust fund agreements. First we had to&#13;
refund the project accounts from the World Bank's administrative budget, and then we had to&#13;
scramble to rebuild the reputation of ESMAP vis-a-vis the donors so that the funds would start to&#13;
flow again, and we could move on. So that's basically what I did for that first year and a half:&#13;
basically put together a coherent strategy for ESMAP and reestablish donor confidence. We had&#13;
to submit ourselves to all sorts of reporting and monitoring and a great deal of donor interaction.&#13;
In the end, we developed a clear and comprehensive strategy which included a fair bit of work on&#13;
rural energy and the environment.&#13;
&#13;
This is not an easy dialogue but in the end I think it beneficial for the Bank. Other donors often&#13;
recognize important issues before the Bank does. For example, we could not have written the&#13;
rural energy strategy paper in 1995 (I think) if it had not been for the work that had been funded&#13;
by bilateral donors ofESMAP. I doubt the Bank would have ever funded rural energy work&#13;
implemented by ESMAP from its own administrative budget.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So, in other words, it's a device to give the Bank some flexibility?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Look, I'm biased, but the trust funds have always been a dilemma for the Bank.&#13;
However, they have become a fairly significant portion of the Bank's budget. Many trust funds&#13;
have been very important in helping the Bank do the necessary ground which later results in a&#13;
new policy.&#13;
&#13;
We would have been in even bigger trouble on the environment; You know, the Bank carne late&#13;
to the environment agenda, and much of the environment agenda is energy. And, again, if we&#13;
hadn't done many of those environment projects with ESMAP, primarily at the instigation of the&#13;
Dutch--because they were pushing a very strong agenda--we may not have been able to&#13;
accomplish the late adjustment we eventually made.&#13;
&#13;
In other areas it was more difficult. I had--other than the Norwegians--terrible trouble getting&#13;
the donors to agree to adopt what I thought was an innovative gas agenda because they said,&#13;
"Look, this is big stuff! This is what the private sector does." But, I always used to argue, "Look,&#13;
gas is the energy and the feed stock of choice during the transition towards non fossil fuels. It has&#13;
30, 40 percent less C02 than coal; it is great for a positive environmental impact, but you have to&#13;
move it.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So you stepped down as its chair just last April?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yes. What happened was, wheni was given the Energy Department in the '93 Â·&#13;
reorganization, we reintegrated ESMAP and the Energy Department. They also added the&#13;
Telecom and Mining groups at the same time. When I became VP of HR and Jean Francois&#13;
[Rischard] was Vice President of Private Sector Development, he chaired ESMAP. Then, when&#13;
he went to Paris, I assumed it for a year and a half or so to keep the continuity.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Right. Including through pipelines.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Absolutely, and you can only move gas across national borders if you have the proper&#13;
policy and regulatory regimes in place. And who better placed than the Bank to do the policy and&#13;
regulatory work? We could move some of the environment and rural work to the bilaterally&#13;
funded projects. So I would argue that providing our own agenda is consistent, it contributes to&#13;
our own sort ofthinking on development. These things can be very helpful.&#13;
&#13;
I started off by thinking that the CG was the bind because we had to go and convince a lot of&#13;
donors that we're actually good chaps who could be trusted to spend their money. And we&#13;
wanted the money and we just went after it. I'm now convinced that having those bilateral&#13;
strongly held views on environment and rural energy and energy for the poor and forcing us--&#13;
because they had the money--to think about those things was extremely important. I think we all&#13;
were too arrogant to figure that out ourselves. So, again, I used to say that publicly to them, and&#13;
it wasn't just to make them feel good, although it helped without using the CG as a substantive&#13;
mechanism for feedback to talk about priorities.&#13;
&#13;
And, by the way, it went the other way, too. I mean, I had no problem in telling them, "You're&#13;
being run by your own vested interests." And it got to the point where we were all friendly&#13;
enough to do that. And sometimes you make some progress, and sometimes you don't. But it&#13;
worked.&#13;

Q: We are here again today, January 19th, 2001, at the World Bank Headquarters in&#13;
Washington, DC, to continue our oral history interview with Richard Stem, who has just retired&#13;
recently as Vice President, Human Resources. We left off yesterday as you were talking about&#13;
the role or function of the Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP) within&#13;
the Energy Department. And you wanted to continue on and discuss the iJ!tegration of ESMAP&#13;
with IFC [International Finance Corporation], as I recalL&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yes, that's right. Maybe I should just give it a little bit of background as to when&#13;
ESMAP and the Energy Department reintegrated in 1993. It coincided with a major change in&#13;
the Bank's infrastructure agenda. Competition, deregulation, and privatization became in the late&#13;
'80s and early '90s the core infrastructure strategy ofthe Bank. Telecom, power, oil and gas, and&#13;
water all moved at slightly different rates in making that transition, but the philosophy and&#13;
approach were clear. The Bank thus moved from an approach characterized by supporting public&#13;
sector investments still associated with institutional strengthening to a private competitive&#13;
paradigm. This change meant that the Bank and IFC had to come closer together.&#13;
&#13;
The IFC was also being affected by the increasing private sector involvement in infrastructure.&#13;
They set up their own infrastructure department sometime in the late '80s and throughout the&#13;
early 90's. IFC saw a very rapid growth in its infrastructure investment during the early 1990's.&#13;
In fact it actually became their largest sector in terms of the value of the operations.&#13;
&#13;
With that in mind, Sam [Everett J.] Santos, who was head of the Infrastructure Department in&#13;
IFC, and I, being his main counterpart over on the Bank side (not completely, because transport&#13;
and water were in a separate department), started discussions on how we might bring our&#13;
activities more closely together: one, because it was just more efficient to do that, and two,&#13;
because the Bank and IFC were confusing our client. For example, separate missions from the&#13;
Bank, the IFC, and sometimes MIGA [Multinational investment Guarantee Agency] would visit&#13;
a client often giving different messages. This was despite the natural synergies, namely, the Bank&#13;
concentrating on its core business public policy and the IFC concentrating on its project&#13;
financing.&#13;
&#13;
Sam Santos and I, as an experiment, proposed that we integrate the work of the two Telecom&#13;
divisions and create one unit which would work for both institutions while booking the&#13;
transactions pertaining to each institution separately. We planned to work out some sort of&#13;
budget arrangement where each institution would pay for services relating to its own&#13;
transactions. The idea was to start with telecommunications and then move to power. We felt the&#13;
logic for our proposal compelling. If we, for example, had a history all over again, the IFC and&#13;
the Bank and MIGA would never have been set up as separate institutions. They reflected the&#13;
prevailing development paradigms of 1944, 1956 (when the IFC was set up), and the '80s (when&#13;
MIGA was established). When EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]&#13;
was set up in the early '90s, they were given the capability to offer lending instruments, from&#13;
sovereign lending right through to equity participation. The fact that our three institutions are&#13;
separate is really an accident of history. Sam and I believed that we were being pragmatic in our&#13;
&#13;
                                        Richard D. Stern&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
approach and responsive to the needs of our clients. So why not do it in a pragmatic way? Since&#13;
Jim [James D.] Wolfensohn is president ofboth institutions we thought "virtual" integration&#13;
would be very easy.&#13;
&#13;
We ran into a brick wall. While they were sympathetic, senior Bank management was totally&#13;
preoccupied by the on-going reorganizations that were taking place at that time. The pace of&#13;
decentralization was picking up and management were giving a lot of attention to resolving the&#13;
prevailing confusion between the networks and the regions. I think Gautam Kaji and Caio Koch-&#13;
Weser had too much on their plate. That's my view, of course, but I think it is correct.&#13;
&#13;
On the IFC side, we hit a brick wall at the vice presidential level. We were actually quite&#13;
surprised, because we had received some sympathetic encouragement from Jannik Lindbaek,&#13;
who was the EVP [executive vice president] ofiFC. The IFC vice presidents, however, argued&#13;
that commingling the transaction culture of the IFC with the Bank's policy approach would&#13;
somehow slow down business. In retrospect, this view was narrow and laughable. Many of the&#13;
infrastructure transactions that were made during that time, particularly in the power sector,&#13;
ultimately got into trouble. They failed largely because the enabling environment, both at the&#13;
macro and the sector level in many cases; e.g., Indonesia, had not been fully thought through.&#13;
IFC rapidly expanded their private infrastructure portfolio and often ignored potential problems&#13;
in the regulatory and competitive environment.&#13;
&#13;
IFC also worried at the prospect of the big elephant rolling over on the mouse. The IFC had,&#13;
particularly under William Ryrie, who preceded Lindbaek, made a big deal about being&#13;
independent from the Bank. They were building their new building at the time, and the slogan of&#13;
IFC "under its own roof," was a popular refrain, a sort of a metaphor of the separation mentality.&#13;
It was quite bizarre because it was totally out of sync with evolving development theory and&#13;
practice.&#13;
&#13;
So the "integration" idea was rejected. After long, long discussions, they finally agreed on a&#13;
weak compromise that we would co-locate the two units so they would sit together, and osmosis&#13;
would be nurtured. Jean Francois Richard, who was vice president ofFPSI [Finance, Private&#13;
Sector and Infrastructure Network] at the time, and I were obviously very disappointed, but we&#13;
said, "Look, if this is all we can do, let's do it." And so, since we had some space in our building,&#13;
the IFC Telecommunications Division came over to a building in my department. But just to&#13;
show you how minor the IFC commitment was, the moment that the new IFC building was&#13;
finished the IFC group just up and left overnight without any discussion whatsoever. That was&#13;
the first saga of our attempt to integrate.&#13;
&#13;
Oui second attempt was just as frustrating. About a year later, after Jim Wolfensohn became&#13;
president in June '95, when he was in Wyoming for that summer he got a visit from some of his&#13;
friends in the power sector. I think it was Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, but I'm not sure about that. And&#13;
they had talked to him about how the Bank group might better help them in their investments and&#13;
the private sector more generally overseas. So Jim basically asked us to prepare a briefing. If I&#13;
recall correctly, he sent the note to V.J. Chaudhury, who was Power Division Chief in IFC at the&#13;
time, and myself as director of the Energy Department asking us to give him our thoughts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Richard D. Stern&#13;
                              January 18 and 19, 2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So, again, I got together with Sam Santos and V .J. and we sent Jim a joint note. The note told&#13;
him what we were currently doing in the power sector, in both the Bank and IFC, and saying&#13;
how, at least in our view, we needed to work more closely together if we were to be a more&#13;
effective catalyst for private sector investment. We met Jim when he came back from his&#13;
vacation, and by that time Richard Frank, the MD [Managing Director] for private sector&#13;
development, also became very involved and interested, and since he came from IFC to the&#13;
Bank, we figured we'd have a champion there.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, the upshot was that we put together a task force which I and V.J. led jointly. We&#13;
explored the idea of integrating the work of the power groups in the Bank and IFC. I remember&#13;
telling Jim before it all started that I was delighted to be doing that because I thought it was so&#13;
important, but I didn't want to get into the same trap that we'd gotten into with Telecom. Jim,&#13;
who was new to the Bank and said, "Don't worry," he was committed, and we were absolutely&#13;
going to do this. So, we put together a task force consisting of various interest groups in IFC,&#13;
including its legal department and representative of the Bank's regional energy divisions. One of&#13;
the advantages in Telecom was that there were only two central units, one in each institution. On&#13;
the energy side, we had not only a central department, headed by me, but six regional divisions,&#13;
so it was bureaucratically much more complicated.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, the bottom line was, after a couple of months of meetings, at the middle management&#13;
level we succeeded in putting together a consensus to bring the two functions together. We had&#13;
some pretty specific organizational recommendations, and we thought we had also resolved&#13;
some of the legal issues associated with "breaking the corporate veil". Anyway, to cut a long&#13;
story short, we ended up in exactly the same stalemate as we had previously, except this time not&#13;
only did we face the opposition ofiFC's senior management but also that of the regional vice&#13;
presidents, who were less than enthusiastic about giving up some of their power and&#13;
responsibility. And that's about where it ended--with deep frustration which continued until Peter&#13;
Woike was appointed EVP ofiFC. By that time, I had become VP for HR.&#13;
&#13;
Q: That was in '98.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It was early 1998 or late 1997. I negotiated his contract. When Jean Francois went to&#13;
Paris, we had a vacancy for the FPSI VP. I argued strongly--since this time I was closer to the&#13;
throne-that we should use the opportunity to have another go at bringing IFC and the Bank&#13;
closer together. And Jim was very receptive. And, you know, Jim always claims that he had&#13;
every idea, but I think it was actually mine. I was the one who recommended we appoint Peter&#13;
Woicke, who was EVP of IFC, also MD for the Bank's Private Sector activities. And that was&#13;
finally agreed.&#13;
&#13;
Now, once that was done, then it became much easier to make progress. We now have several&#13;
joint Bank/IFC units, all having teething problems but finding progress has been made. My own&#13;
view is that too many of the current managers of the joint units were reflecting their past IFC&#13;
background giving too much weight to transactions over policy and institutional matters. I think&#13;
it displays a total lack of understanding of the development mission of the Bank Group. But&#13;
that's the way it is. So substance integration is going slowly, but at least the formal process has&#13;
been finally initiated. It's a good example ofthe challenge of institutional change and how&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                      17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
difficult it is to do it, but it's also something that you've just got to keep on fighting for, because&#13;
otherwise it will never happen.&#13;
&#13;
The other point I should like to highlight about my time in the Energy Department was the&#13;
increasing attention on the environment. We became under increasing pressure with respect to&#13;
energy to have a more active environment involvement. The NGOs [non-governmental&#13;
organizations] were deeply suspicious of our intentions and whether or not we were serious with&#13;
respect to the environment. Most of the pressure came from the NGO environment lobbies in the&#13;
U.S. and Northern Europe. These groups were less interested in development issues and an&#13;
increasing degree of frustration by the Southern NGOs was apparent. It was a very Northern&#13;
agenda. Now, in one sense, it's good, because it's reflecting the experiences of the developed&#13;
world. But there is also a degree of new imperialism "in terms of imposing first-world values on&#13;
the third world." The NGOs in the developed world are politically sophisticated. Professionally&#13;
sometimes they are not. However, the Bank has often been politically na!ve in dealing with them.&#13;
&#13;
We took on a number of environmental initiatives. For example, we established a working group&#13;
ofNGOs--between the Bank and NGOs--which I chaired, in North America and Europe, on the&#13;
environment. And we set that up sometime in the mid- '90s. We initiated a number of&#13;
environmental projects in Central Europe, Russia, China and India. The enormity of&#13;
environmental problems in these countries also demanded increased attention on our part. We&#13;
also initiated a strategy paper on energy and environment (for the first time in the Bank's&#13;
history), which was finalized after I left the department. I pushed very hard for win-win&#13;
solutions, particularly in promoting gas as a fuel of transition towards a non-carbon era. Does gas&#13;
contribute to global warming? Well, of course it does, it's a fossil fuel. But it only has 60 percent&#13;
of the C02 emissions of coal. It's a much cleaner fuel. You can feed it through the combined&#13;
cycle for power generation, which again is getting more and more efficient every day. And you&#13;
can use it for combined heat and power.&#13;
&#13;
Another "win-win" was raising the efficiency of coal boilers. For example, if you can raise the&#13;
average efficiency of small boilers in China to that which prevails in the West, which is not&#13;
particularly challenging, you save 100,000,000 tons of coal a year just in China, just by doing&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
So I was pushing very hard for such solutions. The environmental lobby--and our own&#13;
Environment Department, to some extent--felt that we needed to go further than that. My own&#13;
view was that their view was premature and overly dogmatic. The C02 agenda was, and is, in my&#13;
view, primarily an issue for the developed world at this time.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In your capacity as Director of Industry and Energy, what would you say were your&#13;
accomplishments in designing the Bank's energy policies and helping develop the Bank's&#13;
policies on energy and the environment?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I think I've covered a fair bit of that already. The new approaches were articulated in&#13;
two policy papers on energy and on power competition which I mentioned earlier. These were&#13;
produced just before I became Energy Director. Tony Churchill led that work. So the main&#13;
challenge during my time was to implement them. One of the biggest challenges we faced was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Richard D. Stern&#13;
                               January 18 and 19, 2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
convincing investors that sound regulatory environments were critical to the success of the new&#13;
competitive and private approach we were now supporting. In this connection we instituted&#13;
meetings with independent power producers where we discussed many of these issues. However,&#13;
in their rush to invest in new markets, many of these investors did not listen to us.&#13;
&#13;
In an interesting postscript, Jim made a speech to the Energy Congress in Houston. I guess that&#13;
would have been in 1998, probably, by which time of course we were in the throes ofthe East&#13;
Asia crisis and the investment euphoria had collapsed. In a very nice but very forceful way, he&#13;
said, "Look, we told you that the regulatory and policy environment were important. You didn't&#13;
respond to that. In fact, you were not very supportive of us. We bear no grudge, and we will&#13;
continue to work on these issues. But we'd appreciate it if you would actually help rather than&#13;
derail us."&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the work on competition and regulatory policy, my period as energy director saw&#13;
an increasing preoccupation with the environment and energy efficiency issue, especially in the&#13;
transition economies. One of my disappointments was that our efforts to get the Bank more&#13;
heavily involved in gas was not as successful as I had hoped. The critical issue is transporting it.&#13;
As I mentioned yesterday, gas clearly is a fuel of transition. And it seemed to me the Bank has a&#13;
very important role to play, particularly in mitigating the risks of cross pipelines. There was no&#13;
question that the Bank should be a major financier; the private sector will do that. But they can't&#13;
do it without a proper regulatory environment policy and, in some cases, without Bank&#13;
guarantees. It was always one of my frustrations that we couldn't move quicker. I think our lack&#13;
of success had something to do with a naive view, in my opinion, of certain country directors on&#13;
poverty alleviation: basically, that we don't have to touch this because the private sector will&#13;
take care of it. The difficulty in the Bank, which it is still struggling with, is that while a country&#13;
approach to determine assistance strategy is absolutely vital, the Bank's global agenda cannot&#13;
just be the aggregate of country programs&#13;
&#13;
Let me just mention the Arun Hydro Project very quickly. The proposed project was a major&#13;
controversy during my time as energy director and a major milestone in the Bank's history of&#13;
financing large dams. Actually Arun is, by hydro standards, a very small project. For Nepal,&#13;
however, it is a relatively very large project. For example, it would have consumed a third of the&#13;
country's overall budget during construction. The project had lots of technical risks and lots of&#13;
environmental risks. By the way, on the environment side, I thought we managed the risks&#13;
extremely well. While the project did become a high profile target of the global environment&#13;
lobby, I think it was unfairly targeted on those grounds.&#13;
&#13;
However, I and my colleagues in the Energy Department firmly believed that this project was&#13;
premature for Nepal. It was far too big; it required a level of management for which the local&#13;
power company were totally incapable. NEPA, the power company, was one of our worst&#13;
performing power entities. So we argued very strongly against it. This was a huge fight between&#13;
us and the regional management. This was the only investment project that ever went to the&#13;
Bank-wide Operations Committee, chaired at that time by Ernie Stem. What happened was Joe&#13;
(D. Joseph] Wood, the RVP [Regional Vice President], approved the project at the regional Loan&#13;
Committee level and we then appealed to Ernie Stem. Jean Francois and I pushed this very hard.&#13;
Joe was a gentleman, so he wasn't mad at us, but Ernie was clearly irritated with Rischard, my&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
            VP. And we basically said, "Look, you are paying us to be the professional conscience ofthe&#13;
        ~        and I don't care what you say, we damn well are going to do it!"&#13;
        ~&#13;
        ~&#13;
        Q&#13;
        ~                                                                 But, again, it does raise an&#13;
            mterestmg questiOn that real decisions are not made by the formal process. Rather, at some point&#13;
            during the dialogue in the early days of project development between the Bank and the borrower,&#13;
r           a commitment-moral/personal/institutional--is made. When that happened on this project I&#13;
';\.&#13;
 f."-&#13;
            don't know, but it was clear that we, in retrospect, were engaging in a charade in these meetings.&#13;
ru&#13;
~t          Just to finish the story on Arun. Jim Wolfensohn asked to be briefed on all the vulnerabilities he&#13;
            faced. Four or five risky projects we identified and Arun was one of them. We had another&#13;
            review--actually it was six or nine weeks after he joined. He asked Maurice Strong, who was his&#13;
            advisor, to handle it--Maurice was the ex-CEO of Ontario Hydro and a respected global authority&#13;
            on environment issues. And all Maurice did was--much to our delight--dig up all our old memos.&#13;
            He cut and pasted them--actually he made them less coherent--but that was alright. And we&#13;
            ended up with a committee chaired by Jim, where he pulled the plug on the project.&#13;
&#13;
            Some outside academic should actually write that up one of these days. It tells you a lot about the&#13;
            way the Bank actually worked and still works, tells you a lot about some of the outside forces&#13;
            that played at the time. The unfortunate result is that it's become so costly to do these projects in&#13;
            the future. We probably won't support as many as we should. I'm sure we got it right in saying&#13;
            we shouldn't do the Arun project, but there are a lot of larger projects, in the power sector and&#13;
            other sectors, that we should be doing and we probably won't do now.&#13;
&#13;
            Q: The scrutiny is too intense on these projects.&#13;
&#13;
            STERN: Well, the scrutiny is intense, but the scrutiny implies objectivity and fairness and that's&#13;
            not what often happens. While I firmly believe Jim made the right decision in Arun, we also&#13;
            have to recognize that outside pressures on the Bank and the new age of "transparency" has&#13;
            made it very difficult for the Bank to finance large controversial projects even when they pass&#13;
            rigorous economic, environmental, and social barriers.&#13;
&#13;
            Q: How did the challenges in your years in operations influence your thinking about personnel&#13;
            and human resource issues?&#13;
&#13;
            STERN: My operational experience was fundamental to determining my views on HR. I got the&#13;
            job in HR because ttie Bank management was in dire straits under the Strategic Compact. We&#13;
            had promised the Board that we would completely revamp the Bank's compensation and&#13;
            personnel policies; however, after nearly a year into the Strategic Compact, the HR function,&#13;
            basically, other than talking about it, had managed to do nothing. So to say that there was panic&#13;
            in the President's office was an understatement. I got a cold call from Sven Sandstrom. Jim&#13;
            Wolfenshon asked me to take the job. I think they tipped me because I had a reputation as being&#13;
            fairly pragmatic, and a guy who gets on with people. I was deeply frustrated. I didn't want the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                          January 18 and 19, 1001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
job. But anyway, it was clear, after two or three phone calls from Jim, that I really didn't have&#13;
any choice.&#13;
&#13;
My previous experience deeply colored the way I approached the job. I had a deep skepticism of&#13;
HR professionals. I firmly believed and still do that HR can support, but that the line operational&#13;
managers must take the lead on HR issues. The problem often is that many are reluctant to do so.&#13;
&#13;
One case where this had successfully happened was in the energy group, and the water and&#13;
transport group, which were probably the pioneers on HR issues. And I think a lot of that had to&#13;
do with--without touting my own trumpet--the personality of John Flora in the Transport Board&#13;
and myself in the Energy Board. Many ofthe sector boards felt they should do very little with&#13;
human resources and personnel. I argued very strongly that you could not embark on new&#13;
operational strategies and approaches unless you fixed the fundamental capacity of the Bank,&#13;
which is its human resources. Systemic and coherent training and recruitment was critical. If you&#13;
didn't make sure that recruitment was consistent with new strategic objectives, you would fail.&#13;
Given that attrition rates historically were quite low (two, three, four percent a year), every&#13;
recruitment decision was precious in terms of implementing any new approach.&#13;
&#13;
So I argued very strongly that the Board should take a very strong or proactive role in HR. And&#13;
we started to pioneer that. We did one of the first detailed surveys that were ever done in the&#13;
Bank of our actual HR resources in the energy sector. We had about 200 to 250 energy staff. We&#13;
catalogued the skills of each of them, so for the first time we were able to say, "Look, there are&#13;
skill gaps to implement our strategy." So I had actually given a lot of thought to several HR&#13;
issues before I came to HR.&#13;
&#13;
To complete the sector board story now, when I joined HR, I argued very strongly that the sector&#13;
board's role in recruitment should be formalized and institutionalized. This was a big fight&#13;
between me and the RVPs when I became vice president. We had many meetings with sector&#13;
boards where I told them this was their role. I deliberately brought along Caio, Sven and Gautam&#13;
[Kaji] (the Managing Directors at that time) to some of those meetings, because I wanted to ake&#13;
sure that there was institutional backing. The tension between the sector boards and the regional&#13;
role in recruitment decisions still continues, but for the first time in the history of the Bank, these&#13;
groups were now engaged in systematic quality management of the recruitment policy.&#13;
&#13;
Q: As VP for HR, to continue on with what you were talking about in the context of decision-&#13;
making, could you describe the relationship among HR, Management, and the Board? And our&#13;
next question is if you would care to discuss volunteering as chair of the Appeals Committee and&#13;
how that came about?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, I didn't volunteer. I also did it for about a year or so before I joined HR. I had to&#13;
resign as chair of the Appeals Committee when I joined HR.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How would you characterize this experience in terms of preparing you to tackle the&#13;
challenges in HR?&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I got a call from Shahid Husain, then the HR VP, asking would I do it. I said, "Fine." I&#13;
mean, I'd be happy to do it. It did help, because when you're on the Appeals Committee, you see&#13;
the consequence of lots of mistakes by management. You also get a very good feel of the attitude&#13;
of staff. I mean, it was an eye-opener for me. I must have been protected in my prior Bank life,&#13;
because I don't think that I faced many serious personnel issues. The Appeals Committee sees&#13;
the real problem cases, so you see the consequence of lots of pretty awful decisions and actions.&#13;
On the Management side, the mistakes are invariably the inability to confront the obvious early&#13;
performance issues. The bulk of appeals are usually about termination decisions or redundancy&#13;
decisions. Often these involved individuals who have problematic performance cases, usually&#13;
from the time they were hired; however, several generations of their managers have not dealt&#13;
with them. For example, renewing fixed term contracts rather than making a termination&#13;
decisions. Now, that raises all sorts of ethical and professional managerial issues. It also raises a&#13;
bunch of legal issues because, at some point, you are a long-term employee irrespective of your&#13;
contractual relationship with the Bank You also see some outrageous cases of staff trying to&#13;
exploit the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
But an interesting aspect of the Appeals Committee was that you had people appointed by the&#13;
Management, the Staff Association and both jointly. And it was very rare to see a case where&#13;
there was any disagreement between the three on the panel. Unanimity invariably prevailed.&#13;
&#13;
Q: With the arrival of James Wolfensohn in 1995, staff had still not fully recovered from the&#13;
1987 reorganization and its aftermath in terms of the fine tuning that continued to go on. Added&#13;
to that were the dramatic changes introduced with Wolfensohn's arrival resulting in the Board&#13;
approving the Strategic Compact exercise in March '97. Now, in light of what amounted to very&#13;
turbulent times for the Bank, what prompted you to accept the appointment initially as Deputy&#13;
VP Human Resources in 1997 and then as Vice President in early 1998?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, I basically had, as I mentioned before, in the end decided that really I had no&#13;
choice. I was called in by Sven, and I got a call from Jim about a couple of hours later. They&#13;
were clearly in trouble in their efforts to implement the HR aspects of the Strategic Compact.&#13;
They were having a terrible time going from slogans to actually figuring out what precisely to&#13;
do. I was under tremendous pressure from the top to accept. So I agreed to be a good institutional&#13;
soldier. I did extract a promise that in three years I'd be out of there. Well, I guess it was three&#13;
and a half years, and I was out ofthere!&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, what did you hope to accomplish, especially at a time when staff morale must have&#13;
been low and the perception of Personnel or HR was one of mistrust?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: It was very low. Well, I guess it was two or three things. One, just to develop as fast as&#13;
possible a coherent set of employment and compensation policies in place, that was clearly the&#13;
first marching order. Two, as I mentioned earlier, I did feel very strongly about recruitment, and&#13;
the need to develop a more institutionally focused system. All sector boards now do approve the&#13;
short list for every single external recruitment. Some take it very seriously. Others just rubber-&#13;
stamp what the recruiting manager wants to do. However, the practice is changing. Three, as I&#13;
also mentioned earlier, I felt very strongly that HR should be a facilitator and a source of advice&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
rather than a decision maker. I wanted to get the line to be the real HR managers. Only in that&#13;
way would morale ultimately improve.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now this would be in contrast to the way the Bank had traditionally viewed this?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Probably, although as always there is a lot of schizophrenia. I mean, different people&#13;
have held different views, and the same people have had different views over time. For example,&#13;
I told every sector board chair, "You are the HR manager for the Bank in your sector." And a lot&#13;
of them were surprised to hear that. And some members of HR felt that I was undermining their&#13;
function by taking such a position. Over time, I think I won over most of the people in HR, but&#13;
there were always some percentage that felt I was an outsider who was not an HR professional,&#13;
who did not understand its true nature. Now, I had enough self-confidence to go my own way on&#13;
that. If you look at my attitude surveys in HR, they are about 70 percent who are very supportive&#13;
and 30 percent who just couldn't stand me because I challenged what they thought their&#13;
fundamental views on the role of HR were.&#13;
&#13;
HR is a funny function. Again I'm making generalizations, and it's by no means universally, but&#13;
many HR professionals tend to be very unsure and uncertain of their role. I went to quite a few&#13;
HR conferences outside the Bank. It is not a very self-confident function in many organizations.&#13;
Often they retreat into control functions to justifY their own existence. And I would argue with&#13;
them, "Look, you have so much to do on the policy and strategy side-recruitment strategy,&#13;
compensation, policy, developing leadership and management talent, succession programs,&#13;
training--why do you need to spend much time on the controls and rules to tell line managers&#13;
what to do? Shouldn't you instead try to help them participate in taking on an institutional&#13;
perspective on these HR functions?"&#13;
&#13;
Q: In talking perhaps about other people that might have not been delighted with what you were&#13;
doing, and, in view of the fact that the Staff Association represents staff concerns, could you talk&#13;
a little bit about the nature of the interaction with HR?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: By the way, I would not accept the assertion that the Staff Association looks after staff&#13;
concerns. Often I believe that they do not well represent staff interests, but that's another matter.&#13;
I thought for the first year or two that we got on quite well with the Staff Association,&#13;
particularly since we were going through a very difficult time on the reform side where, for&#13;
example, it was clear. that some salary relativity among various staff categories was required. We&#13;
had a situation where, for a variety of historical reasons, support staff have been overpaid&#13;
.relative to the professional staff. You only have to look at what our secretarial staff get compared&#13;
to the rest of the Washington area, particularly with respect to benefits. And we all knew that we&#13;
 were going to have to take that on with the Staff Association.&#13;
&#13;
Typically Staff Association's membership and interests are biased towards the support and junior&#13;
staff. And the executive committee of the Staff Association is also more junior than the average&#13;
for the Bank. We were fortunate that we were in the initial period of the reforms dealing with a&#13;
constructive SA leadership. Jamil Sopher, the Chair of the Staff Association at that time,&#13;
recognized the issues we had to face and tired to deal with them in a reasonable and non-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Richard D. Stern&#13;
                               January 18 and 19,2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
confrontational way. But he, of course, in the process alienated himself from some of the other&#13;
leaders of the Staff Association.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing that you have to recognize in terms of the Staff Association is that the issue of&#13;
the NRS [non-regular staff] and the so-called long-term consultants colored everything. I think&#13;
I'm right in saying that the Executive Committee now has a majority of ex-NRS compared to the&#13;
30 percent that were in the Bank. In the early '90s (July'93), the Bank went to dollar budgeting.&#13;
When I first became a division chief, you had a higher level quota of staff, you had a support&#13;
quota of staff, and the only fungible money you had was your traveling and consulting budget.&#13;
When the Bank moved to dollar budgeting it did not change the personnel policies at the same&#13;
time. In hindsight, it was a fundamental error of the gravest proportions.&#13;
&#13;
So, over time, middle management, being fairly entrepreneurial (which is good) realized that&#13;
they could purchase long-term consultants much cheaper than regular staff. By the eve of the&#13;
reforms, we had 3,000 long-term consultants onboard, compared to a total population of about&#13;
12, 000 (Bank and IFC). Some ofthese long-term consultants were excellent; others were not.&#13;
In contrast to regular staff, there was no institutional system for recruiting them. Local managers&#13;
made the decisions. There was no monitoring of qualifications, no monitoring of consistency.&#13;
After a year or so as L TCs, the good ones would just say, "Look, if you want me to stay, you&#13;
have to give me a regular job, or else I'm going elsewhere; e.g, if you don't want me in&#13;
East Asia, there's a manager in Africa who will take me!" So, as a matter of fact, the excellent&#13;
LTCs didn't stay there very long. Again, in the time-honored tradition of Bank managers not&#13;
able to take hard decisions, they would just keep on extending the contracts of these LTCs who&#13;
could not get regular appointments.&#13;
&#13;
By the way, when I took over ESMAP (several years earlier), I let them go or we converted&#13;
them. As a group, they rightly felt vulnerable. They always had to fight for everything they got;&#13;
people who on average were not as good professionally as the rest of the regular Bank people&#13;
who somehow felt that they had a right to get everything. I'm not blaming anybody. The policy&#13;
was fundamentally flawed in the first place.&#13;
&#13;
By the way, it would be illegal under US and European labor law to have such a staff category;&#13;
you're either a long-term employee or you're not. And, if you are a long-term employee, which&#13;
they were, you're given the full range of benefits. It's just plain illegal not to! And so, if they&#13;
could have taken us to court (they couldn't because national courts do not have jurisdiction over&#13;
the Bank) they would have won, and we would have had to convert the lot!&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, how has the non-regular staff (NRS) exercise affected the Bank's reliance on&#13;
consultants in general?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, to rephrase that a bit, what we had to do was work out a way to eliminate the&#13;
category while protecting the long term interests of the institution, so what we did was basically&#13;
the following. We said, "Okay, we would convert NRS to regular staff but only if you are filtered&#13;
through an institutional screen .. We're not going to convert you automatically, but if you make it&#13;
through that screen then we will, subject to overall budget limitations, absorb you."&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Part of the "deal" on abolishing the NRS was, in the eyes of management and Jarnil Sopher, an&#13;
agreemennhat there be no past pension credits for NRS staff. Now, the current staff association&#13;
leadership feels that it wasn't part of the deal, and that in turn explains some of the current&#13;
problems and issues. When you combine that to the point you're making about the Wolfensohn&#13;
reforms coming in after a series offine-tunings and redundancies during the [Lewis T.] Preston&#13;
era after the 1987 reorganization and the fact that one-third of the staff feel that they have had to&#13;
fight for every concession, a degree of disillusionment is inevitable. When we finally went to the&#13;
Board with the compensation reforms, we were quite proud of ourselves because we got&#13;
unanimous approval in the Board, which had never been done before on a compensation issue.&#13;
And we had the Staff Association stand up there and say, "We don't like every little bit of it, but&#13;
as a package, we're prepared to support it." The SA accepted that political support for the then&#13;
Kafka compensation approach.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In talking about the Board, specifically in the context of Board, Management and HR&#13;
relations, had the Board pushed you in any way on this? In other words, did you feel pressured&#13;
by the Board?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: On compensation issues?&#13;
&#13;
Q: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: You know the Board was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the so-called&#13;
Kafka compensation system for a variety of reasons: one, it linked us automatically to the Fund,&#13;
and they felt there were some differences; two, some EDs felt that many categories of staff were&#13;
over paid; others felt that it was just a few. Many public institutions had over the previous ten&#13;
years or so, the Americans and the Canadians in particular, gone through quite a bit of budget&#13;
retrenchment. For example, the Canadians were balking at fairly automatic salary increases to&#13;
Bank staff while their civil servants had gotten none for about seven or eight years. Conversely,&#13;
some EDs felt we were having problems attracting certain candidates, particularly from their&#13;
countries, and therefore we needed to adjust the compensation system accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
So while there was not unanimity--far from unanimity--on the particular points, there was&#13;
general discomfort with the overall system. And we were finding it very difficult. Each year it&#13;
was becoming increasingly difficult to justify the increase, even though we felt we were being&#13;
thoroughly professional in applying the various Kafka formulae. We had several years where if&#13;
one ED had switched we wouldn't have the compensation increase. So there was unanimity that&#13;
it had to be changed.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What about Board-Management relations in the context of decision making in HR? A lot of&#13;
people are confused about who decides what.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, I think the reality is quite clear. Other than the President and the Director&#13;
General of Operations Evaluation, the Board does not make HR decisions. That doesn't mean&#13;
that we don't have to respond to Board pressures; e.g., on diversity. But even here the Board is&#13;
tom. When you have a discussion on diversity in the Board, most Board members talk about it&#13;
entirely in terms of their own nationality, so diversity for the Japanese ED or for the Saudi ED&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Richard D. Stern&#13;
                               January 18 and 19,2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                         25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
just means how many Saudis or Japanese you've got and why haven't you got more. I was under&#13;
tremendous pressure in the last three or four years from some of the under-represented&#13;
nationalities such as the Spaniards, Italians, and the Japanese to improve their representation. I&#13;
had to go on quite a few high-level recruitment missions to try to satisfy them. Now, at the same&#13;
time, I have to persuade the Bank managers to take under-represented interests. We made some&#13;
special efforts, we did make some improvement, but progress will inevitably be slow as we have&#13;
rightly resisted any compromise on quality.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Is there a country quota in the YP program?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: No, there is no quota. In contrast to mid-level recruitment, there's an abundant supply&#13;
of well qualified candidates from all regions. You balance it geographically. Initially, I would&#13;
tell the Selection Committee each year, "Look, we're short of Italians, Saudis, and Japanese."&#13;
They would come back and say, "Look, we found five or six Japanese who are great and can&#13;
make it, compared to all the others." Sometimes in a particular year we had trouble finding&#13;
suitably qualified YPs from some under-represented nationality but over time, as far as YPs are&#13;
concerned, it balances out. If the rest of the Bank had the same nationality distribution as the&#13;
YPs, we would have no problem.&#13;
&#13;
By the way, not only is increased nationality diversity a political necessity; staff cultural&#13;
diversity is also critical to the achievement of Bank assistance strategies. The CDF cannot be&#13;
achieved with a culturally one dimensional staff.&#13;
&#13;
We've always resisted a quota. We will continue to do so. But, you know, the HR VP job has a&#13;
very difficult role to play. And, again, if this is the time to be perfectly honest, there is a lot of&#13;
game-playing that goes on, too. You try and do your best, and then you try and manage the&#13;
political consequence when progress on nationality diversity is slower than promised.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Are there any other issues you wish to talk about in reforming the compensation system&#13;
during your tenure as vice president? And, historically, compensation proposals were formulated&#13;
in collaboration with the IMP and discussions with the Staff Association; has this changed?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, in terms of the discussions across the Bank with the Staff Association, to be&#13;
perfectly honest, we were quite proud of the way we did it. We discussed it with focus groups&#13;
(SA and non-SA). To begin with we didn't discuss either the specifics of the employment or the&#13;
compensation reforms. We only discussed proposed prescriptions fairly late in the process. First&#13;
of all, we just described what the current compensation and employment policies were. We then&#13;
focused on what the issues that we had to address were. So, for example, on the compensation&#13;
policies we had a pension system, which was not longevity neutraL It was a traditionally defined&#13;
benefit policy which had enormous incentives for staff to stay in Bank employment until they&#13;
reached some key trigger points. For instance, the penalty that you took if you left the Bank&#13;
before you reached the rule of '85 (age + years of service) was huge. This biased the mix&#13;
between career staff and shorter term staff that are needed for state-of-the-art skills.&#13;
&#13;
We also had employment policies and practices, which discouraged staff to go to the field, a key&#13;
problem given the desire to decentralize the Bank. These are just two examples. We spent a lot&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of time just putting those issues on the table and getting agreement around them. We did that&#13;
with focus groups of all staff levels, the Staff Association; we had task groups working on issues,&#13;
and had whole series of Board seminars where we discussed the matter. We went out of our way&#13;
to get agreement on the issues. We then floated prescriptions. So we went back to them and said,&#13;
"You agreed a few weeks ago that these were the issues. Now, here are ways in which you could&#13;
conceivably tackle them. And here are our preliminary thoughts on the costs and benefits of the&#13;
possible prescriptions." And then we had that discussion. Then we finally came up with&#13;
proposals and again floated these widely before we finalized them.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What about compensation proposals in collaboration with the IMF?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: One of the issues was whether we should continue to link with the IMF; i.e., the so-&#13;
called "parallelism." The arguments for would have been that we live in Washington and we do&#13;
broadly similar work. The arguments against were that we are a much more complex&#13;
organization than the Fund, we have all sorts of categories of staff and professionals that they&#13;
don't have. Their staff come from very different labor markets, which is broadly homogeneous:&#13;
central bankers. We recruit people from a large number of very different labor markets; e.g.,&#13;
finance and NGOs. These markets have very different compensation.&#13;
&#13;
One of the questions was should we have a system of functional pay within the Bank, where you&#13;
have different professional streams having very different salaries? There are quite a few&#13;
organizations that do that. Such an approach would bring most salaries far more in line with the&#13;
market. We then said, "But there are some problems. We want staff to be able to move from one&#13;
function to the other. We don't want to undermine the morale of the staff in a unified Bank." So,&#13;
we put it all on the table and said, "Look, tell us what you think." In other words, we wanted to&#13;
give all staff, Management and Board a chance not just to sit there and criticize, but to engage in&#13;
the issues and build a consensus so that when we did come up with a proposal, it would easily go&#13;
through. And I think we actually achieved this.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, still on compensation, how has that affected recruitment? And is the Bank still&#13;
competitive in attracting the right caliber staff?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: There is no evidence that we're having problems in recruiting because of&#13;
compensation. We monitor that very closely. Of course, there remain a couple of categories&#13;
where we've always had trouble. Treasury always has trouble recruiting and keeping traders, but,&#13;
a good trader on Wall Street will get close to $1,000,000 a year compared to the Bank paying&#13;
them $1 00,000; you can't reform the compensation system to handle that. So what happens is&#13;
they get good training here, good experience, and far more responsibility than they get on the&#13;
Wall Street. Then, after a year or two, they go to Wall Street. But you should also put it into&#13;
perspective. We're talking about ten or fifteen people out of the 600 or 700 who are being&#13;
recruited a year.&#13;
&#13;
We partially mitigated the problems by introducing recruitment bonuses and salary premiums in&#13;
the compensation reform. They are not incredibly large, but can be used on a selective basis if&#13;
there is a retention or recruitment problem. And we have used them, although not very much, in&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  27&#13;

&#13;
the first year. You can get up to three months pay. Each manager has to justify that. And we've&#13;
had a few of them, about a dozen or so. And we control that quite tightly.&#13;
&#13;
I would argue that overall the Bank's compensation system is now more competitive than it was.&#13;
But because of grandfathering some of the relative pay, line adjustments will only change slowly&#13;
over time. The pay line will gradually move from a straight line to one thafs a steeper curve.&#13;
And so you will see the salaries ofthe highest grade professionals and managers go up relatively&#13;
faster than that of the support staff. That's not widely understood. And again, if you want to be&#13;
perfectly honest, that was part of the political strategy of selling the new approach.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, in your opinion, what will be the effect on staff turnover, since historically the Bank&#13;
has had a low turnover rate which, as you have said earlier, really presented a constraint in&#13;
recruiting new and good people?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I don't know what's going to happen. But what has happened in the last three years is&#13;
that the turnover has been phenomenal, possibly to the point where it was too fast.&#13;
&#13;
Q: But only for that period?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yes, but only in that period ...&#13;
&#13;
Q: Will it continue?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: In that period, 3,000 staffhad left and 3,000 staffhadjoined. Most people don't&#13;
recognize what a huge turnover rate we had. We turned over a third of the staff in the last three&#13;
years. Now it's for a variety of reasons. One was the NRS transition. So, of the 3,000 NRS staff,&#13;
I ,500 came in and 1,500 left--didn't make it through the screening or decided that they were not&#13;
even going to try. So that's a one-time thing. Seven hundred people were also separated through&#13;
redundancies or mutually agreed packages. And there'll be another hundred or so this year. Then&#13;
we recruited, again on a one-time basis, between 700-800 and I ,000 new people in the field&#13;
consistent with the decentralization strategy. Others also left due to the pension reform which&#13;
took away some ofthe penalties to early retirement. So it's hard to predict future natural attrition&#13;
based on recent experience.&#13;
&#13;
Q: And the effect on consultants and the use of consultants?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, the consultants, that's another story.&#13;
&#13;
But just to finish on attrition, I think that if you asked us what would have been our intention, it&#13;
would have been that the traditional rate of three or four percent would have increased to about&#13;
seven or eight percent. During the earlier discussions on the reforms, we did discuss whether&#13;
there we should have any long-temi staff at all. The argument was that if the Bank was going to&#13;
be a knowledge bank and remain on the cusp of knowledge and the agenda is going to keep on&#13;
changing, then we should be like OECD [Organization for Economic Co-operation and&#13;
Development] and only have five-year appointments. That way we could continuously recruit the&#13;
state of the art. And there were not a lot of proponents of that view. The other side was, the Bank&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
is a long-term development institution. Development is an integrated topic, you change by doing.&#13;
Moreover we are engaged in long-term dialogues and relationships with countries. You can't do&#13;
that with a staff that has no continuity. So the issue became what was the right balance between&#13;
long-term and short-term staff. Some people said it should be 50-50, some thought it should be&#13;
70-30 longer term and shorter term staff. We therefore developed two staff categories--open-&#13;
ended and fixed-term--and decided to let the operational managers determine the balance in&#13;
practice. How this works in practice remains to be seen.&#13;
&#13;
On the consultants, there has always been a big debate about what that ratio should be; i.e., the&#13;
balance between contract staff and consultants. It relates to the need to quickly access certain&#13;
skills and to the flexibility of managing a work program which can fluctuate quite dramatically&#13;
over the years. Just after I joined, while I was still deputy VP, we put together a task force which&#13;
was led by Shengman Zhang. We deliberately went out and got some of the strongest managers&#13;
in the Bank to be on it, including the ones who understood the budget. So we got people like&#13;
Praful Patel and Anil Sood at that time to sit do\\n and discuss precisely that question. And, it&#13;
related to two things: this group recommended that the ratio of long-term staff and consultants&#13;
should be in the 65 percent to 70 percent range. We also recommended that this ratio be&#13;
mandated.&#13;
&#13;
We ran into a brick wall, as some of these people in the working group who had supported this&#13;
conclusion quite strongly got the once over when they went back to their VPUs [vice-presidential&#13;
units]. They came back like dogs with their tails between their legs, basically saying, "Well,&#13;
maybe we were a bit too strident. We were told that we were undermining managerial&#13;
responsibility, that managers should be allowed to determine what their ratio should be, that I&#13;
was being bureaucratic and was an 'out-of-date' central planner." So we made a recommendation&#13;
but it was not mandated.&#13;
&#13;
If we had done what we said we should do three years ago, we wouldn't be in this current&#13;
staffing crisis, because what happened was that the regional managements misjudged the soft&#13;
landing on the budget. The SAP [computer software program] sent some confusing signals. So&#13;
all the regions ended up with staffing ratios close to 100 percent of budget, and that's why they're&#13;
all cutting back now. Our failure to mandate those ceilings was one of my biggest regrets, that I&#13;
should have just told the MDs that they were chickening out. I should have been more forceful.&#13;
Of course, behavioral changes take time. As a consequence of the current crisis, the regional&#13;
management now accepts the need for mandated ratios. If you really can virtually manage the&#13;
sector staff across the Bank, if you can really get regional country sector directors to promote&#13;
and encourage staff trade and have enough honesty between the managers to move people&#13;
around short-term, you could probably go with higher ratios. It would also be consistent with the&#13;
"knowledge bank" providing "just in time" best practice to a client from regional experience; one&#13;
of the key attributes of a knowledge bank is providing regional experience. However, it requires&#13;
a major change in institutional behavior. Some senior managers believe that this can only be&#13;
achieved through organizational solutions; i.e., creating global departments like we had in earlier&#13;
periods of Bank history.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In 1971?&#13;

                              January 18 and 19, 2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Yes. The reason that we got rid ofthem was because they weren't country responsive,&#13;
but then we didn't have country directors in the field, and country managers control country&#13;
assistance budgets. However, after many organizational changes, my own view is that it is&#13;
behavior, which is the fundamentaL&#13;
&#13;
Q: Want to talk a little bit about what you think has been accomplished or still needs to be done&#13;
in regard to gender, racial, and representational issues in recruitment? You've already talked a&#13;
little about the representation issue.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Assuming we never go for a quota system (it would be a terrible mistake), I'm now&#13;
convinced that the only way that we can tackle gender, race, and nationality issues (we'll&#13;
eventually succeed on race and gender, but never totally on nationality) is through a fully&#13;
institutional approach which in tum requires the development of a much more systematic&#13;
candidate governing system on the Bank's part. We have a built-in advantage if we want to use&#13;
it. Recruitment is about networking. Our professional staff understand the agenda and our skill&#13;
needs. We work in 100 plus countries and have 130+ nationalities. Our staff either know all the&#13;
potential candidates, or they know someone who does know. If the sector boards increasingly&#13;
and enthusiastically take the lead, and we get the staff engaged and succeed in our diversity goals&#13;
(by the way, we did consider giving staff a bonus of$500 or $1,000 dollars ifthey identified&#13;
someone who is eventually recruited; I still think we should introduce such an incentive, not&#13;
because it's going to materially affect anybody's compensation, but it would send the right signal)&#13;
I'm quite confident that we can make significant progress.&#13;
&#13;
I think perhaps more difficult will be breaking down the cultural barriers inside the place.&#13;
These barriers do remain pretty strong. That will take time to break down. We've got lots of&#13;
mentoring programs and lots of behavioral awareness programs. And more importantly, the&#13;
Bank's substantive agenda, the CDF is in place. If you don't have a group of professionals who&#13;
can empathize, think and look like the people that they're working with, you're not going to be&#13;
effective. I mean, it's as simple as that, So I think all these things are mutually reinforcing. But&#13;
building the all inclusive culture will be a long-term process. Getting to a full 50-50 on the&#13;
gender side, now we have 35-38 percent women, something like that. The last ten percent will be&#13;
tough. But I'm actually quite confident that this target will be achieved.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How have the new leadership development programs and staff training programs improved&#13;
on previous efforts at career development, in terms of keeping staff skills current as well as&#13;
maintaining the tradition of promoting from within?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, there are a lot of questions there. Let me start with professional training. I think&#13;
the attempt to have the networks take charge of professional training, to identifY where the gaps&#13;
are in terms of the current agenda and to put on the right courses, have actually been quite&#13;
successful. The annual sector weeks organized by the sectors really are state-of-the-art programs.&#13;
They have resulted in a very high-level of debate and attracted some of the best outside&#13;
expertise. For example, Energy Week on rural energy and energy for the poor was a state-of-the-&#13;
art primer on these issues; it also sent a clear message on the future strategic direction of the&#13;
Bank with regard to professional training in this thematic area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Richard D. Stern&#13;
                              January 18 and 19, 2001 Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There's a bit of a disconnect between some ofthe networks and WBI (World Bank Institute] in&#13;
terms of training delivery. WBI, again, at least in my view, has tried to capture too much of the&#13;
of the training delivery, so there's been an element of supply driven from the WBI, but I fault the&#13;
networks for that. I think the sector departments as the professional practitioners just should not&#13;
let that happen. They should develop and drive the training agenda. Some of the thematic groups,&#13;
which are an integral part of the knowledge bank, have played a key role in keeping the Bank at&#13;
the state of the art level in their respective areas. They have proved to be an effective vehicle for&#13;
collecting and disseminating "state of the art" knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
What hasn't worked so well on the professional side is the day-to-day professional mentoring.&#13;
When I joined the Bank, it had a much more formal hierarchical structure, and the span of&#13;
control of the managers and the supervisors was also quite small. So when I came off the YP&#13;
program, I was supervised by people who probably had only four, five, or six people reporting to&#13;
them. You had people who were willing to guide you, coach you, smile when you made&#13;
mistakes. You didn't mind making mistakes. While staff in the new Bank have access to the&#13;
expertise that they need (through the networks) it's not obvious that they always take advantage&#13;
of these resources; none work on identifying them. Most training is on the job; therefore, the&#13;
availability of detailed day-to-day professional guidance is critical. So the problem is really not&#13;
so much with the training delivery mechanisms and the articulation of the training needs, it's&#13;
more with the structure and the way we run the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So you're saying that one problem here is that there's not enough feedback?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I don't mean formal feedback but the day-to-day professional supervision--learning&#13;
from a few gray hairs and that sort of stuff. That works less smoothly in the network bank, as&#13;
opposed to our earlier hierarchical organization. On the managerial side, we have in place now&#13;
what everybody says is a state-of-the-art training system. The EDP (Executive Development&#13;
Program) at Harvard is an excellent program; I think it would qe hard to get a better program.&#13;
The behavioral training for managers and particularly first-time managers has also improved.&#13;
The techniques the Bank uses to collect behavioral feedback are very well known in the trade.&#13;
For the first time in the history of the Bank, we have a pretty cohesive and coherent set of&#13;
managerial training, particularly for those implementing the new CDF approach. We have also&#13;
developed similar training programs to support teams. I'm a little bit more skeptical on this latter&#13;
sort of training because it's very expensive; you wonder whether you're getting much benefit&#13;
from the high-priced consultants. These training programs have been complemented by much&#13;
more systematic managerial evaluation, succession planning, and management development&#13;
systems.&#13;
&#13;
The LAMP program (Leadership Asset Management Program) systematically obtains&#13;
information from each of the VPs about who are the~r problem managers, what remedial help can&#13;
be provided, when we need to remove them when such medicinal measures fail, and if their&#13;
problem managers need remedial help or do we need just to take some action, who are the people&#13;
who are ready now for director and VPs, and who are the people who will be ready a few years&#13;
from now, etcetera. That has become systematized institutionally. We do that once a year. The&#13;
VPs also meet as a group at least once a year where they have very honest discussions on the&#13;
most appropriate next assignments for their managers and their long-term potential.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The problem, once you've agreed on appropriate development actions for particular individuals,&#13;
has been actually to make it to happen. This was one of my biggest frustrations. In contrast to the&#13;
past, the VPs take a corporate rather than a "personal" or "local" view in the discussion.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Following over five years of experience since the establishment of the StaffExchange&#13;
Program in 1995, what's your assessment of its achievements to date?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I think it's been a very successful program. It's given a large number of staff members&#13;
here exposure to the outside while providing the security of the return .. Many of them have been&#13;
able to make quite important and appreciated contributions to the firms and organizations they&#13;
went to. The Bank is profiting greatly from the experience the staff members accumulated when&#13;
working on their exchange assignments. It's also helped tremendously in networking. For&#13;
example, if you've got some staff working in another corporation, and then you go there and say,&#13;
"Look, let's cooperate on something else, and let's work together," it's very powerful. It is very&#13;
expensive, because in the end you're investing in only one person at a time.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How many people, total, have been involved in that kind of a setup?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I can't remember the numbers, but it's not a huge one, maybe 100 seconded in and 100&#13;
seconded out. Given the expenses involved, the program should not be seen just in terms of&#13;
individual self-improvement; I think there are much cheaper and more cost-effective ways to&#13;
achieve the objectives. Rather it should be viewed as a partnership program. You've got to see it&#13;
in terms ofbuilding long-term relationships.&#13;
&#13;
Q: The next question, and you've already touched on this in a number of ways, is on&#13;
decentralization but, in addition to that, outsourcing at the Bank. So, what are the challenges that&#13;
a) decentralization of Bank operations; and b) outsourcing of services in the Bank, present to&#13;
HR?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: In terms of decentralization, we faced a number of major HR challenges. In contrast to&#13;
the past, we now have a consistent set of staff grading criteria irrespective of location. We also,&#13;
for the first time, have a consistent set of compensation policies between headquarters and the&#13;
field. We also have a consistent set of staff development policies and programs but what we're&#13;
finding now as a practical matter is that career development of the local staff is tough, not&#13;
because of problem with the concept, but in delivery. Day to day professional mentoring and&#13;
development in the field is hard because many of the needed resources are located in&#13;
Washington.&#13;
&#13;
Now, again, some sector networks are beginning to take the initiative in this area. In several&#13;
regions, now, local staff are beginning to work for other local offices. This way staff get the&#13;
needed exposure to a wide range of issues. So, let's say that you send out an irrigation mission to&#13;
Indonesia, and then the person in the China office might join the team. For example,&#13;
agriculturists in the Ethiopia office have joined missions in Zimbabwe and Zambia. HR staff&#13;
can't manage the process; the sector directors and the country directors have to see such an "on&#13;
the job training" as key part of their jobs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Richard D. Stern&#13;
                              January 18 and 19, 2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Delivering formal training to the field is also quite difficult and expensive. We've had a few hub&#13;
courses. We bring people here. But again it's not easy to give them "just in time" training. In&#13;
general field staff still feel somewhat forgotten, often saying, "Look, people don't know us out&#13;
here." But they shouldn't ignore the fundamental changes that have taken place. The ratios of&#13;
field staff to headquarters are now significant. We have professional staff in the field. The 1&#13;
ocal staff itself is very pushy and articulate. They will demand and ultimately get the training and&#13;
development they need. They will also evaluate country directors/managers' performance in&#13;
acquiring and securing that training. So I think the dynamics are in there, but one shouldn't&#13;
underestimate that it will be a difficult and lengthy process.&#13;
&#13;
Outsourcing is a totally separate issue. We're decentralizing because we want people locally who&#13;
understand what is needed, who can interact with clients on a day to day basis and respond to&#13;
their needs while at the same time ensuring that we have an integrated and coherent global&#13;
professional approach. On outsourcing, all you're saying is, "Here is a routine task which we can&#13;
accomplish more cheaply outside, and it's not part of the core business." We are making some&#13;
progress on that. The Controllers group will be outsourcing part of its function to India. The&#13;
ensuing job losses at HQ have to be managed sensitively. By actively pursuing outsourcing, we&#13;
are doing nothing different from what other multinational corporate organizations are doing, so&#13;
why not exploit these sunk costs to effectively outsource. We can procure some ofthese services&#13;
at a quarter ofthe cost. And we're a development institution. For the first time we have a global&#13;
office and IT infrastructure in place. We need to cushion the transition. We need to give people&#13;
special compensation. With the current fragmented organization, these will be limited to&#13;
outsourcing some functions. To be more explicit, many of the routine operations can be&#13;
outsourced, but a lot of those operations are fragmented because of our regional structures. As a&#13;
practical matter it may not be easy to bring it all together and then outsource.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Actually, the next question has to do with the role of HR in staff grievances and conflict&#13;
resolution?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, the philosophy behind the conflict resolution reforms which were enacted over&#13;
the last two or three years was to actually separate the conflict resolution process from HR. The&#13;
philosophy was that as an interested party, HR is very often the function that is seen as the&#13;
"aggriever" and therefore should not be part of the process. I've have no problem in the appeals&#13;
committee and the mediators and the Ombudsman being totally independent from HR. In fact,&#13;
they should be. But I think we may have gone too far because HR also has to be part of the&#13;
solution. If you separate the conflict resolution process entirely, it is difficult for HR to play this&#13;
role. We have also relied too heavily on a legal approach to solve complex problems. More work&#13;
and thought is needed in this area. We need to learn from lessons of experience of the new&#13;
systems and make the necessary mid-course corrections.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How would you assess the various evaluation mechanisms currently in place within the&#13;
HR function for measuring success in terms of the services it provides?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: In terms of the benefit services that HR provides, the overall management of the&#13;
insurance schemes, it's obviously got a monopoly. However, we have a very aggressive staff that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Richard D. Stern&#13;

&amp;#12;    .                                                                                                                     33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    ~doesn't  mind what they say to anybody in the form of feedback. So as a practical matter, we&#13;
     , have market feedback. As VP for HR, I used to get lots of highly sarcastic, well-drafted notes&#13;
      (about why someone had been cheated out of something or other by some little bureaucrat&#13;
    Â·~somewhere. Now, 70 percent of the time they were totally self-serving and 30 percent of the time&#13;
      ::.  probably had a point. Again, I never saw the staff hesitant to monitor our performance.&#13;
&#13;
                         we had a major problem with Aetna, our medical insurance coJmp1an&#13;
                                York Life].&#13;
                                       But agam, the monitoring mechanisms were just there; i.e., staff feedback.&#13;
                          it comes to other things, it's more difficult. Having said this, there is a need to add other&#13;
        i""i'1"'"' ....'J""''" mechanisms including building on the attitude surveys.&#13;
&#13;
          Q: On the subject of the Bank's presidents, what are your perceptions of President Wolfensohn&#13;
          and his mission? Some observers have maintained that he was taking on too much for the Bank&#13;
          and that a stronger focus on the main issues would be wise.&#13;
&#13;
          STERN: Well, I think in Jim Wolfensohn we've got a leader for the first time since McNamara.&#13;
          We've got someonewho has fixed the external image of the Bank almost single-handedly. We've&#13;
          got someone who, by sheer force of his intellect and personality, has been able to take us into&#13;
          directions that many of us would not have considered feasible, not that they weren't relevant or&#13;
          pertinent but that we as staff doubted that we had the potential clout or influence to do. For&#13;
          example, corruption, the whole corruption agenda: there was a lot of "tut-tutting" around the&#13;
          Bank, but staff said, "Well, of course it's a problem, but what can we do about it?" He proved us&#13;
          wrong.&#13;
&#13;
         He has articulated the CDF. I firmly believe that good staff were already following a CDF&#13;
       Â· approach. However, he gave it impetus and expanded it to the rest of the world. He was also&#13;
         instrumental in promoting HIPC [highly-indebted poor countries]. So Preston, [Barber B.]&#13;
         Conable, or [Alden W.] Clausen never had this impact; they were not leaders. And Jim, being a&#13;
         quick read, quickly absorbed development issues. A particularly good example of that is what he&#13;
         is doing now on information technology and the digital divide. Again, through sheer force of his&#13;
   . personality, he is forcing the Bank to take a lead on Information Communications Technology&#13;
  Â·Â·~ (ICT). Theoretically you can use ICT to put the Library of Congress into a rural village in Africa&#13;
  . .:S with the Internet. None of us yet know the detailed prescriptions for how to do it, but it clearly is&#13;
  ~ something incredibly important. And if we, as good development practitioners, are left to our&#13;
    ';! own devices, we probably have tackled these issues but ten years from now and not tomorrow.&#13;
   ~ Jim understands that and is determined to overcome it. These are the true attributes of a leader.&#13;
    Â·~&#13;
&#13;
~    Now having said that, some of his achievements have come at a very high cost. He does try to&#13;
~ \ run the Bank as an extension of his own personality. You can't run a bank of 11,000 people like&#13;
:!: . ,&#13;
     that. To run an organization effectively, there's got to be a degree of predictability. Managers&#13;
  'N and staff have to have the necessary degree of self-confidence. There's got to be a de!!fee of&#13;
~ .Â§ empowerment, particularly for senior managers. And Jim,&#13;
     "f                     finds it difficult to do that.&#13;
    ~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                     Richard D. Stern&#13;
                                           January 18 and 19, 2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I sincerely feel that much of the outburst that occurred when my brother was appointed Chief&#13;
Economist was not strictly related to his appointment. It was a way to get at Jim. Now, if you&#13;
combine the above with the reality that the Bank staff are a very conservative bunch of people, if&#13;
you combine it with the downsizing and related uncertainties of recent years, staff invariably&#13;
suffered. We should also realize that Bank staff have a tendency to be negative and to moan! The&#13;
glass is always half empty rather than half full; it's always someone else's fault. It's never your&#13;
own. But that's the environment, and those are the behavioral things that we've been trying to&#13;
change over the years. So, yes, Jim is the first leader since McNamara. He has made a very major&#13;
contribution but it has come at a high cost. We'll see what happens for the remainder of his term.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In answering that question, you've touched on some of the other presidents in between there.&#13;
Is there anything else you want to add about Wolfensohn's predecessors?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: I think Preston actually knew how to run a large organization very well, much better&#13;
than Jim. That's what he'd done at Morgan Stanley. And when he put into place the layer of&#13;
Managing Directors and said, "When you talk to an MD, you're talking to me, because we're a&#13;
seamless team," that actually happened. But the guy was sick, the guy was tired, he didn't&#13;
understand the development mission very welL He might have been able to do so in earlier years&#13;
or been capable of learning it. So I think Preston was someone who might have had the potential,&#13;
but he was too old or too tired. Having said that, he commanded great respect by those that were&#13;
close to him.&#13;
&#13;
I think that if history books on Conable and Clausen are ever written, they will be seen to be&#13;
pretty much nonentities. They never understood the key mission of the Bank and had very little&#13;
impact. Well, Conable had a big impact through the '87 reorganization, but, in no sense did he&#13;
direct that reorganization, other than allow it to happen.&#13;
&#13;
I think McNamara was, like Jim, a true leader. However, this needs to be put into historical&#13;
context. McNamara was running the Bank in the '70s. It was a very different world. The world&#13;
was then seen as a simpler place. I meant, it probably wasn't, but that was the way we saw it.&#13;
The Bank's agenda was expanding rapidly, but it was nothing as complex in the 1970s as it is&#13;
now. We didn't persuade people; we told them what we wanted! So it was a very different world.&#13;
I mean, I don't think Bob McNamara could have run the current Bank. I don't think he&#13;
understands the complexities of the world we live in now. The idea of building partnerships and&#13;
participatory relationships and managing through consensus, Bob would have had no problem&#13;
with the concept, but I doubt that he would have been able to accept the inevitable uncertainty&#13;
that goes with such an approach. That would have been anathema to Bob. But he was superb at&#13;
articulating a vision and molding the Bank into a machine to deliver that vision, whether it was&#13;
right or wrong. Look, he made a speech on rural development at the Nairobi Annual Meetings in&#13;
'73, and within three or four years the Bank's machine was crunching out rural development&#13;
projects all over the world. In '74 or '75 he made his urban speech and we then did the same&#13;
thing.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Right, as a matter of managing or his method or organization?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Actually, he understood that extremely well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                              January 18 and 19,2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: So, how would you sum up then the qualities, from what you've said about these presidents,&#13;
what does it take to be president of the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: The criteria and attributes of a successful president change dramatically over time. The&#13;
world and our understanding of development issues rightly and inevitably evolve, so therefore&#13;
you've got to be awfully careful in articulating such attributes.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What about Eugene Black?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Eugene Black and George Woods basically had the job of establishing a sound and&#13;
respected institution that had credibility on the capital markets, which they did very well. They&#13;
created a well managed, professional and financially sound entity. McNamara turned this place&#13;
into a meaningful development institution with serious global influence. Jim understood&#13;
intuitively and intellectually the new world that we live in: a world of many players, a world&#13;
where you have to exercise influence on governments and civil society, not command and&#13;
control them. He's a superb salesman, and he's able to bring together external coalitions.&#13;
&#13;
Don't forget that being a successful president of the World Bank probably is one of the toughest&#13;
jobs in the world. You've got to be a great external politician and salesman. You've got to&#13;
understand development. You have to absorb complex agendas. You have to have a feel for&#13;
macro as well as micro economics. You have to now be able to form partnerships and&#13;
relationships with all the key actors, all the way from the NGOs and the faith community right&#13;
through to the captains of industries and heads of government. And you have to be able to run a&#13;
large organization. And the honest answer is, there's nobody who can do all that. Any president&#13;
will fall short on some aspects. Does the Bank now need to rationalize in a more coherent and&#13;
predictable way? Absolutely! Is Jim capable of doing that? Probably not. But he will ensure that&#13;
the Bank enhances its development impact. In the end, that is why we are here and why most of&#13;
us enjoy our work.&#13;
&#13;
Q: We would like to tum to some further or final reflections. Our question concerns the&#13;
relevance of the Bank, and you have touched on this, too. The need for the Bank to change in&#13;
order to maintain its relevance and effectiveness in the global economy has necessitated it to&#13;
periodically reorganize. You've experienced in your career three major reorganizations: '72, '87,&#13;
and '97, in addition to what seemed to be a continuum between '87 and '97, which we talked&#13;
about also. Considering the inherent implications of such frequent organizational changes such&#13;
as lack of continuity, low morale, adoption of a survival mentality stemming from job&#13;
uncertainty and the fear of redundancy, in your opinion do projected long-term benefits outweigh&#13;
short-term costs of such frequent organizational changes?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Let me tell you, the more and more I've gone through these organizational changes,&#13;
the less confidence I have in them. That's not to say that you should not seek the most&#13;
appropriate organizational structure, but that other matters are more important. I'm more and&#13;
more convinced that the real issues in organizational effectiveness have to do .with behavior. If&#13;
you can create a shared image of the current strategic priorities and mission of the institution&#13;
(which will obviously change over time), and if you can empower staff giving them the freedom&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Richard D. Stern&#13;
                              January 18 and 19, 2001- Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to operate within that broad mission understanding, I believe you can do an awful lot. So I'm not&#13;
arguing that organization is unimportant, but I think there is a tendency to over emphasize&#13;
organizational issues. Yes, in retrospect, I think we could have had less reorganizations. We&#13;
could have had less absolutism in pursuing the right organizational model.&#13;
&#13;
In retrospect, we should have given greater weight to promoting and cultivating the needed&#13;
behavior and the strategic understandings, rather than on the organization itself. If I had it all&#13;
over again, I would say, "Focus on basic incentives and the culture of the institution and&#13;
reorganize less frequently."&#13;
&#13;
Q: What do you think your contribution will be to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: All I can tell you is that I think I've been pretty consistent throughout my career. I've&#13;
always tried to be pragmatic, but base that pragmatism on the key strategic priorities we faced at&#13;
any particular time! I've always tried to get my staff to follow that approach. Or let me put it&#13;
another way around, there were three people in this Bank who've really impacted on me. Did I&#13;
mention that earlier? There was Ping Loh, who taught me about being pragmatic and to find the&#13;
"hot buttons" (as he used to call it) in terms of impacting on our client countries; for example,&#13;
what are the key issues that worry them? how can you use them? Stanley Please taught me that a&#13;
country-based approach was important; all issues clearly had to be faced within a country&#13;
context. And Shahid Husain taught me that you can do both together. And that philosophy has&#13;
guided me and I've tried to apply that fairly consistently.&#13;
&#13;
That's what I have tried to teach others. I think I have had some impact there. When staff would&#13;
seek my guidance, they would often say, "Look, you know, this is the problem that I've got. This&#13;
is what the Bank policy says. This is what the rules say. This is what the procurement rules say."&#13;
I always used to say, "Forget about all that. That doesn't matter. Ask yourself what are you trying&#13;
to do? What is the underlying problem/issue? How do I reconcile them? Why are you here?''&#13;
Figure that out, and you'll know what to do.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What have you learned from your experience at the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Well, I've also learned that however good your analysis, you are more often than not&#13;
likely to be wrong! Development is very complex and difficult. The chances that you have the&#13;
right answer, policy or operational prescription are therefore not high! And so you must be&#13;
humble and be willing to recognize your mistakes and to redesign your approaches when you&#13;
realize you got it wrong. That was exactly the issue we faced in Arun. The staff and managers&#13;
who made the early decisions could not face up to the fact that they just got it wrong. The cost of&#13;
undoing it was that you lost a little bit of credibility, and you lost a little bit of face within the&#13;
Institution. But that's very hard for a lot of people in institutions to do.&#13;
&#13;
Q: And what would your advice then be to current managers?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: You need self-confidence, humility; you need to constantly work from first principles;&#13;
and you need to operate as a team. And not to blame others. Take responsibility and be&#13;
pragmatic. The Bank really allows you to do anything. That's what makes it so much fun!&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: What advice would you give people entering the YP program?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Have a lot of fun. Don't think you know all the answers. Use your professional&#13;
education and training, but don't trust it. And make sure that you operate as part of a team.&#13;
&#13;
Q: And what has it meant to you personally serving in an institution such as the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Oh, I've had the time of my life! This is a job where you just get paid for having fun.&#13;
It's intellectually fascinating. You get to ask all sorts of tough questions and then have to&#13;
develop and implement practical and policy prescriptions. No, I have no regrets whatsoever!&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, thank you for a wonderful contribution to the Oral History Program.&#13;
&#13;
STERN: Thanks!&#13;

            East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region as division chiefs for
            the country programs department division C (1978-1983) and
            the industry department division 4 (1983-1987); in the Asia
            region as division chief for the industry and energy
            operations country department 3 (1987-19991); as unit chief
