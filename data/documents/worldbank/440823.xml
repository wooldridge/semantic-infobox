Abstract&#13;
Better management of the public service requires action on three&#13;
fronts: the structural barriers to efficient management must be removed; the&#13;
quality and allocation of human, financial, informational, and physical&#13;
resources must be improved; and the systems and processes used for managing&#13;
these resources must be reoriented toward performance goals. Of these, the&#13;
paper focuses mainly on ways of better managing the human resources of the&#13;
public service.&#13;
Public service employment in developing countries has been growing&#13;
about four times as fast: as in developed countries in recent years, partly in&#13;
response to the demand for improved public services. In many countries,&#13;
overstaffing at lower levels is accompanied by shortages of professional and&#13;
technical staff. These shortages are exacerbated by the "brain drain."&#13;
Problems of public service training systems in developing countries&#13;
lead to five policy recommendations: raising the status of the training&#13;
function in government; preparing national training policies and plans;&#13;
forging closer links between training and other areas of personnel management;&#13;
strengthening the links between training, research, and consultancy; and&#13;
expanding international cooperation in training.&#13;
In the personnel management area, the central need is to shift from a&#13;
philosophy of passive administration of personnel policies to one of active&#13;
management of the human resources of the civil service. This requires, among&#13;
other things, clarifying the role and raising the status of the personnel&#13;
function in government, building effective career development systems,&#13;
improving public sector pay and conditions, and linking material and&#13;
nonmaterial incentives more closely to performance.&#13;
The last major issue covered is the applicability of western&#13;
management practices in developing country settings. Although some&#13;
quantitative management techniques that have evolved in developed countries&#13;
can be used successfully in developing countries after some adaptation, the&#13;
transfer of people-oriented qualitative management practices often requires&#13;
considerable tailoring Ito make them consistent with local political and&#13;
cultural realities.&#13;

Foreword&#13;
This study is one in a series of World Bank Staff Working&#13;
Papers devoted to issues of development management. Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1983, they&#13;
provide an in-depth treatment of the subjects dealt with in Part&#13;
II of the Report.. The thirteen papers cover topics ranging from&#13;
comprehensive surveys of management issues in different types of&#13;
public sector institutions (for example, state-owned enterprises,&#13;
the public service, and local government agencies) to broad&#13;
overviews of such subjects as planning, management training,&#13;
technical assistance, corruption, and decentralization.&#13;
The central concern underlying these papers is the search&#13;
for greater efficiency in setting and pursuing development&#13;
goals. The papers focus on the role of the state in this process,&#13;
stress the imporltance of appropriate incentives, and assess the&#13;
effectiveness of alternative institutional arrangements. They&#13;
offer no general prescriptions, as the developing countries are&#13;
too diverse--politically, culturally, and in economic resources--&#13;
to allow the definition of a single strategy.&#13;
The papers draw extensively on the experiences of the&#13;
World Bank and other international agencies.  They were reviewed&#13;
by a wide range of readership from developing and developed&#13;
countries inside and outside the Bank. They were edited by&#13;
Victoria Macintyre. Rhoda Blade-Charest, Banjonglak Duangrat,&#13;
Jaunianne Fawkes, and Carlina Jones prepared the manuscripts for&#13;
publication.&#13;
I hope that these studies will be useful to practitioners&#13;
and academicians of development management around the world.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
Although only 3 out of every 100 inhabitants and 24 out of every 100&#13;
nonagricultural employees in developing countries are public servants, as a&#13;
whole they play a more important role in influencing development than perhaps&#13;
any other group. This influence takes various forms. First, public servants&#13;
play a key role in the setting of public policy agenda and in the formulation&#13;
of policy, even when the actual decisions are taken by persons in positions of&#13;
political authority. Second, public servants implement the formulated&#13;
policies, either directly (for example, in the areas of security and defense,&#13;
protection of justice, education, and health) or indirectly (for example, in&#13;
the implementation of the state's production policies, where they act as an&#13;
intermediary between political authorities and state-owned enterprises).&#13;
Finally, public servants oversee and monitor compliance with the government's&#13;
allocative, redistributive, and regulatory policies by nongovernmental&#13;
organizations. Thus, although the "public administration" component in total&#13;
government spending is relatively small (less than 10 percent) in most&#13;
countries, the role of the public service in policy formulation and&#13;
implementation is high. This implies that poor management of the public&#13;
service has high costs, and that even marginal improvements in management&#13;
capabilities can have important positive effects on development. Hence, the&#13;
purpose of this paper is to explore ways of better managing the public service&#13;
in developing countries.&#13;
The paper does not cover all possible areas of public service&#13;
performance in which improvements are possible. Nor does it cover the&#13;
politics of managing bureaucracies in developing countries. Rather, it&#13;
focuses on managing the human resources of the public service (sections II-V).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
In addition, it touches on culture-management linkages (Section VI). The&#13;
final section of the paper summarizes the key conclusions reached in this&#13;
study and their implications for carrying out management reforms directed at&#13;
the public service.&#13;
Definition of the Public Service&#13;
There are almost as many definitions of the public service as there&#13;
are countries. This partly explains the paucity of reliable comparative data&#13;
on various aspects of the public service. In most countries, the public&#13;
service is defined by legislation specifying the characteristics of either the&#13;
employees or of the employing institutions, or both. In a few countries, such&#13;
as the United Kingdom, the public service is not defined by law or statute;&#13;
instead, its form and function are determined in a more or less pragmatic&#13;
manner. Legislation defining the status of public service staff also varies&#13;
across countries. In most, a special legal system distinct from the general&#13;
labor legislation applies to public servants. In some countries, including&#13;
several in Eastern Europe, however, the general labor legislation applies to&#13;
all workers, including public service employees (ILO 1983b).&#13;
ILO's Joint Committee on the Public Service takes the term "public&#13;
service" to refer to "all persons employed by a public authority, institution&#13;
or body with legal personality of its own" (ILO 1983 b, p.7). That definition&#13;
of public service has been adopted for this paper, with one exception. Since&#13;
management issues of state-owned enterprises (SOE) are discussed separately in&#13;
a companion volume (Shirley, 1983), for the purposes of this study, SOE&#13;
employees are considered to be outside the boundaries of the public service.&#13;
In practical terms, the definition adopted here covers mainly the institutions&#13;
of the central (or federal) government and those of state, local, regional,&#13;
and provincial authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
II. Growth and Composition of Public Service Employment&#13;
There are three common beliefs about public service employment in&#13;
developing countries: (1) that it is "too big"; (2) that it has been growing&#13;
too fast; and (3) that there is too much "fat" in administration. This&#13;
section examines the available evidence on these questions and explores the&#13;
policies developing countries could pursue to control the size and composition&#13;
of the public service.&#13;
Is the Public Service "Too Big"?&#13;
The answer depends on one's definition of "big." Common sense&#13;
dictates that, other things being equal, small countries would need to have a&#13;
relatively bigger public service than big countries (reflecting economies of&#13;
scale) and that richer countries can afford to have a bigger public service&#13;
than poorer ones. Empirical evidence for about 75 countries supports this&#13;
thesis: as per capita income rises, government employment increases on a per&#13;
capita basis, but declines as a share of nonagricultural employment (Heller&#13;
and Tait 1982). Thus, on a per capita basis, industrialized countries of the&#13;
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) now have more&#13;
than twice as many public employees as the developing countries: 77 public&#13;
servants per 1,000 population as against 29 for the 31 developing countries&#13;
surveyed by the IMF. African countries, on the average, have fewer public&#13;
employees per capita than Asian and Latin American countries (Table 1).&#13;
Thus, the empirical evidence supports the view that the public service in&#13;
developing countries, on the average, is not "too big," at least not bigger&#13;
than what would be expected on the basis of their population and level of&#13;
income.&#13;

A somewhat different picture emerges, however, when only the&#13;
nonagricultural sectors of the economy are taken into account. First,&#13;
government employment in developing countries constitutes 26.7 percent of all&#13;
nonagricultural employment, which is higher than the government's share in&#13;
nonagricultural employment in indtLstrialized OECD countries (20.4 percent),&#13;
although there is a wide variatiorL across regions and countries (Table 2).&#13;
In India the rate is as high as 54 percent, followed by 53 percent in Liberia,&#13;
50 percent in Benin, and 46 percent in Tanzania, among the sampled&#13;
countries. The differential between the averages for developing and developed&#13;
countries becomes even wider when employment in nonfinancial public&#13;
enterprises is also taken into account (43.1 percent of nonagricultural&#13;
employment as against 28.5 percent, respectively).&#13;
Second, employment in the public service is more heavily concentrated&#13;
in the central government in developing countries than in the developed&#13;
countries. State and local government accounts for about 57 percent of total&#13;
&#13;

government employment: in industrial countries, compared with only 15 percent&#13;
in developing countries. In the African countries surveyed, only 6.4 percent&#13;
of the public service employment is at the local level, compared with 20.8&#13;
percent in Latin American and 36.5 percent in Asian countries.&#13;
Thus, regarding the first question posed, it can be concluded that in&#13;
terms of its overall size the public service in developing countries, on the&#13;
average, is not big. Size has become an issue mainly because a larger share&#13;
of the salaried jobs is in government in the developing countries as compared&#13;
with the developed countries. The concentration of public service jobs at the&#13;
central government le.vel at the expense of lower levels of government has&#13;
helped to fortify the "big bureaucracy" perception, as has the rapid growth of&#13;
the public service irt most developing countries.&#13;
Is the Public Service Growing "Too Fast"?&#13;
Here, too, there are no objective yardsticks one can use to determine&#13;
if the public service of a country is growing "too fast." Clearly the level&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
of development is an important factor: most countries that are in early&#13;
stages of development and that have extremely low levels of&#13;
institutionalization find it necessary to rely heavily on the machinery of the&#13;
state to produce goods and deliver the most essential services. These&#13;
countries have therefore expanded employment in their public service much&#13;
faster than those with higher levels of institutionalization. The growth of&#13;
today's industrial countries fits t:his general pattern, as do the experiences&#13;
of the more advanced developing countries.&#13;
A second important factor is the role that the state plays in the&#13;
economy and society. A prominent role by the state in the production of goods&#13;
and services and the regulation of economic activity necessarily requires a&#13;
larger public service. In such cases the growth in public service employment,&#13;
in general, parallels the growth in the demand for government service. The&#13;
number of primary school students in developing countries, for example,&#13;
increased from about 117 million in 1980 to more than 236 million in 1975.&#13;
This increase had to be matched by a similar growth in the number of teachers,&#13;
who, in most countries, are public servants. This growth is likely to&#13;
continue, although possibly at a reduced rate, wherever governments have&#13;
nearly achieved universal primary education.&#13;
A third major reason for growth in public service employment is the&#13;
desire of some governments to improve tribal, ethnic, or regional&#13;
representation, or to use employment as a means for combating unemployment.&#13;
The governments of Egypt, the Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritius, and Sri Lanka,&#13;
among others, have at various times adopted explicit roles as the "employer of&#13;
last resort," particularly of university graduates. In Egypt, according to an&#13;
ILO estimate, overstaffing was close to 42 percent of the total civil service&#13;
employment in 1976 (Hansen and Radwan 1982). A recent consultant's study of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
the headquarters offices of two ministries in a West Africa country identified&#13;
6,000 out of a staff of 6,800 as redundant. In some oil-rich countries&#13;
governments have used the hiring of extra staff as a means of distributing&#13;
petroleum revenues.&#13;
It is not possible to disentangle the effects of these three factors&#13;
on the growth of public service employment. The empirical data for the middle&#13;
and late 1970s shows that public service employment in developing countries&#13;
increased about four times as fast as in developed countries (the median&#13;
annual growth rate for the 20 developing countries listed in Table 3 is 7.5&#13;
percent as compared with a median of 2.0 percent for the 15 industrial&#13;
countries.) Although this difference in the median growth rates is quite&#13;
pronounced, it is not possible to state categorically that government&#13;
employment in developing countries is growing "too fast." For that type of&#13;
assessment, individual country circumstances must be examined over a longer&#13;
time period.&#13;
Two general trends could potentially account for the differences in&#13;
the growth rates in Table 3. First, as noted above, the developing countries&#13;
tended to use public service employment as a means of alleviating unemployment&#13;
more than the industrial countries did. Second, industrial countries as a&#13;
group--prompted partly by the recession and the need for fiscal stringency-&#13;
took tighter measures to limit the growth of their public service.&#13;
Regarding the first, overstaffing the public service imposes a&#13;
financial burden on the state, undermines morale, and presents a major&#13;
obstacle to efficient management. Expanding regular government employment&#13;
does not help to solve the shortage of productive employment opportunities in&#13;
the economy. Since most developing countries cannot afford unemployment&#13;
insurance schemes, for short-term unemployment relief temporary public works&#13;

Regarding the second, after an increase in the share of the public&#13;
sector in total employment from 11.6 percent in 1960 to 18 percent in 1979&#13;
(OECD 1982), several industrial countries have recently initiated action to&#13;
limit the size of their public service. In the Federal Republic of Germany,&#13;
for example, the growth of the federal civil service has been slowed down&#13;
since 1975, and a complete freeze on new federal jobs was recently&#13;
introduced. A similar freeze has been in operation in Switzerland since&#13;
1974. The government of Japan cut the number of personnel in the national&#13;
public service by 143,000 between 1969 and 1981 and the United States reduced&#13;
federal government employment by 300,000 in 1981.  In the United Kingdom, the&#13;
aim is to trim the size of the central government by 640,000 over the next two&#13;
years, reducing government employment to its lowest level since 1945. And&#13;
zero growth is the current policy in Canada (ILO 1983a).&#13;
Only a few developing countries have initiated similar actions. The&#13;
military government in Turkey placed a freeze on hiring in 1980, and only 54&#13;
new entrants joined the public service in 1981, although the policy has since&#13;
been eased (Heper 1982). In Yugoslavia, the government is encouraging older&#13;
federal officials to retire early, and Egypt is trying to limit the growth of&#13;
staff at lower levels.&#13;
One of the most drastic efforts to deal with the issue of&#13;
overstaffing was launched in Papua New Guinea in 1982. The Public Service&#13;
Commission divided all government posts into two categories: those deemed&#13;
essential for the mainltenance of government business and others deemed&#13;
noonessential.  Cuts were made affecting 3,620 national and 320 expatriate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
staff--approximately half the target of reducing the size of the public&#13;
serivce by 30 percent. Further cuts are planned in 1983 and beyond.&#13;
Nonessential permanent staff are to receive compensation for the abolition of&#13;
their office, while those on contract will not have their contracts renewed&#13;
(Cochrane 1983).&#13;
Thus, there is an increaLsing awareness in developing and developed&#13;
countries alike that competent specialists are needed on the staff of the&#13;
public service if it is to be managed efficiently. This means, above all,&#13;
that hiring decisions must be based on strict need and merit principles, even&#13;
when overriding social objectives have to be met. The personnel management&#13;
system, then, has to be effective (see Section V below).&#13;
Firing staff from the public service is also difficult. Those who&#13;
suffer from it most are the people laid off (and their families) who join the&#13;
ranks of the unemployed and bid for positions in the private sector. When&#13;
these people are also the least qualified in the public service, their chances&#13;
of finding equivalent employment are low. The result of such layoffs may be&#13;
lower wages for some occupations in the private sector and, in some cases,&#13;
increased disruptive political activity. For these reasons, most governments&#13;
find early retirement schemes (as in Turkey and China) and transfers to&#13;
understaffed geographic regions (as in Bangladesh) more politically feasible.&#13;
Is There Too Much "Fat" in Administration?&#13;
One aspect of this is th,e issue of fast growth of and overstaffing in&#13;
the public service, which is discussed above. Another important question to&#13;
ask is whether there are too many "administrators" working in the&#13;
government. This question parallels Peter Drucker's hypothesis that the ratio&#13;
of persons engaged in service activities to those involved with operations has&#13;
been increasing worldwide. The implication here is that employment in&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
service" departments such as administration, personnel, planning, and finance&#13;
has been increasing at as more rapid pace than employment in production units.&#13;
Data collected by Heller and Tait shed some light on this issue (see&#13;
Tables 4 and 5). There is little difference between developed and developing&#13;
country central governments in terms of per capita number of administrators&#13;
(2.9 administrators per 1,000 population as against 2.3, respectively). If&#13;
one assumes that 90 percent of the public servants classified in the&#13;

categories "administration," "finance and planning," and "labor and social&#13;
security" and 10 percent of those in other categories are engaged in service&#13;
activities and the rest in production or operations, the ratio of service to&#13;
operational personnel is 21 percent in developed and 24 percent in developing&#13;
countries. The same assumption applied to the data in Table 5 yields&#13;
essentially the same ratios. Thus, on the average, developing countries do&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
not appear to be more administration-intensive than the developed countries&#13;
The slight difference (3 percent) is largely attributable to the fact that,&#13;
on a per capita basis, there are more teachers, soldiers, police, and health&#13;
personnel in developed countries (43.7 persons per 1,000 population) than in&#13;
the developing countries (21.5 persons per 1,000 population); and a great&#13;
majority of these are o,perational as opposed to service staff.&#13;
There are significant variations across regions and countries,&#13;
however. The number of public education and health personnel, on a per capita&#13;
basis, is lowest in Africa and highest in Latin America, with the Asian&#13;
countries in between, as can be expected from the level of development in&#13;
these countries. In terms of administrative staff alone, the situation is&#13;
reversed: administrative personnel constitute a much larger percentage of the&#13;
central government staff (adjusted by adding the education, health and police&#13;
personnel working at the state and local government levels) in African&#13;
countries than in Asia and Latin America. This situation could be either a&#13;
reflection of larger "fat" in administration in African countries, or an&#13;
illustration of the phenomenon that a critical minimum size of staff is needed&#13;
in government even at the earliest stages of development when the volume of&#13;
services provided by government is quite small.&#13;
To conclude, the evidence reviewed above does not provide clear-cut&#13;
support for any of the three common views about the public service in&#13;
developing countries. Public service employment is not relatively bigger in&#13;
developing countries compared with the industrialized countries if one takes&#13;
into account population and income factors. Although public service&#13;
employment has been growing about four times faster in developing countries&#13;
than in industrial countries in recent years, it cannot be stated&#13;
categorically that the growth of public service employment in developing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
countries is unproductive. Finally, there does not seem too be too much "fat"&#13;
in administration in developing; countries when the composition of public&#13;
service employment in developed countries is used as a yardstick.&#13;
These tentative findings do not suggest, however, that public&#13;
services in developing countries work efficiently. Shedding light on the&#13;
efficiency question requires, among other endeavors, examination of the&#13;
quality of the staff that make up the public service, especially those in&#13;
critical decisionmaking or advisory posts. This topic is taken up in the next&#13;
section.&#13;
III. Skill Shortages in the Public Service&#13;
The public service cannot be efficiently managed without a staff of&#13;
competent people. This means that the skills that are needed by the public&#13;
service must be available within the country and that the public service&#13;
incentive systems must be capable of attracting and retaining the needed&#13;
staff. These are primarily questions of supply and allocation, respectively.&#13;
Regarding the availability of skilled staff, although commendable&#13;
progress has been made in expanding educational opportunities, several&#13;
developing countries, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, still face&#13;
critical shortages of high- and middle-level professional and technical&#13;
manpower. Nonetheless, the situtation, although still critical, is better&#13;
than at the time of their independence. According to manpower surveys&#13;
conducted in nine sub-Saharan countries during the 1960s, expatriate&#13;
employment as a percentage of employment of trained manpower ranged from a low&#13;
of 13 percent for Nigeria in 19154 to a high of 62 percent in Zambia in 1965,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
with a median of 35 percent. During this period, more than three-quarters of the&#13;
cadres for university graduates were held by expatriates (World Bank 1981).&#13;
The case of Nigeria is particularly revealing. In 1960, the year of&#13;
independence, there was only one university in Nigeria (at Ibadan), and it had&#13;
produced a few more than 600 graduates since its opening in 1948. During the&#13;
initial years after inadependence, the Nigerian university graduates at home&#13;
and abroad totaled less than 1,000 for each year, and, as a result, a great&#13;
majority of the high 'Level positions in the public and the private sector were&#13;
held by expatriates. The situation has improved markedly since independence&#13;
owing to investments in higher education and the implemenation of a policy of&#13;
indigenization. Now, more Nigerians graduate from Nigerian universities every&#13;
year than the number that graduated from the universities in and outside&#13;
Nigeria during all the years of British colonial rule. The dependence on&#13;
expatriates, however, is still considerable in certain occupations. According&#13;
to a 1977 manpower survey, one out of four lecturers in the universities was a&#13;
non-Nigerian, about a fifth of managers and managing directors were&#13;
expatriates, and in many technical and medical professions non-Nigerians&#13;
occupied one-fourth or more of the positions. Vacancy rates, which are also&#13;
indicative of skill shortages, were also high: 22 percent for all modern&#13;
sector occupations, 423 percent for scientific and professional manpower, and&#13;
42 percent for secondary school teachers (Ozgediz 1980).&#13;
Kenya has had a similar experience. In 1967, 63 percent of&#13;
administrators and managers and 61 percent of professionals were&#13;
expatriates. Eight y,ears later both ratios fell to 39 percent. At the&#13;
technician and semipriofessional level, the ratio fell from 31 to 12 percent&#13;
during the same period (Bennell 1981). There have been further decline since&#13;
then. In 1980 only 1.3 percent of modern sector employees consisted of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
noncitizens, compared with 8.3 percent in 1967 (Central Bureau of Statistics&#13;
1981). This drop in the number of expatriates, however, does not imply that&#13;
the role of expatriates has diminished. Many observers of the Kenyan&#13;
situation report that expatriates continue to play an important role,&#13;
particularly in the making of critical decisions in the public service.&#13;
Outside of Africa, skill shortages are still acute in most low-income&#13;
countries (for example, in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burma, Haiti, Laos, Nepal)&#13;
and in resource-rich middle and higher income countries where rapid economic&#13;
growth has outdistanced the expansion of education and training (for example,&#13;
Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia).  More than half the technical assistance&#13;
directed to developing countries is used to finance expatriate personnel,&#13;
while much of the rest goes for the overseas training of developing country&#13;
nationals.&#13;
In countries experiencing acute shortages of high-level technical and&#13;
managerial skills, governments are finding it increasingly difficut to attract&#13;
and retain the professionals they need in the public service. Although there&#13;
are no reliable estimates of the nature of the shortages faced by the public&#13;
service, an internal World Bank survey conducted for the World Development&#13;
Report 1983 shows that about two-thirds of the countries borrowing from the&#13;
Bank are having serious difficulty filling managerial and technical posts in&#13;
the public sector, particularly for engineers and technicians, managers and&#13;
administrators, accountants, economists and doctors. In an even larger number&#13;
of countries governments are having trouble retaining the more experienced&#13;
managers and technicians in the public service. In about half the countries,&#13;
most of the outflow from government is directed toward employment abroad; in&#13;
the other half it is mostly toward the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Within the public service, shortages are most severe in local&#13;
government. In Nigeria, a third of the 143,000 primary school teachers&#13;
possessed no qualifications beyond a primary school learning certificate, and&#13;
a great majority of these worked in rural areas (Ozgediz 1980). This bias&#13;
extends to technical assistance personnel. In Papua New Guinea, meanwhile, of&#13;
the more than 2,000 expatriates working for the government in 1982, only about&#13;
a fifth worked at the local government level (Cochrane 1983). Understandably,&#13;
rural institutions everywhere find it hard to lure staff away from the&#13;
attractions of urban life.&#13;
Skill shortages in the public service are as much qualitative as&#13;
quantitative. This is in part a result of the uneven quality of secondary and&#13;
higher education in most developing countries. The most widely observed&#13;
problems are the weakness of school systems in training people for science and&#13;
mathematics-based occupations and the dominance of secondary and higher&#13;
education systems by foreign-based curricula, which lock countries into&#13;
occupational arrays not well suited to their particular needs. Second, the&#13;
weakness of the publLc service training systems influences the quality of&#13;
public service staff . Third, the strong demand from the private sector for&#13;
the more able graduates, coupled with the fact that public sector salaries in&#13;
most developing countries are not high enough to attract or retain well-&#13;
qualified people in government, has exacerbated the qualitative dimension of&#13;
the skill shortage problem. (These last two issues are discussed in greater&#13;
detail in sections IV and V.)&#13;
The long-run solution to countrywide skill shortage problems lies in&#13;
increasing the supply of people with the needed skills. As the array of&#13;
skills required changes over time in response to changes in the structure of&#13;
production and technology, such increases in supply require forward-looking&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
efforts in education and manpower planning. There is also scope for&#13;
increasing the supply of skills, without further new investments, through&#13;
improvements in the internal and external efficiency of educational systems&#13;
(World Bank 1980).&#13;
The experiences to date with manpower planning have not yielded good&#13;
results, mainly because of methodological problems. The most widely used&#13;
method, the manpower requirements approach, applies a set of manpower&#13;
utilization coefficients to sectoral projections of GDP to estimate the&#13;
requirements for specific categories of skilled manpower. This approach&#13;
suffers from the limitations inherent in all types of long-range planning:&#13;
the inability to capture in models all the complex relationships,&#13;
uncertainties surrounding future changes in the external environment, and poor&#13;
data. That the projections are often wrong is as much attributable to&#13;
unrealistic assumptions about economic growth and trends in labor&#13;
productivity, as it is to underlying inadequacies of the data and errors in&#13;
the estimates of the manpower utilization coefficients. Also, substitution&#13;
between different types of skilled manpower is often overlooked.&#13;
A complementary method, the rate of return approach, compares the&#13;
costs of providing a given type of schooling with the incremental benefits&#13;
measured in terms of projected earnings. It provides a rationale for ranking&#13;
different educational investments, but provides little help in matching&#13;
specific future skill requirements with the expected supply of graduates.&#13;
Also, the approach suffers from uncertainties regarding future relative&#13;
earnings that are used for measuring social benefits. (Psacharopoulos 1982;&#13;
Hollister 1981; ILO 1978).&#13;
Given various limitations, no single manpower planning method can be&#13;
relied on to guide the planning of investments in education and training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Both approaches described above, or their variants, should be used&#13;
simultaneously and the resulting sets of projections should be regarded merely&#13;
as pieces of diagnostic information policymakers can use. In addition,&#13;
selective analysis of labor markets is needed. The objective here should be&#13;
to secure timely and operationally useful information on skilled manpower&#13;
surpluses, shortages, flows, wage movements, and the costs of alternative&#13;
programs. New techniques for collecting such information are being tested in&#13;
several countries with ILO assistance. Systematically tapping the knowledge&#13;
of key employers on manpower and employment patterns in several localities has&#13;
yielded useful information in countries including Bangladesh, India, Malaysia,&#13;
and Sri Lanka (ILO 1981; ILO 1982). Tracer studies and job vacancy surveys&#13;
for critical skills have also been useful.&#13;
Manpower needs can be assessed with greater certainty at the&#13;
enterprise level in both the public and the private sector than for the&#13;
economy as a whole---in the light of production plans, likely changes in&#13;
technology, firsthand data on labor productivity, and the potential for&#13;
substitutability--and recruitment and staff development strategies can be&#13;
formulated with greater confidence. These exercises should also take into&#13;
account emigration of skilled manpower.&#13;
The Brain Drain&#13;
Given the shortages of high level professional and technical manpower&#13;
in many developing countries, the emigration of these people in significant&#13;
numbers can have adverse consequences for development. The brain drain can&#13;
have harmful effects even in the few instances where there appears to be a&#13;
relative abundance of skilled people (such as doctors and engineers in the&#13;
urban areas of India), since it reduces the "spillover" from the urban areas&#13;
where most are seeking work to underserved rural areas (Bhagwati 1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Although a few countries have sizaLble benefits from exports of human capital,&#13;
particularly when the remittances substantially offset the investment costs of&#13;
creating such manpower, most developing countries experiencing emigration are&#13;
faced with the difficult task of finding replacements in the short term.&#13;
The overall magnitude of brain drain (or "reverse flows of&#13;
technology" as UNCTAD calls the phenomenon) is substantial. But, because of&#13;
severe problems with the data and methodology, no precise or comprehensive&#13;
estimate is available. Most studies focus on a single country of destination&#13;
and examine the gains of the recipilent country against the losses suffered by&#13;
the countries of origin.&#13;
A recent UNCTAD Secretariat study (1982) examined the key findings&#13;
from three studies focusing on emigration of high-level manpower to the United&#13;
States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The first of these, a U.S. government&#13;
study, concluded that the estimated savings in U.S. dollars by the United&#13;
States as a result of brain drain are considerably greater than the loss&#13;
suffered by the developing countries: savings of $882.8 million as against a&#13;
loss of $320.2 million in 1972. According to the second study, replacement&#13;
costs of human capital transferred to Canada during 1967-73 range from&#13;
$Can. 1.0 billion to $Cand 2.4 billion at 1968 prices, which is roughly ten&#13;
times greater than the value of Canada's spending on aid for education and&#13;
technical assistance during the same period. The third study, conducted by&#13;
UNCTAD in 1975, places the income gains of the United States, Canada, and the&#13;
United Kingdom from brain drain, net of income foregone by the developing&#13;
countries, at $44 billion for the 1961-72 period, which is slightly under the&#13;
$46 billion total overseas development assistance (ODA) figure for these three&#13;
countries during the same period. This study reports the imported capital&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
value of skilled migration (as a percent of ODA) to be 272 percent for Canada,&#13;
56 percent for the United Kingdom, and 50 percent for the United States.&#13;
The issue of remittances changes the complexion of the brain drain&#13;
phenomenon. It underscores the benefits to both the migrants themselves (in&#13;
the form of much increased incomes) and their countries (in the form of&#13;
increased foreign exchange earnings). A recent World Bank study of thirty-two&#13;
labor-exporting developing countries shows that these countries recorded&#13;
receipts of about $23 billion in remittances in 1978, which is equivalent to&#13;
about 10 percent of the value of their exports of goods and services (Swamy&#13;
1981). Within thiB total, the share contributed by professional and technical&#13;
people is not known, although some information is available for a few&#13;
individual countries. Although professional and technical manpower--teachers,&#13;
doctors, engineers--constituted only 4 percent of Pakistani emigrants to the&#13;
Middle East in 1979, they earned about 17 percent of total emigrant income and&#13;
their per capita remittances averaged $4,500 a year--more than twice that of&#13;
unskilled workers. The remittance figures are even higher for high-level&#13;
emigrants from Bangladesh: in 1979 the 1,200 such emigrants working in the&#13;
Middle East sent home about 60 percent of their overseas salaries--an average&#13;
of about $9,800 per person at 1979 prices (Ali et al. 1981).&#13;
These studies imply that the receiving countries gain from the export&#13;
of high-level manpower from the developing countries, as do the migrants&#13;
themselves and the countries where such manpower is in surplus.  But when&#13;
emigration takes place from countries that are already facing acute high-level&#13;
manpower shortages, the losses can be serious for institutions in both the&#13;
public and the private sector. Small countries often tend to be the hardest&#13;
hit as they have no margin to compensate for the skills lost, but the impact&#13;
can be serious even for relatively large countries. A recent study of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Philippines estimates that, with present enrollment rates and no emigration,&#13;
it will take the educational systemi there about sixteen years to produce the&#13;
physicians the country needs. But if the present emigration rate among&#13;
physicians continues, it will take twenty-six years to produce the number&#13;
needed (Abella 1979). A World Bank study of emigration to the oil-producing&#13;
countries of the Middle East reached similar conclusions. In 1975 emigration&#13;
of professional and technical workers from Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman,&#13;
Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, and the two Yemens constituted 13 percent of their&#13;
total available manpower at this level; by contrast, emigrating unskilled&#13;
workers amounted to less than 4 percent of the total stock of such manpower in&#13;
the exporting countries. The debilitating effects of brain drain on a single&#13;
country is best illustrated by the case of Sudan. If present emigration&#13;
trends continue to 1985, over two-thirds of Sudanese professional and&#13;
technical workers are likely to be employed in other countries in the Middle&#13;
East, as compared with less than one percent of unskilled Sudanese workers&#13;
(Serageldin et al. 1983).&#13;
There is also some information about the effects of brain drain on&#13;
the productivity of individual sectors in developing countries. A 1983 World&#13;
Bank report on Turkey's energy sector notes, for example, that the capacity of&#13;
public institutions to implement the domestic energy program has been severely&#13;
curtailed as a result of the emigration of experienced professionals to other&#13;
countries or to the private sector. The Turkish Electricity Authority's net&#13;
loss of engineers with six or more years the experience, for example, jumped&#13;
from 6 in 1977 to 54 in 1980; the niumber of engineers in the State Hydraulic&#13;
Works Dam Design and Construction Department similarly declined from more than&#13;
100 to 55 in recent years; and the most qualified senior exploration and&#13;
drilling staff of the Turkish Petroleum Company left at an alarming rate in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
1980 and 1981 (World Bank 1983). Similar trends have been observed in&#13;
Guyana's bauxite and electricity utility institutions and Egypt's national&#13;
urban planning office.&#13;
The causes of and remedies for brain drain vary from country to&#13;
country. If the underlying cause is political (as it was after the change of&#13;
regime in Jamaica in 1975), a change in the po'litical climate may encourage&#13;
migrants to return. If brain drain is caused mainly by the pull of economic&#13;
incentives, however, reversing the trend is costly and should only be&#13;
attempted on a selective basis. The government of Sri Lanka, for example,&#13;
launched a program in 1979 to encourage professionals to stay, or return home,&#13;
by revising its pension system, easing exchange controls so that people could&#13;
finance the education of their children abroad, and by facilitating re-entry&#13;
of senior staff to appropriate positions in government (Tilakaratna 1982).&#13;
Guaranteeing jobs for those who might return and recruiting abroad for&#13;
important public service positions have also been effective measures. In the&#13;
1970s, with a similar approach, the Republic of Korea was successful in luring&#13;
back Korean scientists trained abroad.&#13;
Other steps can also be taken to slow the brain drain. Paying&#13;
adequate salaries to retain the needed staff is an obvous one. A survey of&#13;
developing country students in Canada, France, and the United States showed&#13;
that they were much more likely to return home if they signed a pledge or&#13;
deposited a money bond before their departure (Glazer 1978). Imposing heavy&#13;
emigration taxes and passport fees on trained manpower may discourage them&#13;
from leaving, but such action may compromise basic human rights. Another&#13;
similar measure is to introduce a program of compulsory public service&#13;
employment for certain categories of personnel, akin to military service, as&#13;
is being tried for medical doctors in Turkey. Finally, developed countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
can aid these efforts by enforcing visa rules for certain categories of&#13;
temporary immigrants (for example, "exchange visitors" to the United States)&#13;
that require them to leave upon ccmpletion of their study or research mission.&#13;
Internal Flows of Qualified Manpower&#13;
Problems due to emigration of trained manpower from the public&#13;
service are compounded in some coumtries by the brain drain from the public to&#13;
the private sector. This trend isl not as pronounced in countries with a&#13;
relatively weak and slow growing private sector (for example, Ghana) or in&#13;
some Asian countries where lifetime employment in an enterprise is the norm&#13;
and, consequently, labor mobility is low. It is also not too serious in&#13;
countries where the discrepancy between public and private sector salaries is&#13;
not wide (for example, several Latin American countries, Malaysia,&#13;
Singapore). It has become a major factor, however, in countries where trained&#13;
manpower is scarce and there is a fast growing private sector (for example,&#13;
Kenya and Nigeria) or where public sector compensation levels for senior staff&#13;
lag far behind the rates in the private sector (for example, Turkey and&#13;
Jordan).&#13;
In several countries in the Middle East, the public sector has become&#13;
the private sector's principal training ground for university graduates. In&#13;
some (for example, Egypt), a guaraLnteed graduate employment scheme attracts&#13;
into government service young professionals who cannot find jobs elsewhere.&#13;
In others, the high priority private sector institutions place on prior work&#13;
experience--in part because of the! absence or weakness of career development&#13;
and training programs for young professionals joining private establishments--&#13;
leaves most applicants with little choice except to apply for a government&#13;
job. According to a survey of pubilic servants in Turkey, more than 40 percent&#13;
of those who joined the service recently indicated that they did so because&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
they could not find a job elsewhere. Most were dissatisfied with their work,&#13;
as 32 percent had made up their minds to quit and another 50 percent were&#13;
searching for jobs elsewhere (Heper 1982). As a consequence, in recent years&#13;
there has been a sizab:le exodus of experienced and qualified staff to the&#13;
private sector from Turkey's public service. A similar trend is evident in&#13;
other countries in the Middle East, notably Jordan.&#13;
In many respects regular interchange of qualified staff between the&#13;
public and the private sector is healthy for both sectors. This broadens the&#13;
staff's understanding of each other's problems and helps to construct a&#13;
fruitful dialogue between public servants and private sector establishments.&#13;
When these flows are only in one direction, however, little benefit accrues to&#13;
the institutions losing such manpower.&#13;
There are several remedies for slowing the flow of qualified manpower&#13;
from the public to the private sector. The most obvious is to reduce wide&#13;
disparities between public and private sector salaries. Allowing lateral&#13;
entry into public serv:Lce positions is another measure. A third is to improve&#13;
the career prospects of public servants through better training and personnel&#13;
management system. These issues are taken up below, starting with the last.&#13;
IV. Public Service Training&#13;
Training is perhaps the most popularly prescribed remedy for curing&#13;
organizational ills. As payoffs from changes in educational systems&#13;
materialize only in the long run, training is often seen as the short-term&#13;
solution to equipping the staff with the desired skills and knowledge. At&#13;
times of structural change in society or after an administrative reform,&#13;
training is often seen as the only practical way of equipping public servants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
with the tools they need to play new roles. Political leaders also regard&#13;
training as a socialization or indoctrination device for generating an esprit&#13;
de corps or instilling in staff the values and attitudes consistent with a&#13;
particular political ideology. And many staff see training as an opportunity&#13;
for career advancement.&#13;
Despite the multiplicity of the objectives it serves, training is&#13;
largely a mystery: its effectiveness is rarely measurable in precise terms&#13;
and its methodology is a constant source of debate among educators. But&#13;
recent experiments in developed and developing countries and advances in&#13;
learning theory have pointed to a number of promising avenues that can&#13;
increase the overall effectiveness of training. Following a brief overview of&#13;
the expansion of training in developing countries, this section identifies the&#13;
most common problems faced in public service training and points to areas&#13;
requiring rethinking and policy reform.&#13;
Expansion of Public Service Training in Developing Countries&#13;
The original impetus for initiating and expanding public service&#13;
training systems in developing countries came from international organizations&#13;
and large donor agencies. As early as 1948, the United Nations recognized&#13;
that public administration had to be improved in developing countries and that&#13;
provision of technical assistance for training in public administration was a&#13;
logical first step in this direction (Olivero 1982). Other agencies, notably&#13;
the Ford Foundation and the USAID, also supported this thinking. As a result,&#13;
the 1950s and early 1960s witnessed two major trends: increased donor&#13;
assistance in the establishment of public service training institutes in&#13;
developing countries, and the expansion of overseas training opportunities for&#13;
developing country nationals. Thus, the United Nations, USAID, and the Ford&#13;
Foundation are estimated to have spent about $250 million in support of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
institution building in public administration alone during 1951-62 (Paul&#13;
1983). The United NatiLons provided direct or indirect assistance in the&#13;
establishment of thirty-nine institutes of public administration in response&#13;
to demands for assistance from countries such as Turkey, the United Arab&#13;
Republic, Libya, Ethiopia, El Salvador, Brazil, Costa Rica, Ghana, and&#13;
Argentina (Olivero 1982). The U.S. government helped set up new training&#13;
institutions in several Latin American countries and in Korea, Vietnam,&#13;
Thailand, the Philippines, and Pakistan. The French government focused on&#13;
institution building in Francophone African countries and the Ford Foundation&#13;
helped establish institutes in India, Pakistan, Egypt, and Indonesia (Paul&#13;
1983).&#13;
After the initial set-up years, the developing countries themselves&#13;
further expanded training infrastructure and diversified their institutions&#13;
and training curricula. The expansion has been quite rapid: according to a&#13;
survey by the International Association of Schools and Institutes of&#13;
Administration, there were 276 government institutions, university&#13;
departments, and independent institutes providing public administration and&#13;
management training in 31 developing countries in 1980, which is four times&#13;
the number listed in a United Nations report in 1960 (Paul 1983).&#13;
Diversification has ta]ken various forms. First, five regional and&#13;
intergovernmental training institutions--three under U.N. auspices--were&#13;
established in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to support public service&#13;
training institutions in individual countries and to help form a network of&#13;
training institutions. Second, in keeping with the changes in development&#13;
thinking, new areas of training gained prominence in the 1970s. The World&#13;
Bank's spending on project-related training, for example, increased from $38&#13;
million in 1976 to $187 million in 1981. The target groups of U.N.-supported&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
training programs also shifted f.rom supervisory management in the initial&#13;
years to middle management in the 1960s and finally top management in the late&#13;
1970s (Olivero 1983). Third, the training curricula underwent considerable&#13;
changes over the years, partly in response to changes in target groups, but&#13;
mostly because of advances in academic disciplines related to public&#13;
management.  In the 1950s, the initial training programs concentrated&#13;
exclusively on traditional public administration subjects; public personnel&#13;
management, organization and methods (O&amp;M) services, government accounting and&#13;
auditing, principles of organization, and so on. Although these subjects&#13;
still make up a good portion of current training programs, newer ones--such as&#13;
policy analysis, organization development, industrial relations, attitudinal&#13;
and behavioral change, and information systems--are being included. In&#13;
addition, there is greater emphasis on management training for specific&#13;
programs and institutions (for example, rural development, health care, state-&#13;
owned enterprises, fami'ly planning, educational institutions, and so on)&#13;
(Olivero 1982).&#13;
As a result of the investments by donors and developing country&#13;
governments in training infrastructure, there has been a considerable increase&#13;
in the number of public servants trained. According to Paul (1983), the&#13;
increase was ninefold over a twenty-year period in Malaysia, fivefold in India&#13;
(central government only), and equally rapid in most other developing&#13;
countries. Donor agencies continue to support investments in training.&#13;
Training schemes financed by the U.N. Development Program in 1981 amounted to&#13;
more than $70 million, including the award of 11,500 overseas fellowships to&#13;
developing country nationals. The industrial market economies are currently&#13;
granting $500-600 million a year (including the award of roughly 110,000&#13;
overseas fellowships) for the triaining of developing country nationals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Problem Areas&#13;
Given the skill shortages faced by the public service in most&#13;
developing countries and the role training can play in overcoming them, one&#13;
would expect developing countries to put more emphasis on public service&#13;
training than the developed countries. Available evidence indicates, however,&#13;
that, despite the impressive growth record since 1950, training still receives&#13;
less emphasis in developing countries than in public sector organizations in&#13;
industrialized countries, or private enterprises, or multinational&#13;
corporations. The United States and Japanese governments, for instance, offer&#13;
training opportunities to nearly a quarter of their employees every year (Paul&#13;
1983). Management trai'ning programs in developing countries are attended more&#13;
frequently by staff from private sector organizations, as shown by a recent&#13;
review of successful programs in twenty developing countries (Roberts 1982).&#13;
Among the multinationals, all IBM managers get at least forty hours of&#13;
mandatory training a year, in which the major emphasis is on issues of "people&#13;
management" (Roberts 1982), and Siemens and Unilever annually spend the&#13;
equivalent of 5 percent of their payrolls on training (Paul 1983).&#13;
In contrast vith their counterparts in industrialized countries, only&#13;
a small share of developing country public servants are exposed to training.&#13;
In Malaysia, which puts greater emphasis on training than do most developing&#13;
countries, only 4 percent of federal and state workers received some form of&#13;
training in 1978. In India, only one senior civil servant in five is likely&#13;
to have some in-service training during his entire career (Paul 1983); in&#13;
Turkey only one in seven has received any instruction in public administration&#13;
(Heper 1982). Local government officials typically fare even worse. Although&#13;
they account for a small share (about 20 percent) of all government employees&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
in developing countries, an even smaller share of the total government budget&#13;
for training is allocated to them (Cochrane 1983).&#13;
These low levels of training in developing countries can be partly&#13;
explained by the fact that public service organizations in these countries&#13;
spend much less on training than do similar organizations in industrialized&#13;
countries or the multinationals., Training expenditures of the Indian central&#13;
government as a share of its total payroll were 0.5 percent in 1968--roughly&#13;
one-tenth of the equivalent share in some large multinationals. Public&#13;
service training expenditures of the government of Malaysia were much higher&#13;
at 2.75 percent, but that is still considerably less than the comparator&#13;
figures for the multinationals. Training expenditures in most developing&#13;
countries are probably between these two extremes.&#13;
A second reason for the! relatively low number of persons going&#13;
through public service training in developing countries is that much of what&#13;
is spent on training goes to more expensive training programs of long duration&#13;
(one to two years). In his review of public service training programs in&#13;
developing countries, Paul (1983) finds that such training is heavily&#13;
concentrated on pre-entry and immediate post-entry courses for administrative&#13;
elites, to the neglect of in-service training and the training needs of lower&#13;
level staff.&#13;
The reason for this bias in most low income developing countries is&#13;
that higher education institutions inadequately prepare some of their&#13;
graduates for careers in the public service. In others, social and political&#13;
goals, such as indigenization of the public service and creation of an esprit&#13;
de corps in the higher echelons of the public service, require longer term&#13;
entry-level training programs. Although legitimate, these reasons do not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
imply, however, that the training needs of other public servants should be&#13;
completely overlooked.&#13;
The problems connected with the quantitative dimension of public&#13;
service training--that is, the overall shortage of training opportunities and&#13;
their skewed distributiLon in favor of administrative elites--are exacerbated&#13;
by the poor quality of training in most developing countries. Several types&#13;
of qualitative problems have been observed (Paul 1983; Olivero 1982; Roberts&#13;
1982; Kubr and Wallace 1983):&#13;
o    Training is often treated as a discrete event, rather&#13;
than a part of an overall program of organizational&#13;
improvement.&#13;
o    Few trainees are selected on the basis of greatest need;&#13;
bureaucratic politics and patronage play a more important&#13;
role.&#13;
o    Competent trainers are rare, as training is not a&#13;
profession in high demand and trainers have few&#13;
opportunities to upgrade their skills and obtain&#13;
firsthand knowledge of the environments from which&#13;
trainees come.&#13;
o    Training curricula and materials are usually based on&#13;
borrowed models that are rarely updated; little effort is&#13;
made to generate indigenous materials.&#13;
O    Classroom-based, academic-style teaching still dominates&#13;
most training programs; building training on the&#13;
knowledge trainees already possess and relating it to&#13;
actual work environments are rare practices.&#13;
O    Evaluations of training go little beyond taking&#13;
attendance and assessing the "happiness levels" of&#13;
trainees; effects of training on knowledge, attitudes,&#13;
behaviors, and job performance are rarely measured.&#13;
O    Most training institutions are poorly financed and&#13;
managed, except for a few "centers of excellence" found&#13;
in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.&#13;
These observations portray a dismal picture of the status of public&#13;
service training in developing countries. Although there are no clear-cut&#13;
remedies that are appliLcable to all countries, the experiences of some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
successful training institutions--such as the Indian Institute of Management,&#13;
Ahmedabad (IIMA), the Asian Institute of Management in the Philippines (AIM),&#13;
Malaysia's National Institute of Public Administration (INTAN), and the&#13;
Central American Institute of Business Administration (INCAE) in Nicaragua--&#13;
illustrate the policy interventions that are likely to be necessary for&#13;
correcting the quantitative and qualitative deficiencies of most public&#13;
service training systems.&#13;
Courses of Action&#13;
A flexible and dynamic public service requires a responsive and&#13;
forward-looking training system. As the demands placed upon the public&#13;
service change, so do its composition and the functions it performs.&#13;
Similarly, as the staff move from job to job, retire, or leave the public&#13;
service, suitable replacements must be found to take their place. An&#13;
effective public service training system must anticipate and respond to these&#13;
changes in a timely manner.&#13;
Building such a training system requires action in five interrelated&#13;
areas:&#13;
o    the status of the training function in government&#13;
o    preparation of training policies and plans&#13;
o    links between public service training and other areas of&#13;
public personnel manageiment&#13;
o    links between training, research, and consultancy&#13;
o    international cooperation on training.&#13;
The status of training. In most countries, training suffers from low&#13;
visibility and priority in government. This is partly because it is usually&#13;
regarded as an element of personnel management, which itself has low status in&#13;
government (see the section on personnel management below). Training is often&#13;
seen as a luxury and an activity that has little or no effect. Public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
servants seldom demand training, unless they want to have a break from their&#13;
daily routines, as the outcomes they expect from it are not of high value to&#13;
them. In some countries, for example, Pakistan, senior civil servants invited&#13;
to attend training programs often send their subordinates as their&#13;
replacement. In short, the situation in most developing countries is a&#13;
vicious circle of poor performance, poor status, and poor demand.&#13;
By contrast, training in many large multinationals and private&#13;
organizations is accorded high status and receives high priority. For&#13;
example, in Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics company,&#13;
training is one of four important centralized functions (the others are&#13;
accounting, capital budgeting, and performance reviews and personnel&#13;
management). In-service training is a way of life for all employees,&#13;
particularly supervisors and managers, and training is well integrated with&#13;
other aspects of management (Kubr and Wallace 1983). The Is Bank in Turkey&#13;
has also taken a pro--active stance toward training. Frequent performance&#13;
assessments lead to the identification of problem areas for which training&#13;
programs are quickly designed and implemented. In these and other&#13;
organizations, human resources are seen as the most valuable asset of the&#13;
enterprise, a view that facilitates justiffcation of further investments in&#13;
this resource.&#13;
The status of training can be raised in several ways. The methods&#13;
employed by INTAN of Malaysia illustrate some of these options:&#13;
o    It is located in the powerful central personnel agency.&#13;
O    It has operational and budgetary autonomy.&#13;
O    It is headed by a senior civil servant whose personal&#13;
prestige underscores the seriousness with which the&#13;
government views its work.&#13;
O    A council of senior representatives from government&#13;
ministries provides continuous feedback and advice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
o    It offers competitive salaries to its instructors and&#13;
provides them with opportunities for further advancement.&#13;
o    It takes training evaluation seriously and modifies&#13;
programs on the basis of evaluation results and feedback&#13;
from the participants.&#13;
Training will attain greater status when it is made an element of&#13;
major policy initiatives by the government. In Malaysia, for example, training&#13;
is an integral component of the government's New Economic Policy, which lays&#13;
stress on improving public sector employment and promotion opportunities for&#13;
ethnic Malays. In other countries, this can be achieved by tying training&#13;
closely to changes in economic policy (for example, an export promotion&#13;
drive), social develoment strategy (for example, development of a particular&#13;
geographic region), or the structure of government (for example,&#13;
administrative decentralization).&#13;
According higher status and authority to training may not lead to&#13;
better performance, however, unless measures are included to ensure greater&#13;
accountability of the training systtem. For this reason, training evaluation&#13;
must be given higher priority and the training system must be made more "user-&#13;
driven"--that is, it must be responisive to the most urgent needs of its&#13;
clients. A strong planning and policymaking framework for training is an&#13;
important element of such a system.&#13;
Training policies and plans. Recent reviews of training in&#13;
developing countries show that most: have no clear policies and plans for&#13;
public service training, although some (such as India, Indonesia, Kenya,&#13;
Malaysia, the Philippines, and Zimbabwe) have made notable attempts to fill&#13;
this vacuum (Paul 1983; U.N. 1978, 1982). Indonesia, for example, is&#13;
currently developing a comprehensive nationwide management training plan,&#13;
which covers both the public and the private sector, with assistance from the&#13;
World Bank, ILO, UNDP, USAID, the Ford Foundation, and other donor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
organizations. The Commonwealth Secretariat is collaborating with the&#13;
Economic Commission for Africa to establish public service training plans in&#13;
several African countries. In many developing countries, however, training&#13;
needs are determined on an impressionistic basis. The task is often left to&#13;
the training staff, who tend to offer programs and courses they can teach,&#13;
rather than those the clients need. The emphasis is thus on teaching instead&#13;
of learning.&#13;
Public service training plans should specify the objectives, types,&#13;
and duration of training for different categories of personnel and the&#13;
institutions that should carry out the training. These specifications should&#13;
be based on systematic and periodic assessments of present and expected future&#13;
training needs and on the evaluation results of past training programs. The&#13;
regular asessments of training needs should be supplemented with evaluations&#13;
of the capacity of the public service to implement new policies at times of&#13;
major new policy initiatives by the government.&#13;
The experience of the World Bank's Economic Development Institute&#13;
(EDI) shows the importance of carefully assessing needs in designing a medium-&#13;
term training plan. In Niger, for example, EDI staff worked closely with the&#13;
representatives of the Ministry of Rural Development and the personnel of five&#13;
agricultural projects to identify ways of improving the management of the&#13;
projects. The assessments conducted by the Nigeriens themselves led them to&#13;
identify training needs in specific areas and to prepare a three-year plan for&#13;
training for rural development. EDI's involvement in Tunisia and other&#13;
countries produced similar results in that training plans were generated&#13;
through a "trickle-up" process that began with the project staff and moved to&#13;
the upper echelons of the involved ministries, rather than being left--as is&#13;
more common--to an external entity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
After needs assessment and initial design, field testing of a&#13;
training package is the next critical step in tailoring the plans to client&#13;
needs, as noted by John Montgomery (Paul 1983) in the testing of a model&#13;
curriculum in Zambia. This model was developed by the African Center for&#13;
Administrative Training and Research for Development (CAFRAD) for training&#13;
rural project managers in its thirty-two member states. The test showed that&#13;
the curriculum actually dealt with less than 30 percent of the areas in which&#13;
rural project managers felt they needed instruction. As a result, the&#13;
training program was fully redesigned.&#13;
Training plans should also spell out ways of meeting the identified&#13;
needs. Details should be providecd on all possible sources of training:&#13;
overseas training, instruction at the higher education institutes in the&#13;
country, training in the governmentts institutes, and training available&#13;
through collaborative ventures with private enterprises and multinationals.&#13;
The last source, in particular, presents an opportunity to improve dialogue&#13;
with private and multinational ent:erprises and can help economize on the&#13;
government's scarce training resources. In the past, multinationals have&#13;
entered into such arrangements, among others, with the National Manpower and&#13;
Youth Council in the Philippines, National Administrative and Management&#13;
Training Centers in Brazil, the Science Council in Singapore, and government&#13;
training institutes in Malaysia and Nigeria (Roberts 1982).&#13;
The effectiveness of traiining can be enhanced by actively involving&#13;
users of training in the preparation of training plans and policies. An&#13;
advisory group of senior officials from ministries, as in Malaysia, can be&#13;
helpful. In addition, the views of line managers on the training needs of&#13;
their staff should be periodically sought. Also, in organizational settings&#13;
with a reasonably effective performance accountability system in place,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37 -&#13;
training budgets can be allocated to line managers. This approach would&#13;
ensure closer ties between training and on-the-job performance and would help&#13;
actively involve line managers in post-training follow-up.&#13;
Links between training and personnel policies.  Public service&#13;
training is clearly an integral part of the government's personnel management&#13;
function and, as such, policies and plans on training should be closely linked&#13;
with policies governing other aspects of personnel management. Recruitment&#13;
policies, for example, should go hand in hand with plans for entry-level&#13;
training. Similarly, rotations and transfers should be viewed not only as a&#13;
personnel reassignment measure, but also as a staff development vehicle. Most&#13;
important, training should be closely tied with career development,&#13;
performance assessment, and promotion policies.&#13;
All training aims at generating some type of change--in the&#13;
knowledge, skills, values, attitudes, or behavior of the trainees. Such&#13;
changes must be valued by the organization if the trainees are to be motivated&#13;
to undergo training and apply what they have learned upon their return to&#13;
their own job settings.  Also, because most changes of this type require a&#13;
time period longer than the duration of typical training programs to take&#13;
hold, the work environment must reinforce the changes initiated during&#13;
training.&#13;
These observations havre several personnel policy implications.&#13;
First, if the trainee believes that the changes that may result from training&#13;
will not mean much for him in the form of promotion or career advancement, he&#13;
may refrain from enrolling or may attend the course reluctantly.  Malaysia has&#13;
found the solution to this problem by making training an integral part of&#13;
career development. Each trainee's performance is formally assessed at INTAN,&#13;
and in some cases certain courses have to be completed successfully before a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
public servant can be promoted. For some jobs, this pattern is reversed--&#13;
people are selected for the training needed for promotion only if they have&#13;
performed well at their jobs.&#13;
Second, if the line managers do not provide opportunities to the&#13;
trainee to apply his new skills, the benefits from training will be quickly&#13;
lost. Thus, as noted earlier, the line managers should be closely involved in&#13;
the assessment of training needs and training follow-up methods should be&#13;
emphasized in the training programs for line managers.&#13;
Third, as people learn more on the job than in a training&#13;
institution, the workplace should be seen as the primary location for&#13;
learning. Rotational assignments of short duration can sometimes equip the&#13;
public servant with better skills than formal training programs can.&#13;
Similarly, apprenticeship and self-learning programs can have higher payoff&#13;
than courses completed at training institutes. These and other similar&#13;
learning alternatives should be made a part of the career development plan for&#13;
each public servant; and that plan should be implemented jointly by the line&#13;
manager and the personnel officer of the individual concerned.&#13;
Career prospects of trainers should be another consideration in the&#13;
linking of training and personnel policies. In most countries training is a&#13;
"stale" profession and instructors have few opportunities for career&#13;
development. To bring dynamism to the training profession and to raise the&#13;
status of the training function, institutions should give successful trainers&#13;
overseas assignments and consultaacy opportunities. Also, staff of training&#13;
institutions could be assigned to regular civil service jobs (and vice versa),&#13;
which would bring them more closely in touch with operational work and&#13;
stimulate new ideas for training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
Linking training, research, and consultancy. There are several&#13;
advantages to having the staff of the training institutions undertake research&#13;
and consultancy for ministries and parastatal organizations. For one thing,&#13;
trainers will be in c:lose contact with line agencies and be kept aware of&#13;
their operational problems. The additional budgetary costs can be largely&#13;
offset by the fees received. Such a strategy also enables the staff of&#13;
training institutions to develop up-to-date indigenous training materials.&#13;
The most successful training institutions in developing countries have all&#13;
benefited from integration with research and consultancy, as in the case of&#13;
AIM's work with the Philippine Ministry of Agriculture, IIMA's involvement&#13;
with a large population program in Uttar Pradesh, India, and INCAE's role as&#13;
adviser on several rural development projects in Central America.&#13;
In establishing stronger links between training, research, and&#13;
consultancy, policymakers should keep in mind that the main mission of public&#13;
service training institutions is training. Research and consultancy&#13;
activities should be performed only to the extent that they are necessary to&#13;
make training programs more meaningful for public servants and more relevant&#13;
to the world of work. Too much research can easily turn a training&#13;
institution into an academic center, and too much consultancy can change the&#13;
institution to an administrative reform organization or an O&amp;M office.&#13;
Obviously, these other activities are also necessary; the point is that the&#13;
training institution may not be the proper agency to carry them out. That is&#13;
a question each country must decide for itself.&#13;
International cooperation on training. International agencies and&#13;
large aid donors have played an important role not only in the expansion of&#13;
training infrastructure in developing countries, but also in the greater&#13;
exchange of research and information in this area. The activities of regional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
institutes illustrate this role. The Asian and Pacific Development&#13;
Administration Centre (APDAC, which recently merged with three other regional&#13;
institutes under the title of Asian and Pacific Development Centre, APDC)&#13;
played an important catalytic role in stimulating national training&#13;
institutions and in providing several countries with a forum for exchange of&#13;
ideas and experiences. The East and Southern Africa Management Institute&#13;
(ESAMI) had a similar experience iin assisting enterprises and government&#13;
agencies in the area of management. Another regional institution, the Central&#13;
America Public Administration Institute (ICAP), provided direct assistance to&#13;
its member countries in the areas of training and research. From 1954 to 1961&#13;
it provided public service training in public administration to 388 civil&#13;
service officials from Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.&#13;
Later it developed concentrated and country-specific training programs in&#13;
specialized areas such as customs administration, development administration,&#13;
financial management, statistics, and highways and postal management. During&#13;
1964-74, ICAP, in addition to training, provided about 200 technical&#13;
assistance missions; and in 1980 it established a Masters program in public&#13;
administration (Olivero 1982). Other regional centers continue to play an&#13;
important role in improving international dialogue in training.  The regional&#13;
institute concept is particularly relevant to small states, many of which find&#13;
it uneconomic to invest in separate and full-fledged public service training&#13;
institutions.&#13;
International cooperation in training has proved to be effective in&#13;
generating innovations and in testing and documenting them. Some of the&#13;
recent and promising approaches to, training have been the result of such&#13;
collaboration. Four prime examples of this development are:&#13;
o    Action learning, pioneered by the National Coal Board in&#13;
the United Kingdom and then used in many public and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
private organ:Lzations throughout the world. Managers&#13;
work individually or in teams to solve a practical&#13;
problem. They may spend time in a lecture room with a&#13;
tutor or consultant, but there is no "trainer" as such to&#13;
teach "trainees." Experiments with action learning have&#13;
been made with OECD assistance in Egypt, with British&#13;
assistance in India, with the Ford Foundation's support&#13;
in the Philippines and Bangladesh, and with USAID&#13;
involvement in a number of countries including Ghana,&#13;
Jamaica, and Tanzania. Initial results have been most&#13;
encouraging.&#13;
o    Integrated Training Programs, developed by the Economic&#13;
Development Institute of the World Bank. This method&#13;
combines short courses with project-related technical&#13;
assistance. Experimental programs in Niger and Tunisia&#13;
have encouraged participants to assess their own training&#13;
needs, have trained instructors, and have made selective&#13;
use of outside consultants to provide technical&#13;
knowledge.&#13;
O    Performance Improvement Planning (PIP), favored by the&#13;
ILO and the U.N., has been applied to public enterprises&#13;
in Bangladesh, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Nigeria,&#13;
Somalia, Sri Lanka, Syria, and Zambia (where public&#13;
enterprises and their supervising ministries participated&#13;
in the same exercise). Typically, the program begins&#13;
with diagnostic workshops in which senior managers&#13;
identify problems prevalent in their organizations and&#13;
devise solutions. Consultants and management specialists&#13;
play only a catalytic role. Instead of passively&#13;
attending lectures, participants collectively set targets&#13;
and prepare plans for pursuing them. Follow-up action is&#13;
specific and immediate, sometimes leading to dramatic&#13;
improvements. One airline turned a large loss into a&#13;
substantial profit within a year, and a postal and&#13;
telecommunications corporation far exceeded its targets&#13;
for new telephone connections.&#13;
O    Modular training, also used by the ILO, has been&#13;
effective in upgrading supervisory skills and knowledge&#13;
quickly. The training program consists of thirty-four&#13;
modules covering various aspects of management such as&#13;
finance and cost control, maintenance, purchasing, and&#13;
salary and wage administration. Specialized packages&#13;
have also been developed for public works and cooperative&#13;
management. Some of these modules are now available in&#13;
fourteen languages. The modules allow the users to&#13;
choose topics that are relevant to their organizations&#13;
and to incorporate local cases and problems into the&#13;
prepackaged materials. The effectiveness of modular&#13;
training can be enhanced if trainees, after trying to&#13;
implement what they have learned, are brought back to the&#13;
training institution to discuss their results and to work&#13;
out their own strategies for further action.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
In a companion paper, Kubr and Wallace (1983) discuss in greater detail these&#13;
and other new approaches to training that have resulted from initiatives by&#13;
international agencies in collaboration with developing country training&#13;
institutions.&#13;
In brief, although training alone is not a panacea for all&#13;
organizational ills, it is an important instrument for improving the&#13;
performance of the public service. Many developing countries still need to&#13;
expand their training infrastructure, but more important, they have yet to&#13;
remove the many inefficiencies in their public service training systems. To&#13;
be effective, however, such changes must be reinforced by parallel&#13;
improvements in personnel management. This issue is taken up in the following&#13;
section.&#13;
V. Personnel Policies and Management&#13;
If the public service in developing countries is to become more&#13;
performance oriented, public personnel systems must share and reinforce the&#13;
desire for this change. Although day-to-day management and motivation of&#13;
staff are the responsibility of line managers, public personnel systems often&#13;
limit the options available to thema through rules that govern how the staff&#13;
are selected, assigned, paid, and promoted. In most developing country&#13;
governments, personnel departments play a relatively passive (sometimes even&#13;
negative) role, administering these (mostly outdated) rules rather than&#13;
actively developing and pursuing policies for improving public sector&#13;
management. Instead, they should take an active role, not only by planning&#13;
and overseeing public service trairLing, but also by:&#13;
o    clarifying the status of the personnel function in&#13;
government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
o    improving the managerial capacity of personnel offices&#13;
o    building effective career-development systems&#13;
o    improving public sector pay and conditions&#13;
o    linking incentives more closely to performance.&#13;
This section is devoted to discussion of these five policy issues.&#13;
Role and Status of the Personnel Function&#13;
The management of human resources rarely receives as much attention&#13;
within government as the management of other, in particular financial,&#13;
resources. If lists were prepared of the most powerful ministries in&#13;
developing country governments, few would include personnel-related agencies,&#13;
whereas all would have the ministry of finance in its top ranks. One reason&#13;
for this is that lines of responsibility and accountability for effective use&#13;
of financial resources are more straightforward and clear than those for human&#13;
resources. Another is that personnel-related agencies have an unimpressive&#13;
record of contributions to major policy decisions--partly because few of them&#13;
have strong policy analysis capabilities and partly because little is known&#13;
about the best methods of utilizing people in different cultural and&#13;
organizational settings. In short, the low status of the personnel function&#13;
stems both from the inadequacies of most governmentwide personnel management&#13;
systems and the low priority assigned to human resource management in&#13;
government by the top decisionmakers. It is not surprising, therefore, that&#13;
personnel issues are regarded in most countries as administrative matters,&#13;
rather than management concerns that can make major contributions to the&#13;
achievement of social and economic goals.&#13;
The role and status problem can be solved first by making performance&#13;
and efficiency a prime consideration of personnel policy, and second by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
rethinking the role of the personniel function in government (to clarify&#13;
responsibilities and pinpoint accountability).&#13;
In most countries responsibility over personnel matters is highly&#13;
fragmented among three types of agencies: public or civil service&#13;
commissions, establishments or central personnel offices, and the departmental&#13;
personnel of fices. In addition, local government units and public enterprises&#13;
typically have different personnel. offices. Some countries, for example&#13;
Thailand and Indones4a, do not even have a single civil service as such;&#13;
rather, there are almost as many independent services as there are ministries,&#13;
each with its own personnel agency, traditions, and policies for recruitment,&#13;
placement, promotion, career development, and training. This diffusion of&#13;
responsibility often leads to confusion and inconsistency, and limits the&#13;
formulation and implementation of well coordinated personnel policies&#13;
throughout the public service (Bentil 1982).&#13;
The fragmentation issue has two dimensions. The first has to do with&#13;
centralization as against decentralization of the personnel function. The&#13;
second relates to the presence or absence of a "corporate management"&#13;
strategy, to borrow a term from private enterprises, for giving overall&#13;
direction to personnel matters in the light of the goals of the public&#13;
service.&#13;
Taking the decentralization question first, in theory, line managers&#13;
will manage better if they are given control over the use of all resources,&#13;
including human resources. This was recognized, for example, by the Glassco&#13;
and Lambert commissions in Canada during the 1960s and 1970s in their&#13;
recommendation that authority over personnel and finance matters be devolved&#13;
from the two central organs (the Treasury Board and the Civil Service&#13;
Commission) to departments and other agencies (Dwivedi 1982). The full&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
results of this effort are not yet known. As the Canadian commission&#13;
recognized, however, the success of this devolution is likely to depend on&#13;
whether the decentralized authority is accompanied by increased accountability&#13;
of departments and line managers and on whether the government can strengthen&#13;
its corporate management capabilities to oversee such a decentralized system.&#13;
The immediate implications of decentralization for developing&#13;
countries are threefold. First, a decentralized personnel system can be a&#13;
viable option if it iLs part of a larger decentralization effort, that is, if&#13;
authority over other decision areas are transferred simultaneous'ly to lower&#13;
units of government. Decentralizing only the personnel function in an&#13;
otherwise centralized system may create insurmountable problems in ensuring&#13;
performance accountability. Second, even if it were possible to decentralize&#13;
some aspects of personnel management (for example, recruitment, training,&#13;
promotion), there would still be a need for a politically independent agency&#13;
to oversee the protection of the merit principle (for example, a public&#13;
service commission). As it is far more difficult to decentralize this&#13;
function, a premature decentralization of most personnel functions may create&#13;
insurmountable coordination problems between the public service commission and&#13;
the decentralized personnel units. Third, as noted earlier, even a highly&#13;
decentralized personnel system requires a strong corporate management&#13;
capability at the center.&#13;
This last point, in many ways, is the most important one in that it&#13;
points to the need for: establishing a philosophy of management, taking stock&#13;
of the strengths and weaknesses of the nation's and the public service's human&#13;
resources, examining the personnel policy implications of maJor policy&#13;
directives of the government, contributing to the formulation of such&#13;
directives, and painstakingly weeding out outdated and inflexible rules and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
regulations and replacing them with more timely and performance-conscious&#13;
measures. To do all this, most countries will have to rethink the role of the&#13;
personnel management function within government and introduce structural&#13;
changes that will strengthen corporate management capabilities. The specific&#13;
solution will differ from country to country. In Canada, the Glassco&#13;
Commission's recommendations have led to a strategy of combining expenditure&#13;
and personnel management functions under one roof, the Treasury Board,&#13;
(Dwivedi 1982). Tanzania, meanwhile, gave the corporate management&#13;
responsibility over personnel matters to a cabinet-level entity, the Ministry&#13;
of Manpower Development establisshed in the mid-1970s. Sudan's Ministry of&#13;
Public Service and Administration Reform and Guyana's Ministry of Civil&#13;
Service are also examples of attempts to raise the status of the personnel&#13;
function in government and make it an integral part of public policy&#13;
formulation in all matters (Bentil 1982).&#13;
These changes relate mostly to the structural location and status of&#13;
the personnel function within government, and, in and of themselves, may do&#13;
little to strengthen corporate management capabilities. Steps may also be&#13;
taken to establish effective leadership over personnel matters and to&#13;
strengthen policy capabilities in central personnel offices.&#13;
The discussion above applies mainly to personnel management at the&#13;
central government level. The issues are different, and far more difficult to&#13;
address, in local government units. Smallness and the inadequacy of the&#13;
resource base prevent them from establishing full-fledged independent&#13;
personnel systems. Many developing countries have strengthened management&#13;
capabilities by integrating local government personnel systems either&#13;
horizontally with other local systems or vertically with the national system,&#13;
or both. Horizontal integration has evidently helped to unify local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
government services, standardize personnel procedures, and establish common&#13;
pension and salary ftnds in several countries, including Botswana, India,&#13;
Jamaica, and Nigeria (Cochrane 1983). Vertical integration, as in Egypt and&#13;
Tanzania, has helped to improve the career prospects of local officials and to&#13;
attract more competent staff to local government service.  Because it gives&#13;
local officials a chance to serve at the center, and vice versa, vertical&#13;
integration is a useful strategy, particularly in countries with a highly&#13;
centralized form of administration.&#13;
In brief, effective management of the public sector's human resources&#13;
depends on the status of the personnel function in government. That is to&#13;
say, fragmentation in personnel decisions must be avoided, and corporate&#13;
management capacities strengthened. This is the case for both centralized and&#13;
decentralized personnel systems. Moreover, the process of strengthening must&#13;
begin with improvements in policy and management capacities in central&#13;
personnel offices.&#13;
Management Capabilities of Personnel Offices&#13;
To plan the kind of active policy formulation and management role&#13;
described above, central personnel offices must be staffed with competent&#13;
specialists. Personnel offices in most developed countries are staffed with&#13;
generalists. An internal World Bank survey conducted for the World&#13;
Development Report 1983 shows that there are special career cadres for&#13;
personnel administrators in only 40 percent of the forty-five developing&#13;
countries for which data were available. That means the activities of most&#13;
personnel offices go little beyond record keeping and drafting personnel&#13;
procedures. More advanced techniques for studying personnel issues (such as&#13;
organization development, systems analysis, manpower planning, job evaluation,&#13;
position classification, performance assessment, counseling, staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
development, and various statistical methods) are rarely employed (Bentil&#13;
1982). As a result, personnel offices in most developing countries remain&#13;
staffed with public servants whc are in less demand elsewhere and who stress&#13;
passive administrative tasks over more controversial management concerns that&#13;
require robust policy research and analysis.&#13;
A short-term solution to the capability problem is to replace some of&#13;
the existing staff with competent specialists, and to train the rest. A more&#13;
lasting solution would be to improve the status and career prospects of&#13;
personnel specialists. In addition, line agency administrators can usefully&#13;
be seconded for a term of service in personnel offices to expand their&#13;
awareness and commitment to personnel policies, as well as to keep the&#13;
personnel office in close touch with client departments. Such exchanges are&#13;
likely to generate greater demand for better personnel management for the line&#13;
managers responsible for implementing personnel policies.&#13;
Efficient information systems are also critically needed. In many&#13;
developing countries, personnel records are maintained manually, are updated&#13;
infrequently, and are too cumbersome for the aggregate analysis needed for&#13;
formulating policies, determining staffing and training requirements, or&#13;
monitoring policy implementation. Micro-computers now offer new and&#13;
relatively inexpensive systems for quick and accurate information storage,&#13;
retrieval, and processing.&#13;
Most developed countries have devised computerized personnel&#13;
information systems. The system used by the U.K. civil service, for example,&#13;
enables the Central Civil Service Department to carry out timely and accurate&#13;
policy reviews and statistical analyses and thus has become an important tool&#13;
for planning and control. The system is also used by personnel offices in&#13;
individual departments, which cain now analyze on a regular basis recruitment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
and wastage issues, promotion prospects, pay trends, and the composition of&#13;
the civil service in terms of age, sex, length of service, and so on (Bamfield&#13;
1981). A similar trend is evident in some developing countries. The&#13;
government of Bangladesh, with World Bank assistance, is currently setting up&#13;
a personnel management information system in the Establishment Division, while&#13;
Venezuela's National Registry of Public Sector Human Resources has begun&#13;
compiling and analyzing information useful for the Central Personnel Office.&#13;
Personnel offices in most developing countries, however, still have a very&#13;
limited data base.&#13;
Career Development&#13;
An important way to improve the motivation and to facilitate the&#13;
training of public officials is to define possible career paths and to make&#13;
clear that advancement in the public service depends on experience, the&#13;
upgrading of skills, and performance. An effective device here is to&#13;
establish schemes of service clearly spelling out career paths for the most&#13;
common skill or occupational categories of staff. According to an internal&#13;
World Bank survey conducted in 1982, only 30 percent of the developing&#13;
countries have established such systems for scientists and about 40 percent&#13;
have them for economists, statisticians, personnel administrators, and&#13;
engineers. Specialist cadres are most common for accountants (56 percent of&#13;
the countries surveyed) and tax administrators (53 percent).&#13;
Public sector management cannot be strengthened, however, without&#13;
executive leadership.. A high level cadre of this type will have to be built&#13;
up, not only because such talent is scarce in developing countries, but also&#13;
because all countries should have a mechanism by which to provide a proper&#13;
balance between the forces demanding bureaucratic accountability to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
political leadership and those demanding that career civil servants be&#13;
insulated from undue political control and interference.&#13;
Different approaches have been tried; most derive from the British,&#13;
French, or American models. Selection for the elite cadres patterned on the&#13;
British or French administrative systems takes place mainly at the time of&#13;
entry into the civil service, whereas U.S. civil servants must have&#13;
considerable experience and specialization before they join the recently&#13;
established Senior Executive Service. Those who are likely to hold executive&#13;
posts in government for a long period are systematically nurtured in the&#13;
British and French models, a key feature of which is the esprit de corps among&#13;
the members of this select group. The American system, on the other hand, is&#13;
more open to lateral mobility: it does not obstruct the entry of experienced&#13;
outsiders or force government ofEficials who wish to take up opportunities&#13;
elsewhere to forfeit pensions and other benefits. An open system that permits&#13;
interchange of staff between the public, parastatal, and private sectors has&#13;
obvious advantages, since it encourages the transfer of ideas and proven&#13;
managerial practices. These and other differences among the various executive&#13;
leadership development models underscore the fact that each model is a&#13;
byproduct of the history and tradition of administration in a given society.&#13;
For this reason, an indigenously developed system may be more appropriate for&#13;
a developing country than one borrowed from another country. Establishing a&#13;
scheme of service for specialists or executives is not enough, of course. The&#13;
scheme has to be implemented so as to avoid both excessive internal mobility&#13;
and congestion at different points in the career channel.&#13;
Regarding mobility, frequent shuffling of civil servants can have&#13;
serious repercussions in institutional performance. That kind of shuffling&#13;
seems relatively common in developing countries, where more than one-third of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
the key economic decisionmakers--the permanent secretary of finance, the&#13;
national planning director, and the central bank governor--have each been&#13;
changed three or more times during the last five years, according to the&#13;
internal World Bank survey mentioned earlier. A good example is Turkey.&#13;
According to Heper (1982), from December 1, 1979, to May 1, 1980, 1,223 high-&#13;
ranking civil servants were removed from their posts and 1,367 appointed. The&#13;
same pattern is evident among public enterprise managers: in Turkey a&#13;
director-general of a state-owned enterprise kept his office for an average of&#13;
3.5 years during the 1962-74 period; however, this average dropped to 1.7&#13;
years during 1974-80, which was a period of ideological polarization and&#13;
political fragmentaton (Heper 1982).&#13;
The reshuffling problem is not limited to senior levels: in India,&#13;
six district collectors, five district development officers, and three&#13;
project-cum-tribal development officers in the Dharampur district changed&#13;
hands in a period of two years (Gupta 1981); in a Latin American country the&#13;
commercial, technical, financial, and administrative managers of the national&#13;
railway organization were changed four to six times during 1976-79. These&#13;
frequent changes, often the result of political patronage and nepotism,&#13;
jeopardize continuity in policy administration, necessitate constant&#13;
retraining of staff, and reduce efficiency and morale.&#13;
As for congestions in career channels, rapid and unplanned promotions&#13;
are a principal cause of this problem. Some governments have promoted young&#13;
and inexperienced civil servants into the upper grades, primarily to fill new&#13;
positions previously held by expatriates.  In other cases, changes in&#13;
government have brought further additions to the top layers of the civil&#13;
service because tenured senior bureaucrats have had to be shifted from their&#13;
previous government duties to others to make room for the more preferred&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
staff. In Turkey, for example, the number of civil servants in top grades&#13;
increased by 146 percent between 1976 and 1978, during a period of frequent&#13;
political changes, as compared with an increase of only 24 percent for lower&#13;
grades (Heper 1982).&#13;
Japan has dealt with bottlenecks in career channels by moving a&#13;
number of civil servants in their fifties out of line management posts to&#13;
staff or advisory roles, or by retiring them (Shurcliff 1970). Recently China&#13;
announced that it will now retire development directors and vice-ministers at&#13;
age 60 and ministers at age 65, to ease congestion in the top layers of the&#13;
public service (Morgan 1981). Such initiatives are particularly appropriate&#13;
when there are no serious skill shortages in an occupation and young&#13;
professionals need to feel that their career paths are not blocked for years&#13;
on end.&#13;
Salaries and Conditions&#13;
Well qualified staff will not be drawn toward and retained in the&#13;
public service without an offer of attractive compensation. Salary and&#13;
nonsalary benefits, the working environment, and career development schemes&#13;
must be competitive with alternative job opportunities, especially for&#13;
critical skills in short supply.  Too often, public service compensation&#13;
systems, though adequate for lowrer level staff, fail to attract and retain&#13;
qualified high level professionals, both managerial and technical.&#13;
The lack of published data makes it difficult to compare total&#13;
compensation packages available in the public and private sectors, but&#13;
scattered evidence indicates that average government pay in developing&#13;
countries is lower than that in the private sector. In the OECD region, the&#13;
ratio of government wages (exclusive of parastatals) to total wages in the&#13;
economy, and of government employment to total nonagricultural employment is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
roughly equal (19.7 percent and 19.0 percent, respectively); in these&#13;
countries, then, average government wage does not appear to be out of line&#13;
with the average wage La the private sector (Heller and Tait 1982). In fact,&#13;
the average public sector pay is better than :that in the private sector in&#13;
virtually all industrialized OECD countries (OECD 1982). In developing&#13;
countries, however, the government's share of total nonagricultural employment&#13;
(24.4) is somewhat higher than the share of the government's wages in total&#13;
wages (21.4); thus the average wage in government is probably lower than that&#13;
in the private sector (Heller and. Tait 1982).  Moreover, many developing&#13;
countries, for political arnd equity reasons, have raised the salaries of lower&#13;
level civil servants more quickly than those of top civil servants (Bennell&#13;
1981), and thereby have widened the Day differenitials between the public and&#13;
the private sector for high level. staffs As a result, in many countries the&#13;
outflow from the public sector is low or negligible for people in lower&#13;
grades, but high for top level staff .&#13;
In some countries, large private-public salary differentials have&#13;
caused a flight of highly skilled professionals to the local private sector&#13;
and to other states.  I.n Jordan, the salaries of government managers at the&#13;
undersecretary/director level were about one-third of their equivalents in the&#13;
private sector and slightly more than onLe-half the level in public&#13;
corporations. As a result, Jordan has been experiencing a sizable flow of&#13;
experienced staff to the private sector and to the nearby oil-producing states&#13;
(Socknat 1982).  Anotheir case in point is Turkey, where salaries for new&#13;
university graduates are about one and a half times higher in the private&#13;
sector, and much higher for many categories of experienced professional and&#13;
technical staff.  By contrast, qualified Dublic servants in some large Latin&#13;
American countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, are relatively well paid, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
evidenced by the difficulties faced by international organizations in&#13;
recruiting staff from these countries.&#13;
Hatters have been made worse by the drop in the real wages of public&#13;
servants in recent years. Even in the industrialized OECD countries, average&#13;
annual pay increases for public servants during the last five years have been,&#13;
on the average, about 87 percent of the average annual increase in consumer&#13;
prices (see Table 6).  Although comparable data are not available for&#13;
developing countries, ILO reports that public servants in most developing&#13;
countries have fared worse.  In India, for example, emoluments of central&#13;
government employees declined by 16-41 percent in real terms during 1973-78&#13;
(ILO 1983a). This general trend was evident in several other developing&#13;
countries.&#13;

Apart from pay,, individuals enter or stay in government for its other&#13;
benefits--such as status, interest, and security of tenure. For this reason,&#13;
complete equality between public and private sector pay is generally neither&#13;
necessary nor attainable. In Nigeria, the restructuring of public sector&#13;
salaries by the Udoji Commission in 1975 resulted in virtual parity, but the&#13;
private sector quickly restored its competitive pull for skills in short&#13;
supply. For most governments it would be prohibitively expensive both&#13;
economically and politically to match private sector salaries across the&#13;
board. To do so would simply push up private sector wages, where they do not&#13;
fully reflect the scarcity value of high-level staff, and would also widen the&#13;
gap between the incomes of public officials and these of the rest of the&#13;
population. Average government pay in developing countries is about 4.5 times&#13;
the per capita income; the corresponding ratio for OECD countries is 1.8&#13;
(Heller and Tait 1982).&#13;
The issue of disparities in salary levels is complicated by the use&#13;
of nonsalary "perks" to attract or retain staff. Most governments provide&#13;
their senior staff with substantial nonsalary benefits such as housing, cars,&#13;
directorship fees, medical care, and education. In most countries this&#13;
encourages public servants to seek new benefits while protecting those they&#13;
already have, often with damaging results.&#13;
A clear example is Indonesia, where civil servants are paid very low&#13;
salaries, but these are supplemented with a dazzling array of benefits,&#13;
including a family allowance, a supplement based on one's civil service rank,&#13;
rice and other food allowances, and, for some officials, cars, drivers, and&#13;
petrol allowances. To further complicate matters, many high level civil&#13;
servants are formally appointed to two, and sometimes three, government jobs,&#13;
and they draw salaries, allowances, and honoraria in each. The result is that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
government officials are lured away from the provinces and outer islands&#13;
toward the center where "perks" are more abundant. Also, staff gravitate to&#13;
agencies offering the most generous benefits and strive constantly to maintain&#13;
them (Warwick 1978; Gray 1979).&#13;
The perverse effects on performance of nonsalary "perks" are evident&#13;
elsewhere as well. Travel allowances are a good case in point. In some&#13;
countries (for example, Lesotho) they are so generous that middle and high&#13;
level officials have a strong incentive to spend a great portion of their time&#13;
traveling abroad, leaving the busiLness of running the government to their&#13;
subordinates. In others, a specific rule, such as an overnight allowance to&#13;
be given only if the individual travels at least a specified distance, often&#13;
serves as a disincentive to travel to certain locations. The provision of&#13;
subsidized housing generates similar dysfunctional behavior. Since not all&#13;
employees can be favored with housing benefits, civil servants engage in&#13;
intense maneuvering to secure and retain them. Also, because of high housing&#13;
rents in most urban centers, the housing benefit often serves as an important&#13;
disincentive to mobility.&#13;
Some governments attempt to retain important public officials by&#13;
giving them special allowances and benefits on a discretionary basis. In&#13;
theory, this adds flexibility to the system of rewarding high performance, but&#13;
in practice it creates tensions between superiors and subordinates, who may&#13;
become so tightly knit in a complex financial and social web that the&#13;
situation can easily degenerate into corruption. In Indonesia's civil&#13;
service, for example, projects included in the government's development budget&#13;
are provided with funds earmarked for the staff costs of execution and&#13;
supervision. The amounts vary fromn agency to agency and from project to&#13;
project, and are divided by supervisors into "honoraria" for staff. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
honoraria are assigned almost entirely at the discretion of supervisors; some&#13;
employees are given no project allowances, some more than one. The allowances&#13;
are given out--usually in sealed envelopes--as "fees" for attending&#13;
meetings. In addition, supervisors in some government agencies are authorized&#13;
to distribute "incentive bonuses" ranging from 20 to 100 percent of salaries&#13;
(Gray 1979; Warwick 1978).&#13;
Nonsalary benefit schemes must be designed and controlled so that&#13;
perverse behavior is not encouraged, while at the same time, the possible&#13;
gains from having a flexible compensation package are not sacrificed.&#13;
Discretionary benefits are best given to whole groups whose skills are in&#13;
short supply-statisticians and computer specialists, for example. In&#13;
addition, policymakers can ensure that a gross imbalance does not arise&#13;
between public and private sector salaries by conducting regular reviews of&#13;
public sector salaries, preferably as low profile internal exercises. In&#13;
Singapore and Malaysia public sector salaries are reviewed and adjusted&#13;
frequently to compensate for differences between the public and the private&#13;
sector and neither country has experienced a major brain drain problem. Such&#13;
reviews should also take into account nonpecuniary benefits resulting from&#13;
public employment and should eliminate or modify perks that produce perverse&#13;
behavior.&#13;
Linking Incentives With Performance&#13;
Early thinking on questions of job performance was influenced by the&#13;
argument that individuals would be motivated to perform their jobs effectively&#13;
If their needs were satisfied. Thus, job security, high wages, predictable&#13;
promotion practices, c:omfortable working conditions, and so on, were believed&#13;
to lead to higher job satisfaction, which in turn would result in increased&#13;
productivity. Empirical research on the job satisfaction-performance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
connection showed, however, that while satisfaction factors were important in&#13;
attracting and retaining individuals in an enterprise and in reducing&#13;
absenteeism, they had little effect on job performance. Findings from 20&#13;
empirical studies conducted in developed countries yielded a median&#13;
correlation coefficient of 0.14 between satisfaction and performance (Vroom&#13;
1964). This finding cast serious doubts on the view that performance could be&#13;
increased appreciably through increased job satisfaction.&#13;
Within the last few decades ideas about what determines the level of&#13;
performance shifted from satisfacition as a governing factor toward motivation&#13;
of individuals (through material and nonmaterial incentives).  The notion that&#13;
motivation can be enhanced by linking incentives with performance has its&#13;
roots in the scientific management methods of Frederick Taylor and a&#13;
substantial body of psychological research and theory. It is based on a&#13;
simple argument: an individual will be motivated to perform better if he is&#13;
convinced that his high performance will lead to outcomes he values and that&#13;
his low performance will generate outcomes he does not favor. Material&#13;
incentives, such as pay, allowances, and perks, help form a link between&#13;
motivation and performance through external rewards or stimuli. By contrast,&#13;
nonmaterial incentives, such as increased participation, considerate&#13;
supervisory behavior, and a challenging job, create conditions under which&#13;
effective performance itself will be a goal desired by the individual, rather&#13;
than a means towards the attainment of some other goal (for example, higher&#13;
pay). In the latter case, the incentives help generate internal stimuli that&#13;
will enhance emotional commitment of the individual to organizational goals&#13;
and to doing an effective job (Horton and King 1981; Vroom 1964; Cummings and&#13;
Schwab 1973).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
In general, private enterprises tend to link incentives, in&#13;
particular material incentives, with performance to a greater degree than the&#13;
public sector. There are several reasons for this. First, public&#13;
bureaucracies, and individual civil servants, are expected to serve social and&#13;
political objectives more so than private enterprises. Preoccupation with&#13;
objectives such as alleviating unemployment or reducing ethnic or socio-&#13;
economic disparities, though legitimate, inevitably divert attention from&#13;
operational efficiency and productivity. Second, in order to curb potential&#13;
abuses of political and bureaucratic power, civil service rules in many&#13;
countries tightly circumscribe the discretion allowed public managers in&#13;
rewarding excellence and penalizing poor performance. As a result, civil&#13;
servants are rewarded more for their seniority or educational attainments than&#13;
for their performance. Third, at the more operational level, many civil&#13;
service jobs do not easily lend themselves to objective output and efficiency&#13;
measurements, as the social costs and benefits of meeting political and social&#13;
goals are difficult to calculate. Finally, informal social relations between&#13;
managers and their subordinates are so strong in many countries that, even in&#13;
instances where output measures are available, supervisors often refrain from&#13;
conducting objective performance assessments that could jeopardize existing&#13;
patterns of workplace loyalties.&#13;
Linking material incentives with performance. The above&#13;
considerations notwithstanding, it is now widely accepted that enhancing the&#13;
performance orientation of the public service can be enhanced through higher&#13;
motivation of public servants towards job performance. Recognizing this,&#13;
several developing cotntries, including the Philippines, India, and Kenya,&#13;
have begun to devise performance appraisal systems that aim at linking&#13;
periodic merit pay increases and grade promotions to individual performance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
(U.N. 1982). Simple but effective performance appraisal systems that fully&#13;
recognize the cultural and political realities of the public service have yet&#13;
to be designed, however, in most developing countries.&#13;
Three key preconditions should be met before effective performance&#13;
appraisal systems can be instituted in the public service. First and&#13;
foremost, the managers and supervisors who are in positions to evaluate the&#13;
performance of others should themselves be held accountable for the&#13;
performance of their work units. A systemwide chain of performance&#13;
accountability would therefore have to be installed to link the successive&#13;
layers of management. This is a long-term proposition and demands a&#13;
reevaluation of accountability within the bureaucracy. Since most of the&#13;
present systems place greater importance on legal, fiscal, and procedural&#13;
accountability, managers put greater value on not making a legal, financial,&#13;
and procedural mistake than on achieving better results. A shift toward&#13;
performance budgeting, for example, could be the first step in establishing a&#13;
chain of performance accountability.&#13;
Second, the technical capacity of central personnel offices to devise&#13;
reliable, valid, and pragmatic performance appraisal systems should be&#13;
strengthened. Although many developing countries have adopted an open system&#13;
of reporting on the performance of employees, very few have designed and&#13;
tested the tools and the procedurets necessary for putting them into operation&#13;
or have trained managers and staff in their use (U.N. 1982).&#13;
Third, proceduralism and red tape in performance assessment and&#13;
promotion should be reduced. In A.fghanistan, for example, a single promotion&#13;
decision may require 54 operations, 20 reviews and inspections, and 73&#13;
movements of documents from one place to another. For an employee in a&#13;
provincial office, an additional 41 steps may be required (U.N., 1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
Although this is an extreme example, cumbersome procedures are common.&#13;
Systematic rationalization of civil service regulations, aimed at providing&#13;
added flexibility to reward and sanction policies, is needed in most&#13;
countries, without forfeiting accountability.&#13;
In theory, performance appraisal systems provide a close link between&#13;
monetary and other material incentives and job performance, but in practice&#13;
they are difficult to implement objectively, even in the most developed&#13;
countries. If they are to take hold over the long run, such systems require&#13;
persistent backing from the political and bureaucratic leadership and from the&#13;
public at large. In view of the difficulties noted above, and the high&#13;
potential of their misuse, developing countries should adopt a gradual,&#13;
experimental approach to the installation of appraisal systems. To increase&#13;
the motivation of civil servants, greater stress can be put simultaneously on&#13;
linking nonmaterial inLcentives with performance.&#13;
Linking nonmaterial incentives with performance. Because the effects&#13;
of nonmaterial incentives on motivation depend largely on sociocultural&#13;
factors, it is not possible to specify a precise set of measures applicable in&#13;
all settings. In some countries, where there is strong, long-term loyalty&#13;
among employers and employees, staff may require fewer short-term material&#13;
incentives, and increases in performance may depend on strengthening the&#13;
existing links between nonmaterial incentives and performance. In highly&#13;
individualized, competitive societies, where material incentives often play a&#13;
more dominant role, performance may possibly be enhanced by blending monetary&#13;
rewards with some nonmonetary incentives. Recent trends in the United States&#13;
and other western industrial countries toward humanization of the workplace&#13;
indicate that more people are coming to recognize the importance of&#13;
nonmaterial factors in increasing productivity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
Notwithstanding the constraints introduced by sociocultural settings,&#13;
there are four broad strategies for improving job performance through the use&#13;
of nonmaterial incentives: increasing subordinate participation in&#13;
decisionmaking, using supervisory relationships effectively, improving the&#13;
cohesiveness of the work group, and improving the content of jobs. These are&#13;
reviewed below.&#13;
Participation in decisionmaking is increasingly regarded as a basic&#13;
human right, as several countries (including Ecuador, India, Norway, Peru,&#13;
Portugal, Spain, Federal Republic of Germany, and Yugoslavia) have recently&#13;
demonstrated by incorporating the principle of workers' participation in their&#13;
national constitutions (Cordova :1982). In theory, participation enhances&#13;
productivity in three ways: first, it improves the "quality" of the decisions&#13;
reached, as they take into account the views of those who will eventually&#13;
implement them; second, it increases the speed and efficiency with which&#13;
decisions are implemented, because the subordinates as a group are more likely&#13;
to exert pressure on each other to fulfill their joint commitments; and third,&#13;
it makes people become more "ego involved" in decisions, as these decisions&#13;
become their own (Vroom 1964).&#13;
There is a growing body of empirical evidence showing gains in labor&#13;
productivity as a result of higheir levels of involvement of subordinates in&#13;
the making of the decisions they will subsequently carry out, though most of&#13;
this evidence is based on data from private enterprises (Horton and King&#13;
1981). The most far-reaching participatory models are found in Yugoslavia&#13;
(where workers commonly participate in decisionmaking in both the economic and&#13;
the noneconomic enterprises) and the Federal Republic of Germany (where a&#13;
system of comanagement is practiced in many large corporations). Forms of&#13;
participation practiced in other countries include collective bargaining&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
(which is the most generally accepted form in both the industrialized and the&#13;
developing countries), works councils, representation on company boards,&#13;
participation at the shop-floor level, and involvement in specialized&#13;
committees covering issues such as safety, productivity, health, job&#13;
classification, and training. These forms of participation has been expanding&#13;
rapidly in recent years (Schregle 1982; Cordova 1982). Another participatory&#13;
mechanism--redesigning work organization with the participation and&#13;
involvement of employees themselves--has also been effective in improving&#13;
productivity and job satisfaction, as demonstrated by recent field experiments&#13;
conducted in Norway, India, and Tanzania (Kanawaty 1981).&#13;
Considerate supervisory behavior has a positive effect on motivation,&#13;
particularly if it is practiced in response to high job performance, rather&#13;
than an invariant supervisory style. Empirical work conducted in the United&#13;
States and the United Kingdom shows a strong correlation between supervisors'&#13;
"attitude towards men" and the productivity of work units (Horton and King&#13;
1981). In most job settings, the key is to find the right balance between&#13;
employee-centered as against production-centered supervision that would be&#13;
conducive to higher productivity. This task requires training in methods of&#13;
supervision; such training is lacking in developing countries: only 7 to 10&#13;
percent of the supervisory staff have had some formal training in supervision&#13;
and the existing training facilities cover no more than 1 to 2 percent of the&#13;
annual requirements (ILO 1980).&#13;
The cohesiveness of the work group also effects productivity.&#13;
Individuals belonging to cohesive groups are likely to have higher rates of&#13;
job satisfaction and lower rates of tension, absenteeism, and turnover (Vroom&#13;
1964). This is certainly true for organizations employing group&#13;
decisionmaking as a management practice, as in some East Asian countries. It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
has also been found to be true, particularly in the aftermath of the&#13;
pioneering findings from the Hawrthorne experiments, in western countries.&#13;
Increased group cohesiveness can act as a doubled-edged sword, however. When&#13;
it is directed toward attainment of organizational goals, productivity rises,&#13;
but when it is used in opposition to the organization, productivity may&#13;
drop. This may be a risk worth taking, because opposition to the organization&#13;
is equally likely to form in the absence of human resource policies and&#13;
supervisory attitudes that foster group cohesiveness.&#13;
Finally, improving the job content--that is, modifying the scope,&#13;
breadth, and responsibility asso,ciated with the tasks assigned to an&#13;
individual--can lead to higher motivation and job performance, as illustrated&#13;
by several cases from developed and developing countries (Horton and&#13;
King 1981). This usually takes the form of increased specialization or either&#13;
vertical loading (more responsibiLlity) or horizontal loading (greater variety&#13;
of tasks). Persons with high achievement motivation may respond well to job&#13;
enlargement, and in societies where cooperative work group norms are&#13;
prevalent, enlargement may make more sense at the group level.&#13;
Modifying job content isi a productivity enhancing measure that can be&#13;
taken by line managers in the pubtlic service. To use this tool effectively,&#13;
however, a government would have to define, classify, and analyze all public&#13;
service jobs, a task that the central personnel office should undertake in&#13;
collaboration with departmental personnel offices and representatives of the&#13;
public servants. A major comprehensive effort in this direction is underway&#13;
in Bangladesh, but it is needed in many other developing countries.&#13;
The suitability of the four measures reviewed above to the&#13;
administrative culture of a given country is an important determinant of their&#13;
potential effectiveness. Wide-scale participation, for example, may both be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
unfeasible and ineffective in authoritarian administrative systems.&#13;
The same could be said for group cohesiveness in administrative settings that&#13;
place great value on individualism and competition. The other two measures,&#13;
relating to supervisory behavior and job content, however, depend to a large&#13;
degree on the discretion of individual managers and could be effective in all&#13;
settings.&#13;
VI. The Effects of Culture&#13;
It is easy to prescribe what is needed for successful management of&#13;
the public service. It is not so easy to adapt these requirements to the&#13;
cultural and political environments of individual countries. This is true&#13;
both for the management interventions proposed in this paper and for other&#13;
practices that organizations typically employ for managing people and tasks&#13;
(for example, management-by-objectives, inventory and quality control systems,&#13;
and financial management and other management information systems). Unless&#13;
these techniques and practices are designed to take account of the prevailing&#13;
cultural and political environment within the bureaucracy, they are likely to&#13;
fall far short of their potential effectiveness. Although several management&#13;
practices that have evolved in developed countries can be used effectively in&#13;
many developing countries, they need to be tailored to local realities. And&#13;
it is just as important to identify and develop indigenous management&#13;
practices.&#13;
Since the early 1950s the transfer of management practices from&#13;
developed to developing countries has been seen as the only viable option in&#13;
the absence of both proven local management traditions and local capabilities&#13;
to develop new systems quickly. The transfers have taken various forms:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
systems acquired as built-in components of new investment projects were&#13;
grafted onto the bureaucratic systems inherited form the pre-independence era;&#13;
multinational corporations continued to use the practices of the parent&#13;
company; and technical assistance, consultancy, fellowship, and training&#13;
programs acted as important transfer vehicles for foreign management practices&#13;
(ILO 1966; Kubr and Wallace 1983).&#13;
Decisions on the installation of a new management practice are&#13;
inevitably political in that the introduction of a new system often threatens&#13;
the internal balance of power within the institution-those who are likely to&#13;
benefit from the change support the idea, the others resist it. The more&#13;
alien an idea seems, the greater the opposition, and greater the threat to&#13;
the status quo. Bureaucratic politics continues to play a key role even after&#13;
the installation of the technique. Those who opposed the idea in the&#13;
beginning often offer covert resistance during the initial period of&#13;
implementation. Thus, the transferability of management practice across&#13;
countries is not purely a cultural issue; it is indeed highly political as&#13;
well.&#13;
On the cultural side, tlhe thesis that all western management&#13;
practices are universally applicable has been challenged on the basis of new&#13;
research findings highlighting the nature and importance of cultural&#13;
differences among nations; Japan's success in developing management practices&#13;
consistent with its own societal values; and the frequent failures of some&#13;
management practices transplanted across cultural boundaries. These three&#13;
trends are reviewed below.&#13;
The Many Dimensions of Culture&#13;
Michel Crozier (1964) and Ross Webber (1977) argue convincingly that&#13;
culture, as it affects the behaviors approved and disapproved in a societal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
setting, strongly influences the nature of human relationships within&#13;
organizations, whether between individuals, between a supervisor and a&#13;
subordinate, or among groups. Work by psychologists, particularly David&#13;
McClelland (1961), reinforces this view by illustrating the variation across&#13;
countries in the achievement needs of different social groups. Finally,&#13;
recent work by Moris (1977) and Mendoza (1977) provide firm examples from East&#13;
African and Asian settings, respectively, which demonstrate the cultural&#13;
traits that distinguish these societies from others.&#13;
None of these earlier works, however, provide a broad, comparative&#13;
picture of values and cultural characteristics thath cut across international&#13;
boundaries. A recent study by Hofstede (1980a) is an exception. On the basis&#13;
of 116,000 responses from the employees of a large multinational corporation&#13;
in 40 countries, Hofstede identifies four main dimensions that account for a&#13;
great share of the cultural differences among the countries surveyed: (1)&#13;
individualism as against collectivism, (2) uncertainty avoidance (that is,&#13;
attitudes toward risk-taking and stability), (3) power distance (defined as&#13;
the society's attitude toward power and its distribution), and (4) masculinity&#13;
as against femininity (which shows the extent to which the dominant values in&#13;
society emphasize assertiveness, acquisition of many things, ambition, and&#13;
performance).&#13;
Hofstede observes that individualist societies (many Western&#13;
countries led by the United States) exhibit a loosely knit social framework in&#13;
which individual freedom is greatly valued and social behavior is primarily&#13;
motivated by self-interest. By contrast, in collectivist societies (for&#13;
example, Mexico, Pakistan, Singapore, and Thailand) people are closely tied&#13;
with an in-group--such as relatives, tribe, or organizationr--and expect the&#13;
group to look after them in exchange for absolute loyalty to it. In countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
where strong uncertainty avoidanace is observed (for example, Belgium, France,&#13;
Greece, Japan, Peru, and Portugal), individuals feel threatened by uncertain&#13;
and ambiguous situations and avoid them by providing greater career stability&#13;
and more formal rules and by nol: tolerating deviant ideas and behaviors. In&#13;
countries which tolerate large power distances among people (for example,&#13;
Brazil, Colombia, France, Mexico, the Philippines, Turkey, Venezuela, and&#13;
Yugoslavia) the use of hierarchical authority and rules are more readily&#13;
accepted than in small power distance cultures (for example, Ireland, New&#13;
Zealand, and the Scandinavian countries).&#13;
The relationships Hofstede finds among these four dimensions are not&#13;
surprising. By and large, individualist societies tend to emphasize greater&#13;
equality, whereas people in collectivist cultures believe more strongly in&#13;
large "power distances." Similarly, equality appears to be emphasized more&#13;
strongly in societies where risk taking is highly valued. There is also a&#13;
strong relationship between individualism and per capita income; individualist&#13;
societies are among the richest in Hofstede's sample.&#13;
Although the specific conclusions of this study regarding individual&#13;
countries could be questioned, as is the case in most empirical studies of&#13;
this type, the main thrust of the findings appears to have some validity. The&#13;
patterns of cultural variability illustrated by this set of data have&#13;
important implications for the appropriateness of specific management models&#13;
to a given societal setting. In individualist societies, for example, the&#13;
task is central and the relationships among people are more peripheral and&#13;
fluctuating than in collectivist cultures. Thus, a management model such as&#13;
matrix organization has a far greater chance of success in these settings than&#13;
in collectivist cultures where social relationships matter at least as much as&#13;
task requirements. Similarly, the use of hierarchical management models, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
in pyramidal bureaucracies, are more appropriate in societies that place&#13;
greater value on large power distances among individuals.&#13;
The upshot of this body of research is that culture matters.  Because&#13;
managing people is the essence of management, the techniques and practices&#13;
adopted for managing an. organization should not conflict with the general&#13;
values, attitudes, and behavior patterns of staff. At the very least, this&#13;
requires careful examination of the value assumptions embodied in a given&#13;
management practice bef ore it is considered for adoption in an organizational&#13;
setting and adapted to the local circumstances, if necessary.  It is far&#13;
better, however, to use! locally developed models.&#13;
The Japanese Case&#13;
Japan's success during a period of high growth in adopting U.S.-based&#13;
quantitative management: techniques while developing a management style&#13;
consistent with its own societal values and attitudes has shown that countries&#13;
can benefit from attempts to devise "home-grownL" management practices. The&#13;
techniques (for example, information-based scheduling, production or inventory&#13;
management systems, and techniques based on operations research or systems&#13;
analysis models) Japan has successfully transferred from the United States are&#13;
mainly of a quantitative nature, that have little to do with the underlying&#13;
behavior of their users , Most of these have an internal deductive logic that&#13;
is applicable everywhere. Although the installation and implementation of&#13;
these techniques may create problems of a political nature and users may have&#13;
to be trained extensively before they can be applied, cultural compatibility&#13;
is often not the major issue. The opposite is true of "qualitative"&#13;
management practices, which are not applicable everywhere because they do&#13;
include underlying assumptions about the behavior of the users.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
The qualitative managemoent practice that has emerged in Japan&#13;
basically mirrors the key values and attitudes embedded in Japanese society.&#13;
Accordingly, there is less emphasis on the individual than the group, and&#13;
interdependence, subordination, and obligation toward others are valued more&#13;
highly than self-assertion and preoccupation with one's own needs and&#13;
aspirations. Voluntary cooperation dominates self-interested individualistic&#13;
behavior, and discipline and self-restraint are valued more highly than&#13;
ambition and competitiveness. Harmony and avoidance of conflict are desired&#13;
societal and organizational goals, and living up to one's obligations and&#13;
making the maximum contribution to the work group are desirable individual&#13;
qualities (Hawrylyshyn 1980; Ouchi 1981; Hatvany and Pucik 1981.)&#13;
The Japanese management practice emerging from these societal traits,&#13;
which have been oversimplified here for the sake of illustration, essentially&#13;
puts the emphasis on groups rather than the individuals. Although group-based&#13;
decisionmaking increases the time required to reach decisions, it speeds&#13;
implementation, in that most problems are ironed out during the process of&#13;
reaching a consensus and therefore there is little internal resistance to the&#13;
decision during its execution. Life-long employment, based on mutual&#13;
obligations and loyalty, is the ncrm in most large enterprises. This practice&#13;
ensures that individuals accept responsibility without authority. In this&#13;
system, pay and promotion can be based mainly on seniority, as individuals can&#13;
be readily motivated with nonmaterial rewards for their performance&#13;
(Hawrylyshyn 1972; Nadler 1976.)&#13;
Transferring this type of a management practice to a western&#13;
environment is as difficult as using western practices in the Japanese&#13;
setting. As most individuals raised in western countries do not share the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
values embedded in Japanese practices, such transfer attempts would require&#13;
considerable adaptation.&#13;
There is no straightforward answer to the question of how other&#13;
countries could devise their own brands of management, a la Japan. As in&#13;
western countries and in Japan, this is a case more of an evolutionary process&#13;
of trial and error to see what works and what does not, than complete overhaul&#13;
of an existing practice. Expanding research to identify and examine&#13;
indigenous practices can help, but that would call for joint endeavors by&#13;
universities, management training institutes, and organization development&#13;
units within the public service. A similar effort is needed to examine ways&#13;
of successfully adapting quantitative as well as qualitative management&#13;
techniques and processes that have been shown to work in other settings.&#13;
These efforts should be reinforced with a flexible attitude toward trying&#13;
promising solutions in a limited number of organizations to test their&#13;
potential for wide-scale applicability.&#13;
Some Failures in the Transfer of Management Technology&#13;
Most of the so-called "modern" management techniques and processes&#13;
originated in the United States. They were initially tried and developed&#13;
either in the private industry or the military and subsequently used in other&#13;
units of government. Most of these have been transferred successfully to&#13;
other countries, particularly in western Europe and Latin America. The few&#13;
cases of failure noted in the literature involve mainly the attempts to&#13;
transfer qualitative management practices of U.S. origin. Such practices may&#13;
not fit into the cultural setting of the receiving organization.&#13;
Consider, for example, what happened when a number of countries tried&#13;
to introduce management by objectives (MBO). In France, the system was never&#13;
fully accepted, despite a change in its name to "participative management by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
objectives," because MBO "presupposes a depersonalized authority in the form&#13;
of internalized objectives; but French people, from their early childhood&#13;
onward, are accustomed to large power distances, to an authority that is&#13;
highly personalized" (Rofstede 1980b, p.59). MBO, however, was not greeted&#13;
with as much resistance in Germany, because some of its features, such as&#13;
co-determination of objectives arLd clear specification of tasks, conform well&#13;
to typical German values and attitudes (Hofstede 1980b). The fate of MBO in&#13;
Nigeria was similar to that in France: the implementation of the Udoji&#13;
Commission's recommendation to install a governmentwide MBO system has not&#13;
been implemented to date. It is not clear, however, if this is due to&#13;
political resistance or cultural incompatability between MBO and the broad&#13;
elements of the Nigerian culture.&#13;
A second example comes from Vietnam. In his study of cultural&#13;
receptivity to induced administrative change, Nguyen Quoc Tri reports that&#13;
several administrative practices borrowed from the United States that were&#13;
either of a technical nature (for example, procedural reforms in organization&#13;
and methods) or that reinforced local values (for example, systems of central&#13;
coordination and leadership) were transplanted successfully in Vietnam. But,&#13;
"those transferred items which ran counter to the prevailing local values,&#13;
such as local democracy, decentralization, position-classification,&#13;
performance budgeting, participative learning, and team research have been&#13;
rejected either at the outset or through their gradual disappearance" (Tri&#13;
1971, p.43).&#13;
Cultural factors have clearly played an important role in the&#13;
rejection or failure of the management practices cited in these examples.&#13;
However, culture is not the only factor that accounts for the success or&#13;
failure of a management transfer. As noted earlier, political factors are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
also important. A third factor is the organizational context into which such&#13;
transfers are made. Korten (1980) has noted that many western management&#13;
practices were developed to improve already well developed organizational&#13;
settings. These individual techniques or practices are often transplanted&#13;
into less well institutionalized environments in developing countries for the&#13;
purposes of system development even though they may be ill-suited for these&#13;
environments. The absence of other supporting organizational elements thus&#13;
reinforces cultural incompatibilities and leads to the failure of the&#13;
transfer.&#13;
In summary, the best clues as to how to manage people effectively&#13;
come from culture. Since it is less easy to change a culture than a&#13;
management practice, developing countries should not attempt to force a&#13;
management technique upon an organization if the technique appears&#13;
incompatible with the prevailing values and attitudes. Although&#13;
simplification and adaptation of the practice could lead to an improvement,&#13;
indigenously developed systems--because they follow an organic as opposed to&#13;
an induced model of change--have a far greater chance of success.&#13;
VII. Conclusions&#13;
Better management of the public service requires action on three&#13;
fronts: the structural barriers to efficient management must be removed; the&#13;
quality and allocation of human, financial, informational, and physical&#13;
resources must be improved; and the systems and processes used for managing&#13;
these resources must be reoriented towards performance goals. Because action&#13;
is often necessary in all three areas, management reform should be conceived&#13;
as a comprehensive exercise that takes into account the interrelatedness of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
the three groups of factors. The implementation of the reform package,&#13;
however, should be incremental, sequential, and adaptive, and should allow&#13;
room for continuous revision of the initial design on the basis of what is&#13;
learned. Although the interrelatedness of factors affecting public service&#13;
performance calls for comprehensiveness, limited knowledge of the potential&#13;
effects of a specific measure in a given circumstance demands a more cautious,&#13;
incremental strategy.&#13;
The key is to maintain continuity in management reform. One-shot&#13;
exercises, such as those conductedi occasionally by public service review&#13;
commissions, often generate a blueprint for reform, but make no provision for&#13;
learning or for modifying the bluetprint during implementation. To generate&#13;
such a capacity, it is often necessary to set up a permanent institution,&#13;
either in the form of a ministry (such as Brazil's Ministry of&#13;
Debureaucratization) or a high-level government agency (such as Japan's&#13;
Administrative Management Agency).&#13;
The policy suggestions made in this paper could form part of the&#13;
reform agenda of such an agency. However, as this paper's main focus is on&#13;
ways of better managing the human resources of the public service, these&#13;
should be supplemented with measures directed at better management of&#13;
financial, physical, and informational resources.&#13;
The principal findings that emerge from this paper can be summarized&#13;
as follows:&#13;
o    Public service employment in developing countries has&#13;
been growing about four times as fast as in developed&#13;
countries in recent years, partly in response to the&#13;
demand for improved services and in part because of the&#13;
desire of some government:s to improve tribal, ethnic, or&#13;
regional representation, Dr to use public employment as a&#13;
means for combating unemployment. However, on a per capita&#13;
basis, developed countries still have more than twice the&#13;
number of public servants as the developing countries.&#13;
Although the public service's share in non-agricultural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
employment is larger in developing countries, analysis of&#13;
cross-sectional data suggests that this differential is&#13;
likely to narrow as a result of increases in the per capita&#13;
income of developing countries.&#13;
o    In several developing countries the public service is&#13;
overstaffed at lower levels but faces shortages of&#13;
professional and technical skills. Three factors&#13;
contribute to these shortages: inadequacy and uneven&#13;
quality of secondary and higher education,&#13;
inappropriateness of public sector compensation&#13;
systems to attract and retain competent people, and,&#13;
in some countries, brain drain.&#13;
O    Training receiLves less emphasis in the public service in&#13;
developing coumtries than in public sector organizations&#13;
in industrialized countries, or private enterprises, or&#13;
multinational corporations. In addition, most public&#13;
service training offered in developing countries is not&#13;
relevant to the demands of the job. Improvements in&#13;
training systems require the following actions: raising&#13;
the status of the training function in government;&#13;
preparing training policies and plans; forging closer&#13;
links between training and other areas of personnel&#13;
management; strengthening the links between training,&#13;
research and consultancy; and expanding international&#13;
cooperation in training.&#13;
O    A strong civil service requires a personnel office that&#13;
actively manages rather than passively administers&#13;
personnel policies. Ways to strengthen personnel&#13;
management include clarifying the role and raising the&#13;
status of the personnel function in government, improving&#13;
the managerial capacity of personnel offices, building&#13;
effective career development systems, improving public&#13;
sector pay and conditions, and linking material and&#13;
non-material incentives more closely to performance.&#13;
O    The thesis that all western management practices are&#13;
universally applicable has been challenged in recent&#13;
decades on three grounds: new research findings&#13;
highlighting the nature and importance of cultural&#13;
differences among nations, Japan's success in developing&#13;
management practices consistent with its own societal&#13;
values, and frequent failures of some management&#13;
practices transplanted across cultural boundaries.&#13;
Although some quantitative management techniques that&#13;
have evolved in developed countries can be used&#13;
successfully in developing countries after some&#13;
adaptation, the transfer of people-oriented qualitative&#13;
management practices may require considerable tailoring&#13;
to make them consistent with local political and cultural&#13;
realities. As indigeneously developed qualitative&#13;
management practices may have a greater chance of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
success, developing countries should invest in the&#13;
identification, developument, and testing of such systems.&#13;
Development, by and large, is mar-made. Abundant natural resources,&#13;
although important, are neither necessary nor sufficient for sustained&#13;
growth. The excellent performance of countries like Japan, Switzerland, and&#13;
the Republic of Korea amply demonstrate that the lack of resources is not an&#13;
insurmountable barrier to rapid development. Conversely, natural wealth, as&#13;
in Zaire, is no guarantee of swift takeoff. Land and minerals are "passive"&#13;
factors to be exploited through human organizational and technical skills.&#13;
Thus, a country's development perjEormance turns largely on its ability to&#13;
properly allocate, upgrade, and manage its human resources. Strategies, such&#13;
as those advocated in this paper, can help bring the human element to the&#13;
forefront of discussions on development and start a turnaround in development&#13;
performance.&#13;

            Managing the public service in developing
            countries : issues and prospects
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Better management of the public service
            requires action on three fronts: the structural barriers to
            efficient management must be removed; the quality and
            allocation of human, financial, informational, and physical
            resources must be improved; and the systems and processes
            used for managing these resources must be reoriented toward
            performance goals. Of these, this paper focuses mainly on
            ways of better managing the human resources of the public
            service. Public service employment in developing countries
            has been growing about four times as fast as in developed
            countries in recent years. In many countries, overstaffing
            at lower levels is accompanied by shortages of professional
            and technical staff. These shortages are exacerbated by the
            "brain drain." Problems of public service training
            systems in developing countries lead to five policy
            recommendations: raising the status of the training function
            in government; preparing national training policies and
            plans; forging closer links between training and other areas
            of personnel management; strengthening the links between
            training, research, and consultancy; and expanding
            international cooperation in training.
