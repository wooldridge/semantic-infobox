            Private participation in the rail sector -
            recent trends
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This note focuses on rail projects with
            private participation, that reached financial closure in
            1990-1997, surveying regional trends, types of private
            participation, and project size. Through database analysis,
            the paper reveals that operations, and management contracts
            - including leases and concessions - are more common than
            green-field projects, or divestitures -, and, that private
            participation is more common for freight, than passenger
            services, with Latin America leading the new wave of private
            railway projects. It further illustrates the continued trend
            to private participation among the different regions,
            revealing the importance of establishing flexible contracts,
            and setting clear re-negotiations, or other adjustment
            mechanisms in advance. Experience from developed countries
            convey lessons with different models of private involvement,
            such as the benefits of splitting infrastructure provision
            from service operation, which often fostered reforms, and,
            may possibly offer one solution to access pricing issues,
            when facing vertically integrated companies, concessioned
            with open access requirements.
