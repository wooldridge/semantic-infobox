(FAO 2011).1â&#128;&#132;Yet women farmers are consistently&#13;
found to be less productive than male farmers. The             value of output (in local currency)&#13;
gender gap in agricultural productivityâ&#128;&#148;measured by&#13;
the value of agricultural produce per unit of cultivated&#13;

landâ&#128;&#148;ranges from 4 to 25Â percent, depending on the&#13;
country and the crop (World Bank and ONE 2014).2               fact that the gender gap persists suggests that the&#13;
                                                               underlying constraints are still inadequately tackled&#13;
This gap exists because women frequently have                  in agricultural policy strategies and programs. Low&#13;
unequal access to key agricultural inputs such as land,        agricultural productivity tends to reduce per hectare&#13;
labor, knowledge, fertilizer, and improved seeds. The 3        yields and leads to more intense farmingâ&#128;&#148;resulting&#13;

   I   n the three countries profiled in this report, female farm managers&#13;
       are found to have lower levels of education and a smaller average&#13;
    family size, and to be less wealthy compared to all other plot managers.&#13;

    them are widowed, divorced, or separated, compared to only 3Â percent       In Uganda, women managers cultivate plots that are on average&#13;

                  in agricultural productivity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  1   Traditionally, agricultural productivity is measured based&#13;
                      on household-level analysis. In contrast, we here look at&#13;
                  the plot level and identify the plot manager, measuring the&#13;
                                                                                     in two scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that there is&#13;
                                                                                     no difference between male and female agricultural outputâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
                                                                                     that is, there is no gender gap and agricultural productivity&#13;
                  difference in productivity between plots cultivated by women       of womenâ&#128;&#153;s plots is equal to plots cultivated by men. In the&#13;
                  and men. We convert the agricultural output produced by            second scenario, we use the actual productivity estimates&#13;
                  women and men farmers on their plots into monetary values          obtained in the first step to calculate the value of output&#13;
                  by multiplying the output obtained per unit of land with           obtained from female plots in the presence of the gender gap.&#13;
                  the median unit and crop-specific price in the respective          The difference between the no gender gap scenario and the&#13;
                  enumeration area (or at a higher level of aggregation if           gender gap scenario gives the additional output value from&#13;
                  needed). In Tanzania and Uganda, output was measured in            closing the gender gap in productivity.&#13;
                  kilograms; in Malawi, a wide range of measurement units was&#13;
                  employed. We then aggregate the total value of all crops per&#13;
                  unit of land associated with each gender. The difference in&#13;
                  this value between womenâ&#128;&#153;s and menâ&#128;&#153;s plots constitutes the&#13;
                                                                                     3   The final step includes computing the size of the gap&#13;
                                                                                         relative to agricultural GDP. To do this, we first need to&#13;
                                                                                     know what fraction of agricultural GDP comes from crop&#13;
                  unconditional gender gap in agricultural productivity. This        production. Second, we need to know the share of agricultural&#13;
                  is the first step in estimating the national income that is        GDP in overall GDP. Because growth in the agricultural sector&#13;
                  foregone because of the gender agricultural productivity gap.      influences other sectors of the economy, the cost of the&#13;
                                                                                     gender gap is likely higher than just the foregone agricultural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  2   As a next step, we calculate the fraction of land cultivated&#13;
                      by women and men, after accounting for the fact that&#13;
                  women cultivate smaller plots than men. For example, in&#13;
                                                                                     GDP. To take this into account, we use an estimate of the&#13;
                                                                                     multiplier between agricultural sector growth and the rest&#13;
                                                                                     of the economy obtained from other studies in Malawi,&#13;
                  Tanzania, women cultivate 20Â percent of the cultivated             Tanzania, and Uganda (Benin et al. 2008; Mabiso, Pauw,&#13;
                  plots but because their plots are on average smaller by            and Benin 2012; Pauw and Thurlow 2011).&#13;
                  0.47 hectares, women manage only about 13Â percent&#13;
                  of the land. Combining this fraction with the estimated            A more technical description of the methodology is given&#13;
                  gender gap in agricultural productivity, we compute the            in appendix A.&#13;
                  percentage difference between harvested value of output&#13;

              Because agriculture also employs more than two-                        soil erosion, and land degradationâ&#128;&#148;which in turn&#13;

              reducing poverty. Moreover, improvements in the                        We treat the plot of land, with identification of the&#13;
              agricultural sector may have considerable spillover                    gender of the plot manager or decision maker, as&#13;

Second, policies could focus on enabling womenâ&#128;&#153;s               Women are more time constrained than men in many&#13;

A key finding of this report is that women are less likely&#13;
to grow cash crops and that this plays a significant           equality and challenging social&#13;
role in the gender productivity gap. Too often, women&#13;
may shy away from growing higher-value crops due&#13;

cash crops is culturally seen as a male activity (Hill         There are a number of policy options for either&#13;
and Vigneri 2014). Because women cultivate smaller             enabling women to raise their productivity for the&#13;
plots, they may not be inclined to cultivate cash              crops they already grow or for incentivizing them&#13;
crops because of the need to scale up (Fafchamps               to shift into more profitable crops. Strengthening&#13;
1992). Moreover, because women seldom own land                 female farmer groups may allow women to not only&#13;
and/or have weak land tenure rights, they may be               scale up investments but also access markets by&#13;
less motivated to make investments in cash crop                reducing unit costs. Such interventions can also&#13;

&amp;#12;              on average, 0.046 hectares smaller than menâ&#128;&#153;s plots,            crop production forms 83Â percent of total agricultural&#13;
              the proportion of area under womenâ&#128;&#153;s control is about           GDP. This 7.3Â percent higher crop output translates&#13;
              24Â percent.                                                     to a 6.06Â percent higher agricultural GDP, which is&#13;
                                                                              roughly around $89.9Â million (in 2010 prices).&#13;
              Substituting equation A.2 into equation A.3 gives&#13;
              the total harvested value, Q, in the presence of the            Because of the many economywide spillover effects&#13;
              identified gender gap in agricultural productivity. We          between the agricultural sector and the rest of the&#13;
              term this scenario the baseline. We can also obtain             economy, total GDP is expected to be higher by more&#13;
              the potential harvest value, Q*, under the scenario             than the $89.9Â million. We need an estimate of the&#13;
              of no gender gap in agricultural productivity, that is,         multiplier between the agricultural sector and the&#13;
              when Yf = Ym .                                                  rest of the economy. Here we draw on economywide&#13;
                                                                              models for each country. For instance, the multiplier&#13;
              The additional output from closing the gender gap               for Malawi is about 1.11, implying that each additional&#13;
              in agricultural productivity, as a proportion of the            dollar generated in the agricultural sector leads to an&#13;
              baseline harvest value, is expressed as follows.                additional $0.11 in benefits in the non-agricultural&#13;
                                                                              sector (Benin et al. 2008). Consequently, the&#13;
              	Î&#148; = (Q*â&#136;&#146;Q)/Q	(A.4)&#13;
                                                                              $89.9Â million higher agricultural GDP in Malawi due&#13;
              In Malawiâ&#128;&#153;s case, closing the unconditional gender              to closing the agricultural gender productivity gap&#13;
              gap will lead to an increase of total crop harvest of           results in a total benefit of $99.8Â million added to total&#13;
              7.3Â percent.                                                    GDP. Overall, total GDP will be higher by 1.85Â percent&#13;

              To link the increase to agricultural GDP and total&#13;
              GDP, we need a few more pieces of information. First,&#13;
              we need to know what fraction of agricultural GDP&#13;
              comes from crop production.3 For example, in Malawi&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              3&#13;
                Agricultural GDP includes forestry, hunting, finishing,&#13;
              livestock, and crop production (again, see the World&#13;
              Development Indicators table notes available at http://&#13;
              data.un.org/_Docs/WDI%20definitions.pdf). We separate&#13;
              the specific contribution of each subsector of agriculture to&#13;
              total agricultural GDP from the national account statistics&#13;
              of each country. For Malawi, the national accounts&#13;
              report a combined figure for crop production, livestock&#13;
              production, and hunting. A 2005 FAO country brief reports       from agricultural GDP to obtain an estimate of crop GDP,&#13;
              that livestock constitutes 9.9Â percent of agricultural          which is about 83Â percent of agricultural GDP. Using the&#13;
              GDP. We therefore assume that livestock production as           Malawi Social Accounting Matrix for 2004, Benin et al.&#13;
              aÂ percentage of agricultural GDP has remained largely           (2008) estimate that crop GDP is close to 86Â percent of&#13;
              unchanged since those earlier studies and is about              agricultural GDP. The difference between the two sources is&#13;
              10Â percent. In 2010, fisheries and forestry constituted about   small and is driven by the different estimates of the size of&#13;
              7Â percent of agricultural GDP in Malawi. We subtract the        the livestock sector. As is our practice throughout the paper,&#13;
              contributions of livestock, fisheries, and forest production    we report results with the more conservative estimates.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;&amp;#12;UN WOMEN, grounded in the vision of equality as enshrined in the Charter of the&#13;
United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls;&#13;
the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men&#13;
as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action, and&#13;
peace and security. Placing womenâ&#128;&#153;s rights at the center of all its efforts, UN Women&#13;
leads and coordinates United Nations system efforts to ensure that commitments on&#13;
gender equality and gender mainstreaming translate into action throughout the world.&#13;
It provides strong and coherent leadership in support of Member Statesâ&#128;&#153; priorities and&#13;
efforts, building effective partnership with civil society and other relevant actors.&#13;
&#13;
The WORLD BANK GROUP (WBG) is a vital source of financial and technical assistance&#13;
to developing countries around the world. The formation of a unified WBG has created a&#13;
unique partnership working to end extreme poverty within a generation and boost shared&#13;
prosperity. The World Bank Africa Region Gender Innovation Labâ&#128;&#153;s (GILâ&#128;&#153;s) analytical&#13;
work underpins World Bank financing and helps inform the development communitiesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
investments. Through conducting impact evaluations, the GIL supports the design&#13;
of innovative, scalable interventions to address gender inequality across Africa, with&#13;
the goal of enabling project teams and policy makers to advocate for better gender&#13;
integration using evidence.&#13;
&#13;
The POVERTY-ENVIRONMENT INITIATIVE (PEI) of the United Nations Development&#13;
Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) supports&#13;
country-led efforts to mainstream poverty-environment linkages into national&#13;
development planning and budgeting. PEI provides financial and technical assistance&#13;
to government partners to set up institutional and capacity-strengthening programs&#13;
and carry out activities to address the particular poverty-environment context. PEI is&#13;
funded by the governments of Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the&#13;
European Union and with core funding of UNDP and UNEP.&#13;
