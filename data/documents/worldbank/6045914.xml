            Regualtion and competition : how antitrust
            and sector regulation affect telecom competition
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Countries with fully liberalized
            telecommunications markets have adopted different mixes of
            antitrust and sector-specific regulatory instruments. Does
            the balance between the two approaches matter for
            competitiveness? Drawing on the experiences of Australia,
            Chile, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United
            States, this Note finds that it does matter. Countries that
            get the balance right tend to have more competitive
            telecommunications markets.
