The development of the Water Sector Reform Communication Strategy has benefited from the &#13;
contributions of many organizations and individuals.  The German Technical Cooperation  (GTZ) and &#13;
the Water and Sanitation Program  Africa  (WSPAF) provided financial and technical support and we &#13;
would like to thank Ralf Wegener, Stephanie Gakuo, and Steven Shalita from GTZ, and Japheth Mbuvi &#13;
and Sarah de Villiers Leach from WSPAF for their input throughout the process.  &#13;
&#13;
The process benefited from the guidance of many individuals from the Ministry of Water Resources &#13;
Management and Development and it is unfortunately not possible to mention all of them by name. We &#13;
would however particularly single out for mention the guidance received from the Hon. Minister, &#13;
Martha Karua and the Permanent Secretary, Prof George Krhoda, during the process.   &#13;
&#13;
Appreciation is extended to the consultants who oversaw the entire strategy development process from &#13;
Apex Communications Ltd (ACL) led by Lawrence Gikaru, Brazille Musumba, and Mike Makuro with &#13;
the support of Mary Muinde. ACL facilitated the strategy development including the situation analysis. &#13;
&#13;
We would also like to express our gratitude to all those who reviewed the numerous drafts and those &#13;
who participated in the various consultative meetings including the stakeholders workshops. They &#13;
provided feedback and brought insights that have enriched the final product.  &#13;

1. Executive Summary &#13;
&#13;
The Water Act 2002 provides the framework for implementation of reforms aimed at enhancing water &#13;
resources management (WRM) and the provision of water supply and sanitation (WSS) services on a &#13;
sustainable basis. The reforms taking place are the single greatest change in the water sector in Kenya &#13;
since independence. These changes will have a farreaching impact on the way that WSS and WRM are &#13;
managed in this country. They also have the potential of generating resistance at a political and/or &#13;
social level if not communicated effectively.  &#13;
&#13;
This Communication Strategy provides the broad framework that guides communication on the &#13;
reforms and identifies the issues that need to be addressed to build understanding and generate &#13;
support for the reforms. These issues were identified through a situation analysis conducted at the &#13;
initial stages of the process of developing this strategy.   &#13;
&#13;
The issues include: &#13;
&#13;
     · Low levels of awareness and misconceptions of the reforms including fears that reform will &#13;
           result in increased cost of water, loss of revenue by local authorities, job losses among sector &#13;
           staff, poor people lacking access to water, and exploitation from the private sector.  &#13;
     · Most of the people who are aware of reforms are generally positive about them. &#13;
     · Relatively high consumer dissatisfaction with current performance of water and sewerage &#13;
           services. &#13;
     · Strong customer understanding of the need for responsible use of water and accountability for &#13;
           payment of water consumption. &#13;
     · Low conservation practices at community level, although the majority of the people believe that &#13;
           water conservation is important, and they recognize their role in managing water resources.  &#13;
     · Low understanding of water scarcity in Kenya, and the link between adequate water and &#13;
           sanitation and the health and wealth of the nation. &#13;
     · Poor overall coverage of water issues by the media. &#13;
&#13;
To effectively address these issues, this Communication Strategy seeks to: &#13;
&#13;
     · Increase awareness, improve knowledge and build support for water sector reforms among key &#13;
           stakeholders. &#13;
     · Promote positive water and sanitation management and conservation practices among all key &#13;
           stakeholders. &#13;
&#13;
To achieve the above objectives, the following strategies will be employed: &#13;
&#13;
     · Fasttracking internal communication activities to address staff concerns and build support for &#13;
           reforms within MWRMD. &#13;
     · Establishing public participation mechanisms that provide information sharing platforms to &#13;
           engage opinion leaders and implementation partners as information disseminators, and to feed &#13;
           back stakeholder views in a process of twoway communication.  &#13;
     · Developing and implementing a branded, phased multimedia communication program to &#13;
           increase knowledge on the reforms and motivate key stakeholders to adopt positive WSS and &#13;
           WRM practices.  &#13;
     · Leveraging the media as a program advocacy partner in the coverage of the reforms, and WSS &#13;
           and WRM issues.  &#13;
     · Strengthening the communications capacity of MWRMD and institutions under the Water Act &#13;
           2002 to implement the Communication Strategy effectively. &#13;

  2. Introduction &#13;
&#13;
  Background and Context &#13;
&#13;
  The Ministry of Water Resources Management and Development (MWRMD) is implementing reforms &#13;
  aimed at better management of water resources, improving access to water and sanitation services, &#13;
  enhancing accountability, and decentralizing provision of services. The legal framework guiding the &#13;
  implementation of these reforms is the Water Act 2002, which was enacted in March 2003.   &#13;
&#13;
  The key principles underlying the reforms are: &#13;
&#13;
         · Separation of policy, regulation and service provision within the water and sewerage sector. &#13;
         · Separation of water resource management from provision of water and sewerage services to &#13;
               avoid conflict of interest in resource allocation and management. &#13;
         · Devolution of responsibilities for water resource management and water service provision to &#13;
               the local level to create a sense of ownership and responsibility.  &#13;
         · Enhancing the sustainability of service provision. &#13;
&#13;
  Under the Water Act, new institutions have been set up and the roles of various actors redefined. Below &#13;
  is the institutional framework under the Act showing functions and broad roles of the various &#13;
  institutions at the national, regional and local levels.  &#13;

Communication Strategy for the Water Sector Reforms Programme &#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Communication Strategy Rationale  &#13;
&#13;
Reform programs succeed when they are well understood and supported by stakeholders. Such &#13;
programs are however often placed at risk when the institution steering the changes does not put in &#13;
place adequate mechanisms to secure political and social support amongst stakeholders. Such &#13;
mechanisms include adopting a strategic approach to communicating with key stakeholder and interest &#13;
groups. &#13;
&#13;
The implementation of the water sector reforms as provided for in the Water Act 2002 will involve &#13;
major changes in water resources management practices and provision of water services. These changes &#13;
have the potential to generate resistance from politicians and the general public. The discomfort &#13;
associated with privatization, negative media coverage, and apprehension regarding potential increases &#13;
in price and the transfer of public assets are all factors that have the potential to create opposition &#13;
against the reforms. &#13;
&#13;
Communication is required to build understanding and support for reforms because resistance to &#13;
reform is expensive. When there is resistance, reforms take much longer to implement or they may not &#13;
proceed as planned. In the worst scenario they may not succeed at all. Communication in a reform &#13;
period has to be strategic, intensive and consultative in nature to build understanding and minimize &#13;
resistance, as technical solutions alone cannot build the consensus that is required for reforms to &#13;
succeed. &#13;
&#13;
The water sector situation analysis indicates both a lack of awareness and misconceptions by various &#13;
stakeholders regarding the reforms. NGOs are particularly skeptical of reforms viewing them as an &#13;
abdication by Government in its role of providing an essential service. Consumers, on the other hand, &#13;
express concern about the implications of reform on their access to and the costs of water.  &#13;
&#13;
As most Kenyans do not clearly associate adequate water and sanitation with both indirect and direct &#13;
health and wealth creation, this indicates that their understanding of the importance of the need for a &#13;
more effective sector is low. Without the proper context for understanding why reforms are needed, &#13;
both misconceptions and support for the reforms will remain low. &#13;
&#13;
The general lack of awareness and uncertainty on the implications of the changes therefore necessitates &#13;
the use of strategic communication to: &#13;
&#13;
     · Raise the profile of water as an important component in the socioeconomic development of the &#13;
           country. &#13;
     · Develop the most appropriate and cost effective means of building understanding and &#13;
           generating support for the reforms among stakeholders.  &#13;
&#13;
The Communication Strategy addresses people's concerns, perceptions and motivations. It suggests &#13;
ways to communicate the reform vision and agenda, and sustain this throughout the reform process.  &#13;
&#13;
Finally, it should be noted that communication is a process that requires sustained efforts, and that &#13;
results take time to show. Expectations about the role of communication must be balanced, and based &#13;
on the understanding that communication is a facilitator that is tied to management decisions and &#13;
actions.  &#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Methodology Adopted for Communication Strategy Development &#13;
&#13;
The Water Sector Reforms Communication Strategy is the final product of a process that included a &#13;
situational analysis undertaken between January and March 2004, a stakeholder prioritization &#13;
workshop and several consultative meetings among key stakeholders. The findings and insight gleaned &#13;
from this process have guided the formulation of this Communication Strategy. &#13;
&#13;
The situational analysis1 included: &#13;
&#13;
     · Desk research, which involved reviewing several key documents to identify pertinent issues &#13;
           affecting the water sector and the key stakeholders in the sector. &#13;
     · A Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) that interviewed and collected data from a national &#13;
           representative sample of 3,000 Kenyan adults in all the eight provinces of the country. &#13;
     · Eighteen Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and 50 Indepth Interviews with a range of &#13;
           stakeholders. &#13;
     · A Media Content Analysis to discern the coverage patterns on water issues by national &#13;
           newspapers over a oneyear period. Through this exercise, media perceptions on water issues &#13;
           were identified. &#13;
&#13;
Throughout the process, a series of consultative meetings were also held with staff of the Ministry of &#13;
Water Resources and Management, and the Water Sector Reform Secretariat, GTZ and WSPAF. The &#13;
purpose was to review the research reports, and appraise the progress of the strategy development. A &#13;
oneday stakeholder prioritization workshop was held to share results of the formative assessment with &#13;
participants drawn from key sector institutions and familiarize them with the strategy development &#13;
process. The zero draft of the Communication Strategy was reviewed during a oneday workshop of a &#13;
working group from the MWRMD and related institutions.  &#13;
&#13;

3. Situation Analysis: Key Findings  &#13;
&#13;
Summary of Key Findings &#13;
&#13;
The key findings of this situation analysis are summarized below. A more detailed version of the &#13;
findings is in Annex 4 in the appendixes.  &#13;
&#13;
Water as a priority issue &#13;
&#13;
Water is considered a relatively high national priority by consumers. Although safe and clean water &#13;
was ranked as the fourth most important issue facing the country today (below poverty, unemployment &#13;
and HIV/AIDS), there is a strong likelihood that people may not directly link adequate water and &#13;
sanitation with health and economic development. &#13;
&#13;
Low levels of awareness and misconceptions of reforms among stakeholders &#13;
&#13;
Only 23 percent of consumers knew anything about reforms. The representatives from sector &#13;
organizations, NGOs and consumer groups had a higher awareness than consumers, but also displayed &#13;
several misconceptions about reforms and expressed a number of concerns. The overall mixed &#13;
perceptions include fears that reform will mean an increased cost of water, loss of revenue by local &#13;
authorities, job losses, poor people lacking access to water and exploitation from the private sector. &#13;
Encouragingly, those few who do know something about the reforms are generally positive.  &#13;
&#13;
Understanding of costs, consumptionrelated payments; price increase concerns &#13;
&#13;
Consumers seem to have a moderate understanding of the process of how water gets to the tap, and &#13;
what happens to sewage, and what type of costs are involved. There appears to be quite different ideas &#13;
among consumers about who should be responsible for costs, and this confusion should be clarified &#13;
during communication with stakeholder groups. For example, when asked who should pay for local or &#13;
household level water supply and sewerage services, 54 percent said Government, 27 percent said &#13;
consumers and 13 percent said costs should be shared. However, when asked who should finance &#13;
capital investments in large water schemes, 82 percent of consumers said that this cost should be shared &#13;
between Government, consumers and other partners.  &#13;
&#13;
The different ideas about who is responsible for meeting the costs of water and sanitation services is an &#13;
indicator that there could be resistance to the concept of fullcost pricing. However it is encouraging &#13;
that the idea of cost sharing was raised. Consumers understand that WSS have to be paid for and there &#13;
is a high understanding that payment should be related to the volume of consumption (support for &#13;
consumption related tariffs). Despite this encouraging level of understanding, over half of consumers &#13;
expressed fears that reforms will result in increased cost of water.  &#13;
&#13;
Institutional roles and private sector participation &#13;
&#13;
The majority of consumers (92 percent) believe that the government or local government has a role in &#13;
the provision of water and sewerage services. Some 50 percent feel that it should be a partial role, with &#13;
the other half wanting full Government control. When asked specifically what Government's role &#13;
should be the three main areas that were mentioned were regulation (54 percent), policy making (55 &#13;
percent) and supplying water services (47 percent). A significant finding was that 64 percent of &#13;
consumers want local authorities (through the Ministry of Local Government) to supply their water. &#13;
This is in direct contrast to a large majority of consumers (83 percent) feeling that there is a role for the &#13;
private sector although they have, mixed ideas about the nature of the role.  &#13;

&#13;
Dissatisfaction with WSS services &#13;
&#13;
There are relatively low levels of consumer satisfaction with the current performance of water and &#13;
sewerage services. About half of the respondents were not satisfied with water services while 61 &#13;
percent of the respondents were dissatisfied with the sewerage services.  &#13;
&#13;
Multiple organizations active in the WSS sector &#13;
&#13;
Desk research identified many organizations with multiple roles in the water sector. A number of these &#13;
organizations have fears and concerns over reforms while others are optimistic and supportive of the &#13;
reforms. NGOs representing the poor or working on human rights constitute the majority of &#13;
organizations that are apprehensive about reforms. They are skeptical about the reforms and perceive &#13;
them as an attempt by the government to abdicate its responsibility from providing an essential service.  &#13;
&#13;
Consumers see water as a right, and also understand key responsibilities &#13;
&#13;
There is a very strong consumer sense of entitlement to the right of a regular water supply (95 percent) &#13;
with easy access. When asked what their one biggest wish for the sector was, most consumers said tap &#13;
water for all households. There is also a very strong consumer understanding of the need for &#13;
responsible use of water (81 percent), and a high consumer sense of responsibility for payment for &#13;
water consumption (68 percent).  &#13;
&#13;
Mixed perceptions on water resource management issues &#13;
&#13;
The most worrying finding related to this topic was that there is a serious lack of understanding about &#13;
Kenya's water scarcity2 with 77 percent of respondents saying that Kenya has adequate water to meet &#13;
its needs. Although there were some provincial differences in this regard, it was surprising that the &#13;
overall misconception was so high, especially in places such as North Eastern Province where water &#13;
scarcity is highest.  &#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, the vast majority of respondents believe that the wise use of water is important (96 &#13;
percent), and they recognize their own role in managing the water resources. Unfortunately, this &#13;
awareness does not seem to be translating into conservation practices at community level as 75 percent &#13;
are not aware of any local water conservation programs.  &#13;
&#13;
There are mixed ideas about who should be in charge of water conservation at community level. It was &#13;
encouraging to see that the most popular vote was for communities to manage their own conservation &#13;
(45 percent), followed by Government (25 percent), and then individual consumers (12 percent). When &#13;
it came to who should be responsible for water resource or catchment management, 47 percent feel that &#13;
it should be Government, and 48 percent feel that communities should be responsible.  &#13;
&#13;
There is a strong understanding that conservation activities cost money (78 percent), but no &#13;
corresponding understanding of what factors will contribute to increasing the cost. There was &#13;
consensus among focus group respondents that efforts to create a positive attitude change among local &#13;
communities and water consumers on conservation need to be initiated.    &#13;
&#13;
Poor quality of media coverage &#13;
&#13;
Media coverage of changes in the WSS sector is relatively ad hoc, event driven and, in most cases, not &#13;
analytical. Interviews with editors of mainstream media organizations showed that they have a low &#13;
level of knowledge on the holistic nature of the water sector reforms. The government is the main &#13;
source of information on WSS issues reported in the media.  &#13;
&#13;
 &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2 The amount of water available per person per year in Kenya is about 640 m3 well below the universally accepted level of  &#13;
1000 m3 per person. &#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Media usage and trust among categories of consumers3 &#13;
&#13;
The most reliable recent national research data on media access is from the 2002 National HIV &#13;
Behavioural Surveillance Survey, conducted by the Ministry of Health, which used an interview sample &#13;
size of 15,000 people. The data shows that radio is by far the most used media, followed by television &#13;
and newspapers. The RAS of 3,000 consumers for this strategy corroborated that radio is the most used &#13;
channel overall, followed by television and newspapers. On the most trusted sources of information, &#13;
the overall ranking was radio (68 percent) followed by television (29 percent), newspapers (28 percent), &#13;
barazas (9 percent) and finally women's groups (2 percent).  &#13;
&#13;
Communication needs and preferences &#13;
&#13;
When asked how they would like to receive information on water sector issues, consumers order of &#13;
preference was radio, provincial administration, newspapers, television and the MWRMD. Sector &#13;
management and consumer representatives expressed the need for regular updates on the status of &#13;
reforms. They also asked for more information on the reasons, benefits and effects of reforms; effective &#13;
water management and conservation methods; water safety and waterborne diseases; pricing structures &#13;
and investments; opportunities for stakeholders and water resource availability in Kenya. In addition, &#13;
they expressed a willingness to support the establishment of water forums as vehicles for information &#13;
sharing and education, public participation and cooperative management. Consumer representatives &#13;
showed an interest in establishing consumer watchdog bodies. &#13;
&#13;
Low current communication capacity within the sector &#13;
&#13;
The current communications work in the WSS and WRM sector in Kenya is being done by the &#13;
MWRMD's Information Office. Focus is given to media relations, activities around peak periods such as &#13;
Water Day and a couple of other projects when funding is available. Communications is recognized by &#13;
MWRMD staff at provincial and district level as an essential component of reform and, despite the &#13;
current capacity problems, it appears that staff in several areas have taken the initiative of building &#13;
positive cooperative relations with staff of other related Ministries through development and &#13;
environmentaltype committees. Despite these existing activities, the current levels of WSS and WRM &#13;
sector communications in Kenya are inadequate given the complexity of the reform environment and &#13;
the difficulty of changing longterm behavior.  &#13;
&#13;
Implications of Research Findings for Communication Strategy   &#13;
&#13;
Build on the existing positive levels of understanding &#13;
&#13;
The findings indicate some positive knowledge and attitudes that can provide a good platform on &#13;
which MWRMD can build. The most important of these are that water is considered as a relatively high &#13;
national priority; those who know about the reforms are positive about them; most people feel that &#13;
there is a role for the private sector; and accept that conservation activities cost money; and that water is &#13;
charged for according to consumption. They have a high level of understanding of the need for &#13;
personal responsibility in terms of wise use and payment for consumption. This apparently healthy &#13;
sense of a conservationrelated ethic can be used as a good starting point on which to build &#13;
communication.  &#13;
&#13;
Correct misperceptions and close knowledge gaps &#13;
&#13;
The findings point out some fundamental problem areas that need to be addressed. These include the &#13;
low levels of knowledge about water scarcity in Kenya; reforms; cost structures and pricing issues; the &#13;
role of the private sector; and the exact meaning of wise WSS management for individual households, &#13;
communities and other stakeholders. &#13;

&#13;
Focus on key stakeholder concerns and fears &#13;
&#13;
Communication should be strategic in the sense that it should address the major stakeholder concerns &#13;
and fears that have been raised in the findings. For consumers, the big issues are cost increases, easy &#13;
access and regular supply.  &#13;
&#13;
Consumers fear that reforms will result in an increased cost of water, and this has to be tackled head on. &#13;
Perhaps the fact that the majority of consumers want local authorities to supply their water is related to &#13;
this fear, and this stated preference has to be addressed. For sectorrelated institutions, the concerns &#13;
centre around loss of revenue by local authorities, and loss of jobs among staff. These issues are already &#13;
being tackled by the MWRMD, and the strategy suggests ways of intensifying these efforts and &#13;
provides pragmatic ideas for a more systematic approach. &#13;
&#13;
When preparing messages, the strategy should take into account the very strong consumer sense of &#13;
entitlement about the right to easily accessible, safe and regular water supply. The greatest wish &#13;
expressed by the majority of respondents was the availability of tap water for all households. &#13;
&#13;
Tailor communications to the specific needs of each group &#13;
&#13;
The findings indicate that although there are some common information needs, there are also &#13;
significant differences in the concerns of the various stakeholder groups and consumer types. They &#13;
have different media usage and preference patterns, which need to be taken into account. When &#13;
planning communication activities it is important that all wording on communication outputs is written &#13;
in the briefest, clearest, simplest terms which avoids technical terminology as far as possible. Messages &#13;
should always cover: &#13;
&#13;
     · The nature and timing of reforms (what's happening?). &#13;
     · Why change is needed and the benefits that reform aims to bring (why should I care?). &#13;
     · What will change for that particular audience (how does it affect me?). &#13;
&#13;
Focus on NGOs and the media as opinion drivers &#13;
&#13;
The media content analysis that reviewed coverage over one year showed that coverage of reform was &#13;
relatively ad hoc, event driven, and lacked analysis. Since Government is the main source of &#13;
information on WSS issues reported in the media, the MWRMD and the WSRS have the opportunity of &#13;
influencing coverage of reforms if they can adopt a more proactive and systematic approach to &#13;
managing the media. &#13;
&#13;
The strategy therefore recommends a proactive approach for increasing knowledge on the holistic &#13;
nature of the water sector reforms among media managers and leveraging the media as a partner in the &#13;
coverage of reforms and the longerterm water management issues.  &#13;
&#13;
NGOs tend to be the most apprehensive about the effect of reforms, and they work with the media to &#13;
vocalise their concerns. A proactive outreach effort geared towards establishing and maintaining &#13;
dialogue with NGOs is therefore critical to the success of the communication efforts. &#13;
&#13;
Service improvement communications required &#13;
&#13;
The relatively high consumer dissatisfaction with current performance of water and sewerage services &#13;
has to be addressed. Payment for services is linked to satisfaction with the service. Since consumers &#13;
ultimately pay for all sector costs, it is important to proactively manage consumer or customer &#13;
expectations in this regard for the longterm sustainability of the sector. Customer focus will have to be &#13;
strengthened within sector institutions under the new Water Act, and the MWRMD and the service &#13;
providers, in particular, will have to work hard to demonstrate service improvements over time. &#13;

Communication Strategy for the Water Sector Reforms Programme &#13;
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Communication strategy to build on stakeholder suggestions &#13;
&#13;
Sector management and consumer representatives expressed the need for regular updates on the status &#13;
of reforms and for more information on a range of WSS topics. This suggests that the strategy should &#13;
include mechanisms that enhance information sharing. This could include a regular newsletter during &#13;
the first couple of years of reform, and permanent public participation structures such as the forums &#13;
suggested above.  There was also consensus among sector and consumer opinionleaders that effort to &#13;
create longterm positive attitude and behavior change among stakeholders for WSS conservation and &#13;
management needs to be initiated.   &#13;
&#13;
Responding to these types of demands for information and participation mechanisms is essential for the &#13;
strategy, as is responding to stakeholder requests on preferred means of communication. For example, &#13;
sector management prefers communication through official channels, while consumers generally prefer &#13;
to receive information on water sector issues via radio, provincial administration, newspapers and the &#13;
MWRMD in that order. A further breakdown shows that urban consumers prefer mass media sources, &#13;
and rural consumers prefer interpersonal sources. The most popular public meetings are those &#13;
organized by the provincial administration. &#13;
&#13;
Short versus longterm communication requirements &#13;
&#13;
Findings suggest that the communications program should be broken into two phases. Initially a short&#13;
term phase of reform communications should be used to build awareness and understanding on the &#13;
reforms and WSS issues. A second longer term phase should focus on behaviorchange communications &#13;
that promote positive water management attitudes and practices. &#13;
&#13;
Need to strengthen public participation mechanisms &#13;
&#13;
It is clear that information dissemination is important, but not sufficient for reforms to succeed. The &#13;
MWRMD needs to build or strengthen twoway consultation and participation structures such as &#13;
stakeholder forums, networks and committees. Since public participation and consultation is a &#13;
relationship building exercise that is key to good governance, it needs to become a permanent modus &#13;
operandi of the MWRMD. The idea of a National Water Information Centre has been raised, and it &#13;
would be important to have decentralized distribution mechanisms if this goes ahead. Official channels &#13;
for feedback could also be provided by strengthening the customer care function that has been started &#13;
in district water offices. &#13;
&#13;
Build communication capacity within the sector &#13;
&#13;
There appears to be a definite need to audit the communication capacity of all Water Act 2002 &#13;
institutions against the requirements for communication for the reform and postreform periods. &#13;
Capacity must then be built to close the identified gaps, which include raising implementation support &#13;
and financial resources from various partners.  &#13;

4. The Communication Strategy  &#13;
&#13;
The previously covered findings suggest that there is need for a Communication Strategy that focuses &#13;
on increasing knowledge, and building support for water sector reforms. The strategy should promote &#13;
behavior change on WSS management and water conservation, and address issues of fear and &#13;
uncertainty on the effect of the reforms among various stakeholders. The findings also provide a clear &#13;
indication on the appropriate messages and the audiences that this strategy needs to target. Based on &#13;
this analysis, the objectives of the strategy are given below. &#13;
&#13;
Overall Objectives of the Strategy &#13;
&#13;
     1. To increase awareness, improve knowledge and build support for water sector reforms among &#13;
           key stakeholders. &#13;
     2. To promote positive water and sanitation management and conservation practices among all &#13;
           key stakeholders.  &#13;
&#13;
The first objective is a shortterm objective focused specifically on reform communications and should &#13;
be accomplished within the first year. The second objective is a longerterm behavior change &#13;
communication objective which will target sustainable changes in specific behaviors. It will be started in &#13;
the first year, but activities are likely to get fully underway during the second and third years.   &#13;
&#13;
Specific Strategies &#13;
&#13;
These overall objectives will be achieved through the use of the following specific strategies:  &#13;
&#13;
     1. Internal communication to increase knowledge, build support for reforms and address new and &#13;
           existing concerns among staff of the MWRMD and institutions under the Water Act 2002. &#13;
     2. Public participation mechanisms to provide the MWRMD and other institutions under the &#13;
           Water Act 2002 with a platform to engage opinion leaders, implementation partners, and the &#13;
           general public. &#13;
     3. A phased and branded multimedia communication program to increase knowledge on the &#13;
           reforms and to motivate consumers to adopt positive WSS and WRM practices. &#13;
     4. Media advocacy to promote accurate and analytical coverage of reforms, and WSS and WRM &#13;
           issues. &#13;
     5. Capacity strengthening of MWRMD and institutions under the Water Act 2002 to implement &#13;
           the WSR Communication Strategy and longerterm behavior change programs. &#13;
&#13;
Each specific strategy is briefly elaborated on below. &#13;
&#13;
Internal communication &#13;
&#13;
Internal communication within institutions, under the Water Act 2002, will seek to build staff support &#13;
for reforms by increasing knowledge on the reforms, building a strong case for why reforms are &#13;
needed, and demonstrating the benefits of reform for both themselves and the nation as a whole.  &#13;
&#13;
Periods of transformation like this reform process require a significant increase in the intensity of &#13;
existing levels of communication as well as a proactive management of staff anxiety levels and &#13;
expectations. However, it is essential to understand that the role of communication will be facilitative &#13;
and the messages related to employment uncertainties will depend on the human resource &#13;
management decisions made and implemented by MWRMD and Water Act 2002 institutions. Internal &#13;
communications will need to work in close cooperation with human resources and labour relations' &#13;
leadership to be effective. The communications should be led from the top and implementation is &#13;
recommended using the following methods.  &#13;
&#13;

Communication Strategy for the Water Sector Reforms Programme &#13;
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     · Reinforcing existing formal communication structures with a special reform `team briefing &#13;
           system' to help line management communicate to their staff. This system would aid build line &#13;
           management commitment to the messages and, if properly implemented, ensure that key &#13;
           messages are cascaded down through the hierarchy of the organizations.  &#13;
      · Facilitating interaction with staff, particularly to address sensitive issues such as fears about job &#13;
           losses. &#13;
     · Arranging special events for staff to inform, celebrate and motivate staff about reform issues &#13;
           and the launch of new initiatives. In a reform period, the level of communication is advised to &#13;
           be significantly higher than usual, and these events are intended to highlight the importance of &#13;
           the issues. They could include using types of communication that are not traditionally used in &#13;
           the workplace. Examples are the use of choirs, theatre groups and symbolic activities such as &#13;
           pledges.  &#13;
     · Producing a quarterly internal newsletter that is personalized from the Minister.  &#13;
&#13;
Establishing public participation mechanisms  &#13;
&#13;
Opinion leaders, as influencers within their stakeholder communities, can play a vital and costeffective &#13;
role as an interpersonal way of reinforcing the messages sent out through mass media channels. Water &#13;
Act 2002 institutions should engage these opinion leaders as channels for twoway communications. &#13;
There are also several organizations that would be ideal implementation partners for the reform phase &#13;
and longerterm communication. Twoway communication mechanisms for these relationships are &#13;
needed.  &#13;
&#13;
Public participation is described as an essential component within the Water Act 2002. However the &#13;
consultation requirements of the Act are limited, and a broader and ongoing use of public participation &#13;
mechanisms are a cornerstone of this strategy. Informationsharing and consultation forums will create &#13;
the opportunity for opinion leaders to become informed partners that both disseminate information and &#13;
receive feedback from stakeholder groups. The strategy proposes establishing WSS and WRM forums &#13;
as vehicles for ongoing twoway communication with consumer representatives and sector &#13;
management as an essential component for addressing and solving WSS issues through participatory &#13;
processes. &#13;
&#13;
In the first year, these WSS and WRM forums will be established and used as vehicles for reform &#13;
communication. In the second and third years, the content focus would change to the longerterm &#13;
behavioral change communication. The longterm plan will be to establish WSS and WRM forums &#13;
down to the district and constituency level under the facilitation of the Water Act 2002 institutions. It &#13;
would start with Water Service Boards in each region.  &#13;
&#13;
Water Forums at the local level could culminate in a high profile National WSS Forum held to coincide &#13;
with the annual World Water Day. This strategy recommends that the MWRMD establish a broader &#13;
Water Week to raise the profile of water issues in Kenya. An award that will recognize excellence in &#13;
leadership on WSS and WRM should be created and awarded at local, regional and national level &#13;
during this annual water week. &#13;
&#13;
Media advocacy &#13;
&#13;
The media will be leveraged as a strategic partner through a proactive media relations program and a &#13;
media award scheme. Under this strategy, the media will also be used as one of the channels for &#13;
communicating the reforms to the public. Water Act 2002 institutions will proactively engage media &#13;
organizations by providing them with information and tools to facilitate accurate and analytical &#13;
coverage of the reforms and water issues.  &#13;

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ &#13;
                                                                                                                                                          &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A media award scheme to motivate media publishers and individual journalists to cover reforms &#13;
comprehensively, will be one of the key activities under this strategy. Media training workshops at the &#13;
national and regional level will be designed to prepare journalists to cover water issues more &#13;
analytically and to participate in the award program. The award scheme will be designed so as to &#13;
strategically focus reporting on specific themes or activities tied to the reforms or WSSS and WRM &#13;
issues over a limited time period. Activities to support the media award scheme will include &#13;
establishing collaborative mechanisms with media bodies and developing guidelines on adjudication. &#13;
Different award categories will be established for individual journalists and participating media houses. &#13;
&#13;
Branded, phased multimedia and multichannel communication campaign &#13;
&#13;
The multimedia communication program campaign will be carried out in two phases: &#13;
&#13;
Phase 1 will be a public information campaign providing general information on the reforms for the first &#13;
year. This phase will aim at building a critical mass of people within the general population who are &#13;
knowledgeable about the reforms to provide a conducive environment for their implementation. The &#13;
campaign will be delivered through mutually reinforcing mass media to build awareness and increase &#13;
knowledge on the ongoing reforms and their benefits throughout the country. The mass media &#13;
campaign will be complemented by public participation mechanisms that engage opinion leaders to &#13;
reinforce the key messages at the local level through various community forums.  &#13;
&#13;
Momentum for the public information campaign will be built through a highprofile launch of the &#13;
National Water Forum. Regional Water Service Boards will link the launch of water forums at the &#13;
regional level with activities specific to their region. &#13;
&#13;
Phase 2 will focus on motivating consumers to adopt positive water and sanitation management &#13;
practices. The thematic communication programs of the second phase will be selected based on &#13;
progress of reforms and the emerging WSS service and WRM issues identified over the first year. A &#13;
behavior change approach should be followed that is integrated with all communication efforts. Rather &#13;
than focus on the use of mass media as a vehicle, this phase should focus on making use of community&#13;
based social, religious, civic and political organizations, individuals and networks in Kenyan society as &#13;
channels and influencers to communicate with people `facetoface'. Examples would be speaking &#13;
through women's groups, barazas and church groups. A radio entertainmenteducational serial drama &#13;
linked to community level activities is also recommended as a central activity for this phase.   &#13;
&#13;
For Phase 2, the Kenya school system could be a great ally in terms of educating each generation of &#13;
children about water and sanitation issues, through building them into the syllabus (which may take a &#13;
few years to establish) as well as into the extracurricular `clubs'. Schools are also an integral part of the &#13;
community for adult education and project demonstration purposes (e.g. rainwater harvesting.) &#13;
&#13;
Capacity strengthening to implement the Communication Strategy &#13;
&#13;
Water Act 2002 institutions will require capacity strengthening to implement this Communication &#13;
Strategy. It is recommended that institutions should hire appropriately qualified communication staff &#13;
that develop and implement WSS and WRM communication strategies. Key officials from each &#13;
institution should be trained on how to capitalize on the research findings and approaches proposed &#13;
within this Communication Strategy. Technical assistance for the new institutions to build their &#13;
capacity to develop and implement communication plans appropriate to their mandates will need to be &#13;
provided.   &#13;
&#13;
Capacity and resources from other organizations will be required and in line with a more partnership&#13;
oriented approach to communications, the MWRMD could benefit by establishing a representative &#13;
forum of communication staff from other water sector organizations. A communication function within &#13;

the WSRS and MWRMD specifically to manage the implementation of this Communication Strategy &#13;

recommended to avoid duplication of activities, coordinate messages and maximize communications &#13;
impact. &#13;

Communication Strategy matrix &#13;
&#13;
The Communication Strategy matrix summarizes the key aspects of each specific strategy. It integrates &#13;
all aspects of the strategy indicating the logical link between the audience, key message themes, &#13;
methodology, channels and tools, expected outcome and implementing partners. Key message themes &#13;
are based on the objective for communication to each audience and the findings from the situation &#13;
analysis. The channels recommended are based on the data covering media usage in Kenya4. The &#13;
strategy matches audiences with specific channels depending on accessibility of channel to the specific &#13;
audience.  &#13;

5. Strategy Implementation: General Recommendations &#13;
&#13;
A phasedin approach will be adopted when implementing this strategy over a period of three years. &#13;
The first phase of the program will be on reform communication and WSRS will be responsible for &#13;
coordinating the implementation of this phase. The longterm behavioral change communication on &#13;
WSS and WRM issues will be phasedin towards the end of the first year, and the institutions under the &#13;
Water Act 2002 will be responsible for implementing different components of the strategy from this &#13;
point onwards. Activities will be implemented at three interlinked levels: national, regional and local. &#13;
Implementation will be coordinated through a sector Communication Coordinating Committee to &#13;
leverage resources and to maintain coherence of communication activities among implementing &#13;
institutions at the three levels. &#13;
&#13;
Strategy Implementation Recommendations &#13;
&#13;
Below are general recommendations on key strategy implementation areas: &#13;
&#13;
Establishing a communication function to manage implementation of strategy &#13;
&#13;
Implementation of this strategy will require focused effort and it is recommended that the &#13;
WSRS/MWRMD establish a communication post to specifically manage the implementation of this &#13;
strategy. MWRMD together with its collaborating partners will work out the modalities of this function.  &#13;
&#13;
Delivering communication from a branded platform &#13;
&#13;
A theme, logo and slogan will be developed at the beginning of the implementation of this strategy to &#13;
provide a branded platform for all communication materials. This will enhance coherence of messages &#13;
and create synergy across the different communication activities.  &#13;
&#13;
Developing and producing communication materials &#13;
&#13;
All key materials produced will require pretesting among intended audiences prior to production. &#13;
Development of materials will be competitively contracted out to an advertising agency, which will be &#13;
responsible for developing the theme and longterm identity of the communication program. The &#13;
`Communication Coordinating Committee' will participate in the development of key creative materials &#13;
to ensure their technical correctness and appropriateness.  &#13;
&#13;
Implementing a branded and phased public communication program &#13;
&#13;
The campaign will be implemented through phased but carefully linked streams over the three years. &#13;
The first phase will be a national public information campaign delivered through mutually reinforcing &#13;
mass media. Momentum for the campaign will be built through a high profile launch of the National &#13;
Water Forum. Regional Water Service Boards will link the launches of local Water Forums with issues &#13;
specific to their regions. The second phase will consist of thematic communication programs focused on &#13;
key behavioral areas which impact on WSS service and WRM issues. It is probable that communication &#13;
during the second phase will primarily rely on communitybased media and mass media will only be &#13;
used for strategic communication support during the launches.  &#13;
&#13;
Using media placement &#13;
&#13;
A media plan for the public service advertising will be based on the most recent media usage data. The &#13;
agency contracted to coordinate media placement should have the capacity to negotiate for bonus spots &#13;
among media houses, as this is a sociocivic communication program (not for commercial gain).  &#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Disseminating information materials &#13;
&#13;
Materials will be disseminated5 through a demanddriven network to ensure that they are distributed &#13;
efficiently and used effectively at community level.  &#13;
&#13;
Introducing a media award scheme &#13;
&#13;
The media award scheme activities will be linked to the public information campaign to generate the &#13;
necessary and the right media content early in the implementation of the Communication Strategy.  &#13;
&#13;
Implementing leadership awards &#13;
&#13;
The leadership awards will be planned to be presented during the annual World Water Day in March. &#13;
The leadup to the awards will be promoted to generate public interest in water conservation and &#13;
management, and to magnify good water resource management and conservation practices.  &#13;
Opportunities for participation of the private sector and development partners will be created at the &#13;
national, regional and local level.  &#13;
&#13;
Conditions for Successful Implementation &#13;
&#13;
For this strategy to succeed, all Water Act 2002 institutions have to buy in to the importance and value &#13;
of communications, and of playing their part in the implementation of this strategy. &#13;
&#13;
Another rather obvious criterion for success is that adequate financial resources are required to be &#13;
committed for the implementation of this strategy. &#13;
&#13;
The capacity to implement this strategy within Water Act 2002 institutions has to be strengthened. &#13;
Dedicated communications staff need to be hired, and the recommendation is for at least one post to be &#13;
created initially per Water Act 2002 institution. These staff would have to be appropriately skilled, and &#13;
then would require specific training on the sector reforms, and WRM and WSS issues. This will take &#13;
some time, and capacity can be boosted in the immediate term by using a private sector &#13;
communications firm to help manage aspects of implementation. Making use of NGOs who operate at &#13;
`grassroots' level as implementation allies would also be a strong recommendation. &#13;
&#13;
Experience in the WSS sector worldwide has shown that, generally consumers are mainly concerned &#13;
with the issues that affect their daily lives directly. These are access, regular supply and affordability. &#13;
Most people do not care who supplies them as long as the service and the price are at acceptable levels. &#13;
This means that it is important that the benefits of reform are communicated to people, rather than a &#13;
lot of unnecessary detail about reform that they do not care about. &#13;
&#13;
In terms of this messaging, the benefits are mostly going to be about service delivery improvements. &#13;
The question of cost will also have to be addressed. It will be very important however, not to &#13;
overpromise on service delivery. For some people, it will take years before they personally benefit &#13;
from service delivery improvements and this has to be made clear upfront. It has to be recognised that &#13;
communications can only be as good as the efforts it supports on the ground. The `talk' and the `action' &#13;
of successful reform developments and service delivery improvements have to be in harmony. It would &#13;
be seriously counterproductive to overpromise as this would risk the credibility of the reforms and &#13;
jeopardize consumer support. The proactive management of consumer expectations will be critical for &#13;
the successful implementation of this strategy and for the overall reform process. &#13;
&#13;

5 Dissemination refers to distribution of materials together with an explanation of who the intended audiences are and where they &#13;
should be used, handed out or displayed. &#13;

6. Monitoring and Evaluation Framework  &#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) will be essential to objectively establish progress towards the &#13;
achievements of the objectives of this Communication Strategy and in tracking the performance of the &#13;
program. The key aspects of the M&amp;E framework for this program include: &#13;
&#13;
      · Monitoring of the program activities as they happen. &#13;
      · Assessing the outcomes and impact of the program at regular intervals. &#13;
&#13;
Monitoring of the program performance  &#13;
&#13;
Monitoring of the performance of this program will involve tracking and assessing the specific outputs &#13;
of the communication activities. A mechanism for collecting data and reporting on the specific output &#13;
indicators for each program activity should be developed and implemented. The monitoring of activity &#13;
outputs are likely to be the responsibility of the WSRS/ MWRMD.  &#13;
&#13;
Assessing the outcomes and impact of the communication program &#13;
&#13;
The overall outcome indicators will form the basis for assessing the interim and longterm impact of the &#13;
communication program. This level of assessment should be conducted by independent research &#13;
organizations. The key methodology for assessing outcomes will be stakeholder surveys such as annual &#13;
surveys to assess changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviors. &#13;
&#13;
The expected outcomes for the first and second objectives are given below.  &#13;
&#13;
Objective 1: To increase awareness, knowledge and support for water sector reform (Year 1):   &#13;
&#13;
     · Reduced staff concerns about institutional changes and the perceived threat of job losses. &#13;
     · Increased levels of awareness of reforms.  &#13;
     · Increased quality of knowledge of reforms. &#13;
     · Decreased misconceptions on key issues in WSR. &#13;
     · Increased accuracy and analytical nature of media coverage of water issue. &#13;
     · Established and functional public participation mechanisms.  &#13;
&#13;
Objective 2: To promote positive water and sanitation management practices (Years 1  3): &#13;
&#13;
     · Increased public interest levels in WSSS and WRM issues. &#13;
     · Increased consumer knowledge about their rights and responsibilities. &#13;
     · Increased communications capacity within sector institutions as measured by increased &#13;
           resources and implementation of communication plans. &#13;
     · Increased consensus building and addressing of stakeholder concerns through public &#13;
           participation mechanisms. &#13;
     · Increased knowledge of the link between water and sanitation and wealth creation. &#13;
     · Increased number of community and civil society initiatives including forums, consumer &#13;
           representative bodies and conservation projects. &#13;
&#13;
A monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) specialist should be contracted to carry out this level of impact &#13;
assessment. The scope of work for the M&amp;E specialist would include: &#13;
&#13;
     · Reviewing and finalizing the outcome indicators  &#13;
      · Designing a comprehensive M&amp;E plan and methodology relevant to the outcome indicators &#13;
      · Designing a comprehensive strategy for assessing the impact of the Communication Strategy &#13;
           among all stakeholders &#13;
     · Conducting the outcome and impact assessment surveys at specified and agreed timeframes. &#13;
     · Analyzing the data, preparing reports and disseminating the survey findings to key &#13;
           stakeholders. &#13;

&#13;
     · Giving recommendations on the program improvement. &#13;
&#13;
The M&amp;E specialist will work closely with the WSRS, MWRMD and other stakeholders in &#13;
implementing the above tasks. &#13;
&#13;
Knowledge Management  &#13;
&#13;
It is important that key information, lessons learned and tacit knowledge gained in the process of &#13;
developing and implementing the Communication Strategy are recorded in a systematic way and &#13;
shared with partner organizations so that their value is not lost. &#13;
&#13;
Initially the role of the Knowledge Management component for communication activities within the &#13;
sector would be to:  &#13;
&#13;
     · Develop and implement a contacts database that includes the details of all key stakeholders that &#13;
           may need to be contacted in the future. This could use simple and inexpensive software such as &#13;
           the Microsoft ACCESS package, and could be maintained inhouse. &#13;
     · Prepare and present quarterly reports on communication activities to the most senior &#13;
           management committee within MWRMD. This should help ensure that the leadership remain &#13;
           abreast of strategy implementation and provide direction on future efforts.  &#13;
&#13;
Information and experience could be shared through:  &#13;
&#13;
     · The Communication Coordination Committee (and any other WSS communication forum &#13;
           groups that are formed) will share information and keep the knowledge alive and growing over &#13;
           time.  &#13;
     · Regular reports released to the media for dissemination to the public.  &#13;

&#13;
7. Approaches for Resource Mobilization  &#13;
&#13;
Successful implementation of this strategy will partly depend on the effective mobilization of the &#13;
required resources. The key resource mobilization strategies that would be considered for purposes of &#13;
implementing this strategy are outlined below.  &#13;
&#13;
Mainstreaming Communication Strategy in programs of other stakeholders &#13;
&#13;
The new water institutions, other government ministries, NGOs and water service providers would be &#13;
encouraged to integrate components of this strategy into their operations. These institutions will be &#13;
requested to communicate key messages on the water sector reforms during the implementation of &#13;
their activities. The program would develop userfriendly information materials to facilitate the &#13;
mainstreaming process. The mainstreaming approach will be a cost effective way of implementing the &#13;
communication activities.  &#13;
&#13;
Leveraging private sector participation in communicating water issues &#13;
&#13;
This can be achieved through encouraging the private sector organizations to include messages on &#13;
water in their communication and marketing programs. Private sector firms to be specifically targeted &#13;
are those involved in: &#13;
&#13;
     · Water service provision. &#13;
     · Water purification and treatment. &#13;
     · Water harvesting and storage. &#13;
     · Water technology including drilling. &#13;
     · Media organizations. &#13;
&#13;
Forging creative cosponsorships with nonwater sector organizations &#13;
&#13;
Organizations targeted would be those that have active marketing programs focused on the same &#13;
audiences that MWRMD wants to reach.  &#13;
&#13;
Developing partnership with organizations with wide distribution networks &#13;
&#13;
Organizations with large networks (national and regional) would be used for the dissemination of &#13;
information materials on water issues in a cost effective manner. Such organizations include &#13;
educational institutions, religious bodies, supermarket chains and transport companies. Most of these &#13;
organizations have the capacity to reach a large number of people within a short period of time. &#13;
Therefore, this mode of information dissemination is suitable for public awareness campaigns.  &#13;
&#13;
Developing funding proposals that will match components of the strategy to the interests of &#13;
particular funding agencies &#13;
&#13;
An example is that the conservation leadership awards may be of interest to bodies supporting &#13;
conservation whereas media awards would be of interest to foundations supporting capacity building &#13;
in the media industry.  &#13;
&#13;
Approaching development partners active in the water sector &#13;
&#13;
There are a range of international development agencies that are already active in the water sector in &#13;
Kenya such as GTZ, SIDA, the World Bank, UN organizations such as UNICEF and UN Habitat, and &#13;
several others. It would also be worth approaching organizations who are running other wellfunded &#13;
sociocivic and health campaigns such as those funded by the Global Fund for HIV/ AIDS, TB and &#13;
malaria. The link between positive water and sanitation practices and disease prevention and patient &#13;
treatment could be a natural entry point for collaboration. &#13;

&#13;
Tapping into the social responsibility programs of corporate companies &#13;
&#13;
Several private sector organizations are increasingly recognizing the value that participating in social &#13;
responsibility has to the success of their businesses. Therefore, as a resource mobilization strategy, these &#13;
companies would be approached to consider supporting water resources management and &#13;
conservation as part of their social responsibility programs. This strategy should focus on good water &#13;
resources management practices and can be linked to the leadership award.  &#13;

Budget Notes &#13;
&#13;
     1. This is an indicative budget that covers critical elements only. An indicative budget for a `full &#13;
           fledged' implementation plan is in Annex 1. The media plan in this budget is cut down (e.g. it &#13;
           excludes the use of TV as a medium) and as a result it will take longer to achieve desirable &#13;
           levels of awareness amongst the Kenyan population. &#13;
&#13;
     2. Budget for material production includes cost of design and is based on actual quotations from &#13;

     3. Media placement costs are based on current prices from media houses. The budget is based on &#13;
           a media plan developed using 2004 first quarter media research data from Steadman Research &#13;
           and Research International.  The media plan is based on the most cost effective means of &#13;
           attaining a national reach in the shortest time possible. The media plan and its rationale is &#13;
           available on request. &#13;
&#13;
     4. Estimates for items such as dissemination meetings, workshops and seminars are based on a &#13;
           consolidated unit cost. &#13;
&#13;
     5. Budget for the media plan in the fullyfledged implementation budget (Annex 1) is based on &#13;
           the most current media usage research data that can attain a national reach of 60% percent for &#13;
           TV and 69 percent for radio. The reach is generated using the media planning software, Telmar, &#13;
           and is based on media usage data synthesised from media diaries from Steadman Research and &#13;
           Research International (EA) for Quarter 1 in 2004. Optimum reach in any given media plan is &#13;
           achieved by increasing channel choices. Dropping one medium decreases reach of the &#13;
           communication efforts. Based on evaluations of past campaigns (utilizing multiple media with &#13;
           optimum reach) the estimate is that the fully fledged plan (costing KSH 58,446,829 for the first &#13;
           year) will achieve 75% awareness levels in Kenya within six months. The budget for the critical &#13;
           elements only (for KSH 25,970,087) excludes TV, but this may not significantly affect reach as &#13;
           radio is still the most widely used medium in the country. However, it would take significantly &#13;
           longer to build the optimum awareness with a reduced budget (covering critical elements only). &#13;

                 Terms of Reference for the Development of a Communications Strategy &#13;
&#13;
Background  &#13;
&#13;
The Water Act 2002 was recently enacted into law by the Kenya Parliament and received &#13;
Presidential Assent on October 17, 2002. It now provides legislation governing the water sector in &#13;
Kenya. The Act provides legislation intended to enable the realization of stated policy objectives &#13;
contained in the National Policy on Water Resources Management and Development published &#13;
by Government as Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1999. The Act provides for establishment of new &#13;
institutions as follows: &#13;
&#13;
     I.    Water Resources Management Authority (WRMA) to be responsible for regulation of &#13;
           Water Resources Management issues such as Water allocation, source protection and &#13;
           conservation, water quality management and pollution control, and International Waters. &#13;
           Catchment Area Advisory Committees (CAACs) shall be appointed for the respective &#13;
           Catchment areas to advice on water resources conservation, use and apportionment; the &#13;
           grant adjustment, cancellation or variation of any permit etc. &#13;
&#13;
     II.   Water Services Regulatory Board (WSRB) to be responsible for regulation of water and &#13;
           sewerage services provision including issuing licenses, determining service standards, &#13;
           providing a mechanism for handling complaints, provide tariff guidelines etc. &#13;
&#13;
     III.  Water Services Boards (WSBs) to be licensed by the WSRB and be responsible for the &#13;
           efficient and economical provision of water services (defined to mean any service of or &#13;
           incidental to the supply of water or the provision of sewerage) authorized by the license. The &#13;
           water services authorized by the license shall be provided by an Agent or Agents of the &#13;
           WSB designated as Water Services Providers (WSPs), except in circumstances where the &#13;
           WSRB is satisfied that the procurement of such Agent is not possible or that the provision &#13;
           of services by an Agent is not practicable. The WSPs may comprise private sector &#13;
           operators, communities, Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), or companies &#13;
           established by Local Authorities. &#13;
&#13;
     IV.  The Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF) whose objective is to assist in financing the &#13;
           provision of water services to areas without adequate water services. The WSTF shall be &#13;
           managed by Trustees appointed and holding office under a Trust Deed to be drawn up &#13;
           by the Minister &#13;
&#13;
     V.   The Water Appeal Board (WAB) that shall be responsible for the determination of appeals &#13;
           and disputes. The judgment of WAB shall be final `Provided that on a matter of law, an &#13;
           appeal shall lie to the High Court'. &#13;
&#13;
The Department of Water, under the Director of Water, shall continue in existence to assist the &#13;
Minister in discharge of duties as provided for in the Water Act 2002. &#13;
&#13;
To implement the above provisions contained in the Water Act 2002 major reforms have to be &#13;
undertaken in the way the sector is presently administered. As part of these governance &amp; &#13;
institutional reform imperatives, there are a range of related environmental resource and service &#13;
management issues that require positive attitude and behavior change. In order to do this, &#13;
&#13;

 &#13;
&#13;
support from all stakeholders is required. It is therefore imperative to update and involve the &#13;
public and other stakeholders the new developments.  &#13;
&#13;
There is a need to lift the profile of what has traditionally been lowprofile communications on &#13;
national water issues, and this should be done by building on the platform of the National Water &#13;
Campaign that was launched in March 2002. &#13;
&#13;
A Water Sector Reforms Secretariat (WSRS) has been established to be responsible for all &#13;
transitional arrangements relating to the implementation of the new sector legislation and has &#13;
developed a practical transition plan. The secretariat reports to the Water Sector Reforms Steering &#13;
Committee. &#13;
&#13;
Objective &#13;
&#13;
The objective of hiring a Consultant to develop a Reform Communications Strategy is for the &#13;
WSRS to obtain expert advice on the most appropriate and effective means of reaching and &#13;
engaging stakeholders through, but not limited to: processes involving consultation and &#13;
communication in order to disseminate information, build consensus and encourage &#13;
sustainability of the reforms among stakeholders &#13;
&#13;
Services to Be Rendered                         &#13;
&#13;
The Consultant shall be responsible for designing customized programs and strategies that are &#13;
culturally sensitive, acceptable and context specific for effective dissemination of information on &#13;
water sector reforms to all stakeholders.  This is considered to be a necessary prerequisite in the &#13;
implementation of water sector reforms whose success shall enable realization of the national &#13;
policy objectives for the sector and lead to the achievement of targets for improved access to &#13;
water and sanitation services contained in the National Poverty Eradication Plan (19992015) and &#13;
the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (20012004).  &#13;
&#13;
The Consultant will also design a two to three year Reform Communication Program and &#13;
propose a suitable framework for its implementation. The Program should be designed to &#13;
mobilize support among key players for the reform process and ensure, through the process of &#13;
communication and consultation that the stakeholders are prepared for changes that shall occur &#13;
as a result of sector reforms. &#13;
&#13;
Due to the urgent recognized need for dissemination of reform information to the various &#13;
segments of the public in general and the people in the sector in particular, the consultant shall be &#13;
required to propose THEMATIC MESSAGES that shall also highlight reforms, and also propose &#13;
how the messages will be disseminated.  &#13;
&#13;
In producing the strategy for a Reform Communication Program, the consultant will:  &#13;
&#13;
     · Identify issues and define goals that the Reform Communication Strategy and Program is &#13;
           to achieve with respect to Integrated Water Resources Management and Water Supply &#13;
           and Sanitation Services and other reforms envisaged through the Water Act 2002 and &#13;
           detailed in the National water sector strategies. &#13;
     · Determine the various levels and types of stakeholders that must be addressed in the &#13;
           strategy. Segment the stakeholder audiences into classified groups useful for strategic &#13;
           purposes. A brief report outlining the relationship history with each stakeholder group &#13;
           including analysis of knowledge, attitudes and practices on water sector issues generally &#13;
           and water sector reforms in particular, shall be produced to document the segmentation &#13;
           exercise. Understanding the dynamics, needs, values and characteristics of each group is &#13;
           essential to producing an appropriate strategy. &#13;

     ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          · Outline the content issues that should be dealt with for each segmented stakeholder &#13;
                group, and the key messages to be communicated. &#13;
          · Identify and investigate other similar sociocivic, environmental resource or `social &#13;
                marketing' advocacy campaigns that have successfully changed attitudes and behaviors &#13;
                in Kenya to establish the Key Success Factors and other learning's. E.g. the national &#13;
                campaigns for HIV/AIDS, soil erosion and family planning. Utilize the key success factors &#13;
                and lessons to add value to the Reform Communications Strategy. &#13;
          · Make proposals for the most appropriate communication channels, mechanisms and &#13;
                messages for each segmented stakeholder group. Design programs and develop &#13;
                strategies to reach each level of stakeholders which shall include but not be limited to the &#13;
                use of `public participation' mechanisms such as Forums/Fora, and tools &amp; channels such &#13;
                as: Poster Campaigns, Newspaper Insertions, Newsletters, Television Documentaries, &#13;
                Radio Programmes, Internet based information and advertising etc.  The consultant shall &#13;
                prepare an outline of the proposed tools (posters, newspaper insertions, documentaries &#13;
                etc) and messages with respect to the stakeholder segments identified and make &#13;
                proposals for a Media Management Program. &#13;
          · Design an appropriate two to three year Reform Communications program including a &#13;
                format for measuring, monitoring and evaluation. The Program should have clear &#13;
                indicators of achievement based on quantity, quality and time, and means of verification &#13;
                that confirm the achievements as far as the process, impact and outcome is concerned. &#13;
          · Consult with players within the water sector who are running communications related &#13;
                programs.  &#13;
          · Identify initial and longerterm research studies that need to be conducted (e.g. &#13;
                `Knowledge, Attitude and Practice' (KAP) studies, `Climate &amp; Attitude' studies, and &#13;
                audits. Initial research studies to be conducted. &#13;
          · As a dual reporting and consulting function, the consultant may be called upon to mount &#13;
                workshops and seminars to discuss or disseminate findings and make the necessary &#13;
                presentations to the Ministry and other stakeholders. &#13;

     Methodology &#13;
&#13;
     The development of the Reform Communication Strategy &amp; Program is proposed to be both a &#13;
     consultative and communication process to ensure that all identified stakeholders are reached &#13;
     and involved in order to build consensus and understanding of the pertinent issues among all &#13;
     stakeholders. The mechanisms developed must be customized to target a specific segment of &#13;

stakeholders, tailored to a particular issue, and reflect political, economic, legal, environmental, &#13;
technological and social realities.  &#13;
&#13;
Expected Outputs &#13;
&#13;
The expected outputs of this undertaking shall be clear, practical, acceptable and effective &#13;
strategies that are integrated into one overall strategy document with a Reform Communication &#13;
Program to ensure a wider group of stakeholders in the sector are consulted, involved and &#13;
receive the correct information on sector reforms being implemented with respect to the revised &#13;
sector legislation contained in the Water Act 2002. This communication strategy detail shall &#13;
include: &#13;
&#13;
     · An Initial Proposals Report for immediate use containing THEMATIC MESSAGES &#13;
     · Programmes or a mix of programs that target each category of identified stakeholders &#13;
           and take into account local needs, cultural, political and social realities in Kenya designed &#13;
           and implemented. &#13;
     · Report on stakeholder segmentation processes and outcomes, which shall include &#13;
           stakeholder knowledge, attitudes and practices on water, sector issues generally and &#13;
           water reform in particular. &#13;
     · Proposals for a specific Internal Communication Program for all Ministry staff as a &#13;
           component of the overall Reform Communications Program. &#13;
     · Proposals for building the capacity of the Communications function within the Ministry &#13;
           of Water Resources Management and Development ­ for the purposes of the Reform &#13;
           Communication Program and more longterm. &#13;
     · A `Communications Program Implementation Plan' that gives a broad framework for &#13;
           how the program would roll out in phases over a period of twothree years.  &#13;
     · Proposals for a `Knowledge Management' component, which will help ensure that &#13;
           important information is recorded in a systematic way so that this is not lost due to staff &#13;
           turnover problems, and can be used to add value to other projects, run by the Ministry &#13;
           and other stakeholders. &#13;
     · Proposals for a `peer review system' for the Reform Communication Program that would &#13;
           seek regular advice from key stakeholders such as other Ministries and Development &#13;
           Partners, as well as the proposed principles and methodologies for the operations of the &#13;
           Communications Program. Electronic database/ directory of current contact details of all &#13;
           stakeholders that are to be involved in the Communication Program. &#13;
     · Proposals on how donor funding could be sourced for the implementation of the Reform &#13;
           Communication Program including public, NGO and Private sources of funds from &#13;
           current and potential partners in Kenya that may be considered.   &#13;
&#13;

Annex 4. Situational Analysis: More Detail on the Key Findings &#13;
&#13;
The situational analysis carried out in early 2004 provides the basis for this communication &#13;
strategy. The analysis was carried out through desk research, focus groups discussions, indepth &#13;
interviews, and a national representative household rapid assessment survey that interviewed &#13;
3,000 people. A oneyear quantitative analysis of media coverage of water issues was also &#13;
undertaken. The key findings of this analysis are summarized below.  &#13;
&#13;
Water sector as a priority for poverty reduction:   &#13;
&#13;
Water is considered as a relatively high national priority by consumers &#13;
     · The lack of safe water supply was considered the fourth most important priority issue &#13;
           (overall) for Kenya (after poverty, HIV/ AIDS and unemployment). There were some &#13;
           provincial differences in this ranking, for example (and not surprisingly) Eastern and &#13;
           North Eastern Provinces ranked `lack of safe and clean water' as the second highest &#13;
           priority. &#13;
     · The MWRMD was ranked fourth in the list of ministries that most touch the lives of &#13;
           Kenyans ( Health received the top ranking followed by Education and Agriculture). &#13;
     · Water services were ranked second (after health) in terms of importance. &#13;
&#13;
Dissatisfaction with sector service levels:   &#13;
&#13;
Relatively high consumer dissatisfaction with current performance of water and sewerage &#13;
services &#13;
     · The majority of consumers (61 percent) are not satisfied with the performance of &#13;
           MWRMD.  &#13;
     · Only half (48 percent) of consumers are satisfied with the water services that they are &#13;
           currently receiving. The most often suggested improvements were about greater &#13;
           provision of clean tap water and other water supply mechanisms (e.g. wells and &#13;
           boreholes) to make water more easily available, and putting more effort into conservation &#13;
           of rivers and forests. Other suggestions included: commercialisation of water services; &#13;
           employing more qualified staff; using modern water supply techniques;and increased &#13;
           investment from Government. &#13;
     · Only 35 percent of consumers are satisfied with current sewerage services. Among the 65 &#13;
           percent who were dissatisfied, about 75 percent said that they lacked services. Other &#13;
           problems cited were blocked sewers, open manholes and no positive responses to &#13;
           complaints. The main suggestions for improvement were to expand the sewerage &#13;
           services, more chemical treatment of sewers, prompt emptying of sewer systems, &#13;
           building more toilets and latrines and employing more qualified staff.  &#13;
&#13;
Low levels of awareness and misconceptions of reforms among most stakeholders &#13;
     · Only 23 percent of the adult population from the survey of consumers is aware of the &#13;
           changes in the water sector. (There was no significant difference between urban and rural &#13;
           respondents on levels of awareness.) &#13;
     · Results from focus group discussions and indepth interviews showed low levels of &#13;
           awareness and understanding among consumer representatives but some general &#13;
           awareness among WSS sector managers with varying depths of understanding of the &#13;
           meaning and implications of the reforms. Representatives from NGOs and resident &#13;
           associations were among the consumer representatives who were most knowledgeable &#13;
           about reforms. &#13;
&#13;

     ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          · Of the 23 percent of consumers who are aware of changes, 94 percent of them thought &#13;
                that reforms were necessary. The main reason given for the necessity for reform was &#13;
                enhancing efficiency (54 percent), followed by replacing inefficient councils, benefits for &#13;
                economic development, minimizing corruption, ending shortages and reducing &#13;
                incidences of waterborne diseases. This `aware' group also associated reforms with &#13;
                positive improvements such as increased access to services for those not connected, &#13;
                improved efficiency in water provision and increased participation by the private sector.  &#13;
          · On the meaning of what changes in the way water is supplied would have to them, &#13;
                consumers mainly associated changes with increasing piped water supply to all, efficient &#13;
                supply and private sector companies taking over water supply and increased cost of &#13;
                water. &#13;
          · Stakeholders fear that changes in the water sector may have a negative impact, and &#13;
                specific issues of concern are an increase in the cost of water, loss of revenue by local &#13;
                authorities, loss of jobs in relevant Government institutions and the possibility of the poor &#13;
                being unable to access water. There was consensus from focus group discussions on the &#13;
                need to create a tariff structure that guarantees access to water by the poor.  &#13;
&#13;
    Institutional roles and private sector participation  &#13;
&#13;
     The majority of consumers believe that Government/local government has a role (92 percent) in &#13;
     the provision of water and sewerage services. Some 50% feel that the role should be partial as &#13;
     opposed to the other half who want full Government control. When asked specifically what &#13;
     Government's role should be, three main areas were mentioned. These were regulation (54 &#13;
     percent), policy making (55 percent) and supplying water services (47 percent). &#13;
&#13;
     A significant finding was that 64 percent of consumers want local authorities (through the &#13;
     Ministry of Local Government) to supply their water. This is followed by 20 percent who want &#13;
     the MWRMD, 8 percent who want private operators and 4 percent who want selfhelp water &#13;
     schemes. From those who gave reasons for their choice, the main perception was that it is the &#13;
     local authority's responsibility to supply water. This can be contrasted with the fact that a large &#13;
     majority (83 percent) of consumers feel that there is a role for the private sector, but have mixed &#13;
     ideas about the nature of this role.  &#13;
&#13;
     Multiple organizations active in the WSS sector &#13;
&#13;
     Desk research identified many organizations with multiple roles in the water sector. A number of &#13;
    these organizations have fears and concerns over reforms while others are optimistic and &#13;
     supportive of the reforms. The majority of organizations that are apprehensive about reforms are &#13;
     NGOs representing the poor or working on human rights. They are sceptical about the reforms &#13;
     and perceive them as an attempt by the government to abdicate its responsibility for providing an &#13;
     essential service.  &#13;
&#13;
     Consumers see water as a right, and also understand key responsibilities  &#13;
          · There is a very strong consumer sense of entitlement to the `right' of water supply (95 &#13;
                percent) that is close to people's homes and is regular. When asked what their one biggest &#13;
                wish for the sector was, most consumers said tap water for all households.  &#13;
          · The vast majority (81 percent) felt that consumers should use water in a responsible &#13;
                manner, and some others added to this major sentiment with ideas of protecting water &#13;
                pipes and taps, and reporting leakages and burst pipes. &#13;
          · There is a high consumer sense of responsibility for payment for water consumption (68 &#13;
                percent). &#13;
&#13;

 &#13;
&#13;
Understanding of costs and consumptionrelated payment, but concerns about cost increases  &#13;
&#13;
Consumers seem to have a relatively good understanding of the process of how water gets to the &#13;
tap, and what happens to sewage, and what type of costs are involved. Those that did have an &#13;
understanding of the costs involved in supplying potable water mentioned investment in &#13;
hardware/ infrastructure (90 percent), treatment costs (57 percent), distribution costs (51 percent) &#13;
and administration (41 percent). Of those that did have an understanding about sewage services &#13;
and costs, 88 percent mentioned waste treatment and 15 percent mentioned sewerage transport. &#13;
&#13;
There appears to be quite different ideas among consumers about who should be responsible for &#13;
costs, and this confusion should be clarified in communication with stakeholder groups. For &#13;
example, when asked who should pay for local/household level water supply and sewerage &#13;
service, 54 percent said Government, 27 percent said consumers and 13 percent said costs should &#13;
be shared. However, when asked who should finance capital investments in large water schemes, &#13;
82 percent of consumers said that this cost should be shared between Government, consumers &#13;
and other partners.  &#13;
&#13;
The different ideas about who is responsible for covering the costs of water and sanitation &#13;
services is an indicator that there may well be resistance to the concept of full cost pricing. &#13;
However, the fact that the idea of cost sharing was raised is encouraging. &#13;
&#13;
The majority of consumers (68 percent) believe that they should pay rather than get water free (32 &#13;
percent). Understandably, this sentiment was highest among formally employed people (80 &#13;
percent), lower among informally employed (69 percent), and lowest among the unemployed (53 &#13;
percent). &#13;
&#13;
Consumers indicate a high understanding that payment should be related to the volume of &#13;
consumption (support for consumption related tariffs).  &#13;
&#13;
Most consumers do not seem to know exactly what they are spending on water each month. &#13;
Results from the rapid assessment survey indicated that the average monthly cost of water is &#13;
Kshs 384, with 40 percent of people paying up to Kshs 500, 12 percent paying between Kshs 500&#13;
1000 and 7 percent paying over K shs1000. Some 40 percent of consumers report that they do not &#13;
pay for water. Further research is needed to establish whether these consumers receive a service &#13;
to pay for in the first place, or are not paying for services for which they are charged.  &#13;
&#13;
Fear that reforms will result in increased cost of water &#13;
&#13;
The majority of consumers (53 percent) are concerned that reform will mean an increase in the &#13;
cost of water. They attribute this mainly to the exploitative nature of private companies and &#13;
consumers having to pay the actual (full) cost of water (including improved technology): &#13;
&#13;
     · Some (31 percent) believe that the cost would decrease due to reform. They believe that &#13;
           this is because competition would push prices down; private companies would be more &#13;
           efficient, that there would be an increase in cost sharing and a decrease in corruption. &#13;
     · A minority (15 percent) thought that the cost would stay the same. They believe that &#13;
           Government would regulate prices; that reform would not have any effect; that cost &#13;
           would vary according to consumption levels; that private companies wouldn't &#13;
           overcharge because they would like to maintain customers; and that NARC Government &#13;
           promised affordable water. &#13;
&#13;
Mixed perceptions on water resource management issues &#13;
&#13;
The majority of consumers (77 percent) hold the false opinion that Kenya has adequate water &#13;
resources to meet its needs. The minority who believe that resources are not adequate (23 percent) &#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
     mainly relate this to widespread water shortages that they personally experience and do not &#13;
     display a good understanding of the reasons behind the scarcity.  &#13;
&#13;
     Fortunately most  of this small minority (75 percent) who do know about Kenya's water scarcity &#13;
     did say that water conservation is the best method of managing water resources and mentioned &#13;
     recycling of water, reforestation and population reduction interventions. &#13;
&#13;
     Other results show: &#13;
&#13;
          · The large majority indicate that the wise use of water is important to them (96 percent) &#13;
                but (75 percent) are not aware of any local water conservation programs. &#13;
           · There are mixed ideas about who should be in charge of water conservation at &#13;
                community level, but it was encouraging to see that the most popular vote was for &#13;
                communities to manage their own conservation (45 percent), followed by Government  &#13;
                (25 percent) and then individual consumers (12 percent).  &#13;
          · When it came to who should be responsible for water resource and catchment &#13;
                management, roughly half of consumers (47 percent) feel that it should be Government, &#13;
                and the other half feel that communities should be responsible (48 percent). &#13;
          · In terms of risks to water resources, contamination of water sources (93 percent) was &#13;
                considered the highest risk, followed by deforestation (75 percent), insufficient storage of &#13;
                water (70 percent) and the misuse (63 percent) and illegal usage (61 percent) of water. &#13;
          · There was a strong understanding that conservation activities cost money (78 percent), &#13;
                but no real understanding of the exact factors that would increase costs.  &#13;
          · There was consensus among respondents from focus group discussions that efforts to &#13;
                create a positive attitude and behavior change among consumer communities on &#13;
                conservation issues need to be initiated.    &#13;
&#13;
     Poor quality of media coverage &#13;
&#13;
     Coverage of changes in the WSS sector by the media is relatively ad hoc, event driven and, in &#13;
    most cases, not analytical (as revealed in the quantitative analysis of the coverage of water issues &#13;
     in the Nation and Standard newspapers over a period of one year). Interviews with editors of &#13;
     mainstream media organizations showed that they have a low level of knowledge on the holistic &#13;
     nature of the water sector reforms. &#13;
&#13;
     Findings also showed that the government is the main source of information on WSS issues &#13;
     reported in the media. Given this fact, there appears to be a need on the part of the MWRMD and &#13;
     the WSRS for a more proactive and systematic approach to managing the media.  &#13;
&#13;
     It is also interesting to note that the topics with the highest number of stories are water shortages, &#13;
     access issues and the cost of water. A deduction from this is that the media focus is on reflecting &#13;
     the biggest consumer concerns. The second most common set of topics are by privatization, &#13;
    conservation and water quality. These are followed by funding, water projects, creation of water &#13;
     institutions and water conflicts. &#13;
&#13;
     Media usage and trust among consumers &#13;
&#13;
     The most reliable recent research data on media usage is the 2002 `National HIV Behavioural &#13;
     Surveillance Survey' of 15,000 people conducted by the Ministry of Health.6 This shows that by &#13;
     far the most used media is radio (81 percent), followed by similar levels for television (49 percent) &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     6 These figures give a general impression of media access among the general population. For media planning purposes &#13;
    related to advertising, Steadman Research and Research International provide up to date media usage data for every &#13;
    quarter.&#13;

 &#13;
&#13;
and newspapers (41 percent). The RAS of 3,000 consumers for this strategy corroborated that &#13;
radio is the most used overall medium, followed by television and newspapers. &#13;
&#13;
     · Of the 81 percent who listen to the radio, 65 percent listen to KBC National (Kiswahili). &#13;
           Similarly, of the 41 percent who read newspapers, 85 percent read the Nation, and of the &#13;
           49 percent who watch television, 80 percent watch KBC. &#13;
     · When consumers were asked what their most trusted sources of information were, radio &#13;
           came out top (68 percent) followed by television (29 percent), newspapers (28 percent), &#13;
           barasas (9 percent), and women's groups (2 percent). &#13;
     · It was interesting to note that urban and informal settlement residents and women rank &#13;
           television higher than newspapers, and this is reversed in rural areas and for men. &#13;
     · Opinion leaders in focus group discussions said that they thought that rural consumers &#13;
           would prefer interpersonal communication, while those in the urban areas prefer the &#13;
           mass media. However, rural consumers in fact indicated that radio was their most trusted &#13;
           source of information and most used media. &#13;
     · Media research usage data7 show that a relatively high proportion of people have access &#13;
           to the mass media in Kenya. Although this proportion varies from province to province, &#13;
           and between urban and rural areas, more than 90 percent of Kenyans in urban and peri&#13;
           urban areas have daily exposure to some form of mass media.  &#13;
     · By far the most popular public meetings are those organised by the provincial &#13;
           administration (81 percent). &#13;
&#13;
Communication needs and preferences  &#13;
&#13;
When asked how they would like to receive information on water sector issues, the ranking by &#13;
consumers was radio, provincial administration, newspapers and the MWRMD. &#13;
&#13;
Sector management and consumer representatives expressed the need for regular updates on the &#13;
status of reforms and for more information on:  &#13;
&#13;
     · The reasons, benefits and effects of reforms.  &#13;
     · Effective water management and conservation methods. &#13;
     · Water safety and waterborne diseases. &#13;
     · Pricing structures and investments. &#13;
     · Opportunities for stakeholders. &#13;
     · Water resource availability in Kenya.  &#13;
&#13;
Sector management and consumer representatives also expressed a willingness to support the &#13;
formation of water forums as vehicles for information sharing and education, public participation &#13;
and cooperative management. In addition to these types of participation mechanisms, consumer &#13;
representatives showed an interest in establishing consumer watchdog bodies. &#13;
&#13;
Information needs expressed by sector management: &#13;
&#13;
     · Conservation methods and techniques, and new conservation approaches and their &#13;
           application. &#13;
     · Water reform status (including the establishment and management of Water Boards). &#13;
     · Effects of water reforms. &#13;
     · Rationale of water reforms. &#13;
     · Benefits of water reforms. &#13;
     · Developments in the water sector. &#13;
     · Opportunities for stakeholders. &#13;

          · Research updates in the water sector. &#13;
          · Causes and treatment of water borne diseases. &#13;
          · More legal information (laws on water).  &#13;
          · Information to consumers about how water supply systems work. &#13;
          · Management/conservation information. &#13;
          · Information on investments in the water sector. &#13;
&#13;
     Low current communication capacity &#13;
&#13;
     The current communications work in the WSS and WRM sector in Kenya is being done by the &#13;
     Ministry's Information Office (with a focus on media relations, activities around peak times such &#13;
     as Water Day and a couple of other projects when funding is available).  &#13;
&#13;
     Communications is recognized by MWRMD staff at Provincial and District level as an essential &#13;
     component of reform and, despite the current capacity problems, it appears that staff in several &#13;
     areas have taken the initiative of building positive cooperative relations with staff of other related &#13;
     Ministries through development and environmentaltype committees. &#13;
&#13;
     Despite the abovementioned existing activities, the current levels of WSS and WRM sector &#13;
     communications in Kenya are inadequate given the complexity of the reform environment and &#13;
     the difficulty of changing longterm behaviors.  &#13;
&#13;
     Need to strengthen public participation mechanisms  &#13;
&#13;
     It is clear that information dissemination is important, but not sufficient for successful reform. &#13;
     The Ministry needs to build or strengthen twoway consultation and participation structures such &#13;
     as stakeholder forums, networks and committees. Public participation and consultation are &#13;
     relationship building exercises that are key to good governance, and should become the `modus &#13;
     operandi' of the MWRDM. &#13;

Annex 5. Communication Lessons Learnt from Four Case Studies &#13;
&#13;
Reforms in the water sector are taking place worldwide. In Africa, several countries have undertaken &#13;
water sector reforms and many more are on their way. Prior to reforms, characteristics that prevailed in &#13;
Ghana, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda showed similarities although each country had its own &#13;
unique features.   &#13;
&#13;
Broadly speaking, all four countries were either experiencing an increase in their democratic climate &#13;
including new governance regimes, or were undergoing broadbased sector wide changes. . Notably, &#13;
the four were also faced with low WSS service levels and coverage. While Uganda and Ghana started &#13;
with rural WSS, South Africa and Tanzania first tackled the urban WSS. &#13;
&#13;
Case studies on water sector reforms in Ghana, South Africa, Uganda and Tanzania were reviewed for &#13;
this Communication Strategy. Communication lessons learnt from these countries and their relevance &#13;
to the Kenyan situation are summarized below:  &#13;
&#13;
Issues of Support and Ownership &#13;
     · In Tanzania and, to a large extent, South Africa, a deliberate peoplecentered approach was &#13;
           followed to instil a sense of ownership of the process at all levels. The approach ensured public &#13;
           participation through which programs were articulated to people right from the beginning. In &#13;
           the case of South Africa, this was done from a human rights premise since water is formally &#13;
           recognized as such. &#13;
     · Realistic timelines and expectations were communicated to the people in the initial phase of the &#13;
           reforms in all four countries. &#13;
     · Water costs and probable inflation rates should be articulated and customer readiness to pay &#13;
           for water services should be guided by their reliability.  &#13;
     · Reforms are likely to succeed if they are gradual, and are supported by a strong and sustained &#13;
           strategic communication effort. &#13;
     · Consultations with stakeholders should be undertaken to forestall future claims of alienation, &#13;
           and to enhance community participation and a sense of ownership. &#13;
     · Research played a key role in identifying the needs across the different sectors in all the &#13;
           countries studied and, in all cases, a sectorwide approach was necessary. &#13;
&#13;
Issues on policy formulation and water service provision &#13;
     · In all four countries, Government involvement in the reform implementation and enforcement &#13;
           was vital and supported by a clear policy framework.  &#13;
     · Communication pegged to broad national economic strategies such as the Poverty Reduction &#13;
           Strategy Paper in Uganda provided a strong conceptual basis for the reforms. &#13;
     · Use of role models and celebrities, especially those who champion human rights such as Nelson &#13;
           Mandela in South Africa, was found to be very effective. &#13;
     · International networking with multinationals was necessary, especially in areas of funding in &#13;
           order to meet expectations. &#13;
     · The private sector played an active role in making water a productive business even for low &#13;
           income communities in Tanzania and Uganda. &#13;
     · Water service suppliers were effectively marketed as a brand with competitive positioning and &#13;
           brand values in South Africa.  &#13;
     · In Ghana, water supply generated a means of employment for the same lowincome groups or &#13;
           communities. &#13;

     · The supply of water to lowincome communities required collaboration between the &#13;
           community and the utility to build confidence in the communities. &#13;

Annex 6. Glossary &#13;
&#13;
Campaign &#13;
&#13;
A campaign is a set of organized communication activities delivered through multiple channels to &#13;
inform, persuade, or motivate individuals to adopt new behavior or practices. It uses different tools and &#13;
is typically implemented within a limited timeframe. &#13;
&#13;
Communication channels &#13;
&#13;
The three categories are interpersonal channels, community channels, and mass media channels. &#13;
&#13;
     · Interpersonal channels include onetoone communication. &#13;
     · Community or group channels reach a group of people within a distinct geographical area or &#13;
           who share common interests or characteristics. Communitybased media, communitybased &#13;
           activities, and community mobilization are all forms of community channels.  &#13;
     · Mass media channels reach large audiences quickly, and include television, radio, newspapers, &#13;
           magazines, outdoor/transit advertising, and direct mail. &#13;
&#13;
Communication tools and channels &#13;
&#13;
Communication tools and channels are the various tactics adopted to disseminate messages. They &#13;
include advocacy, advertising, promotion, event creation and sponsorship, community mobilization, &#13;
publicity and entertainment vehicles such as television or radio programs, folk drama, songs, or games &#13;
that provide entertainment and educational messages simultaneously. &#13;
&#13;
Community mobilization &#13;
&#13;
This is a participatory process through which action is stimulated by a community itself, or by others, &#13;
that is planned, carried out, and evaluated by a community's individuals, groups and organizations on &#13;
a participatory and sustained basis to meet community needs. In addition to improving water, the &#13;
community mobilization process also aims to strengthen the community's capacity to identify their &#13;
concerns and the issues on a sustainable basis.  &#13;
&#13;
Focus group discussion (FGD) &#13;
&#13;
A research technique used to find out what a group of people with similar characteristic think and feel &#13;
about a particular issue. The discussions are conducted in an informal setting by a skilled moderator &#13;
among six to ten individuals. FGDs enable program planners to gain insight into attitudes, beliefs, &#13;
motives and behaviors of a target population on a particular research topic. Participants in focus group &#13;
discussions are carefully chosen to ensure that they have some common characteristic related to the &#13;
issue under investigation. Results from FGDs are used for many purposes, such as gaining &#13;
understanding of reasons behind certain trends, generating new ideas, testing communication concepts &#13;
or materials or to explain quantitative data. Generally, results from FGDs cannot be used to draw firm &#13;
conclusions for the general population.  &#13;
&#13;
Indepth interviews &#13;
&#13;
These are oneonone interviews conducted by a skilled interviewer. Indepth interviews are &#13;
characterized by extensive probing and openended questions. They are suitable for obtaining &#13;
information from knowledgeable respondents who may be geographically dispersed. &#13;
&#13;
Indicators &#13;
&#13;
A measure used to track progress toward achieving objectives such as the number of people reached.  &#13;

Key influencers &#13;
&#13;
These are influential people in the primary audience's social network, such as friends, relatives, &#13;
religious and other leaders. &#13;
&#13;
Longterm identity &#13;
&#13;
A unique set of associations that represent what the product, service, practice or behavior stands for in &#13;
the minds of the audience. &#13;
&#13;
Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) &#13;
&#13;
A form of quantitative research undertaken through a survey within a welldefined population to &#13;
identify knowledge, attitudes or practices on a particular research issue.  Respondents to the survey are &#13;
sampled so that each member of the population has an equal probability of being interviewed. Results &#13;
from RAS are used to draw conclusions or generalizations about the general population. &#13;
&#13;
Segmentation &#13;
&#13;
This process involves dividing the audience into smaller groups who have similar communication &#13;
needs, preferences and characteristics. Each audience segment requires tailored messages that will be &#13;
meaningful to the audience members. &#13;

Annex 7. Framework for Developing a Communication Plan for the &#13;
Water Service Boards &#13;
&#13;
This document provides the broad framework that can be adopted by Water Service Boards (WSBs) &#13;
while developing communication plans to support their work. Communication related issues that face &#13;
WSBs fall into two categories: &#13;
&#13;
     · Policy issues: The WSBs will be in charge of policy direction. They will ensure that the water &#13;
           service providers that they license conform with the Water Act 2002. This means there will be a &#13;
           need to communicate the obligations of the service providers to the public as well as the rights &#13;
           to which consumers are entitled.  &#13;
     · Operational and service issues: This involves providing a supportive environment for water &#13;
           service providers to successfully undertake their work.  &#13;
&#13;
Summary Guidelines &#13;
&#13;
     1. Develop objectives for communication: The objectives should be in line with that of the &#13;
           National Communication Strategy and should seek to increase awareness, improve knowledge &#13;
           of, and build support for water sector reforms.   &#13;
&#13;
      2. Identify the target audience: Select a target audience whose views and decisions may affect the &#13;
           implementation of the work of the WSB. At the regional level, these will be civic leaders, &#13;
           politicians, and water consumers at the domestic, institutional or commercial level. &#13;
&#13;
     3. Determine the content of the message: Findings from the communication strategy situational &#13;
           analysis available from the MWRMD have identified the concerns; attitudes and knowledge &#13;
           levels related to water sector reforms. Messages should be shaped to the interests and needs of &#13;
           the particular audience. Sample message themes can be found in Annex 9.  &#13;
&#13;
     4. Determine the main elements of the plan: These could include internal communication, &#13;
           external audiences, monitoring and evaluation, public participation mechanisms and media &#13;
           management.  &#13;
&#13;
     5. Select appropriate channels for delivering your message: A channel is a means through which &#13;
           the message is delivered. There are three main channels described in the glossary of this report  &#13;
           mass media, interpersonal and community. Each channel has different advantages in terms of &#13;
           the breadth and depth of the reach, relevance to target audiences, and degrees of cost&#13;
           effectiveness. In addition, the message source or deliverer (an individual or organization) must &#13;
           be trusted by the particular audience receiving the message. An example is the use of a &#13;

Annex 8. Example of a Brief for an Advertising Agency &#13;
&#13;
     1. Target Audience(s) &#13;
&#13;
           · Adults 2055 living in urban/periurban areas within households that have access to tap &#13;
                 water in Kenya.  &#13;
           · Adults 2055 living in rural areas with some form of water supply in Kenya. &#13;
&#13;
     The most important segment will be households in urban areas that pay for water.  &#13;
&#13;
     2. Objectives &#13;
&#13;
           · To increase awareness and improve knowledge of water sector reforms among key &#13;
                 stakeholders. &#13;
           · To build support for the water sector reforms among key stakeholders  &#13;
&#13;
     3. Obstacles &#13;
&#13;
           · Varied interpretation of the meaning of reforms among the adult population. &#13;
           · Perception that reforms will raise the price of water. &#13;
           · Fear that commercialising the water sector will deny the poor access to a basic resource. &#13;
           · Perception that reforms are being pushed for by donors and development partners. &#13;
&#13;
     4. Key Promise &#13;
&#13;
           · Water sector reforms will bring about improved access and efficiency in the provision of &#13;
                 water because communities will be more involved in water resources management and &#13;
                 provision.  &#13;
&#13;
     5. Support Points &#13;
&#13;
           · Currently a lot of water is wasted due to mismanagement and corruption.  &#13;
           · Reforms will help solve problems in the water sector by separating water management &#13;
                 and supply. &#13;
           · Government has created new independent institutions such as the Water Services &#13;
                 Regulatory Board that will regulate the supply of water including setting up of tariffs.  &#13;
           · Reforms will enhance collaboration between Government, communities and civil &#13;
                 society, which will result in better services.  &#13;
           · Water utility companies that have reformed their provision of water services have &#13;
                 resulted in increased access to water and more reliable supply. &#13;
&#13;
     6. Tone &#13;
&#13;
           · Reassuring and inspiring confidence. &#13;
&#13;
     7. Media and materials  &#13;
&#13;
           · Print Media: print advertorials, posters, brochures. &#13;
           · Radio spots. &#13;
&#13;
     8. Openings  &#13;
&#13;
           · National and provincial launches of water forums.  &#13;
&#13;
     9. Creative considerations  &#13;
&#13;
           · Can use statistics to demonstrate the impact of the reforms on efficient water provision. &#13;
           · Can use case studies from water utility companies that have reformed their services. &#13;
           · Kiswahili and English will be the main languages. &#13;

&#13;
Issue to be Addressed                                        Key Message in Communication &#13;
&#13;
Why is there need for changes/reforms in the                 These reforms will improve the efficiency of water supply, enabling more &#13;
water sector?                                                people to have access to water. Services will also be decentralized. They will &#13;
                                                             also ensure reliable supply of water in the long term &#13;
&#13;
What are the changes?                                        The government has separated the functions of policy formulation, regulation, &#13;
                                                             management and distribution of water. The government will only formulate &#13;
                                                             policy. Regulation and management will be carried out by the Water Services &#13;
                                                             Regulatory Board (WSRB) and Water Service Boards (WSBs). The Water &#13;
                                                             Service Trust Fund (WSTF) will assist in financing provision of water to areas &#13;
                                                             lacking adequate water services. Licensed water service providers (WSPs) will &#13;
                                                             provide water on commercial principles at the local level.  &#13;
&#13;
Is the government abdicating its responsibility in  It has been proven all over the world that the supply and distribution of water &#13;
the supply and distribution of water?                        improves dramatically and is much more efficient if managed along &#13;
                                                             commercial principles, as Government steps back into a policy formulation &#13;
                                                             role. In fact, there are many happy stories emerging from people living in &#13;
                                                             towns in Kenya where WSPs manage water supply on commercial principles. &#13;
                                                             A good example is Nyeri.  &#13;
&#13;
So, who will run water services then, if                     Water services will be run by WSPs who will operate as agents of water &#13;
Government steps aside from this function?                   service boards (WSBs). WSBs are independent government bodies created &#13;
                                                             under the Water Act who get licenses for water provision from the Water &#13;
                                                             Service Regulatory Board. There are seven WSBs in this country. Already, &#13;
                                                             there are several water service providers operating with great promise in &#13;
                                                             several major towns in Kenya. &#13;
&#13;
I'm a little confused. What are all these new                The Ministry of Water Resource Management and Development (MWRMD) &#13;
water institutions and what will be their roles?             will have the overall authority in formulating policy in the water sector. &#13;
Or is the government just setting up new                     Water provision will be overseen by the WSRB, which will regulate provision &#13;
institutions to create jobs?                                 of water through WSBs. Then, there will be the Water Resource Management &#13;
                                                             Authority (WRMA), which will oversee management of water resources. The &#13;
                                                             Water Service Providers (WSPs) will distribute and supply water to our &#13;
                                                             homes under licence from the WSBs.  &#13;
&#13;
Will the cost of water increase when water                   The Government has set up a regulatory body to protect consumers from &#13;
service providers take over?                                 unjust increases in water tariffs. Any increase in tariffs will have to get &#13;
                                                             approval from this board. Furthermore, there will be a Water Appeals Board &#13;
                                                             to which consumers may appeal against unjust tariffs. &#13;
&#13;
Will these water service providers only supply               Through these regulatory bodies, the Government has set up mechanisms to &#13;
water to those who can afford and ignore the                 ensure that all Kenyans have access to water at affordable cost including the &#13;
poor unable to pay for it?                                   poor.  &#13;
&#13;
If all these functions are transferred to different          These new bodies, which will be spread all over the country, will require &#13;
organizations, what will happen to my job at the  skilled and welltrained people. There will therefore be many new &#13;
Ministry of Water/local authority water                      opportunities for jobs in these organizations. &#13;
department? Will I be retrenched? &#13;
&#13;
Why all the fuss? After all there's enough water             Kenya is actually a waterscarce country. We can all ensure that the little there &#13;
for everyone in Kenya.                                       is goes round to everyone if we use water wisely and conserve it. Apart from &#13;
                                                             these efforts to ensure that water services are efficient, we all also have a &#13;
                                                             responsibility to conserve the water we have and use it wisely to ensure we &#13;
                                                             have more water next time we need it. &#13;

            Communication strategy for the water sector
            reform program in Kenya
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This communication strategy provides the
            broad framework that guides communication on the reforms and
            identifies the issues that need to be addressed to build
            understanding and generate support for the reforms. These
            issues were identified through a situation analysis
            conducted at the initial stages of the process of developing
            this strategy. The issues include: 1) low levels of
            awareness and misconceptions of the reforms including fears
            that reform will result in increased cost of water, loss of
            revenue by local authorities, job losses among sector staff,
            poor people lacking access to water, and exploitation from
            the private sector; 2) most of the people who are aware of
            reforms are generally positive about them; 3) relatively
            high consumer dissatisfaction with current performance of
            water and sewerage services; 4) strong customer
            understanding of the need for responsible use of water and
            accountability for payment of water consumption; 5) low
            conservation practices at community level, although the
            majority of the people believe that water conservation is
            important, and they recognize their role in managing water
            resources; 6) low understanding of water scarcity in Kenya,
            and the link between adequate water and sanitation and the
            health and wealth of the nation; and 7) poor overall
            coverage of water issues by the media. To effectively
            address these issues, this communication strategy seeks to:
            1) increase awareness, improve knowledge and build support
            for water sector reforms among key stakeholders; and 2)
            promote positive water and sanitation management and
            conservation practices among all key stakeholders.
