C1          COSTS&#13;
&#13;
1.      All power sector project appraisal economic analyses require as the most&#13;
fundamental inputs:&#13;
ï&#130;· Estimates of the investment and O&amp;M costs of the projects being proposed (and of&#13;
    the costs of alternatives stipulated in the counter-factuals).&#13;
ï&#130;· Estimates of the future costs of fossil fuels. True even for renewable energy projects&#13;
    since for these projects, the avoided costs of fossil fuels constitute one of the main&#13;
    benefits. Transmission and distribution projects need estimates of fossil fuel costs to&#13;
    calculate the economic cost of losses. Off-grid renewables and rural electrification&#13;
    require cost estimates of fuels used for lighting (kerosene) and self-generation&#13;
    (diesel).&#13;
The reliability of these estimates will determine the reliability of the CBA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FUEL PRICE FORECASTS&#13;
2.       In the absence of an official client government forecast, either the latest IEA&#13;
World Energy Outlook (WEO) forecasts or the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s commodity price forecast may be&#13;
used as the starting point for assumptions about future fossil fuel prices. Those in the&#13;
latest 2014 WEO are shown in Table C1.1. For the past few years the three forecasts&#13;
illustrated in Table C1.1 have been provided. For example, the â&#128;&#156;new policyâ&#128;? forecast&#13;
could be used as a baseline, with â&#128;&#156;current policiesâ&#128;? and â&#128;&#156;450 scenarioâ&#128;? as alternatives in&#13;
the sensitivity analysis and risk assessment.&#13;
&#13;

3.       Comparison of this latest IEA WEO forecast with that issued in 2008 (Table C1.2)&#13;
is instructive.   The 2014 current policies forecast for OECD coal imports in 2020 is&#13;
$134/ton; that issued for the same year in 2008 was $157/ton. For oil imports, the 2014&#13;
estimate for 2020 is $120/bbl, that issued in 2008 was $148/bbl â&#128;&#147; in other words, IEA has&#13;
revised downwards its long term price forecasts.&#13;

                                VALUATION OF DOMESTICALLY PRODUCED FOSSIL FUELS&#13;
                                5.       In countries that produce their own fossil fuels, many governments have long&#13;
                                kept domestic prices at prices much below international prices, justified on a variety of&#13;
                                arguments (shield domestic consumers from â&#128;&#156;unreasonableâ&#128;? or â&#128;&#156;volatileâ&#128;? international&#13;
                                prices, share the countryâ&#128;&#153;s resource endowment with consumers, why should domestic&#13;
                                consumers pay more than the cost of local production, etc.) One of the main&#13;
                                consequences of keeping domestic prices low is that they provide inadequate incentive&#13;
                                to invest in new supply â&#128;&#147; particularly in the case of gas, many countries are in difficulty&#13;
                                because low prices have discouraged investment in exploration and resource&#13;
                                development (such as Egypt, Vietnam, Indonesia).&#13;
&#13;
                                6.       Indeed, Indonesia is a good illustration of problematic domestic fuel pricing&#13;
                                policy, though in recent years some significant improvements have been made (in 2012,&#13;
                                the price of coal for power generation was raised to international price levels). Table&#13;
                                C1.4 shows the wide range of prices that PLN pays for gas on Java - ranging from&#13;
                                $2.84/mmBTU to $11.26/ mmBTU. PLNâ&#128;&#153;s LNG price is set by the international price (at&#13;
                                around $16/mmBTU in mid-2014, prior to the more recent price collapse). Among many&#13;
                                other problems, the economic valuation of domestic gas is an issue for calculating the&#13;
                                economic benefits of the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s proposed renewable tariffs.&#13;

7.      These prices are claimed to reflect the economic costs of production. However,&#13;
most of these fields are at various stages of approaching depletion, and the Government&#13;
is now in the process of establishing a national gas pricing policy to encourage the&#13;
development of additional supplies. At the very least, for evaluating the benefits of&#13;
renewable energy in this context, the very low financial prices should be adjusted by a&#13;
depletion premium to reflect the scarcity of the gas resource.&#13;
&#13;
The Depletion Premium&#13;
8.       The depletion premium is the amount equivalent to the opportunity cost of&#13;
extracting the resource at some time in the future, above its economic price today, and&#13;
should be added to the economic cost of production today. It is defined as follows 1:&#13;
        ( PS T ï&#128;­ CS t )(1 ï&#128;« r )&#13;
                                  t&#13;
&#13;
DPt ï&#128;½&#13;
               (1 ï&#128;« r )T&#13;
where&#13;
t         =       year&#13;
T         =       year to complete exhaustion&#13;
PST       =       price of the substitute (internationally traded coal) at the time of&#13;
                  complete exhaustion.&#13;
CSt       =       price of the domestic resource in year t&#13;
R         =       discount rate&#13;
&#13;
9.      The main problem in calculating the value of the premium is the uncertainty&#13;
about when the resource is exhaustedâ&#128;&#148;because the economically exploitable size of a&#13;
resource is a function of its market value and the cost (and technology) of its extraction.&#13;
Assessment of reserves can change very rapidlyâ&#128;&#148;as illustrated by the dramatic recent&#13;
developments in gas and oil extraction technology in the US (fracking).&#13;
&#13;
10.      Table C1.5 sets out the necessary assumptions for a sample calculation for a gas&#13;
field with a remaining time of 15 years to exhaustion, and for which the substitute fuel is&#13;
taken as LNG.&#13;

11.      Applying the above formula results in the economic valuation shown in Table&#13;
C1.6. The economic value increases as the time to exhaustion approaches, ultimately&#13;
reaching the value of the substitute fuel (LNG). The depletion premium calculation is&#13;
easily adjusted where the substitute fuel is assumed to increase (or decrease) over time&#13;
(as in the case of the IEA forecasts for LNG shown in Table C1.1).&#13;

Import parity price&#13;
12.     For domestically produced fuels that are also traded, calculations of the&#13;
economic value of a domestic thermal resource where financial prices for domestic fuels&#13;
are subsidized require an estimate of the so-called import parity price. This is calculated&#13;
from the identify&#13;
&#13;
     Price of imported coal + freight from port to domestic consumer&#13;
     = price of domestic coal (at import parity) + freight from mine to domestic&#13;
         consumer + incremental quality adjustment&#13;
&#13;
13.     When these prices are expressed in currency per ton, freight costs must be&#13;
adjusted for any difference in calorific value (often domestic coal is of lesser quality than&#13;
imported coal). This is sometimes taken simply as the ratio of calorific values. 2 In&#13;
&#13;
2       However, this relationship is not necessarily linear, and is true only of high calorific value&#13;
        coals. Low calorific value coal trades on international markets at a value that is lower&#13;
        than mere adjustment by calorific value would suggest: this is because low value coal&#13;
        may require blending with high value coals, increasing fuel stock management costs.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
addition, where there are large differences in ash or sulfur contents, domestic coal may&#13;
incur additional ash and waste handling costs. Thus the import parity price calculates as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IP    =      Import parity price of coal at mine gate in local currency/ton&#13;
E     =      Exchange rate&#13;
F1    =      Freight/Ton (financial prices) from port to consumer (market) in local currency&#13;
F2    =      Freight/Ton (financial prices) from mine to consumer in local currency&#13;
SCF   =      Standard correction factor (which adjusts for the tax component of domestic costs)&#13;
P     =      Cif import price, in $US&#13;
A     =      Coal quality penalty&#13;
G1    =      Gross calorific value of imported coal (kcal/kg)&#13;
G2    =      Gross calorific value of domestic coal (kcal/kg)&#13;
&#13;
Freight costs&#13;
14.      When building up a border price forecast for a particular location, freight costs&#13;
can be important particularly for coal.3 These can be as volatile as the coal price itself,&#13;
but are generally correlated with the underlying coal price: when the coal prices are&#13;
declining (as in Spring 2015), freight costs will be low; when coal prices is are increasing,&#13;
freight costs will (generally) be high (though there are some circumstances when this&#13;
does not apply). Table C1.7 shows selected freight rates in October 2014 compared with&#13;
those of February 2015.&#13;

CAPITAL INVESTMENT&#13;
15.     In a CBA, often the biggest problem in estimating capital costs is not for the&#13;
project being appraised (for which a detailed feasibility study prepared by engineering&#13;
consultants is often available), but for specifying the capital costs for the counter-factual -&#13;
which is just as important in assuring the reliability of the CBA calculations as those of&#13;
the project itself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3         Because coal has a much lower value per unit of weight and volume than LNG or oil,&#13;
          freight can make up a much larger fraction of the price delivered at the point of import.&#13;

&#13;
16.      Several problems are encountered in establishing the costs for a CBA:&#13;
ï&#130;·     How to find reliable data on technology costs and performance.&#13;
ï&#130;·     How to adjust past capital cost estimates to the price level of the CBA.&#13;
ï&#130;·     How to adjust technology costs for local conditions.&#13;
ï&#130;·     How to deal with volatile exchange rates.&#13;
&#13;
Reliable data on costs and technology performance&#13;
17.     In North America, the gold standard for a database on power technology cost&#13;
and performance was the Technical Assessment Guide maintained by the Electric Power&#13;
Research Institute (EPRI). Unfortunately, despite having access to a large numbers of&#13;
power projects all over the world, World Bank has not managed to maintain something&#13;
comparable. There is not even a simple database of capital costs of all World Bank&#13;
energy sector projects (as estimated in PADs, and as may have been adjusted in&#13;
Implementation Completion Reports). From time to time the Bank has commissioned&#13;
useful studies from experienced international consultants (see Table C1.7), but these&#13;
have not proven to be very useful for estimating costs in typical World Bank client&#13;
countries.&#13;

Adjusting past capital cost estimates&#13;
18.     Ideally, a detailed feasibility study would be available as a basis for estimating&#13;
construction costs of major energy projects, at price levels corresponding to the year of&#13;
appraisal. But that ideal is not always available. , If earlier costs estimates are just a year&#13;
or two old, the default for bringing these to the cost level used in project appraisal would&#13;
be application of the Manufactured Unit Index (MUV), published in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s website&#13;

19.     The net output of a new CCCT is generally quoted under so called ISO&#13;
conditions (International Standards Organisation), meaning at an ambient temperature&#13;
of 15oC, and at sea level. At the higher ambient temperatures encountered in tropical&#13;
countries, output reduces considerably: as shown in Table C1.10, a nominal 800 MW at&#13;
ISO project will have a net output of only 718.8 MW under actual ambient conditions â&#128;&#147;&#13;
making for a 10% reduction in output.&#13;

20.     Local variations in cost estimates can also be considerable, as illustrated in Table&#13;
C1.11 for the case of Vietnam. The overnight costs (ISO) range from $646 to 911/kW - at&#13;
2010 prices. But when converted to net $/kW (including IDC), costs are much higher.&#13;
Moreover, the difficulty for a project economist working in Vietnam is that the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s ESMAP META database shows an overnight capital cost for an 800 MW CCGT at&#13;
$552/kW â&#128;&#147; when actual costs â&#128;&#147; even gross at ISO â&#128;&#147; are in the range of 848-948$/kW.&#13;

&#13;
Exchange rates and market conditions&#13;
21.     A critical issue is exchange rates. Much renewable energy equipment is&#13;
manufactured in Europe, and hence costs are quoted in Euros: for a US$ denominated&#13;
economic analysis, foreign exchange rate volatility can therefore cause problems. For&#13;
example, suppose a detailed cost analysis by a German research institute in mid-2012&#13;
provided CSP costs at 3,000 Euro/kW. At the time the exchange rate was $1.26 per Euro,&#13;
so $3,780/kW. In early 2015 the exchange rate is $1.13 per Euro, or 3,390$/kW. The&#13;
relevant point is that exchange rate volatility is an important component of capital cost&#13;
&#13;

          maintenance and plant overhauls, a further 3-4% deterioration for ageing will generally&#13;
          arise.&#13;

uncertainty, which needs to be reflected in the sensitivity analysis. Moreover, for many&#13;
components of capital goods, market conditions can easily result in variations of +20%.6&#13;
22.     A 1996 study examined the construction costs and schedules of 125 thermal and&#13;
hydropower projects financed by the World Bank between 1965 and 1994. Construction&#13;
costs were underestimated by an average of 17% (standard deviation 34%), construction&#13;
schedules by 29% (standard deviation 29%).7 Whether a similar study of renewable&#13;
energy projects undertaken today would find better a better or worse track record of ex&#13;
ante cost estimates is an interesting question. These issues all make for increasing&#13;
importance of the risk assessment (Technical Note C5).&#13;
&#13;
Chinese equipment&#13;
23.      Finally to the question of Chinese equipment, whose quality variations are much&#13;
greater than those of European vendors. For small renewable energy IPPs, Chinese&#13;
small hydro equipment can be 35% cheaper than European equipment, but the trade-offs&#13;
between cost, efficiency, and reliability of Chinese equipment are generally poorly&#13;
understood. The main financial consequence of equipment failures (and delays in&#13;
getting spares) is often not the cost of the spare itself, but the loss of generation and&#13;
consequent revenue shortfall: what matters is life cycle cost, not first cost. Box C1.1&#13;
summarises the results of a study of the impact of technology choice for small hydro&#13;
equipment in Vietnam. This was one of the main issues in the implementation of the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s renewable energy development program: such questions need to be understood&#13;
in the design of such Portfolio projects, where the project economist typically plays an&#13;
important role. Whether or not the predicted economic returns can be realised in&#13;
practice depends upon the quality of equipment actually purchased, not what is&#13;
assumed at appraisal. The lesson here is simple: high quality Chinese equipment from&#13;
reputable manufacturers (whose cost may be considerably higher than the cheapest&#13;
offers, but still lower than European equipment) is often the best strategy, and which&#13;
should be reflected in the CBA at appraisal.&#13;

6       The mid term review of the Indonesian geothermal projects financed by the World Bank&#13;
        makes for interesting reading. The power plant capital cost estimate was made at a time&#13;
        of a sellersâ&#128;&#153; market, but by the time of the competitive bidding, it had became a buyersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
        market, with prices 20% lower. However, over the same time period, the cost of drilling&#13;
        soared, so coupled with long delays to raise additional equity for drilling, the net impact&#13;
        was still a substantial cost increase.&#13;

&#13;
                          Box C1.1: Impact of low-cost Chinese small hydro equipment&#13;
The question of the life cycle cost-effectiveness of low-cost Chinese equipment was studied for the&#13;
case of small hydro in Vietnam, where substantial numbers of projects procured Chinese turbine-&#13;
generators. European equipment is likely to be 50% more expensive than good Chinese&#13;
equipment: and that cost premium will result in better efficiency (average 87% rather than the 85%&#13;
of the Chinese equipment), and slightly lower routine O&amp;M costs (1.5% of first cost rather than 2%&#13;
assumed for Chinese equipment). It will also have longer intervals between major maintenance&#13;
events (T1 in the table below).&#13;
On the other hand, the cheapest Chinese equipment may be available at as much as a 40% discount&#13;
over good equipment â&#128;&#147; but at the cost of lower average efficiency (83% rather than 85%), higher&#13;
routine O&amp;M costs (3% rather than 2% of first cost), and a significantly lower interval between&#13;
major maintenance events (every three years rather than every 5 years). T2 in the table below&#13;
denotes the intervals between complete replacement of equipment.&#13;
&#13;

The study then examined financial returns as a function of the equipment choice. The table below&#13;
shows that indeed good Chinese equipment is the rational choice for SHP developers, and that&#13;
neither buying very cheap Chinese equipment, nor more expensive European equipment,&#13;
represent economically rational alternatives. However, reliability and availability of spare parts&#13;
are more important than O&amp;M and efficiency differences, and failure to include these factors in&#13;
comparisons at the procurement stage has led many developers into trouble.&#13;

Good Chinese equipment has resulted the best outcomes for developers. Of course the initial&#13;
outlay of cheap (poor) equipment is 12.5% lower, with a corresponding reduction in both&#13;
developerâ&#128;&#153;s equity and the required size of bank-loan. But generation is also 9.3% lower, and the&#13;
FIRR is only half that of good Chinese equipment.&#13;
European equipment, while better than good Chinese equipment, still has a 3% lower FIRR.&#13;
Moreover, developerâ&#128;&#153;s equity and loan size increase, and the first-year debt service cover ratio â&#128;&#147;&#13;
always of interest to the banks â&#128;&#147; is 1.3, as against 1.6 in the case of good Chinese Equipment.&#13;
Vietnamese small hydro producers lucky to have ended up with reliable Chinese equipment have&#13;
prospered, but those less fortunate have incurred losses as a consequence of poor suppliers, some&#13;
of whom vanished when major spares were needed.8&#13;

8          The 5.4 MW So Lo small hydro project is an example of an unsatisfactory outcome. The&#13;
           project was set up as 2 x 0.806 MW + 2.12 MW +1.706 MW. The developer stated that&#13;
           this unusual configuration was a result of a â&#128;&#156;special dealâ&#128;? on machines available from the&#13;
           vendorâ&#128;&#153;s inventory. Whether four turbines for such a small project is optimal can be&#13;
           debated, but if multiple units are to be used, they should be of identical design so that&#13;
           just a single inventory of spares can be used. When the plant was visited, two units had&#13;
           been down for several months awaiting delivery of spares.&#13;

&#13;
 PRESENTATION OF CAPITAL COSTS&#13;
&#13;
 Working capital&#13;
 24.     Only inventories (stocks and spares) that constitute real claims on the nationâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
 resources should be included in economic costs. Other items of working capital reflect&#13;
 loan receipts and repayment flows, and should not be included as an economic cost.&#13;
&#13;
 Contingencies&#13;
 25.      It is Bank practice to distinguish between physical and price contingencies.&#13;
 Physical contingencies reflect the value of additional real resources that may be required&#13;
 beyond the estimated baseline cost to complete the project, and should be included in&#13;
 the economic cost. However, since economic returns are generally measured at constant&#13;
 prices, price contingencies â&#128;&#147; which reflect increases in nominal costs due to inflation. -&#13;
 should be excluded from the economic cost.&#13;
&#13;
 Reconciliation of economic and financial costs&#13;
 26.      Energy sector projects in the Bank have traditionally followed a standard format&#13;
 for the presentation of project costs, with clear breakdown of what costs are incurred in&#13;
 foreign exchange and what in domestic currency; what are the tax and import duty&#13;
 components of each expenditure line item; and what are the price and physical&#13;
 contingencies (and how they are derived). Where construction costs were based on&#13;
 feasibility studies that were one or two years old, the standard format provided&#13;
 transparency in how costs were adjusted for inflation and exchange rate changes. This&#13;
 provides a credible basis for the reconciliation of economic and financial costs, that is the&#13;
 basis for the distributional analysis (see Technical Note C6).&#13;
&#13;
 27.     These various conventions are followed in Table C1.12, which illustrates the&#13;
 general format for presentation of investment costs, with clear presentation of what are&#13;
 local and what are foreign costs, what are taxes and duties, and what are price&#13;
 contingencies and interest during construction that are excluded from the economic cost.&#13;

&#13;
Levelised cost of energy calculations&#13;
28.      Comparisons of levelised cost of energy (LCOE) are widely presented. Many&#13;
purport to show that some forms of renewable energy are now competitive with their&#13;
fossil equivalents. Unfortunately for the reasons to be explained below, comparisons of&#13;
LCOE can be misleading, and may to lead to erroneous conclusions.9&#13;
&#13;
29.      Consider the comparison of LCOE for a 100 MW wind project compared to a gas&#13;
combined cycle presented in Table C1.13. With a variable cost of 11.0 USc/kWh&#13;
(corresponding to a gas CCGT with fuel costs of $14/mmBTU), the LCOE of a gas&#13;
project is 12.9USc/kWh (row [16]). At $2,300/kW and a 30% capacity factor, the wind&#13;
LCOE is 12.3 USc/kWh. The wind project appears less costly.&#13;

30.      OPSPQ indeed allows projects to be selected on the basis of a cost-effectiveness&#13;
analysis, but the important proviso is that the options considered deliver the same&#13;
basket of benefits. But the benefits of wind and CCGT are not the same. The highest&#13;
value of the output is that which is delivered during peak and intermediate hours. Most&#13;
of the output CCGT will be dispatched into these blocks, with little generation during off&#13;
peak, base load. However, the output of the wind project is not dispatchable into the&#13;
same blocks, but likely to be random throughout the year around each monthly&#13;
average.10 With a 30% capacity factor, the chance it will generate during the peak hours&#13;
is 30%, not 100%.11&#13;
31.    Suppose the daily load curve is defined as 4 peak hours per day, 8 intermediate&#13;
hours per day, and 12 base-load (off-peak) hours per day (as might typically be structure&#13;
of an electricity tariff definition). Let the benefit of peak hour generation be 25&#13;
USc/kWh (corresponding to the avoided cost of diesel self generation), of intermediate&#13;
&#13;
9       For a full discussion of the problems of using LCOE for comparisons of generation costs,&#13;
        see, e.g., Joskow, P. 2011. Comparing the Costs of Intermittent and Dispatchable Electricity&#13;
        Generating Technologies.&#13;
10      As discussed further in Technical Note T1, in tropical countries the seasonal variations&#13;
        are much higher than in Northwest Europe and the USA, so unless the seasonal&#13;
        maximum coincides with the time of the annual system peak, the firm capacity&#13;
        contribution of even a project with a good 35% capacity factor may be negligible.&#13;
11      That is not necessarily the case â&#128;&#147; at some coastal locations, the timing of regular evening&#13;
        sea breezes may correspond well to peak residential demands.&#13;

generation the cost of gas CCGT (12.9 USc/kWh, from Table C1.13), and the cost of base&#13;
load generation 6USc/kWh (corresponding to coal). Then in Table C1.14 we note that&#13;
since wind is non-dispatchable, and assuming that the probability of the wind project&#13;
operating in any given hour is random (with probability equal to its annual capacity&#13;
factor), then the wind project will contribute to each segment of the load curve as shown&#13;
in column [3]. Thus with a capacity factor of 30%, during the total yearly peak hours of&#13;
1,460 (row[1] of Table C1.14), the wind project will run (on average) in only 0.3 x 1460 =&#13;
438 hours.&#13;

 32.    Repeating this calculation for the other load tranches, then multiplying hours&#13;
dispatched by the economic value (column[5]) gives the total value in column [6],&#13;
resulting in an average benefit (avoided cost) of 11.5 USc/kWh.&#13;
&#13;
33.    In Table C1.15 the benefits of the gas project calculate to 13.8 USc/kWh: this is&#13;
because the CCGT is dispatchable, so generating during all peak and intermediate hours,&#13;
and generating a much smaller number of GWh during the low value base-load hours.&#13;

&#13;
34.     In other words, when the value of the output at different times of day are taken&#13;
into account (i.e. the benefit), the net benefit of the wind project is 11.5 â&#128;&#147; 12.3 =minus 0.80&#13;
USc/kWh, whereas the net benefit of the gas CCGT is 13.8-12.9=positive 0.90 USc/kWh.&#13;
Of course, it may be that the avoided cost of GHG emissions may make up for this&#13;
difference, but from the perspective of the buyer of energy, these are the incremental&#13;
financial costs that will be incurred. In effect, the LCOE calculation of Table C1.13&#13;
ignores the lack of capacity benefit of the variable renewable energy (VRE).&#13;
&#13;
35.     We therefore urge caution in the use of tools (including tools issued by the&#13;
ESMAP/World Bank, such as META) that present comparative results expressed as&#13;
LCOE. Box C1.2 shows an analysis of LCOE that properly adjusts for capacity penalties&#13;
of variable renewables.&#13;

Box C1.2: South Africa levelised cost comparisons of generation costs including carbon&#13;
pricing.&#13;
This study assesses the cost of power generation alternatives under different assumptions for&#13;
carbon pricing - namely without carbon pricing, and under the three scenarios for carbon pricing&#13;
of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s July 2014 Guidelines for the Social Value of Carbon (see Table M5.1 in the&#13;
Technical Note on Carbon Accounting). Carbon emissions are based on life cycle emission factors&#13;
from the US Department of Energyâ&#128;&#153;s Harmonisation Project (see Table M5.7). For South Africa,&#13;
cost and technology data were taken from the Medupi Coal Project PAD.12 For wind, a capacity&#13;
penalty was added: based on a report prepared by the German GIZ, the capacity credit was&#13;
assessed at 30%,13 so the capacity penalty was calculated as 70% of the capital cost of open cycle&#13;
gas turbine, which was added to the capital cost of wind.&#13;
&#13;
Levelised costs of energy for the generation technology options considered in South Africa,&#13;
without carbon pricing, are shown in Figure A. Coal is the cheapest option, followed by hydro:&#13;
onshore wind is more than twice the cost, and CSP 2.5 times the cost of coal.&#13;
&#13;
Figure A: No carbon price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
When carbon is valued at the baseline costs as suggested in the Guidelines ($30/ton CO 2 in 2015) â&#128;&#147;&#13;
as shown in Figure B - the cost of coal generation increases to 12 USc/kWh, and is now more&#13;
expensive than nuclear (and hydro) â&#128;&#147;but still remains below the cost of the renewable options&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This remains true even at the high carbon price scenario ($45/ton CO 2 in 2014). As shown in&#13;
Figure C: Onshore wind is still slightly more expensive than coal and CSP, but CCGT based on&#13;
imported LNG is slightly less expensive.&#13;

&#13;
These results would change somewhat under lower discount rates than the 10% used here.&#13;
Moreover, they are sensitive to the particular fuel costs assumed: lower discount rates and lower&#13;
LNG prices will make renewable energy more competitive.&#13;
&#13;
Figure C: High carbon costs ($45/ton CO2)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A different way of expressing the impact of carbon price on technology cost comparisons is to&#13;
calculate the switching values: what would need to be the value of carbon for the cost of two&#13;
options to be equal? These are shown in Figure D for South Africa. We note that switching from&#13;
coal to wind power or CSP with storage would require a carbon price much higher than that of the&#13;
high carbon price scenario.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Based on these analyses, the study concluded that&#13;
 ï&#130;· In the BAU scenario, coal-fired power plant represents the least-cost generation option among&#13;
    all 6 generation technologies in South Africa, due to large reserves of low-cost coal.&#13;
 ï&#130;· In the Base CO2 price scenario, nuclear power becomes more economic than coal-fired power&#13;
    generation, in addition to hydropower.&#13;
 ï&#130;· In the high CO2 Price Scenario, coal-fired power plant further becomes less economically&#13;
    desirable than CCGT fuelled by LNG.&#13;
 ï&#130;· Switching from coal to wind power and CSP with storage would require a carbon price much&#13;
    higher than that under the High Carbon Price Scenario.&#13;

&#13;
Best practice recommendations 1: Costs&#13;
(1) Valuation of domestically produced fossil fuel prices should be based on import&#13;
parity prices. This will generally be more reliable estimate than estimates of the LRMC&#13;
of supply plus a depletion premium. Reliable LRMC estimates require considerable&#13;
effort to prepare, which may not be available for most projects.&#13;
&#13;
(2) LCOE calculations should be viewed with caution, especially when comparing LCOE&#13;
of different energy technologies. These should always be accompanied by a comparison&#13;
of benefits, before any particular option is declared â&#128;&#156;economicâ&#128;? based on LCOE . Box&#13;
C1.2 shows how LCOE calculations can be corrected for renewable energy variability.&#13;
&#13;
(3) Although cost and performance data may be available from some of the sources listed&#13;
in Table C1.7, they need to be used with care. Many do not reflect market conditions in&#13;
Asia, where less expensive equipment may be available from China, and local site&#13;
conditions vary greatly. Costs in small post-conflict and fragile countries may be much&#13;
higher than average costs elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
(4) Even if variable renewable energy projects have good capacity factors, because of the&#13;
high seasonal variations in monsoonal countries it cannot always be assumed that the&#13;
capacity credit would follow the rules of thumb about capacity credits derived from US&#13;
and European experience (see also Technical Note T1).&#13;

Benefit sharing&#13;
37.    There is often confusion about the treatment of benefit-sharing â&#128;&#147; typically&#13;
money that is provided to local communities affected by a major investment project that&#13;
go beyond the usual outlays for any R&amp;R under safeguards policies.&#13;
&#13;
38.     Even though these may represent financial costs to the developer as may have&#13;
been agreed (for example as part of a concession agreement), they should be excluded&#13;
from the economic analysis â&#128;&#147; though obviously included as a transfer payment in the&#13;
distributional analysis.&#13;

15        While the financial benefits to the investor of an energy efficiency project are straight&#13;
          forward (given tariff forecasts), there will often be negative financial impacts on the&#13;
          utility.&#13;

C3       EXTERNALITIES&#13;
&#13;
39.      The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s 1998 Handbook on Economic Analysis defines externalities as&#13;
      The difference between the benefits (costs) that accrue to society and the benefits (costs) that&#13;
      accrue to the project entity.&#13;
But in practice, project boundaries are often much wider than the â&#128;&#156;project entity.â&#128;? For&#13;
example, flood control benefits in a multi-purpose water resource project may occur at&#13;
some distance downstream, and would not normally included in the accounts of the&#13;
â&#128;&#156;project entityâ&#128;? â&#128;&#147; but these have long been included in the benefit stream of a hydro&#13;
project economic analysis without being called an â&#128;&#156;externalityâ&#128;?. Thus a better definition&#13;
is with reference to the project boundary, the establishment of which is one of the first&#13;
tasks in the analysis.&#13;
&#13;
40.      In other words, externalities can be&#13;
         ï&#130;· local â&#128;&#147; such as the health damage cost incurred from NOx, SO2 and particulate&#13;
           matter&#13;
         ï&#130;· regional â&#128;&#147; such as the impact of a hydro project on fisheries many miles&#13;
           downstream and perhaps even in a different country (such as a Mekong River&#13;
           hydro project in Laos affecting Cambodia and Vietnam fisheries in the Mekong&#13;
           Delta).16&#13;
         ï&#130;· global â&#128;&#147; such as the damage cost from thermal power generation whose&#13;
           impacts are felt by the entire world.&#13;
41.     A rigorous definition of externality in the economics literature is more nuanced,&#13;
requiring not merely that a third party is affected, but also that these effects are not&#13;
conveyed through market price signals.17&#13;
&#13;
42.      Table C3.1 provides a checklist for the main externalities that arise in renewable&#13;
energy projects. Where these are significant, one would expect to see a corresponding&#13;
line item in the calculation spreadsheet of economic flows. The definition of positive or&#13;
negative is from the perspective of the impact on a renewable energy project (so avoided&#13;
GHG emissions are a benefit for a renewable energy project, but would be a cost for a&#13;
thermal generation project).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16       The old OP10.04 defined â&#128;&#156;cross-borderâ&#128;? externalities as those occurring in neighbouring&#13;
         countries (such as â&#128;&#156;effects produced by a dam on a riverâ&#128;?).&#13;
17       W. Baumol and W. Oates, 1988. The Theory of Environmental Policy. The classic distinction&#13;
         is given by the example of a labor intensive factory using coal for power, setting up next&#13;
         to a laundry. Soot that is deposited on clean washing imposes incremental costs on the&#13;
         laundry, and constitutes an externality. But if the price of unskilled labor in the area&#13;
         increases because the factory offers high wages, the impact of higher labor costs on the&#13;
         laundry is not an externality, because it is conveyed by a market price signal.&#13;

Road                Requires study     Many energy projects are in remote areas, which may&#13;
construction                           require major road construction through environmentally&#13;
                                       sensitive areas (geothermal, small hydro). The direct costs&#13;
                                       are routinely included in the investment cost, and&#13;
                                       arguments are often presented (though rarely monetised)&#13;
                                       that better (or new) roads in remote areas may improve&#13;
                                       agricultural productivity and promote local economic&#13;
                                       activity. However, experience (especially in small hydro&#13;
                                       projects) shows that environmental mitigation measures are&#13;
                                       difficult to enforce in remote areas. The costs of such&#13;
                                       measures are often ignored in the economic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
Hydro projects&#13;
Flood control       Requires study     The question for economic analysis is whether the&#13;
benefits                               constraints on operating rules (that require drawdown to&#13;
                                       allow for possible flood control measures), and/or the costs&#13;
                                       of increased storage, are justified by the downstream flood&#13;
                                       control benefits. The latter are often assessed as the avoided&#13;
                                       cost of dykes and other downstream interventions, but their&#13;
                                       credibility always demand scrutiny. See World Bank,&#13;
                                       Project Appraisal Document, Trung Son Hydroelectric Project,&#13;

Forestry impacts    negative           When a reservoir inundates forest, a range of forest values&#13;
                                       may be lost, including timber and non-timber forest&#13;
                                       products, and environmental services. See Box C3.1 for an&#13;
                                       example from Vietnam where the information was available&#13;

Downstream          Positive           The regulation provided by a storage hydro project will in&#13;
flow regulation                        principle benefit downstream hydro projects as well, which&#13;
                                       should be estimated and added to the benefits of the&#13;
                                       upstream project. This benefit is rarely acknowledged&#13;
                                       where the downstream project is in a different jurisdiction:&#13;
                                       downstream riparians often oppose storage projects&#13;
                                       upstream for fear that the storage will be used for a&#13;
                                       consumptive use, especially irrigation&#13;
                                          The classic example is the interstate water dispute&#13;

The economic loss of forest value should be itemized and included a projectâ&#128;&#153;s economic costs.&#13;
These losses were estimated by the Strategic Environmental Assessment as shown below: the&#13;
estimates refer to the forest impacted in the Zone of Influence which is larger than the project (and&#13;
reservoir inundated) area itself. The Trung Son project has the 6th highest value of timber losses&#13;
among the 16 projects for which data are available. The entries are all as lifetime present values.&#13;

&#13;
Box C3.2: Impact of carbon externalities on generation planning: South Africa.&#13;
Box C1.2 shows how the social cost of carbon can be included in cost comparisons of LCOE.&#13;
However, to provide additional insights as to how these results would affect the capacity&#13;
expansion plan over time, and how the cumulative impacts evolve, one needs to simulate the&#13;
entire system in the context of increasing power demands. Using a linear programming model,&#13;
the capacity expansion plans for South Africa and Bangladesh were simulated, first with no carbon&#13;
price, followed by the three carbon price valuation scenarios of the World Bank Guidelines ($15, 30&#13;
and 50/ton CO2 in 2015).&#13;
&#13;
Including the costs of externalities in capacity expansion planning and dispatch models, and of&#13;
GHG emissions and local air pollutants in particular, was first introduced in the US in the 1990s as&#13;
part of Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) procedures demanded by State Regulators. 18 There is&#13;
an extensive literature on such â&#128;&#156;environmental dispatchâ&#128;? models: 19 a term that captures damage&#13;
costs (or externalities in general) is easily incorporated into the objective function of optimisation&#13;
models.20&#13;
&#13;
Figure A shows the baseline expansion plan for South Africa: it is dominated by coal, with only&#13;
small amounts of imported hydro and gas, starting in 2020. Coal generation increases from the&#13;
current level of 254 TWh to 433 TWh by 2030 (with corresponding increases in GHG emissions).&#13;

With a baseline CO2 price of 30$/ton, coal generation starts to decline by 2020, with 2030&#13;

                                respectively, all have this capability.&#13;
19                              Linear programming has a number of shortcomings for capacity expansion optimization,&#13;
                                which leads to mixed-integer and dynamic programming formulations as the basis of&#13;
                                most capacity expansion models used by utilities. However, the objective of this study&#13;
                                was to demonstrate the principles involved, rather than provide a definitive study:&#13;
                                application of more complex models would unlikely lead to significantly different results&#13;
                                or much difference in the main conclusions.&#13;

At the high carbon price ($50/ton CO2 in 2015), gas comes into the generation mix already in the&#13;
short term, and retired coal plants are replaced by gas and the other alternatives, rather than&#13;
replaced with more coal projects â&#128;&#147; with coal generation by 2030 declining further to 290 TWh.&#13;

The conclusions of these system simulations were as follows:&#13;
 ï&#130;· A business-as-usual (BAU) least-cost scenario without any carbon price would see coal as the&#13;
    dominant and growing base load option that will increase power sector CO 2 emissions by 70%&#13;
    in 2030 from the 2014 level.&#13;
 ï&#130;· A low carbon price stabilizes coal generation with hydro and some gas, reducing cumulative&#13;
    (2014-2030) CO2 emissions from 5.1 billion tons in the BAU scenario to less than 4.8 billion&#13;
    tons.&#13;
 ï&#130;· Base and high carbon prices would lead to a reduction in the share of coal generation by 2030,&#13;
    bringing forward the entry of nuclear and gas/LNG.&#13;
 ï&#130;· Increase in average system costs is significant compared to BAU for all carbon price scenarios,&#13;
    and more than doubles from $42/MWh to over $90/MWh in the high CO2 price scenario.&#13;
 ï&#130;· Abundance of cheap coal requires a starting CO2 price of ~$50/t (high price scenario) for the&#13;
    generation mix to switch at a significant scale, bringing cumulative CO 2 emissions further&#13;
    down to around 4.4 billion tons.&#13;

C4      DECISION-MAKING APPROACHES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BEYOND CBA&#13;
43.      The traditional approach to power systems modelling (and to the related&#13;
preparation of so-called â&#128;&#156;Master Plansâ&#128;?), and to the conventional approach to CBA, fall&#13;
under a decision-making paradigm often described as â&#128;&#156;predict then actâ&#128;?. The&#13;
presumption is that given some set of assumptions about the future (load forecasts,&#13;
international energy prices) one can identify an optimal investment plan to meet the&#13;
stated objective, where optimality is defined as least economic cost (or in the case of a&#13;
project appraisal, choose that alternative with the highest NPV &gt;0). In a deterministic&#13;
world, or one where assumptions about the future were not subject to large&#13;
uncertainties, this approach performed well.&#13;
&#13;
44.      As levels of uncertainty increased, the results of a CBA were subjected to more&#13;
detailed sensitivity analysis, whose purpose is to examine the relationship between a&#13;
given assumption and the estimate of economic returns. The switching value identifies&#13;
by how much a given input assumption can increase/decrease for the hurdle rate to be&#13;
achieved. That provides satisfactory answers if there is agreement on the hurdle rate (in&#13;
an economic analysis the discount rate), and for uncertainties that can be credibly&#13;
identified. The main problem is that this looks just at one variable at a time.&#13;
&#13;
45.      In the late 1990s a new approach began to be used in CBA with the introduction&#13;
of so-called Monte Carlo simulation, first used by the World Bank for a power sector&#13;
project in the 1998 appraisal of the India Coal Mining Rehabilitation Project. 21 This&#13;
approach argues that because many input variables are stochastic, the calculated value&#13;
of ERR (NPV) is also stochastic: by repeating the CBA calculation many times (typically&#13;
1,000 to 10,000 times), drawing different values for input assumptions at each iteration,&#13;
one generates a probability distribution for ERR. So now the decision criterion is not&#13;
whether the best estimate of ERR is above the hurdle rate, but what is the probability of&#13;
not meeting the hurdle rate (i.e. how much of the probability density function for ERR&#13;
lies to the left of the hurdle rate). Technical Note M7 sets out the issues in structuring&#13;
such a Monte Carlo risk assessment:&#13;
     ï&#130;· which variables should be treated as stochastic, and how to formulate plausible&#13;
         probability distributions for input variables.&#13;
     ï&#130;· which variables are likely to be independent (for example, hydrology or wind&#13;
         speed variation, at least in the short- to medium term, are likely to be&#13;
         independent to variables linked to construction delays), and which variables are&#13;
         likely to be correlated (such as construction delays and construction costs).&#13;
     ï&#130;· Software options.&#13;
&#13;
46.      Monte Carlo simulation can often provide useful additional information, but still&#13;
suffers from several problems&#13;
ï&#130;· While the technique works well with variables that allow credible probability&#13;
    distributions to be formulated, it is unclear on what basis one assigns probabilities of&#13;
    future oil prices, or of the timing and magnitude of climate change impacts (say on&#13;
    the inflow hydrology of a hydro project).&#13;
ï&#130;· On what basis does one set the threshold of unacceptable probability â&#128;&#147; is a 30% or&#13;
    even a 50% chance of not meeting the hurdle rate still acceptable? Under the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
    classical prescription of risk neutrality, the remaining variance (once risk mitigation&#13;
    measures are in place) is not considered, so if the expected value of ERR is above the&#13;

     hurdle rate it would be acceptable even though the probability of returns falling&#13;
     below the hurdle rate is 49.9%.&#13;
ï&#130;·    The technique also works well where all the variables are independent.        But&#13;
     specifying covariances of correlated variables is often difficult.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ROBUST DECISION MAKING22&#13;
47.      The â&#128;&#156;predict-then-actâ&#128;? paradigm that underpins traditional CBA becomes&#13;
increasingly problematic as the degree of uncertainty increases. This is particularly the&#13;
case for so-called â&#128;&#156;deepâ&#128;? uncertainty, characterised not just by disagreements over the&#13;
likelihood of alternative futures, but also about how actions are related to consequences&#13;
(different models yield different results, characteristic for example of the climate change&#13;
debate), and by disagreements about objectives. The presumption in CBA is that all the&#13;
stakeholders agree that decisions be made on the basis of NPV (i.e. benefits &gt; costs) â&#128;&#147; yet&#13;
even among those prepared to accept maximising NPV as the main objective, there may&#13;
yet remain disagreement about the discount rate.&#13;

48.      The difficulties with this approach â&#128;&#147; say for power sector investment decisions&#13;
in a fragile country like Afghanistan is obvious: for example, forecasting what will be the&#13;
security situation in 5-10 years time is virtually impossible.       The so-called Robust&#13;
Decision Making approach turns this around, into an approach based on â&#128;&#156;agree on&#13;
decisionsâ&#128;? (Figure C4.2).       This approach was originally proposed by the RAND&#13;
corporation to inform policy choices under deep uncertainty and complexity.&#13;

49.     In other words, rather than ask â&#128;&#147; â&#128;&#156;given a forecast about the future, what is the&#13;
best investment decision (and tell us how sensitive is that decision to the assumed&#13;
forecast)â&#128;?, RDM asks â&#128;&#147; â&#128;&#156;given a set of decisions (or strategies), which strategy is the&#13;
most robust to an uncertain future, and what can we do to reduce vulnerability?â&#128;?&#13;
Computationally, RDM tests the performance of a set of alternative strategies for a very&#13;
large number of alternative futures â&#128;&#147; and then asks which strategies are the most&#13;
vulnerable, and which are the most robust, and then attempts to adapt the strategy to&#13;
improve its robustness.&#13;

DECISION-MAKING UNDER UNCERTINATY&#13;
50.      As noted, the fundamental problem in making decisions under uncertainty is&#13;
that forecasts of many key assumptions can be highly unreliable â&#128;&#147; well illustrated by the&#13;
difficulties of forecasting world oil prices. Yet it is surprising how few investment&#13;
decisions are taken in full recognition of the costs and benefits of making the wrong&#13;
decision.     Real options is one approach to this dilemma by recognising that there is&#13;
value in flexibility â&#128;&#147; it may be better to build a project in stages, rather than in a single&#13;
step, to hedge against the possibility that the second stage may not be required. So-&#13;
called Decision Analysis is another, in which each option under consideration is â&#128;&#156;stress&#13;
testedâ&#128;? against a range of alternative futures and the choice is made on the basis of&#13;
which is the least vulnerable to the main uncertainties.&#13;
&#13;
51.       The basic concept of robustness is best illustrated by example. Suppose there is&#13;
a choice between a hydro project and a gas project. If future gas prices are high, hydro&#13;
would be the best choice; if gas prices are low, then gas is the best choice. So there is a&#13;
cost associated with making the wrong forecast about oil prices: if you build the hydro&#13;
project, but gas prices fall, you have needlessly invested in the (irreversible) decision to&#13;
build a dam. Conversely, if you build the gas project and the price of gas soars, then you&#13;
have needlessly incurred the high price of gas generation (given long lead times for&#13;
hydro, one cannot quickly build a hydro project if gas prices were to rise). Thus, in the&#13;
illustrative example of Table C4.1, if the future gas price is high, the indicated (least cost)&#13;
choice is hydro. If the future gas price is low, gas is the indicated choice. The cost of the&#13;
hydro project is fixed â&#128;&#147; whether the actual gas price is high or low, the cost of 100 is&#13;
fixed.&#13;
&#13;
Table C4.1: gas v. hydro: PV(cost) $USm&#13;
                          future gas price&#13;
                          high           Low&#13;
Hydro                      100             100&#13;
Gas                        130              80&#13;
&#13;
52.     The costs of making the wrong decision (the so-called â&#128;&#156;regretâ&#128;?) may&#13;
considerable â&#128;&#147; these are defined by the off-diagonal entries in this table: if the gas price&#13;
proves to be high, and one has invested in the gas project, then one has incurred a&#13;
penalty of $30 million (because for the high future gas price, the best decision would&#13;
have been hydro); on the other hand, if the oil price is low, and one invested in hydro,&#13;
then one incurs a penalty of an extra $20 million.&#13;
&#13;
53.      The question of which project you build now depends on risk aversion. If you&#13;
are risk averse, you would build the project with the best worst result. The worst result&#13;
for hydro is $100 million, the worst result for gas being $130 million. Therefore one&#13;
should build the hydro project â&#128;&#147; which can be seen as a hedge against high oil prices.&#13;
On the other hand, if you are risk neutral, you can make a decision based on expected&#13;
value, but that requires an additional estimate of the prior probability assigned to high&#13;

or low gas prices â&#128;&#147; much more difficult. The following two examples demonstrate how&#13;
decision-making under uncertainty can be improved.&#13;
&#13;
Assessing climate risks on hydro-projects in Nepal.23&#13;
54.      The Upper Arun Hydroelectric Project (UAHP), which is located on the upper&#13;
reach of the Arun River, has been identified as one of the most attractive projects in&#13;
eastern Nepal. The Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) has given priority for the&#13;
development of this project to augment the energy generation capability of the&#13;
integrated Nepal Power System due to its relatively low cost of generation and&#13;
availability of abundant firm energy. The 1991 feasibility study recommended an&#13;
installed capacity of the daily peaking UAHP at 335 MW, with expected annual energy&#13;
generation of 2,050 GWh.&#13;

&#13;
55.      The objective of the analysis was to develop a methodology for assessing climate&#13;
change risk, and to assess how possible alternative designs perform under different&#13;
futures whose probability of occurrence, and impacts on inflow hydrology, are difficult&#13;
to estimate. A methodology for climate risk screening was developed that makes&#13;
connections between climate scenarios, project scale analyses, choices of decision&#13;
variables, and economic evaluations of results at progressively more detailed levels,&#13;
based in the results of a series of screening level analyses. A set of plausible climate&#13;
scenarios for analysis was proposed, which were then translated into a bounded set&#13;
hydrologic flow assessments, identifying system performance measures and decision&#13;
variables for making design adjustments, consideration of other uncertain non-climate&#13;
inputs, the calculation of impacts and â&#128;&#156;regretsâ&#128;? in multiple scenarios, and management&#13;
actions to minimize unacceptable regrets. The decision tree is depicted in Figure C4.1.&#13;
The modelling technique involves so-called scenario discovery (described in detail in&#13;
Technical Note M9) that identifies patterns in the outcomes of a large number of possible&#13;
futures.&#13;

24        The Arun River, one of the main tributaries of the Saptakoshi River, rises at a glacier on&#13;
          the northern slope of Mount Xixabanma in Tibet. The river flows approximately 300 km&#13;
          eastward across the Tibetan Plateau at an elevation of about 4,000 m before crossing the&#13;
          Himalayas and plunging into Nepal where it flows in a narrow 30 to 60 m canyon at a&#13;
          very steep slope â&#128;&#147;where the proposed project is located. The dam site is located about 15&#13;
          km downstream of the border with Tibet. The river has a catchment area of nearly 25,700&#13;
          km2 (only 400 km2 of which is within Nepal) and an average run-off approximately 200&#13;
          m3/s. Very little development has so far occurred in the catchment area.&#13;

56.     The climate change â&#128;&#156;stress testâ&#128;? then applies the climate change scenarios,&#13;
hydrologic model, and uncertainty analysis for other non-climate variables to a model&#13;
which captures the key characteristics of the Upper Arun site. The range of uncertainties&#13;
evaluated in the stress test included the following:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Climate Change: three scenarios were evaluated spanning a range of&#13;
        temperature changes from 0 to +6oC, and from -40% to +40% precipitation.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Wholesale price of electricity: values for wet season prices (Apr â&#128;&#147; Oct) of from&#13;
        $0.045 to $0.135/kWh were used, and for dry season prices (Nov-Mar) of from&#13;
        $0.084 to $0.252/kWh.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Discount rate: 3 percent to 12 percent.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Estimated lifetime of plant: a central value of 30 years was used, with low and&#13;
        high values of 15 and 36 years.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Plant load factor: 0.60 to 0.90.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Capital costs (for a 335 MW plan): $446 million to $1,338 million (at 2013 prices).&#13;
&#13;
57.       The stress test was then designed to answer three questions:&#13;
      ï&#130;·   How does the 335 MW UAHP perform across a wide range of plausible future&#13;
          conditions? Figure C4.5 shows the performance of the investment options in&#13;
          6,500 plausible futures, defined by combinations of the above variable inputs.&#13;
          The 335 MW project results in positive NPV in the vast majority of these futures.&#13;
          When only varying climate, the designâ&#128;&#153;s performance is positive in all futures.&#13;
          Nonetheless, when we vary all dimensions, there are some futures in which it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
September 2015                                                                                                  28&#13;
&amp;#12;                      C4 APPROACHES TO DECISION-MAKING&#13;
&#13;
        has a negative NPV (grey shaded area). In general these results may imply that&#13;
        the project is quite robust to both climate and non-climate factors. However, the&#13;
        specific conditions that lead to negative NPVs can be identified and investigated&#13;
        further to better understand whether they are likely and whether they might be&#13;
        mitigated.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Note: The grey shaded areas shows the futures where NPV is negative&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Under what conditions does the 335 MW design for the UAHP fail to meet the&#13;
        target of NPV&gt;0? The results for the 335 MW project revealed that its NPV is&#13;
        negative for a scenario when capital costs increase significantly and this increase&#13;
        in costs is not made up by increases in stream flow or the price of electricity.&#13;
        Specifically the problematic scenario is one where actual capital costs increase by&#13;
        90% or more, exceeding $850million, and the electricity price in the wet season&#13;
        does not increase by more than 80% (thus it is less than $0.082/kWh) and&#13;
        precipitation does not increase by more than 10%, or decreases. The lifetime of&#13;
        the investment, the discount rate, the actual plant load factor, or changes in&#13;
        average temperature are less important in determining whether the 335 MW&#13;
        UAHP is economically sound. The results imply that increases in capital costs&#13;
        are the primary factor in the future success of the project.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Are those conditions sufficiently likely or unacceptable that other options&#13;
        should be considered? The analysis of the 335 MW design of UAHP has&#13;
        revealed that the project is robust to changes in climate. It has also shown that in&#13;
        some conditions primarily related to increases in capital costs, the projectâ&#128;&#153;s NPV&#13;
        can be negative. While these conditions do not appear highly likely, they should&#13;
        be carefully considered during project development. In addition, the analysis&#13;
        revealed that there might be potential for realizing additional hydropower&#13;
        generating potential at the UAHP site. Given that the climate risks were very&#13;
        low, and that much greater hydropower potential was available for larger&#13;
        design capacities, the analysis proceeded to Phase 4 to assess alternative designs.&#13;
        While typically Phase 4 (and adaptation generally) is considered a process by&#13;
        which climate risks are managed, instead here an opportunity is investigated.&#13;
&#13;
58.      The Phase 4 Risk Management phase analysis added to the Phase 3 â&#128;&#156;stress testâ&#128;?&#13;
the following hydropower design capacities for evaluation, in addition to â&#128;&#156;base caseâ&#128;?&#13;
335 MW: 750 MW, 1,000 MW, 1,355 MW, and 2,000 MW. The analysis then sought to&#13;
answer a further three questions:&#13;
    ï&#130;· How do the different options perform across a wide range of plausible future&#13;
         conditions? What is the most robust of these investment options? The climate&#13;
         change analysis showed that each of the designs were robust to the broad range&#13;
         of plausible climate changes, although the largest designs of 1,355 MW and 2,000&#13;
&#13;
September 2015                                                                           29&#13;
&amp;#12;                      C4 APPROACHES TO DECISION-MAKING&#13;
&#13;
        MW did show vulnerability to drier conditions. The other designs were clearly&#13;
        robust to climate change. These NPV results are shown in Figure C4.6 below.&#13;
        An additional metric for comparing different projectsâ&#128;&#153; performances, especially&#13;
        in terms of realizing opportunities, is the regret metric. In this study, we&#13;
        investigate which project performs better across futures, i.e., which option&#13;
        minimized the maximum regret (the relative lowest NPV) across the 6,500&#13;
        futures. The option that minimizes the maximum regret across these futures is&#13;
        the 1,000 MW design dam. The results imply that the 1,000 MW design is best&#13;
        able to take advantage of opportunities without suffering too much in other&#13;
        futures. Thus there is a potential trade-off between the design that performs&#13;
        near the best and that which is highly unlikely to have a negative NPV (the 335&#13;
        MW design). A further step in the analysis is to carefully evaluate the scenarios&#13;
        under which the 1,000 MW design does poorly and consider whether those&#13;
        scenarios are likely and whether then could be mitigated. This scenario is&#13;
        identified below. The result of such an analysis would provide the confidence to&#13;
        conclude that the 1,000 MW design is the best for UAHP.&#13;
&#13;
        Figure C4.6: Distribution of NPV ($billion) for UAHP at various project sizes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Under what conditions does the 1,000 MW UAHP fail to meet our target of&#13;
        NPV&gt;0? Using the scenario discovery technique described in Technical Note&#13;
        M9, the common dimensions of the futures where investments do not perform&#13;
        well were identified. The 1,000 MW dam is vulnerable to the following&#13;
        conditions:&#13;
        ï&#130;· The electricity price in the wet season is less than $0.092/kWh, and&#13;
        ï&#130;· Actual capital costs increase by 50% (or more)&#13;
        These two conditions need to occur at the same time for the 1,000 MW project to&#13;
        show a negative NPV. Again, the lifetime of the investment, the discount rate,&#13;
        the actual plant load factor, and changes in average temperature and&#13;
        precipitation are less important in determining whether the projects are&#13;
        economically sound. For this investment then, changes in climate are not&#13;
        amongst the main conditions that affect the economic performance of the dam.&#13;
        Thus electricity prices and capital costs again emerge as key considerations for&#13;
        the design of UAHP.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Are those conditions sufficiently likely or unacceptable that we should at&#13;
        least consider other options? Or, can the policy makers decide on the&#13;
        preferred investments based on this information? Before deciding to invest in&#13;
        the 1,000 MW, the Government of Nepal (GoN) should carefully assess whether&#13;
        the two conditions are likely to happen together. The electricity price and an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
September 2015                                                                          30&#13;
&amp;#12;                       C4 APPROACHES TO DECISION-MAKING&#13;
&#13;
        increase the capital costs, although uncertain, to a certain extent fall under the&#13;
        control of the decision makers. In the case of the electricity price, Government&#13;
        and investors may negotiate to make sure the price does not fall below the&#13;
        threshold that influences the vulnerability of the investment. Power purchasing&#13;
        agreements then are crucial for the success of hydropower investments in the&#13;
        Upper Arun. However, the electricity prices required to avoid vulnerability are&#13;
        much higher than the current negotiated tariff for national markets â&#128;&#147; so it may&#13;
        be difficult to find an agreement on this variable. Nevertheless, the Government&#13;
        could move away from a national focus and negotiate wet season exports to&#13;
        India.&#13;
&#13;
59.     In any event, the Government should carefully assess the conditions that lead to&#13;
implementation delays that are one of the main reasons for capital cost overruns: 90% of&#13;
hydropower projects in Nepal overshoot their initial cost estimates. NEA and other&#13;
regional experts should support the Government in a discussion of the plausibility of&#13;
incurring in 50% higher costs than initially estimated.&#13;
&#13;
60.     These risks and their plausibility or acceptability need to be considered by&#13;
decision makers and they themselves need to make the final choice. The policy-makers&#13;
themselves will in the end make the call of whether the presented risks are sufficiently&#13;
acceptable to justify the investment. This is precisely the advantage of DMU approaches:&#13;
the decision is back in the policy-makers hands, and presented in as a transparent way&#13;
as possible. These types of analysis can help them make informed choices, even when&#13;
they cannot have confidence about what the future will bring.&#13;
&#13;
Setting renewable energy targets in Croatia25&#13;
61.      The question posed by the Government of Croatia was how to set a target for&#13;
renewable energy. While they accepted that the optimal amount of renewable energy is&#13;
given by the intersection of the supply curve for renewable energy with the avoided&#13;
social cost of thermal generation, that calculation is subject to a wide range of potential&#13;
uncertainties about the evolution of capital costs for renewable energy, the level of&#13;
international energy prices, and what technology would renewable energy displace. In&#13;
other words, different assumptions would lead to a different decision.&#13;
&#13;
62.      Table C4.2 shows the results of such a scenario analysis of RE targets under&#13;
three sets of input assumptions (each represented by a column in the table):&#13;
     ï&#130;· Unfavourable assumptions (for renewables). Higher than expected capital costs for&#13;

         based on combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) (that have the lowest emissions&#13;
         of local air pollutants per kilowatt-hour generated, and hence low benefits&#13;
         derived from their avoidance by renewable energy).&#13;
     ï&#130;· Expected assumptions. As presently seen by the government as the most likely.&#13;
     ï&#130;· Favourable assumptions (for renewables). Low capital costs for wind turbines, high&#13;
         valuations of local environmental damage costs, and avoided social costs based&#13;
         on coal.&#13;
63.      The result is a wide range of potential targets, ranging from 37 MW to 1,337&#13;
MW. The range is so large because of the high uncertainty in many of the input&#13;
assumptions, such as the damage cost of thermal generation (which varies by a factor of&#13;
4.5). Given such wide ranges in the value of the target, how should one proceed?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  64.     Such ranges in uncertainty exist in many planning problems, and one approach&#13;
  to making a decision is to ask about the robustness of the decision. Suppose we choose&#13;
  the 317 MW target based on an assessment of what is most likely, and make investments&#13;
  to reach that target: renewables replace a mix of gas combined-cycle combustion turbine&#13;
  (CCCT) and coal, and wind turbine capital costs fall to â&#130;¬600/kW, which brings about&#13;
  estimated annual economic benefits of â&#130;¬13.5 million.&#13;
&#13;
  65.     But suppose that having settled on and built the 317 MW target, the future&#13;
  brings unfavourable conditionsâ&#128;&#148;wind replaces only gas CCCT, and capital costs fall to&#13;
  only â&#130;¬675/kW. What then are the net benefits? And what are the net benefits of the more&#13;
  favourable assumptions? Indeed, for the three scenarios portrayed above, there are nine&#13;
  combinations of assumptions and futures.&#13;
&#13;
  66.      The various outcomes of this analysis, with three choices and three actual&#13;
  outcomes, can be displayed in a 3 x 3 matrix, as shown in Table C4.3. The entries in&#13;
  columns [1], [2], and [3] represent the net benefits that correspond to each choice&#13;
  (represented by the rows). For example, if we choose the 317 MW target, but the actual&#13;
  outcome is unfavourable, then there is a net loss of â&#130;¬4.1 million, or if we choose the 1,334&#13;
  MW target, and the actual outcome is indeed favourable, there is a net benefit of â&#130;¬63.1&#13;

  67.     How one makes a decision on the basis of these estimates of costs and benefits&#13;
  then depends upon the:&#13;
       ï&#130;· Judgments about the probability of different outcomes&#13;
       ï&#130;· The decision makerâ&#128;&#153;s risk aversion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  September 2015                                                                                             32&#13;
&amp;#12;                           C4 APPROACHES TO DECISION-MAKING&#13;
&#13;
68.     Suppose all three outcomes were thought to be equally likely (that is, with a&#13;
probability of 33.3 percent, as in table C4.3). Then we may compute the expected value&#13;
of each of the three alternative decisions, as shown in column [4]. For example, the&#13;
expected value, E{ }, for the 317 MW target is:&#13;
     E{expected assumptions} = -4.1 x 0.333 + 13.5 x 0.333 + 29.9 x 0.333 = â&#130;¬13.1 million.&#13;
69.    Similar calculations result in optimistic and pessimistic expected values. If the&#13;
government is risk neutral, then the target should be the optimistic one of 1,334 MW&#13;
because it has the highest expected value (â&#130;¬22.9 million).&#13;
&#13;
70.      On the other hand, if the government is risk averse, then an alternative criterion&#13;
is the Mini-Max decision rule, which calls for choosing the option that has the best worst&#13;
outcome. Column [5] of table C4.3 shows the worst outcome for each target; based on&#13;
this criterion the 37 MW target is optimal, since it has the best worst outcome of +â&#130;¬4.5&#13;
million.&#13;
&#13;
71.      The assumptions favourable to renewable energy are based on coal being the&#13;
fossil fuel being displaced, but given the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s policy not to build a new coal&#13;
plant, a lower probability may be assigned to this scenario. For example, if the&#13;
favourable scenario (with coal as the avoided cost) is given only a 5 percent chance of&#13;
occurring, then the payoff matrix will appear as shown in Table C4.4.&#13;

&#13;
72.     Now the gain in expected value by choosing the 1,337 MW target over the mid-&#13;
level 317 MW target (from â&#130;¬9.0 to â&#130;¬9.5million) is quite small, particularly when faced&#13;
with a possible â&#130;¬7.4 million loss if the unfavourable future becomes true.&#13;
&#13;
73.     Such analysis may well require many additional assumptions, but it has the&#13;
advantage that it forces decision makers to be explicit about their risk preferences, and&#13;
makes the connection between assumptions and the robustness of decisions more&#13;
transparent.&#13;

C5      RISK ASSESSMENT&#13;
&#13;
74.     Risks may be classified into three main types:&#13;
        ï&#130;· Those for which probability density functions can reasonably be defined (such&#13;
          as hydrology variations in the case of hydro projects, or wind variability in the&#13;
          case of wind farms). A number of studies have assessed the probabilities of&#13;
          construction cost overruns and construction cost delays.&#13;
        ï&#130;· Those for which there exists little or no basis for the assignment of probabilities&#13;
          (such as the timing and occurrence of oil market disruptions of the type that&#13;
          occurred in 1973 or during the Gulf War).&#13;
        ï&#130;· Ignorance, for which there is no knowledge of the possible outcomes, much&#13;
          less a basis for assigning a probability distribution.&#13;
&#13;
75.      The risks in the first category are typically (and usefully) treated in a&#13;
quantitative risk assessment using so-called Monte Carlo simulation (see Technical Note&#13;
M7). Such a simulation may also include some variables in the second category, though&#13;
the burden on the economist to construct credible probability distributions is&#13;
significantly greater (for example in the case of alternative fuel price scenarios, how to&#13;
assign probabilities to the three forecasts in the IEA World Energy Outlook). Therefore a&#13;
Monte Carlo simulation is frequently accompanied by a scenario analysis.&#13;
&#13;
THE ASYMMETRY OF RISKS&#13;
76.     Mathur26 discusses the importance of distinguishing between pure risk and&#13;
downside risk.     Pure risk corresponds roughly to the variance of a probability&#13;
distribution, whose implication is that favourable as well as adverse events may occur.&#13;
However â&#128;&#156;downside riskâ&#128;? refers to events for which there is no corresponding â&#128;&#156;upsideâ&#128;?&#13;
event (which is linked to the popular interpretation of risk as adverse events).&#13;
&#13;
77.      Downside risk is an important â&#128;&#147; though little recognized -- issue for renewable&#13;
energy generation projects. Notwithstanding that natureâ&#128;&#153;s inputs â&#128;&#147; rainfall, solar&#13;
insolation, wind â&#128;&#147; have well-defined probability distributions, offering the prospect of&#13;
some number of high wind or precipitation years as well as low wind or precipitation&#13;
years, the moment a physical structure is built to exploit that resource, the ability to&#13;
profit from favourable events becomes constrained (unless the structure is built to an&#13;
infinite size). Run-of-river small hydro is the classic example: flows greater than the&#13;
design flow are simply passed over the weir, while flows lower than the design flow&#13;
cause immediate reduction in output. Thus the actual (chance) distribution of annual&#13;
energy generation will be truncated on the upside, but fully exposed on the downside.&#13;
Large hydro projects with significant annual or monthly carryover storage capture more&#13;
of the potential upside.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISK V RETURN&#13;
78.     The relationship of risk and return is an important issue for energy policy, tariff&#13;
design, and project appraisal. The relationship is fundamental to private sector&#13;
involvement in an energy project, because the required rate of return will depend on the&#13;
investorsâ&#128;&#153; perception of risk â&#128;&#147; which may itself vary across the stages of project&#13;
development. For example, an investor in a geothermal work area, who may bear the&#13;

&#13;
cost of geothermal exploration drilling entirely from equity (since lenders are reluctant&#13;
to provide debt at this stage of development), may require returns on that high risk&#13;
equity typically in the range of 22-25%. Subsequent injections of equity during&#13;
delineation drilling may demand a lower equity return of 17-20%, while once the steam&#13;
resource is proven, and just the power plant remains to be developed, any remaining&#13;
equity requirement might be priced at 14-16%.27 Box C5.1 provides another illustration&#13;

                           Box C5.1: Changing risk perceptions in a wind project&#13;
The Garrad Hassan study of risk in wind farm financing provides an interesting perspective on the&#13;
perceptions of lenders about the relative importance of these various risks (in a European project),&#13;
and how risk change as a project progresses. As shown below, prior to operation, the&#13;
measurement accuracy of wind speed is perceived as the major risk; following operation, inflation&#13;
is the biggest concern.&#13;

79.      The 2008 global financial crisis highlighted the dangers of reliance on the&#13;
Gaussian world of portfolio analysis, where risks are symmetrical, â&#128;&#156;fat tailsâ&#128;? ignored,&#13;
and risk vanishes in diversification.28 Portfolio risk diversification may have relevance&#13;
in some Bank renewable energy projects characterised by many small subprojects, but&#13;
the proposition that the risk profile of a renewable energy project involving major civil&#13;
works structures (the typical hydropower/flood control/irrigation project), or a large&#13;
CSP project whose capital costs may exceed a billion dollars, can be diversified away by&#13;
symmetrical risks in a portfolio of other renewable energy sector projects seems very&#13;
doubtful. Even if it were argued that the relevant basis for risk diversification is the&#13;
entire country energy portfolio, there are very large differences in risk exposure and&#13;
project size between, say, a distribution system rehabilitation project and a CSP project.&#13;
&#13;
80.     One approach is to evaluate the tradeoffs between economic returns and risk&#13;
using mean-variance portfolio theory (see Technical Note M8), which examines the&#13;
trade-off between expected economic returns (say measured as the levelised cost of&#13;
energy) against risk (standard deviation of returns). In the example below, the expected&#13;
value of annual tariff is plotted against portfolio risk for a set of sample portfolio of&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
SCENARIO ANALYSIS&#13;
81.     In the real world it would be very unusual for just a single assumption to prove&#13;
incorrect: in most instances several of the forecast variables will deviate from the&#13;
expectations at appraisal. In the most unfavourable future, several variables may all be&#13;
at values that diminish the expected economic returns. And in a favourable future,&#13;
several variables may be at values that increase the economic returns.&#13;
&#13;
82.      One way of dealing with such uncertainty is to postulate a range of typical&#13;
scenarios: one that represents a pessimistic case, with several variables at unfavourable&#13;
value, one that represents the conditions estimated at appraisal to be most likely, and&#13;
one that represents a favourable future. In the context of a renewable energy planning&#13;
or investment decision, the pessimistic case might be one where fossil fuel prices fall,&#13;
and investment costs are higher than expected; the optimistic case would be one where&#13;
fossil prices increase, and future costs of renewable energy technology falls.&#13;
&#13;
83.      Such an analysis highlights provides an assessment of how a project would fare&#13;
under unfavourable outcomes â&#128;&#147; along the lines of recent â&#128;&#156;stress testingâ&#128;? of banks to&#13;
evaluate how they would perform under unforeseen circumstances. Box C5.2 shows a&#13;

project.&#13;

&#13;
In a scenario assessment, we define plausible best and worst cases across the range of variables&#13;
identified in the risk assessment. By plausible worst case we mean a set of unfavourable outcomes&#13;
as have been experienced at many hydro projects â&#128;&#147; but excluding catastrophic force majeure events&#13;
(such as earthquakes or war damage). Similarly the plausible best case reflects events â&#128;&#147; such as&#13;
higher than expected oil prices and higher efficiency increment - that fall into the range of&#13;
plausible scenarios. These scenarios are summarised in the table below: the values are based on&#13;
the discussion of risk factors in the risk assessment.&#13;

&#13;
84.     However, the approach offers more important insights than merely identifying&#13;
the impacts of an unfavourable future: it can offer key insights into how the proposed&#13;
project performs against alternatives â&#128;&#147; whose performance may also vary as a function&#13;
of unknown futures. A renewable energy project may be the correct choice against gas&#13;
CCGT if, as expected, gas prices remain unchanged or if they rise: but if gas prices fall&#13;
(as has happened in North America), then CCGT would be the better choice. In other&#13;
words, what is of interest is what are the consequences of making the wrong choice.&#13;
&#13;
85.      A robust investment decision is one that is relatively insensitive to uncertain&#13;
futures. And it may well be the case that the (best) project with the lowest expected&#13;
value under baseline assumptions proves to be more sensitive to assumptions than a&#13;
second ranked alternative, which may have lower expected value but which is&#13;
insensitive to uncertainty â&#128;&#147; and is more robust.&#13;

&#13;
Box C5.3: Risk v. return in renewable energy tariff-setting&#13;
The reality of the risk-reward relationship is rarely confronted in the design of renewable energy&#13;
feed-in tariffs that are based on estimated production costs. The presumption is that such a FIT&#13;
should be set at a level that covers costs plus a â&#128;&#156;reasonableâ&#128;? rate of return: but the presumption&#13;
that the risks of all projects in a particular technology category are equal is doubtful. Nor is it clear&#13;
that Governments are in a position to accurately assess what are the relevant production costs â&#128;&#147;&#13;
even when extensive public consultations are provided (as in the Philippines), where developers&#13;
and DoE each proposed their own assumptions for key variables, the final result will rarely please&#13;
anyone. Worse, in order to avoid the possibility of â&#128;&#156;windfallâ&#128;? profits, such tariffs are often finely&#13;
differentiated by size of project, or (as in Germany) by the estimated annual capacity factor.&#13;
Arbitrary bonuses for characteristics deemed to have special value to Government, and arbitrary&#13;
rates of â&#128;?degressionâ&#128;? (supposedly to incentivise early investment), further complicate the tariff.&#13;
&#13;
Such tariff structures should not be encouraged by the Bank. If tariffs are finely differentiated by&#13;
capacity factor, the result is to incentivise projects in areas of poor resource. In Germany they&#13;
were introduced expressly as a measure to share the burden of wind integration among regions&#13;
(since most of the capacity was located in the Northwest where wind regimes are the best). But&#13;
that is a luxury of the rich: in developing countries, where OPSPQ insists that the development&#13;
outcome has primacy, tariffs should be structured to encourage development of the least cost&#13;
renewable energy resource.&#13;
&#13;
These problems are of course avoided when feed-in tariffs are set on the basis of benefits - as in&#13;
the case of the new Indonesia geothermal tariff, the Vietnam renewable energy tariff, or the Sri&#13;
Lanka renewable energy tariff (1997-2010).&#13;

&#13;
Best practice recommendations 2: Risk assessment&#13;
(1) In a project appraisal, the first task is to make sure that significant risks as identified&#13;
in the PAD Risk Matrix have been adequately examined in the economic risk&#13;
assessment. It is not always possible for these to be quantified and their impact on the&#13;
economic returns evaluated â&#128;&#147; but in such cases where such quantification is straight&#13;
forward (as for example in the case of high risk of construction delays), inclusion in the&#13;
economic risk assessment is mandatory. Indeed, such an analysis will assist in the&#13;
identification of any residual risks (after mitigation) as may remain.&#13;
&#13;
(2) Whether a formal Monte Carlo assessment, scenario analysis or one of the techniques&#13;
discussed in Technical Note C4 are required depends on the scale of the project.&#13;
Certainly where any single investment is greater than $25 million a quantitative risk&#13;
assessment is desirable, but even for smaller projects (and emergency power projects) at&#13;
the very least a scenario analysis should examine the consequences of unfavourable&#13;
futures (as illustrated in the example of the Tarakhil diesel station in Afghanistan). 30&#13;

&#13;
C6      DISTRIBUTIONAL ANALYSIS&#13;
&#13;
86.      The purpose of a distributional analysis is to demonstrate how a proposed&#13;
policy, or a proposed project, affects the various stakeholders, and how the total net&#13;
economic benefits are shared â&#128;&#147; which in effect requires a reconciliation of economic and&#13;
financial flows. In a CBA, transfer payments are netted out, and do not appear in the&#13;
table of economic flows that is focused on the question of net economic benefits to the&#13;
country. Indeed, whether the net economic benefits can be realised at all may well&#13;
depend upon the credibility of the recovery of incremental costs â&#128;&#147; which are the financial&#13;
transactions necessary to realise the economic benefits. The OPSPQ guidelines are quite&#13;
clear that an assessment of the financial sustainability of projects must be demonstrated.&#13;
&#13;
87.     Who pays for these costs is often the central question, and one that our review of&#13;
recent renewable energy project appraisals shows is rarely clear â&#128;&#147; in particular what&#13;
proportion of the incremental costs is bought down by concessional financing, and what&#13;
remains to be recovered from Government and consumers. The stark reality is that&#13;
highly concessional funds like CTF are in short supply, and even when blended in with&#13;
IDA and IBRD, in the case of high cost renewables such as CSP a significant portion of&#13;
the incremental cost passes to consumers (or Government). When the implicit costs of&#13;
avoided carbon are calculated, these prove to be not just a multiple of what developed&#13;
country entities are paying for carbon on global carbon markets, but even a multiple of&#13;
the valuation now proposed by the World Bank for the global social cost of carbon.&#13;
&#13;
88.     How to structure a distributional analysis is best shown by example, of which&#13;
we here present two. The first example relates to a policy question: should the&#13;
Government of Indonesia issue a feed-in tariff for rooftop PV in Jakarta, and for wind in&#13;
Sulawesi. The second example shows how the distributional analysis can easily be&#13;
incorporated in a standard economic and financial analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THE MATRIX FORMAT FOR DISTRIBUTIONAL ANALYSIS&#13;
89.     This example illustrates one approach to distributional analysis for a proposed&#13;
renewable energy policy â&#128;&#147; namely whether Indonesia should issue a feed-in tariff to&#13;
support a rooftop solar PV program in Jakarta. The recommended approach to answer&#13;
such a question rests on two main inputs: what are the costs of a rooftop solar PV&#13;
program, and what are the benefits. The first question was relatively straight-forward:&#13;
based on current module prices, assembly process, and other factors that determine the&#13;
cost of delivering such installations, it was determined that a feed-in tariff based on&#13;
production costs would need to be around 25USc/kWh. 31&#13;
&#13;
90.     In 2014, Indonesia adopted the principle that feed-in tariffs (and ceiling tariffs&#13;
where larger projects are competitively tendered) should be based on benefits. In the&#13;
case of Rooftop PV, the benefits were assessed as shown in Table C6.1.32 Column [2]&#13;
multiplies the USc/kWh by the estimated energy contribution in 2024: thus PLN â&#128;&#147; the&#13;
Indonesian power utility â&#128;&#147; would avoid $41.2 million/year in gas costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
31      The proposed tariff was graduated according to size of installation, ranging from 20&#13;
        USc/kWh for the largest 1MW to 30USc/kWh for small household scale systems. A range&#13;
        of other issues was also discussed in the report (such as net or gross metering) these are&#13;
        details that can be viewed in the report.&#13;
32      The methodology was developed in 2014: see World Bank and ADB, Unlocking Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
        Geothermal Potential, May 2015. The example is extracted from the subsequent report on&#13;

92.      Row[14] passes through the incremental financial costs of PLN either to MoF&#13;
(the situation in the past, under which MoF provided whatever was necessary to cover&#13;
the gap between revenue requirements and customer revenue), or as shown here to the&#13;
consumer (under the new cost-reflective tariff, under which purchases of renewable&#13;
energy are a pass-through), so that the net impact of the FIT on PLN is zero: as a&#13;
transfer payment, this does not therefore appear in column [8] that represents the net&#13;
economic benefits.&#13;
&#13;
93.      Thus, in column [2], PLN benefits from $41.2 in avoided fuel costs (row[3]), and&#13;
$2.8 million in avoided T&amp;D losses â&#128;&#147; but the cost of the FIT (at the assumed 25 USc/kWh&#13;
is $76.7 million â&#128;&#147; for a net loss of $32.7 million â&#128;&#147; which here is shown as being passed&#13;
onto consumers (as a surcharge on the tariff). So despite the GHG benefits ($4.3 million)&#13;
- assigned to the global community â&#128;&#147; the net loss economic benefit is -$21.7 million. To&#13;
the extent that these costs are not passed to consumers, but absorbed by MoF under the&#13;
established subsidy mechanism, then the additional subsidy requirement on MoF is&#13;
$32.7million.&#13;
&#13;
94.     To make a Jakarta Rooftop program economic would require a societal valuation&#13;
of avoided carbon of 143$/ton CO2, which is significantly above the generally accepted&#13;
social cost of carbon of $30/ton CO2, as also used in the geothermal tariff. From the&#13;
perspective of the consumer, who sees the total financial incremental cost to PLN passed&#13;
onto the consumer bill, the effective cost is $179/ton CO2 .&#13;

&#13;
95.     However, though PV is uneconomic where it replaces gas, PV is highly&#13;
economic when it replaces oil. A 25USc/kWh production cost based FIT for PV where&#13;
the cost of oil-based generation (high speed diesel and marine fuel oil) is 26-30&#13;
USc/kWh, results in financial cost savings to PLN: as shown in Table C6.4, for such&#13;
application of PV, there is a net economic benefit of $17.1m per year (in 2024).&#13;
&#13;
96.     Indeed, this is the classic â&#128;&#156;win-winâ&#128;? strategy â&#128;&#147; as is clear from the diagram, all&#13;
stakeholders experience a net benefit. Here the assumption is that the savings to PLN are&#13;
passed to consumers in the form of lower tariffs (which would indeed be the consequence&#13;
of a cost-reflective tariff). In effect, this is an option under which carbon emissions are&#13;
achieved at no cost to the Indonesian consumer: another example of a win-win result for&#13;
a renewable energy investment.&#13;

EXAMPLE FROM INDONESIA: DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPACT OF GEOTHERMAL PROJECTS&#13;
97.      Another example from Indonesia presents a similar analysis for the impact of&#13;
geothermal energy.33 Here the allocations of financial &amp; economic costs and benefits,&#13;
and of externalities, were calculated for the geothermal projects in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Indonesia&#13;
Geothermal Investment Project,34 evaluated against the coal projects that they would&#13;
replace â&#128;&#147; a valid comparison since both provide base load power. As shown in Table&#13;
C6.5, the incremental financial contribution of concessionary CTF financing (NPV&#13;
$86million) is offset against the global externality of $160 million (valued here at&#13;
$30/ton CO2). However, one sees that the financial loss to government ($74million) is&#13;
offset by a net gain on local health impacts of $45 million, so the net result is that the&#13;
Government of Indonesia (now the electricity consumers, since tariffs will become fully&#13;
cost-reflective following the tariff reforms of 2014) is funding $29 million of the GHG&#13;
benefits that accrue to the global community. 35&#13;

Best practice recommendations 3: Distributional analysis&#13;
(1) The OPSPQ guidelines (see Table 1.1) do not mandate a distributional analysis â&#128;&#147; but&#13;
simply require that the economist assess whether a distributional analysis is â&#128;&#156;relevant to&#13;
the careful determination of social cost and benefitsâ&#128;?. However, it would be very rare&#13;
for a power sector investment project to have no significant distributional impacts, and&#13;
best practice would require a minimal distributional analysis for almost all projects.&#13;

&#13;
C7       ENERGY SECURITY&#13;
&#13;
98.      Energy Security is a widely announced objective of public policy. One of the&#13;
main difficulties is that energy security is difficult to define, and therefore difficult to&#13;
balance against other policy objectives. Definitions range from broad statements of&#13;
policy to definitions that equate energy security to freedom from imports (and in&#13;
particular, as in the example of the US, freedom from oil imports), or to robustness to&#13;
physical supply disruptions, and, more recently, to robustness against cyber-threats.36&#13;
However, as noted by the eminent MIT economist Paul Joskow, â&#128;&#156; There is one thing that&#13;
has not changed since the early 1970s. If you cannot think of a reasoned rationale for some policy&#13;
based on standard economic reasoning, then argue that the policy is necessary to promote â&#128;&#156;energy&#13;
security.â&#128;?37&#13;
&#13;
99.      The breadth of energy security concerns is reflected in the following sample of&#13;
Government concerns:&#13;
ï&#130;· The UK Government in 1912: Arguably the first example of an expressly&#13;
    announced energy security policy, Winston Churchill, famously noted that â&#128;&#156; We must&#13;
    become the owners or at any rate the controllers at the source of at least a proportion of the oil&#13;
    which we requireâ&#128;? â&#128;&#147; a view that led eventually led to the creation of Iraq under British&#13;
    control after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1918. 38&#13;
ï&#130;· International Energy Agency: defines energy security as uninterrupted physical&#13;
    availability at a price which is affordable, while respecting environmental concerns: Energy&#13;
    security has many aspects: long-term energy security mainly deals with timely investments&#13;
    to supply energy in line with economic developments and environmental needs. On the other&#13;
    hand, short-term energy security focuses on the ability of the energy system to react promptly&#13;
    to sudden changes in the supply-demand balance. 39&#13;
ï&#130;· The Government of Saudi Arabia in 2012: the commitment to large scale&#13;
    development of concentrated solar power (CSP) reflects not just its excellent solar&#13;
    regime, and opportunity to become a global leader in a new industry, but the need&#13;
    to hedge the vulnerability of the Saudi oil infrastructure and the vulnerability of its&#13;
    oil exports to blockade of the Straits of Hormuz. 40&#13;
ï&#130;· The Government of Nepal in the 1990s: the goal of energy sufficiency was&#13;
    articulated on grounds of its rich hydro resource, and that Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s energy policy&#13;
    should build hydro projects and export the hydro surplus to India, rather than rely&#13;
    on electricity imports from India whose Eastern provinces at the time had a surplus&#13;
    of coal-fired capacity, suitable for export as base-load. While electricity self-&#13;
&#13;
36       There are increasing reports of attacks on control systems of public utilities, and attempts&#13;
         by hackers to break into systems controlling natural gas pipelines (see, e.g., Financial&#13;
         Times Special Report on Cyber Security, 6 June 2014). Cyber attacks on industrial control&#13;
         systems reported to the US Department of Homeland Security have increased from 34 in&#13;
         2010 to 257 in 2013: most remain unreported. On August 15, 2012, the â&#128;&#156;shamoonâ&#128;? virus&#13;
         cyber-attack deleted data on three quarters of Aramcoâ&#128;&#153;s corporate computers.&#13;

         US Association of Energy Economics, 17(2) August.&#13;
38       History records the emergence of energy security as a major policy problem for&#13;
         Government in the conversion of the British Royal Navy from coal to oil first proposed in&#13;
         1882 (by the then Captain, subsequently First Lord of the Admiralty Fisher). The problem&#13;
         was that while Britain had coal, it had no oil, which needed to be secured from the&#13;
         Middle East â&#128;&#147; a fact that shaped (and held hostage) British foreign policy for the next 50&#13;
         years.&#13;

&#13;
     sufficiency was largely attained, the result of the reluctance to see energy trade as a&#13;
     two-way opportunity resulted in no progress in exporting hydro power, and&#13;
     endemic power shortages, particularly because an almost all-hydro system was&#13;
     exposed to increasing hydrology risk.41 (This posture changed following the power&#13;
     shortage crisis of 2008: the World Bank is now financing a major 400 kV transmission&#13;
     link between India (Bihar) and Nepal) to accommodate transfers of up to 1,000&#13;
     MW)42&#13;
ï&#130;·    The United States in 2011: The March 2011 speech of President Obama articulated&#13;
     Americaâ&#128;&#153;s energy security problem as freedom from oil imports â&#128;&#156; . . .there are no quick&#13;
     fixes. We will keep on being a victim to shifts in the oil market until we get serious about a&#13;
     long-term policy for secure, affordable energy . . . The United States of America cannot afford&#13;
     to bet our long-term prosperity and security on a resource that will eventually run out . . . So&#13;
     today, Iâ&#128;&#153;m setting a new goal: one that is reasonable, achievable, and necessary. When I was&#13;
     elected to this office, America imported 11 million barrels of oil a day. By a little more than a&#13;
     decade from now, we will have cut that by one-thirdâ&#128;?.43 In fact by 2013 US oil imports&#13;
     had already fallen by half - albeit less as a consequence of new Federal Government&#13;
     policies as much as by the private sector-led fracking technology revolution.&#13;
ï&#130;·     UK Government in 2011: Consumers should â&#128;&#156;have access to the energy services&#13;
     they need (physical security) at prices that avoid excessive volatility (price security),&#13;
     and delivered alongside achievement of our legally binding targets on carbon&#13;
     emissions and renewable energyâ&#128;? 44&#13;
ï&#130;·    Afghanistan in 2015: At a May 2015 workshop on power sector planning, the main&#13;
     priority was articulated with brevity and focus: â&#128;&#156;The people need powerâ&#128;? â&#128;&#147; a reflection&#13;
     of the need for economic development and the concomitant need for electricity as&#13;
     the main option for improving the long-term prospects to emerge from the current&#13;
     state of internal conflict., If that means that over the short- to medium term the bulk&#13;
     of electricity has to be imported from Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, then so be it:&#13;
     the geopolitical risks of dependency on just one or two import suppliers are seen as&#13;
     much less important. (see also Box C7.1).&#13;
&#13;
100.    The diversity of these energy security issues underscores the fact that there is no&#13;
one-size-fits-all definition: greater import dependency is seen as desirable by some,&#13;
highly undesirable by others. More importantly, what can usefully be quantified and&#13;
monetised will vary greatly form country to country.&#13;
&#13;
101.       It is often asserted that a higher share of renewable energy improves energy&#13;
security,45 and that this benefit is not captured by conventional cost-benefit analysis.&#13;
Such arguments are most often heard in connection with high-cost renewable energy&#13;
projects whose economic returns â&#128;&#147; even when global carbon externalities are included â&#128;&#147;&#13;
still fail to meet the required hurdle rate. If these energy security benefits (together with&#13;

In Afghanistan, the energy security of the country is demonstrably linked to energy access, and to&#13;
grid electricity access at affordable prices in particular. Yet in the past five years, electricity supply&#13;
to Afghanistan has relied on a massive increase in imports from Uzbekistan: imports during the&#13;
winter peak demand months rose from 33% in 2006 to 81% in 2011.&#13;

Evidently the potential risk of supply disruption from the main supplier Uzbekistan has been&#13;
judged small compared to the (economic) costs of no power at all, or power from diesels also&#13;
dependent upon imported fuel (and whose cost is 25-30 USc/kWh rather than the 3-6 USÂ¢/kWh&#13;
for imported electricity).&#13;
&#13;
However, the ability to further increase imports from Uzbekistan is unclear, and given the various&#13;
geopolitical imperatives of the region, the Government has now created a new Planning Cell in the&#13;
Ministry of Energy and Water, for whom alternatives to imports has been identified as a pressing&#13;
policy issue.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THE ISSUES&#13;
102.    Notwithstanding the difficulties of definition, there is general consensus that&#13;
energy security is primarily about the resilience of the energy system to risks and&#13;
uncertainty. Most discussions distinguish between long and short-term threats, and&#13;
between physical security and price security, a classification depicted in Table C7.1.&#13;
&#13;
103.    Note that many of these risk factors are beyond the ability of decision-makers in&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s typically relatively small client countries to control. The pa ce of global&#13;
climate change will be determined largely by the ability of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s major GHG&#13;
emitters to reach agreement on global measures. Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s rise â&#128;&#147; which has had a major&#13;
impact on rising fossil fuel prices â&#128;&#147; is an inescapable reality that the world must simply&#13;
accept. But government decision-makers can improve the resilience of energy systems to&#13;
absorb price shocks by&#13;

104.    These attributes will largely determine the costs of the risks enumerated in Table&#13;
C7.1, and of the cost of measures to mitigate them. But these are the principal subject of&#13;
energy policy, rather than characteristics of individual projects.&#13;
&#13;
Energy Security in Policy assessment v. project appraisal&#13;
105.     In a policy assessment, the energy security question is how to make the energy&#13;
system more resilient to the wide range of risks. So the first task is to select some set of&#13;
indicators that measures resilience (diversity of supply sources, energy intensity of GDP,&#13;
discussed further below) (as an example, see Box C7.2 that looks at the reduction in oil&#13;
intensity (mbd/$GDP), that has dramatically enhanced US energy security). The&#13;
portfolio of options with which RE must compete is often large - reduce fossil fuel&#13;
subsidies, electricity tariff reform, energy efficiency, thermal rehab, etc - each of which&#13;
will have some place in the triangle of major objectives (economic efficiency (indictor&#13;
NPV), low carbon development (indicator lifetime GHG) and energy security (say&#13;
diversity index of supply sources). Many may not be mutually exclusive alternatives -&#13;
the best strategy may well involve several measures.&#13;
&#13;
106.     In a CBA, the reality is that energy security, however defined, is not likely to be a&#13;
significant component of the table of economic flows that can be monetised and included&#13;
in the table of economic flows. The few studies that have attempted this demonstrate&#13;
very small benefits, typically &lt;0.1 USc/kWh. The only practical approach is scenario&#13;
analysis, in which the impacts of given assumptions about more or less energy security&#13;
are explicitly costed.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                      Box C7.2: Strategic oil reserve v. energy intensity of GDP&#13;
There is no better example of the importance of long-term policies to improve system resilience&#13;
than the US response to the first oil crisis of 1973. One of the policies to reduce exposure to oil&#13;
price disruptions and oil price volatility was the establishment of a strategic petroleum reserve&#13;
(SPR)46 â&#128;&#147; along the lines suggested by the IEA target for its member countries to provide for at&#13;
least 90 days of physical storage capacity for imported oil. In practice the SPR has been used only&#13;
three times with just relatively small sales (in 1991 during the first Gulf War; in September 2005&#13;
after the disruption to oil production in the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and&#13;
in June 2011 in connection with the disruptions in Libya). Even if rarely used, the very existence&#13;
of such a reserve serves as a deterrent, and even limited sales serve to calm markets.&#13;
&#13;
However, the ability to withstand oil embargoes and external price shocks is far more influenced&#13;
by the oil and gas intensity of the US economy, as shown in the table below: 2005 was the year of&#13;
peak oil imports, which have fallen significantly in the last 8 years as US production has increased.&#13;
Actual oil imports today are just 6.2 mbd (million barrels per day). Oil intensity has fallen from 2.7&#13;
mbd/trillion$ GDP to just 0.9 mbd/trillion$GDP in 2013. If the oil intensity had remained at the&#13;
1975 level, and if domestic oil production were also unchanged, 2013 oil imports would be at 34.4&#13;
mbd, almost six times higher! The implications of such a level of oil imports for US foreign policy,&#13;
for its trade balance, and for global oil prices, would obviously be dramatic.&#13;

&#13;
That said, the reduction in US energy intensity was also strongly influenced by changes in the&#13;
sectoral composition of GDP due to a shift of energy intensive manufacturing to other countries,&#13;
particularly to China.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THE LITERATURE: ENERGY SECURITY AND RISK47&#13;
107.     Some dimensions of risk have long been incorporated into power sector&#13;
planning: quantification of hydrology risk and reliability of power systems are&#13;
established features of widely used power system planning models such as WASP and&#13;
EGEAS. From this follows the easiest quantification of energy insecurity as the expected&#13;
quantity of unserved energy in a power system. This is straight forward to incorporate&#13;
into the objective functions of power system planning models by assigning a (high) cost&#13;
to this unserved energy, and by stipulating some level of reliability (e.g., as loss of load&#13;
probability). Yet few if any power system planning studies present a clear analysis of&#13;
the trade-offs between system cost and the reliability criteria and cost of unserved&#13;
energy exogenously specified by engineers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
46       This has a capacity of 727 million barrels, the largest such reserve in the world, and&#13;
         sufficient for 72 days of annual imports to the US (at the peak import level of 2007).&#13;

&#13;
108.     What is conspicuously absent from this literature is the impact of price volatility&#13;
for fossil fuels. Most power systems planning studies do indeed present results for&#13;
different forecasts of long term trends in international fossil fuel prices (which addresses&#13;
two of the risks enumerated in Table C7.1: the impact of resource depletion and changes&#13;
in global supply and demand). But that says nothing about the impact of short term&#13;
price volatility.&#13;
&#13;
109.     Translating price volatility impacts into a risk premium that could be built into&#13;
CBA is difficult, and rarely attempted. A recent study for Latin America by the Inter-&#13;
American Development Bank48 suggests the risk premium to be very small, (0.01&#13;
USc/kWh), an order of magnitude lower than, say, the damage costs from local air&#13;
pollution of thermal generation. Another recent study to develop an avoided cost&#13;
renewable energy tariff for Indonesian geothermal projects 49 estimates the volatility&#13;
premium at 0.07 USc/kWh (estimated as the cost to Ministry of Finance of short-term&#13;
financing of unexpected increased subsidy to PLN as a result of volatility induced&#13;
forecasting errors of coal prices).&#13;
&#13;
110.     Another strand of the relevant literature is to cast renewable energy as a hedge&#13;
against fossil fuel price volatility, as first proposed by Auerbuch.50 He argued that the&#13;
role of renewable energy projects in a portfolio of generating projects was akin to the&#13;
role of essentially risk-free treasuries in a financial portfolio. The application of mean-&#13;
variance portfolio theory is useful but one must be careful not to overstate the case: wind&#13;
projects in particular may have high annual variability due to wind speed variations â&#128;&#147;&#13;
though because this risk is uncorrelated with the factors that drive fossil fuel price&#13;
variability, it can still serve as a hedge (for further details of this approach, see Technical&#13;
Note M8)&#13;
&#13;
111.    The general theme of renewable energy as a hedge against fossil price&#13;
uncertainty has been taken up by Bolinger and others at the US Lawrence Berkeley&#13;
National Laboratory.51 This work argues that â&#128;&#147; at least in the US where futures markets&#13;
for natural gas are well developed â&#128;&#147; renewable energy can be a cost-effective hedge&#13;
when compared to futures hedging (a finding that is still valid at the currently low US&#13;
gas prices).52 However, sophisticated oil-price hedging strategies for small developing&#13;
countries are to be recommended only with great caution (Sri Lankaâ&#128;&#153;s recent attempts to&#13;
do so were an unmitigated disaster, with losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars). 53&#13;
&#13;
THE LITERATURE: ENERGY SECURITY AND RESILIENCE&#13;
112.    Many definitions of energy resilience are based on simple indicators, ranging&#13;
from the simple fraction of imports in oil supply (much used in the US) to more&#13;
sophisticated numerical indicators of diversity of supply (under the presumption that&#13;
greater diversity implies better energy security). The most common indicator of supply&#13;
diversity (or generation mix diversity in the case of the power sector) is the Herfindahl&#13;

&#13;
Index, a measure used originally to assess the degree of concentration and competition&#13;
of firms in industrial sectors. The (dimensionless) index H calculates simply as the sum&#13;
of squares of the market or generation mix shares s for each of the n shares as follows:&#13;
        H ï&#128;½ ï&#131;¥ si2&#13;
               n&#13;
113.     The lower the value of H the greater the diversity of fuels. In estimating&#13;
diversification of supply by this approach, if there were only one fuel the index is 1, if&#13;
there are ten fuels of the same size the index is 0.1. The shares are best expressed as&#13;
installed capacity shares rather than energy shares. Obviously, introducing new&#13;
renewable energy forms into a power system will increase such diversity, but whether&#13;
greater diversity necessarily improves energy security is not always true (see Box C7.2).&#13;
This can also questioned in the case of energy efficiency improvements: all other things&#13;
equal, T&amp;D loss reduction or energy efficiency will reduce the need for supply, and&#13;
leave its mix (and hence its H-index) unchanged â&#128;&#147; but the resilience of the economy&#13;
(measured per unit of GDP) will surely improve.&#13;
&#13;
114.     In the economics literature itself the emphasis of energy security discussions â&#128;&#147;&#13;
particularly since the mid 1970s â&#128;&#147; is on the macroeconomic impacts of oil price shocks.&#13;
Bohi and others54 summarise much of the early work (and define energy insecurity as the&#13;
loss of welfare that may occur as a result of a change in the price or availability of energy ); Tang&#13;
and others55 examine the impact of oil price shocks on the Chinese Economy; and&#13;
Ebrahim and others56 et al. (2014) 57 assess the macroeconomic consequences of oil price&#13;
volatility - all typical examples of a still-growing literature. Much of this work is&#13;
focussed on the asymmetries of oil price shocks (the costs of sharp oil price rises â&#128;&#147;&#13;
including inflation and recession - are not matched by the benefits of any subsequent&#13;
price falls): it is the price and consequent macroeconomic impacts, rather than&#13;
curtailments in physical supply, that is the main concern. This is complemented by a&#13;
substantial World Bank literature that deals with strategies to mitigate the impacts of oil&#13;
price shocks in developing countries (both importers and exporters). 58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
World Bank Practice&#13;
115.     Despite the many qualitative assertions of the additional benefits to energy&#13;
security, no renewable energy project appraisals have successfully quantified such&#13;
benefits, and included them in the CBA economic flows. Nor has there been any&#13;
detailed study or research paper on the subject in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s literature. There is one&#13;
study currently underway that directly confronts the question of how to incorporate&#13;
energy security questions in energy planning in situations of high uncertainty (typical of&#13;
post-conflict countries), but its results will be forthcoming only in late 2015.59&#13;

116.     As noted, the Bank has published several assessments of the vulnerability of oil&#13;
importing countries, but this focuses on better understanding, and quantification of&#13;
energy system resilience, rather than quantifying the benefits of specific projects. In&#13;
short, the Bank does not yet have a satisfactory answer to whether and how energy&#13;
security concerns should be addressed in the CBA of projects.&#13;

Best practice recommendations 4: Energy Security&#13;
With so few satisfactory examples of integrating energy security concerns into CBA, it is&#13;
as yet difficult to define what constitutes best practice.&#13;
&#13;
(1) In the first instance it is important to avoid false arguments: avoid an assertion of&#13;
energy security as an important policy concern for which there exists nothing more than&#13;
anecdotal evidence. It is claimed, for example, that RE will improve energy security&#13;
because a country will then be less vulnerable to physical supply disruptions for&#13;
imported fossil fuels. But can it be shown that the Government has examined other&#13;
alternatives to address this same concern - that would be proposed even if RE were not&#13;
an option -â&#128;&#147; for example, by mandating increased physical storage (say an extra 30 days&#13;
coal supply to be stockpiled at coal projects), or by financial hedging of fuel prices?&#13;
&#13;
(2) One should resist the temptation to double count. It is often (and correctly) stated&#13;
that Governments are determined to increase renewable energy â&#128;&#147; even if more expensive&#13;
- in order to diminish the impact of the macroeconomic shocks of the last run-up in&#13;
imported oil prices. But the benefit of reducing oil (or gas) imports is already captured&#13;
in the CBA of the renewable energy project: the benefit would be even greater if fossil&#13;
fuel prices were to increase above the baseline forecast. So why should there be an&#13;
additional benefit called â&#128;&#156;energy securityâ&#128;??&#13;
&#13;
(3) Scenario analysis (see example above) appears to be the easiest way to deal with&#13;
country specific energy security concerns. This requires that the consequence of physical&#13;
disruptions that are assumed in alternative scenarios be costed out â&#128;&#147; for example, in case&#13;
of accidents (powerhouse flooding, transmission substation failure, coal supply&#13;
disruption) considering not just the cost of repairs, but the value of lost production.&#13;

T1        VARIABLE RENEWABLE ENERGY&#13;
&#13;
117.     Variable renewable energy (VRE) may bring substantial incremental costs to the&#13;
buyer beyond the direct cost of power at the point of generation. Three main issues&#13;
arise:&#13;
ï&#130;· The incremental costs of transmission (discussed in Technical Note T2): renewables&#13;
     are tied to the location of their natural resource, which are often more distant from&#13;
     load centres than the thermal generation they replace: significant additional&#13;
     transmission investments may be required.&#13;
ï&#130;· The capacity value of renewables: simply stated, how much thermal capacity is&#13;
     replaced by an additional MW of variable renewable energy capacity.&#13;
ï&#130;· The impacts on the operation of the system: ranging from heat rate degradation of&#13;
     thermal units that are pushed into part-load operation when backed down to absorb&#13;
     variable renewable generation, to questions of network stability.&#13;
&#13;
118.     As noted in the main text, the latter subject is not always easy for non-engineers&#13;
and economists advising on renewable energy support tariffs, or having to make&#13;
allowance for integration costs in a CBA: utilities with no experience with renewables&#13;
will often raise a long list of issues as to why the integration of variable renewables will&#13;
create both technical difficulties and incremental costs.&#13;
&#13;
119.     An important mitigant to the problems of variability is generation portfolio&#13;
diversification. A single wind turbine may have no capacity value, but a portfolio of&#13;
wind farms or small hydro projects over a larger region, or a portfolio of different&#13;
renewable energy projects (say wind and small hydro), can smooth out the aggregate&#13;
variability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IMPACT ON OPERATING COSTS&#13;
120.     The ability of thermal and storage hydro projects to absorb variation from&#13;
renewable energy projects is subject to a range of economic, technical and environmental&#13;
constraints. The allowable rate of change of output is termed the ramping rate, which&#13;
varies from technology to technology: Table T1.1 shows typical rates for a CCGT&#13;
&#13;
                         Table T1.1: Typical operating limits for a CCGT&#13;

     of load change                             (full range of output)   (from 50% to100% of output)&#13;

&#13;
Hydro constraints&#13;
121.    Very rapid ramp rates are possible technically, but are often constrained by&#13;
environmental requirements that take the form of maximum rates of change of&#13;
downstream water levels. Pumped storage projects are generally less constrained in this&#13;
regard, and are therefore the ideal form of generation to absorb the variations from&#13;
variable output renewables.       But at conventional storage hydro projects, the&#13;
environmental restrictions can be significant. At the Bank-financed 240 MW Trung Son&#13;
hydro project in Vietnam, the maximum rate of increase was determined to be 40 cumecs&#13;
per hour. This implied an 11-12 hour period to increase from the minimum turbine&#13;
discharge of 63 cumecs to the maximum of 504 cumecs â&#128;&#147; which limits the proportion of&#13;
&#13;

the total energy available during peak hours. Figure T1.1 shows the ramping curve used&#13;
in the reservoir simulation runs that provided the input to the economic analysis.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
122.     In this case, the ramping constraint is much more severe than applies to gas fired&#13;
project: a typical open cycle combustion turbine can ramp up at 8% of its capacity per&#13;
minute, so just a few minutes, rather than hours, to reach full capacity.&#13;
&#13;
123.    The impact of such ramping constraints should be discussed in the economic&#13;
analysis of hydro projects. In the case of the Trung Son project, the impact of these&#13;
ramping constraints on ERR is a few percentage points (lower): the economic benefits of&#13;
simply displacing the energy from thermal alternative without any capacity benefit were&#13;
substantially above the hurdle rate.   In short, such ramping constraints on hydro&#13;
projects should be studied in the CBA, and the impact demonstrated in the sensitivity&#13;
analysis.&#13;
&#13;
Thermal projects&#13;
124.     At thermal projects, ramping constraints vary across technologies. Frequent&#13;
changes in load, or operation at part load, often associated with increased VRE, will&#13;
affect average heat rates. Load following may be technically possible, but it may affect&#13;
not just average heat rates, but also result in higher O&amp;M costs, and more frequent&#13;
intervals for technical overhauls.&#13;
&#13;
125.     The operating costs imposed on the buyer of variable energy (notably wind and&#13;
PV) include the following:60&#13;
ï&#130;· Increased O&amp;M costs at existing thermal units called upon to ramp output levels&#13;
     over a broader range and more often and with shorter notice.&#13;
ï&#130;· The heat rate penalties (and related fuel costs) associated with such increased&#13;
     ramping (different fossil technologies experience different rates of heat rate penalties&#13;
     and incremental O&amp;M costs).&#13;
ï&#130;· Regulation costs (that arise from the intra-hour variability of wind resources that&#13;
     requires additional fast response capacity be available).&#13;
ï&#130;· Systems operations cost, that arise from less than optimal operation of the system as&#13;
     a consequence of the uncertain nature of wind energy production: the total reserve&#13;
     margin may need to increase by a few percentage points in the presence of highly&#13;
     variable renewables.&#13;
ï&#130;· Gas storage costs (that arise from inaccuracies in the amount of gas nominated each&#13;
     day, which may require the need to inject or withdraw gas from storage at short&#13;
     notice)&#13;

&#13;
   ï&#130;·    Gas supply take-or-pay penalties: Under certain circumstances, wind incurs not only&#13;
        the cycling costs of the gas turbines when these are ramped down; but if these gas&#13;
        projects then need to increase generation during off-peak hours to meet take-or-pay&#13;
        requirements, then coal projects will be backed down at night to make way for that,&#13;
        incurring a second set of cycling costs - with the result that variable renewable&#13;
        energy in fact displaces coal).61&#13;
&#13;
   126.     The most detailed analysis of power plant cycling costs is a 2012 study by&#13;

   aero-derivative combustion turbines have by far the lowest costs, and coal projects the&#13;

    127.    The practical significance of these issues is reflected in PPAs for CCGT IPPs,&#13;
   wherein the deviations from full-load operation are expressly compensated.           For&#13;
   example, the PPA for the Phu My 715 MW CCGT requires compensation for the number&#13;
   of hot and cold startups in excess of the contracted annual number, 63 and adjustments to&#13;
   the fuel charge for any time in part-load operation (Table T1.3).&#13;

   61        This is the case in Indonesia, where PLN argues that take-or-pay gas supply contracts&#13;
             would force such a result (and since coal costs $4/mmBTU and gas $10-15$/mmBTU, this&#13;
             makes wind quite uneconomic). Such undesirable outcomes may be unlikely for small&#13;
             penetrations of wind that can more easily be accommodated by just a minimum flexibility&#13;
             in gas supply contracts. However, it points to the importance of the necessary breadth of&#13;
             issues when designing a renewable energy policy.&#13;

   63        The PPA provides compensation of $18,540 for each hot-start and $50,000 for each cold&#13;
             start (and indexed for escalation over the duration of the PPA) when the number of hot&#13;
             and cold startups per year exceed 30. Such clauses are common in thermal PPAs, and&#13;
             reflecting the incremental costs of deviations from optimal dispatch.&#13;

     128.    System integration studies that try to predict the impact of wind on a given grid&#13;
     often suffer from the lack of first-hand data: and a utility with no experience with wind&#13;
     will inevitably be sceptical. Unfortunately there are very few real case studies that have&#13;
     examined several years of operating experience in any detail, in part because there are&#13;
     few places that have extensive and successful experience with small wind-diesel hybrids.&#13;
&#13;
     129.     Cape Verde is one such system for which good empirical evidence is available&#13;
     about successful operation. As part of a Bank financed wind farm project in the late&#13;
     1990s, a detailed study of system operation was prepared, which revealed few problems&#13;
     of integration where penetration levels are at the 14-35% level. However, it must be said&#13;
     that the wind regime in Cap Verde is very good, with high capacity factors and a&#13;
     relatively predictable wind regime that allows wind to be dispatched as â&#128;&#156;firmâ&#128;? on a day -&#13;
     ahead basis. Box T1.4 summarises the results of this study.&#13;

                         Box T1.1: Small diesel-wind hybrids in Cape Verde&#13;
The study examined the operating performance of the wind-diesel hybrids in 1995-1996, including&#13;
a detailed measurement and recording of total wind power, reactive power, voltage and&#13;
frequency.&#13;
&#13;
The operating strategy has evolved as experience has grown. In normal circumstances, two diesels&#13;
are operated to meet the net demand in the most economic way. Provided that the diesels operate&#13;
at 80-90% (close to peak efficiency), there is sufficient spinning reserve to provide for a sudden&#13;
drop in wind, a step change in load, or a wind turbine fault. The spinning reserve takes account&#13;
of the overload capacity of the diesels, which can operate at 110-120% load for short periods. In&#13;
other words, the wind turbines are treated as â&#128;&#156;firmâ&#128;? on a day -ahead basis (at least as firm as the&#13;
diesels): the loss of all wind generation in a short period is not considered credible.&#13;
&#13;
The main conclusions of this study included:&#13;
ï&#130;·   Even during periods of maximum wind penetration, maximum voltage and frequency&#13;
    variations were well within European limits. Even if the observed voltage and frequency&#13;
    fluctuations could be attributed entirely to wind turbine activity, it would be possible to add&#13;
    additional wind capacity without cause for concern about power quality.&#13;
ï&#130;·   Complex automated operating strategies in small networks are unlikely to be fully&#13;
    implemented, and simple dispatching rules will be the most effective.&#13;
ï&#130;·   Such simple operating rules have been able to avoid curtailment of wind turbine output even&#13;
    at periods of very low load and high wind â&#128;&#147; only one such instance in 1995.&#13;

131.    The wind integration costs in Figure T2.1 are those associated with increased&#13;
reserves in all three timeframesâ&#128;&#148;regulation, load following and unit commitment â&#128;&#148;that&#13;
are needed to balance the net variability of wind generation. Modern wind turbines&#13;
manage intermittency and uncertainty of wind resource with sophisticated plant-level&#13;
and turbine-level controls that enable stable and well-behaved performance of grids&#13;
with high levels of wind power penetration. 65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CAPACITY CREDIT&#13;
132.     The capacity credit assigned to a variable renewable energy project in a CBA is&#13;
subject to high uncertainty, and can range from zero (in which case the presence of a&#13;
renewable energy project would have no impact on the capacity expansion plan, and&#13;
only displaces some part of the energy output of the thermal projects in the system) to&#13;
some fraction that reflects its contribution to the load on peak system days. The&#13;
difficulty is often that in monsoonal climates, good production may be limited to a few&#13;
months of the year, so even with an apparently good annual load factor (say 30-40%),&#13;
and reliable delivery during the peak hours of the windy period, it may contribute little&#13;
or nothing during the week or month of the system peak load.&#13;
&#13;
133.     In the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s literature a few attempts to model the impact of wind and small&#13;
hydro on capacity expansion plans using capacity expansion optimisation models are&#13;
noted, but the problem is whether these models can credibly replicate the actual&#13;
variability of these variable sources. The results for China (Box T1.2) suggest that large&#13;
amounts of wind and small hydro do indeed have an impact in capacity expansion&#13;
plans, with apparent capacity credits of between 40-50% (i.e., 1,000 MW of wind&#13;
displaces 400-500 MW of conventional capacity) â&#128;&#147; but whether the performance of large&#13;
wind farms (often modelled as run-of-river hydro projects) is adequately represented in&#13;
conventional power systems planning models is often contested.&#13;
&#13;
134.     The general conclusion of the literature is that as a rule of thumb, the capacity&#13;
credit of a variable renewable energy project displacing gas in a fairly large system will&#13;
be roughly the same as its capacity factor. Table T1.5 shows the wind capacity credits&#13;
revealed in the NREL review of US integrated resource plans. But as we show in the&#13;
example of a wind project in Vietnam, below, such a rule of thumb is not applicable to&#13;
projects that are of much greater seasonal variation than wind projects in northern&#13;
Europe or parts of the USA.&#13;

Rules of thumb are all very well, but do they have any basis in reliable studies? One way capacity&#13;
impacts can be assessed is in a capacity expansion optimization model, in which the least-cost plan&#13;
is perturbed by forcing in renewable energy, and evaluating how much thermal capacity is&#13;
actually avoided (or deferred). There are few such studies; one was part of the economic analysis&#13;
conducted for the China Renewable Energy Scale-up Program (CRESP) project in China. In an&#13;
initial modeling study, the impacts of a wind development plan of 2,600 MW of additional wind&#13;
capacity over 10 years in the North China grid were assessed as shown in Figure A: this resulted in&#13;
a displacement of 836 MW of coal and 256 MW of oil-fired CCGTâ&#128;&#148;in effect a capacity credit of 43&#13;
percent.&#13;

135.     Such rules of thumb apply only to VRE. In contrast, the capacity credit of a&#13;
geothermal project, that does not have variable output, will be 100% (since these operate&#13;
at load factors of 90-92%, often greater than the coal plants they displace).&#13;
&#13;
The importance of tariff design&#13;
136.    Small hydro projects are sometimes dismissed as providing no firm energy, and&#13;
worthy of no capacity credit. But often this is the consequence of conventional&#13;
engineering design that could well be influenced by a better tariff structure. The most&#13;
important feature of a good renewable energy tariff is that it be related to benefits -&#13;
which, unfortunately, is not a commonly encountered feature of fixed feed-in tariffs,&#13;
most of which are based on estimated production costs.&#13;
&#13;
137.   In recent years, both Vietnam and Indonesia have given more careful thought to&#13;
renewable energy tariff design. In Vietnam, the most cost-effective renewable energy&#13;
&#13;
September 2015                                                                                                                 60&#13;
&amp;#12;                                 T1 VARIABLE RENEWABLE ENERGY&#13;
&#13;
technology is small hydro, and the avoided cost tariff design provided a high premium&#13;
for dry season energy produced during the peak hours of the day. The Indonesian&#13;
geothermal tariff ceiling issued in 2014 was also based on the benefits of geothermal â&#128;&#147;&#13;
whose purpose is to ensure that prices bid in competitive tenders do not exceed the&#13;
benefits (which includes a premium for avoided GHG emissions valued at $30/ton).&#13;
&#13;
138.     The Vietnam avoided cost tariff for small renewable energy projects provides a&#13;
strong incentive for small hydro projects designed for daily peaking, which in the case of&#13;
high head projects requires just relatively small volumes of storage. Figure T1.3 shows&#13;
the result of a dispatch simulation for the 12MW Nam Mu daily peaking small hydro&#13;
project, showing the average monthly dispatch during each of the three tariff blocks&#13;
(peak, normal and off-peak). This shows that even during the dry season, the average&#13;
monthly dispatch during the 4 peak hours is around 8 MW; during the system peak in&#13;
November it is 10 MW. During the wet months Julyï&#128;­August, the plant runs more or less&#13;
at its full capacity of 12 MW throughout the day. Of course, there is little or no&#13;
generation in the dry season during off-peak hoursâ&#128;&#148;but the economic motivation to&#13;
build daily peaking capacity rather than pure run-of-the-river is clear.&#13;
&#13;
139.    Such capacity benefits in a daily peaking hydro project are simple enough to&#13;
model in a CBA, particularly for high head projects where the head is relatively constant&#13;
and the operating rule is straightforward to simulate.66&#13;

140.    By contrast, this may be compared to the analogous evaluation of a wind project&#13;
proposed for Ly Son Island, (poorly) served by old diesel (Figure T1.4).67 The output is&#13;
strongly seasonal - just 2 MW on average for most of the year, 7 MW in the peak month&#13;

         part load if any further inflow, and empty the reservoir during the peak hours. Note that&#13;
         if the tariff is properly designed to reward peak hour generation, such projects do not&#13;
         need to be dispatched by a national or regional load dispatch centre â&#128;&#147; the developers will&#13;
         do that themselves in order to maximise their cash flow. Indeed, in Vietnam, one&#13;
         observes that even older projects, which do not have a PPA under the recently introduced&#13;
         avoided cost tariff, will operate in this manner to secure good relationships with the&#13;
         distribution companies and local dispatchers.&#13;
67       In 2008 the ADB proposed a wind-diesel hybrid for Ly Son Island. But the economic&#13;
         analysis showed that even with an off-peak tariff to encourage ice-making during the&#13;
         night (fishermen presently pick up ice from the mainland before heading out to sea), the&#13;
         effective load factor of wind power was just 14 percent. The level of subsidy required for&#13;
         the hybrid was little less than the current level of subsidy to maintain an old diesel, and&#13;
         the proposal was abandoned.&#13;

22 percent. In short, such a project has very little capacity value, especially when&#13;
compared to daily peaking hydro.&#13;

PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION&#13;
141.     It is often claimed that undispatchable renewable energy projects â&#128;&#147; notably run-&#13;
of-river hydro and wind - have no capacity value, as indeed illustrated by the Ly Son&#13;
Island example noted above. But that is not always or necessarily true. For example, in&#13;
Sri Lanka this was the view held by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) in 1998, at the&#13;
time the avoided cost tariff was under consideration, and so the avoided cost tariff&#13;
contained no capacity charge. However, from the perspective of the buyer, what really&#13;
matters is not the impact of a single small project, but the impact of the portfolio of&#13;
projects, whose inevitable diversity ensures that the variations in output are much&#13;
smaller in the aggregate portfolio than in the single plant (as illustrated in the case of Sri&#13;
Lanka in Box T1.3).&#13;

 The dry season output of the portfolio of small hydro projects shown is rarely zero, as shown&#13;

 This portfolio benefit can be given quantitative expression by calculation of the coefficient of&#13;
 variation (standard deviation divided by the mean) of monthly outputs. For the set of hydro&#13;
 projects illustrated above, the average of the coefficients for individual plants is 0.56; but the&#13;
 coefficient of variation for the aggregate output of the portfolio, as received by the buyer, is&#13;
 0.43.&#13;

142.    Figure T1.5 shows the energy production of a set of operating small hydro plants&#13;
in Vietnam, based on actual generation in 2003-2006. Even in the very dry year of 2005,&#13;
the aggregate output from the portfolio is clearly not zero: dry season output is roughly&#13;
20% of the wet season output (which implies that for 100MW of installed SHP capacity,&#13;
the capacity credit should be about 20MW).&#13;
&#13;

143.    It is this feature of the portfolio that provides the rationale for a capacity charge&#13;
in Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s avoided cost tariff, recovered over the peak hours of the dry season. In the&#13;
wet season, EVN is not capacity constrained, and therefore the rationale for a capacity&#13;
payment during this season is absent.&#13;
&#13;
144.    In some locations, while individual technologies cannot be diversified,&#13;
combinations of different renewable technologies may provide diversification. Just such&#13;
a combination may be possible in the Eastern China province of Zhejiang, where small&#13;
hydro peaks in summer, and wind peaks in winter. Figure T1.6 shows the relative&#13;
monthly output of five typical small-hydro projects in Zhejiang province compared to&#13;
the seasonal variation in demand for the Zhejiang grid as a whole. It is evident that the&#13;
seasonality of output and grid demand is poorly matched, even in the case of small&#13;
hydro projects with substantial storage.&#13;

146.     However, when the two are combined, one obtains the result of Figure T1.8,&#13;
now reasonably matched to the annual demand curve. Moreover, the result shown in&#13;
this Figure assumes no change in operating rule at those small hydro projects as have&#13;
some degree of seasonal storage. While changes in operating rule at multi-purpose&#13;
projects (25% of the total in Zhejiang) may be difficult, and at pure run-of-river projects&#13;
not possible, at least 35% of small hydro projects in Zhejiang have sufficient daily or&#13;
weekly storage capacity to permit optimization of the operating rule. Indeed, as shown&#13;
by the detailed case study, in order for this combination to provide real benefit, the small&#13;
hydro plants must have at least daily peaking capability, since wind farm output rarely&#13;
matches the daily load curve.&#13;

147.     This complementarity between wind and small hydro points to the even greater&#13;
complementarity between wind and large storage hydro, making wind power much&#13;
more attractive in systems with good flexibility to absorb the hourly and seasonal&#13;
variations in wind power output. When a portfolio of renewable resources can be&#13;
diversified (whether just small hydro alone, or the small-hydro wind combination), the&#13;
main benefit is that of an increased capacity credit, and the combination may become&#13;

economic as a result even though individual plants are not. Thus the capacity credit&#13;
increase of diversified renewables portfolio reduces overall portfolio costs as well as&#13;
providing a reduction of portfolio risk. The problem for CBA at appraisal is that the&#13;
portfolio benefits may become apparent to the utility only ex post (as was the case in the&#13;
ERAV evaluation of the avoided cost tariff for renewable energy in Vietnam). Ex Ante,&#13;
particularly at the outset of a renewable energy support program, utility planners will&#13;
be very doubtful about the contribution to firm capacity: but these examples may serve&#13;
as a rebuttal.&#13;

Best Practice recommendations 5: Variable renewable energy(VRE)&#13;
(1) Even when the proportion of variable renewables is small, and there is no technical&#13;
difficulty in absorbing the variable output, when combustion turbines or CCGTs are&#13;
used as load followers there will generally be some penalty associated with lower&#13;
average heat rates. This should be acknowledged. Only where pumped storage or large&#13;
storage hydro projects serve this purpose (and there are no environmental flow&#13;
constraints) can the integration costs be deemed negligible.&#13;
(2) In practice the options available to the economist charged with preparing the CBA for&#13;
a wind project are limited. If project preparation resources are available, there is no&#13;
substitute for a detailed systems study that can identify network stability problems with&#13;
detailed load flow and hourly dispatch simulations. In the absence of such a study,&#13;
utilities will frequently object that if only a year or two of detailed wind data is available,&#13;
even if the project did contribute to the system peak load in that particular year, there is&#13;
no guarantee that this would be the case every year.&#13;
(3) Given that the extent of capacity credit for variable renewables will always be&#13;
controversial, it is always best for the economic analysis to record capacity and energy&#13;
benefits separately, and that whatever assumption is made for the capacity credit be&#13;
included in the variables treated in the sensitivity analysis. LCOE calculations are&#13;
clearly not appropriate when evaluating variable renewables.&#13;

a corresponding line item in the table of economic flows.&#13;

T2      INCREMENTAL TRANSMISSION COSTS FOR RENEWABLES&#13;
&#13;
148.    Generalisations about incremental transmission costs are difficult, because much&#13;
depends on location, the type of renewable energy technology in question, the&#13;
configuration of the grid, and the extent to which local loads can absorb the incremental&#13;
generation (rather than dispatched to distant locations). Some RE technologies (such as&#13;
rooftop PV in urban centres) will avoid T&amp;D energy losses, but not avoid T&amp;D capacity&#13;
costs.&#13;
&#13;
149.     Generation of renewable energy resources is necessarily tied to the location at&#13;
which they occur. In many countries this entails very long transmission distances,&#13;
much longer than associated with the thermal equivalent (and sometimes even further&#13;
distant than large hydro projects). Moreover, thermal peaking projects are preferentially&#13;
located as near as possible to population centres. Consequently major investments in&#13;
transmission lines may be required to enable significant amounts of VRE. Indeed the&#13;
Bank is financing such a $345 million transmission infra-structure scheme in Egypt to&#13;
bring 3 GW of power from the rich wind resource region in the Gulf of Suez and Gabel&#13;
El-Zait to the Cairo area (280 km of double circuit 500kV, 50 km of 2 x 220kV and&#13;
associated substations) effectively costing $115/kW â&#128;&#147; a substantial incremental cost.68&#13;
Madrigal &amp; Stoft discuss transmission network planning for renewables scale-up. 69&#13;
&#13;
150.     The extent to which renewable energy projects incur incremental transmission&#13;
network investment costs will vary from country to country, and to the particular&#13;
applicable locational circumstances. A study for the Electricity Regulatory Agency of&#13;
Vietnam (ERAV) compared the transmission connection costs (mainly at 115 kV for&#13;
connections to the 500kV grid) of small hydro with those of thermal and large hydro&#13;
projects, and found average incremental network investment costs of $51/kW, compared&#13;
to 29 $/kW for large hydro and 4$/kW for thermal peaking and $12/kW for coal&#13;
projects (see Box T2.1 for details). On the other hand an ongoing system integration&#13;
study for Sulawesi (Indonesia) has determined that no additional transmission line&#13;
reinforcement is required to absorb the output from two proposed 50 MW wind farms&#13;
(Jeneponto 1 &amp; 2). 70&#13;

                   Box T2.1: Incremental transmission costs of small hydro in Vietnam&#13;
In 2009 Vietnam introduced an avoided cost-based tariff for qualified renewable energy (for&#13;
projects no greater than 30 MW). This has been very successful in enabling small hydro: in the&#13;
period 2012-2020, an additional 1,500 MW of such projects is at various stages of implementation.&#13;
The bulk of this capacity is in five provinces, whose transmission development plans have been&#13;
accordingly adjusted. These point to significant incremental network development costs,&#13;
primarily at 115kV, to evacuate this power to the 500kV grid: these are remote provinces whose&#13;
local demands are much smaller than the planned small hydro capacity. Table A shows the&#13;
results of a study of these network costs by the Vietnam Electricity Regulator ERAV: on average,&#13;
the incremental costs were estimated at around $51/kW.&#13;

These may be compared to the comparable transmission connection costs (mostly at 220kV) for&#13;
thermal and large hydro, shown in Table B. The highest average costs are for large hydro projects&#13;
(at $29/kW): costs for thermal projects (most of which in Vietnam are in the South, close to the Ho&#13;
Chi Minh City load centre and to the domestic gas fields), are in the range of $4-12/kW.&#13;

 Best Practice recommendations 6: Transmission connections for renewables&#13;
(1)     A major transmission line designed to evacuate large quantities of renewable&#13;
energy from proposed RE generating stations cannot have its own economic return,&#13;
independent of the generating projects in question (nor indeed can the generating&#13;
projects be assessed without taking into account the transmission evacuation cost). This&#13;
is true even if the transmission line is financed and built by completely different entities.&#13;
The renewable energy project (or projects) and transmission line should be justified&#13;
together. The Egypt wind power transmission project serves as a good example. Now it&#13;
may well be that not all wind farms presently expected would be built to the timetable&#13;
envisaged at the time the transmission line is built. But one deals with that problem by a&#13;
sensitivity analysis to show how the economic returns are sensitive to the realisation and&#13;
timing of such future generation project additions.&#13;
&#13;
(2)     However, the financial returns to the entity developing he transmission line will&#13;
of course depend on the transmission pricing regime and the regulatory arrangements&#13;
governing the transmission system operator (TSO). The details of transmission pricing&#13;
options will rarely affect the economic flows: the necessary transmission investments&#13;
(and related O&amp;M) should be separately recorded as lines in the table of economic flows.&#13;
&#13;
(3)    Given the wide range of incremental transmission costs in the literature, there is&#13;
no substitute for a reasoned project-specific examination â&#128;&#147; which for a program of small&#13;
hydro or wind development at the very least requires study of the relevant 115kv/220kv&#13;
transmission plan for the region in question. As shown in the Vietnam example, even if&#13;
the connection cost from generating project to the nearest substation is assumed by the&#13;
developer (as most PPAs require), the aggregate impact of many small hydro projects&#13;
may still impose significant additional network development costs at 115kV or 220kV on&#13;
the TSO.&#13;
&#13;
(4) When the incremental transmission costs for renewable energy are potentially&#13;
significant â&#128;&#147; which they often are when compared to gas CCGT near the load centres â&#128;&#147; it&#13;
is also worth taking a closer look at the gas price to such projects, and examine whether&#13;
the delivered price properly reflects import parity price (that should include the relevant&#13;
recovery costs for pipeline transportation from the gas field).&#13;

151.     The evidence of learning curve effects for new technologies is irrefutable, best&#13;
illustrated in the case of photvoltaics. That a similar effect will be observed for new&#13;
technologies such as CSP is similarly plausible, even if the cost reductions to date have&#13;
been somewhat lower than for PV modules.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
152.     CSP is considered to be a proven technology that is at the point of exiting the&#13;
early stage of its cost reduction curve. The learning curve of cost reduction as installed&#13;
capacity increases is linked to:&#13;
     ï&#130;· technical improvements, as lessons are learned from installed plants and parallel&#13;
         R&amp;D efforts identify performance improvements;&#13;
     ï&#130;· scaling to larger installed plant size, that allows for more efficient and more cost&#13;
         effective large components;&#13;
     ï&#130;· volume production that allows fixed costs of investments in production&#13;
         efficiency to be spread over larger production runs; and&#13;
     ï&#130;· Improved production process efficiency (e.g., reduced controllable costs,&#13;
         improved assembly lines, outsourcing, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
153.    Most assessments of the past learning curve for CSP suggest that thus far, the&#13;
CSP learning curve rate is no more than 10% - half the rate of 21% shown in Figure T3.1&#13;
for PV. However, many of the components and variants of this technology are not yet&#13;
fully commercial (such as molten salt, tower collectors and Fresnel collectors).&#13;
&#13;
154.     We know of two studies in the World Bank literature that have attempted a&#13;
quantification of learning curve benefits associated with specific bank-financed projects.&#13;
â&#128;&#147; for wind power as part of the project preparation for the China Renewable Energy&#13;
Scale-up Project (CRESP), and for the Morocco Noor II&amp;III CSP projects. In both cases&#13;
the benefit-cost analysis took the form of enumerating as costs the subsidies required to&#13;
build projects at (the high) present costs and in the near future, to be balanced against&#13;
the future benefits that are expressed as the difference between the lower (future) cost of&#13;
the technology against the fossil fuelled alternative. The Morocco report is still being&#13;
finalised (to respond to peer review comments on the draft), but even in its first version&#13;
it strengthened the case for World Bank financing of the Morocco CSP project.&#13;

The China CRESP wind power study71&#13;
155.      The question posed was whether subsidies for wind power in the short term,&#13;
defined as the incremental cost of a feed-in tariff, would be recouped in the future if the&#13;
capital cost of wind power declined as a result of large scale adoption to the point where&#13;
it fell below the average grid price, and as capacity factors improved over time, with&#13;
greater hub heights (increasing from 0.3 in 2004 to 0.36 by 2025).&#13;
&#13;
156.     In Table T3.1, the CRESP report hypothesised the wind additions starting in&#13;
2004, increasing to 43,000 MW by 2025, with an initial FIT of 0.55 Y/kWh (6.6 USc/kWh&#13;
at the then prevailing exchange rate), at a time when the average grid price was 0.31&#13;
Y/kWh (3.7 USc/kWh). The incremental costs were assumed eliminated by 2010 (i.e., in&#13;
that year, the FIT would be less than the average grid price), though because of the cost&#13;
of earlier year tariff support, the annual balance of the total wind portfolio turns positive&#13;
only in 2015 â&#128;&#147; it is these annual net balances (column 10) that constitute the basis for the&#13;
ERR and NPV calculations.&#13;

front FIT subsidy in years 2004-2009 earns an 18.6% return derived from future cost&#13;
reductions that follow from the learning curve. 72&#13;

72             The NPV calculations extend to 2050 (so the benefits of the projects built in 2025 extend&#13;

158.     However, there are many uncertainties in this illustrative calculation, and with&#13;
the benefits of hindsight (at the time of writing a decade later in 2015) we note the&#13;
following:&#13;
ï&#130;· FIT prices are now in the range of 0.51-0.61Y/kWh, (8.3-9.8 USc/kWh), still&#13;
     substantially above the general coal grid price of around 6USc/kWh, but below that&#13;
     of gas at around 11 USc/kWh.&#13;
ï&#130;·    The 25,000 MW assumed reached in the original calculation by 2020 was reached in&#13;
     2014: however, average capacity factors are significantly below those projected in&#13;
     2003, in large measure because of lack of transmission infrastructure. In 2014, the&#13;
     average national capacity factor was just 21% (though that of Fujian province was&#13;
     28.8%).&#13;
ï&#130;·    Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s National Energy Administration is now reported to be considering a first&#13;
     decrease in the current FIT rates (0.51-0.61 Y/kWh) to 0.47-0.51 Y/kWh (7.6 â&#128;&#147; 8.3&#13;
     USc/kWh).&#13;
ï&#130;·    These calculations did not consider either the avoided local or global externality&#13;
     damage costs, but also did not consider the capacity benefit of wind (see Box T1.3)&#13;
&#13;
The Morocco CSP study73&#13;
159.    Although the economic returns for the Noor II&amp;III CSP projects are negative (or&#13;
economic only under very high valuations of avoided carbon) the project specific&#13;
economic assessment does not recognize its contribution to the global public good. If&#13;
the global community makes a commitment to cover the subsidies necessary to build&#13;
CSP projects in the short run, the learning curve effects will lower the costs of CSP to the&#13;
point where it will provide lower cost electricity in the future (an experience clearly&#13;
documented by PV and wind, and generally expected for CSP as well).&#13;
&#13;
160.     The recent changes in the Spanish regulation have had a direct impact in the cost&#13;
learning curves for CSP. Before 2012, the old feed-in tariff structure in Spain dis-&#13;
incentivized cost reduction and held the cost of CSP plants at a very high level over&#13;
several years. However the currently prevailing tender process for CSP projects offers&#13;
more incentives for cost reductions and innovation. For this reason, a two-phase learning&#13;
curve approach for CSP was proposed: phase from 2006-2013 with PR = 81.4%; and&#13;
phase from 2014 on with PR = 80.5%. The progress ratio (PR) is a parameter that&#13;
expresses the rate at which costs decline for every doubling of cumulative installation.&#13;
For example, a progress ratio of 80% equals a learning rate (LR) of 20%: in other words, a&#13;
20% cost decrease for each doubling of the cumulative capacity. Both terms are used in&#13;
the literature.&#13;
&#13;
161.    The learning cost curve estimate above would indicate that the Noor Complex&#13;
can be expected to reduce the global cost curve for CSP by 3 percent, while the 2,000 MW&#13;
Morocco Solar Plan, if it relied solely on CSP, would be capable of reducing global CSP&#13;
costs by 13 percent.&#13;
&#13;
162.     Once the total installed global capacity of CSP reaches some 32,000MW, the&#13;
capital cost should decline from the present Euro 5,000/kW ($6,800/kW) to Euro&#13;
3,000/kW (4,110/kW) that is assumed to be reached by 2030. As shown in Figure T3.3,&#13;
while CSP today is more expensive than CCGT, requiring a levelised subsidy of 2.1&#13;
USc/kWh (when evaluated at the assumed 5% opportunity cost of capital) by 2030, the&#13;
cost of CSP will be 3.4 USc/kWh cheaper than gas. This is based on the trajectory of the&#13;
social cost of carbon as estimated by the US Interagency Working Group on the Social&#13;

      163.   These 2030 costs, and the benefits that go with them can only be achieved if the&#13;
      world builds 32 GW of CSP which would be necessary to bring down the costs as&#13;
      shown. Considering the ambitious CSP targets announced by some countries (e.g.,&#13;
      Saudi Arabiaâ&#128;&#153;s 25 GW CSP target by 2032, and the IEAâ&#128;&#153;s forecast of 70 GW of global CSP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      74            These estimates were prepared prior to the new Bank Guidelines on the valuation of&#13;
                    carbon (See Table M5.1). However, application of these new values ($30/ton CO2 in 2015,&#13;
                    increasing to $50/ton CO2) would not significantly change the findings of Figure T3.3&#13;

capacity by 2035), this estimate of global capacity additions is not unreasonable. Indeed,&#13;
by 2030, the IEA 450ppm scenario anticipates 15 GW of CSP just in Europe.&#13;
&#13;
164.     Detailed calculations show that the global investment into CSP in the short term&#13;
â&#128;&#147; to cover the incremental costs and subsidies required for the projects built today, such&#13;
as Noor II&amp;III â&#128;&#147; bring a long run (real) rate of economic return of around 7%. This is just&#13;
like a standard economic analysis, in which the costs are the subsidy requirements in the&#13;
early years, and the benefit stream is the cost advantage in future years (as shown in&#13;
Figure T3.3). Table T3.2 summarises the calculations for three scenarios based on the&#13;
assumption that by 2030, 32 GW of CSP would supply either the European market (and&#13;
therefore includes the cost of HVDC transmission â&#128;&#147; for example, from Libya to Milan,&#13;
and Jordan to Ankara). European gas prices are taken from the 2013 IEA World Energy&#13;
Outlook. For example in the pessimistic scenario, CSP capital costs only reach 3,800&#13;
$/kW by 2030, and carbon prices decline rather than increase.&#13;

165.     The Noor CSP project reaps only a very small share of these benefits for itself, for&#13;
Noor pushes us only a very small distance toward the global learning curve target of 32&#13;
GW: none of these benefits were applied to the Noor economic flows. This analysis&#13;
simply illustrates what may be the benefits of the global learning curve, and what are the&#13;
likely returns if the global international community should invest in CSP. There is also the&#13;
additional question of whether the World Bank should be leading the effort for CSP,&#13;
given the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s own opportunity cost of capital (EOCK). While the 6.9% baseline&#13;
return is arguably above the (real) OECD opportunity cost of capital, the 10% rate&#13;
reflects better the real rates of economic return obtainable in other developing country&#13;
projects and other sectors supported by the World Bank. The analysis suggests that only&#13;
under very optimistic assumptions would the economic return of a global investment in&#13;
CSP meet normal EOCK expectations.&#13;
&#13;
Best practice recommendation 7: Learning curve benefits for renewables&#13;
(1)      As noted in the main text, rigorous quantification of learning curve benefits&#13;
requires further research, and the only recommendation we can make for this first&#13;
edition of the guidance document is to avoid generalised textual assertions that a specific&#13;
renewable energy project has â&#128;&#156;learning curve benefitsâ&#128;?. By definit ion such global&#13;
benefits accrue to other projects in the future, and therefore serve only to justify support&#13;
from the global community (and the IFIs) in the short term. No matter how great the&#13;
learning curve benefit to future CSP projects, the incremental costs of the Morocco CSP&#13;
projects still have to be recovered today, either by Morocco or through grants and&#13;
concessional finance from the global community.&#13;
&#13;
(2)     That said, even if learning curve benefits do not change the project ERR, such&#13;
studies of learning curve benefits inform the second &amp; third of the three main questions&#13;
demanded by OPSPQ of a project economic analysis, namely to justify World Bank&#13;
financing and support in project design.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
    166.     The gold standard of counter-factuals is one prepared with detailed power&#13;
    system planning models. Among the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s recent renewable energy projects, such&#13;
    models were available for the Morocco CSP, Indonesian geothermal, and Vietnam hydro&#13;
    projects. In each case the models were maintained by the power system planning&#13;
    departments of national utilities, and were run with and without the proposed&#13;
    renewable energy project. Where the Bank has good established relationships with the&#13;
    utility planning departments, obtaining their cooperation in making sure that the data&#13;
    inputs were appropriate for economic analysis (i.e. using border prices rather than the&#13;
    financial prices) is often straightforward (provided the caveats noted in Technical Note&#13;
    T1 concerning the use of economic prices and capacity credit are observed).&#13;
&#13;
    Simple counter-factuals&#13;
    167.     The difficulties arise where such models are not available, in which case the&#13;
    counter-factual (or â&#128;&#156;baselineâ&#128;? as it is termed in the carbon accounting guidelines) must&#13;
    be constructed by the project economist. The problem is not so much choosing the type&#13;
    of thermal generation that would be displaced by the RE project (which in some cases is&#13;
    also straightforward), but how the avoided costs are booked in the table of economic&#13;
    flows. Above all this is problematic in the case of variable renewables.&#13;
&#13;
    168.     What one often sees in such â&#128;&#156;simpleâ&#128;? counterfactuals is that the benefits are&#13;
    simply booked as the levelised cost of thermal energy. Even when this is correctly&#13;
    calculated using the border price or import parity price for the energy, the benefits will&#13;
    be overstated. The correct approach is to separate energy and capacity benefits.&#13;
&#13;
    169.    Table T4.1 shows such a calculation (using the same basic cost assumptions as in&#13;
    Table C1.13). Row [9] shows that if a 100% capacity credit is taken (i.e. the cost of CCGT&#13;
    capacity necessary to produce the same output as the wind project), then the ERR is&#13;
    11.2%, or 12.8% when the benefits of avoided GHG emissions are also included.&#13;

        credit in the sensitivity analysis: using backsolve, 75 it is easy to show that (in this&#13;

        greater than the capacity credits shown in Table T1.5, so in this instance one would&#13;
        conclude that the wind project is not economic from the perspective of the client country.&#13;

        Box T4.1: Counter-factual for Indonesian wind energy using the ProSym Model&#13;
A recent study to develop a tariff ceiling based on the benefits of wind energy (rather&#13;
than on production costs) for Indonesia benefitted from the ability to run detailed&#13;
dispatch simulations using the ProSym model used by PLN, the Indonesian utility. This&#13;
was done both for the large Java-Bali and Sulawesi grids, for which capacity expansion&#13;
plans had recently been established. Under the assumption that the wind projects&#13;
would provide no capacity benefit, the optimal hourly dispatch in the absence of wind&#13;
was perturbed by the hourly output of a wind project (i.e. wind treated as a negative&#13;
load). These simulations took into account the different ramp rates of thermal projects.&#13;

With these results in hand, the mix of thermal generation displaced in each year was&#13;
readily established, and could then be valued at import parity price to derive the&#13;
average avoided energy benefit. In 2016, shown above, wind displaces auto diesel&#13;
(HSD) and marine fuel oil (MFO); by 2020 these will have been retired and replaced by&#13;

THE COUNTERFACTUAL AND DISCOUNT RATES&#13;
172.    The discount rate is a critical assumption in any comparison of a renewable&#13;
energy option against its counterfactual. As an illustration, consider the problem now&#13;
faced by Afghanistan: should the country continue to rely mainly on imported electricity&#13;
from its CAR neighbours,76 or should it build its own generation project based on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

domestic (Sheberghan) gas, or develop its own smaller scale renewable energy projects. 77&#13;
The comparison is made on the basis of a 300 MW of additional load imported at an&#13;
annual load factor of 0.7. Comparing like with like means that to produce the same&#13;
amount of energy as the gas and import options, at a 35% annual capacity factor one&#13;
must build 600 MW of wind.78&#13;
&#13;
173.    The NPV calculations at the traditional 10% discount rate are shown in Table&#13;
T4.4: the results show that the NPV of the cost of imports is $998 million, as against&#13;
$1,013 million for gas and $1,235 million for renewable energy. Imports are least cost&#13;
(though not by much).&#13;

Note: Calculations assume a 20-year life: for sake of legibility the snapshot shown here is just for the first few&#13;
years. The calculations are based on costs corresponding to 50 MW-scale increments using gas engines&#13;
(projects larger than this size will be very difficult to finance for the time being). Gas engines are also easier to&#13;
operate than CCGT, and are seen as the most appropriate gas generation technology for Afghanistan in the&#13;
current security environment.&#13;

174.     But change the discount rate and the conclusions also change. Figure T4.1&#13;
shows the NPV for each option as a function of the discount rate. Imports are only the&#13;
least cost option for discount rates above 9%; from 4 to 9% the indicated choice is gas,&#13;
and below 4% the indicated choice is renewable energy. In short, lower the discount&#13;
rate, the more attractive is the renewable energy option.&#13;

175.     However, these comparisons do not take into account the negative externalities&#13;
of fossil based generation. Imports are based on gas generation in the Central Asian&#13;
Republics (Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan), and therefore also generate GHG emissions.&#13;
How do the results change if these externalities are taken into account?&#13;
&#13;
176.     In Table T4.5 we include a calculation of the GHG emission damage costs using&#13;
the values in the World Bank guidance document for the social value of carbon (see table&#13;
M5.1).79    Now at the 10% discount rate, the cost of the renewable energy option&#13;
(NPV=$1,235 million) is only marginally above the import option ($1,126 million), and&#13;
below the gas option ($1,246 million). Indeed, at all discount rates below 10% renewable&#13;
energy is least cost when the GHG emission damage costs are taken into account (Figure&#13;
T4.2).&#13;

T5      MACROECONOMIC IMPACTS&#13;
&#13;
178.     The general presumption of CBA is that the scale of a single energy sector&#13;
project is too small to affect important macroeconomic characteristics â&#128;&#147; labour inputs do&#13;
not significantly distort national labour markets, no crowding out of investment in other&#13;
sectors, and the additional power does not significantly change GDP composition. Of&#13;
course there are some significant exceptions â&#128;&#147; the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Ganga project&#13;
(power and irrigation) being one example - a project so large as to have consumed over&#13;
almost a decade a major share of all national public sector capital expenditure and labor&#13;
inputs (crowding out investment in other sectors), and changed to such large extent&#13;
agricultural productivity that significant changes in the structure of the economy were&#13;
anticipated as a result.80&#13;
&#13;
179.      Few power sector projects need to run CGE and input/output models to&#13;
evaluate macro-economic consequences as part of project appraisals. However, as noted&#13;
earlier, recently CGE modelling has been used in the PSIA of a large power sector reform&#13;
DPC project (Pakistan) where significant price changes are anticipated as a result of&#13;
subsidy and efficiency reforms, with potentially significant impacts on poorer&#13;
households.81&#13;
&#13;
180.    Potential macroeconomic spillovers have become a major issue in project&#13;
appraisal of high cost VRE, for which it is has been argued that macroeconomic benefits&#13;
not captured in a conventional CBA provide additional benefits that offset the&#13;
incremental costs. Employment creation (â&#128;&#156;green jobsâ&#128;?)82 and the establishment of new&#13;
industries related to domestic component manufacture are the most commonly&#13;
encountered such benefits in this category. A single 50-100 MW wind project will&#13;
admittedly have negligible macro-economic impact, but a large scale commitment to&#13;
green energy â&#128;&#147; in the 1000s of MW (it is argued) would have significant (and&#13;
presumably) beneficial impact. But at such scale, the incremental capital requirements&#13;
(even if to some extent covered by concessional green financing) may well crowd out&#13;
other investments and other job-creating expenditures.83&#13;
&#13;
181.     Our review of Bank renewable energy projects shows that there is only one such&#13;
project (the Morocco CSP project) for which macroeconomic impacts have been&#13;
satisfactorily studied. All of the various studies conducted to date (MENA CSP, various&#13;
wind programmes) show that the realisation of these macroeconomic benefits are&#13;
dependent upon the outlook for a significant domestic market - for which government&#13;
assurances to commitments to further renewable energy projects are critical. Few&#13;
industrialists will be persuaded on the basis of aspirational renewable energy targets (so&#13;
many % by RE by 2020 etc) in the absence of sustainable institutional and pricing&#13;
reforms. In Morocco the Government has backed up its targets with the establishment of&#13;
a strong agency (MASEN) to implement solar projects, and has assembled a credible&#13;

83      Again the South Africa Medupi coal project illustrates the problem. The economic&#13;
        analysis showed that even leaving aside any additional capacity costs to offset the lack of&#13;
        firm capacity of wind projects, to produce by wind power the same energy as at the&#13;
        Medupi coal project would require an additional $20 billion of finance, far in excess of the&#13;
        carbon finance (of around $1 billion) actually available to South Africa. See World Bank,&#13;

question for the project economist would be whether project preparation funds are&#13;
sufficient to include a high quality study of potential macroeconomic benefits for the&#13;
country in question.&#13;
&#13;
182.     In competitively awarded tenders for large projects (as are the Morocco CSP&#13;
projects), there may well be requirements for specific local sourcing requirements, or&#13;
bidders may make such commitments for additional consideration. But in a situation&#13;
where such contracts are also subject to penalty clauses for failure to meet promised&#13;
commercial operation dates, it remains to be seen whether these targets can in practice&#13;
be achieved or enforced.&#13;
&#13;
183.    All such studies of macroeconomic spill-over effects (including estimates of job&#13;
creation) suffer from the incremental cost problem â&#128;&#147; there may well be net job creation&#13;
from high cost renewable energy, but if the incremental costs are carried by consumers,&#13;
consumer demand for other goods and services will reduce employment in other sectors&#13;
(and similarly if Government covers the incremental costs, that crowds out other&#13;
government investment and its associated job creation potential). Only the application&#13;
of sophisticated CGE models and properly updated input-output tables will allow&#13;
credible assessments of these macro-economic effects.&#13;
&#13;
Best Practice recommendations 8: Macroeconomic spillovers&#13;
(1) In the absence of a detailed country-specific study of the prospects for domestic&#13;
manufacture of RE equipment, one should avoid speculative textual claims about&#13;
macroeconomic spillover effects.&#13;
&#13;
(2) Even where a country-specific study is available, with a finding that a general target&#13;
of, say, 5,000 MW by 2025 would enable cumulative net macroeconomic benefits of $500&#13;
million by 2025, the presumption that a 500 MW project today would capture a&#13;
proportional share of the total would need careful justification. The main difficulty is&#13;
that todayâ&#128;&#153;s investment cost may be relatively certain, while the future macroeconomic&#13;
benefit will be highly uncertain.85 In any event, the benefits would not be linearly&#13;
scalable, because the first project today would unlikely benefit significantly from the&#13;
gradual introduction of domestic manufacturing capability.&#13;
&#13;
(3) A good country specific study of the macro-economic impacts of a major shift to&#13;
renewable energy, including employment impacts, will require significant resources,&#13;
and the application of appropriate input-output and macroeconomic models. Such a&#13;
study was prepared for the Noor I&amp;II CSP projects in Morocco, which is recommended&#13;
reading before embarking on any similar effort to support the justification of high-cost&#13;
renewables in other countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
EMPLOYMENT IMPACTS&#13;
184.    Many renewable energy projects make somewhat misleading claims about job&#13;
creation. In the case of World Bank project appraisal reports, these are often found in the&#13;
&#13;
84      Given the currently difficult economic conditions of the many countries in the MENA&#13;
        region that might otherwise be candidates for additional CSP projects (such as Egypt,&#13;
        Libya, Jordan) an export market for a Moroccan manufacturer of mirrors or parabolic&#13;
        collectors seems doubtful (at least in the short to medium terms). The near-collapse of the&#13;
        solar market in Spain adds further uncertainty (and erodes the hope that CSP energy can&#13;
        be exported to the EU at high prices, at least until such time as carbon prices in the EU&#13;
        ETS have recovered to previous levels).&#13;
85      In the PAD economic analysis for Noor II&amp;III, the estimated macroeconomic benefit of&#13;
        6,000MW of CSP by 2025 was estimated at $900 million.&#13;

     The analysis indicates that a ramp-up of renewable energy to 15% of the grid&#13;
     connected MW capacity would create new jobs in the region of 35,000-51,000. For the&#13;
     upper limit, 20,000 would be skilled, 22,000 semi-skilled, and 9,000 unskilled.&#13;
quoting the South Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (SARI) as the source.&#13;
&#13;
Issues&#13;
185.     While it is true these figures are taken from a study prepared by a reputable&#13;
source, such claims need careful scrutiny by the economic analysis:&#13;
         ï&#130;· Estimates of gross direct employment creation convey little useful information.&#13;
           Particularly where RE displaces a thermal fuel produced domestically, more&#13;
           renewable energy means less coal/oil/gas â&#128;&#147; so in the case of South Africa,&#13;
           where coal projects use local domestic coal, less coal means loss of coal mining&#13;
           jobs and in related coal transportation. 87 Only net employment creation&#13;
           estimates are meaningful, so it is necessary to also state any relevant job losses&#13;
           in the displaced fossil fuel.&#13;
         ï&#130;· The large employment benefits noted in many studies of European countries&#13;
           are really a consequence of renewable energy technology manufacture&#13;
           (particularly where much equipment is exported, such as in Spain and&#13;
           Denmark in the case of wind), so the question is the extent to which these job&#13;
           gains apply to countries which do not have domestic manufacturing capacity&#13;
           for renewable energy generating equipment or reasonable prospects for doing&#13;
           so (a question to be tested in most small World Bank country clients). The job&#13;
           creation benefit of manufacturing turbines (about 70% of the total cost of a&#13;
           wind farm) generally accrues to turbine producing and exporting countries&#13;
           (China and Europe): local employment during operation of wind farms and&#13;
           small hydro projects is small.&#13;
         ï&#130;· But even if there were a net employment gain in the energy sector, that does&#13;
           not necessarily mean there is an economy-wide gain in employment.             For&#13;
           example, where it is electricity consumers who carry the burden of the&#13;
           incremental costs of RE (e.g. in Malaysia, where the incremental costs of the&#13;
           feed-in tariff are passed to consumers by a 1% surcharge on electricity bills of&#13;
           all but the smallest consumers), all other things equal they will accommodate a&#13;
           higher electricity price (at least in part) by spending less of their disposable&#13;
           income on other goods, and therefore employment in those sectors that&#13;
           produce such goods, and in the economy as a whole (when the relevant&#13;
           multiplier effects are included), could potentially fall.&#13;
         ï&#130;· In project economic analysis, economics treats labour as an input, not an&#13;
           output: the substitution of labour by capital and other factors of production to&#13;
           increase productivity is considered to be one of the driving forces of economic&#13;
           growth.&#13;
         ï&#130;· If a project has significant domestic labour inputs, consideration should be&#13;
           given to shadow pricing, particularly for unskilled and semi-skilled labour. 88&#13;

87       Some would argue that given often poor working conditions of many coal mining&#13;
         operations in developing countries, reduction of mining jobs is a benefit per se, but that is&#13;
         not necessarily how the affected miners, or their Governments, would evaluate such job&#13;
         losses in the mining sector.&#13;
88       This is routinely done for ADB energy sector projects, but is relatively rare in recent&#13;
         World Bank renewable energy projects.&#13;

Best Practice recommendations 9: Employment impacts of renewable energy projects&#13;
(1) If job creation figures are presented, any direct gross employment estimates&#13;
associated with the proposed project should be accompanied by employment loss figures&#13;
for the thermal energy that is displaced, and data presented in net form. Where such&#13;
shifts have a regional dimension (for example, most wind and solar projects in Vietnam&#13;
are in the south, whereas most coal mining is in the north), that should be expressly&#13;
noted in the distributional analysis.&#13;
&#13;
(2) Even where there is a net employment increase, one should be careful about&#13;
extrapolating this to the macroeconomic level, particularly for renewable energy projects&#13;
with high incremental costs.&#13;
&#13;
(3) Where significant labour inputs arise, consideration should be given to shadow&#13;
pricing labour costs. However, there needs to be some credible source for such&#13;
adjustments: we recommend against arbitrary values (such as the 0.9 adjustment&#13;
encountered widely in ADB reports). In any event, there are few renewable energy&#13;
projects that have large local labour inputs, so the (beneficial) impact of shadow pricing&#13;
on the economic flows will be small.&#13;

188.     While the average energy output of the renewable energy project is easily&#13;
calculated (row[5]), a first question is whether there are any differential transmission&#13;
losses. In the case of the geothermal project it is assumed (in this illustrative calculation)&#13;
that the geothermal project is in a remote location relative to its thermal alternative, so&#13;
the amount of thermal energy replaced is less than the geothermal project output. On the&#13;
other hand, in the case of an urban rooftop PV program, which is in the load centre itself,&#13;
one avoids the T&amp;D losses associated with supplying the urban load from a thermal&#13;
project located some distance from the load centre. In this case, the amount of energy&#13;

&#13;
displaced is therefore 10% greater than the nominal output of the rooftop PV project&#13;
(row[6]).&#13;
&#13;
189.    In row [18] is entered the gross efficiency on an LHV basis. 89 If FGD or dry&#13;
cooling is fitted (in the case of the coal project), own use increases. The net efficiency&#13;
and heat rate â&#128;&#147; (rows [32]-[34]) are higher than the gross rates (because the net heat rate&#13;
includes the energy required to cover own-use consumption).&#13;
&#13;
190.    In rows [20]-[30] one calculates the fuel quantities displaced and the&#13;
corresponding avoided cost (benefit) of the displaced thermal energy. Coal is generally&#13;
priced in international markets as $/ton, and LNG and natural gas as $/mmBTU (also&#13;
the units used in the IEA energy price forecasts and the World Bank commodity price&#13;
forecasts)&#13;
&#13;
191.    Note that these calculations capture only what is replaced by the renewable&#13;
energy. They do not include the additional penalties imposed on the balance of the&#13;
thermal generation system. As discussed in Technical Note T1, if a 500 MW CCGT is&#13;
ramped up and down several times a day to absorb the output of a wind project, then&#13;
the average heat rate of the remaining output is subject to a ramping penalty â&#128;&#147; which&#13;
should be calculated and itemised separately under the rubric of integration costs.&#13;
&#13;
192.     These calculations should all be built into the table of economic flows, because&#13;
both the output of the renewable energy project, and the output of the thermal&#13;
alternative will decline over time (as part of the normal degradation of equipment over&#13;
time). Moreover, since the Guidance Document for GHG emission valuation now&#13;
stipulates a value of the social cost of carbon that increases over time, the calculations&#13;
must in any event be done for each year in the project life.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THE NUMERAIRE AND ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY COST OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE&#13;
193.    Different projects adjust for the opportunity cost of foreign exchange in different&#13;
ways. If the numeraire is in foreign exchange, domestic costs and benefits are adjusted&#13;
by the standard correction factor (SCF); if the numeraire is in domestic currency, foreign&#13;
exchange costs are adjusted by the shadow exchange rate (SER). Without proper&#13;
adjustment, the economic returns may be over-estimated.&#13;
&#13;
194.     In the past, some Country Offices provided an annual guidance document on&#13;
the SCF (e.g., India in the 1990s). However, this does not appear to be the case today, so&#13;
if an adjustment is warranted, the calculation has to be done by the project economist on&#13;
a project by project basis. The data to do this may require some effort (and therefore&#13;
resources) to collect. Very few RE projects have gone to the trouble of doing this: among&#13;
the projects reviewed, just two examples were found (the Tarbela T4 Extension, and the&#13;
Indonesia Geothermal Project).&#13;
&#13;
Issues&#13;
195.     Many issues arise for energy projects. The avoided health damages of fossil fuel&#13;
combustion â&#128;&#147; a benefit of RE projects â&#128;&#147; is most often calculated in US$ terms through the&#13;
benefit-transfer method (see Technical Note M4). However, because health care costs are&#13;
non-tradable, they properly require SCF adjustment if the numeraire is in $US (which&#13;
will lower the calculated value of the benefit stream).&#13;
&#13;
196.   To illustrate the importance of proper adjustment, consider the calculation of&#13;
ERR in Table M1.2 (from the Indonesian Geothermal Project), where the numeraire is&#13;
&#13;

Best Practice recommendations 10: Numeraire &amp; standard correction factors&#13;
(1) Because of the growing importance of GHG accounting and valuation of emissions in&#13;
$US terms, and the need to include avoided GHG emission benefits in the economic&#13;
analysis (generally denominated in $US/ton), in most cases the numeraire for the&#13;
economic analysis should be in $US.&#13;
&#13;
(2) Where the bulk of the investment costs are domestic â&#128;&#147; generally the case for large&#13;
countries (and certainly true of most projects in India and China), the numeraire should&#13;
be in the local currency.&#13;
&#13;
(3 With a $US numeraire, in the tabulation of economic flows of non-traded domestic&#13;
transactions (such as the domestic component of construction cost, or the electricity&#13;
output) should be adjusted by the SCF, provided a reliable calculation of SCF is&#13;
available.&#13;

&#13;
CALCULATION FORMAT&#13;
199.     The universal tabular format for financial analysis is that columns represent&#13;
years, rows represent transactions. Every World Bank PAD financial analysis, and all&#13;
the IFC and ADB projects, adopt this convention.&#13;
&#13;
200.    Yet for economic analyses a variety of different conventions are in evidence.&#13;
Many use a format where columns represent transactions, and rows represent years.&#13;
However, there are several reasons why the analysis and presentation of economic&#13;
analysis should follow the same convention as the financial analysis in which columns&#13;
represent years, and rows represent transactions&#13;
        ï&#130;· Economic and financial analyses share many assumptions, and economic and&#13;
          financial flows are linked. Spreadsheets that have links between some tables in&#13;
          column format and some tables in row format are much more likely to have&#13;
          errors than if all tables follow the same convention.&#13;
        ï&#130;· Once a time-in-rows format is adopted, there is a tendency to limit the number&#13;
          of columns that can be presented in a single portrait format page, making the&#13;
          calculations less transparent, and even driving a simplification of the analysis&#13;
          itself.&#13;
201.    Annex A4 (Sample Economic Analysis), and the various examples in other&#13;
Technical Notes, illustrate how the economic flows should be presented in the&#13;
recommended format.&#13;

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
202.    There are wide variations in the quality and scope of sensitivity analysis&#13;
presented in economic analyses of renewable energy projects:&#13;
        ï&#130;· No sensitivity analysis at all90&#13;
        ï&#130;· Sensitivity analysis limited to recalculation of ERR by variation of input&#13;
          variables by fixed percentages&#13;
        ï&#130;· Switching values&#13;
        ï&#130;· Scenario analysis&#13;
&#13;
203.    Sensitivity analysis that is limited to recalculation of ERR by variation of a few&#13;
input variables by fixed percentages is widespread, but again reflects practice. Table&#13;
M1.5 illustrates a typical (and unsatisfactory) example.&#13;
&#13;

                 Capacity factor increases to 40% from 35%            7%&#13;
                 Economic tariff increases from 7 cents to 9 cents    9%&#13;
&#13;
204.     The shortcomings of such an approach to sensitivity analysis were already noted&#13;
in the 1998 Guidelines: 91&#13;
     Sensitivity analysis has three major limitations: it does not take into account the&#13;
     probabilities of occurrence of the events; it does not take into account the correlations&#13;
     among the variables; and finally, the practice of varying the values of sensitive&#13;
     variables by standard percentages does not necessarily bear any relation to the observed&#13;
     (or likely) variability of the underlying variables. The switching value presentation is&#13;
     a much better way to give information about sensitivity.&#13;
&#13;
205.     The minimum requirement for an acceptable sensitivity analysis is the&#13;
calculation of switching values for the main assumptions: this is the value of the&#13;
assumption that brings the ERR to the hurdle rate (NPV to zero), together with a&#13;
commentary of the circumstances under which this might occur. The Best Practice&#13;
recommendations below enumerate the variables that should be considered for inclusion&#13;
in such an analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

        project CBAs present no sensitivity analysis.&#13;

&#13;
Variables that should always appear in a sensitivity analysis (many of which may be also&#13;
identified in the project risk matrix) include&#13;
&#13;
All projects&#13;
         ï&#130;· Construction costs&#13;
         ï&#130;· Construction cost delay&#13;
         ï&#130;· The timing and cost of major maintenance events (e.g., runner blade replacement in&#13;
           hydro projects, major refurbishments of CSP equipment, make-up wells in geothermal&#13;
           projects, etc)&#13;
         ï&#130;· Where benefits are based on WTP and estimates of the demand curve, on the shape of&#13;
           the demand curve (price elasticity)&#13;
         ï&#130;· For the calculation of returns including avoided externalities, uncertainty in damage&#13;
           costs (which vary by orders of magnitude)&#13;
         ï&#130;· International fuel prices&#13;
         ï&#130;· Discount rate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Hydro projects&#13;
       ï&#130;· sedimentation risk (often higher than expected) â&#128;&#147; for example modelled by the number&#13;
         of days a plant must be shut down for sediment flushing operations (see Rampur&#13;
         project)&#13;
       ï&#130;· hydrology risk&#13;
       ï&#130;· In rehabilitation projects, the achievable efficiency improvements (e.g. changes in&#13;
         operating rules at hydro projects to achieve operation at best efficiency point may be&#13;
         difficult to predict)&#13;
       ï&#130;· uncertainty associated with environmental flow regimes (sometimes unknown at the&#13;
         time of appraisal)&#13;

207.    Box M1.2 provides other examples of how the results of a good sensitivity&#13;
analysis can be displayed. An illustration of a sensitivity analysis for the discount rate is&#13;
shown in Figures T4.1 and T4.2.&#13;
&#13;
208.     The main shortcoming of such analysis is that the focus is on one variable at a&#13;
time: in the real world, it would be very unusual for just a single assumption to be&#13;
subject to uncertainty and in the future found to have been proven incorrect, while all&#13;
other values remain unchanged. Two methods to get around this problem can be&#13;
recommended:&#13;
     ï&#130;· Monte Carlo simulation for risk assessment, in which all major input&#13;
         assumptions are treated as random variables, with deviations from the expected&#13;
         values for all variables simultaneously examined (see Technical Note M7).&#13;
     ï&#130;· Scenario analysis, in which plausible best and worst cases are constructed, and&#13;
         for which the consequences of making an incorrect assumption are explicitly&#13;
         considered (see Technical Note C5)&#13;
&#13;
209.    Whether either or both of these techniques should be used to complement the&#13;
switching values analysis is a matter of judgement: certainly for any major project a&#13;
Monte Carlo simulation (or an RDM assessment) is now considered to be best practice,&#13;
and the value of scenario analysis is illustrated by the examples in Technical Note C4.&#13;

M2      ESTIMATING DEMAND CURVES&#13;
&#13;
DEMAND CURVES AND CONSUMER SURPLUS&#13;
210.    Estimating the demand curve for household electricity services (lighting, TV&#13;
viewing) is widely used as the basis for estimating the benefits of rural electrification&#13;
and off-grid renewable energy projects.&#13;
&#13;
211.     Figure M2.1 shows the demand for lighting, in kiloLumenHours/month, as a&#13;
function of price. Before electrification, a household obtains little light ( QKERO) from&#13;
expensive kerosene (PKERO) (point x). Electrification dramatically reduces the price of&#13;
lighting, resulting in the consumption of greater quantity of light (QE) now supplied by&#13;
cheap electricity (PE).&#13;
&#13;
                          Figure M2.1: Demand curve for lighting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
212.    The so-called willingness to pay (WTP) is the area under the demand curve.&#13;
Before electrification the household uses kerosene (at the point x in the figure), so the&#13;
total WTP = A + B + D. But it pays QKERO x PKERO = B + D. Therefore the net benefit of&#13;
consuming QKERO units of lighting is the difference between WTP and cost, namely the&#13;
area A, a quantity termed the consumer surplus.&#13;
&#13;
213.     After electrification, WTP is the area under the curve A + B + C + D + E, and the&#13;
cost D + E= QE x PE , so now the net benefit is the consumer surplus =A + B + C. It&#13;
follows that the benefit of electrification is the increase in consumer surplus, namely (A +&#13;
B + C) - (A) = B + C.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                          M2 DEMAND CURVES&#13;
&#13;
214.    Demand curves for services (such as for lighting in Figure M2.1) are easily&#13;
converted into demand curves for electricity (Figure M2.2). One sometimes uses the&#13;
terminology of non-incremental and incremental demand. Thus, in Figure M2.2,&#13;
     ï&#130;· substituted demand (non-incremental) =QKERO&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Induced (incremental) demand             =QELEC-QKERO&#13;

215.      Different devices convert electricity into lumens at different efficiencies. The&#13;
equivalent cost of kerosene wick lamps may be $1/kWh, that for grid-supplied&#13;
electricity $0.12/kWh. However, the highest equivalent per kWh cost for households is&#13;
for dry cells, which have costs of as much as $890/kWh (Table M2.1).&#13;

EXAMPLES OF EMPIRICALLY ESTIMATED DEMAND CURVES&#13;
216.     Demand curves for household electricity prove to be highly concave. Figure&#13;
M2.3 shows the estimated demand curves for lighting in rural households in Peru. These&#13;
were estimated for each of the five household income quintiles: the points shown&#13;
represent the five main ways in which lighting demand is served â&#128;&#147; from simple wick&#13;
lamps, to hurricane lamps, car battery, Petromax (a high efficiency and more costly&#13;
hurricane lamp-type device), and for grid-supplied electricity. The largest differences in&#13;
use across income groups is for grid electricity ranging from 100 kLmh/month in the&#13;
poorest quintile to 330 kLmh/month in the highest income quintile. Yet even in the&#13;
best-off income quintile, wick lamps and hurricane lamps were extensively used.&#13;

218.     One of the problems of econometric estimation of data from household energy&#13;
surveys (and price elasticities in particular) is that grid-electricity prices are often highly&#13;
distorted by cross-subsidies and the block structure. For example, in Peru, Figure M2.5&#13;
shows the cost per kWh as a function of monthly consumption â&#128;&#147; which also shows&#13;
significant differences between urban and rural tariffs.&#13;

INCOME EFFECTS&#13;
219.      Although such consumer surplus calculations are widely used, several problems&#13;
arise (beyond the merely obvious issue of over-estimation by assuming linearity of the&#13;
demand curve). In fact consumer surplus is known to be a close approximation of exact&#13;
measures only when income elasticities are low and when relatively small price changes&#13;
are being analyzed. Because the demand for electricity typically has very high income&#13;
elasticities for countries with low levels of income, and because it is in just such&#13;
countries that the very large price shifts occur in both the case of rural electrification&#13;
(significant price reductions for electricity over the cost of non-electricity substitutes),&#13;
simple consumer surplus calculations can be an unreliable indicator of welfare changes.&#13;
The same is true when large tariff increases occur following large reductions in&#13;
electricity subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
220.      Bacon92 argues that more precise measures should be used. For a price decrease,&#13;
the compensating variation (CV) is defined as the amount of money that can be taken&#13;
away from the household, with the new prices holding, to leave it as well off as it was&#13;
before the prices altered. Indeed it has been observed in many household energy&#13;
surveys in poorer countries that when the price of lighting falls, households use less&#13;
electricity than the demand curve would predict, preferring to use some of the&#13;
additional disposable income on other goods and services: moreover, the ability of a&#13;
poor household to consume larger amounts of electricity may be constrained by the&#13;
affordability of additional appliances required to deliver increased services (which is the&#13;
rationale for providing CFLs to households free of charge as part of rural solar home&#13;
projects).&#13;

&#13;
  Box M2.1: Using consumer surplus as a measure of benefits: Conclusions of the Yemen Study&#13;
&#13;
Consumer surplus as the measure for estimating benefits of enlarged access by households to&#13;
public electricity supply needs to be used with caution. Consumer surplus benefits from&#13;
increased access to electricity supply may be less than has been postulated in earlier analyses.&#13;
Evidence from Yemen indicates that the demand curve for utilities such as lighting and&#13;
information/entertainment is highly concave.&#13;
&#13;
Consumer surplus associated with induced consumption (e.g. use of additional lights, electric&#13;
fans) may involve consumption of more units of electrical energy than before electrification, but&#13;
the unit value of consumer surplus is small. The primary consumer surplus benefit from&#13;
electrification programs comes from avoided expenditure on substitutes. While the unit value of&#13;
these latter savings may be high, the number of units involved is typically small.&#13;
&#13;
Benefits of increased access to electricity should be measured both in terms of gains in&#13;
consumer surplus and gains in real income from electrification. Analysis of benefits from&#13;
enlarged electricity access often focuses entirely on the consumer surplus benefits. However, the&#13;
avoided expenditures by households on energy forms that are substituted by electricity are likely&#13;
to yield high savings which in effect increase the real incomes of these households. This effect is&#13;
not currently measured in the evaluation of household electrification programs, and its inclusion&#13;
can strengthen the economic case for investment in household electrification.&#13;
&#13;
Plan electrification along with accompanying measures to ease access to electricity consuming&#13;
appliances. Low income households are highly sensitive to energy prices and could therefore be&#13;
reluctant to modify rapidly their patterns of energy consumption once they gain access. Increased&#13;
electricity access does not materialize in a large substitution effect because of householdsâ&#128;&#152; high&#13;
sensitivity to prices as well as to limitations on their ability to afford the purchase of electrical&#13;
appliances.&#13;
&#13;
In other words, access may not translate rapidly in a larger consumption of energy services by&#13;
individual households. Patterns of energy demand evidenced in Yemen indirectly show that the&#13;
cost of electricity consuming appliances may be a stronger barrier to higher consumption of&#13;
electricity among low income households than commonly anticipated.&#13;
&#13;
The energy demand curves for lighting and basic entertainment / information derived from the&#13;
Yemen Household Energy Survey are downward sloping and highly concave, challenging the&#13;
size of the consumer surplus. The shape is consistent with a demand function based on a constant&#13;
and high level of price elasticity, i.e. a function of the form ln(Q) = A + e*ln(P). The coefficient that&#13;
represents the price elasticity of demand for lighting is estimated at -0.81 and for entertainment /&#13;
information is estimated at -0.92. The implications for the benefits associated with new or&#13;
improved access to electricity are twofold: First, while the unit value of savings as a result of&#13;
avoided use of non-electric substitutes may be high, the number of units replaced by access to&#13;
electricity is small. Hence the amount of consumerâ&#128;&#152;s surplus associated with substitution is&#13;
limited.&#13;
&#13;
Second, The amount of consumerâ&#128;&#152;s surplus associated with additional demand induced by access&#13;
to electricity for these two applications is also limited. Because the curve quickly approaches and&#13;
parallels the x-axis, the area between the curve and the rectangle that represents the amount&#13;
actually paid for the electricity (i.e. the Area C in Figure M2.1) is small.&#13;

&#13;
221.    Supply curves are useful tools when correctly derived.      They are particularly&#13;
useful for assessing renewable energy targets on the basis of economic reasoning, rather&#13;
than targets merely reflecting aspirational goals with little understanding of the&#13;
implications of the incremental costs that follow. However, the first prerequisite for their&#13;
construction is a realistic assessment of the resource endowment of all actually available&#13;
renewable energy types: a very detailed supply curve for potential wind projects&#13;
provides little guidance unless one can be sure there are no other renewable resources â&#128;&#147;&#13;
hydro (small and large), geothermal or biomass - that may deliver the same benefits at&#13;
lower cost.&#13;
&#13;
222.     The economic rationale for renewable energy is straightforward: the optimum&#13;
amount of renewable energy for grid-connected generation is given by the intersection&#13;
of the RE supply curve with the avoided cost of thermal electricity generation (Figure&#13;
M3.1). Very little renewable energy will be competitive with the avoided thermal cost if&#13;
that cost is based on financial prices: in almost all Asian countries that have their own&#13;
fossil-fuel resources, subsidized prices to power utilities are widespread. Only where&#13;
the marginal thermal resource is imported (and unsubsidized) oil, will renewable energy&#13;
be competitive (as was the case in Sri Lanka in the early 2000s); where the thermal&#13;
generation price is based on coal, little if any renewable energy will be competitive at&#13;
financial prices.&#13;

223.    If thermal energy is correctly valued at the border price PECON (which equals&#13;
=PFIN+ï?¡, the subsidy), then the optimal quantity of renewable energy increases, as&#13;
depicted in Figure M3.2.&#13;
&#13;
224.    These principles constitute the basis for the original avoided cost tariffs in Sri&#13;
Lanka, Indonesia, and Vietnam. In Sri Lanka, which has no domestic fossil resources,&#13;
the marginal thermal production cost was set by imported diesel fuel, so the acceptance&#13;
of a renewable energy tariff set at this avoided cost was easily achieved in 1998. In&#13;
Vietnam this was more difficult, since at the time of its introduction in 2009 the avoided&#13;
financial cost of thermal generation to the state-owned utility (Electricity of Vietnam,&#13;

generation. But as additional gas-fired combined-cycle-gas-turbine (CCGT) plants came&#13;
online with prices linked to the international prices, EVN accepted a tariff based on the&#13;
cost of the marginal thermal project.&#13;

225.    But even if the cost of fossil energy is correctly valued at the border price, this&#13;
needs to be further adjusted to reflect the local environmental damage costs of fossil&#13;
energyâ&#128;&#148;that is, the damage caused by local air pollutants (PM 10, SOx, NOx), or the&#13;
environmental damage costs associated with coal mining (to the extent these are not&#13;
already reflected in the economic cost of coal supplied to a coal-burning project).&#13;
&#13;
226.     Such environmental damage costs represent real economic costs to the national&#13;
economy, and their avoidance should be reflected as a benefit in the economic analysis&#13;
of renewable energy. In effect, the real social cost of thermal generation is its economic&#13;
price (that is, without subsidy) plus the per kilowatt-hour local environmental damage&#13;
cost (ï?¥ï&#128;©. As shown in Figure M3.3, at this cost PENV = PECON+ ï?¥, the economic quantity of&#13;

227.     In 2003, just this framework was used to underpin the case for renewable energy&#13;
in China, as is summarized in Figure M3.4. The quantity of additional renewable energy&#13;
increases from 79 terawatt-hours (TWh) to 89 TWh when the environmental damage cost&#13;
of coal, estimated at 0.4 yuan/KWh (0.48 cents/KWh), is added to the economic cost of&#13;
coal-fired generation.&#13;

CONSTRUCTING THE SUPPLY CURVE&#13;
228.     The supply curve in Figure M3.5, denoted S1, is based on the levelised cost of&#13;
energy (LCOE) for different renewable projects, and then sorted from least to most&#13;
costly. Each point on the supply curve represents a particular renewable energy project&#13;
at a particular location, whose costs we denote Ri.93 We also show the cost of thermal&#13;
generation, calculated on the same basis. This is shown here for simplicity as a&#13;
horizontal line, assuming that all fossil projects â&#128;&#147; say imported coal or CCGT â&#128;&#147; would all&#13;
have roughly the same LCOE. None of the insights provided by the supply curve&#13;
analysis differ if this were also upward sloping (as would be the case for a domestic&#13;
fossil resource).&#13;

need to be adjusted to reflect the lack of capacity credit for non-dispatchable renewable&#13;

energy. When there are different technologies reflected in the supply curve, each&#13;
technology may require a different adjustment â&#128;&#147; if the comparison were against coal as&#13;
the replaced thermal generation, then the LCOE of geothermal projects needs no further&#13;
adjustment â&#128;&#147; both provide base load. But where wind displaces CCGT, the capacity&#13;
credit may quite small, so one needs to add a capacity penalty to the LCOE to make up&#13;
for its lack of capacity value. The penalties would be lower for small hydro projects&#13;
with storage, especially if its capacity value is enhanced by even a few hours of storage&#13;
that allows it to operate at peak hours.. The calculation of the capacity credit is&#13;
discussed in Technical Note T1.&#13;
&#13;
230.     A revised supply curve, S*, can now be calculated which takes into account for&#13;
each renewable energy project its capacity penalty Xi. The adjusted renewable energy&#13;
cost for the i-th project, Ri*, is:&#13;
      Ri * = R i + X I&#13;
This revised supply curve is illustrated in Figure M3.6&#13;

supply curve S*, as shown in Figure M3.7. The curve S* obviously lies above the curve S1&#13;
â&#128;&#147; since (in this example), all of the renewable energy projects have some kind of capacity&#13;
penalty. Consequently, the intersection of the adjusted supply curve S* with the cost of&#13;
fossil energy that is displaced is now to the left of Q1, at QECON. The latter represents the&#13;
quantity of renewable energy that is economically efficient before consideration of the&#13;
avoided externality costs.&#13;

ISSUES&#13;
232.     For supply curves to be useful several questions need to be asked: The first, as&#13;
noted, is whether the renewable energy cost has been properly adjusted for capacity&#13;
penalty. Second, one needs also to make sure that the cost of the thermal alternative is&#13;
correctly calculated using the border price as the basis for fuel cost (or the relevant&#13;
import parity price).&#13;
&#13;
233.     The above discussion of supply curves presumes that what is being â&#128;&#156;suppliedâ&#128;?&#13;
is a quantity of electricity, so the x-axis portrays kWh (or sometimes MW), with the&#13;
objective being to supply the forecasted amount of electricity needed by the economy at&#13;
least cost. Though based on a similar idea, a â&#128;&#156;marginal abatement costâ&#128;? (MAC) curve is&#13;
however something different, in which the x-axis portrays the quantity of pollutant to be&#13;
removed, such as GHG emissions, or SOx emissions â&#128;&#147;reflecting the objective of a long-&#13;
term objective of GHG emissions reduction. It does not necessarily follow that the&#13;
cheapest option to add kWh is also the cheapest option to reduce GHG.&#13;
&#13;
234.     Moreover, Vogt-Schilb et al (2014) make the point that it does also not follow that&#13;
the cheapest option in a MAC curve should necessarily be implemented first, because&#13;
that may result in carbon-intensive lock-ins that would make it expensive to achieve the&#13;
long-term objective. They propose a different graphical representation (Figure M3.8) to&#13;
illustrate the linkage between the MAC curve and the trajectory of emissions (â&#128;&#156;wedge&#13;
curvesâ&#128;?), and propose an optimisation that accounts for constraints on implementation&#13;
speeds (for Brazil).&#13;

&#13;
235.    Supply curves could be constructed on the basis of financial costs as well, for&#13;
which the relative position of projects may be different to that revealed by the economic&#13;
supply curve. However, one should always start with the economic supply curve, and&#13;
then ask how financial aspects distort the conclusions drawn For example, small hydro&#13;
projects that pay significant water royalties may look less attractive than wind projects&#13;
that pay no â&#128;&#156;windâ&#128;? royalties.&#13;
&#13;
236.    Finally, one may note that supply curves, and the renewable energy targets as&#13;
may follow from a supply curve analysis, are subject to uncertainty. How one deals&#13;
with this problem is discussed in Technical Note C4.&#13;

&#13;
The analytical work on which this note is based is presently being updated in the&#13;
ongoing World Bank project Assessing the Economic Costs of Air Pollution, with the results&#13;
expected to be available in December 2015. This note and its calculations will be revised&#13;
once that work is complete.&#13;

M4      LOCAL DAMAGE COSTS OF FOSSIL GENERATION&#13;
&#13;
238.    The damage costs associated with air pollution constitute an important negative&#13;
externality of thermal generation; and their avoidance in the case of renewable energy,&#13;
energy efficiency, thermal rehabilitation, and loss reduction projects constitute a&#13;
potentially important benefit.&#13;
&#13;
239.     Most of the focus to date has been on the damage costs associated with air&#13;
pollution on human health. A range of other impacts associated with local air pollution&#13;
include damage on crops and forests, and further damages arise from water pollution&#13;
related to coal mining (acid mine drainage), and, at coal projects, from the disposal of&#13;
ash and FGD scrubber sludge. However, these other impacts are generally considered to&#13;
be small by comparison, and in the case of water pollution, extremely difficult to value.&#13;
A US study estimates health damages associated with outdoor air pollution at $100&#13;
billion (at 1990 price levels), damages to field crops at $550 million and damages to&#13;
timber yields at $600 million â&#128;&#147; in other words, health damages are two orders of&#13;
magnitude greater than these other damages.95&#13;
&#13;
240.    Unlike damage cost estimates associated with GHG emissions, for which only&#13;
the quantity of emissions matters, and for which all projects can use the same damage&#13;
cost function,96 local air pollution damage costs are strongly dependent on the location of&#13;
emissions, the complexities of local and regional weather patterns, of the patterns of&#13;
population around a power plant, of the dose-response functions that determine the&#13;
health consequences, and of the valuation of human morbidity and mortality. This&#13;
makes the estimation of damage costs complex.&#13;
&#13;
241.    A large literature documents the impacts of ambient pollution levels on human&#13;
health, and on the methodology of valuing human mortality and morbidity. But&#13;
including such damage costs in the context of a project CBA requires the additional step&#13;
of estimating the incremental change in ambient exposure attributable to the incremental&#13;
emissions of a power project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CALCULATIONS&#13;
242.    High uncertainty characterises every step of the calculations that links&#13;
incremental pollutions emissions from a specific project to its ultimate damage costs.&#13;
There are four main steps in such calculations&#13;
&#13;
(i) Calculation of emissions:&#13;
243.     This is generally straightforward, and will largely be a function of the quality of&#13;
the fuel, the heat rate, and the pollution control technology in place. However, while&#13;
emission factors per kWh for GHG and SO2 are reliably calculated from basic&#13;
stochiometry, those for PM10 and NOx emissions show wide variations, some by an&#13;
order of magnitude (Table M4.1).&#13;

ii) Linking emissions to changes in ambient concentrations:&#13;
244.    In the case of a CBA for a thermal generation project, detailed air quality&#13;
modelling will likely be available as part of the environmental impact assessment which&#13;
takes into account the complexities of dispersion, local weather patterns, and stack&#13;
height. But when the object of a CBA is a renewable energy project, or a T&amp;D loss&#13;
reduction project, whose impact would be to reduce thermal emissions from a variety of&#13;
thermal projects for which such detailed modelling is rarely available, estimating such&#13;
impacts is more difficult (particularly since the marginal project that is displaced may be&#13;
an older project with for which no modern air quality modelling was ever done).&#13;
&#13;
(iii) Linking changes in ambient concentrations to changes in health effects (mortality&#13;
and morbidity)&#13;
245.    Only in very few developing countries are there reliable studies of dose-&#13;
response functions, which require fairly detailed epidemiological and hospital&#13;
admissions data. Indeed, many studies show that a disproportionate number of deaths&#13;
are associated with acute episodes (for example as associated with inversions), and there&#13;
is much uncertainty about thresholds and the functional relationship (linear or on-linear&#13;
above the threshold).&#13;
&#13;
246.    There are many reasons why extrapolation of the relationship of mortality and&#13;
morbidity to ambient concentrations of pollutants do not easily transfer from developed&#13;
countries where such studies are in fact available, to developing countries where&#13;
     ï&#130;· The general level of public health is less good than in developed countries, and&#13;
        so populations are less resistant to the effects of pollution induced health&#13;
        problems;&#13;
     ï&#130;·    In many places, populations spend a greater proportion of time outdoors, and&#13;
          ventilation levels of houses in typical developing countries is much greater than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
         in developed countries â&#128;&#147; so exposure to outdoor ambient concentrations will be&#13;
         greater (and to indoor sources lower);&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Lower incomes limit the more costly avoidance options available in the US or&#13;
         Europe;&#13;
     ï&#130;·   The evidence suggests that the elderly are more sensitive to life-shortening&#13;
         effects of particulates than the young. So developing countries with a much&#13;
         younger age structure may have a lower propensity to premature mortality&#13;
         associated with respiratory diseases.&#13;
&#13;
(iv) Valuation of mortality and morbidity&#13;
247.      Monetising the value of human life is inherently difficult, so it should not&#13;
surprise that estimates show high variation. Country-specific studies of the value of&#13;
statistical life (VSL), used as a basis for valuing deaths caused by pollution, reveal orders&#13;
of magnitude variation: for example as reported by Cropper et al (2012), for India these&#13;
include an estimate of Rs 1.3 million (2006 Rs) based on a stated preference study of&#13;
Delhi residents; Rs 15 million (2007) based on a compensating wage study of workers in&#13;
Calcutta and Mumbai, and a 1990 study of Rs 56 million (in other words a range of&#13;
$30,000 to $1.2 million). Different methods used in recent EU reports vary by a factor of&#13;
three.&#13;
&#13;
248.    It is generally accepted that VSL estimates can be transferred from one country&#13;
to another using the so-called benefits transfer method, which posits that&#13;
                                       ï?¥&#13;
                        ï&#131;¦ YX       ï&#131;¶                                                      Eq.[1]&#13;
         VSL x ï&#128;½ VSLUSA ï&#131;§&#13;
                        ï&#131;§Y&#13;
                                   ï&#131;·&#13;
                                   ï&#131;·&#13;
where                   ï&#131;¨ USA      ï&#131;¸&#13;
VSLX      =      VSL in country x&#13;
YX        =      Per capita income in country x&#13;
ï?¥ï&#128;         =      elasticity (when ï?¥ =1, the ratio of VSL to per capita income is the same in both&#13;
                 countries)&#13;
&#13;
249.    This equation is consistent with a simplified version of the so-called life cycle&#13;
model, which holds that consumption is proportional to per capita income, which in&#13;
turn assumes that people have the same discount rate, survival probabilities and risk&#13;
preferences â&#128;&#147; requirements that are not likely to be strictly true. 97&#13;
&#13;
Comparator selection&#13;
250.      While the above equation may well be valid for adjusting VSL across countries&#13;
(i.e. step 4), it has no relevance to adjusting the relationships of steps 2 and 3. This is&#13;
illustrated in Figure M4.1, which shows damage cost estimates for NOx in various&#13;
European countries as a function of per capita GDP.98&#13;
&#13;
251.     It is clear that the correlation between these two variables is poor, which simply&#13;
illustrates the many other factors that determine damage costs (location, population&#13;
density, dispersion patterns). Adjusting European damage cost estimates from one&#13;
country to another using only the ratio of per capita GDP is therefore unreliable.&#13;
&#13;
252.   Moreover, even within countries there may be large differences in per capita&#13;
income between urban and rural areas: so when assessing, say, the impact of a coal&#13;
burning power plant located near Jakarta, the per capita income for the affected&#13;

        Kingdom or Ireland compared to landlocked countries such as Austria or&#13;
        Hungary.&#13;

&#13;
APPLICATION OF THE BENEFIT-TRANSFER METHOD&#13;
254.    Table M4.1 shows an application of the benefit transfer method for estimating&#13;
the local damage costs of a coal power generation project in Indonesia, using the UK as&#13;
the comparator country. The total avoided local health damage cost â&#128;&#147; say from a&#13;
geothermal project that displaces base load coal - is $1.25 USc/kWh. This compares to&#13;
2.73 USc/kWh as the valuation of avoided GHG emissions based on $30/ton. 101&#13;
&#13;
255.     It is generally acknowledged that the EU Extern-e studies (from which the&#13;
estimates shown in Table M4.2 are based) have generally high valuations of damage&#13;
costs. Indeed, the damage costs based on VSL would be around 2.9 times higher.&#13;

        Europe. Technical Report 15/2011, Luxembourg&#13;
101     Most studies that use this approach make no further adjustments for population density.&#13;
        For the illustrative example used here, we note that the UK population density (2010) is&#13;
        255 persons/km2, as against 126 persons/km2 in Indonesia. But both countries have wide&#13;
        variations in population density (in the UK, high densities in the Southeast, low densities&#13;
        in Scotland; in Indonesia, high density in Java, low density in Kalimantan)&#13;

 256.     If adjusting damage costs per Kg of emissions is difficult, even greater are the&#13;
 hazards of using (or adjusting) estimates specified as $/kWh. For example, Table M4.3&#13;
 shows local externality damage cost estimates for South Africa, developed for use in&#13;
 integrated resource planning (IRP) to evaluate alternative resource plans. In this study,&#13;
 by far the biggest local externality â&#128;&#147; which is a positive externality - derives from the&#13;
 avoidance of indoor air pollution associated with self-generation and kerosene for&#13;
 lighting. It also shows the largest single damage cost is attributable to acid mine&#13;
 drainage.&#13;

 257.     Such average aggregate $/kWh estimates of coal generation damage costs may&#13;
 be useful for IRP, but their application to a project specific CBA is problematic. For any&#13;
 particular displaced coal project, the location, fuel and technology specific factors may&#13;
 account for order of magnitude differences from a national average in damage costs. We&#13;
 would always recommend that the starting point for any damage cost monetisation be a&#13;
 separate calculation for each major pollutant (PM10, SOx, NOx), as based on fuel quality,&#13;
 the emission control performance, and the technology specific heat rate, and expressed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

 102       The EU report provides figures of damage costs for 2010 and 2020, expressed at 2005&#13;
           prices: these are adjusted to 2013 prices in this example.&#13;
 103       Whether these health impacts (which are mainly due to mortality and morbidity in coal&#13;
           mining) should count as an externality is discussed in Technical Note T5.&#13;

258.     These various issues were recognized in a 2000 World Bank study that estimated&#13;
health damage costs from air pollution in six major developing-country cities.104&#13;
Damage costs were estimated per ton of emissions per million affected population and&#13;
per capita GDP, and take into account the height at which emissions are released. This&#13;
study is currently being updated, but the new damage cost estimates (Table M4.5) also&#13;
take into account the average air quality into which the incremental emissions are&#13;
emitted: the incremental damage costs of an additional kg emitted into relatively pristine&#13;
air-shed will be higher than those emitted in already highly polluted airsheds: this is&#13;
illustrated in Figure M4.2, which shows damage costs per kg of PM10 as a function of the&#13;
annual average PM2.5 concentration (in the case of the upper end of the range of&#13;
emissions of typical grid-connected power project with a high stack).&#13;

evident from the data presented in Table M4.6: major cities typically have much higher&#13;
pollution levels than the country averages. Typically, new coal projects are built in&#13;
relatively rural areas, for which the national averages may be used.&#13;

261.         The following should be noted:&#13;
                 ï&#130;· The basis for the health damage valuation (the VSL USA in Eq.[1]) is set at&#13;
                     $5.46 million at 2009 prices. If the country (or city) per capita GDP is&#13;
                     stated for, say, 2013, then the damage costs in row [1] must be first&#13;
                     escalated to 2013 (using the US GDP deflator), as shown in row [2]. The&#13;
                     per capita GDP estimate should be at market exchange rates, not&#13;
                     purchase-power-parity adjusted.&#13;
                 ï&#130;· The typical Indonesia power plant on Java is located on the coast&#13;
                     relatively distant from Jakarta: hence the average population density&#13;
                     and per capita GDP is used (row [6])&#13;
                 ï&#130;· Absent specific information about prevailing wind directions and&#13;
                     population distributions in the vicinity of the project in question, no&#13;
                     adjustment is made in row [8]. On a monsoonal Island, it could well be&#13;
                     that for almost half the year the prevailing wind direction blows&#13;
                     emissions out to sea (see Figure M4.3).&#13;
&#13;
262.    The total local damage cost is 0.045 USc/kWh. This compares to the damage&#13;
costs of 2.73 USc/kWh for GHG emissions (assuming $30/ton CO2). Nevertheless, as&#13;
calculated in rows [18]-[24], the total damage cost for a typical 1,000 MW coal-based&#13;
power plant is $3.56 million per year. Indonesia has a target of some 6,000 MW of&#13;

&#13;
geothermal generation by 2025: the health benefit of achieving this target would&#13;
therefore be $21 million per year.&#13;
263.     Location is everything. For the same 1,000 MW coal project were it located in&#13;
Jakarta itself, the annual damage cost computes to around $100 million (1.4 USc/kWh);&#13;
old plants with poorly functioning pollution controls would have damage costs 3-4 times&#13;
this amount.&#13;
&#13;
264.    Useful guidance on population exposure can also be derived from wind data:&#13;
Figure M4.3 shows wind roses for some Indonesian locations, all of which show a highly&#13;
unequal distribution of prevailing winds, with obvious implications for the number of&#13;
persons likely to be affected by local air pollutants.&#13;

LOCAL DAMAGE COST STUDIES&#13;
265.    The value of local health damage studies is illustrated by Cropper and others,&#13;
who estimated the damage costs of coal fired power generation in India (Table M4.8).&#13;
The total damage cost from human mortality calculates to 1.11 USc/kWh.&#13;

Avoided damage costs from self generation&#13;
266.   In many cases, the most significant local health benefits from power sector&#13;
emissions will be from avoided self-generation: the Tarbela Hydro extension project,&#13;

  designed to reduce extensive summer peak power shortages, is an example here. 105 The&#13;
  main question is the size of the affected population.&#13;
&#13;
  267.     Table M4.9 shows damage cost estimates for such self-generation in Indonesia,&#13;
  assuming that 1,000 MW of total diesel self generation capacity would be avoided in&#13;
  Jakarta. Assuming an average generator size of 1 MW, 1,000 self-generators would be&#13;
  displaced. Each has a zone of influence of radius 200 metres, so the total affected area is&#13;
  12.6 km2. The per capita GDP in Jakarta is taken as twice the national average. The total&#13;
  local air pollution damage cost calculates to 1.67USc/kWh, 37 times greater than of the&#13;
  coal project in East Java. Unlike the case of grid-connected coal generation, the local&#13;
  damage costs are comparable to the avoided GHG damage costs (of 1.8USc/kWh).&#13;

  Avoided cost tariffs for renewable energy&#13;
  268.     The question of avoided local environmental damage costs has been raised by&#13;
  Governments formulating avoided cost tariffs for renewable energy, but this has been&#13;
  hampered by the question of the reliability of the estimates. In Vietnam, the regulator&#13;
  (ERAV) concluded there were no credible, Vietnam-specific damage cost estimates&#13;
  available for a corresponding charge to be included in Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s avoided cost tariff. In&#13;
  Indonesia, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) included a small â&#128;&#156;de&#13;
  minimusâ&#128;? charge 0.1 USc/kWh charge in the new avoided cost tariff for geothermal&#13;
  projects issued in June 2014, on grounds that the damage costs were not likely to be zero,&#13;

but that a de minimus charge would serve as a placeholder until such time as a reliable&#13;
study for Indonesia was available.&#13;
&#13;
269.    However, even were such country specific studies available, there are still too&#13;
many uncertainties (and too much geographical variability) for a reliable premium to be&#13;
included in a renewable energy tariff. From a broader policy perspective, the control of&#13;
ambient air pollution levels from thermal power projects is best achieved directly&#13;
through suitable emission standards and their strict enforcement, rather than indirectly&#13;
(and with considerable uncertainty) through renewable energy tariffs.&#13;

Best Practice recommendations 13: Local air pollution damage costs&#13;
(1)      Proceed with care. The range of uncertainty is high. A prudent and&#13;
conservative approach when calculating benefits of renewable energy projects would be&#13;
to use the lower bound estimates of Table M4.5; when estimating the externality costs of&#13;
thermal projects one may use the higher bound estimates. In the case of gas projects, the&#13;
avoided local damage costs, and the resulting impact on the NPV calculations, will be&#13;
quite small, and rarely worth any extensive data collection. However, prudence requires&#13;
that such the calculations should always be presented where coal projects are affected&#13;
&#13;
(3)      In the absence of relevant country specific sources, use the updated damage cost&#13;
estimates in the Six Cities study as the starting point (Table M4.5), following the sample&#13;
calculation of Table M4.7. For a reliable calculation, this will require items of&#13;
information not customarily collected for an economic analysis, including population&#13;
distributions around thermal power plants whose output is assumed to be backed down&#13;
by a renewable energy project; and any environmental impact assessments that would&#13;
have been prepared for newer thermal facilities which provide much detailed&#13;
information.&#13;
&#13;
(3)    In the calculation of damage costs in the table of economic flows (see Annex A4),&#13;
the damage costs should be escalated each year by the rate of GDP growth.&#13;

&#13;
Background&#13;
270.      The Bank has issued guidelines for GHG accounting to be used in renewable&#13;
energy generation projects.106 Although these guidelines include an EXCEL tool to&#13;
facilitate the calculations, the use of the tool use is optional, provided the calculations&#13;
follow the essential methodology points of the Guidance note. We recommend that&#13;
GHG accounting be integrated into the calculations for the economic analysis, but&#13;
following the principles of the GHG accounting note.&#13;
&#13;
271.     In September 2014 the Bank also issued a Guidance Note on the value of carbon&#13;
in project appraisal107 the note suggests that the economic analysis be done with and&#13;
without the social value of carbon. The â&#128;&#156;baseâ&#128;? values suggested (Table M5.1) are very&#13;
close to the values used by the European Investment Bank (EIB). 108&#13;

EMISSION FACTORS&#13;
272.   Absent detailed information about the specific characteristics of fossil fuels,&#13;
IPCC default values for CO2 emissions from combustion may be used (Table M5.2).&#13;

&#13;
273.    Heat values for the IPCC defaults are on a net calorific basis (i.e. LHV).&#13;
Consequently when calculating emission per kWh, efficiencies and heat rates should also&#13;
be specified on an LHV basis.&#13;

108     However (according to the guidance note), the EIB values appear to have been chosen â&#128;&#156;to&#13;
        include the carbon prices that would be needed to make the EU long-term&#13;
        decarbonisation targets viableâ&#128;?. In other words, the EIB values are not the result of some&#13;
        economic reasoning and modeling, but simply chosen to meet a politically correct result&#13;
        (â&#128;&#156;Because several lignite-fired power generation projects previously passed the economic&#13;
        viability test even with high carbon prices, the EIB shareholders decided to raise the bar&#13;
        for coal projectsâ&#128;?).&#13;

276.     Table M5.5 shows the corresponding impact on the variable cost of a coal&#13;
project. When the world crude oil price is around $70/bbl, the coal price will be around&#13;
$64/ton, and the variable cost of generation (in a supercritical plant) will be around 2.3&#13;
USc/kWh. At $30/ton CO2, the total cost will be 2.73 USc/kWh (from Table M5.2) plus&#13;
the 2.3 USc/kWh, for a total of 5USc/kWh â&#128;&#147; in other words, roughly double.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Avoided GHG emissions&#13;
277.    Following the simplified UNFCCC methodologies for calculating avoided&#13;
carbon emissions, many of the worked examples in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s new GHG accounting&#13;
guidelines use â&#128;&#156;average grid emission factorsâ&#128;?. That may be appropriate in certain&#13;
circumstances where data is limited, but the reality of merit order dispatch is that when&#13;
an additional kWh of electricity is injected into the grid, emissions are not reduced by&#13;
the grid average. Nor do dispatchers pay any attention to the UNFCCC constructs of&#13;
â&#128;&#156;build marginsâ&#128;? and â&#128;&#156;operating marginsâ&#128;?. Rather, the project that gets backed down i s&#13;
that project with the most expensive variable cost. Therefore in a system that has coal&#13;
(baseload) and gas (peak and intermediate) generation, renewable energy first displaces&#13;
open cycle gas turbines, then combined cycle, and only very rarely coal.&#13;
&#13;
278.      Where a project lies in the merit order will depend on a combination of its heat&#13;
rate and its fuel price â&#128;&#147; which may vary from plant to plant. Even if the relevant fuel&#13;
price for economic analysis is the border price, the plant that is actually backed down&#13;
first is decided by the variable financial cost as seen by the dispatcher.&#13;
&#13;
LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS&#13;
279.    The minimum mandatory requirement under the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s carbon accounting&#13;
guidelines is the calculation of GHG emissions from combustion (â&#128;&#156;operational emissions&#13;
within the project boundaryâ&#128;?). An â&#128;&#156;optionalâ&#128;? calculation is to also include upstream&#13;
emissions associated with fuel supply and transport, and to report total â&#128;&#156;life-cycle&#13;
emissions.â&#128;? Other authorities are unequivocal about the need to include life -cycle&#13;
impacts: â&#128;&#156;ignoring this will lead to wrong assessments and misperceptions about the&#13;
environmental credentials of a fuel, a technology or a productâ&#128;? 109&#13;
&#13;
280.     Many RE projects replace gas-fired generation in CCGT based on LNG. GHG&#13;
emissions from LNG combustion are much lower than from coal (per kWh, due to high&#13;
efficiencies), but it is generally accepted that upstream emissions associated with LNG&#13;
liquefaction, transportation (over often very long distances) and regasification together&#13;
increase total GHG emissions by as much as 20%. For example, the Japanese study&#13;
estimates combustion emissions of 407 gm/kWh, fuel cycle emissions add another 111&#13;
gm/kWh (Figure M5.6). The avoidance of such life-cycle emissions is a significant&#13;
additional benefit of renewable energy, which should be recognised in the economic&#13;
flows. However, if life-cycle emissions are used, they should be applied consistently,&#13;
including for RE projects (particularly for large concrete dams in the case of hydro).&#13;

281.    The most comprehensive study in the literature of life-cycle emissions in the&#13;
LNG value chain is that by Heede for the Cabrillo deepwater port that was part of a&#13;
proposal for an LNG project in California (importing LNG from Australia).110 This&#13;
study shows that consideration of the LNG supply chains adds some 38% to the GHG&#13;
combustion emissions of both CO2 and methane (Table M5.6).111&#13;

282.      Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) have been criticized for their variability and&#13;
reliability, with assessments for some technologies spanning on order of magnitude in&#13;
some cases. This variability can be attributed to the specific characteristics of the&#13;
technologies evaluated (e.g., differing system designs, commercial versus conceptual&#13;
systems, system operating assumptions, technology improvements over time) and LCA&#13;
methods and assumptions. Analysts at NREL have developed and applied a systematic&#13;
approach to review the LCA literature, identify primary sources of variability and,&#13;
where possible, reduce variability in GHG emissions estimates through a procedure&#13;

          fracking revolution in the US means that the anticipated need for LNG imports has been&#13;
          replaced by the possibility of LNG exports.&#13;
111       For combustion emissions of 16.5million tons, there are supply chain emissions of 6.3&#13;
          million tons, so for every kg of GHG emissions in combustion, there is an additional&#13;
          6.3/16.5=0.38Kg from the supply chain.&#13;

called â&#128;&#156;harmonization.â&#128;? This methodology is based on a two-step meta-analytical&#13;
approach, which statistically combines the results of multiple studies, as follows:&#13;
  ï&#130;· Systematic Literature Review. NREL considered more than 2,100 published LCA&#13;
     studies on utility-scale electricity generation from wind, solar photovoltaic (PV),&#13;
     concentrating solar power (CSP), biomass, geothermal, ocean energy, hydropower,&#13;
     nuclear, natural gas, and coal technologies. Systematic review, comprising three&#13;
     rounds of screening by multiple experts, narrowed the field to select references that&#13;
     met strict criteria for quality, relevance, and transparency. Less than 15% of the&#13;
     original pool of references passed this review process.&#13;
  ï&#130;· Harmonization and Data Analysis. After the systematic review, NREL applied&#13;
     harmonization to adjust the published GHG emission estimates to a consistent set of&#13;
     methods and assumptions, specific to the technology under investigation, in two&#13;
     main stages: System harmonization ensured studies used a consistent set of included&#13;
     processes (e.g., system boundary, set of evaluated GHGs) and metrics (e.g., global&#13;
     warming potentials). Technical harmonization of key performance parameters (e.g.,&#13;
     capacity factor, thermal efficiency) or primary energy resource characteristics (e.g.,&#13;
     solar resource, fossil fuel heating value) ensured consistent values that reflect a&#13;
     modern reference system (typically a modern facility operating in the United States).&#13;
283.   To date, NREL has completed harmonization of life cycle GHG emissions for&#13;
wind, PV, CSP, nuclear, and coal technologies, with analysis of natural gas technologies&#13;
forthcoming. Table M5.7 shows the NREL harmonized values assessed to date.&#13;

CARBON FINANCE&#13;
284.     In Box C1.2 we presented switching values for carbon for South Africa, which&#13;
can be compared to the social value of carbon in Table M5.1. Indeed, as noted in&#13;
Technical Note M1 (Sensitivity Analysis), calculation of carbon switching values is one&#13;
of the minimum requirements for power sector projects that potentially incur&#13;
incremental costs in the interest of carbon emission reduction. However, that switching&#13;
value calculation tells only part of the story, and should also be accompanied by a&#13;
calculation of the incremental carbon finance requirement.&#13;
&#13;
285.    Table M5.8 shows the analysis of switching values and incremental carbon&#13;
finance requirement for the Medupi coal project. The capital costs (total financial cost)&#13;
have been adjusted so that all of the alternatives produce the same amount of energy as&#13;
&#13;

Medupi (which in the case of wind is without adjustment for any capacity penalty). So&#13;
the wind or CSP equivalents would require a total up-front financial resources of&#13;
between $46.3 - $48.7, compared to $14.8 billion for Medupi. This implies an additional&#13;
carbon finance requirement of $31.5 - $33.9 billion, an amount that is clearly far beyond&#13;
what is actually available to South Africa. It illustrates the fundamental problem of the&#13;
transition to a low-carbon power sector for developing countries. Even nuclear power at&#13;
current costs requires capital outlays of more than double that for coal.&#13;

MARGINAL ABATEMENT COSTS&#13;
286.     There is often confusion about the difference between marginal abatement cost&#13;
(MAC) as calculated for Clean Technology Fund (CTF) projects, and the avoided carbon&#13;
cost as a switching value (i.e. that value of carbon that brings the NPV to zero, and the&#13;
ERR to the hurdle rate).112 CTF requires that funding goes only to projects whose MAC&#13;
is less than $200/ton CO2 as set out in the 2008 IEA Energy Technologies Perspectives&#13;
Report. 113&#13;
&#13;
287.   This report does not in fact contain a rigorous definition of MAC (Annex E of the&#13;
IEA report on definitions is silent on MAC). The report also states, in Annex B,&#13;
somewhat unhelpfully, that&#13;

&#13;
112        There is also confusion about the difference between a supply curve and a MAC. The&#13;
           former plots cost against the cumulative development impact (GWh or MW additions),&#13;
           the latter against the cumulative amount of pollutant that can be abated (see also&#13;
           Technical Note M3 and the discussion of Figure M3.8).&#13;
113        The relevant CTF regulation states:&#13;
           Each project/program proposal will include a calculation of the CTF investment per ton of&#13;
           CO2-equivalent reduced. In order to ensure the greatest impact of the CTFâ&#128;&#153;s limi ted resources,&#13;
           CTF co-financing will ordinarily not be available for investments in which the marginal cost of&#13;
           reducing a ton of CO2-equivalent exceeds US$200, which according to the International&#13;
           Energy Agencyâ&#128;&#153;s Energy Technology Perspectives 2008 Report, is the lower-end estimate of&#13;
           the incentive needed to achieve the objectives of the â&#128;&#156;BLUE Map Scenarioâ&#128;?&#13;

&#13;
       The abatement cost curve does not really represent marginal cost/marginal CO2 effects,&#13;
       because oil and gas prices are static, while they change in the ACT and BLUE&#13;
       scenarios.&#13;
288.    The report notes that the MAC depends on the discount rate used, but it is not&#13;
clear what discount rate is used for the curve presented in the IEA Executive Summary&#13;
where the $200/ton figure used by CTF is mentioned. Most likely it is 10%.&#13;

289.      Most CTF projects define MAC as&#13;
&#13;
                    NPV&#13;
         MAC ï&#128;½&#13;
                   LGHG&#13;
&#13;
Where LGHG is the undiscounted estimate of lifetime GHG emissions, and NPV is the&#13;
net present value of the benefit stream. It necessarily follows that the MAC is a function&#13;
of the discount rate.&#13;
&#13;
290.    The resulting values of MAC will be much lower than the calculation of&#13;
switching value. Table M5.9 shows the values of MAC and switching value for CO2&#13;

Consistency&#13;
291.     Economic analysis requires the evaluation of alternatives, which in the case of a&#13;
proposed renewable energy project means:&#13;
     (1) The no project alternative â&#128;&#147; which means treating the additional grid-connected&#13;
         electricity as incremental, with benefits based on WTP, and the alternative being&#13;
         self-generation (or in the case of lighting, based on lighting kerosene).&#13;
     (2) Comparisons with other alternatives (to demonstrate the project is the least cost&#13;
         option for meeting the incremental demand): for example, in the case of&#13;
         Indonesian geothermal project, against base load coal; or in the case of a North&#13;
         African CSP, against imported LNG CCGT.&#13;
&#13;
292.    The displaced GHG emissions will be different in these two cases. For the no&#13;
project alternative, the relevant avoided emissions are the avoided emissions from&#13;
kerosene (lighting), diesel and HFO (for industrial self-gen); and for the comparison with&#13;
other grid-generation options, the calculations will be according to the estimates of the&#13;
various thermal projects displaced.&#13;
&#13;

                                           projects&#13;
In the ideal case when power systems modelling is available (e.g. from WASP), the avoided GHG&#13;
emissions should be calculated from the mix of displaced thermal energy as calculated by the&#13;
model (as the difference between the â&#128;&#156;withâ&#128;? and â&#128;&#156;without projectâ&#128;? runs). The composition of the&#13;
displaced energy will rarely be constant over time: as shown in the figure, in the case of the&#13;
NoorII&amp;III CSP projects, in the first few years mainly oil is displaced, then LNG in years following,&#13;
and in later years even some coal. The annual energy displaced is one of the standard WASP&#13;
model outputs, which is easily imported into the economic analysis spreadsheet, wherein GHG&#13;
emissions can then be calculated.&#13;

Best Practice recommendation 14: GHG accounting&#13;
(1) For renewable energy projects, GHG accounting should be conducted as part of the&#13;
economic analysis, and integrated into the spreadsheet that calculates the economic&#13;
returns. Combustion emissions of the avoided thermal alternative are generally&#13;
sufficient, but where the counter-factual is LNG in CCGT, an additional calculation of&#13;
the life-cycle emissions (and corresponding changes in EIRR) should also be included.&#13;
NREL harmonised LCA values may be used as a reliable source.&#13;
&#13;
(2) Both MAC and switching values should be calculated, and presented in a table of the&#13;
general format shown above in Table M5.9.&#13;
&#13;
(3) GHG emissions from new hydro reservoirs are discussed in the special GHG&#13;
guidance document issued by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water Department.&#13;

M6      MULTI-ATTRIBUTE DECISION ANALYSIS&#13;
&#13;
293.      Multi-attribute decision analysis (MADA) encompasses a set of tools designed to&#13;
facilitate an understanding of trade-offs between multiple objectives that cannot be&#13;
combined into a single attribute. However, this approach does require that each&#13;
objective be captured by a numerical indicator â&#128;&#147; such as NPV to measure the&#13;
performance of the economic efficiency objective, or lifetime GHG emissions to measure&#13;
the performance of the climate change attribute. For many environmental attributes this&#13;
may not be straight-forward, since scales and utility functions may not be linear, and&#13;
may involve thresholds.114&#13;
&#13;
294.    The first use of MADA in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s power sector planning work was to&#13;
examine the trade-offs between return (expected value of generation cost) and risk.115&#13;
This was followed by work in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Environment Department to illustrate trade-&#13;
offs with environmental objectives in Sri Lanka.116 This methodology was subsequently&#13;
adopted in 1998 for a major World Bank study on environmental issues in the Indian&#13;
power sector, which included detailed assessments for the States of Rajasthan and&#13;
Karnataka.117 Such techniques were long part of the integrated resource planning (IRP)&#13;
procedures adopted by many utility regulatory commissions in North America in the&#13;
1990s, based on the pioneering work of Ralph Keeney and Howard Raiffa.118&#13;
&#13;
295.     More recent applications in the Bank include a 2009 study of alternatives to coal-&#13;
based power generation in Sri Lanka, and an economic analysis of the controversial&#13;
Medupi coal-fired project in South Africa. The academic literature on MADA&#13;
applications has grown rapidly since 2000: Wallenius and others119 found 267 MADA&#13;
studies in the energy and water resources literature.&#13;
&#13;
An example&#13;

analysis. 120 It defined the following non-monetized attributes to complement the usual&#13;

                                297.     When framing such attributes, the first priority is to make sure that the attribute&#13;
                                is a meaningful indicator of the underlying goal. For example, the simplest proxy for&#13;
                                local air emissions is tons emitted per yearâ&#128;&#148;now a routine output of most power&#13;
                                systems models. But tons of emissions say very little about actual impacts on human&#13;
                                health, or about the costsâ&#128;&#148;fiscal, social, and other â&#128;&#148;of health care. In the case of GHG&#13;
                                emissions, it matters not where in the world the emission takes place, but in the case of&#13;
                                local pollutants such as particulate matter, where and at what height the emission takes&#13;
                                place is of crucial importance. One kg of PM10 emitted at ground level by a diesel bus in&#13;
                                the centre of Colombo has an impact on human health several orders of magnitude&#13;
                                greater than a kg of PM10 emitted from a tall utility stack in a remote and sparsely&#13;
                                populated area (and where most emissions are in any event blown out to sea). 122 The&#13;
                                difference between gross emissions, and population-weighted SO2 emissions as a more&#13;
                                meaningful proxy for actual damage costs, is illustrated in Figure M6.1. When location is&#13;
                                taken into account, even though gross emissions increase (with the addition of many&#13;
                                new coal projects), damage costs will decrease as the location shifts to less densely&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
299.    Each quadrant of Figure M6.2 contains different types of projects:&#13;
        ï&#130;· Quadrant I contains solutions best described as â&#128;&#156;lose-loseâ&#128;?â&#128;&#148;options that have&#13;
          higher emissions and higher costs. Typical options in this quadrant would be&#13;
          those involving fossil-fuel price subsidies (assuming the baseline is at&#13;
          economic prices), or building subcritical coal units (if the baseline includes&#13;
          supercritical units).123&#13;
        ï&#130;· Quadrant II contains solutions involving trade-offsâ&#128;&#148;costs decrease, but&#13;
          emissions increase. Not installing flue gas desulphurization (FGD), or use of&#13;
          pumped storage, are two options that typically occupy this quadrant. 124&#13;
        ï&#130;· Quadrant III contains solutions that are â&#128;&#156;win-win,â&#128;? of which demand-side&#13;
          management (DSM) and reduction in transmission and distribution (T&amp;D)&#13;
          losses are typical examples. Here both attributes improve â&#128;&#148;that is,&#13;
          characterised by both lower emissions and lower economic costs.&#13;
        ï&#130;· Quadrant IV again contains options that require a trade-offâ&#128;&#148;emissions&#13;
          decrease but only at an increased cost. Renewable energy options and the&#13;
          substitution of coal by liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typical options to be&#13;
          found here.&#13;
&#13;
300.    The figure also shows the â&#128;&#156;trade-off curve.â&#128;? This is defined as the set of non-&#13;
dominated options. Option B is said to be dominated by option A, if option A is better&#13;
than B in both attributes. Thus, in Figure M6.2, DSM dominates the baselineâ&#128;&#148;and&#13;
because it is better in both attributes, a rational decision maker would never prefer the&#13;
baseline over DSM. Intuitively, one may say that options that lie on this trade-off curve&#13;
are â&#128;&#156;closestâ&#128;? to the origin, but they all require trade-offs.&#13;
&#13;
301.     If, as in this illustrative example, there is a sharp corner in the trade-off curve&#13;
(the so-called â&#128;&#156;knee setâ&#128;?), the option that occupies that corner (or one that may be close&#13;
to it) would receive special attention. In this example, â&#128;&#156;no pollution controlsâ&#128;? has&#13;
greater emissions than DSM, but only a very small cost advantage â&#128;&#148;so a decision maker&#13;
would have to give enormous weight to cost and almost no weight at all to emissions to&#13;
&#13;
123     Subcritical units have lower efficiencies than supercritical units. However supercritical&#13;
        units are generally available only in very large sizes (500 MW), so they are not always&#13;
        appropriate for smaller system.&#13;
124     If the pumping energy is provided by base-load coal, then every kWh of pumped storage&#13;
        peaking power will have higher GHG emissions than if the same peaking energy were&#13;
        provided by gas turbine units.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
September 2015                                                                               128&#13;

&#13;
choose this option. Similarly, â&#128;&#156;renewable energyâ&#128;? (as drawn here) has only slightly&#13;
lower emissions, but a much higher cost than DSM â&#128;&#148;so again, to prefer renewable&#13;
energy over DSM would require that huge weight be given to emissions, and not much&#13;
to cost. Not all trade-off plots have such knee sets, or even any win-win options, in&#13;
which case decisions are more difficult to make.&#13;
&#13;
302.    Figure M6.3 shows a trade-off plot for Vietnam, depicting the performance of&#13;
various power sector options on the attributes of cost and GHG emissions. Trung Son is&#13;
a World Bankâ&#128;&#147;financed 260 megawatt (MW) hydro project.125 The baseline in this case,&#13;
which defines the quadrants, is the least-cost capacity expansion plan without Trung Son.&#13;
The system cost and GHG emissions are plotted relative to the baseline: negative&#13;
amounts indicate improvements to the objectives (cost reductions, GHG emission&#13;
reductions).&#13;
&#13;
303.    In the lose-lose quadrant of Figure M6.3 are scenarios in which the assumed&#13;
availability of domestic gas in the baseline is not realized, and must therefore be&#13;
replaced either by imported LNG, or by coal plus pumped storage to meet the&#13;
intermediate and peaking demand of the system.&#13;

304.   In the trade-off quadrant is windâ&#128;&#148;which in Vietnam is expensive (because the&#13;
wind regime is at best modest), though it does of course reduce GHG emissions.&#13;
&#13;
305.     Trung Son is in the win-win quadrant by virtue of lower lifetime power&#13;
production costs, and lower GHG emissions since it displaces gas-fired combined-cycle&#13;
plants. Also in the win-win quadrant are non-wind renewables: â&#128;&#156;Renewables to Peconâ&#128;?&#13;
refers to the point at which the avoided social cost of thermal generation intersects the&#13;
renewable energy supply curve, which defines the optimal level of renewable energy. 126&#13;
Most of this win-win renewable energy in Vietnam is small hydro and bagasse. DSM&#13;

127      In other words, DSM is not, strictly speaking, a mutually exclusive option (in the sense of&#13;
         the old OP10.04 guidelines for economic analysis): rather, it is a complement to supply-side&#13;
         options, and is part of any portfolio of win-win options.&#13;

&#13;
306.     Monte Carlo Simulation is a useful technique for quantitative risk assessment.&#13;
The basic idea is that since the individual assumptions in a CBA are not known with&#13;
certainty, they are better treated as random variables distributed according to some&#13;
probability distribution. The ERR calculation is repeated a large number of times&#13;
(typically 5,000-10,000), at each calculation taking different values for each of the random&#13;
variables, and thereby generating a probability distribution of the ERR. From this&#13;
distribution one may calculate the probability of not reaching the hurdle rate. 128&#13;
&#13;
Specifying probability distributions&#13;
307.     Some of the required probability distributions can be derived directly from&#13;
resource data. For example to assess hydrology risk, one can use the annual energy&#13;
generation from the reservoir operations simulation model for each year of the&#13;
hydrology record â&#128;&#147; in Figure M7.1 illustrated with the distribution of annual generation&#13;
in a Vietnamese small hydro project.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
308.    The extent to which variations in the variables are themselves correlated needs&#13;
to be considered (which means that multivariate probability density functions may be&#13;
required). Fortunately, in most cases of renewable energy project appraisal, the main&#13;
input assumptions are independent: for example, there is little reason to believe that the&#13;
world oil price, hydrology variation, and the pattern of construction cost overruns are&#13;
correlated â&#128;&#147; so the probability distributions for these variables can reasonably be&#13;
assumed to be independent.&#13;
&#13;
309.     However, a good example of variables likely to be correlated is the relationship&#13;
between construction cost overruns and delays: long project delays often also increase&#13;
capital costs â&#128;&#147; as in Indian hydro projects, shown in Figure M7.2. 129&#13;

310.      Hydrology records always need careful scrutiny, as shown by the inflow record&#13;
for typical Vietnamese small hydro projects in Figure M7.3: clearly there is an additional&#13;
risk here that the downward inflow trend is a reflection of basin management issues,&#13;
rather than a long-term cycle that would eventually return to the long-term average.&#13;
Moreover, the relationship between inflows and generation is not linear: once a facility&#13;
is built, extra flow available in wet years is spilled (no change in generation), but in dry&#13;
years generation falls â&#128;&#147; a good example of downside risk. 130&#13;

312.                             The rationale for the hypothesised distributions is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
                    ï&#130;·           World Oil Price: Given that the likelihood of higher oil prices is greater than of&#13;
                                lower oil prices, skewed to the right.131&#13;
                    ï&#130;·           Capital cost: skewed to the right, given the experience that capital cost estimates&#13;
                                tend to be higher than assumed at appraisal, rather than lower than assumed.&#13;
                    ï&#130;·           Consumer Willingness to Pay (WTP): skewed to the left of the baseline estimate,&#13;
                                reflecting the downside risk associated with small sample surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
131                             The recent collapse of the international oil price (since this analysis was prepared in 2012)&#13;
                                demonstrates the difficulties of making such probability statements about future oil&#13;
                                prices. For this reason the RDM approach described in Technical Note C4 (and the&#13;
                                scenario discovery process used in the climate risk assessment of the Nepal Upper Arun&#13;
                                hydro project) has the important advantage that it requires no prior probability&#13;
                                assumptions to assess the vulnerability of proposed investment decisions.&#13;

&#13;
      ï&#130;·      Commercial operation date (COD): specified as the probability of delay in the&#13;
             operating date under the (worst case) assumption that the entire investment has&#13;
             already been made at the start of the delay (as discussed in the previous section).&#13;
             These delays vary from zero (i.e. no delay, the most likely) to increasingly longer&#13;
             delays, to a maximum of 4 years.&#13;
      ï&#130;·      Annual generation (as long term average): The probability distribution shown&#13;
             reflects the actual historical variation in annual generation. This is not a smooth&#13;
             distribution, but is representative of the outcomes of the actual inflow&#13;
             hydrology.&#13;
      ï&#130;·      Climate change impact, specified as the annual rate of decline in annual generation.&#13;
             Negative values imply an increase in generation (recall that some studies&#13;
             suggest increases in wet season precipitation an inflows, implying the possibility&#13;
             of higher than forecast wet season generation). However, as can be seen in&#13;
             Figure M7.4, such outcomes are assumed to be relatively less likely than decreases&#13;
             in generation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
313.      The resulting probability distribution of ERR is shown in Figure M7.5. The&#13;
probability that returns (assessed against CCGT) fall below the hurdle rate is a low 2.4%&#13;
(i.e. the area under the curve to the left of the 12% hurdle rate).&#13;

316.     Monte Carlo simulation is most reliable where many of the input assumptions&#13;
are indeed readily defined as probability distributions (input hydrology in hydro&#13;
projects, forced outage rates at thermal generation projects, distribution of construction&#13;
costs). But some argue that making probabilistic assumptions related to assumptions&#13;
such as the future oil price tend to be arbitrary, and that scenario analysis may be more&#13;
effective to explore the implications of uncertain futures.&#13;

317.     Mean-variance portfolio theory is one of the best-known models in finance, best&#13;
illustrated by simple example. Suppose there are two stocks, A and B, which have&#13;
expected returns of EA and EB, and standard deviations of returns ï?³A and ï?³B. Then a&#13;
portfolio of these two stocks, held in the proportions XA and XB, would have an expected&#13;
portfolio return, E(P) of&#13;
&#13;
        E(P) = XA EA + XB EB                                                                                                  Eq.[1]&#13;
&#13;
i.e. the weighted average of the expected returns.&#13;
&#13;
318.     The portfolio risk, ï?³P, is also a weighted average of the risk of the individual&#13;
securities, but adjusted for the correlation between the two returns:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        ï?³ P ï&#128;½ XA&#13;
               2&#13;
                 ï?³A&#13;
                  2&#13;
                    ï&#128;« XB&#13;
                       2&#13;
                         ï?³B&#13;
                          2&#13;
                            ï&#128;« 2 X A X B ï?² ABï?³ Aï?³ B&#13;
&#13;
where ï?²AB is the correlation coefficient between the returns of A and B.&#13;
319.     Figure M8.1 plots expected return and expected portfolio risk for combinations&#13;
of the two stocks, ranging from portfolio W (100% stock B) to portfolio X (100% stock A).&#13;
The maximum return is indeed portfolio W (100% stock B), but the minimum risk&#13;
portfolio is a combination of 30%A and 70%B. Clearly it makes no sense for an investor&#13;
to hold portfolios Z or X, which have lower returns than Y, and higher risk. Thus the&#13;
â&#128;&#156;efficientâ&#128;? portfolios lie between Y and W (shown as the bold section of the curve in&#13;
Figure M8.1); this defines the highest earning portfolio for any given level of risk.&#13;

320.    The effect of adding riskless assets to this portfolio of stocks A and B, which in a&#13;
financial portfolio generally means US Treasury Bills or government bonds, has&#13;
profound implications. T-bills are not totally risk-free because their value may fluctuate&#13;
in response to changing interest rates, but they represent the highest degree of financial&#13;
security (and a corresponding low rate of return).&#13;
&#13;
321.    Suppose, then, for sake of argument, that treasuries offer a guaranteed return of&#13;
3.5% (i.e. ET=.035, ï?³T=0). In Figure M8.2 we draw the line of tangency to the curve&#13;
shown in Figure M8.1, which intersects at the portfolio V (65% A + 35%B). Then the line&#13;

connecting portfolio J (100% T-bills) represents combinations of t-bills and the efficient&#13;
portfolio V: for example, portfolio H represents a portfolio of 50% T-bills and 50% of&#13;
portfolio V (i.e. 50% T-bills,, 32.5%A, and 17,5% B). The efficient frontier is again shown&#13;
by the bold line, and runs from J to H to V to W.&#13;
&#13;
322.     We note that portfolio Y is no longer an efficient portfolio, because by adding&#13;
about 10% treasuries, for the same level of risk, expected returns increase: Portfolio P,&#13;
which contains 10% T-bills, has higher expected returns than portfolio Y for the same level&#13;
of risk.&#13;

323.     Auerbuch133 proposed that this model be used to capture the benefit of&#13;
renewable energy to a portfolio of (risky) fossil fuel generating assets. The analogy&#13;
requires that renewable energy be seen as the â&#128;&#156;risklessâ&#128;? asset (akin to US Treasuries),&#13;
while the risk associated with the fossil generating assets derives from fossil fuel&#13;
volatility. Under this presumption, Auerbuch shows that for the United States, adding&#13;
between 3-6% renewables to a portfolio of gas and coal generation will serve to reduce&#13;
cost or risk or both. In a subsequent analysis Auerbuch applies the model to the EU,&#13;
where he argues that an efficient generating portfolio would include as much as 12%&#13;
wind energy134.&#13;
&#13;
324.    However, the validity of the analogy depends critically on the notion of&#13;
renewables (and wind energy in particular) as having constant cost â&#128;&#147; i.e. once built, the&#13;
costs are fixed (since there is no fuel variability as with fossil fuels that causes fossil&#13;
generation costs to vary from month to month).135 Auerbuch acknowledges that&#13;

        Portfolio theory is based on a series of assumptions regarding efficient markets, including&#13;
        easily tradable assets at low transaction costs, perfect information about assets and&#13;
        normally distributed probability returns of investments in assets.            While these&#13;
        assumptions can be deemed to be a sufficient approximation of reality in highly liquid,&#13;
        large, developed financial markets, it is hard to argue that this would be the case for the&#13;
        generating portfolios of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s client countries. Moreover, optimal financial portfolio&#13;
        selections require infinite divisibility of assets, again unlikely in the case of small, or&#13;
        isolated, systems. Nevertheless, one could argue that because of the modular nature of&#13;

renewables are not entirely free of risk, but presumes that this can be diversified away&#13;

325.    This Note describes the scenario discovery process used in the study of hydro&#13;
planning in Nepal and the Upper Arun Hydro project (UAHP, summarized in Technical&#13;
Note C4).138 This process is an integral part of the Robust Decision Making&#13;
methodology: it uses statistical cluster-finding algorithms to provide concise&#13;
descriptions of the combination of future conditions that lead a strategy to fail to meet its&#13;
objectives.      This technique has also been used in the ESMAP Study of energy-security&#13;
             139&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
tradeoffs.&#13;
           140&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
326.    The description of these conditions helps focus decision makersâ&#128;&#153; attentio n on the&#13;
most important uncertain future conditions to the problem at stake. They can be thought&#13;
of as decision relevant scenarios141, because they help decision makers discuss the&#13;
acceptability of the risks involved with the various options available.&#13;
&#13;
327.     Scenario discovery begins with the creation of the database which contains the&#13;
modelâ&#128;&#153;s results. Each row of results reports a future (or case), which is a combination of&#13;
particular levels of each of the uncertainties considered (i.e., a certain price of electricity,&#13;
capital cost increase, precipitation and temperature changes, discount rates, plant load&#13;
factor, and lifetime of the plant) and the resulting performance of the project according&#13;
to the chosen metrics, in our case the NPV. This database creation is akin to the Monte&#13;
Carlo simulation procedure, which creates several thousand simulations of a projectâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
performance, but with the important distinction that Monte Carlo simulation makes&#13;
prior assumptions about probability distributions (from which the values are sampled),&#13;
whereas the RDM process doe not â&#128;&#147; it looks at all futures and requires only a definition&#13;
of the plausible ranges of uncertainty. For example, in the case of future oil prices, a&#13;
Monte Carlo simulation might hypothesize an expected value of future price of&#13;
$100/bbl, with some specified variance and skewness. In RDM one would examine all&#13;
futures in the range of $30/bbl to $200/bbl.&#13;
&#13;
328.     Scenario discovery works well when stakeholders agree on a threshold for the&#13;
performance metric. This allows the analyst to proceed with differentiating the futures&#13;
in which the project meets its objectives from the ones in which it does not. In this&#13;
analysis, it was agreed that the project(s) failed to meet its (their) objective in those&#13;
futures where NPV was negative (i.e., threshold = 0). The study used the 500 futures for&#13;
five of the six parameters and a full factorial design for including the stream flows (i.e,&#13;
the climate dimension).&#13;
&#13;
329.    The UAHP study then used the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) to&#13;
                                                                                             142&#13;

uncertainties. For instance, a set may indicate that the NPV is negative if the discount&#13;
rate is higher than a certain level and the stream flows decrease by a certain percentage.&#13;
PRIM helps identify the main uncertainties that may affect the projectâ&#128;&#153;s performance and&#13;
focus the attention on these relevant parameters.&#13;
&#13;
330. PRIM uses three measures to evaluate the different sets of conditions it identifies :&#13;
 ï&#130;· Coverage: the fraction of vulnerable futures out of all futures captured by the&#13;
    scenario. Ideally, we would want a coverage of 100% - but this is rarely obtainable.&#13;
 ï&#130;· Density: the fraction of all the vulnerable futures captured by the scenario, out of all&#13;
    futures captured. Again, ideally all futures captured should be vulnerable and&#13;
    density should be 100%.&#13;
 ï&#130;· Interpretability: the ease with which users can understand the information&#13;
    conveyed by the scenario. The number of uncertain conditions used to define the&#13;
    scenario serves as a proxy for interpretability. The smaller the number of conditions,&#13;
    the higher the interpretability.&#13;
&#13;
331.    PRIM generates a set of scenarios and presents tradeoff curves that help the&#13;
users choose the one scenario with the best combination of density, coverage, and&#13;
interpretability.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Note: Filled red circles=failure; open circle=success&#13;
&#13;
332.     Figure M9.1 illustrates an example of scenario discovery analysis for the 335&#13;
MW design of the Upper Arun hydro project (UAHP). It represents all 6,500 futures as&#13;
red circles; the filled red circles represent the futures in which the project has a negative&#13;
NPV (and thus fails to comply with the decision-makerâ&#128;&#153;s objective). The black box is the&#13;
best scenario describing the futures in which the project has a negative NPV: electricity&#13;
price increase of less than 70% than the initial price and capital costs more than 100%&#13;
higher than the initial costs. This figure shows only the constraints on capital cost&#13;
increase and electricity price that define each scenario, because they are the two most&#13;
important variables for defining scenarios, i.e. they are the parameters that matter most&#13;
for the sign of the NPV.&#13;
&#13;
333.     However, they do not fully explain all future conditions under which the project&#13;
may fail to meet the decision makersâ&#128;&#153; objectives. In other words, in the highlighted box&#13;
of Figure M9.1, which represents the values of the two variables most likely to cause the&#13;
project to fail (solid red dots), there also occur some futures in which the project will&#13;

&amp;#12;                             M9 SCENARIO DISCOVERY&#13;
&#13;
succeed. Similarly, in the area outside the box, which is dominated by open circles&#13;
representing success, there are some (though not many) futures in which the project will&#13;
fail. Note that the other parameters still play a small role in explaining the future&#13;
conditions under which the project may fail. And given that this scenario does not have&#13;
a coverage and density of 100 %, other scenarios are needed to more fully define&#13;
vulnerable futures.     However, the decision-maker can now be presented with&#13;
information about the conditions under which the project may be vulnerable, which can&#13;
improve the confidence with which a project decision can be made.&#13;
&#13;
334.    In some cases where coverage and density are low, no single scenario can&#13;
provide adequate coverage and density. In such cases, as is the case for the AUHPâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
analysis, the PRIM algorithm allows the user to iterate this process on the database. The&#13;
user identifies a scenario and the algorithm removes the cases within that scenario from&#13;
the database. The user then reruns PRIM and identifies another scenario from the&#13;
remaining data. This process can be repeated as many times as needed. The resulting set&#13;
of multiple scenarios may reduce interpretability, but can increase coverage and density.&#13;
&#13;
335.    A more complete description of RDM and scenario discovery can be found in&#13;

A3         GLOSSARY&#13;
&#13;
Avoided cost       A tariff based on the costs that the buyer avoids when an additional kWh of&#13;
tariff (ACT)       renewable energy is purchased from the renewable energy producer. In&#13;
                   theory, the buyer would reduce the dispatch of the most expensive thermal&#13;
                   unit in operation, and therefore the avoided cost would be based on the&#13;
                   variable operating cost â&#128;&#147; mainly fuel â&#128;&#147; of that highest cost (or â&#128;&#156;marginalâ&#128;?)&#13;
                   plant. In addition, the buyer avoids capacity costs, particularly when there is a&#13;
                   portfolio of renewable energy projects, whose capacity value is non-zero even if&#13;
                   the capacity value of individual projects is zero.&#13;
Basis Point        A term used in banking and finance to describe small variations in interest&#13;
(bp)               rates: 100 basis points = 1%. For example, 40 basis points=0.4%&#13;
Border price       The value of a traded good at a countryâ&#128;&#153;s border, namely free on board (fob) for&#13;
                   exports; or cost, insurance, freight (cif) for imports.&#13;
Capesize           Dry bulk carrier with capacity of 100,000 dwt or more. The typical Capesize&#13;
                   vessel used in coal trade has a capacity of 140,000 dwt.&#13;
Certified          A Kyoto Protocol unit equal to 1 tonne of CO2 equivalent. CERs are issued for&#13;
Emission           emission reductions from CDM projects.&#13;
Reductions&#13;
Elasticity of      The percentage change in individualsâ&#128;&#153; marginal utility corresponding to each&#13;
marginal utility   percentage change in consumption.&#13;
of consumption&#13;
Emission           The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme is based on an EU wide&#13;
reduction units    emissions cap (and allocated across countries by the EU): it trades in&#13;
(ERUs)             allowances called Emission Reduction Units (ERUs).&#13;
Feed-in tariff     A fixed tariff for renewable energy (named after the German Law&#13;
                   (Einspeisungsgesetz) that first introduced such tariffs for renewable energy in the&#13;
                   early 1990s). Most often determined by the estimated production cost of a&#13;
                   technology including some â&#128;&#156;fairâ&#128;? rate of return on equity and assumptions&#13;
                   about the financial structure of projects.&#13;
HHV                The higher heating value: (also known as gross calorific value) of a fuel is&#13;
                   defined as the amount of heat released by a specified quantity (initially at 25Â°C)&#13;
                   once it is combusted and the products have returned to a temperature of 25Â°C.&#13;
                   HHV includes the latent heat of vaporization of water in the combustion&#13;
                   products. It is mainly used in the US. See also LHV.&#13;
ISO conditions     Nameplate capacity of a thermal generating project under the conditions&#13;
                   defined by the International Standards Organization (namely at sea level and&#13;
                   15oC).&#13;
Japan Crude        The average monthly cif price of all crude oil imported into Japan. Used as a&#13;
Cocktail (JCC)     basis for LNG contracts in the Asia-Pacific market.&#13;
LHV                The lower heating value (also known as net calorific value) of a fuel is defined&#13;
                   as the amount of heat released by combusting a specified quantity (initially at&#13;
                   25Â°C) and returning the temperature of the combustion products to 150Â°C. This&#13;
                   assumes that the latent heat of vaporization of water in the reaction products is&#13;
                   not recovered (in contrast to HHV). The LHV is generally used in Europe. The&#13;
                   difference between LHV and HHV is greatest for natural gas (LHV = 47.1&#13;
                   MJ/kg, HHV 52.2 MJ/kg, about 10% higher), smallest for solid fuels (e.g. for a&#13;
                   typical coal, LHV=22.7 MJ/kg, HHV=23.9, about 5% higher)&#13;
LIBOR              The London Inter-bank Offer Rate is the interest rate that the London banks&#13;
                   charge each other. Different rates apply to different currencies and terms&#13;
                   (overnight, 30 day, six month, etc.) The rates are published daily by the British&#13;
                   Banking Association (www.bba.org.uk) based on a survey of a panel of banks.&#13;
                   LIBOR rates are widely used as the reference for variable interest commercial&#13;
                   loans (e.g. â&#128;&#156;six month LIBOR+2%â&#128;?).&#13;

&#13;
Mandated          Sometimes termed â&#128;&#156;renewable portfolio standardâ&#128;?. A requirement (or&#13;
market share      mandate) that distribution companies must purchase some percentage share of&#13;
(MMS)             their total energy purchases from renewable energy sources (in some countries,&#13;
                  this obligation is imposed on the generating companies).&#13;
Opportunity       The benefit lost from not using a good or resource in its best alternative use.&#13;
cost              Opportunity costs measured at economic prices should be used in economic&#13;
                  analysis as the measure of benefits.&#13;
Panamax           Dry bulk carrier with typical capacity of 60,000-99,999 dwt (The maximum size&#13;
                  that can pass through the Panama canal).&#13;
QECON             The economically optimal quantity of renewable energy (namely that quantity&#13;
                  of renewable energy whose production costs are below the avoided cost of the&#13;
                  system when fossil fuels are priced at their economic costs (either based on&#13;
                  border prices, or on production cost plus depletion premium).&#13;
QFIN              The quantity of renewable energy enabled at the avoided financial cost of&#13;
                  thermal generation (as under Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s present avoided cost tariff) .&#13;
QG.ENV            The economically optimal quantity of renewable energy including the avoided&#13;
                  global environmental damage costs of greenhouse gas emissions.&#13;
QSOC=QENV         The socially optimal quantity of renewable energy including consideration of&#13;
                  the avoided local environmental damage costs of fossil-fuel generation (from&#13;
                  air emissions such as SOx, NOx and particulates), and fossil fuels priced at&#13;
                  their economic cost.&#13;
Ramsey            According to the noted British economist Frank Ramsey, the social rate of time&#13;
Formula           preference (SRTP) is the sum of two terms: first is a utility discount rate&#13;
                  reflecting the pure time preference (ï?²), and the second is the product of the&#13;
                  elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption ï&#128;¨ï&#128; ï?±ï&#128; ï&#128;© and the annual growth&#13;
                  rate of the growth of per capita real consumption (g): thus SRTP=ï&#128; ï?²ï&#128;«ï&#128; ï?±g.&#13;
Social rate of    The rate at which society is willing to postpone a unit of current consumption&#13;
time preference   in exchange for more future consumption.. The use of the SRTP as the social&#13;
SRTP              discount rate is based on the argument that public projects displace current&#13;
                  consumption, and streams of costs and benefits to be discounted are essentially&#13;
                  streams of consumption goods either postponed or gained. There are two&#13;
                  general methods in use for its empirical estimation (1) the after tax return on&#13;
                  government bonds (or other low risk marketable securities), and (2) use of the&#13;
                  Ramsey Formula.&#13;
Pure rate of      Considered to consist of two components: individualsâ&#128;&#153; impatience or myopia&#13;
time preference   (though this component is ignored in many studies because of the difficulty of&#13;
ï&#128; ï&#128;¨ï?²ï&#128;©              measuring it); and the risk of death (or as argued by Nicholas Stern, the risk of&#13;
                  the extinction of the human race).&#13;
Shadow            The inverse of the SCF. The SER is often greater than the official exchange rate,&#13;
exchange rate     indicating domestic consumers place a higher value on foreign exchange than&#13;
(factor)          is given by the official exchange rate.&#13;
Standard          The ratio of the economic price of goods in an economy (at their border price&#13;
conversion        equivalents) to their domestic market price. It represents the extent to which&#13;
factor (SCF)      economic prices, in general, are lower than the domestic market values.&#13;
Switching value   In a sensitivity analysis, the value of an input data assumption that brings the&#13;
                  ERR to the hurdle rate (NPV to zero)&#13;
Value of          Willingness to pay for a given reduction in mortality risk. USEPA uses&#13;
statistical       $7.4million (2006$) as the default value for valuing mortality risk changes. In&#13;
life(VSL)         the     US     this   is   based   largely    on    wage-risk     studies   (see&#13;
