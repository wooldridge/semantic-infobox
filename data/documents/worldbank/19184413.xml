and Beyond&#13;
&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systemsâ&#128;&#148;in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the&#13;
African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations&#13;
Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

Strategic Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The situation within the water supply and sanitation            According to the calculations presented in this report,&#13;
(WSS) sector in Mauritania is somewhat contradictory: in        US$48 million per year will be required overall to achieve the&#13;
spite of the weakness of the institutions in charge of the      MDG targets. There needs to be an equitable allocation of&#13;
sector and the lack of financing for sanitation and, more       these funds between both the water supply and sanitation&#13;
recently, for the rural water supply (RWS) subsector,           subsectors, with rural areas receiving 60 percent of this&#13;
significant improvements have been made in the access           financing, compared to 40 percent for urban areas.&#13;
rates since 1990.&#13;
                                                                However, given the current preference for water supply&#13;
The institutional reform of the RWS subsector, notably          networks and sewer systems in urban areas, it is highly&#13;
marked by the implementation of a delegated management          likely that the actual figure required will be higher than this&#13;
system for water supply networks, has led to improvements       estimateâ&#128;&#148;and extremely difficult to mobilize. Following&#13;
in both service quality and accessâ&#128;&#148;at a pace which remains      the suspension of some donor financing as a result of the&#13;
only slightly below that required to meet the Millennium        crisis in 2008, it is expected that development partners will&#13;
Development Goal (MDG) targets.                                 increase their commitments over the next few years.&#13;
&#13;
In urban areas (40 percent of the population), access rates     In rural areas, the institutional framework remains poor and&#13;
have increased more slowly. However, due to its more            unstable. The management of water supply networks still&#13;
favorable baseline situation, the target for the urban water    needs to be improved; the sanitation subsector lacks both&#13;
supply subsector remains attainable, provided that all the      a clear intervention strategy and resources. These are the&#13;
financing required for the project to rehabilitate and extend   priority areas that need to be worked on to stimulate the&#13;
the network in Nouakchott can be obtained promptly.             capacity to mobilize and absorb financing, both domestic&#13;
                                                                and donor.&#13;
Sanitation, which has only recently appeared on Mauritaniaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
institutional landscape, is more problematic, especially in     This second AMCOW Country Status Overview (CSO2) has&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are:&#13;
&#13;
  Sectorwide&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Develop, then implement, a clear strategy and multiyear investment plan for achieving the Millennium Development&#13;
     Goal (MDG) targets in all subsectors.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Continue to integrate all sector institutions under the overall supervision of the Ministry of Water and Sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Allocate those resources vital to the smooth running of their activities to the central and deconcentrated departments&#13;
     and offices, recruit and train staff in planning, monitoring and evaluation, and regulatory tasks.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Continue to encourage commune involvement in local planning and in undertaking a contracting (or co-contracting)&#13;
     authority role for infrastructure, notably through training, the provision of process tools, and back-up support.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Establish regular monitoring of financing obtained per subsector.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Increase financing for the sanitation and rural water supply subsectors.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Define access to water supply and sanitation standards according to context, establish criteria for identifying facilities&#13;
     as improved, define the urban and rural service areas, and put monitoring indicators in place.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Conduct a national inventory of existing water supply and sanitation facilities to establish a baseline and populate the&#13;
     database of the Directorate of Planning, Monitoring and Cooperation (DPSC).&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Align the procedures used to monitor facilities built and financing utilized and introduce centralized data collection at&#13;
     the DPSC level.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Create a platform for institutional dialogue between the government and its development partners and an annual joint&#13;
       sector review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Conduct a national inventory of facilities, carry out a review of delegated management, and improve and expand the&#13;
       use of the standardized system for frequent monitoring of private operators under management contract across the&#13;
       whole country, with the regular transfer and processing of technical and financial data to central level.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Improve regulation by allocating the financial, material, and human resources required to the Multi-Sector&#13;
     Regulatory Agency for conducting monitoring tasks on water supply networks and to the National Office for Water&#13;
     Services in Rural Areas (ONSER) for controlling design and construction quality and for providing back-up support to&#13;
     operators.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Improve the clustering of the networks and delegated service areas so as to harmonize the tariff at which water is&#13;
     sold, improve the operatorsâ&#128;&#153; technical and financial performance, and ensure sustainability of the infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Set up a national training program for delegates on technical and financial management, ensuring that ONSER is&#13;
     particularly involved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                         3&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Urban water supply&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Develop an overall strategy for the subsector and a 2015 investment plan to improve both the mobilization of finance&#13;
         and medium-term vision, and prioritize disadvantaged neighborhoods.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Develop a consultation platform between the Directorate of Water, the national water company, SNDE, and the&#13;
       directorates in charge of urban development, land use planning, sanitation, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Develop the use of surface water storage to supplement the groundwater resources which are both nonrenewable&#13;
       and insufficient in secondary centers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
    Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Conduct a national review of access to sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Put in place a consultation platform for the different stakeholders in order to align approaches, and a project&#13;
       reporting system to monitor progress and draw lessons from implementation.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Implement the national sanitation policy and strategy through a large-scale proactive sanitation promotion program,&#13;
         with the support of development partners.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	   Ensure the human and financial resources needed to implement such a program are made available to the Directorate&#13;
         of Sanitation, the deconcentrated departments, and the communes.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
1.	Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 AMCOW delegated this&#13;
task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are implementing it&#13;
in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been produced in&#13;
collaboration with the Government of Mauritania and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

  Year	Event&#13;
  1975	 Following the drought in 1973, the Directorate of Water undertakes a proactive policy to set up water points in&#13;
  	     rural and semi-rural areas.&#13;
  1991	 The Water Supply Master Plan and the 1991â&#128;&#147;2000 Investment Plan prioritizes the construction of small piped water&#13;
  	     supply systems in rural and semi-rural areas, in line with the rural and semi-urban water supply policy adopted the&#13;
  	     previous year.&#13;
  1993â&#128;&#147;	Establishment of a delegated management system for small piped water supply systems in rural and&#13;
  1994	 semi-urban areas.&#13;
  2001	 The adopted Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) establishes water supply as a priority sector.&#13;
  	       The state withdraws from operational functions in the water supply sector and creates a number of specialized&#13;
  	       institutions (CNRE, ANEPA, APAUS). The incumbent water supply and electricity operator in urban areas (SONELEC)&#13;
  	       is divided up into two companies and the national water company, SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale dâ&#128;&#153;Eau (SNDE), is created with&#13;
  	       a view to privatization. The mandate of the Multi-Sector Regulatory Authority is extended to include water supply.&#13;
  2005	 Establishment of a Sector Technical Committee and review of the Water Law (dating from 1987).&#13;
  2006	 Review of the PRSP: adoption of a sectorwide approach aimed at achieving the MDG targets.&#13;
  	       Review and adoption of the Sector Policy Declaration for the Water Supply Sector (that includes sanitation).&#13;
  	       Creation of a Directorate of Sanitation within the ministry in charge of water.&#13;
  2007	 Creation of a central Directorate responsible for planning, coordination, monitoring, and cooperation within the&#13;
  	     ministry in charge of water and sanitation.&#13;
  	       Implementation of regulations for the water supply sector with the adoption of several implementing provisions,&#13;
  	       the signature of specifications for the National Agency for Water Supply and Sanitation (ANEPA: Agence Nationale&#13;
  	       de lâ&#128;&#153;Eau potable et de lâ&#128;&#153;Assainissement) and the delegation to private operators of management of the new water&#13;
  	       supply networks constructed in rural and semi-urban areas.&#13;
  2008	 The technical ministry is separated from energy for the first time and is solely dedicated to water supply&#13;
  	     and sanitation.&#13;
  	       Review of the Local Authoritiesâ&#128;&#153; Law is not able to be completed due to political unrest.&#13;
  2009	 Creation of the National Office for Sanitation (ONAS: Office National de lâ&#128;&#153;Assainissement).&#13;
  2010	 ANEPA becomes the National Office for Water Services in Rural Areas (ONSER: Office National des Services dâ&#128;&#153;Eau en&#13;

strategic directions were confirmed in 2005â&#128;&#147;06 when the&#13;
Water Law, the Sector Policy Declaration, and the PRSP&#13;

as illustrated by the fact that the 10-year investment&#13;
plans have been updated up to 2015. However, these&#13;
investment plans are neither monitored nor reviewed on&#13;
a regular basis.                                                                            RSH&#13;

on UWS over the last few years represents a change of&#13;
direction from that of the 1990s, when the majority of&#13;

 In contrast to rural areas, access to improved                                 rural exodus that has seen sanitation become an ever&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Mauritania :
            turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The situation within the water supply
            and sanitation (WSS) sector in Mauritania is somewhat
            contradictory: in spite of the weakness of the institutions
            in charge of the sector and the lack of financing for
            sanitation and, more recently, for the rural water supply
            (RWS) subsector, significant improvements have been made in
            the access rates since 1990. The institutional reform of the
            RWS subsector, notably marked by the implementation of a
            delegated management system for water supply networks, has
            led to improvements in both service quality and access, at a
            pace which remains only slightly below that required to meet
            the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets. In rural
            areas, the institutional framework remains poor and
            unstable. The management of water supply networks still
            needs to be improved; the sanitation subsector lacks both a
            clear intervention strategy and resources. These are the
            priority areas that need to be worked on to stimulate the
            capacity to mobilize and absorb financing, both domestic and
            donor. This second AMCOW Country Status Overview (CSO2) has
            been produced in collaboration with the Government of
            Mauritania and other stakeholders.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
