CHIAPTER I&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    Cambodia has recently emerged from two decades of civil conflict, social upheaval&#13;
and a command economy. Today, following a UN brokered peace agreement in 1991 and&#13;
subsequent elections in May 1993, a coalition government is in power which has embarked&#13;
on a rehabilitation and reconstruction program aimed at putting the country back on the&#13;
path of economic and social development.&#13;
1.2   The Royal Government has made it a high priority to direct donor assistance to&#13;
rural areas that have long been neglected or insecure. Much of the country's&#13;
infrastructure is in a state of disrepair or totally destroyed, with many areas lacking&#13;
adequate schools, clinics, water supply and local roads. The opportunity to address these&#13;
needs coincides, unfortunately, with a lack of experience and capacity in the central&#13;
ministries to organize and deliver such investments on a national scale. Developing such&#13;
capacity will take time, and in the meantime, under the current situation, the rural poor&#13;
must depend on their own meager resources and the limited budgets of provincial&#13;
governments to rebuild infrastructure and restore basic services.&#13;
1.3   Several features of present day Cambodia, however, encourage a more positive&#13;
outlook for investing in poor, neglected areas of the country. Circumstances have forced&#13;
communities and local governments to operate autonomously of the central government&#13;
for many years, and communities, working with small contractors, have managed to&#13;
undertake some local projects, especially if foreign financial assistance was available. The&#13;
local contracting and building industry is, therefore, represented throughout much of the&#13;
country and a relatively large number of NGOs are operating on a local level and have&#13;
developed considerable expertise in service provision and community development.&#13;
Overall, therefore, there is widespread local capacity to undertake small, relatively simple&#13;
construction projects. However, financing remains a major constraint to carrying out such&#13;
projects in any large numbers.&#13;
1.4   In response to this situation, in March 1994, the Government expressed its interest&#13;
in creating a social fund. A social fund is a demand-driven financing mechanism that aims&#13;
to target an increased level of investment to poor areas where basic infrastructure and&#13;
services are badly damaged or destroyed. Patterned after the successful experience of&#13;
social funds in Latin America and Africa, the Social Fund of the Kingdom of Cambodia&#13;
(SFKC) would finance, on a grant basis, small-scale projects to support the rehabilitation&#13;
of social and economic infrastructure and social services. The proposed project would&#13;
support the establishment and operations of SFKC through an IDA credit of $20 million;&#13;
$16.8 million to finance seed capital for project financing, $1.7 million for budget support&#13;
for the SFKC's start-up and operations, $0.5 million for technical assistance and training&#13;
of SFKC staff in project management activities, and $1 million unallocated. Based on the&#13;
experience of other social funds, if SFKC is successful in its operations, it is expected that&#13;
the demand for its services will quickly exceed this budget, and it will be able to attract&#13;
additional financing for a program totaling at least $40 million. The institutional capacity&#13;
of SFKC will be developed under the project to manage this expansion of the operational&#13;
budget and sub-project activity.&#13;

CHAPTER H&#13;
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONTEXT&#13;
A.   Economic Context&#13;
2.1   In September 1993, following UN administered elections, Cambodia established itself as a&#13;
fledgling democracy under a new constitution, with the constitutional monarch as head of state.&#13;
The ultimate objective of the new Government is to rebuild the country and to realize its full&#13;
economic potential while reducing poverty, which is pervasive throughout the country. With an&#13;
estimated per capita GDP of US$200, Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the world.&#13;
Most of the poor are concentrated in the rural areas, where over 80 percent of the population&#13;
lives, though the exact number and location of people living below the poverty line are yet to be&#13;
determined.&#13;
2.2   On the macroeconomic front, the Government's immediate task on coming to power was&#13;
to control the high rate of inflation and deteriorating fiscal situation. In late 1992, a series of&#13;
stabilization measures were taken, in consultation with the World Bank and the 1IMF, which&#13;
effectively arrested the economic decline. Inflation was brought under control, the exchange rate&#13;
stabilized and economic growth was relatively strong -- official data show real GDP growth of&#13;
4.1% in 1993 and 4.0% in 1994. However, despite this good performance, the country's&#13;
economic situation remains precarious. The Government depends heavily on donors for budget&#13;
support, as internal revenue mobilization is extremely low. Furthermore, growth has been&#13;
unevenly distributed across the economy and the country, coming largely from the urban-based&#13;
construction and service sectors, not from agriculture and the rural economy on which over 80%&#13;
of the population depend.&#13;
2.3   The Government's long term objective is to achieve sustainable and equitable growth. Its&#13;
immediate objectives under the 1995-97 macroeconomic framework agreed with the LMF and the&#13;
Bank are to reach a 7.5% GDP growth rate by 1997, to consolidate recent stablization efforts and&#13;
to reduce the rate of inflation to 10% in 1995 and 5% in 1997. Maintaining macroeconomic&#13;
stability will require continued fiscal and monetary restraint and taking tough measures to raise&#13;
government revenue. These macroeconomic policies will be accompanied by continued efforts to&#13;
put in place the building blocks for a market economy, including establishing transparent and&#13;
accountable legal and judicial systems, implementing structural reforms in the financial sector,&#13;
civil service and public enterprises, and normalizing relations with the international financial&#13;
community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
2&#13;
B.    Social Context&#13;
2.4    Cambodia's recent political and economic history have taken an enormous toll on both the&#13;
people and the physical infrastructure of the country. During the period 1970-79, between 1.5&#13;
and 3.5 million people lost their lives and another half a million people became refugees. Virtually&#13;
all infrastructure was destroyed, as were many of the country's institutions.&#13;
2.5   Today, despite the notable progress made since the 1980s, the consequences of this&#13;
devastation are still apparent. The country suffers from a lack of educated people, making human&#13;
resources development and capacity building top priorities. An uncommonly high proportion of&#13;
the adult population are women -- 25% of households are estimated to be headed by women, and&#13;
these households are generally among the poorest. In addition, there are a large number of&#13;
orphans and people who have been physically disabled during the war; one out of every 236&#13;
people in Cambodia is an amputee, injured by landmines, the highest national proportion of&#13;
disabled people in the world.&#13;
2.6    Added to these problems, are those common to poor countries around the world.&#13;
Available (though incomplete) data suggest that life expectancy at birth in Cambodia is only 51&#13;
years, the infant mortality rate of 116 per thousand live births is more than three times the regional&#13;
average; mean years of schooling remain low; only 53 percent of the population have access to&#13;
health services; and access to safe water is extremely low, particularly in rural areas.&#13;
2.7    Education. Cambodia is in the process of rebuilding its formal education system, which&#13;
was effectively destroyed during the 1975-79 period. Since the 1980s, impressive progress has&#13;
been made in rehabilitating school buildings and enrolling children in primary and secondary&#13;
schools. A beginning has also been made in pre-school, technical and vocational education, as&#13;
well as in adult literacy programs.&#13;
2.8    However, much remains to be done. There is still a widespread shortage of competent&#13;
and adequately qualified teachers and severe budget constraints have caused a neglect of&#13;
educational infrastructure at all levels. Many facilities destroyed during the war have yet to be&#13;
rebuilt and those that exist are often very run-down. Recent building audits show that roughly&#13;
half of the existing 27,000 classrooms are in need of repair and/or reconstruction. Communities&#13;
are bearing the brunt of the cost of infrastructure provision and maintenance, which is often&#13;
beyond their means. Inadequate administrative and managerial capacity within the Ministry of&#13;
Education remains a key constraint to the effective implementation of policies and programs in the&#13;
sector.&#13;
2.9   Recently, major efforts have been made to improve policy development and program&#13;
planning to achieve the Government's overall objective of high quality education for all. The&#13;
Government has prepared a medium-term investment plan for basic education for the period&#13;
2&#13;
Further details of the social context of this project are provided in the social assessment carried out during project&#13;
preparation. See Maja Naur, 1994 Social and Institutional Aspects of a Social Fund Project in Cambodia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
1995-2000, with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other donors. The&#13;
main policy objectives of this program are (i) improve the quality of primary and lower secondary&#13;
school education through improvements in curriculum, textbook and instructional support&#13;
materials and teacher training; (ii) assure equitable access to six years of primary schooling,&#13;
linked to gradual expansion of lower secondary schooling, through school building rehabilitation&#13;
and targeting of schooling to ensure education for girls and minorities; and (iii) strengthen&#13;
govemment's planning and management capability, at central, provincial and district levels.&#13;
2.10   Health. As in the education sector, the Government faces major challenges in the health&#13;
sector. Malaria and tuberculosis are spreading almost unchecked in rural areas; child mortality&#13;
from preventable diseases is high for a country of Cambodia's level of development; and public&#13;
health services are unavailable or ineffective over large parts of the country.&#13;
2.11   Since mid- 1992, significant progress has been made in improving the situation. The flow&#13;
of donor assistance to the sector has accelerated sharply; the availability of pharmaceuticals in&#13;
private markets and public facilities has increased throughout the country; fiscal reforms have&#13;
paved the way for the first truly national health budget in many years; and a comprehensive&#13;
planning process has identified program objectives, needs and timetables.&#13;
2.12  However, a number of constraints to the implementation of an effective public health&#13;
policy and program remain, including (i) the low allocation of budgetary resources to the health&#13;
sector; (ii) donor agencies have largely bypassed central government in favor of direct assistance&#13;
to public health facilities at the local level, resulting in a lack of coordination within the sector;&#13;
(iii) the qualifications of practicing health professionals are extremely low, largely due to the years&#13;
of conflict; (iv) the physical infrastructure of the public health system has suffered from years of&#13;
neglect; (v) the public health system has been greatly decentralized in its management and&#13;
financing, with inadequate policy guidance from the central ministry; and (vi) low salaries and&#13;
various other factors have led public health personnel to request and receive private fees from&#13;
patients within public facilities. This latter practice leads to biases against the poor and to&#13;
inefficiencies in the utilization of public health services that should be provided free of charge.&#13;
2.13   The Ministry of Health has begun rebuilding a national health system through an intensive&#13;
process of health policy development and program planning assisted by WHO, UNICEF, UNDP&#13;
and the World Bank. The policy goals articulated by the Government are first, to reestablish&#13;
functioning primary health services; second, to strengthen the national programs aimed at the&#13;
principal communicable and preventable diseases; and third, to improve the capacity of the health&#13;
system to perform basic functions and to manage resources effectively.&#13;
2.14   Rural Roads. The rehabilitation of roads in Cambodia is a prerequisite for the&#13;
reconstruction of the country as a whole. Due to the dilapidated state of many primary and&#13;
secondary roads, large parts of the country are effectively isolated. In these areas, local markets&#13;
can only be accessed at very high costs or not at all, supply routes for essential commodities are&#13;
threatened and basic social services cannot be provided. Expanding the repair and rehabilitation&#13;
of rural roads is a high Government priority, as part of the overall effort to improve rural&#13;
infrastructure and reduce poverty. Particular emphasis will need to be placed on linking rural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
roads to the rehabilitated national roads in order to allow farmers to transport their surplus to&#13;
markets and to help integrate markets. To date, the main actors in rural road rehabilitation have&#13;
been UNDP's CARERE program and the ILO, both of which support labor-intensive road&#13;
rehabilitation programs.&#13;
2.15 Water Supply and Sanitation. Water supply services were brought to a complete stop&#13;
during the 1975-79 period. Though NGOs have been involved in the rehabilitation of water&#13;
supply and sanitation systems since the mid-I 980s, the level of services remains extremely low,&#13;
with about 20 percent of the urban population and 12 percent of the rural population having&#13;
access to a safe and reliable source of water. UNICEF has been the main agency supporting the&#13;
development of water points in rural areas and of policies for maintenance. Expansion of rural&#13;
water supply projects, which are currently constrained by financial difficulties and lack of skilled&#13;
workers, is called for with attention being paid as to how to involve local populations more&#13;
actively in construction and maintenance.&#13;
C.    Institutional Setting&#13;
2.16  Given the years of war and recent establishment of the Government, management capacity&#13;
within the government, at both central and provincial levels, is still weak. Lack of budgetary&#13;
resources compounds the problem as many key ministries lack the minimum staff and basic&#13;
equipment and supplies necessary to carry out their duties. Central ministries are responsible for&#13;
establishing overall policies and directing Government programs, but provincial administrations&#13;
have a high degree of autonomy and often act independently of central government. This lack of&#13;
communication has led to inadequate coordination between central and local levels and lack of&#13;
supervision at the local level.&#13;
2.17   Donors, UN agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have played an&#13;
important role in Cambodia since the 1980s, particularly in the health, education and rural&#13;
development sectors. In many instances, they have taken defacto responsibility for local level&#13;
service delivery and community development activities directly, with little or no coordination with&#13;
the central Government. However, as the Government has gained strength and capacity to&#13;
manage programs, communication and coordination between the Government and NGOs has&#13;
improved.&#13;
2.18  There is a substantial NGO presence in Cambodia, comprising about 90 international and&#13;
40 local NGOs. The majority rely on financing from bilateral and multilateral donors, including&#13;
USAID, the European Union and the French Government. Many of the international NGOs have&#13;
moved their activities to Cambodia in the last 2-3 years, having worked in the refugee camps&#13;
previously, whereas the majority of the local NGOs started their activities in the last two years.&#13;
Though the overall implementation capacity of NGOs varies greatly, in general, their wide-&#13;
ranging experience and expertise in community programs and service delivery and increasing&#13;
willingness to coordinate activities with the Government will make them valuable partners for&#13;
SFKC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

CHAPTER III&#13;
GOVERNMENT STRATEGY AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
A.    Government's Social Development Strategy&#13;
3.1   The overarching objective of the Royal Government is to achieve sustainable growth with&#13;
equity and social justice. As laid out in the 1994 "National Programme to Rehabilitate and&#13;
Develop Cambodia", this translates into a commitment to (a) reform the State, its institutions and&#13;
its public service so as to achieve political and socio-economic priorities; (b) rely on private&#13;
entrepreneurship and the market as engines of growth; (c) double the present level of GDP by&#13;
2004 in real terms; (d) extend health, educational and social services to the entire population; (e)&#13;
improve rural living standards by promoting rural development as a central development priority;&#13;
(f) ensure that the pattern of development is sustainable socially, politically, fiscally and&#13;
environmentally; and (g) strengthen domestic self-reliance so as to reduce dependence on external&#13;
assistance.&#13;
3.2   A central element of the Government's strategy is to provide direct support for sustained&#13;
development through public investment programs in infrastructure rehabilitation, health, education&#13;
and rural development. Rehabilitating and reconstructing physical infrastructure is seen as critical&#13;
to reducing bottlenecks to development, as is widening access to social services, especially among&#13;
women and disadvantaged groups. The Government plans to pay particular attention to&#13;
developing the country's rural areas, where the majority of the poor live, and to ensuring that the&#13;
more remote areas of the country gradually become integrated into society's mainstream.&#13;
3.3   The greatest hurdle the Government faces in achieving these objectives, aside from a lack&#13;
of financial resources, is the limited capacity of key line ministries to design and implement&#13;
appropriate programs and projects. Thus, a central element of the Government's strategy is to&#13;
strengthen the capacity of line ministries to improve service delivery and increase their absorptive&#13;
capacity. The Ministries of Education, Health and Agriculture have been targeted as priorities in&#13;
terms of capacity building. However, developing such capacity will take time. Given the urgent&#13;
need to increase public investment, the Government has proposed the establishment of a social&#13;
fund, as a mechanism to provide rapid and effective financing to small sub-projects proposed by&#13;
governmental and non-governmental entities.&#13;
B.    Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
3.4   For social, political and economic reasons it is imperative to increase public investment&#13;
and employment opportunities in the poor areas of Cambodia quickly. A social fund provides a&#13;
financing mechanism that is well-suited to such a task and to current conditions and capacities in&#13;
Cambodia. It is flexible, demand-driven and can respond rapidly to local needs. As such, it&#13;
would be a productive interim measure to put Government resources to work for the benefit of&#13;
the poor and enable the Government to deliver tangible project assistance to under-served rural&#13;
and urban areas at this crucial early stage of its tenure in power.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
3.5   The project is a key element of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). In&#13;
particular, it supports one of the main objectives of the CAS which is to support critical&#13;
rehabiliation and reconstruction that will have a significant impact quickly. In line with the spirit&#13;
of the CAS, the Social Fund Project is an innovative project that takes advantage of available&#13;
opportunities and capacities to channel investment effectively to the poor. Thus, it aims to&#13;
increase household incomes while contributing to the rehabilitation of social services needed for&#13;
longer-term human resource development.&#13;
3.6   The interest and commitment of the Royal Government to the Social Fund project is high,&#13;
as clearly demonstrated by the speed with which the Government created SFKC and carried out&#13;
preparation and appraisal activities. Political support for the project is strong at all levels of&#13;
goverrunent, from the Prime Ministers, to line ministries to local government officials. Donors&#13;
and NGOs have also expressed strong support for the Social Fund Project.&#13;
3.7    Relationship with other Bank-financed Projects. The Bank is at an early stage of&#13;
involvement in Cambodia. To date, two IDA credits have been approved (the Emergency&#13;
Rehabilitation Project credit and the Technical Assistance Project credit), though further projects&#13;
are under preparation, including an Economic Recovery Credit, a power project, a health&#13;
development project and a rural development project. The relationship of the Social Fund with&#13;
other IDA-financed operations is expected to be complementary, not competitive. At the policy&#13;
level, the Social Fund's activities would be guided by the development of sector strategies&#13;
supported by other Bank-financed projects. At the operational level, SFKC projects will be&#13;
simple, low-cost investments managed and executed by local entities and contractors. As such&#13;
they will not involve the strong technical input typical of more complex and integrated Bank&#13;
projects nor will they overlap with them. Mechanisms to coordinate with the relevant line&#13;
ministries would be established, at both the central and local level, so as to ensure that SFKC-&#13;
financed projects fall within local development plans and to encourage coordination at the&#13;
operational level. If SFKC proves successful at establishing an efficient and cost-effective means&#13;
of providing small-scale public infrastructure, it could be used by other Bank-financed projects,&#13;
such as the health and agriculture projects, to carry out small-scale public works.&#13;
C.    Lessons from Social Fund Experience&#13;
3.8   The Bank has financed over 30 social fund type operations since 1987, mainly in Latin&#13;
America and Africa, accumulating considerable experience in the process. The design of the&#13;
proposed project incorporates the lessons from these operations. In particular, to ensure the&#13;
transfer of knowledge to the Cambodian Social Fund team, during project preparation the Bank&#13;
provided the Government with substantial technical assistance and advice from current and former&#13;
staff of the Bolivia and Ecuador social funds and from Bank staff involved in the design of other&#13;
social fund projects.&#13;
3.9    At a conceptual level, the most relevant lessons learned from prior experience are:&#13;
a) a social fund should be considered as only one element of a much broader poverty reduction&#13;
strategy; it should not been seen as a panacea for reducing poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
b) while the overall objective of the social fund needs to be clearly framed, experience shows that&#13;
social funds can serve a number of purposes simultaneously. These include contributing to&#13;
the decentralization of service delivery, building the capacity of grassroots organizations and&#13;
other implementing agencies and bringing NGOs into a more cooperative and coordinated&#13;
relationship with the Government. In the case of Cambodia, the social fund may help in the&#13;
democratization process, by providing local governments and communities with increased&#13;
control over local development decisions and project implementation. It will also help private&#13;
sector development by increasing the turnover and capacity of small and medium sized&#13;
enterprises, particularly those in the construction industry.&#13;
c) the lesson from experience as to whether social funds should be purely temporary, short-term&#13;
mechanisms is not yet conclusive. The Emergency Social Fund in Bolivia is the only fund&#13;
technically to close thus far, and this was succeeded by a Social Investment Fund that&#13;
effectively continued the operations of the Fund. In general, flexibility and regard for the&#13;
country context are called for in determining the fiuture direction of a social fund. The&#13;
Statutes of SFKC provide for optional renewal of the its' five year mandate by Royal Decree.&#13;
3.10. At an operational level, the main lessons which have influenced the design ofthe proposed&#13;
project are:&#13;
a) the importance of institutional auto7nomy and freedom from political interference for the&#13;
Social Fund.&#13;
b) the need for transparency and accountability. A comprehensive operational manual, effective&#13;
management information system, standardized reporting, contracting of independent&#13;
evaluations, and systematically gaining the feedback from sub-project beneficiaries are all&#13;
tools to help ensure transparency.&#13;
c) the need to attract high caliber, motivated staff by maintaining a non-bureaucratic&#13;
environment and paying competitive salaries.&#13;
d) mechanisms for sector coordination with line ministries should be flexible enough not to&#13;
compromise the independence and efficiency of the fund.&#13;
e) the need for close involvement of provincial and district governments in the project cycle to&#13;
improve overall coordination and project sustainability.&#13;
f) the importance of outreach activities, including promotional activities, facilitation and&#13;
training, to reach the poorest regions and targeted beneficiaries and to find qualified sub-&#13;
projects.  Outreach activities can also play a useful role in promoting transparency and&#13;
openness and generating public confidence in SFKC's integrity.&#13;
g) the importance of using some monitorable, albeit simple, targeting plan to reach the poor.&#13;
h) the need for community "ownership " of the sub-projects to ensure sustainability.&#13;
i) simplified procurement proceduires and rapid and timely payment of contractors are&#13;
necessary conditions for efficient and rapid sub-project implementation.&#13;
j) the need for strong supervision mechanisms at both managerial and sub-project levels.&#13;
&#13;

CHAPTER IV&#13;
THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Origins of the Project&#13;
4.1   The preparation of this project emerged out of discussions with the Royal Government in&#13;
March 1994 about the possibility of establishing a social fund. The Government expressed a&#13;
strong interest in the idea, regarding a social fund as a mechanism well-suited to fill the urgent&#13;
need for additional financing of infrastructure and employment generating activities in the poor&#13;
and underserved areas of the Kingdom. The Government was quick to follow-up this&#13;
commitment with action, and in July 1994 a preparation mission took place, after which the&#13;
Government established a Social Fund Project Preparation Unit (PPU) to carry out preparation&#13;
activities and appointed its Project Director. Pre-appraisal of the project was carried out in&#13;
October 1994 and by the end of December 1994, the Government had enacted Royal Decrees&#13;
creating the Social Fund of the Kingdom of Cambodia (SFKC) as an autonomous Government&#13;
institution and appointing the Board of Directors. The project was appraised and negotiated in&#13;
March 1995.&#13;
B.    Project Objectives&#13;
4.2   The objectives of the project are to support the Government's to reduce poverty through:&#13;
(a) financing small-scale projects for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of social and economic&#13;
infrastructure, and other socially productive activities; (b) creating short-term employment&#13;
opportunities; (c) expanding community opportunities to identify local development needs and&#13;
manage small-scale development projects; and (d) increasing line ministry experience and capacity&#13;
in developing investment criteria for local infrastructure construction.&#13;
C.   Institutional Framework of SFKC&#13;
4.3   The Social Fund of the Kingdom of Cambodia (SFKC) has been created by Royal Decree&#13;
as an autonomous public institution under the Office of the Prime Minister. Given its autonomous&#13;
status, the Royal Government agreed during negotiations that a separate Fund Agreement,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, would be entered into between the Government and SFKC. In particular, it&#13;
was agreed that, under this the Fund Agreement, the Government will make the proceeds of the&#13;
Credit available to SFKC on a non-reimbursable grant basis. As a condition of effectiveness, the&#13;
Fund Agreement shall have been signed and entered into effect between the Government and&#13;
SFKC (para. 8.3 (a)). The organization and management of SFKC are laid out in its Statutes (see&#13;
Annex A) which were approved by the Royal Government in December 1994. According to the&#13;
statutes, the co-Prime Ministers will act as the co-Presidents of SFKC. They will be responsible&#13;
for proposing the appointment of the members of the Board of Directors, comprising&#13;
representatives from the Government, judiciary, private sector and non-governmental&#13;
organizations, and have ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the objectives of SFKC are&#13;
implemented effectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
4.4   The Board of Directors is composed of eleven members including the General Director of&#13;
SFKC, whose appointments were decided by Royal Decree in December 1994 (Annex B). The&#13;
Board, which would meet every six months, is responsible for approving the policies, procedures&#13;
and budget of SFKC, approving and ratifying any agreements SFKC may enter into for financial&#13;
support from international financial organizations or bilateral donors, and for defining the scope&#13;
and content of reports to be submitted by the Executive Committee to the Board.&#13;
4.5   The Executive Committee, comprised of five members of the Board and the General&#13;
Director, shall represent the Board in carrying out the Board's policies and approving applications&#13;
for sub-project financing. It would meet at least every two weeks as the Chairman may decide.&#13;
The General Director will be responsible for managing and administering the day-to-day&#13;
operations of SFKC in accordance with its operational policies and procedures.&#13;
D.    Operational Procedures&#13;
4.6   SFKC will act as a financial intermediary. It will not be involved in project identification,&#13;
preparation and implementation of projects, but will accept and appraise applications for sub-&#13;
project financing from eligible applicants, which include community groups, local governments,&#13;
and local and international NGOs, and will supervise sub-project implementation. Applicant&#13;
eligibility is defined separately for each sub-project type depending on its nature. For example, a&#13;
local water user group would be the eligible applicant for a water supply project; for a schools&#13;
project, the school parents committee or school director could apply; and in the case of a rural&#13;
roads project, the district authority would be eligible to apply. Applicant eligibility is designed&#13;
such that those eligible are the lowest-level entity able to assume responsibility for the operation&#13;
and maintenance of the project. As such, the applicant would generally represent the intended&#13;
beneficiaries of the project. The project thereby institutes a process that would allow locally&#13;
representative entities to participate in decision-making about local investments and would&#13;
provide them with the responsibility to supervise implementation and then maintain and operate&#13;
the facilities. Individuals seeking financing for private or commnercial activities would not be&#13;
eligible to apply&#13;
4.7   Applications to SFKC may be sponsored by an entity other than the eligible applicant.&#13;
These "sponsors" would play the role of a facilitator, assisting applicants which lack the capacity&#13;
and resources to prepare or design the project, and assuming the responsibility for procuring the&#13;
works or equipment for project implementation. For example, a line ministry might sponsor an&#13;
application for a district hospital, or an NGO might sponsor an application for a communal water&#13;
project.&#13;
4.8   SFKC-financed projects would be implemented by an "implementing agency" (a&#13;
contractor in the case of civil works), which would be selected by the applicant or by the sponsor.&#13;
SFKC would be delegated the authority by the applicant or sponsor to disburse funds directly to&#13;
the "implementing agency", which would perform the works, provide the equipment or carry out&#13;
the services financed under the sub-project. In some cases, the applicant may also implement the&#13;
project, for example, in the case of an NGO applying for a training project which the NGO would&#13;
implement itself SFKC staff would appraise all sub-projects and directly supervise sub-project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
implementation. They would also promote, encourage and orient the demand for project&#13;
financing. Details of the project cycle are described in Chapter 5.&#13;
4.9    Line ministries would play a key role in the project. Their main function would be to&#13;
define sectoral policy guidelines and standards for infrastructure construction within which SFKC&#13;
would operate.&#13;
E.    Project Components&#13;
4.10    The project would consist of two components. Under the first component financing&#13;
would be provided for seed capital for SFKC to finance sub-projects primarily in the areas of&#13;
public infrastructure and services, as further described below. The second component would&#13;
consist of institutional support for SFKC's establishment and operations including (a) financing&#13;
of salaries, vehicles, equipment, and operating expenses; and (b) technical assistance and training&#13;
to improve SFKC's operational capacity and procedures.&#13;
4.11   First Component: Social Fund Seed Capital ($18.9 million). SFKC will provide grant&#13;
financing for small-scale projects, up to a maximum cost of $250,000 each. To be eligible for&#13;
financing, all projects would have to adhere to a set of eligibility principles. These include the&#13;
principle that all projects shall benefit the poor; projects should be labor intensive or otherwise&#13;
generate a significant social impact; SFKC will not finance recurrent costs; and all projects must be&#13;
consistent with national sectoral policies (see Annex C for complete list of eligibility principles).&#13;
4.12   If projects accord with the eligibility principles, their financing is subject to appraisal by&#13;
SFKC staff based on a set of eligibility and appraisal criteria developed for each sub-project type&#13;
and presented in the Operational Manual (see para. 5.12). The majority of sub-projects eligible&#13;
for financing are likely to fall within three main categories: social infrastructure, economic&#13;
infrastructure and social services.&#13;
4.13   Social infrast-ucture, which is defined as infrastructure related to social services, would&#13;
include the rehabilitation, construction and expansion of operating health and education facilities&#13;
(especially health clinics, primary and lower secondary schools, and training centers), social&#13;
welfare facilities (rehabilitation centers, orphanages) and communal sanitation systems.&#13;
4.14   Economic infrastructure, which would include the rehabilitation of communal water&#13;
supply systems, rural roads, and communal irrigation and drainage works.&#13;
4.15   Social services. Under this category, financing would be provided for selected fees,&#13;
equipment and materials for training programs in the areas of small enterprise development and&#13;
public health. To be eligible for SFKC financing, such programs must be directed to local&#13;
communities and run by reliable NGOs. Such sub-projects might include practical training in&#13;
small business management, agricultural skills for small farmers, information and education&#13;
training for public health and hygiene, skills training for the handicapped, orphans and widows,&#13;
and training in mine detection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
4.16 Equipment. For all of the above sub-projects, SFKC may finance an equipment&#13;
component through a separate contract. Equipment eligible for financing includes basic medical&#13;
equipment for health facilities, desks, chairs and blackboards for education facilities and materials&#13;
for training programs. Separate eligibility criteria for equipment are outlined in the Operational&#13;
Manual.&#13;
4.17  Under the project, financing may also be provided for NGO-managed credit schemes for&#13;
micro and small enterprise development. However, such financing will depend on further&#13;
investigations into the demand for microcredit and the institutional capacity of NGOs providing&#13;
credit.&#13;
4.18  During negotiations, agreement was reached that SFKC would only approve those sub-&#13;
projects for which there are eligibility and appraisal criteria satisfactory to IDA (para. 8.2 (b)).&#13;
Though SFKC may finance new sub-project types in response to demand, it was agreed that no&#13;
change to (i) the menu of eligible sub-project types; (ii) the eligibility criteria, and (iii) the&#13;
$250,000 maximum sub-project cost limit would be made without prior IDA approval (para. 8.2&#13;
(c)).&#13;
4.19 Second Component: Institutional Support for SFKC (US$2.3 million): This&#13;
component would include financing of:&#13;
(a) SFKC staff salaries, vehicles, office equipment and operating expenses ($1.8 million). As&#13;
stated in the Social Fund statutes (Article 16 (b)), overhead costs (administrative and operating&#13;
expenses) over the five year period shall not exceed 8 percent of the total amount of SFKC's&#13;
resources expended during the same period. This is well within the range of overhead expenses of&#13;
other social funds. To ensure institutional efficiency, overhead expenditures will be programmed&#13;
and monitored as one of SFKC's institutional performance indicators.&#13;
(b) technical assistance and training ($0.5 million). Technical assistance would be provided to&#13;
help improve SFKC's operational capacity and internal procedures, including assistance to set-up&#13;
the MIS system, improve criteria and methodologies for appraisal and supervision, carry out&#13;
physical and technical audits, and beneficiary assessments. Necessary local training would also be&#13;
financed, such as computer skills for local staff. Financing would also be provided for study trips&#13;
abroad so that SFKC senior staff could visit other social funds and learn from their&#13;
implementation experience (see Annex E for details of technical assistance).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
CHAPTER V&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Social Fund Organizational Structure and Functions&#13;
5.1    The organizational structure of SFKC is based on the experience of other social funds and&#13;
takes into account the institutional context of Cambodia. As presented below SFKC would have&#13;
four operations departments: Finance and Administration, Promotions, Appraisal, and&#13;
Supervision. There would also be two Executive Support departments -- Operations and&#13;
Administration Advisory Unit and Internal Audit -- which would provide advice and information&#13;
to the General Director and Executive Committee. The functional responsibilities of these&#13;
departments are described in Annex F.&#13;

Operations Departnents&#13;
5.2    Staffing. Given the proposed scale of operations, it is estimated that SFKC would need&#13;
about 40 staff (professional and support) at the height of its operations. In addition to its own&#13;
staff, SFKC may subcontract a number of supervision tasks and professional services. Depending&#13;
on the workload and need, small regional offices may be opened in order to decentralize and&#13;
improve the cost-effectiveness of supervision and outreach activities. During negotiations,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
agreement was reached that SFKC's management level positions (i.e. department chief level and&#13;
above) will be staffed satisfactorily to IDA (para. 8.2 (d)).&#13;
5.3    SFKC's operating procedures, including criteria for project appraisal, contracting, and&#13;
supervision are presented in its Operational Manual (see Annex G for outline). The administrative&#13;
and financial procedures are contained in its Finance and Administrative Manual (Annex H).&#13;
During appraisal, SFKC's draft Operational and Administrative Manuals were reviewed in&#13;
substance and found satisfactory to IDA (para 8.1 (a)). Finalization of the Operational Manual,&#13;
including detailed eligibility and appraisal criteria for all sub-project types to be financed by IDA,&#13;
and the Administrative Manual, satisfactory to IDA, and their approval by SFKC's Board of&#13;
Directors is a condition of effectiveness (para. 8.3 (b)).&#13;
B.    Sub-project Cycle&#13;
Promotion, Application and Screening&#13;
5.4    The first step in the project cycle (Annex I) involves informing potential applicants and&#13;
sponsoring agencies of SFKC so as to ensure a solid pipeline of projects early on and ensure&#13;
effective coverage across regions of the country. The Promotions Department would be&#13;
responsible for this stage of the project cycle. Its promotional strategy, which will be finalized&#13;
prior to effectiveness, will include the following elements:&#13;
a) the preparation and wide dissemination of informational materials to line ministries, provincial&#13;
and district governments, communes, community groups and non-governmental organizations&#13;
and other relevant institutions about SFKC, including a brochure describing the eligibility&#13;
criteria and sub-projects menu, simple guidelines for the preparation of sub-project proposals,&#13;
and application forms tailored to each category of sub-project;&#13;
b) an initial, more targeted effort to inform key organizations with experience and capacity about&#13;
SFKC so as to stimulate high standard project applications that can be quickly financed to&#13;
stimulate a demonstration effect and build-up SFKC's credibility;&#13;
c) a series of regional workshops to further disseminate SFKC's purposes and procedures,&#13;
particularly in areas from which no or few project proposals are forthcoming. In the first year&#13;
of operation, the focus would be on facilitation -- helping communities to understand the&#13;
eligibility criteria, application procedures and to refine project proposals. In the second year,&#13;
SFKC would focus on reaching areas and groups that did not respond to the call for sub-&#13;
projects, particularly very poor regions that are underserved by public infrastructure and&#13;
services. Lack of response is most likely to be due to the security situation and/or the result&#13;
of weak capacity to prepare and implement projects. In the first instance, SFKC will have to&#13;
wait until the security situation improves to reach these areas. In the second instance, SFKC&#13;
would encourage potential sponsoring agencies to extend their activities to these areas, and&#13;
might provide assistance and training to local groups to help them prepare viable project&#13;
proposals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
5.5    Screening. The promotions staff would screen the sub-project applications to ensure that&#13;
they correspond with SFKC's eligibility principles and sub-project eligibility criteria, which have&#13;
been developed so as to be in line with sector policies and norms.&#13;
5.6   Lists of all eligible sub-projects would be submitted to the relevant line ministry for their&#13;
non-objection. In order to avoid bureaucratic delays, the ministries would be given five working&#13;
days to clear the projects. If no communication is received within this period, the project would&#13;
be deemed cleared for appraisal. During negotiations, agreement was reached between IDA and&#13;
the Government that no increase in this no-objection period could be made without prior IDA&#13;
approval (para. 8.2 (c)).&#13;
5.7    Demand-Management. SFKC is a demand-driven mechanism, financing projects for&#13;
which demand is forthcoming. However, the projects that are demanded may not be in accordance&#13;
with the objectives of SFKC. In order to orient demand such that it is consistent with the goals&#13;
of SFKC, the following operational instruments will be used: (a) eligibility principles; (b) project&#13;
menu; (c) eligibility criteria; (d) appraisal criteria; (e) poverty targeting; and (f) promotion and&#13;
outreach activities.&#13;
5.8    The eligibility principles (Annex C) lay out the broad policy framework governing SFKC's&#13;
activities. The menu of project types (Annex D) lists the different kinds of projects that can be&#13;
financed by SFKC. The menu of project types is supplemented by eligibility criteria that outline&#13;
the various activities that are eligible for SFKC financing under each project type. SFKC's&#13;
appraisal criteria further narrow down the activities and the form in which they will be acceptable&#13;
for SFKC financing. Only project proposals that are consistent with SFKC's eligibility principles,&#13;
project menu and eligibility criteria will be considered eligible for SFKC appraisal.&#13;
5.9   Poverty Targeting. SFKC may receive more eligible project proposals than it can&#13;
appraise or finance. In order to deal with this possibility, SFKC will use three simple poverty&#13;
targeting criteria to rank the order in which sub-projects are appraised (in addition to grouping&#13;
appraisals in the same region together for logistical efficiency):&#13;
Intended Beneficiaries: Project proposals, such as training facilities, whose intended beneficiaries&#13;
are poor and vulnerable groups such as female-headed households and the handicapped will&#13;
receive a rank of one. Ranks of two and three will be assigned to project proposals whose&#13;
intended beneficiaries are relatively less poor and vulnerable groups.&#13;
Type of Project: Project proposals with the highest social impact will receive a rank of one.&#13;
Ranks of two and three will be assigned to project proposals with a lower social impact.&#13;
Provincial Ceiling: SFKC will establish provincial limits on the portfolio share going to each&#13;
province based on the province's relative access to basic social services and its population. As&#13;
the SFKC starts disbursing, the provinces will be ranked based on the percentage of the allocated&#13;
portfolio share they have already received from SFKC; the province that has received the least&#13;
percentage of its allocation will be assigned a rank of one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
5.10  In ranking project proposals for appraisal, SFKC will regard the beneficiary rank as the&#13;
overriding rank. If two project proposals have the same beneficiary rank, the rank for the project&#13;
type willl determine which proposal is prioritized for appraisal. If two project proposals have the&#13;
same beneficiary rank and the same project type rank, the rank for the provincial ceiling will&#13;
determine the choice of the project proposal.&#13;
Appraisal&#13;
5.11   The appraisal division would appraise the projects in the field based on simple technical,&#13;
economic, institutional, social and environmental criteria appropfiate to each of the sub-project&#13;
categories, as specified in SFKC's Operational Manual.&#13;
a) The technical criteria for sub-project appraisal would be developed specifically for each sub-&#13;
project type based on the existing norms available from the respective line ministries to ensure&#13;
sectoral coherence and compatibility. Technical appraisal would confirm that the project&#13;
design and specifications complies with these norms. It would also ensure that infrastructure,&#13;
equipment and other inputs are consistent in scale, quality, cost and content with the proposed&#13;
activities of the sub-project and that implementation is technically feasible.&#13;
b) Economic analysis. A database of regional unit costs for project inputs would serve as the&#13;
basis for the economic analysis. SFKC would develop ranges for cost per beneficiary and cost&#13;
per unit for each sub-project type. Based on this information, indicators of cost effectiveness&#13;
would be calculated and used as appraisal criteria. During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached that SFKC would review and update their unit cost database at least every six months&#13;
and submit the updated information to IDA for ex-post review (para. 8.2 (e)).&#13;
c) Social analysis would be done to gather basic data on the number and breakdown of the&#13;
direct beneficiaries of the project and the demographic and social characteristics of the&#13;
catchment area. As well as providing a basis for appraisal, this would provide base data for&#13;
future studies of the social and economic impact of SFKC-financed projects. Information on&#13;
employment generation would also be collected during appraisal. Appraisers would also make&#13;
sure that the project is well-targeted based on SFKC's targeting policies.&#13;
d) Institutional analysis would be most important in social services project where the NGO&#13;
applicant is actually implementing the project. In such projects, an institutional analysis would&#13;
be carried out to appraise whether the applicant has the capacity to successfully implement the&#13;
proposed project. For all projects, the appraisal staff would also ensure that the applicant or&#13;
appropriate entity has the capacity to supervise the project and cover the operation and&#13;
maintenance costs after project completion. The appraisers would confirm the nature and&#13;
amount of the beneficiaries' counterpart contribution to the project, which must total a&#13;
minimum of 5 percent of the sub-project cost, and would gain assurances that operational and&#13;
maintenance costs of the sub-project will be covered. During appraisal, appraisal staff will&#13;
also be required to consult and coordinate with the provincial and district level governments&#13;
to ensure that there is no overlap with other planned or ongoing activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
e) Environmental analysis would be undertaken on all projects according to routine&#13;
environmental appraisal criteria, although given the nature and small-size of sub-projects no&#13;
significant environmental impacts are anticipated. For any projects that are likely to have an&#13;
adverse environmental impact above a specified threshold, SFKC would ensure measures were&#13;
taken to mitigate any risks in the project design. SFKC may also reject any sub-project&#13;
applications which it considers involve excessive environmental risk. The Bank would provide&#13;
technical assistance to help SFKC develop environmental assessment (EA) guidelines and train&#13;
appraisal staff in EA procedures.&#13;
Approval Procedures and Bank Review&#13;
5.12  Once appraised, the project dossiers would be passed to the Executive Committee, which&#13;
would meet at least once every two weeks, and would have formal responsibility for approval or&#13;
rejection of sub-project proposals, or request that they be revised and resubmitted. If approved,&#13;
sub-projects proposals would be submitted for clearance by IDA. Taking into consideration the&#13;
nature, size and large number of expected sub-projects and the demands on Bank supervision, the&#13;
following procedures would apply to all sub-projects financed by IDA: for civil works contracts&#13;
over $100,000 and equipment contracts over US$50,000, approval would be required prior to&#13;
contract signing and full documentation would have to be submitted; for projects under these&#13;
limits, IDA would carry out an ex post review of a random selection of sub-projects, based on&#13;
summary project data sheets, acceptable to IDA. During negotiations, agreements to these sub-&#13;
project review arrangements were reached with the Government (para 8.2 (f))&#13;
Contracting, Implementation and Supervision&#13;
5.13  Upon approval of a sub-project, the applicant or sponsoring agency (if applicable) would&#13;
select the implementing agency in accordance with Bank procurement procedures as directed by&#13;
SFKC. The nature of the implementing agency will vary depending on the type of project. In the&#13;
case of construction projects, a local private sector contractor will normally be hired to carry out&#13;
the work. For other projects, such as support for training programs, the implementing agency&#13;
might be, for example, an NGO. During negotiations, it was agreed that a sub-project contract&#13;
(or "sub-grant agreement"), satisfactory to IDA, will be signed by SFKC, the applicant,&#13;
sponsoring agency (if applicable) and the implementing agency for each sub-project (para. 8.2&#13;
(g)). This standard sub-grant agreement will be finalized prior to credit effectiveness and included&#13;
in the Operational Manual.&#13;
5.14  Disbursements would be made to the implementing agency based on work completed and&#13;
confirmed during site supervision visits by SFKC supervision staff. The most likely disbursement&#13;
method would be through the local branch office of a commercial bank, although, final decisions&#13;
as to the exact method of payment would be made prior to effectiveness based on the trial period&#13;
implementation experience (see para. 6.5).&#13;
5.15  To increase controls on sub-project execution, contingencies would not be included in&#13;
sub-project budgets. Changes in standard sub-project costs, which are not expected to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
frequent given the accuracy and regular updating of the unit cost database and the short time&#13;
frame of sub-project execution, would be handled through separate requests for a budget change.&#13;
5.16  Supervision of sub-project implementation would occur at three levels. First, SFKC&#13;
would contract external on-site technical supervisors, the cost of which would be included in the&#13;
sub-project cost and is estimated not to exceed five percent. Terms of reference and standard&#13;
contracts for external supervision would be included in the Operational Manual. Second, the&#13;
applicant, as representative of the direct beneficiaries, would also supervise and monitor the&#13;
progress and quality of construction. Both the external supervisor and the applicant would verify&#13;
completion of the works before requesting disbursement. Third, SFKC staff from the Supervision&#13;
Department would monitor sub-project implementation directly. Supervision would involve&#13;
monthly visits (or sooner, on demand from the external supervisor or applicant) to sub-project&#13;
sites to validate that works are advancing and to authorize requested disbursements. In addition,&#13;
as a further level of quality control, local consultants would be contracted to carry out physical&#13;
audits on a random sample of sub-projects to evaluate their technical quality, their operational and&#13;
maintenance cost coverage, and provide feedback to SFKC on the adequacy of the appraisal and&#13;
supervision system (see para. 6.20).&#13;
C.   Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
5.17 Management Information System. SFKC would establish a computerized management&#13;
information system (MIS) as a tool to monitor the sub-project cycle and the overall performance&#13;
of SFKC. It would also facilitate the production of reports on SFKC's performance. The MIS,&#13;
which is being developed with technical inputs and assistance from other social funds, will permit&#13;
SFKC to track its project pipeline, resource flows and their relation to its targeting policies and&#13;
criteria.&#13;
5.18  The MIS would provide a wide range of information on the operational activities of the&#13;
SFKC and would also complement the financial and accounting database system. As a condition&#13;
of effectiveness the Management Information System shall have been established by SFKC,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, and shall be fully operational (para. 8.3 (c)).&#13;
5.19  Portfolio Performance Indicators. A major function of the MIS will be to produce&#13;
reports on indicators established to monitor the performance of SFKC in relation to its overall&#13;
objectives. Monitorable indicators of SFKC's capacity, efficiency, and attainment of policy&#13;
objectives were agreed at appraisal (Annex J). These indicators include measures of the SFKC's&#13;
overall disbursements, the amount and number of sub-projects approved, appraised and&#13;
implemented, the number of direct beneficiaries, the number of man-months of employment&#13;
created and overhead costs per total amount disbursed. Agreement between the Government and&#13;
IDA on the use of portfolio performance indicators were reached during negotiations (para. 8.2&#13;
(h)). Annual performance targets will be reviewed and revised annually as part of SFKC's annual&#13;
portfolio review exercise.&#13;
5.20  External Impact Evaluations. In order to evaluate the social and economic impact of&#13;
SFKC-financed projects, SFKC will contract local and/or international consultants to carry out&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
evaluations of sub-projects on a sample basis. A beneficiary assessment methodology will be used&#13;
to gain the feedback of SFKC's clients -- sub-project beneficiaries, applicants, sponsoring&#13;
agencies and implementing agencies -- on how SFKC is responding to their needs and to gather&#13;
data on the impact of the sub-projects. Other surveys and impact evaluations may also be carried&#13;
out on specific sub-project types. Information from these assessments will be used by SFKC&#13;
management to make adjustments to their policies and procedures so as to improve fulfillmenit of&#13;
their objectives and responsiveness to client concerns.&#13;
D.   Reporting and Supervision&#13;
5.21  The following reporting requirements would apply to the project:&#13;
(i) each month SFKC would submit to IDA standard monthly progress reports according to an&#13;
agreed upon format, and based on information from the MIS system;&#13;
(ii) an annual portfolio review exercise would be undertaken by SFKC in collaboration with&#13;
IDA. This would include an assessment of performance indicators, sub-projects by type and&#13;
location, cash-flow projections, recurrent and maintenance cost coverage, and operational&#13;
procedures, including environmental assessment procedures. After each review, an annual budget&#13;
and work program, including proposals as to how to improve procedures so as to fulfill SFKC's&#13;
targeting policies and criteria, reviewed and found satisfactory by IDA, would be prepared and&#13;
would subsequently be carried out by SFKC;&#13;
(iii) based on this review exercise, SFKC would prepare an annual report to be ratified by its&#13;
Board of Directors and submitted to IDA, no later than three months after the first year of&#13;
operations and annually therea%.-r. Annual reports would contain key performance indicators of&#13;
SFKC together with reporting on technical assistance and training efforts, and the results of any&#13;
monitoring and impact evaluation studies; and&#13;
(iv) a final report and evaluation of the outcome of the proposed project would be prepared by&#13;
SFKC no later than six months after the closing date.&#13;
5.22  Mid-term Review. The Bank and SFKC would carry out a joint mid-term review to&#13;
evaluate the performance of SFKC. This exercise would be scheduled to occur promptly after&#13;
more than 50% of the credit has been disbursed, or otherwise no later than December 31, 1997.&#13;
The mid-term review is designed to provide an opportunity to evaluate the experience of SFKC,&#13;
both at an operational level as well as in the context of the Government's overall social policy and&#13;
related programs. At the end of the review, a mid-term review report would be submitted to IDA&#13;
highlighting any major problems, issues and bottlenecks identified during the review process and&#13;
the proposals for resolving them and fulfilling the goals of the project. The Government's&#13;
agreement to these review and reporting requirements was obtained during negotiations (paras.&#13;
8.2 (i) and (i)).&#13;
5.23  Bank Supervision. Due to the demand-driven nature of SFKC, the large number of sub-&#13;
projects to be reviewed, the newness of the institution and the importance of discouraging&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
financial misallocations, intensive supervision is required by IDA. This is in keeping with the&#13;
experience of other social funds. Joint supervision missions would be carried out with any other&#13;
donor agencies. An estimated 2-3 supervision missions, totaling 20-30 staff weeks, would be&#13;
required annually. To reduce the costs of supervision, consultants would be hired to review&#13;
selected aspects of SFKC's operations and to carry out physical audits of the civil works. A&#13;
supervision plan is available in the project file.&#13;
F.    Environmental Impact&#13;
5.24  The proposed project has been assigned a "B" environmental classification. Environmental&#13;
impact assessments will be carried out as part of the appraisal process, and technical assistance&#13;
will be provided to SFKC to develop environmental assessment policies and procedures. If&#13;
adverse impacts are foreseen, necessary mitigating measures, if not already planned, would be&#13;
incorporated into the sub-project design at appraisal. SFKC may also reject sub-project proposals&#13;
on the grounds that they involve excessive environmental risk. The adequacy of SFKC's&#13;
environmental procedures would be assessed by IDA as part of the annual review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

21&#13;
CHAPTER VI&#13;
PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
A.   Estimated Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
6.1   Project Costs. The total project cost, expressed in January 1995 prices, is estimated at&#13;
US$ 22.2 million, net of taxes and duties. The foreign exchange costs amount to US$6.3 million&#13;
representing approximately 28 percent of the total project cost. A summary of project costs by&#13;
component is shown in Table 6.1 with a detailed cost table provided in Annex K.&#13;

Total Project Cost                         15.93      6.27      22.20&#13;
6.2   A total of US$18.9 mnillion, or 85 percent, of the total project cost is allocated to finance&#13;
sub-projects. Based on estimated demand, indicative figures are provided for the breakdown&#13;
among sub-project categories. However, given the fact that SFKC is a financial intermediary and&#13;
is demand-driven by nature, the actual breakdown will depend on demand and operational&#13;
experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
6.3   No contingencies have been included for sub-projects as any increase in individual sub-&#13;
project costs would be administered through change orders (see para. 5.16) and absorbed by the&#13;
sub-project budget, resulting in an overall reduction in the number of sub-projects executed.&#13;
Institutional support to SFKC (excluding technical assistance and training) accounts for US$ 1.8&#13;
million or 8 percent of total project cost. This is in line with the requirements of SFKC's Statutes.&#13;
Costs of training and technical assistance for SFKC are estimated at $0.5 million for the project.&#13;
Annex E lists the expected technical assistance requirements during the project.&#13;
6.4   Financing Plan. The proposed credit of US$20 million would finance about 90 percent&#13;
of total project costs over the five year period. The financing plan is shown in Table 6.2. The&#13;
Government will contribute the equivalent of US$1.2 million in budgetary and in-kind support. In&#13;
addition, to enhance sub-project sustainability and local ownership, applicants and/or sponsoring&#13;
agencies will be required to contribute a minimum of 5 percent of the sub-project cost in the form&#13;
of project preparation and supervision services, materials, specialized construction equipment and&#13;
other contributions defined in the eligibility criteria according to sub-project type. These&#13;
contributions may be mobilized from the direct beneficiaries of the sub-project. However, SFKC&#13;
will not require labor contributions from beneficiaries, as one of the main objectives of the project&#13;
is to increase incomes through employment generation. During negotiations, the Government&#13;
provided assurances on the provision of the specified amount of government counterpart&#13;
financing each year, and agreed that applicants/sponsors would be obligated by SFKC to&#13;
contribute a minimum of 5 percent of the sub-project cost as counterpart contribution (para. 8.2&#13;
(k)).&#13;

6.5   Project preparation activities have been expedited by resources, including a PHRD grant&#13;
of $504,000, approved in December 1994. This grant money has been used to finance technical&#13;
assistance to assist the Project Preparation Unit develop SFKC operational and administrative&#13;
procedures and to finance operating expenses. Out of the proposed credit, up to a maximum of&#13;
US$1 million equivalent (or 5% of the total credit) will be available for retroactive financing to&#13;
allow SFKC to finance trial sub-projects prior to effectiveness. This trial implementation period&#13;
would allow SFKC to test and improve its operational and administrative procedures based on&#13;
practical experience and lessons learned in the process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
6.6   Corinancing. Consistent with the experience of other social funds, it is expected that&#13;
SFKC, if successful, will be able to attract additional financing to expand its activities during the&#13;
course of the project. Opportunities to obtain financing for the project are already being&#13;
explored; preliminary discussions have been held with USAID and the Government of Japan and&#13;
further discussions are planned.&#13;
B.    Procurement&#13;
6.7   All procurement of civil works, goods and services financed by IDA will be carried out in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines (see Annex L for a summary matrix of procurement and&#13;
disbursement methods).&#13;
6.8   Civil works. No international competitive bidding is expected under the proposed project&#13;
given the small size of sub-project contracts -- the maximum sub-project cost is $250,000, with&#13;
the average sub-project cost estimated to be around $25,000. Local competitive bidding (LCB)&#13;
procedures, acceptable to IDA, would apply to civil works contracts valued between $100,000&#13;
and $250,000. Approximately US$4 million of civil works contracts are expected to be awarded&#13;
through LCB. Civil works contracts valued between $50,000 and $100,000 would be awarded&#13;
through local shopping procedures, with an expected aggregate amount to be financed by IDA of&#13;
US$3.015 million. A unit cost data base maintained by SFKC will be used to check the&#13;
competitiveness of quotes under local shopping procedures. For sub-projects below US$50,000 a&#13;
system of direct contracting would apply, with strict application of unit costs supplied by SFKC.&#13;
Direct contracting is justified given the preponderance of small-scale, labor-intensive works in&#13;
scattered and remote areas and would also encourage contractors to expand their operations to&#13;
these areas. Direct contracting would be allowed up to an aggregate amount to be financed by&#13;
IDA of US$5 .515 million. Packaging groups of sub-projects for procurement purposes is unlikely&#13;
to be possible except under circumstances in which a sponsoring agency has applied for a package&#13;
of investments.&#13;
6.9    Applicants or sponsoring agencies, if the latter participates in the application, would be&#13;
responsible for procurement. In the case of local competitive bidding, SFKC would provide the&#13;
applicant/sponsoring agency with a package of basic documents, including a description of the&#13;
procedures to be followed. During negotiations, agreement was reached that standard bidding&#13;
documents and LCB procurement procedures acceptable to IDA will be used for procurement&#13;
under the project (para. 8.2 (1)).&#13;

1/ Figures in parentheses are the estimated amounts to be financed by IDA.&#13;
2/ Under the "Other" category, SFKC Institutional Support includes consulting services procured following Bank&#13;
guidelines for the Use of Consultants, and salaries, fees and other operating costs (travel, utilities, and minor office&#13;
supplies), for which procurement procedures would not be applicable. Services sub-projects ($1.1 million) and&#13;
small NGO-run community implemented social infrastructure projects ($0.6 million), such as latrines, would not&#13;
be governed by Bank procurement guidelines. The unallocated amount ($1 million) is also included under the&#13;
"other" category until it is allocated.&#13;
6.10   The main control on direct contracting would be SFKC's strict adherence to the costs&#13;
provided in their regional cost database which will be updated regularly. All cost estimates for&#13;
sub-projects will have to fall within the cost limits determined by the data base. This has proved&#13;
an effective tool for controlling sub-project costing and procurement in other social funds. SFKC&#13;
would need to demonstrate that the costs of the sub-projects are competitive with other similar&#13;
projects, particularly those financed under World Bank-financed operations. As an additional&#13;
safeguard, SFKC would keep a data base on the number, amount and location of sub-projects&#13;
implemented by individual contractors and would limit the total value of contracts that can be&#13;
awarded through direct contracting to any one contractor to US$300,000. These direct&#13;
contracting guidelines would be agreed upon and included in the Operational Manual. During&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
negotiations agreement was reached between IDA and the Government that no change can be&#13;
made to the US$300,000 ceiling amount awarded to any one contractor through direct&#13;
contracting procedures within the life of the project without prior IDA approval (para. 8.2 (c)).&#13;
6.11  Equipment and Goods. Goods and equipment to be procured under the project's&#13;
institutional support component include vehicles, computers and office equipment. Under the&#13;
sub-project component, they include tools, furniture and basic equipment for health clinics,&#13;
schools and other facilities. Packages of goods and equipment above $100,000, where&#13;
international competitive bidding procedures would apply, are not anticipated. For goods and&#13;
equipment costing between $50,000 and $100,000, LCB procedures acceptable to IDA would&#13;
apply. An anticipated US$125,000 of equipment (including vehicles) under the institutional&#13;
support component is expected to be purchased under LCB. Procurement would be carried out&#13;
by the applicant/sponsoring agency in accordance with the guidelines provided by SFKC. For&#13;
procurement of goods and equipment below $50,000, local shopping procedures would apply,&#13;
with an aggregate amount of US$113,200 for the institutional support component and US$3.5&#13;
million for sub-projects.&#13;
6.12  Consultant Services and Training. About US$500,000 would be allocated to&#13;
consultant services and training under the project. The selection and appointment of consultants&#13;
would be done in accordance with the 1981 World Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants,&#13;
including the contracting of SFKC higher level professional and technical personnel.&#13;
6.13  Categories not Applicable to Procurement Arrangements. Standard procurement&#13;
arrangements would not apply to SFKC operating expenses (salaries, utilities, travel and minor&#13;
office supplies). NGO-implemented social services projects and some small NGO-managed social&#13;
projects, such as latrine construction, implemented by local communities would also not be&#13;
governed by standard procurement procedures.&#13;
6.14  Bank Review. Bank review procedures for sub-projects are provided in para. 5.13. In&#13;
addition, to ensure compliance with agreed procurement arrangements, IDA would require prior&#13;
review of all LCB contracts. Prior Bank review would also be required for all contracts for the&#13;
employment of consultant firms above $100,000 and for the employment of individual consultants&#13;
above $50,000. For all consultant services (firms and individuals) and training contracts, IDA&#13;
would review terms of reference. For SFKC professional staff, prior review would only be&#13;
required for management positions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
C.    Disbursements&#13;
6.15  The proposed World Bank loan would be disbursed over a period of about four years. A&#13;
disbursement profile is presented in Annex M. This profile is based on anticipated demand and&#13;
appraised institutional capacity.&#13;
Table 6.4: Estimated IDA Disbursement Schedule&#13;

6.16  Disbursements would be made against the following categories of expenditures: (a) sub-&#13;
project grants: 100 percent of sub-grant amounts disbursed by SFKC as approved according to&#13;
SFKC's eligibility and appraisal criteria; (b) operating costs including (i) salaries: 100 percent of&#13;
eligible expenditures (net of taxes), and (ii) operating expenses: 80 percent of eligible&#13;
expenditures; (c) equipment (including vehicles). 100 percent of foreign expenditures, 100&#13;
percent of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 90 percent of local expenditures for other&#13;
items procured locally; and (d) technical assistance and training: 100 percent of expenditures&#13;
(net of taxes).&#13;
6.17 Documentation of Expenditure. For civil works under US$100,000, equipment under&#13;
US$50,000, special NGO-managed social services projects, Social Fund administrative&#13;
expenditures and technical assistance contracts, withdrawal applications will be supported by&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). For civil works over US$100,000 and equipment over&#13;
US$50,000, withdrawal applications would be supported by full documentation. A Special&#13;
Account would be opened at the National Bank of Cambodia with an initial authorized amount of&#13;
US$1 million equivalent, which would subsequently be adjusted based on expected disbursement&#13;
flows up to the authorized allocation of US$2 million equivalent. The Government agreed to the&#13;
above disbursement arrangements during negotiations (para. 8.2 (m)). In accordance with the&#13;
provision for retroactive financing (see para. 6.5), withdrawals, in an aggregate amount not to&#13;
exceed US$1 million equivalent, may be made on account of payments made for expenditures&#13;
under the sub-grants category after March 1, 1995 and prior to credit effectiveness.&#13;
D.   Accounts and Auditing&#13;
6.18  SFKC's Finance and Administrative Department will be responsible for the overall&#13;
financial management of SFKC. It will develop and implement an adequate computer-based MIS&#13;
and accounting system that will enable SFKC to provide quick and accountable financial&#13;
information on sub-projects and administrative expenditures. SFKC will also hire an Internal&#13;
Auditor who will be responsible for conducting specific operational and administrative audits.&#13;
These audits reports will be used as management tools to identify and take corrective actions if&#13;
necessary to ensure the correct uses of funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
6.19  External financial audits will be performed on an annual basis through the contracting of&#13;
an internationally recognized independent accounting firm acceptable to IDA. The external&#13;
auditing firm will be responsible for auditing all project accounts, the special account (dollars),&#13;
and all disbursement requests made against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). SFKC submitted&#13;
draft terms of reference for the external audit prior to negotiations (para. 8.1 (b)). During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that audits will be conducted by an independent private&#13;
extemal auditor acceptable to IDA and will follow terms of reference in accordance with&#13;
appropriate auditing standards, as approved by IDA; and that SFKC will send a copy of the&#13;
external audit report to IDA within four months after the close of each fiscal year (para. 8.2 (n)).&#13;
The report will certify that SFKC is using SFKC's resources for the purposes for which they were&#13;
provided and that disbursements and procurement for all contracts are being carried out in&#13;
accordance with the agreed guidelines and IDA's procurement regulations.&#13;
6.20  External technical audits will also be carried out by local consultants to assess the&#13;
technical quality of SFKC-financed projects. Information from this survey will provide feedback&#13;
to SFKC, in particular the Supervision Department, on the quality of the works carried out and&#13;
recommendations as to how to improve quality. The technical evaluation will also provide an&#13;
opportunity to assess whether the operational and maintenance costs of SFKC-financed projects&#13;
are being covered. The SFKC would adjust its targeting and eligibility priorities in accordance&#13;
with the audit's findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

CHAPTER VII&#13;
BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.    Benefits&#13;
7.1    The major benefits of the project are (i) reconstruction and rehabilitation of public&#13;
infrastructure and services with the associated health, educational and economic benefits for the&#13;
poor; (ii) creation of short-term employment opportunities; (iii) the development of the local&#13;
construction industry; (iv) increased participation of communities in local decision-making and&#13;
management of small-scale development projects; and (v) increased line ministry experience and&#13;
capacity to develop investment criteria for local infrastructure investment. The project would also&#13;
assist donor coordination by providing a mechanism through which donors may wish to channel&#13;
their resources to quality sub-projects.&#13;
B.    Risks&#13;
7.2    The risks associated with this project are (i) political interference in the Fund's operations;&#13;
(ii) misallocation of financial resources; (iii) shortage of qualified staff; and (iv) lack of&#13;
sustainability, particularly the risk that maintenance and recurrent costs will not be covered. An&#13;
added risk in Cambodia is continued insecurity which could make travel within parts of the&#13;
country difficult.&#13;
7.3   Preparation of the project has incorporated the lessons from other social funds so as to&#13;
minimize these risks. In particular, the risks of political interference and financial misallocation&#13;
will be mitigated by incorporating procedures that ensure autonomy and transparency of the&#13;
SFKC's operations, including rigorous eligibility and appraisal criteria, provisions for prior Bank&#13;
approval, adherence to strict unit cost ceilings for sub-projects, and internal and external auditing.&#13;
7.4    Lack of qualified staff is being addressed by setting competitive salaries and advertising&#13;
positions widely. Qualified applicants have come forward, and SFKC is currently well staffed.&#13;
The problem of sustainability is being addressed by encouraging community involvement and&#13;
commitment throughout the project cycle, requiring a minimum beneficiary contribution,&#13;
obtaining written assurances of the coverage of recurrent/maintenance costs from the appropriate&#13;
entities during sub-project appraisal, and through external audit procedures. Under present&#13;
conditions, the security risk is not considered a major constraint to the implementation of the&#13;
project as large areas of the country remain secure. Given the flexibility of SFKC procedures, the&#13;
SFKC will be able to direct its operations to secure areas. It is anticipated that applications from&#13;
secure areas should provide sufficient demand to fully utilize its resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

k) the Government will provide the specified amount of counterpart funds, and sub-&#13;
project applicants/sponsors will be obligated by SFKC to contribute the 5 percent&#13;
minimum counterpart contribution (para. 6.4);&#13;
1) standard bidding documents and LCB procurement procedures acceptable to IDA will&#13;
be used for procurement under the project (para. 6.9);&#13;
m) the Government will carry out specified disbursement arrangements, including the&#13;

and will follow terms of reference in accordance with appropriate auditing principles,&#13;
as approved by IDA, and such audits will be submitted to IDA within four months of&#13;
the close of each fiscal year (para. 6.19).&#13;
8.3    During negotiations, agreement was reached that the following will be conditions of credit&#13;
effectiveness:&#13;
a) the Fund Agreement shall have been signed and entered into effect between the&#13;
Government and SFKC (para. 4.3);&#13;
b) finalization of the Operational and Administrative Manuals, satisfactory to IDA, and&#13;
their adoption by SFKC's Board of Directors (para. 5.3); and&#13;
c) the Management Information System shall have been established by SFKC,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, and shall be fully operational (para. 5.18).&#13;
Recommendation.  Subject to the above conditions and assurances, the proposed project&#13;
constitutes a suitable basis for a Development Credit of SDR 13.4 million (US$20 million&#13;

ANNEX C&#13;
Page 1 of 2&#13;
KINGDOM OF CAMBODIA&#13;
SOCIAL FUND PROJECT&#13;
ELIGIBILITY PRINCIPLES&#13;
1. Poverty Targeting: Projects shall benefit the poor. The choice of the type of project can&#13;
ensure high coverage of poor people (" self-targeting"). Infiastructure improvement of primary&#13;
schools rather than of universities, for example, and of health clinics rather than of tertiary&#13;
hospitals would by their nature benefit the poor. Projects will also be targeted towards the&#13;
poorest regions according to a regional poverty index, based on relative regional access to social&#13;
services.&#13;
2. Eligible Applicants: The Social Fund will consider funding requests from public and private&#13;
entities representing communities and government. The Social Fund will not provide resources&#13;
directly to individuals to finance commercial undertakings or improve private property.&#13;
3. Government Programs and Expenditures: The Social Fund shall not supplement recurrent&#13;
budget expenditures of Government, nor shall it serve to replace normal sectoral activities and&#13;
responsibilities of the Government.&#13;
4. Sustainability: The Social Fund shall not finance vehicles, generators, and other equipment that&#13;
require continuous recurrent costs to operate.&#13;
5. Project Implementation: The Social Fund will not implement projects itself, but will rely on the&#13;
local capacity of both the sponsoring group and the implementing agency who will be&#13;
responsible for project implementation. Great importance is given, therefore, to appraising the&#13;
capacity of the implementing agencies to ensure the successful completion of the projects.&#13;
6. Project Identification and Sponsorship: The Social Fund shall not identify, initiate or sponsor&#13;
projects directly. Instead, it will respond to the demand for projects as proposed by community&#13;
groups and local governments or their sponsoring agencies. The Social Fund, government&#13;
agencies and other groups will promote, encourage and orient the demand for project financing.&#13;
7. Productive Investments: Projects shall be investments in social and economic productivity.&#13;
Projects that do not directly increase the productivity of the poor, such as construction of sport&#13;
fields and public administration buildings, shall not be eligible. Financing of recurrent costs will&#13;
not be eligible. Projects financing relief activities shall not be eligible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
ANNEX C&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
8. Labor vs. Capital Intensive:  The Social Fund's objective of providing enployment&#13;
opportunities for the poor means that projects should be labor intensive or otherwise generate a&#13;
significant social impact (education and health infrastructure projects are not as labor intensive&#13;
as other types of infiastructure, but their social impact might be significant). Large scale&#13;
projects such as paved roads, high tech bridges and dams that require the use of heavy&#13;
equipment are not labor intensive and therefore are not eligible. Equipment purchases may have&#13;
a social impact (primary health equipment, school desks) and are justified, but applications&#13;
requesting high cost equipment that would make a project capital intensive (generators, dental&#13;
equipment, hospital diagnostic equipment) would not be accepted.&#13;
9. Project Costs and Benefits: Projects shall employ least cost designs and deliver the maximum&#13;
benefits for a given cost. Projects shall be appraised according to standard methods of&#13;
measuring costs and benefits.&#13;
10. Sectoral Policies: All Social Fund projects shall be consistent with national sectoral policies.&#13;
For example, all health and education infrastructure must comply with sectoral policies and&#13;
regulations.&#13;

SOCIAL FUND PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING&#13;
Objective&#13;
The technical assistance and training component of the Social Fund Project is designed to strengthen&#13;
the operational capacity of SFKC, by improving its overall eligibility and appraisal criteria and&#13;
procedures, and thus improve the quality of its sub-projects while improving their social impact.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
External Audits: SFKC will hire an internationally recognized local firm to produce the annual&#13;
audits, as required by IDA. In addition local expertise will be hired to carry out a physical audit of&#13;
a sample of projects to assess their technical quality. Information from this technical study will&#13;
provide feedback to SFKC the overall cost of the project and accountability of funds used, as well&#13;
as on the quality of the works carried out. Based on this, recommendations would be made as to&#13;
how to improve criteria, procedures, and thus the quality of projects. In addition, the technical audit&#13;
will provide an opportunity to assess whether the operational and maintenance costs of SFKC-&#13;
financed projects are being covered.&#13;
MIS Advisor: Within the first year of operations, SFKC will hire a local expert to advise on the&#13;
equipment to be purchased by the SFKC, to design the network to be installed, and to create a&#13;
database system that enables the management of the overall project cycle, as well as all financing&#13;
operations.&#13;
Financial Management TA: In order to assist the SFKC in developing and improving its financial&#13;
programming and accounting procedures, local expertise may be hired.&#13;
Operational and Management Advisor: During the initial stage of SFKC operations, while the&#13;
operational and financial manuals are being fine-tuned based on actual operational experience,&#13;
international TA will be hired to advise and assist the General Director on the overall improvement&#13;
of procedures and criteria.&#13;
New Sub-projects: For any type of sub-project not yet identified in the sub-projects menu but of&#13;
interest to SFKC, local or international expertise will be hired to provide assistance in the design of&#13;
eligibility, appraisal, and supervision criteria for each new type of sub-project.&#13;
Promotion: In accordance with the need to improve and increase SFKC's outreach, local technical&#13;
assistance will be hired to assist the Promotions Department in organizing workshops with potential&#13;
applicants, as well as in designing regional or national information campaigns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
ANNEX E&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
Legal Services: Part time legal services will be hired locally by SFKC to provide advice on legal&#13;
issues as and when they arise. The legal expert will verify that all policies, procedures and&#13;
regulations approved by the SFKC comply with national laws. In addition the legal expert will&#13;
oversee the compliance of all contracts and agreements that SFKC might have with third parties.&#13;
Computer and MIS Training: To improve the overall management of SFKC, the necessary local&#13;
expertise will be hired in order to train all professional and support staff of SFKC in the use of&#13;
computers and the MIS system.&#13;
Visits to Funds Abroad: Once SFKC has started operations, Department Directors will travel&#13;
abroad to visit other operating Social Funds so as to learn from their operational experience.&#13;
Impact Evaluations: In order to evaluate the social and economic impact of SFKC-financed&#13;
projects, SFKC will contract local and/or international consultants to carry out evaluations of sub-&#13;
projects on a sample basis. A beneficiary assessment methodology will be used to gain the feedback&#13;
of SFKC's clients -- sub-project beneficiaries, applicants, sponsoring agencies and implementing&#13;
agencies -- on how SFKC is responding to their needs and to gather data on the impact of the sub-&#13;
projects. Other surveys and impact evaluations may also be carried out on specific sub-project&#13;
types in order to evaluate whether operational procedures are in line with the eligibility criteria and&#13;
to evaluate the social and economic impact of specific sub-project types. Information from these&#13;
assessments will be used by SFKC management to make adjustments to their procedures so as to&#13;
improve fulfillment of their objectives and responsiveness to client concerns.&#13;
