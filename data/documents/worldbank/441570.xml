Competition in Water and Sanitation&#13;
The Role of Small-Scale Entrepreneurs&#13;
Tova Alaila Solo    In water and sanitation there has always been a belief that the sector has a high degree of&#13;
natural monopoly. But competition is widespread at the low-income end of the retail level in&#13;
developing countries. There are no inherent monopoly characteristics in, for example, reselling&#13;
water by the bucket. This Note explores the diversity of small scale entrepreneurs and their role&#13;
in meeting unserved niches of the water and sanitation market. Indeed, small enterprises often&#13;
account for a larger share of the market than incumbent utilities and they are well placed to&#13;
complement and even compete with trunk concessions and public companies in tailoring&#13;
services to the poor. So in designing concessions or any long term rules for the sector,&#13;
governments should take account of existing or potential small providers.&#13;
In most cities in developing countries, more than&#13;
