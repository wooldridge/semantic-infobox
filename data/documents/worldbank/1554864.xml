ABSTRACT&#13;
The Effect of Piped Water on Early Childhood&#13;
Mortality in Urban Brazil, 1970 to 1976&#13;
This paper utilizes data on the ratio of surviving children and other&#13;
variables for a sub-sample of mothers aged 20 - 29 from the 1970 Brazilian&#13;
population census and the 1976 Brazilian National Household Survey (PNAD) to'&#13;
analyze the impact of increased access to piped water in urban households on&#13;
trends and income class differentials in child mortality.         Path analytic&#13;
regression techniques are used to test a recursive model linking the supply&#13;
and demand for piped water to selected household and community level&#13;
variables, and to examine their joint effect on child mortality.    Mortality is&#13;
measured with a standardized ratio proposed by Trussell and Preston (1982).&#13;
The analysis shows that increased maternal education accounted for a&#13;
larger share -- 34% -- of the mortality decline between 1970 and 1976 than any&#13;
other single factor, including access to piped water.       Increased access to&#13;
piped water did also contribute, accounting for about 20 percent of the&#13;
decline; moreover access to water helped to reduce the mortality differential&#13;
between lower and higher income and education classes. Obviously, piped water&#13;
is a costly intervention; an analysis of the relative cost-effectiveness of&#13;
various interventions -- e.g. pipe water vs. female education -- requires that&#13;
their costs be estimated and matched to these estimates of relative&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;

High mortality rates among infants and young children are a poignant&#13;
measure of the human cost of poverty and inequality in developing countries.&#13;
Though the transfer of advanced medical technology has contributed to declines&#13;
in the average level of mortality, income class differentials in early&#13;
childhood mortality rates have persisted and possibly widened (Behm, 1980).&#13;
For policy makers and agencies concerned the links between child mortality and&#13;
income inequality, a key question is how to design and implement health and&#13;
environmental programs that reduce mortality rates among the least privileged&#13;
groups. This paper examines the link between one such program, Brazil's urban&#13;
water project, and changes in early childhood mortality patterns in that&#13;
country during the early 1970s.1&#13;
The effectiveness of interventions for lowering mortality depends both on&#13;
the capacity of implementing agencies to supply the appropriate types of&#13;
services to low income families, and on those families, capacities to marshall&#13;
their limited resources in ways that they can utilize such services to improve&#13;
their children's chances of survival.      The theoretical implication of this&#13;
observation is, as Selowsky (1979) has pointed out, that there is a demand as&#13;
well as a supply side to the question.       "Demand" is understood not in the&#13;
sense that poor parents would choose between having more or fewer of their&#13;
children survive, but rather that the success of their efforts to raise&#13;
healthy children depends on the choices they make in allocating their limited&#13;
resources.&#13;
These points are illustrated by Brazilian experience over the last two&#13;
decades. Brazil has enjoyed sustained growth in aggregated output per capita,&#13;
but has been plagued by persistent inequality in,the distribution of personal&#13;
and family income, as well as by large interregional differentials in income&#13;
(Pfeffermann   and  Webb,   1979;  Knight   and  Moran,   1981;  Lluch,   1981).&#13;
.1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Significant differentials in mortality also have been observed among regions&#13;
and income classes, particularly for infants and children (Carvalho and&#13;
Sawyer, 1971; Carvalho.and Wood, 1978; Brazil, Fundacao IBGE, 1981).      Infant&#13;
mortality rates observed in a number of Brazil's larger cities increased from&#13;
the late 1960s to the early 1970s, leading some observers to hypothesize that&#13;
it was the effect of declining living standards among lower income groups&#13;
*(Yunes and Ronachezel, 1974; Wood, 1977).2&#13;
The Brazilian experience is signficant also in that during the 1970s it&#13;
embarked on an intensive effort to improve urban environmental conditions with&#13;
a known   link to mortality:     water supply   and sanitation.     PLANASA,  the&#13;
national water and sanitation program, provided public subsidies designed to&#13;
supply 80 percent of urban households with piped water and sewer connections&#13;
by  1980   (Almeida,  1977).     Another  consideration   is  that  Brazil  made&#13;
substantial progress in raising the level of educational attainment during the&#13;
1960s, including that of women, which is significant in that women educated in&#13;
the 1960s became mothers in the 1970s, and because maternal education is an&#13;
important determinant of the survival chances of infants and young children&#13;
(Behm,  1980;  Caldwell,  1980).   These  developments raise the question of&#13;
whether interclass differentials in infant and child mortality were-affected&#13;
by such measures, and of how their effectiveness in reducing mortality may&#13;
have been conditioned by continued income inequality.&#13;
This study utilizes data from the one-percent sample of Brazil's 1970&#13;
population census (Brazil,, Fundacao IBGE, 1979) and from the 1976 national&#13;
household survey .(PNAD, Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios:    Brazil,&#13;
Fundacao IBGE, 1982) to measure interclass differentials in child mortality in&#13;
urban  Brazil   and  to   analyze   the  relation   between  changes   in  these&#13;
* differentials and improved access to piped water, increased educational&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
attairment of mothers, and other household characteristics.      The analysis is&#13;
based on subsamples extracted from both files of a study population consisting&#13;
of currently married (with husbands present) urban women between the ages of&#13;
20 and 29 who had at least one live birth.        In addition to data on these&#13;
women's   births,  survival   of  their  children,   and  their  education,   the&#13;
subsamples include information on their husbands and on the households in&#13;
which they resided.    One reason for selecting this particular sample is that&#13;
the PLANASA program was an urban project.3 Another relates to timing. Access&#13;
to water was observed at the time of the interview, while data on the survival&#13;
of children relate to a period of years before the interview. Focusing on the&#13;
experience of women in their 20s reduces the time differential between the two&#13;
variables (which increases with the interviewee's age), though it does not&#13;
eliminate the timing problem.&#13;
Trends and Differentials in Child Mortality&#13;
Most of the available evidence on trends and differentials in child&#13;
mortality in Brazil consists of indirect measures derived from survival ratios&#13;
in the censuses and PNAD surveys.4     Table 1 presents estimates of trends and&#13;
regional differentials in infant mortality reported in the National Academy&#13;
Committee's preliminary report on-Brazil (NAS, 1983). The table also presents&#13;
rates based on advanced tabulations of the 1980 census, which became available&#13;
after the NAS estimates were prepared.     The date of the census or sample on&#13;
which the estimates are based is shown in the table, though it should be&#13;
remembered that the date to which the estimates refer is approximately three&#13;
years prior to the date of the interview.        At the national level, infant&#13;
mortality declined from 152 infant deaths per 1000 live births in 1950 to 107&#13;
in 1970, a decrease of 29 percent.     The decline was greater during the 1950s&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(19 percent) than the 1960s (13 percent).    Regional differentials (using the&#13;
percentage difference between infant mortality rates in the Northeast and Sao&#13;
Paulo as a rough index of such differentials) increased from 54 percent in&#13;
1950 to nearly 100 percent in 1960, then dropped to 70 percent in 1970.&#13;
After 1970 the pace of the national decline accelerated again, with the&#13;
rate falling by 20 percent between 1970 and 1980.     The 1972, 1973, and 1976&#13;
PNAD surveys and the 1974-75 ENDEF study present conflicting stories about&#13;
what may have been occurring during the decade.     The PNAD surveys suggest an&#13;
acceleration of mortality delcine during the first half of the decade, with a&#13;
slowdown after 1976.     The ENDEF results suggest that very little decline&#13;
occurred during the early 1970s, though caution is required in using 1970&#13;
census data as a basis of comparison with ENDEF because of the nature of that&#13;
survey.5   Comparison of PNAD results with preliminary 1980 census figures&#13;
suggests either that PNADs may have overstated the decline in the early 1970s&#13;
or that conditions leading to accelerated decline in the first half of the&#13;
decade may have changed for the worse in the second half.&#13;
Income Class Differentials in Mortality&#13;
Income class differentials are another important feature of Brazilian&#13;
mortality patterns. Carvalho and Wood (1978) found substantial differences in&#13;
life expectancy in their tabulations of 1970 data by household income level,&#13;
with a striking twenty-five year gap between the life expectancy of the lowest&#13;
income class in the Northeastern region and the highest income class in the&#13;
Southeast.   Published data from the 1976 PNAD survey include tabulations of&#13;
child survival ratios by minimum wage level, but tests of estimates derived&#13;
from these tabulations revealed problems of comparability with the categories&#13;
employed by Carvalho and Wood for.1970.     Since raw data files for both the&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1970 census and 'the 1976 PNAD survey were available, ratios were retabulated&#13;
using households income decile categories derived by Lluch (1981). The decile&#13;
categories were then clustered into three groups (deciles 1-3, 4-6, 7-10),&#13;
following a suggestion by Carvalho and Wood that possible bias arising from&#13;
interclass mobility in rates based on retrospective reporting can be reduced&#13;
by grouping the population into fewer and broader categories.6&#13;
Trussell's variant of the Brass model life table method of calculating&#13;
child mortality rates from questions on surviving children was used to derive&#13;
probabilities of dying between birth and ages two and three (2qo and 3q0) for&#13;
children born to women grouped according to their household income decile in&#13;
1970 and 1976, as shown in Table 2.7    Focusing on the average decrease in the&#13;
probability of dying between birth and ages two and three, the table shows an&#13;
overall decline of 26 percent from 1970 to 1976, which is greater than the 17&#13;
percent decline in the national level infant mortality rate reported in Table&#13;
1, and reflects the restrictions in the study population described above.&#13;
Declines were greater for higher income groups in both rural and urban areas,&#13;
but urban declines were greater for all groups than those in rural areas (the&#13;
upper income groups in rural areas were consolidated because of the limited&#13;
number of cases in the 7-10 category).      Timing may account for some of the&#13;
income class differentials.    Owing to later occurrence of births among women&#13;
in higher income groups, the reference date for the second mortality rate&#13;
recorded for them is more recent and would therefore capture more decline than&#13;
is recorded for lower income categories.       Even if the timing effect could&#13;
account for the apparent widening of interclass differentials, the data in&#13;
Table 2 raise doubts about the effectiveness of efforts to reduce mortality&#13;
differentials   durng  the  1970s.    These   data 'do  not  suggest  that  such&#13;
differentials narrowed.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Determinants of Mortality Differentials&#13;
Variables that influence infant and child mortality and that could&#13;
explain differentials among income groups include those with a potential&#13;
direct impact on the, survival chances of young children as well as those&#13;
relating to possible indirect effects associated with broader socioeconomic&#13;
characteristics of their mothers, their families, and the communities in which&#13;
they are reared.   Relevant causal variables include the nutritional level of&#13;
both mothers and children, the quality of their environment, and the maternal&#13;
and child health care to which they have access (Dyson, 1978; Antonovsky,&#13;
1980; Gwatkin et al., 1980; Loriaux, 1980). Background variables such as&#13;
income and education may influence mortality directly or by affecting or&#13;
conditioning directly causal variables.&#13;
Empirical   investigations  of  the   determinants  of  infant   and  child&#13;
mortality also have suggested that causal relationships are reinforcing rather&#13;
than distinct and separable.     Puffer and Serrano (1973) studied infant and&#13;
child mortality patterns in several Latin American cities, including three in&#13;
Brazil (Recife, Riberao Preto, and Sao Paulo).      Diarrheal diseases were the&#13;
leading causes of postneonatal deaths in all three cities, with the proportion&#13;
being  highest in the poorest of the three, Recife.         Their investigation&#13;
revealed a strong synergism between poor nutrition and environmental factors,&#13;
and concluded that children who were underweight at birth owing to poor&#13;
maternal nutrition and who were poorly nourished after birth were also more&#13;
susceptible to infections associated with unsafe water, poor sanitation, and&#13;
.8&#13;
inadequate housing.    Their study also showed that a high proportion of the&#13;
households reporting infant deaths lacked adequate water supply, though they&#13;
did not analyze systematically the relation between the two variables.&#13;
Access to internal piped water in the household is likely to be of most&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
direct benefit in lowering child mortality by reducing exposure to water-borne&#13;
diseases, particularly diarrheal disorders. Although evidence of the specific&#13;
links between water supply and such disorders is limited, the literature&#13;
suggests that increases in the amount of water used contributes to better&#13;
hygiene and the elimination of bacteriological contamination reduces the risk&#13;
of infection through intake.      Schneider,  Shiffman,  and Faigenblum (1978)&#13;
present clinical data from a Guateinalan study that document the loss of&#13;
nutrients during diarrheal episodes, and a recent World Bank study reports&#13;
that gastrointestinal diseases reduce absorption of nutrients by as much-as 30&#13;
percent  in acute cases    (World Bank,   1980).   An added dimension    in the&#13;
Brazilian situation relates to the very low iverage duration of breastfeeding&#13;
(Anderson, 1980).    Thus infants are exposed to the risk of infection from&#13;
contaminated water and through poor hygiene in prepared food at a very early&#13;
age.&#13;
This synergism extends to other socioeconomic variables, particularly&#13;
maternal education (Behm et al., 1978; Arriaga, 1980; Cochran et al., 1980).&#13;
Because the causal influences may be both direct and indirect, explanations of&#13;
the way in which maternal education affects mortality differentials vary.     In&#13;
interpreting Nigerian data, Caldwell (1979: 13-14) suggests three links: (1)&#13;
mothers with more. education tend to be less fatalistic about illness and&#13;
therefore prone to seek outside medical      assistance for an ill child; (2)&#13;
educated mothers are more likely to adopt improved child care practices such&#13;
as boiling water used in-the preparation of infant fornulas; and (3) education&#13;
may  change  intrafamily  family   relationships,  leading  to  a more   "child-&#13;
centered" orientation that would have a positive impact on children's health.&#13;
Schultz (1979), drawing on household production-theory, hypothesized that&#13;
more educated women earn more in the labor market and marry more educated men,&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and consequently have higher family income that would enable them to purchase&#13;
goods and services that improve child health.     Education could also increase&#13;
the effectiveness of women's non-market child care activities, though, as&#13;
Schultz cautions, the fact that market work requires women to be absent from&#13;
the home could have an offsetting negative impact on the quality of child&#13;
care.&#13;
Brazilian data illustrate the strong link between maternal education and&#13;
children's  survival  chances.    Table  3 shows   the proportion   dying  among&#13;
children of urban mother grouped by education.       Education categories range&#13;
from women with no formal education to those with ten or more years of&#13;
schooling as reported in the 1970 census and the 1976 PNAD survey.       Current&#13;
age of the mother is used as a control variable. There is a steady decline in&#13;
the proportion of children dying as educational     attainment increases.    The&#13;
most striking difference in mortality ratios, however, is the contrast between&#13;
mothers with   no formal   education  and other groups:      the rate of child&#13;
mortality among women with ten or more years of schooling is less than a&#13;
fourth of the rate for mothers with no education.&#13;
Comparing 1970 with 1976, there appears to have been improvement among&#13;
the upper three education groups, but the picture is less clear for the group&#13;
with no formal education.     There is a substantial decline in the relative&#13;
number of women with no formal education, and proportional increases in the&#13;
two highest classes, suggesting that between 1970 and 1976 shifts occurred&#13;
from the "none" group into the "1-4" category, as well as shifts from the&#13;
latter into the higher categories. These shifts are consistent with the fact&#13;
that a significantly increased proportion (41 percent) of women who were 20-24&#13;
years old in 1976 were in school as 14-18 year olds in 1970. The 1970 figure&#13;
is nearly double what was reported a decade earlier in 1960 (21 percent). The&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
last two columns of Table 3 are also of interest in that they show a decline&#13;
in the proportion of children. dying for mothers of all ages, which is&#13;
consistent with the improved survival probabilities shown in Table 2.&#13;
Specification of a Causal Model&#13;
The census and PNAD provide information on the education, the earnings&#13;
and employment status of household members, and on a number of household&#13;
characteristics, including access to piped water, thereby permitting a more&#13;
detailed examination of at least some aspects of the link between increased&#13;
access to piped water, recent social and economic changes in Brazil, and&#13;
trends and differentials in child mortality.     The measure of child mortality&#13;
analyzed below, CM(i), is based on the ratio of surviving children to births&#13;
for the mothers in the study population, and will be discussed in detail in&#13;
the next section.      For each mother,   a dummy variable, WAT(i),    indicates&#13;
whether the household in which she resided had access to piped water at the&#13;
time of the interview.&#13;
An adequate causal model of the links between improved access to piped&#13;
water and child mortality needs to take account of two sets of relation-&#13;
ships; One set pertains to variables associated with the consumption of this&#13;
particular service by urban households.       The other is concerned with the&#13;
impact that this consumption, along with other relevant variables, has on the&#13;
survival chances of children.      Empirical testing of such a model requires&#13;
specification of structural equations for both sets of relationships, as well&#13;
as the links between them.&#13;
Consumption has both a supply and a demand dimension. As Selowsky (1979)&#13;
has illustrated in his study of the consumption of services in Colombia, a&#13;
household may or may not consume a service such as water (1) because the&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
supply network is not geographically accessible or (2) because, in spite of&#13;
accessibility, that household chooses not to do so for reasons of price, an&#13;
income limitation, or as a matter of preference.        The former is a supply&#13;
constraint,  the latter demand.     A specification that accounts for supply&#13;
variables requires information on availability of water at a comparatively low&#13;
level of aggregation.     Selowsky worked with neighborhoods in his study of&#13;
Colombia.   The level of aggregation is much greater in the Brazilian data.&#13;
The  public  use  sample of the 1970 census      permitted  tabulations  for 117&#13;
geographical  areas that consisted of clusters of municipalities.        A water&#13;
supply variable, WS(j), was calculated as the proportion of households in each&#13;
of the 117 areas reported as having internal piped water in 1970.      Since the&#13;
117 areas were not identifiable in the PNAD survey, WS(j) was calculated at&#13;
the state level for 1976. A second variable, PWS(j), measuring the percentage&#13;
point increase in the number of households served in each state between 1970&#13;
and 1976, was added as a measure of the impact of the PLANASA program on the&#13;
supply of water.    Water supply was assumed to be exogenous at the level of&#13;
individual households, with the added restriction that the effect of supply on&#13;
mortality at the household level was indirect (via WAT).&#13;
Data limitations also hampered specification of demand variables. While&#13;
the data files included information on a number of household level variables&#13;
(e.g. income and education) that influence demand, no information was&#13;
available  at  any  level   of  aggregation  on  price  (hookup  and  use   fees)&#13;
differentials.   Further, those household level variables that determine the&#13;
demand  for water   are  also  likely  to have a causal     relation with child&#13;
mortality in their own right, and one (income) is endogenous at the household&#13;
level.   Since the study population consists of mothers, with husbands present&#13;
in single family households, and with only a small proportion (about 8&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
percent) of those women as working, the father's earnings, FY(i), is used as a&#13;
measure of the endogenous family income variable.         Education of fathers,&#13;
FED(i), and mothers, MED(i), are assumed to be exogenous at the household&#13;
level.   Identification of the state of residence in the two data files also&#13;
made  it possible to add state level      information from other sources:       a&#13;
variable measuring per capita value added taxes, TAX(j), in each state serves&#13;
as a proxy for regional differences in labor market conditi'ons.&#13;
The causal relations between mortality differentials, access to pipe&#13;
water, and the household and community level determinants of those variables&#13;
that this paper seeks to test can be summarized in the following set of&#13;
structural equations:&#13;
[1]  FY(i) = f[FED(i), TAX(j)]&#13;
[2] WAT(i) = w[MED(i), FED(i), FY(i), WS(j)]&#13;
[3] CM(i) = c[MED(i), FED(i), FY(i), WAT(i), TAX(i)]&#13;
Equation [1] specifies the first of the three endogenous variables in the&#13;
model, father's earnings (FY), in terms of his education, FED, and the value&#13;
added tax per capita in the state in which he resides, TAX.            While FED&#13;
reflects the influence of individual characteristics on earning, the value&#13;
added tax is as an argument in the earnings function because it reflects&#13;
regional differences in the productivity of manufacturing industry in Brazil&#13;
and their   impact on earnings.      The  second endogenous variable,    WAT,  is&#13;
represented in equation [2] as a function of household variables related to&#13;
demand for water (FED, MED, FY) as well as the community level water supply&#13;
variable, WS.   The variable measuring increases in water supply between 1970&#13;
and 1976, PWS(j) was added to the 1976 equation:&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
[2a] WAT = w[FED(i), MED(i), FY(i), WS(j), PWS(j)]&#13;
Finally, equation [3] represents child mortality, CM, as a function of&#13;
exogenous household variables (FED and MED), endogenous household variables&#13;
(FY and WAT), and the exogenous community level variable, TAX. The latter is&#13;
included in [3) because there is good reason to expect that the regional&#13;
differences in economic conditions that TAX measures not only affect CM&#13;
indirectly through FY and WAT, via equations [1] and [2], but also directly&#13;
through its effects on other aspects of the standard of. living in the&#13;
canmunity.&#13;
Since the arguments on the right hand side of equation [3] also appear in&#13;
equations [1) and [2], ordinary least squares regression will not yield&#13;
estimates of structural coefficients without further restrictions (Marsden,&#13;
1981: 118). Two such restrictions are invoked, one on the basis of reasoning&#13;
about the nature of the causal relations expressed in the system, and the&#13;
other based on an empirical check on the error terms in the estimating&#13;
equations.    The first restriction is that the model     is fully recursive in&#13;
terms of the relations among endogenous variables:       FY is causally prior to&#13;
WAT, and both causally prior to CM.      The alternative would be to argue that&#13;
there is a simultaneous relationship between the three variables, which does&#13;
not appear to be warranted in this case.     The second restriction is that the&#13;
error terms of the three estimating equations be uncorrelated with each other&#13;
and with the right hand side variables.       Empirical tests showing that this&#13;
restriction is justified will be reported below.&#13;
With these restrictions, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of the&#13;
reduced form coefficients of the exogenous variables can be used to estimate&#13;
their total effect on CM, and path analytical techniques can be utilized to&#13;
decompose their total effect into direct effects on CM and their indirect&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
effects via FY and WAT, as well as the total and direct effects of the latter&#13;
(Land, 1973; Alwin and Hauser, 1975).9&#13;
Measurement of the Dependent Variable&#13;
Several methodological problems arise in the use, of ratios of children&#13;
surviving to children ever born in analyses of differences in mortality at the&#13;
level of individual mothers. Indirect measurement techniques that are used to&#13;
translate survival ratios into mortality rate for groups of women cannot be&#13;
used to assign a mortality rate to an individual        woman.   Differences in&#13;
survival  ratios  among individual   mothers reflect not only the particular&#13;
mortality regime to which their children are subject, but also differences in&#13;
these children's exposure to the risk of dying, which is related to the number&#13;
and timing of the births that the woman has had.   This, in turn, is related to&#13;
her age and to the duration of her marriage or other type of union. Finally,&#13;
the relation of survivors to births is binomially rather than normally&#13;
distributed, making OLS an inappropriate estimating technique unless the&#13;
relation can somehow be normalized.&#13;
Trussell and Preston (1982) have suggested a method for standardizing&#13;
survival ratios in individual level data that (1) controls for duration of&#13;
risk and   (2) normalizes the distribution of these ratios.        Their method&#13;
employs a model schedule of survival ratios for women in different marital&#13;
duration (or age) categories.    Observed survival ratios are then divided by&#13;
the ratio that is expected given the woman's age or marital duration and the&#13;
appropriate   model  schedule,   which  yields   an  index   that  relates   the&#13;
individual's experience to the standard.10 The authors have demonstrated that&#13;
this index can be used in multiple regression analysis of individual level&#13;
data on child survivorship. Nonetheless, tradeoffs are involved in using OLS&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
rather than estimating techniques that take account of the fact that the&#13;
distribution of the index is bounded by zero.-&#13;
Table 4 illustrates how the index of observed/expected deaths can be used&#13;
to measure differences in the child mortality ratio, CM, by educational&#13;
attainment and income for various types of water supply.     In the table, CM is&#13;
cross-tabulated by categories of mothers' years of schooling, MED, as well as&#13;
by the husband's income decile and the various types of water to which&#13;
households in the sample had access, including internal piped water, the water&#13;
variable used in the analysis.     The first column for each of the two dates&#13;
shows CM for women in households with internal piped water, followed by&#13;
columns for women in households with water from various external sources.&#13;
Differentials  in CM   relate both to water access and to education.          For&#13;
example, among women in households with piped water, the index for women in&#13;
the "10+" educational attainment category is less than a third of that for&#13;
women in the "none" group.    For women in households with water, from external&#13;
sources, the educational differential is less, but stil substantial. For all&#13;
education groups, women with access to internal piped water, CM is 0.58&#13;
compared to 0.95 for those whose water was carried from a city tap or spring,&#13;
and 1.24 for those reporting "other" sources.&#13;
Within education classes, the percentage differential between those with&#13;
internal piped water and external sources increases with the level of&#13;
education, indicating a possible interaction among the effects of the two&#13;
variables.   The possibility of an interaction suggests that the specification&#13;
of equation [3] be modified to test for interactions:&#13;
[3a] CM = c[MED(i), FED(i), TAX(j), FY(i), WAT(i), D(i)]&#13;
where D(i) = MED(i) * WAT(i).&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Between 1970 and 1976, the proportion of women with no education declined&#13;
from 35 percent to 12 percent-of the sample population, which consists of&#13;
women aged 20-29 rather than women aged 20-49 as reported in Table 3.        The&#13;
proportion of women with 10 and more years of schooling increased from 5 to 16&#13;
percent.    The proportion   of households   with piped' water   also  increased&#13;
sharply, from 37 percent to 65 percent. The pattern of differentials in child&#13;
mortality by education and access to water'also changed: while the ration of&#13;
CM for the "10+" group to that of the "none" category fell by about 10 percent&#13;
for women in households with internal piped water, it increased for women&#13;
whose water came from other sources, suggesting that increased access to piped&#13;
water may have helped to offset a tendency for differentials in child&#13;
mortality associated with educational attainment to increase during the period&#13;
under study.&#13;
In the second panel of Table 4, differences in the child mortality ration&#13;
by income deciles are more pronounced in 1970 among hQuseholds that have&#13;
internal piped water than among those with outside sources of water supply.&#13;
In 1976, larger differentials between the lowest and highest income deciles&#13;
are observed among households with external sources.    This narrowing suggests&#13;
that income class differentials may have been reduced for households with&#13;
internal  piped water.    It also reflects a change in the distribution of&#13;
households relying on outside sources, reflecting a substantial decline in the&#13;
percent of household with well-spring and other external sources.      There may&#13;
be interaction between income and water supply and/or a change in the nature&#13;
of the relation between income and' child mortality, suggesting a test for&#13;
income class/water supply interaction along the lines suggested above for&#13;
water and education.&#13;
For all groups, the decline in child mortality is greatest for women in&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
households with internal piped water, while there is practically no change for&#13;
women in the "other" sources category and intermediate rates of decline in the&#13;
groups with water from city taps and springs.    Variability in child mortality&#13;
among households without internal piped water is of interest because city taps&#13;
and springs represent an intermediate (and less expensive) means of improving&#13;
access to water. However, since the main effort in the PLANASA program was to&#13;
increase access to internal piped water, and since most of the increased water&#13;
access during the period under study occurred in that category, the analysis&#13;
focuses on the contribution of that type of water access to differentials and&#13;
changes in CM beween 1970 and 1976.&#13;
Analysis of Differences in CM in 1970 and 1976&#13;
This section presents OLS estimates of the parameters in the causal model&#13;
of determinants of child mortality presented in equations [1) to [3) using a&#13;
path analytic- approach.   Given the recursive structure of the causal model,&#13;
the analysis begins by estimating the reduced forms (including exogenous&#13;
variables only) of equations for the three endogenous variables, and then&#13;
proceeds to estimation of the structural equations in steps in which each of&#13;
the causally prior endogenous variables is added to the regression equation of&#13;
the final dependent variable, CM.   The total, direct, and indirect effects of&#13;
each   variable  on  CM   are  then  measured   using  standardized   regression&#13;
coefficients and conventional decomposition techniques (see Alwin and Hauser,&#13;
1975).   A check on correlations among the error terms provides a test of the&#13;
validity of the recursive specification.&#13;
Table 5 states the units in which the variables used in the regressions&#13;
are measured, and provides sample means and standard deviations.       Following&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the suggestion of Trussell and Preston, observations are weighted by the&#13;
number of children ever born in order to make the results representative of&#13;
births rather than women. There is generally greater variability (as measured&#13;
by the ratio of standard deviations to means) in the 1970 sample than in 1976,&#13;
suggesting either increasing homogeneity in the population with respect to&#13;
these variables between 1970 and 1976, or that the 1976 sample may be&#13;
underrepresenting socioeconomic groups at the extremes of the range.          An&#13;
appendix table presents zero order correlation coefficients between each&#13;
variable for both dates.    The high intercorrelation between MED and FED (0.6&#13;
to 0.7) reflects the tendency for the educated to seek mates with similar&#13;
levels of education.&#13;
Regression results are presented in Tables 6 (for 1970) and 7 (for 1976),&#13;
with both following the sequence just described:      columns (1), (2), and (4)&#13;
are the reduced forms of equations [1], [2], and [3] of the causal model,&#13;
while columns (3) and (6) are OLS estimates of structural equations [2] and&#13;
[3] (there are no causally prior endogenous variables in equation [1] for&#13;
fathers' earnings). Column (5) includes the endogenous variable, FY, which is&#13;
causally prior to WAT but omits WAT itself as a step in estimating indirect&#13;
effects:&#13;
To avoid repetition, the results in Tables 6 and 7 will not be described&#13;
in detail since most of the conclusions that can be drawn from them are&#13;
revealed when effects are decomposed.    It is worth noting that addition of FY&#13;
to the WAT regression had a greater effect in 1976 than in 1970, while the&#13;
reverse occurred with the addition of FY to the CM equation. In fact, the FY&#13;
coefficient was not statistically significant in 1976, suggesting a change in&#13;
nature  of  the  causal   linkage  between  these  FY, WAT   and  CM.    Another&#13;
observation is that the coefficient for WS in the CM equations was not&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
significant for either date, which is consistant with the point made earlier&#13;
that the supply effect may be more indirect than direct.       A final point is&#13;
that analysis of error terms revealed no major problems with the recursive&#13;
specification. Details are reported in a footnote.12&#13;
Path Analysis: Total, Direct, and Indirect Effects&#13;
Decomposition of effects using standardized regression coefficients is&#13;
useful first in revealing both the level and, since we have estimates for two&#13;
points in time, changes in the relative contributions of variables to&#13;
differences in child mortality, and second in providing a measure of the&#13;
extent to which the effects of exogenous variables have been mediated by&#13;
intervening endogenous   variables.   This is particularly appropriate for a&#13;
study, which, in addition to seeking to determine the effect of access to pipe&#13;
water on child mortality, also tries to clarify the roles that both supply and&#13;
demand variables affecting that access play in the relationship between water&#13;
and child mortality.&#13;
Table 8 presents the decomposition of the effects on child mortality of&#13;
variables in the regressions in Tables 6 and 7.     Total effects are shown in&#13;
the  first  column.    For the exogenous    variables,  total  effects  are the&#13;
standardized coefficients from the reduced form regressions (column 4 in&#13;
Tables 6-7). For the endogenous variables, they are the coefficients from the&#13;
first equation in which the variable enters (column 5 in Tables 6-7 for FY and&#13;
column 6 of Tables 6-7).     In the case of WAT, the total effect equals the&#13;
direct effect since that variable is the last in terms of causal ordering in&#13;
the model.   Indirect effects are shown in columns 2 (for FY) and 3 (for WAT),&#13;
and were derived using the technique described by Alwin and Hauser.&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
What does Table 8 tell us about:       (a) the comparative importance of&#13;
exogenous household and community level variables on differences in child&#13;
mortality; (b) the extent to which their effect is direct, or mediated through&#13;
endogenous household variables, WAT in particular; (c) the degree to which the&#13;
mediation of WAT is influenced more strongly by household or community&#13;
variables; and (d) changes, if any, in these relationships between 1970 and&#13;
1976?   In considering (c) it is important to recall the dual roles that were&#13;
assigned to the exogenous variables in the causal model that is being&#13;
analyzed. They have a direct causal relation to child mortality, and indirect&#13;
effects via FY and WAT, which have been specified as supply side effects on&#13;
WAT for the community level variables and demand side effects for the&#13;
household variables.&#13;
Mothers' and fathers' education, which are exogenous household level&#13;
variables, have the largest total effect on child mortality in both 1970 and&#13;
1976. Most of the effect of MED is direct (the ratio of the direct effect to&#13;
the total effect is .85 in both instances).       The ratio of direct to total&#13;
effect for FED is somewhat lower (.73) in 1970, but increases in 1976 ( to&#13;
.84)  at the   same  time that its total    effect increases.     The exogenous&#13;
community level variables, TAX and WS, have a lower but still significant&#13;
total effect on child mortality .      They differ in the way in which their&#13;
effects are mediated, since a larger share of the effect of TAX is direct,&#13;
while less than half of the effect of WS is direct.       In fact, the indirect&#13;
effect of TAX via WAT is positive in sign, indicating that once demand is&#13;
controlled there is a lower level of individual household access to piped&#13;
water in areas with higher taxes per capita. Possible adverse effects of this&#13;
on CM appear to be offset by other unspecified community level influences&#13;
reflected in the negative direct effect of TAX.     In the case of WS, a large&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
share of its effect is mediated by WAT both in 1970 and in 1976, which is to&#13;
be expected since it was introduced to measure the supply side impact of water&#13;
availability at the community level on access at the household level.       When&#13;
community level increase in water supply (PWS) is introduced in 1976, a higher&#13;
proportion of its effect is direct.&#13;
The total effects of the endogenous household level variables, FY and&#13;
WAT, differ in comparative importance vis-a-vis the other two sets of&#13;
variables.   The total effect of WAT is greater than for either of the two&#13;
community level exogenous variables, but less than MED and FED. The effect of&#13;
WAT increases from 1970 to 1976.    FY's total effect is about the same as the&#13;
community level variables in 1970 and slips well below them (and is, in fact,&#13;
insignificant) in 1976.&#13;
In sum, the main changes from 1970 to 1976 are as follows: (1) The total&#13;
effect of FED increases, as does the direct component of its effect; at the&#13;
same time, the total effect of FY drops, while the indirect component of its&#13;
effect (via WAT) increases.    (2) The total effect of water supply variables,&#13;
WS in 1970 and WS plus PWS in 1976, increases, with most of the effect of that&#13;
increase being mediated by WAT, the household level water variable.         This&#13;
increase in the indirect effect of exogenous supply via WAT suggests (3) that&#13;
supply played a greater role in 1976 than in 1970, which is what one would&#13;
expect the outcome of a successful public sector intervention to be.&#13;
Interestingly, the total effect of the other community level exogenous&#13;
variable, TAX, also increases, but none of that increase was mediated by the&#13;
endogenous household level variables.    As noted above, the indirect effect of&#13;
TAX via WAT worked in the opposite direction, more so in 1976 than in 1970,&#13;
which, given its interpretation as an indication that households in high TAX&#13;
areas had lower access to WAT, also lends support to the conclusion that the&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
importance of water supply at the community level increased from 1970 to 1976.&#13;
Test for Interaction&#13;
An additional issue that is raised in relation to the causal model&#13;
specified in equations [1] - [3) was interaction:      the extent to which the&#13;
effect of access to piped water on child mortality may have been greater or&#13;
less for women within different education classes or in households with higher&#13;
or lower income    levels.    The question of interactions     is of particular&#13;
interest because it would be useful to know whether a public sector&#13;
intervention such as increased water supply has a redistributive effect on a&#13;
sensitive measure of welfare, thereby compensating for some of the adverse&#13;
effects of inequality in the distribution of human resources and income on the&#13;
demand side.&#13;
As  suggested   earlier,  equation   [3)  can  be  modified   to  test  for&#13;
interactions by adding interaction terms. Two such terms have been tested in&#13;
both the 1970 and 1976 data, one for WAT and MED and the other for WAT and&#13;
FY.   If interaction is operating in the compensatory manner described above,&#13;
then one would expect that differences in CM by MED and FY would be less in&#13;
households with access to piped water than those without it, which would show&#13;
up in the regressions in the form of flatter slopes for the MED and FY&#13;
regresson lines when WAT is present.    Thus we would expect positive signs for&#13;
both interaction terms.&#13;
Table 9 summarizes the tests for interaction.        The first and fourth&#13;
columns show the 1970 and 1976 regression results for equation [3) as reported&#13;
in Tables 6 and 7.   The next two columns show the results when an interaction&#13;
term is added, first for MED and then for FY.       While the signs of all four&#13;
interaction terms are positive, as expected, only the last (WAT and FY in&#13;
21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1976) is statistically significant (according to the "t" test, the probability&#13;
that its coefficient is, in fact,      zero is less than .02).       This result&#13;
suggests that while the slope of the overall FY regression line was zero in&#13;
1976, the slope for non-WAT households was negative, so that WAT did indeed&#13;
contribute to a narrowing of income related differences in child mortality in&#13;
1976.&#13;
Decomposition of Changes in CM from 1970 to 1976&#13;
A final question relates to the relative contribution of increased access&#13;
to piped water to the 27 percent decline in child mortality between 1970 and&#13;
1976.   Both the 1970 and 1976 regression equations can be evaluated usng&#13;
sample means for both dates to show the contribution of changes in those means&#13;
to the change in the predicted value of child mortality between the two&#13;
dates.   This has been done in Table 10.     To simplify the discussion of the&#13;
role of water, regressions were rerun without the exogenous community supply&#13;
measures, so that only WAT appears in the regression coefficients shown in the&#13;
first column of the table.     The second and third rows are the products of&#13;
these coefficients and the sample means of variables in 1970 and 1976,&#13;
respectively.    Column four shows the differences between columns two and&#13;
three, which sum to the total change in CM.     Column five expresses the ratio&#13;
of the change contributed by each variable as a percent of the total change in&#13;
CM.&#13;
Changes in the mean values of exogenous household characteristics account&#13;
for the largest share of the total decline in child mortality .        With 1970&#13;
regression coefficients, MED and FED account for 54 percent of the decline.&#13;
FY, an endogenous household variable, accounts for another 18 percent.       With&#13;
1976 coefficients, FY's contribution disappears (it shows up as a positive&#13;
22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
value,   though  it   is   statistically  insignificant),   and   the  combined&#13;
contributions of MED and FED are 65 percent.    Increased access to piped water&#13;
plays a secondary but still significant role, contributing 18.7 percent to the&#13;
decline using 1970 coefficients, and 22.3 percent with the 1976 results.&#13;
While the 3.6 percentage point increase in the contribution of water to the&#13;
decline in child mortality with 1976 coefficients does not signal a major&#13;
structural change, the direction of the change lends further support to the&#13;
view that the water program contributed to the amelioration of differences in&#13;
child mortality that might have otherwise persisted owing to inequality in the&#13;
distribution of income and human resources at' the household level.&#13;
Summary and Conclusions&#13;
The objective of this paper has been to analyze the determinants of&#13;
trends and differentials in early childhood mortality in urban Brazil during&#13;
the 1970s.  The mortality measure used in the study was the ratio, CM, of the&#13;
actual proportion of children surviving for women in the study population to&#13;
the proportion that would be expected to survive given a standard mortality&#13;
schedule, those women's current age, and the ages at which they began to have&#13;
children.   The study population consisted of samples of currently married&#13;
urban mothers extracted from the Brazil's 1970 population census and its 1976&#13;
national samply survey (PNAD).&#13;
Particular attention was focused on the contribution of increased access&#13;
to piped water in reducing both the level of child mortality and differences&#13;
between socioeconomic groups during the period covered by the two data&#13;
sources.    In assessing   this contribution,   the paper attempted    first to&#13;
determine the relative importance of household and community level variables&#13;
as determinants of differences in child mortality, and second to identify the&#13;
23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
dual  roles  that the   two  sets  of variables   played.    In the underlying&#13;
conceptual model, both household and community variables relate directly to&#13;
child mortality as determinants in their own right as well as indirectly&#13;
through variables that are endogenous at the household level, water being the&#13;
case in point, either as demand variables (at the household level) or supply&#13;
variables (at the community level).     A recursive model consisting of three&#13;
equations was estimated, and the results used to assess the contribution of&#13;
increases in access to piped water in urban Brazil to declines in the level of&#13;
child mortality by means of path analysis.&#13;
The main conclusions are as follows:&#13;
(1) That exogenous household variables (educaton of mothers and fathers)&#13;
had the greatest total effect on differences in child mortality and that&#13;
most of this effect was direct.&#13;
(2) That access to piped water had a significant but secondary impact on&#13;
differences in child mortality, accounting for about one-fifth of such&#13;
differences.&#13;
(3) That community level variables played a minor, but still significant&#13;
role in child mortality differentials, with most of the effect being&#13;
indirect via the household water access variable (WAT), which was&#13;
expected since they entered the model via the water supply equation in&#13;
the specification.&#13;
Examination of changes from 1970 to 1976 indicated that most of the&#13;
decline in child mortality could be accounted for in terms of changes in the&#13;
composition of the study population rather than changes in the parameters of&#13;
24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the causal model, with increased education of both mothers and fathers playing&#13;
a prime role, and increased access to piped water a secondary role.         Some&#13;
changes were observed in the parameter estimates, ones consistent with the&#13;
expectation that increased water supply could contribute to attenuation of&#13;
differentials in child mortality associated with education and income.      The&#13;
relative weight of supply variables in the decomposition of child mortality&#13;
differentials increased form 1970 to 1976, though most of this increase&#13;
continued to be indirect, via WAT, the household level water access&#13;
variable. Interaction terms were introduced as a test of the strength of this&#13;
attenuation effect, and indicated that in 1976 the effect of water was&#13;
somewhat greater among lower income groups.&#13;
The ameliorating effect of increased access to piped water on income&#13;
class differentials in early childhood mortality was thus significant but&#13;
limited in comparison with other household level characteristics, particularly&#13;
education.    This does not imply    that community   level  interventions were&#13;
ineffective; though the level of education was specified as exogenous at the&#13;
household level in this study, it was also the product of community level&#13;
action.   The main difference is that most of the interventions that affected&#13;
child mortality through educational attainment were made earlier than those&#13;
operating via increased access to water.     Increased education had a greater&#13;
impact, but it also took longer.&#13;

Birdsall, T. Paul Schultz, and participants in a World Bank sponsored workshop&#13;
on the project held in Washington in May, 1982 provided valuable comments on&#13;
an earlier version of the paper.&#13;
2.    Though  some  of the  "increase"   in infant mortality rates could have&#13;
resulted   from   improved   reporting,   the   trends   were   associated   with&#13;
deteriorating conditions of housing and sanitation in the rapidly growing&#13;
peripheral areas of larger cities (Lesser, 1974; Monteiro, 1982), and with&#13;
poor nutrition resulting from inflationary pressures on the limited purchasing&#13;
capacity of low income families (Iunes et al., 1975).        Data from the 1975&#13;
Estudo Nacional   de Despesa Familiar    (ECNDEFT revealed  that 37 percent of&#13;
children under the age of 18 suffered from first-degree malnutrition, i.e. 76-&#13;
90 percent of nonmal weight for age (Knight and Moran, 1981:27-28).&#13;
3. The analysis is limited to the effectiveness of water projects even though&#13;
the PLANASA program included both water and sanitation, because preliminary&#13;
analysis   indicated  that  in   urban  areas  (where   the  program  was   being&#13;
implemented) almost all households that had piped water also had a link to the&#13;
city sanitation system, or to another "modern" sanitation system (e.g., septic&#13;
tanks).  Most of the cells required for testing their separate effects (water&#13;
but no sanitation,    or  vice-versa)  were  empty.   Care should be taken in&#13;
interpreting the results of this study to avoid any implication that the&#13;
contribution of safe water to increased child survival is more or less than&#13;
improved sanitation, since that trade-off was not tested.&#13;
4.  Brazil's national system of vital statistics was established in 1974, and&#13;
data for the municipalities of state capitals are available for earlier&#13;
dates.   While vital   statistics for Sao Paulo and a few other states are&#13;
reasonably complete and consistent with estimates from the census, they still&#13;
fall short of the reliability and completeness of coverage needed for analysis&#13;
of national   trends and differentials    (Altmann and Ferreira 1979: 55).      A&#13;
thorough assessment of the available data on Brazilian fertility and mortality&#13;
during the period from 1950 to 1976 has been carried out by the U. S. National&#13;
Academy of Sciences (NAS), Committee on Population and Demography (NAS,&#13;
1979).   The report on Brazil provides indirect mortality estimates derived&#13;
from questions on children ever born and children surviving as reported in the&#13;
1950, 1960, and 1970 censuses and in PNAD surveys taken after 1970.&#13;
Trussell's variant of the Brass model life table approach was used to generate&#13;
indirect estimates (NAS, 1981) for Brazil as a whole and for each of the seven&#13;
PNAD sampling regions (See Figure 1). The rural areas of frontier states (the&#13;
North and Central-West macroregions, which accounted for about 5 percent of&#13;
Brazil's population in 1970) were not included in the PNAD samples and are&#13;
excluded from the NAS estimates.    Preliminary results of the 1980 census have&#13;
since been released, and it was also possible to calculate a national level&#13;
estimate of the infant mortality rate from 1980 data.&#13;
26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.  A puzzling feature of the estimates derived from surveys during the 1970s&#13;
is the divergence of rates for 1974-75 from those for 1972, 1973, and 1976.&#13;
The 1974-75 estimates were calculated from special tabulations of the special&#13;
nutrition survey (ENDEF) conducted in those years.      While the ENDEF results&#13;
suggest a pattern of regional differentials that is similar to the ones in&#13;
census and PNAD data, the level of infant mortality is significantly higher&#13;
than in adjacent PNAD surveys.     When ENDEF results are compared to the 1970&#13;
census, it appears that there was no decline at the national level, and that&#13;
the  Northeast/Sao  Paulo   differential  increased  even  more  than   the PNAD&#13;
indicates.   The ENDEF results need to be viewed with caution, especially in&#13;
comparison with estimates from the census and PNAD surveys.     No assessment of&#13;
the comparability of ENDEF to census and PNAD data is available.     It is quite&#13;
possible that ENDEF is closer to the Brazilian reality in terms of the level&#13;
of mortality than tfh census or PNADs.       However, this does not imply that&#13;
mortality levels were constant after 1970; rather, it suggests that both the&#13;
census and the PNADs may have understated the true level of mortality and that&#13;
the decline occurred from a higher base.&#13;
6.   Household income was calculated by adding up the monetary earnings of&#13;
family members (after imputing earnings to members whose earnings were&#13;
reported as unknown--see Fox 1981). The 1976 survey included several types of&#13;
income not explicitly covered in the 1970 census.      To insure comparability,&#13;
1970 concepts have been applied in both instances.       Boarders and household&#13;
employees were excluded, while other related individuals are included, so that&#13;
"household" income measures extended family income.&#13;
7.   Estimates are included for both urban and rural women, though the latter&#13;
are excluded from further analysis.     Also excluded are women not related to&#13;
the head of the household in which they resided, a step taken to eliminate&#13;
bias arising from the inclusion of live-in domestic servants in a substantial&#13;
proportion of middle and upper income Brazilian households.&#13;
8.   Data on the relation between child mortality, nutrition, and access to&#13;
health care in Brazil are limited to local area studies such as the ones&#13;
reported by Puffer and Serrano.       The one exception is the 1974-75 ENDEF&#13;
survey; however, the results of that survey are available only in the form of&#13;
published summary tables for large regional aggregates, and the tabulations&#13;
that have been published to not include any that link survival rates to&#13;
nutrition levels or other aspects of household consumption that were included&#13;
in the scope of the survey. Since a pubic use file of ENDEF data has not been&#13;
released, special tabulations were limited to variables included in the 1970&#13;
census and 1976 PNAD survey, which are quite limited in comparison with ENDEF.&#13;
9.  Two additional problems remain with the use of OLS with these equations.&#13;
One relates to measurement of the dependent variables, which as measured has&#13;
statistical properties that make OLS an inappropriate estimating technique. A&#13;
transformation of CM that yields the desired properties is discussed in the&#13;
next section.   The second concerns equation [2], whose dependent variables is&#13;
WAT, a dummy variable taking values of zero and one depending on whether a&#13;
household has water or not.    With a dummy dependent variable, OLS can lead to&#13;
predictions of values less than zero and greater than one, in addition to&#13;
yielding inefficient estimates, so that logistic maximum-likelihood estimating&#13;
techniques are preferred.    However, the error term restriction described in&#13;
the previous paragraph becomes much more complex when OLS is not used;&#13;
27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
further, OLS is least likely to manifest these properties when the sample mean&#13;
of the variable to be estimated falls between 0.3 and 0.7, which is the case&#13;
with these data (Amemiya,    1981:1488).   Therefore the decision was made to&#13;
estimate equation [2] with OLS.&#13;
10.   The life table values reported in the table were derived from child&#13;
survival ratios in the census and PAND data, which were adjusted using&#13;
multipliers based on ratios of parity at ages 15-19 to parity at ages 20-24.&#13;
Owing to the limited number of births to higher income women at these ages,&#13;
the parity ratios could be distorting the adjustment.     The observed survival&#13;
ratios and parity ratios are as follows:&#13;
Tncome                 PI/P2     Survival         PI/P2     Survival&#13;
Deciles                1970        Rate           1976         Rate&#13;
1 - 3                .087        .86            .109        .88&#13;
4 - 6                .129        .86             .142       .89&#13;
7 - 9                .157        .88            .147       .93&#13;
10                  .118        .93            .076       .97&#13;
The survival ratios suggest that the widening differential between the upper&#13;
and lower groups does not derive from distortions in the adjustment factors,&#13;
though the pattern of average parity differentials does suggest caution about&#13;
the appropriateness of the assumptions of indirect measurement of life table&#13;
values when populations are classified by income.&#13;
11.  Two assumptions required for application of the Trussell-Preston method&#13;
are violated by the Brazilian data. These relate to geographic and interclass&#13;
mobility within the study population and to changes in mortality levels in the&#13;
years prior to the time that retrospective questions are asked.        Since the&#13;
index is based on the cumlative experience of women's births and surviving&#13;
children, the mortality level observed at a particular point in time will not&#13;
be representative of women in a particular reference group (for example, and&#13;
income class) if there has recently been significant movement of women between&#13;
classes, or if mortality rates have been declining rapidly. One way to reduce&#13;
the time bias is to restrict the analysis to women in their twenties, whose&#13;
experience is more recent.    Table 2 suggested that the experience of younger&#13;
women reflected mortality rates 2-3 years before the 1970 census and 1976 PNAD&#13;
survey, whereas the time reference of rates for older women was 3-5 years. In&#13;
dealing with the mobility problem, Carvalho and Wood have suggested that&#13;
comparisons as well as the selection of standard schedules based on groups&#13;
that  are   broad  enough  to  minimize   mobility  effects.    Following   this&#13;
suggestion, separate standards were used in calculating the index depending on&#13;
whether women were members of families that were above or below the median&#13;
level of family income.&#13;
12.  Zero order correlations between error terms for the endogenous variables&#13;
are  as  follows.    Coefficients   are  shown  above  the  diagonal  and  their&#13;
significance (the likelihood that the correlation is random) below it.&#13;

In all but one instance the zero order correlations between the error terms&#13;
and exogenous   variables  are not significantly    different from zero.     The&#13;
exception is MED and the error term for FY, owing to the high correlation&#13;
between MED and FED.    MED is not included in the FY equation on the ground&#13;
that this correlation is more related to the selectivity of the marriage&#13;
process than to spouse contributions to earning capacity.&#13;

            The effect of piped water on early
            childhood mortality in urban Brazil, 1970-1976
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper utilizes data on the ratio of
            surviving children and other variables for a sub-sample of
            mothers aged 20-29 to analyze the impact of increased access
            to piped water in urban households on trends and income
            class differentials in child mortality. Path analytic
            regression techniques are used to test a recursive model
            linking the supply and demand for piped water to selected
            household and community level variables, and to examine
            their joint effect on child mortality. The analysis shows
            that increased maternal education accounted for a larger
            share of the mortality decline between 1970 and 1976 than
            any other single factor. Increased access to piped water did
            contribute, and also helped reduce the mortality
            differential between lower and higher income and education
            classes. Obviously, piped water is a costly intervention; an
            analysis of the relative cost-effectiveness, e.g. piped
            water vs. female education, requires that their costs be
            estimated and matched to these estimates of relative effectiveness.
