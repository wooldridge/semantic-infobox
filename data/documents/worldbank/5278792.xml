Increasingly small water and sanitation service providers, such as community-based organizations&#13;
&#13;
and private sector suppliers, are being acknowledged as important suppliers within the African&#13;
&#13;
water and sanitation sector. One of the important constraints faced by these providers is finance&#13;
&#13;
and access to credit. This paper discusses the development of the microfinance sector and services&#13;
&#13;
in sub-Saharan Africa and the potential demand for financial services by small water and sanitation&#13;
&#13;
service providers. The role of governments and development partners in facilitating the finance and&#13;
&#13;
credit for small providers is also discussed.&#13;

It is increasingly recognized that a vital role is      specifically    address    related   issues  and&#13;
played in the provision of water and sanitation         constraints (Bonn Conference on Freshwater&#13;
services in Sub-Saharan Africa by small service         2001a and 2001b). The recent report of the&#13;
providers (SSPs). These come in many forms,             Camdessus panel emphasized that "microcredit&#13;
including informal private sector suppliers,            schemes are also important in financing&#13;
community-based organizations (CBOs), and               community water projects and small local&#13;
households as self-providers. Recent studies            producers" (Camdessus 2003). In Sub-Saharan&#13;
suggest that their share in total services is high,     Africa, this will need to be assessed in the&#13;

poor in both rural and urban areas. For                 less developed, though greater outreach and&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The microfinance sector in Sub-Saharan Africa is                    Financial performance. In general MFIs in&#13;
still relatively young. The vast majority of MFIs                   Sub-Saharan       Africa     perform         poorly,&#13;
in the region are still in the start-up and/or                      especially compared to the MFIs in South&#13;
consolidation phase and are grappling with                          America and Asia, which perform better in&#13;
capacity,    outreach,     and      viability      issues.          terms of portfolio quality and operational&#13;
However, when viewed from a wider financial                         and financial sustainability. Comparative&#13;
systems perspective there are some exceptions,                      statistics from the best performing MFIs in&#13;
as the experience from Kenya illustrates. Based                     Africa clearly show that most have negative&#13;
on studies in selected countries in the region,1                    profit margins (measured as adjusted net&#13;
some key features are:                                              operating       income/operating          income).2&#13;
                                                                    Assessment of the financial performance of&#13;
     Market size and penetration. Microfinance                      other microfinance providers, such as the&#13;
     in    Sub-Saharan       Africa      lags     behind            cooperative sector in Kenya or the banking&#13;
     developments in Asia and Latin America.                        sector in Senegal, is not readily available.&#13;
     Though it has been estimated that there are&#13;
     over 1,000 providers/initiatives in the                        Products. The introduction of new products&#13;
     region, perhaps only 20 are on the way to                      is indicative of an awareness of the need to&#13;
     sustainability.    Market        penetration        is         respond to market demands to increase&#13;
     relatively low, estimated at 7 percent of all                  outreach and performance. There is little&#13;
     poor households in West Africa and at even                     product     diversification     in    Sub-Saharan&#13;
     lower levels in East and southern Africa                       Africa. In general the majority of MFIs only&#13;
     (ICC 2002; World Council of Credit Unions                      offer one credit product: loans for income-&#13;
     2000).   However,       Kenya       may      be    an          generating activity. MFIs in Asia and Latin&#13;
     exception, with the total member outreach                      America have developed a wider range of&#13;
     of all microfinance providers being about                      products,       which      include       consumer&#13;
     1.8 million, suggesting about 30 percent                       financing, housing loans, infrastructure&#13;
     penetration of the poor.                                       loans (including those offered for water and&#13;
                                                                    sanitation),3 and educational loans. While&#13;
     Outreach. Level of outreach in terms of                        some MFIs in Africa have started to&#13;
     clients served is significantly lower than in                  diversify their products the majority have&#13;

                Box 1: Market-Based Product Development for MFIs Supported by MicroSave-Africa&#13;
&#13;
  MicoSave-Africa is a project funded by CGAP, DFID, and UNDP. It promotes the development of savings and&#13;
  other client-responsive financial services among MFIs in 11 countries in East and Southern Africa. Its particular&#13;
  focus has been on savings mobilization, market research and product development for microfinance. Action&#13;
  research in different countries involves helping MFIs to listen better to clients and design appropriate financial&#13;
  products based on better market information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Market research essentially involves a better understanding of the environment and client needs, which results in&#13;
  improved marketing and promotion, refining or developing new products and improving delivery systems.&#13;
  Market research will need to be adapted to the nature and maturity of the MFI, and include both ongoing and&#13;
  periodic activities. Based on these results and through consultative brainstorming, the next step is to develop a&#13;
  product concept. This is converted to a prototype for pilot testing. MicroSave-Africa has developed tools to&#13;
  support MFIs for such market research and pilot testing.&#13;

    In areas where MFIs already have a                          mobilization, they face low credit-to-deposit&#13;

There is an increasing recognition of the role of              affordability. However, sustainable access to&#13;
small WSS service providers, especially in                     credit would enable an increase without any&#13;

              Box 4. Unmet Demand for Expansion and Augmentation in Two CBO Schemes in Kenya&#13;
&#13;
 Kabuku project. The Kabuku water project was first instituted through ministerial efforts by the Kenyan&#13;
 government in the 1970s. Poor design, together with insufficient funds, led to the collapse of the scheme in the late&#13;
 1980s. In 1990, a CBO was formed to rehabilitate and manage the rehabilitated scheme with initial funding from&#13;
 SIDA and a private company. Since then the scheme has been managed by the CBO independent of external&#13;
 support. Members, who own the CBO, elect a managing committee to ensure the efficient running of the scheme.&#13;
 Four technical staff are employed by the scheme in this effort. Revenues come primarily from user fees, which in&#13;
 turn are dependent upon the volume of water consumed by members. Kabuku has managed, since its&#13;
 rehabilitation, to collect sufficient revenues to meet its costs, and a major expansion, the construction of a storage&#13;
 tank, was financed through the use of the accumulated surplus generated from scheme revenues. However, efforts&#13;
 made by the CBO to raise additional funds to augment the total capacity for water production have not been&#13;
 successful, despite its healthy revenue base. The main constraint in this has been the inability of the CBO to offer&#13;
 acceptable collateral.&#13;
&#13;
 Gitaru self-help water project. The Gitaru self-help water project serves as an example of a successful community-&#13;
 run water supply project. The project was first developed in the 1970s when the area residents, without any donor&#13;
 or government aid, formed a self-help group. Today, the scheme delivers piped water to 600 households, as well as&#13;
 providing kiosk service to other households in the area. Extension of the service depends upon available capacity,&#13;
 and new users pay a connection fee and agree to adhere to the scheme's bylaws. The new user is also responsible&#13;
 for the installation of a water meter and the local pipes to his/her dwelling. The water is charged according to a&#13;
 rising block tariff. The scheme relies upon three boreholes, one of which is shared with a neighboring scheme, to&#13;
 meet the needs of its members. A private company provides the technical support for the boreholes and oversees&#13;
 water quality. Four full-time employees run the scheme, with an elected volunteer committee overseeing&#13;
 operations. The self-help group maintains a savings account at a local branch of the Kenya Commercial Bank,&#13;
 which used to also offer bill collection services. The main constraints facing the scheme are difficulties in financing&#13;
 large repairs, as collections are not sufficient to raise adequate surplus to meet these costs directly. The CBO&#13;
 therefore has to rely on informal finance routes, such as the use of harambee to finance major repairs and&#13;
 expansions. Funds generated in this manner can be unpredictable and irregular. In such circumstances the&#13;
 availability of credit finance could be of great benefit. Further, the scheme would benefit from renewed bill&#13;
 collection services offered by its banking outlet.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                               Box 5. Use of MFIs to Provide Financial Services for CBOs&#13;
&#13;
Ethiopia. As a part of the Rural Water Supply and Environment Project (RWSEP, funded by the government of&#13;
Finland) in Amhara Region in Ethiopia, effort has been made to involve the Amhara Credit and Savings Institute&#13;
(ASCI), the local microfinance institution, in providing financial services to the CBO. Interestingly, of the&#13;
community-based schemes supported through this project nearly 60 percent (727 schemes) collect user fees and&#13;
about 65 percent (472 schemes) of these use the services of ASCI to deposit the fees collected. This uptake was aided&#13;
by `letters of comfort' from the program during the initial stages and some capacity-building support. Greater&#13;
familiarity with the process means these measures are no longer needed. Regular saving with the MFI enables ready&#13;
access to funds for repairs and maintenance. The program provides technical support and has devised simple rules&#13;
enabling withdrawals without unnecessary bureaucracy. While so far this has not led to any loans, the cash flow&#13;
history of a given CBO provides favorable conditions for the future. One constraint has been the lack of a firm legal&#13;
status for the water committees of the CBOs. However, the regional water bureau is in the process of preparing a law&#13;
giving legal recognition to these committees, which will make it easier for them to get loans for major repairs or&#13;
expansion/augmentation of services. In Ethiopia the Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund&#13;
(ESRDF), funded by the World Bank, has also used MFIs to channel project funds in one of the regions where there is&#13;
no other financial institution to provide such services. It is likely that this can move to links during the operation&#13;
phase, as in the RWSEP in Amhara Region, if appropriate support is provided at the initial stages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Benin. GTZ/KfW are experimenting with microfinance and water programs in two villages in Benin: Allonkphon&#13;
and Zian in the Oueme and Mono regions. Members of these two villages have created committees to manage and&#13;
sell water sourced from a pump installed by a donor. The water is sold and revenues go into two bank accounts.&#13;
Both villages have accounts with the largest rural MFI, CRCAM, and earn 3 percent interest on savings: 80 percent&#13;
goes into a savings account (which is used for maintenance in case of breakdown) and the remaining 20 percent is&#13;
used for on-lending to the village population for new connections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Senegal. A study from Senegal also suggests that the ASUFORs (borehole users' associations) for rural multivillage&#13;
water schemes use the well-developed banking network in rural areas in Senegal. "They are becoming major clients&#13;
by virtue of the considerable proceeds from water sales that are deposited in their bank accounts. This situation&#13;
should facilitate the ASUFORs' access to credit for the maintenance or replacement of water systems."&#13;

&#13;
Nature of demand for finance. Most PSSPs meet                       of annual revenue. Similar disparities exist in&#13;
their working capital requirements through user                     the water sector, but with wider variation&#13;
charges. However, the lack of access to credit for                  between operators in different countries. This is&#13;
capital investments is often one of the main                        due to different regulatory environments and&#13;
constraints to new entry and expansion of                           different levels of utility development and&#13;
service by small providers.8 Thus, potential                        coverage in African cities. In most cases the&#13;
demand for finance from these different types of                    PSSPs rely on their own savings and borrowings&#13;
PSSPs is mainly for capital investments, either at                  from friends and relatives. Depending on the&#13;
entry level or for expansion and augmentation                       level of required initial investment, lack of&#13;
after an initial period of operation. Table 1                       access to credit inhibits new entry and can&#13;
shows illustrative entry costs associated with                      therefore limit competition. It must of course be&#13;
different types of SSPs. Of particular note is the                  recognized that access to credit is just one&#13;
wide variation in investment levels, depending                      constraint and cannot be addressed in isolation&#13;
upon the level of technology. Manual latrine                        from other constraints, such as the need for&#13;
cleaners, for example, invest only US$20­50,                        transparency in contracts with the PSSPs,&#13;
which represents between 1 and 6 percent of                         efficiency in billing and collection systems used&#13;
annual revenue for those businesses. Suction                        by the PSSPs, and regulation to ensure fair&#13;
tanker      businesses       require      large       capital       competition (Snell 1998).&#13;
investment, which represents up to 90 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

constraint.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                            Box 6. Categories of Water and Sanitation PSSPs in African Cities&#13;
&#13;
Water service providers. These include service providers in informal settlements, those catering to the special&#13;
demands of the rich and commercial establishments, and emerging providers in small towns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Water resellers: kiosks. These are widespread in cities in this region and often operate in informal settlements where it&#13;
is difficult to provide private individual connections. Kiosks may include storage facilities or, when legal status is&#13;
tenuous, simply consist of a lockable standpipe. They are responsible for the installation and maintenance of the&#13;
infrastructure and may not be formally regulated, in terms of price or service quality. However, they are often&#13;
licensed for connection from the utility, and there is often a special kiosk rate for water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Water vendors. Water in African cities is also often delivered to the point of use. At the low end of the technology&#13;
scale, water vendors carry containers of water to customers for a low fee using either handcarts or animal traction.&#13;
Water is sourced from a standpipe, and priced in the range of US$ 2 to 6 per cubic meter, compared to US$ 0.6 to 1.5&#13;
from a standpipe. Due to the higher prices households tend to use water vendors where timesaving results in&#13;
financial gain, and also tend to economize on volumes of water used from this source.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Water truckers. Water truckers tend to supply high-volume customers with water, including commercial and&#13;
institutional customers, construction sites, and private villas. Water truckers exist in cities where the utility&#13;
responsible for supply has an erratic and unreliable service. Though the investment required for water tankers is&#13;
significant, it can be recouped within a short time, given the strong demand in many cities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Borehole operators. Private operators also manage boreholes, often to supply water to truckers. In some cases they&#13;
combine the borehole and trucking businesses into one operation in order to internalize the activities and benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Small water networks. Some operators install small piped networks to supply their customers with water, using either&#13;
utility connections or other private sources. In Nairobi (Kenya) and Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire), for instance, private&#13;
water networks supply water to areas where the utility responsible for water supply does not operate. In some&#13;
countries such operators have been promoted in small towns through special programs, as in Mukono and Seguku&#13;
in Uganda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation service providers. These include service providers in informal settlements and small towns, and those&#13;
catering to the special demands of the rich and commercial establishments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Public toilet operators. In many African cities public toilet facilities, due to lack of maintenance, have fallen into&#13;
disrepair. Municipal authorities often allow private operators to operate the toilet facilities on a pay-on-use basis.&#13;
The arrangements vary from lease-type arrangements to full concessions, where the operator is required to invest&#13;
his/her own funds in the rehabilitation effort.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Manual latrine-cleaning services. Due to minimal sewerage coverage in African cities many inhabitants rely on pit&#13;
latrines for their sanitation needs, so the demand for latrine-cleaning services is quite significant. Manual exhausting&#13;
of latrines entails the use of a shovel and bucket to periodically remove the excreta from the latrine. Due to the&#13;
hygiene risks involved, the occupation tends to carry a significant social stigma. Such operators tend to work for&#13;
people they know, in a very local area, and earn very small profits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Suction truckers. Wealthier households employ mechanized suction truckers to empty their septic tanks. This system&#13;
is preferable to manual exhaustion due to the shorter time required to empty the pits and the possibility of waste&#13;
disposal at a distance. They operate in the formal sector, as vehicle registration is required. Their earnings can be&#13;
quite high; some operators in Nairobi (Kenya) and Bamako (Mali) have daily earnings of over US$100.&#13;

Figure 1 illustrates the influence of the legal                Capital    investments     for   expansion    and&#13;
status of the PSSP (through a license or a                     augmentation.        To      achieve     financial&#13;
franchise) and the scale of capital investment on              sustainability the PSSPs need to increase their&#13;
selection of particular finance solutions. As                  service coverage, which in turn is often&#13;
legitimacy     increases,    potential      for     credit     dependent on access to credit for the necessary&#13;
increases, using microfinance products for small               capital   investments.    The    size   of   such&#13;
investments; and as investment size also                       investments is likely to vary depending on the&#13;
increases, formal sector commercial credit                     technology, level of expansion needed, and&#13;
products become relevant. If the scale of                      prevailing costs. However, it may be easier to&#13;
investment is very small, however, there may                   provide credit for this, as a cash-flow history&#13;
not be demand for credit, as in the case of                    already exists; tenure-related issues can be&#13;
manual latrine exhaustion, which requires low                  assessed based on past experience, and demand&#13;
capital investment. In such cases, own savings                 for their services may be easier to assess. Thus,&#13;
or help/borrowing from relatives/friends are                   while legal and regulatory issues would still&#13;
sufficient. Figure 1 indicates that at some                    need to be addressed, credit may be structured&#13;
medium level of investment, with adequate                      on the basis of past history.&#13;
legal status, there would be demand for&#13;
microfinance products. As indicated, it is most&#13;
likely that water kiosks and small private&#13;
networks operate in this realm and represent&#13;
potential microfinance clients.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                            Box 9. Exploring Potential Opportunities in Selected Countries&#13;
Benin. The microfinance sector in Benin is well developed, with an outreach of over 350,000 members. It has&#13;
reasonable penetration, as most MFIs are concentrated in urban areas in the southern region. Existing MFIs have&#13;
been financing PSSPs in urban areas and see opportunities for further growth. Future opportunities exist both in&#13;
consolidating the partnership between the utility and PSSPs, and in expanding microfinance outreach to rural areas.&#13;
In both cases, market research to establish the nature of demand will be useful. From the perspective of the WSS&#13;
sector, the focus needs to be on creating and supporting space for private/community finance, particularly for RWS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Kenya. In 2002 Kenya passed a new Water Act, opening the sector to numerous institutional changes, including&#13;
decentralized water provision. Under this act water service providers will enter into contracts with the water&#13;
services boards, and be subject to regulation by the water services regulatory board. Kenya is endowed with a&#13;
relatively well developed microfinance sector: the cooperative sector has an outreach of over 1.7 million clients and&#13;
an outstanding portfolio of US$0.4 billion, and there are also some very effective MFIs such as K-REP. Opportunities&#13;
in rural areas include working with existing CBOs to provide financial services and credit for repairs and&#13;
augmentation; the provision of credit for rehabilitation linked to the transfer of existing public sector schemes to&#13;
CBOs; and the initiation of project financial services in new schemes. This requires both a firm legal basis for the&#13;
CBOs and appropriate technical support. In urban areas, the large number of PSSPs may present opportunities.&#13;
Market research is necessary to understand their finance needs. It will also require clarification of the link between&#13;
the utility (city councils or new city water companies) and the PSSPs. The possibility of using the SACCO model for&#13;
both rural CBOs and PSSPs working in urban informal settlements needs to be explored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Ethiopia. In rural Ethiopia CBOs are responsible for WSS. With decentralization this responsibility will increase. The&#13;
microfinance sector is relatively new, and has so far been dominated by government-supported MFIs. Of the total&#13;
coverage of about 0.6 million clients the share of the largest four MFIs is nearly 90 percent. In some regions, however,&#13;
these MFIs are the only financial services in rural areas. Some donor programs are already using the MFIs for&#13;
financial services in the implementation of rural water supply and sanitation projects, and to provide services to&#13;
CBOs during operations. These show potential for improved financial management of CBOs and will possibly&#13;
extend to credit for repairs and augmentation at a later stage. These opportunities need to be assessed and explored&#13;
further, for example through action research. This would enable their effective incorporation into a countrywide&#13;
RWS program. It would also be useful to explore the possibility of links with the proposed support program, funded&#13;
by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the European Union (EU), for strengthening the&#13;
microfinance sector in Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Uganda. Uganda has a few relatively mature and financially viable MFIs, though their collective outreach is only&#13;
about half a million clients. The emphasis in the microfinance sector thus needs to be on increasing the outreach of&#13;
MFIs while maintaining their financial sustainability. The WSS strategy in Uganda envisages limited community&#13;
shares, mainly through noncash contributions for rural water schemes, though for household sanitation there is&#13;
generally limited or no subsidies. However, lack of effective functioning and sustainability seem to be problems&#13;
faced by many existing schemes. Uganda, in its efforts to develop productive links between WSS and the&#13;
microfinance sector, may learn something from the Ethiopia experience of using the MFIs to provide financial&#13;
services to CBOs for scheme implementation and later operation (see box 4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Zambia. In Zambia the potential need for credit exists in both rural and urban WSS sectors: in RWS the emphasis is&#13;
on management by CBOs, and in peri-urban areas efforts are being made to evolve both CBO-based schemes and&#13;
participation by PSSPs. However, the microfinance sector in Zambia requires further development before links with&#13;
WSS can be usefully explored, though there may be some potential in current NGO initiatives to develop links&#13;
between CBOs and MFIs through action research.&#13;

                             3. The Role of Governments and Development Partners&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The main role of governments is to create an                      by insisting on adequate community share for&#13;

and       for     the    institutions      that     provide&#13;
microfinance services, both through policies and                  This is well illustrated by the findings of recent&#13;

                            Box 10. Illustrations of Partnerships between the Utility and PSSPs&#13;
&#13;
Benin: Société Beninoise d'Eau et de l'Electricité (SBEE). Benin provides a case where collaboration between the&#13;
central utility, SBEE, and independent resellers has led to increased service coverage where government did not&#13;
have the funding to expand service to the entire population. PSSPs enter into an agreement with SBEE, and fall into&#13;
one of three categories: metered rural groups, urban groups, or urban resellers at standpipes. In order to become a&#13;
supplier of water, a PSSP submits an application to SBEE for a connection. The new operator then pays a connection&#13;
fee and a water tariff of US$0.5/m3 for the water sold. Given the formal legitimacy of the SSP franchise, operators are&#13;
able to access finance facilities. Microfinance institutions offer loans to operators to extend their networks or invest&#13;
in other capital, and as their formal legitimacy decreases the risk of lending and the cost of lending are also lowered.&#13;
L'Association de Revendeurs d'Eau du Benin (AREB) was formed in 1999 and has over 150 members operating in&#13;
the Cotonou area. Members have over 20 years' experience in selling water. More cooperation is, however, required.&#13;
Though each member has a base of over 500 clients many find it hard to survive on this business alone. They claim&#13;
problems with high tariffs charged by the water utility, low water pressure causing time and water wastage, and&#13;
poor quality of pipes causing leakages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Zambia: Lusaka Water and Sewerage (LuWS). LuWS is the city's utility and was established in 1988. It sources&#13;
water from both surface reservoirs and groundwater sources. Some of the utility's piped network exists in peri-&#13;
urban areas and water from this source is administered through communal taps. LuWS has decided not to extend its&#13;
network into these areas due to infrastructure constraints, cost, and level of water supply. It has instead developed a&#13;
satellite system whereby water is pumped from on-site boreholes into elevated tanks, chlorinated, and distributed&#13;
through communal standpipes. A network of 50 standpipes services eight areas within the settlement. The structure&#13;
is managed and maintained in close collaboration with LuWS, who run it as a subbranch of their existing operations.&#13;
The actual distribution of water is managed by a community-elected resident development committee (RDC), which&#13;
appoints attendants to open the taps at certain times of the day and to monitor consumption using preinstalled&#13;
water meters. Customers are charged a fixed monthly fee of K 3,000 (US$0.77) for water and K 1,500 (US$0.38) for&#13;
maintenance. Those customers that are unable to pay monthly fees can access water at a cost of K 50 (US$0.013) per&#13;
20 liters. Money collected by the RDC is surrendered to the local LuWS branch that is responsible for maintaining&#13;
the system. So far, these fees have not been sufficient to cover maintenance costs and the project continues to rely on&#13;
donor support. The responsibility of overseeing the project has since been taken over by CARE International, who&#13;
established a water trust to manage the project more effectively. This trust consists of representatives from the local&#13;
council, LuWS, the RDC, and the community. It employs staff to manage operations and maintenance. Through a&#13;
contract with LuWS the trust falls within the regulatory framework and thereby extends the utility's coverage in the&#13;
city. The estimated coverage of this project is over 10 percent of Lusaka's residents.&#13;

            Financing small water supply and sanitation
            service providers - exploring the microfinance option in
            sub-Saharan Africa
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Increasingly, small water and sanitation
            service providers, such as community-based organizations,
            and private sector suppliers, are being acknowledged as
            important suppliers within the African water and sanitation
            sector. One of the important constraints faced by these
            providers is finance, and access to credit. This paper
            discusses the development of the microfinance sector, and
            services in sub-Saharan Africa, and the potential demand for
            financial services, by small water and sanitation service
            providers. The role of governments, and development partners
            in facilitating the finance, and credit for small providers,
            is also discussed.
