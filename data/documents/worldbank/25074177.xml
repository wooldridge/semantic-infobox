&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                               2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A]1&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Well, you know, late president Sukarno was, he banned everybody, kicked&#13;
everybody out. His famous slogan was, â&#128;&#156;Go to hell with your aid!â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: â&#128;&#156;Go to hell with your aid,â&#128;&#157; huh.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: â&#128;&#156;Go to hell with your aid!â&#128;&#157; And actually--previously, I mean, you know,&#13;
actually the World Bank has in the crisis in the â&#128;&#152;60s, in Sukarno's period, the Bank has&#13;
prepared a study, I mean a survey, for how to come out of it, of the difficulties. And I&#13;
mean the normal receipt of the World Bank and the IMF [International Monetary Fund] ,&#13;
you know: budget increase, decrease in deficits, and the management of the foreign&#13;
exchange rate, export drive and so on. And actually that isâ&#128;&#148;this is politics. And it was--&#13;
we had in our government two people, the first minister Djuanda, he was a liberal.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Djuanda, huh?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: With [Johannes] Leimena, his vice, was also a liberal. But they have to serve&#13;
under Sukarno, who was inclinedâ&#128;&#148;heâ&#128;&#153;s not a communist himself but inclined to, to let&#13;
the communists to join the government. So they were under pressure, internal cabinet&#13;
was under pressure, the communists not to accept the advice of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This was in the early â&#128;&#152;60s?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: 1960s, yeah, 1960s. I was in parliament at that time. I was a member of&#13;
parliament. I was vice chairman of the budget committee of the parliament, so I know&#13;
this. So the internal fighting in the government, I still remember that the Prime Minister,&#13;
Djuanda, he came to me during a debate on budget. He told me, â&#128;&#156;So, tell the government&#13;
to do the right thing because Leimena and me, we cannot do any more. We are at the end&#13;
of our strength.â&#128;&#157; So now, so then I went to parliament and start, you know, against the&#13;
government, you know, the policies. So that was a very good advice.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That was written in Washington, I take it.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: I think in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
And we had in our central bank a man calledâ&#128;&#148;I canâ&#128;&#153;t--a Chinese director of the bank, of&#13;
our Bank of Indonesia. Later on, you know, in 1966 when I start coming to join the&#13;
group, the World Bank and IMF again, I assigned him as the first director of Indonesia to&#13;
the IMF. That was Mr.--I can't remember his name, a Chinese origin.&#13;
&#13;
So World Bank came out. President Sukarno was so under pressure from the communists&#13;
so he refused the whole advice with the man, together with that Indonesian director, he&#13;

                                 November 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
has to leave the country--and then proclaimed what he called the â&#128;&#156;Demokrasi Ekonomi&#13;
Sistem,â&#128;&#157; Indonesian Economic Democracy System, and it is democracy a la Sukarno, that&#13;
means all in government's hands, all in governmentâ&#128;&#153;s--the government is the leading&#13;
factor in the economy. So thatâ&#128;&#153;s to start this.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Again, that's 1966, right?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: No, no, before. It was in â&#128;&#152;61-â&#128;&#152;62, â&#128;&#153;61-â&#128;&#152;62. It was still under Sukarno. We have&#13;
then, that is the period, five years period, of what we called â&#128;&#156;guided democracyâ&#128;&#157; and&#13;
â&#128;&#156;guided economyâ&#128;&#157; of President Sukarno. So it started right there, but then he bent and&#13;
then he refused.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: He--so to start this, because then you know the history. Later on the Bank came&#13;
back. That's actually, they start again with the same advice.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I didn't know about this earlier episode, did you?&#13;
&#13;
[Pause for telephone]&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: . . in '62. I was in parliament in '61.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Was Indonesia still a member of the Bank at that time, or had they resigned&#13;
already?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: No, no. Still member.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They were still a member at that time. Then when did you--you resigned in . .&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Resigned in '64, â&#128;&#153;63-â&#128;&#153;64, â&#128;&#152;64.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: In '64. I see.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: When [Eugene R.] Black, Mr. Black--he was director of the Bank . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: President.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: President of the Bankâ&#128;&#148;he refused to receive our minister Chaerul Saleh.&#13;
Chaerul Saleh was the minister for economic affairs, and he went to Washington, and Mr.&#13;
Black refused to receive him. And then Sukarno said, â&#128;&#156;That's an insult for the republic.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Why did he refuse to see him?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: I don't know. Mr. Black was, Eugene Black . . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Frans Seda&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Black left in '63.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: That would be around that time, should be around '63. So that should be. Then&#13;
the advice was in '62 or '61 because I was in parliament in '61, and then around '63 then&#13;
Sukarno said, â&#128;&#156;Go to hell with your aid.â&#128;&#157; It was after Eugene Black refused to receive&#13;
our . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Had Indonesia borrowed any from the Bank before then?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Standby. Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, standby is from the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: No, no, but we had not too much. It was very, veryâ&#128;&#148;not so much account, I&#13;
think 50 million dollars.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I just wonder whether that got caught up in this big debt rescheduling.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Oh, no, no, no, no. We are missing actually our interest, our dividend. That's&#13;
another story. When I called the Bank back, I asked the Bank, â&#128;&#156;Now you have to pay me&#13;
dividends for three, four years--in '66--four years' dividends.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
They say, â&#128;&#156;Sorry, sir, because your president pays all together also the dividends.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
[Laughter] But that starts then. So those are very . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Excuse me. Iâ&#128;&#153;m sorry to interrupt, but do you remember any name from that . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Who wrote the report?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In '61, '62 in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: No, I was not familiar with the Bank at that time. I was in parliament or-- Prime&#13;
Minister Djuanda and Leimena, they were the liberals in the government, and they asked&#13;
me as a member of the parliament, â&#128;&#156;Try to save, because the government's policy is very&#13;
much influenced by the communists.â&#128;&#157; And under influence of communists, President&#13;
Sukarno refused the advice of the Bank. Instead of that he proclaimed the DEKON,&#13;
Demokrasi Ekonomi, the new policy where everything is in state hands. The government&#13;
owns everythingâ&#128;&#148;socialist, socialist management of the economy. So that is to start&#13;
with.&#13;
&#13;
And then in 1966 I became minister of finance in June, I think, yeah, June 1966--no, no,&#13;
no, no, no, afterward, July. The cabinet, Ampera Cabinet, was after July. I think&#13;
between July and August. Now my first deed--because, you know, we had the cabinet of&#13;
a hundred ministers. I was beforeâ&#128;&#148;in â&#128;&#153;64, I became minister in â&#128;&#153;64 of plantations, in '64.&#13;
I was the number 104, 104 minister! And my only duty in plantations was to prevent&#13;
takeover by the communists, the only one. There was no money, nothing I can do. I&#13;
&#13;
                                  Frans Seda&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
can't do anything. It is only the political, to maintain that it's not in the hands of the&#13;
communists because they have a very strong labor movement in plantations. The&#13;
strongest in Indonesia is in the plantations, but I managed to keep them down.&#13;
&#13;
One of my problems with the communists was they pressed me, pressed the government,&#13;
to nationalize all the plantations, foreign plantations. It was a very big riot in--so I say,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;No, because nationalization, this is stealing, so I don't like.â&#128;&#157; I told President Sukarno,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;If you press me, then here, I don't do it.â&#128;&#157; But what I did was I take over the&#13;
management with the consent of the plantation, Goodyear and all these foreign. I call&#13;
them one by one. I told them, â&#128;&#156;Now, here you see the communists. They are going to&#13;
the plantations to burn it. So what we can do is you give me the management. I take&#13;
over the management, and I will manage it for you during these years. I still recognize&#13;
your ownership, and in due time then we will fix about how to.â&#128;&#157; So that was my own--in&#13;
'64--in â&#128;&#153;66.&#13;
&#13;
In â&#128;&#153;64, and then I became minister of agriculture because plantation was under a&#13;
compartment of agriculture with a minister for the compartment. So I became the&#13;
minister of agriculture. So to reduce the number, because in agriculture there were five&#13;
ministers: minister of plantations, minister of foodstuffs, minister of forestry, minister of&#13;
fisheries, and minister for irrigation. So when I became in '66, became minister of&#13;
agriculture, I had to, in one ministry only one minister of agriculture. All the former&#13;
ministers became director generals. So my colleagues became my director generals. It&#13;
was in March 1966.&#13;
&#13;
And then in July 1966 I became minister of finance. And that is how the first day in my&#13;
office was to send a cable to Washington to IMF and the World Bank, â&#128;&#156;Please come&#13;
back!â&#128;&#157; It was my first . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: First thing. When did Sukarno go?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: He went officially--I mean, he startâ&#128;&#148;in Indonesia, you know, we have the&#13;
system of not to get out of balance, you know. He is ultimately down from power in&#13;
1968, but the process start in 1966. He is still formally the leader, but Suharto has come&#13;
along. First, he cannot do anything without Suharto's consent, and then later on in 1966,&#13;
after the People's Council, then Suharto get the power from him to form the cabinet. And&#13;
in the first Ampera Cabinet, '66, I became minister of finance.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. So that was under Suharto's influence then.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yeah, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. The first--actually the first New Order cabinet, so under&#13;
Suharto. Sukarno was still formally the president but the power is with Suharto.&#13;
&#13;
And my first job [inaudible] because I asked him how much--we are bankrupt, bankrupt,&#13;
totally bankrupt, inflation of 650 percent in June in '66, bankrupt, and the main thing was&#13;
nobody knows exactly what is our debt, how much. Nobody knows! Because the World&#13;
Bank--Bank Indonesia used to be the bank administrative, and that became a ministry.&#13;
&#13;
                                    Frans Seda&#13;
                             November 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So in any ministry, you know, they don't have good administration. In the whole world&#13;
no ministry has a good administration. Even the Bank Indonesia didn't know how much&#13;
exactly how debt was. You know how . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This is official debt?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: The official debt, the official debt. It was first roughly 2.8 billion; that was the&#13;
first figure. So we tell the people, â&#128;&#156;Sukarno must goâ&#128;&#157; because the debt was 2.8 billion&#13;
dollars. But nobody knew exactly. So I called all the ambassadorsâ&#128;&#148;American, allâ&#128;&#148;so&#13;
just to tell them, â&#128;&#156;Excellency, I would like to check with you how much. We don't have&#13;
any figures, but just to . . .â&#128;&#157; You know politics! And out of these meetings with all the&#13;
ambassadors, United States, American ambassador gave us a file, like this. Then we&#13;
came to 2.3 billion.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: 2.3. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s debt?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yes, yes. So I reported to the cabinet, â&#128;&#156;Now we have, we saved $500 million.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
Saved 500 million! [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
But that is--I phoned up; I sent a cable, â&#128;&#156;Come back.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
My first contact was with the IMF because the managing director then was at that time a&#13;
Dutch professor of mine (I studied economics in Holland), Professor [Pieter] Lieftinck.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Lieftinck! Yes, yes, yes! He was a famous man in the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Well, this was before the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, later with the World Bank. He was a professor in Holland; he was also&#13;
the finance minister.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yeah. So I wrote him a letter, â&#128;&#156;Dear--Your former pupil is now minister of&#13;
finance of a bankrupt. So what can you do? Please come back.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So, and then I got a letter [inaudible] , â&#128;&#156;All right.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;So send a team,â&#128;&#157; that was my first appeal, â&#128;&#156;Send a team. Just come back and send a&#13;
team to settle the economy of Indonesia.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
And then I got: â&#128;&#156;All right, we'll send you a team, but settle first your debts.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
I even don't know that we have the standing order--what was it?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Standby.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Standby agreement. I didn't know. As minister of finance, I didn't know that we&#13;
&#13;
                                    Frans Seda&#13;
                             November 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
have also a 55 million dollar standby.&#13;
&#13;
So how do you solve this? So I don't know how to solve it. So I said, â&#128;&#156;Look, that is why&#13;
I asked you to come! To advise me how to pay you!â&#128;&#157; And they came in August.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: August of '66?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yeah, '66. They came.&#13;
&#13;
And then in the meantime the World Bank, because I asked them to come back also, and&#13;
then this story about the dividends. See, I thought that we have still some deposits with&#13;
the Bank. Say, â&#128;&#156;No, your president waived everything including the dividends.â&#128;&#157; So.&#13;
&#13;
And then the first thing to do was the team to how to stabilize the economy.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This was the IMF team?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: IMF team, yeah. IMF team was first. It was in August. And there was this&#13;
pressure from our side because at the end of Augustâ&#128;&#148;it was the new cabinet already--at&#13;
the end of August we have to go around the world, to make a visit to all these creditor&#13;
countries to tell them what is our policy, what is the new economic vision of this New&#13;
Order, and for that we need this team. And I organized a team, Indonesian counterparts&#13;
under my director--he was inspector general in my office in the ministry of finance--and&#13;
he coordinated the Indonesian side, ministry of finance and the Bank Indonesia, to meet&#13;
the IMF. And one of the members of my is Rachmat Saleh. Perhaps you have heard the&#13;
name, Rachmat Saleh?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yeah, yeah, he was later the central bank. Rachmat Saleh.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Rachmat Saleh, he was at that time on my staff. And the first man sent out by&#13;
the IMF was Tun Thin, Tun Thin.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, I knew him.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: A very tough man, very tough. But we need advice to formulate our policy for&#13;
lessons because--and that's my first, my point--we have to rehabilitate confidence. That's&#13;
to start with, internally. My policy in financing, my finance management is to start with&#13;
confidence-building internally by our own people, that they have trust in the government&#13;
and the government's management of economic affairs but also confidence of foreign&#13;
countries. And you can only get confidence from foreign countries if you go through&#13;
IMF and the World Bank. So that was the logic and the philosophy behind it. And it was&#13;
a very good team.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Frans Seda&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And then they came with the political statement, the first political statement of the New&#13;
Order, that is this: to bring down the inflation, inflation rate, to have a united exchange&#13;
rate policy because at the time we have multiple exchange rates. For every product you&#13;
have a special exchange rate or by subsidy or by interest rate, lower differential benefit.&#13;
â&#128;&#156;No. We will have just one.â&#128;&#157; And then credit policy, what we call very strict and well-&#13;
managed credit policy, and a balanced budget.&#13;
&#13;
Now, management actually is not what the--and then later on when are processing in the&#13;
teamwork with the IMF, the World Bank join.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Was that so? In â&#128;&#153;66 . .&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: In '66, August, September, the World Bank joined.&#13;
&#13;
And there's another story about the World Bank joining, but because when we came--&#13;
perhaps I'm telling you that, but, you know, before that, before the New Order&#13;
government, there's the process in '66 already, we had a meeting in Tokyo . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: . . in Tokyo about the settlementâ&#128;&#148;now there was, no, no, no, difference in the&#13;
approach. The creditor countries are looking only on the new credits. They are ready to&#13;
give new credits, but I argue, â&#128;&#156;No, I would like to link it with old credits, how to settle&#13;
my old credits. So that should be one package.â&#128;&#157; And that was not--in Tokyo they cannot&#13;
get that idea and that was laterâ&#128;&#148;was it?--referred to Paris.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: To Paris?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yeah, because they say about settlement of debts, government debts, is the Paris&#13;
Club. So there are two process, you know. First is the process of getting a policy&#13;
statement; that is with the IMF. And then later on the World Bank came when we are&#13;
discussing about the aftermath of the Tokyo meeting and the Paris meeting.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Came in after the Paris meeting, also, huh?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yeah, but since--it start in those periods when the World Bank is coming.&#13;
Actually, in the beginning my attention was more on the IMF, to tell you the truth, IMF&#13;
because I would like to have them there. But later on after discussions in Tokyo and later&#13;
in Paris--in Tokyo was in September and I think the next month, October, November,&#13;
was in Paris because the IGGI [Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia] was founded,&#13;
established in February 1967.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: â&#128;&#153;67.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yeah. So then the World Bank . .&#13;
&#13;
                                   Frans Seda&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You and Professor Widjojo [Nitisastro] both went to the Tokyo meeting? Is&#13;
that right?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yeah, Widjojo. I am not there, not personally, but my people. Actually the&#13;
Tokyo club, at the Tokyo meeting was--the leader of the Indonesian delegation was my&#13;
inspector general, [H.A.] Pandelaki, Mr. Pandelaki. He was the leader of the Indonesian&#13;
delegation, and then later in Paris, too, and later also the first meeting in Amsterdam.&#13;
And then, because the chairman of the IGGI is a minister so it should be a minister from&#13;
the Indonesian side, and then we assign the minister for BAPPENAS [Badan&#13;
Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional, National Development Planning Board] , for&#13;
Planning Board. So that was this history.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: But so I still remember the World Bank one day came to me, and they say, â&#128;&#156;Sir,&#13;
actually a consortium should be led by World Bank. That is international standard.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So we said, â&#128;&#156;Oh, not here. No, not in our caseâ&#128;&#157; because most of all our debts were&#13;
government debts, thereâ&#128;&#153;s no private. Even--there are some private debts, but it's&#13;
guaranteed by the government. So out of 2.3 billion debts of which I think without to&#13;
the--no, no, one billion is, around 800 million is to the Soviet Union. So there are a few--&#13;
200,000 dollars, I think--from the American bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Ex-Im Bank [Export-Import Bank] ?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Ex-Im Bank was to private enterprise but guaranteed by the government. So I&#13;
told the World Bank, â&#128;&#156;All right, no, no, no, no, I would like to have a consortium led by&#13;
the government, but then you, I would like to ask you as consultants.â&#128;&#157; So that is actually&#13;
the position of the World Bank and the IMF in our consortium, the position of&#13;
consultants, consultants for Indonesia and consultants for the donor countries. And I&#13;
think because of this position that is why it was so successful because before the meeting,&#13;
the official meeting of the IGGI, we are already consulted. We are on a continuous&#13;
consultationâ&#128;&#148;that was successful--continuous consultation between the World Bank and&#13;
the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
And then they asked me, then they should have a resident mission here in Indonesia, and&#13;
we said, â&#128;&#156;All right, with all the diplomatic facilities and so on and so on for the Bank and&#13;
the IMF.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, Mr. [Kemal] Siber came first?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Siber, yeah. Siber came. Siber is not from the World Bankâ&#128;&#148;IMF. And Siber,&#13;
no, after Tun Thin.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, well, Tun Thin, I think Siber says Tun Thin sent him.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Frans Seda&#13;
                           November 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Siber was very good guy. We had meetings. I mean, my&#13;
director general for finance, of for budget, he slept in my home because we have a&#13;
meeting with IMF and the World Bank up â&#128;&#152;til 2 o'clock in the morning. It started with a&#13;
reception at 7 o'clock, and then at 7 o'clock started the Indonesian side our own internal&#13;
meeting until 4 o'clock.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, my.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yes, it was a very hectic time in the beginning, but everybody was happy&#13;
because you see that we are coming out of the mud.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: How long were you in office?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: I was in office, finance, minister of finance, '66 â&#128;&#152;til '68, the two years of the&#13;
rehabilitation/stabilization period. So we formulate with the IMF two years' stabilization&#13;
and rehabilitation. The stabilization is to stabilize the prices and the exchange rate, so&#13;
down from 650. When I left office in 1968 it was 120, in two years. It should be around&#13;
60 but then we have a very bad rice at that time, so the inflation rate was [inaudible] It&#13;
was every day, every day devaluation, but nobody . . . But I did it not through the official&#13;
devaluation but the increase of the import duties, increase in . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So the de facto exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yeah, yeah, of import duties. So it--when I start it was 1dollar/10 rupiah official&#13;
rate and then later 1 dollar/45 rupiah official, but in the marketplace it was already 230.&#13;
So then I moved very fast to 230 in one year. And then through also the system of the&#13;
BE [Bonus Export] credit, you know, because all the foreign credits to Indonesia, I put it&#13;
in one bowl and sell it to the private enterprise. So the rupiah is for the budget,&#13;
incremental budget, but by selling the credits they are obliged what they have to import&#13;
and in which time frame.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay, so youâ&#128;&#153;d auction off in effect these . .&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: We auctioned the credits, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . these tied-aid pieces to whoever wanted to this, to get something from the&#13;
U.K. for something.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yeah. That is why the first--up until now, actually--the biggest part of the&#13;
income of the state is from credits, foreign. So I put it in there, what they call the&#13;
development budget. Itâ&#128;&#153;s income for development budget. That is the system we&#13;
introduced.&#13;
&#13;
Japan was against it. The ambassador from Japan, Saito [Shizuo] , came to me, say, â&#128;&#156;No,&#13;
sir. Japan cannot accept thisâ&#128;&#157; because it is assistance, budget assistance and tax&#13;
&#13;
                                   Frans Seda&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
assistance, and they may not, according to the law.&#13;
&#13;
So I told him, â&#128;&#156;All right, sir, if you cannot join.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
He said, â&#128;&#156;Why? You need money now.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
I said, â&#128;&#156;All right, I need money, but I wait until you change your law.â&#128;&#157; A week later he&#13;
came, yes, agreed. [Laugher]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: They changed that law?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yeah, they changed the law, and we get the credit. Theyâ&#128;&#148;how do you call it--&#13;
they booked the export, export subsidy credit.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You were succeeded by whom?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: I was succeeded by Ali Wardhana, so my term was the stabilization and the&#13;
rehabilitation periods, and the stabilization and the rehabilitation actually of confidence,&#13;
that was, that was the confidence of foreign countries because during my period the&#13;
foreign investment law in 1967, the IGGI in 1967, and then the domestic investment law&#13;
in 1968, and then the first balanced budget 1967, a law, and then the tight money policy&#13;
and tight credit policy. So that was the four, under liberalization of foreign exchange. So&#13;
the free, free--you can come into Indonesia and leave Indonesia with foreign exchange as&#13;
much as you--you don't need to report. You need to ask for a license for foreign&#13;
exchange. The free regime, that was from my time. Those are the five--what the&#13;
government is still doing now.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, the same pattern carried forward.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Only the number is bigger. I still remember my first budget was one billion&#13;
rupiah state income, one billion rupiah, an expenditure of 16 billion rupiah, so 15 billion&#13;
deficit! [Laughter] Horrible, horrible. So I changed it mid-term. It was in 1966 when I&#13;
became--because the law was accepted, introduced in January 1966. So I became&#13;
minister in July. So I adjust it, make it 16 billion, more realistic 16 billion income, state&#13;
income, and 23 billion . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, thatâ&#128;&#153;s an [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: . . for 1966, and 16 billion--you know, well, that is from the realistic, what I call&#13;
â&#128;&#156;realisticâ&#128;&#157; import duty management, and from all this centralization of the budget&#13;
because â&#128;&#152;til that time the budget was--every minister had his own budget, no control.&#13;
And at the end of the year everybody's putting the deficit under the ministry of finance.&#13;
That was the system. I said, â&#128;&#156;No, no, stop.â&#128;&#157; That was the 16, 23, and the first balanced&#13;
budget was in 1967 at the level of 84 billion rupiah. That was the first balanced budget.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right. Now, the rupiah was how many to the dollar at that time?&#13;
&#13;
                                    Frans Seda&#13;
                             November 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: The dollar was in 1966, officially, if you take official, was in the beginning 10&#13;
rupiah/dollar and then 45 rupiah/dollar, but the market, black market is 230. And that&#13;
was my target, was to get to 230. It is more realistic, and one of this by selling the BE,&#13;
the credits.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, that fills out our background a great deal on this. Did you have much to&#13;
do with the Bank after you retired from being minister of finance?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Well, from the ministry of finance I became minister of communications and&#13;
tourism. And then my--with tourism was I invited [Robert S.] McNamara when I was&#13;
still minister of finance.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, did you?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yeah. When he changed from secretary of defense to become--but actually he&#13;
visited Indonesia when I was transferred to communications. Three days [inaudible]&#13;
then he came . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Three days after you made the switch, you mean?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Three days after I became minister of communications, then he came.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It was in June of '68.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: '68, yeah. And I still remember. I had him in my home, breakfast, and he was&#13;
going around, you know, very nervously. So I said, â&#128;&#156;Sir, put your leg on my table.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Oh, yeah. May I do it?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Yes.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
He say, â&#128;&#156;So how do you know?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
I say, â&#128;&#156;Because I have seen it in the pictures. You are always sitting with your leg on&#13;
tables!â&#128;&#157; [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
And then because I was also assigned for tourism, minister of communications and&#13;
tourism, and this hotel, this hotel was at that time--it was a hotel planned by President&#13;
Sukarno, the biggest and the most expensive hotel in the world. His idea was a hotel of&#13;
200 rooms with 12 million dollar plan in 1960, 12 million dollar investment. So each&#13;
room 60,000 dollars of 1960. So that was the idea, but what happened, it was corruption&#13;
and everything. It was old, black. There were six floors, all iron rust.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Just a frame, huh?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Frans Seda&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Yes, just the frame, you know. When I became minister of tourism, so I told the&#13;
president, â&#128;&#156;So we have to destroy it, or we have to go on, but it cannot be like this.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So the president said, â&#128;&#156;What's your program?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;I would like to go on.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Yes, do it, but no money from the government. So try to do it yourself.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So and then during the breakfast with McNamara, so I told him, you know, â&#128;&#156;I'm now also&#13;
interested in this tourism. Can the World Bank do something in tourism?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Yes, yeah, under my presidency I will push itâ&#128;&#157; because up â&#128;&#152;til now, up â&#128;&#153;til that&#13;
time, the World Bank has only one projectâ&#128;&#148;in Algiers, I thinkâ&#128;&#148;a hotel of five million&#13;
dollar.&#13;
&#13;
He said, â&#128;&#156;Now, under my presidency I would like to push it.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So when he went back, I was assigned to continue this with no money from the&#13;
government, I wrote him a letter, I said, â&#128;&#156;Mr. McNamara, you still remember, you&#13;
promised me under your presidency. Now here I am. I have a project. The government .&#13;
. .â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Then he said, â&#128;&#156;All right. The World Bank itself cannot with the project, but I will send&#13;
you somebody from the IFC.â&#128;&#157; And he sent me a consultant by name of Goldman to assist&#13;
me how to do it.&#13;
&#13;
So the man came here. I told him, â&#128;&#156;Don't ask me. You have toâ&#128;&#148;you can come to me&#13;
every morning between 6 and 7. This is time for you in my home, and I have only to&#13;
sign. Don't ask me. It is your duty to assist me how to continue with no money of the&#13;
government.â&#128;&#157; So that was after my office when I was out of . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Then you did get IFC financing?&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Oh, no. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s one of the bestâ&#128;&#148;no, not ever, really, no. The further story was&#13;
this: I need another 26 million dollars, to get. So the IFC told me, â&#128;&#156;You have to go up.&#13;
You cannot stay at six floors. You have to go up to make it more economical, to 19&#13;
floors or 20 floors, 900 rooms.â&#128;&#157; And at that time it cost 26 million dollars only, in&#13;
1967â&#128;&#148;in 1970--the hotel. Where to get money for ourselves? Told the IFC, â&#128;&#156;Don't ask&#13;
me.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
I only asked the president, â&#128;&#156;We have credit line open from French.â&#128;&#157; Of the 12 million&#13;
dollars, 7 million dollars is already used for the old construction, you know. There is still&#13;
5 million dollars left. So I asked the president, â&#128;&#156;Give me the 5 million dollars. May I use&#13;
it?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Frans Seda&#13;
                            November 25, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Yes, you may use it.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
But the trouble was there some French construction, and France created Societe General.&#13;
There were two friends: the construction company and the president of the bank, two&#13;
friends. One died, and there is a new bank director. He was an enemy. So he stopped&#13;
the credit, like all the French people [inaudible], stopped the credit. So there I am.&#13;
&#13;
Now, luckily enough, the president was visiting France, our president. So I asked him,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Please discuss this with [Georges] Pompidouâ&#128;&#157;--Pompidou was the presidentâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#156;to get&#13;
back the 5 million.â&#128;&#157; So this is the only hotel discussed at the highest level between two&#13;
presidents! Two presidents! [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
But then how? So I asked the IFC to do it, and then the IFC said, â&#128;&#156;All right. If you like&#13;
we invest, but the government should join.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
This is impossible for us because the president, you know: â&#128;&#156;You don't get any money&#13;
from government.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So then what to do? I asked the bank, a government bank, BDN [Bank Dagang Negara]&#13;
[inaudible] develop, I asked him, â&#128;&#156;Do you join?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
To the Bank, to the IFC, I told the IFC, â&#128;&#156;This is a government's bank but it is an&#13;
autonomous body, but it's a government's body. So you have to accept it as a&#13;
government.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Yes. All right.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
And now to the president. I told the president, â&#128;&#156;This is the government's bank, but it is an&#13;
autonomy.â&#128;&#157; All right. I get it! And then we continue building.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I didn't notice. This goes up to the . . .&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: To the nineteenth floor.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Nineteenth floor.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Nine hundred. It was â&#128;&#152;til Shangri-La [Hotel] , before Shangri-La in Singapore,&#13;
the biggest in Southeast Asia. Ten hectares.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It's a great [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Oh, yes.&#13;

LEWIS: It's amazing.&#13;
&#13;
I guess we should move along.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: You are free. I have more information because I am very happy for me to recall&#13;
the whole . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It's wonderful to hear you recall it.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Absolutely fascinating.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We have this terrible problem of having too many people, fascinating people to&#13;
talk with in too short a time. We should come longer, but we're staying twice as long&#13;
here as in other countries.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: You go from here to Ali Wardhana?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, that's right.&#13;
&#13;
SEDA: Itâ&#128;&#153;s what he said. He came after me.&#13;
