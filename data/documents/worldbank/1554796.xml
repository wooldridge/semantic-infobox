Abstract&#13;
Investment in education is generally recognized to be essential for a&#13;
country's long-term economic and social development. However, present&#13;
macroeconomic conditions in many developing countries have obliged their&#13;
governments to slow down increases in the allocation of public resources&#13;
for education. As a result, the education sector is likely to develop only&#13;
slowly, if at all; enrollment, already low in the poorer of the developing&#13;
countries, would remain low, while the social demand for education would&#13;
continue to be substantially unmet. In this setting, policy makers have&#13;
recently focussed their attention on finding alternative sources of finance&#13;
for education, one of which is the tapping of private household resources&#13;
via user charges.&#13;
To mobilize resources by this method, we need first to address two&#13;
main issues: firstly, are families able and willing to pay; and secondly,&#13;
what can user charges accomplish in terms of expanding the size of realized&#13;
enrollment, given the public budget constraint? Country-specific&#13;
conditions are likely to influence the outcome of these questions, and&#13;
obviously, they would determine the importance of user charges as a means&#13;
of mobilizing private household resources.&#13;
In this paper, we attempt to answer these questions in the case of&#13;
Malawi. The data used concern mainly primary and secondary schooling. The&#13;
empirical evidence suggests that (i) a moderate fee increase is unlikely to&#13;
precipitate a large drop-out rate among students (primary and secondary)&#13;
currently enrolled. For example, a 10 percent increase in the average fees&#13;
to enroll eligible children reduces the proportion enrolled per household&#13;
merely from 0.58 to 0.55; (ii) even if some currently enrolled students do&#13;
drop-out excess demand, particularly for secondary schooling, is large&#13;
enough so that if the fee increease is associated with an increase in the&#13;
supply of places, the overall number effectively enrolled would be larger&#13;
than in the situation without the fee increase; and (iii) increases in fees&#13;
are likely to have a stronger impact on lower income families, so that they&#13;
should be linked with equity measures, such as a limited number of&#13;
scholarships awarded on the basis of income and academic performance.&#13;

Extracto&#13;
En general, se reconoce que la inversi6n en educaci6n es esencial para el&#13;
desarrollo econ6mico y social a largo plazo de un pais. No obstante, las cir-&#13;
cunstancias macroecon6micas que existen actualmente en muchos paises en desa-&#13;
rrollo han obligado a los gobiernos de estos a incrementar las asignaciones de&#13;
recursos puiblicos para educaci6n en menor proporci6n que antes. Como resul-&#13;
tado, es probable que el sector de la educaci6n se desarrolle lentamente, si es&#13;
que liega a desarrollarse; el numero de alumnos matriculados, que ya es bajo en&#13;
los paises en desarrollo mAs pobres, seguira siendo bajo en tanto que la&#13;
demanda social de educaci6n quedaria --en gran parte-- sin satisfacer. Dada&#13;
esta situaci6n, en los ultimos tiempos los rectores de la politica se han con-&#13;
centrado en encontrar otras fuentes de financiamiento para la educaci6n, entre&#13;
las cuales se cuentan los recursos privados de las familias, que se obtendrian&#13;
mediante la imposici6n de cargos a los usuarios.&#13;
Antes de movilizar recursos por este metodo necesitamos, en primer lugar,&#13;
las respuestas a dos importantes preguntas: en primer lugar, Zestan las fami-&#13;
lias en condiciones de pagar y dispuestas a ello? y en segundo lugar, iqu6 se&#13;
puede lograr mediante los cargos a los usuarios en lo que respecta a aumentar&#13;
el ntunero de alumnos matriculados, dada la limitaci6n del presupuesto puiblico?&#13;
Es probable que las condiciones que existan en cada pais influyan en la res-&#13;
puesta a estas dos preguntas y que, evidentemente, las respuestas determinen la&#13;
importancia de los cargos a los usuarios como medio de movilizar los recursos&#13;
privados de las familias.&#13;
En este trabajo intentamos contestar estas preguntas en el caso de&#13;
Malawi. Los datos usados corresponden principalmente a escuelas primarias y&#13;
secundarias. Las pruebas empiricas parecen indicar que i) es poco probable que&#13;
un aumento moderado de los cargos provoque una tasa de deserci6n elevada entre&#13;
los estudiantes matriculados actualmente (en escuelas primarias y secunda-&#13;
rias). Por ejemplo, si el precio medio de la matricula de ninios calificados&#13;
para asistir a la escuela aumenta en 10%, la proporci6n de ninos matriculados&#13;
por familia disminuye solamente de 0,58 a 0,55; ii) aun cuando algunos alumnos&#13;
matriculados actualmente desertaran, el exceso de demanda --especialmente de&#13;
plazas en escuelas secundarias-- es suficientemente grande, de modo que si el&#13;
aumento de precio estuviera unido a un aumento de las plazas el niunero de&#13;
alumnos matriculados seria mayor que si no se hubiera aumentado el precio, y&#13;
iii) es probable que el aumento de precio afecte en mayor medida a las familias&#13;
de bajos ingresos, de modo que tendria que ir unido a medidas equitativas, como&#13;
el otorgamiento de un nuimero reducido de becas sobre la base del ingreso de la&#13;
familia de cada alumno y el desempenio de este en sus estudios.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II est gen6ralement admis que les investissements dans le secteur de&#13;
l'education sont indispensables au developpement 6conomique et social a&#13;
long terme d'un pays. Toutefois, la situation 6conomique generale de&#13;
nombreux pays en developpement est telle qu'ils ont dui se r6soudre a&#13;
ralentir le rythme d'accroissement. du budget de l'6ducation. II est a&#13;
penser que ce secteur ne se d6veloppera que lentement, si tant est qu'il&#13;
se developpe. Les effectifs scolaires, deja peu importants dans les pays&#13;
en developpement les plus d6sherit6s, demeureront faibles alors qu'une&#13;
partie notable de la demande sociale d'education restera non satisfaite.&#13;
Confront6s a ces problemes, les responsables se sont efforces, depuis&#13;
quelque temps, de trouver d'autres sources de financement pour&#13;
l'6ducation. L'une d'elles consiste a faire appel au secteur prive en&#13;
demandant une contribution financiere aux familles.&#13;
Pour appliquer cette m6thode, il faut d'abord repondre a deux&#13;
questions : premierement, les familles ont-elles les moyens de payer et&#13;
sont-elles disposees a le faire; et deuxiemement, compte tenu des&#13;
contraintes budgetaire de l'Etat, dans quelle mesure la contribution des&#13;
familles permettrait-elle d'accroitre les effectifs scolaires? La reponse&#13;
a ces questions depend vraisemblablement des conditions propres a chaque&#13;
pays, et il va de soi que celles-ci constituent un facteur determinant&#13;
lorsqu'il s'agit de fixer le montant des contributions demandees pour&#13;
mobiliser les ressources des m6nages.&#13;
Le present document cherche a analyser ces differents elements dans&#13;
le cas particulier du Malawi. Les donnees utilisees se rapportent&#13;
essentiellement a l'enseignement primaire et secondaire.    Les elements&#13;
d'appreciation disponibles permettent de tirer les conclusions suivantes&#13;
i) il est peu probable qu'un relevement mod6r6 des droits de scolarite&#13;
entraine une forte deperdition d'effectifs parmi les eleves actuellement&#13;
inscrits (dans les etablissements primaires et secondaires). Par exemple,&#13;
si l'on augmente de 10 % des droits d'inscription moyens applicables aux&#13;
jeunes remplissant les conditions requises, le ratio des enfants&#13;
scolaris6s par m6nage ne diminue que de trois centiemes de point (0,58 a&#13;
0,55); ii) meme si la contribution demandee amene quelques 6leves a&#13;
abandonner leurs 6tudes, la demande excedentaire - notamment dans&#13;
l'enseignement secondaire - est suffisamment importante pour que l'on&#13;
puisse neanmoins enregistrer une augmentation effective du nombre des&#13;
inscrits, dans la mesure oui le relevement des droits de scolarite permet&#13;
d'accroitre le nombre de places offertes; et iii) l'augmentation des&#13;
droits de scolarit6 aura vraisemblablement une incidence plus importante&#13;
sur les familles a faible revenu; il faudrait donc prendre parallelement&#13;
des dispositions tendant a retablir une certaine 6quit6 en octroyant, par&#13;
exemple, un nombre limite de bourses dont l'attribution dependrait du&#13;
revenu familial et des resultats scolaires de l'eleve.&#13;

I.       Introduction&#13;
In 1973 Jallade (1973 p.l) expressed concern about an eventual crisis&#13;
in the financing of education in both developed and developing countries. A&#13;
decade later this crisis seems much closer, if not already at hand, for some&#13;
of the poorer nations.&#13;
The crisis emerges for the simple reason that the private demand for&#13;
education far outstrips the supply of education. The strong relationship&#13;
between education and earnings makes for a sustained demand for more and&#13;
better education. In effect it spells demand for higher and more costly&#13;
education, the corollary of which is an ever increasing pressure on&#13;
governments to expand educational financing. Democratization of education&#13;
serves only to exacerbate this pressure; the more access to education is&#13;
viewed as a basic right, the more expensive it is to finance as the right is&#13;
extended to those living in isolated areas.&#13;
Ideally both social demand 1/ and the noble goal of democratization&#13;
should be met. In the real world, however, education must compete for limited&#13;
public financial resources with a host of other economic activities of the&#13;
government, such as programs for poverty alieviation, health and housing.&#13;
This competition has become keener in recent years because the slow-down in&#13;
international economic activity has affected growth rates in many LDCs. In&#13;
this setting, substantial increases in public financing for education is&#13;
unlikely, not least because investments in the sector typically require longer&#13;
gestation than in other sectors.&#13;
In many respects Malawi's experience typifies the situation in many&#13;
LnCs.  First, the rapid growth in the demand for education which emerged with&#13;
1/ That is, the sum of individual private desire to acquire schooling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
the political and economic events in the fifties has continued unabated (See&#13;
Pike, 1968, pp. 214-217). Second, the sixties' goal of ensuring that all&#13;
primary school children complete their education has given way, since 1971, to&#13;
the goal of increasing access to at least primary education (see Nyasaland&#13;
Government, 1962, p. 55 and Malawi Government, 1971, p. 94). Third, in the&#13;
competition for limited public financial resources education appears to be&#13;
losing ground. The proportion of public expenditure allocated to education&#13;
has fallen sharply from 17 percent in 1970-71 to 12 percent in 1982-83. In&#13;
absolute terms the amount allocated to education has increased, but hardly&#13;
enough to match the increase in student enrollment, with the result that per&#13;
student expenditures, in constant terms, has not increased. 1/&#13;
The financial constraints have obviously imposed severe conditions in&#13;
the education sector, particularly at lower levels of schooling. In terms of&#13;
student numbers, Malawi's primary gross enrollment ratio in 1980 was only 59&#13;
percent compared to 78 percent on average in Africa, and 86 percent for all&#13;
LDCs (Unesco, 1982, Table 2.10). The secondary gross enrollment ratio was a&#13;
mere 4 percent compared to the African and LDC average of 21 percent and 31&#13;
percent respectively. Moreover, existing physical resources in schools are&#13;
being stretched to extreme limits, as is indicated, for example, by the&#13;
student-staff ratio. In no region of the country is this statistic below 56.4&#13;
for primary schooling 2/, a ratio that compares very unfavorably even with the&#13;
African average of 38.2 (Unesco, 1982). Perhaps the physical limitations&#13;
1/  Prior to the increase in school fees in 1982, per student expenditure in&#13;
constant prices remained unchanged at 14 kwachas at the primary level but&#13;
fell from 216 kwachas to 206 at the secondary level between 1980 and 1981.&#13;
2/  The primary student-staff raio is 56.4 for the North, 63.8 for the Central&#13;
Region, and 69.3 for the South.   If only qualified teachers are taken into&#13;
account, these ratios are even higher: 87.7 for the North, 100.6 for the&#13;
Central Region, and 111.7 for the South (Malawi Government, 1981).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
coupled with the tremendous social demand for schooling can be seen most&#13;
clearly from the picture painted by Heyneman (1980, pp. 14):&#13;
"...classrooms are dark and stuffy. Students are forced to squat on&#13;
the ground and write by balancing an exercise book or slate on their&#13;
knees. Teachers have no office; often no desk, and sometimes, not&#13;
even a chair. Student desks, if available, often wobble on three&#13;
legs; chairs have no backs; stools have but half a seat...only one&#13;
pupil in eight was found to have a seat at all; and only one in 88&#13;
had a desk."&#13;
The poor conditions in themselves nevertheless provide at best a weak&#13;
argument for increased allocation of public funds to the sector. A much&#13;
stronger argument emerges, however, when one considers the returns to&#13;
investment in the quality of education. These tend to be high because of the&#13;
complementarity of educational inputs, particularly when the initial&#13;
qualitative conditions are poor. Even in the absence of quality improvement,&#13;
the returns to investment in education are high. For example, Tan (1983b)&#13;
estimated that in Malawi, the social rate of return in 1983 was 18 percent for&#13;
primary schooling, 30 percent for lower secondary schooling; 27 percent for&#13;
upper secondary schooling; and 20 percent for university education. Echoing&#13;
the pattern characterizing most LDCs, all these rates exceed the 10 percent&#13;
yardstick commonly used to measure the opportunity cost of capital&#13;
(Psacharopoulos, 1981). Clearly, they indicate that investment in education&#13;
in Malawi is both economically justifiable and desirable.&#13;
However, additional government resources for the sector may not be&#13;
forthcoming, given current constraints in the public budget, and the&#13;
government's understandable desire for financial independence from external&#13;
sources (Malawi Government, 1971, pp. 5). Under these circumstances, it may&#13;
be necessary to generate the additional resources, or at least a part of them,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
from alternative sources. In recent discussions among policymakers and&#13;
researchers (Thobani, 1983; Eicher, 1984), user charges have featured&#13;
prominently as a means of tapping private household resources. Indeed in&#13;
Malawi school fees had been raised in 1982 by as much as 50 percent at most&#13;
levels; the new level of fees imply a recurrent cost recovery of 24 percent at&#13;
the primary level, and 38 percent at the secondary level (see Tables A.1 and&#13;
A.2).&#13;
Despite the large recent increases in fees, the financial needs and&#13;
constraints of the education sector in Malawi are so great that they prompt&#13;
the question of whether or not further fee increases can be imposed. The&#13;
answer clearly rests on the willingness and ability of households to bear or&#13;
accept further increases. At first sight, it would seem that households are&#13;
probably unable to pay more, since it may be argued that current enrollments&#13;
in Malawi are low precisely because families cannot even afford existing&#13;
fees. Low enrollment, however, is not necessarily explained by inability to&#13;
pay because in the case of Malawi, it reflects mainly the short supply of&#13;
places. At the existing level of fees, there is in fact excess demand for&#13;
education. Furthermore, it may be added that even if families are poor, they&#13;
are not reluctant to finance their children's education through borrowing.&#13;
Thus, although the Northern Region of the country is the poorest and least&#13;
developed, (World Bank, 1982, pp. 138; see also Pike, 1968; and Malawi&#13;
Government, 1971), it boasts higher enrollment rates than the Central and&#13;
Southern Regions. 1/ Given this context, in assessing whether or not&#13;
additional resources from private households can be tapped via further&#13;
increases in user charges, this paper focuses more on evaluating their&#13;
willingness to pay.&#13;
1/ The primary enrollment ratio in 1980 was 85 percent in the North, 54&#13;
percent in the Central Region and 49 percent in the South (World Bank,&#13;
1982, pp. 169).-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
To simplify, the willingness to pay concept involves two main&#13;
considerations: the responsiveness of the demand for schooling to increases&#13;
in the private cost burden, and the existence of excess demand at a given&#13;
level of private cost. The steeper the demand curve, the less likely&#13;
households are to withdraw their children from school when fees are raised.&#13;
At the same time, the larger the difference between the demand for schooling&#13;
and the supply of places (excess demand) the more readily are households to&#13;
accept an increase in fees. In the aggregate, if households are willing to&#13;
pay for education, an increase in fees linked with a simultaneous increase in&#13;
the supply of places is more likely to lead to an expansion in overall&#13;
enrollment rather than a decline. The fee increase would not affect&#13;
substantially the enrollment of those already in'school, but it would generate&#13;
additional resources to provide places that would obviously be readily taken&#13;
up by those not currently enrolled.&#13;
The purpose of this study is to provide an assessment of the private&#13;
household willingness to pay for education. As in other analyses of this&#13;
nature, the willingness to pay is difficul.t to measure directly; our&#13;
evaluation thus relies on indirect evidence . These are presented below as&#13;
follows. Section II describes the data which form the main basis of our&#13;
analysis. Section III takes an indepth look at the existing levels and&#13;
patterns of schooling expenditures that primary and secondary students already&#13;
incur. Section IV contains a preliminary analysis of willingness to pay as&#13;
indicated by students' assessment of whether or not they would continue&#13;
schooling if they had to pay higher fees. Section V analyzes actual household&#13;
enrollment responses to the burden of educational expenses, while Section VI&#13;
further evaluates the willingness to pay for education by analyzing how&#13;
families currently finance their children's education, and also private school&#13;
attendance. Section VII provides an economic rationale for this willingness&#13;

discusses their implications for user charges as a means of cost recovery.&#13;
II.      Data and Sample Characteristics&#13;
The data were raised in a March 1983 World Bank survey of 2000&#13;
Standard VIII pupils, and 500 Form II and 500 Form IV students in nine&#13;
secondary schools. The sample represents approximately 2.8% of the universe&#13;
of primary school pupils; and 6% of all secondary school pupils. 1/    Quota&#13;
sampling was used to ensure adequate representation by sex, school types and&#13;
region in the secondary school sample.   For the primary school sample, the&#13;
main sampling criterion was regional representativeness; beyond this, primary&#13;
students were selected from clusters of schools which were within a thirty&#13;
mile radius of the areas in which secondary school students were sampled. A&#13;
wider geographical coverage was unfeasible due to the practical difficulties&#13;
of coordination and travel to more distant schools.&#13;
The survey questionnaires raised information in the following areas:&#13;
(i) pupils' family background; (ii) the private cost of attending school;&#13;
(iii) expected and foregone earnings (only for secondary students); (iv)&#13;
students' responses to contingency questions on hypothetical fee increases;&#13;
and (iv) the number of respondents' siblings who are currently in school.&#13;
These data are useful for the purpose of our study, but several&#13;
problems in using information provided by students should be noted. In the&#13;
first place, the survey provides information only on those already in school.&#13;
It contains no information on those of school age who were not enrolled at the&#13;
time of the survey, thus introducing the problem of selectivity bias.&#13;
1/ See Appendix Table A.3 for distribution of the universe and sample&#13;
populations of primary and secondary students.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
However, since the data include information on students' siblings and their&#13;
enrollment status, they provide an indirect source of information on those who&#13;
are not enrolled. This information in fact permits analysis at the household&#13;
rather than individual level and improves considerably our understanding of&#13;
household behavior toward schooling. Thus this selectivity bias in fact poses&#13;
no serious problem for the analysis below.&#13;
A second area of possible shortcoming is data accuracy, particularly&#13;
where the survey question requires an answer that one would not normally&#13;
expect a student to know easily; a prime example is father's income. But the&#13;
problem of income data accuracy is also known to exist where information has&#13;
been provided by household heads, although it probably arises for reasons&#13;
other than ignorance. In our sample, the income variable is highly correlated&#13;
with family asset ownership, which is presumably more accurately reflected in&#13;
students' responses. Given this correlation, we have used income and asset&#13;
ownership interchangeably as proxies for family wealth.&#13;
A third and perhaps more serious shortcoming is the fact that&#13;
students' responses may not represent the views of their families, or of those&#13;
who provide the financial support for their schooling. These views are&#13;
particularly important in the context of this paper's analysis, since the&#13;
focus is on households' willingness to pay for education services. In this&#13;
regard, a household survey would have been preferable; in its absence, we urge&#13;
our readers to exercise the necessary caution in interpreting the results.&#13;

III.     Patterns of Private Schooling Expenditure&#13;
Although public education is heavily subsidized in Malawi, households&#13;
do incur costs when they send children to school. Apart from opportunity&#13;
costs, 1/ considerable direct cash outlays are involved. The data indicate&#13;
that in government schools these outlays amounted to K41 p.a. (US$43) for&#13;
Standard VIII pupils in 1983, and K220 p.a. (US$231) for secondary pupils.&#13;
The corresponding cost for secondary pupils in aided schools was about the&#13;
same, but it was much higher for those attending private school, amounting to&#13;
K355 p.a. (US$372). In the context of Malawi's 1981 per capita income of&#13;
US$200 (see World Bank, 1983) these levels of expenditure must be considered&#13;
high. They represented 8 percent of the average level of father's income&#13;
reported by pupils in the primary school sample; and about 25 percent that&#13;
reported among secondary school pupils.&#13;
The itemized breakdown of students' expenditure appear in Table 1.&#13;
For all students, the table shows that fees are only a part of their total&#13;
expenses. For example, substantial amounts are spent on school attire,&#13;
transport and incidentals. The high expenditure on uniforms and shoes&#13;
compared to more directly pedagogical items, such as books and supplies, bhas&#13;
been observed for other developing countries (Stromquist, 1982; Tan, 1983a).&#13;
It is perhaps a reflection of the fact that (officially-specified) attire is&#13;
often a prerequisite for enrollment whereas books are not. Thus when poverty&#13;
limits what families can afford to spend on schooling, there is a natural&#13;
tendency to spend only on those items that are institutionally required.&#13;
1/ Although this paper does not focus on opportunity costs, we note that&#13;
these can be substantial for older students in school, particularly in&#13;
rural areas. See, for example, Cain (1977) for a detailed account of the&#13;
agricultural labor of children in Bangladesh.&#13;

However, in a situation where the government does not have the financial&#13;
capacity to compensate for the shortfall in expenditures on items directly&#13;
related to school quality, it would be appropriate to reconsider the current&#13;
policy (perhaps tacit) of requiring uniforms over books. That policy can&#13;
effect a change in the private allocation of financial resources in the&#13;
desired direction is seen in the (more balanced) pattern of expenditure among&#13;
privately-enrolled secondary students; they spend on average K22 on uniforms&#13;
and shoes and K12 on books, compared to K37 and K7 for corresponding items&#13;
among state or aided school students.&#13;
Expenditure on transport is substantially higher among secondary than&#13;
primary students. This is due mainly to the relative scarcity of secondary&#13;
schools, which requires many secondary students to enroll in schools away from&#13;
home. Privately-enrolled secondary students incur the highest transport&#13;
costs, probably reflecting the fact that there is only one private secondary&#13;
school in Malawi and its students are drawn from all parts of the country.&#13;
Variation in the expenditure of students in different sample&#13;
sub-groups is shown in Table 2. For example, females tend to spend more; the&#13;
main item accounting for the difference being incidentals. The expenditure of&#13;
boarding secondary students is expectedly higher than day students' because of&#13;
higher transportation costs. For the same reason, students attending schools&#13;
located away from their home region incur a higher expenditure. In terms of&#13;
socio-economic background, students from richer homes generally tend to spend&#13;
more, although it is not always true that those who come from the most&#13;
disadvantaged backgrounds spend least. Since the poorest students are likely&#13;
to come from remote rural areas, their higher expenditure is possibly a&#13;
reflection of the higher cost of attending school far away from home.&#13;
Finally, it is interesting to note from Table 2 that there is a positive&#13;
correlation between the number of persons providing financial support for&#13;

schooling, and the reported expenditure. If one assumes that schooling&#13;
expenditures are largely exogenously determined, as for example in the case of&#13;
Tanzania (Tan, 1983a), then the correlation implies that as the required&#13;
outlay increases, a student depends increasingly on more than one member of&#13;
his or her (extended) family for financial support.&#13;
Although Table 2 provided some useful insights, the comparisons that&#13;
it permits are at best only suggestive in the absence of standardization for&#13;
all factors which might have influenced differences between the sub-groups.&#13;
Furthermore, it does not distinguish between factors that are important as&#13;
determinants of students' schooling expenditure, and those that are not. To&#13;
overcome these shortcomings, we turn to regression analysis, using two&#13;
dependent variables: a) total non-fee expenditure which covers expenses on&#13;
textbooks, stationery, uniforms and transport; and b) total expenditure which&#13;
is the sum total of non-fee expenditure and all forms of schooling fees. The&#13;
independent variables have been chosen on the basis of a priori arguments and&#13;
the bivariate results discussed above. A full description of all the&#13;
variables appear in Appendix Table A.4.&#13;
The OLS estimates appear in Table 3. In general, the results confirm&#13;
a priori expectations. First, in the case of primary schooling the&#13;
significant determinants of non-fee expenditure are the location of the school&#13;
(South), father's income and the pupil's own earned income (equation 1). All&#13;
the coefficients have the expected signs. The largest single determinant is&#13;
the pupil's own earned income. Almost 55 percent of the primary school pupils&#13;
are engaged in some form of paid labor during their free time but of these&#13;
over 99 percent are pupils beyond the normal schooling age of 5-12 years.&#13;
Father's annual income, not surprisingly, contributes significantly towards&#13;
the pupil's annual non-fee expenditure. The positive correlation coefficients&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Central - of which only one is significant can be explained by the fact that&#13;
the North is the poorest region. Also, contrary to the usual pattern in which&#13;
school availability is positively correlated with income, there are fewer&#13;
schools in the South and Central regions (see Heyneman 1972). Thus the higher&#13;
expenditures of students in schools located in these regions may also be due&#13;
to their higher cost of travelling to school.&#13;
Turning to the determinants of total schooling expenditure (equation&#13;
2, Table 3) only three variables exert a significant influence; father's&#13;
annual income, the number of siblings in school, and sex. The positive&#13;
significance of father's annual income is self-explanatory but the negative&#13;
significance of the latter two variables calls for some explanation.&#13;
Regression analysis at this stage deals only with total expenses&#13;
incurred by the individual student. In this context the negative effect of&#13;
the number of siblings is due to several factors. First, for a given&#13;
household income, although the absolute sum allocated to education is higher&#13;
the larger the number of siblings in school, the average expenditure per child&#13;
can be lower since the total amount allocated to education must be shared&#13;
between a larger number of siblings. Second, there may be economies of scale&#13;
in schooling expenditure. It is possible for school-going children in the&#13;
same household to share schooling items such as textbooks and uniforms.&#13;
Third, for a given household income, under Malawi's open system where no one&#13;
is compelled to pay the full sum of schooling fees, parents are likely to pay&#13;
less the more children they have in school. Judging by the large increase in&#13;
the absolute value of the coefficient when school fees are included as part of&#13;
total expenditure the third explanation may be of particular importance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Males also incur significantly less expenditure on schooling than&#13;
females, consistent with findings elsewhere (Tan, 1983a). This result may&#13;
also be attributed to the fact that a high proportion of those repeating&#13;
Standard VIII - overall repetition rate was 43 percent in 1980 (Unesco, 1982,&#13;
p. 111-51) - are males. Since they are not compelled to pay the full amount&#13;
of the school fees many are likely to repeat without doing so.&#13;
In the regressions for secondary school pupils, privately-enrolled&#13;
students have been excluded because of the very small number of valid&#13;
observations. For the remaining students, two sets of equations are presented&#13;
for each of the dependent variables, one with the dummy variable "Boarding"&#13;
and the other with the dummy variable "Aided". Due to the small number of&#13;
schools represented in the sample, these two dummy variables could not be&#13;
included in the same regression because of multi-collinearity problems. For&#13;
the same reason, the school location variables have been dropped. Further,&#13;
instead of using "Age" as in the primary school regressions, we have used&#13;
"Form IV" to distinguish between older and younger students.&#13;
The two sets of equations yield similar results. In terms of non-fee&#13;
expenditure, the only significant variable is the dummy variable representing&#13;
urban residence (equations 3 and 4, Table 3). The negative correlation can be&#13;
explained by differences in the availability and proximity of secondary&#13;
schools between urban and rural centres. Secondary schools are mainly located&#13;
in urban centers. In rural areas pupils are required to travel longer&#13;
distances and they, naturally, incur higher transportation costs. In general,&#13;
most of the other coefficients have the expected signs, but these are all not&#13;
statistically significant. However, the coefficient on the "Male" dummy&#13;
variable deserves some further explanation. In regression 3, its values is&#13;
-16.33 compared to -1.39 in regression 4. This large difference arises from&#13;
the choice of either "Boarding School" or "Aided School" to describe the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
school attended. The instability is probably related to the fact that&#13;
subsamples defined accordingly have sex-ratios which differ significantly.&#13;
In terms of total schooling expenditure, the two sets of equations&#13;
also give rise to similar results (equations 5 and 6, Table 3). However, in&#13;
this case none of the coefficients are significant though most have the&#13;
expected signs. The dummy variable representing urban residence is still&#13;
inversely correlated with schooling expenditure but it is no longer&#13;
significant even at the 10 percent level. It is interesting to note that&#13;
while economies of scale and other factors permit, in large families, a&#13;
reduction in the per child expenditure for primary schooling, these&#13;
considerations do not exert a similar effect at the secondary level. 1/&#13;
In the entire set of six OLS equations the results generally confirm&#13;
a priori expectations. However, the most striking feature of the results lies&#13;
in the very low values of the coefficients of determination, R ; in no case&#13;
does the R2 reach 10 percent. It implies that the personal characteristics&#13;
of the pupil, the characteristics of the school, the socio-economic or family&#13;
background of the pupil, and the financing circumstances of the pupil&#13;
collectively do not significantly affect the level of schooling expenditure.&#13;
For both primary and secondary schooling, given that educational expenditure&#13;
can take up as much as 20 percent of household income and the generally low&#13;
income levels in Malawi, it is not surprising that parents, whatever their&#13;
socio-economic status, do not spend much more or much less than that which is&#13;
determined by external circumstances.&#13;
1/ Family size, and number of siblings of schooling age do not differ&#13;
significantly between the primary and secondary samples.&#13;

IV.      Continuation Rates Under Hypothetical Future Fee Increases&#13;
To assess the likely reaction to yet higher fees, the sample students&#13;
were asked to evaluate whether or not they would remain in school after some&#13;
hypothetical increases in school fees. 1/ It should be emphasized that, in&#13;
the absence of household data, their answers serve only as a guide to actual&#13;
outcomes since, as argued above, it is the household rather than the student&#13;
that represents the decision-making unit.&#13;
Table 4 shows how changes in the school fees at state or aided&#13;
school, ceteris paribus, might affect the decision of students to continue or&#13;
terminate schooling at the current level of education. These are contingency&#13;
responses (which may not coincide with the actual behavior) to fee increases&#13;
ranging from about 48% to 640% at the primary level, and from 33% to 567% at&#13;
the secondary level.&#13;
For all students, the proportion expecting to continue schooling at&#13;
the current levels declines consistently with progressive increases in school&#13;
fees. The effect is clearly larger at the secondary school level where&#13;
existing fees are four and one-half times as high as at the primary school&#13;
level. Looking at it from another viewpoint, with full recurrent cost&#13;
recovery at the secondary level (266 kwachas per student in 1981/82) 90&#13;
percent of the students indicated that they would stop schooling. A similar&#13;
cost recovery at the primary level (16.3 kwachas per student in 1981/82) shows&#13;
a 'drop-out' rate of between 25 to 40 percent. Given the nature of the data,&#13;
however, these high rates should be taken only as indicative signs of the&#13;
impact of higher user charges, rather than as predictions of actual dropout&#13;
rates associated with the higher charges.&#13;

/1  In 1983 the tuition fee for standard VIII pupils in rural primary schools was R6 p.a.; and K7.5 p.a. in urban&#13;
schools (See Table A.1).    The percentage increase in fees is calculated on the basis of the average fee, that&#13;
is, 16.76 p.a.   The fee in state secondary schools was K30 p.a. in 1983.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The likelihood of continuing school following each successive&#13;
hypothetical increase in fees varies according to sample subgroup&#13;
characteristics. For example, it is higher among non-repeaters and students&#13;
who aspire to further education. Table 4 also shows that there are&#13;
significant differences across family backgrounds. The proportion likely to&#13;
continue is higher among students with better educated parents, students for&#13;
high-asset ownership backgrounds, students from urban centers, primary&#13;
students living in the more developed central and southern regions of Malawi,&#13;
and secondary students living in the northern region where the private school&#13;
is located. In general, these differences can be explained in terms of&#13;
opportunity costs and expected returns but, perhaps, more so in terms of&#13;
differences in parental expectations and family income or wealth.&#13;
The contingency responses of students also vary according to how&#13;
their education is financed. The chances of continuing school following a fee&#13;
increase is higher among those whose education is financed by their fathers,&#13;
than among those relying on other family sources. However, the likelihood of&#13;
continuing does not vary systematically with whether or not more than one&#13;
relative provide the financial support. As one might expect, the largest&#13;
difference in the chances of continuing is between those who rely on family&#13;
resources and those who rely on external (non-family) funds. Clearly, in&#13;
evaluating their position, students recognize than some sources of financing&#13;
are more reliable than others.&#13;
In order to examine the relative impact of educational, family, and&#13;
financing factors on the likelihood of continuing schooling, regression&#13;
analysis was used to extend the bivariate analysis discussed above.&#13;
Contingency responses to successive fee increases at the primary and secondary&#13;
levels here imply a 0-1 dependent variable representing whether or not a&#13;
student expects to continue schooling at the corresponding new levels of&#13;

Ln [P/(l-P)] = a + X B&#13;
or (1)                P = 1/[l + e  - (a + X&#13;

regression constant; B, a vector of regression coefficients; and X, a vector&#13;

particular attention was focused on the economic resources available to the&#13;
student - father's annual income, and the dependence of the student on&#13;
external loans. Equation (1) is estimated by maximum likelihood techniques to&#13;
obtain asymtotically efficient and consistent parameter estimates.&#13;
The regression results appear in Table 5. Their most striking&#13;
feature lies in the "right" sign and persistent significance of the economic&#13;
resource variable. In all the estimated equations, father's annual income has&#13;
the expected positive influence on the probability of continuing schooling,&#13;
while dependence on external loans exerts the expected negative influence. In&#13;
the primary school sample, the strength of the income variable declines with&#13;
each successive increase in user charge, whereas in the other sample, the&#13;
opposite is true. An explanation for this difference lies in the fact that&#13;
the secondary sample differs significantly from the primary sample in terms of&#13;
family background composition; in particular, it contains students largely&#13;
from higher income families. 2/ At successive increases in fees, the&#13;
1/ See (Amemiya, 1981) for a description of the model's statistical&#13;
properties and examples of its applications.&#13;
2/ In the secondary sample, mean father's annual income was K1390, with&#13;
standard deviation of K1960; in the primary sample, the corresponding&#13;
statistics were K550 and K710.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

perceived financial burden is large enough to reduce socio-economic difference&#13;
within the primary sample, whereas in the other sample, these differences are&#13;
enhanced. For both primary and secondary students, however, the influence of&#13;
dependence on external loans declines as fees are hypothetically raised. This&#13;
result implies that with higher fees, even students who do not currently&#13;
borrow would be affected.&#13;
The other factors which are statistically significant, and which have&#13;
the expected signs include, for the primary sample regressions, sex and&#13;
aspiration to the next level of education; and for the secondary sample&#13;
regressions, sex and repeater status. Males have a greater probability of&#13;
terminating schooling than females, ceteris paribus, possibly, reflecting&#13;
their higher opportunity cost of schooling. The coefficient of the variable&#13;
"aspire to next level of educations" is positive, but does not vary in a&#13;
consistent pattern as fees are raised. This result may be due to the small&#13;
number of pupils not aspiring to higher levels of education in the primary&#13;
sample (N=55). Repeaters in secondary school are less likely than&#13;
non-repeaters to continue schooling at each level of hypothetical user charge,&#13;
but the coefficient becomes statistically insignificant beyond the K60 level.&#13;
This result is not unexpected. Repeaters are likely to feel the "pinch" of&#13;
fee increases more than non-repeaters, since they are already experiencing a&#13;
higher loss in foregone earings, but as the amount by which fees are&#13;
hypothetically raised is increased, both groups would ceteris paribus, be&#13;
equally affected.&#13;
Apart from the coefficients of the independent variables, another&#13;
striking result is the decline in the fit of the regressions for both&#13;
samples. The D-value, which is approximately the equivalent of R2 in OLS&#13;
regressions (Harrell, 1980), declines from 0.08 to a mere 0.04 in the primary&#13;

school sample, and from 0.22 to 0.11 in the secondary school sample. Clearly,&#13;
the independent variables used here do not explain completely the decision to&#13;
continue or to terminate schooling at successively higher levels of user&#13;
charge. Other factors such as school quality, and peer-group influence may be&#13;
important but cannot be accounted for in this study. Nevertheless, the two&#13;
important findings so far are: a) the proportion likely to drop-out due to a&#13;
rise in school fees increases with successive increases in school fees; and b)&#13;
the likelihood of continuing schooling in the face of higher school fees, and&#13;
therefore the willingness to pay, varies directly with socio-economic&#13;
background.&#13;
V.       Willingness to pay:   Evidence From Household Enrollment Behavior&#13;
Although the discussion above provides some useful indications of the&#13;
enrollment impact of future fee increases, we cannot place too much confidence&#13;
on the results. Not only do the data reflect what are at best guesses, they&#13;
are also obtained from students whose opinions may not necessarily reflect&#13;
their parents' views. In analysing willingness to pay, it is probably more&#13;
appropriate to use the family or household as the basic decision-making unit&#13;
for several reasons. First, the individual student of primary, and even&#13;
secondary, school age is often too young to make such decisions on his/her own&#13;
behalf. Second, since the individual student is often not the only child of&#13;
school-going age in the family decisions on education must be made within the&#13;
family or household context. This is particularly relevant in developing&#13;
countries where more education for an eligible child often means less or no&#13;
education for another. Moreover, it is the family or household rather than&#13;
the individual that provides the financial support for education. 1/&#13;
1/ The appropriateness of the household decision-making framework has also&#13;
bee emphasized elsewhere; see for instance Birdsall and Cochrane (1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
In practical terms, the question of whether or not households are&#13;
willing to pay for education can be stated as follows: given that there are&#13;
certain direct private costs associated with the education of a child, to what&#13;
extent is the proportion of eligible children enrolled influenced by such cost&#13;
considerations? A related question is, if the financial burden is increased,&#13;
for example, as a result of fee increases, would the household enrollment&#13;
ratio drop, and by how much?&#13;
To attempt answering these questions, we estimate an equation based&#13;
on the assumption that the household maximizes a utility function which has,&#13;
as one of its "commodities", the proportion of eligible children enrolled in&#13;
school (P). Within this framework, the objective would be to educate all&#13;
eligible children. However, the household faces a budget constraint, and is&#13;
forced to allocate its resources between education and all other "commodities"&#13;
which feature in its utility function. In the short-run, the household cannot&#13;
alter the number of children eligible for schooling, nor its budget. Thus the&#13;
household makes a decision on P based partly on an assessment of the burden it&#13;
would have to bear if all eligible children were to be enrolled, given its&#13;
budget constraint and other socioeconomic background factors which&#13;
circumscribe its tastes and aspirations. It should be emphasized here that&#13;
the hypothesized relationship is not a demand function in the usual sense of a&#13;
price-quantity relationship. Rather, it is more appropriately viewed as a&#13;
household enrollment ratio function showing how the perceived total financial&#13;
burden of schooling affects households' actual decisions about the proportion&#13;
of its eligible children who will be enrolled.&#13;
In the empirical analysis, we estimate a linear approximation of the&#13;
function using OLS. In particular:&#13;
(2)      P = a + Bt. Ln(X ) +      B..X.&#13;
t      t        .   1.i  i&#13;
i# t&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

where P is the proportion of eligible children enrolled in school (household&#13;
enrollment ratio); Xt is the financial burden associated with enrollment of&#13;
all eligible children; and X   is the i   variable in a vector representing&#13;
the influences of socioeconomic background and the household's budget&#13;
constraint. 1/ Xt has two components: fees only and other schooling&#13;
expenses..&#13;
Most of the regression variables are readily available from the data&#13;
gathered in our survey of primary and secondary pupils. However, the data on&#13;
P and X had to be constructed from the information provided by the&#13;
t&#13;
students. For each pupil, we know his/her age, the number of older and&#13;
younger siblings, and the number of siblings in school. Assuming a given&#13;
birth inteval, it is possible to derive the number of children in the&#13;
students' family who are in the age interval 5 to 23; 2/ siblings in this age&#13;
interval are considered to be eligible for schooling. Thus P is given by&#13;
(3)      P   (No. siblings in school)/(No. siblings in age interval 5-23).&#13;
To construct Xt, we first obtain the ages of the pupil's siblings&#13;
based on the same birth spacing assumption. The cost of each sibling's&#13;
education, given his/her age, is obtained by multiplying the likelihood of&#13;
being in one of three education levels, primary, lower and upper&#13;
1/ Alternative specifications were experimented with, but in general the&#13;
results were inferior; for example the R2 value was lower when the&#13;
following equation was estimated:&#13;
P = a + Bt,l .Xt + Bt,2 .X2 + Z Bi.Xi&#13;
See also Appendix A for a comparison with the following form:&#13;
Ln [P/(l-P)] = a + Bt.Ln(Xt) + Z Bi.Xi&#13;

Table 6 reports the regression results based on the assumption of&#13;
one-year birth spacing between siblings. The independent variables used are&#13;
defined in Appendix Table A.4. In general, the results confirm a priori&#13;
expectations. Moreover, they remain largely unaffected when the one-year&#13;
birth spacing assumption is changed to two years, and three years. These&#13;
sensitivity results are reported in Appendix Table A.5. As indicated in the&#13;
methodological note in Appendix A, there are theoretical reasons to suspect&#13;
the existence of heteroscedasticity in the regressions. As it turns out,&#13;
however, this is not a very important problem in the sample. This assessment&#13;
has been checked using the two-step weighted least squares method (Aitken's&#13;
generalized least squares method), which shows that the value and statistical&#13;
significance of the regression coefficients remain largely unaffected after&#13;
correcting for heteroscedasticity. For example, the coefficient of Ln(Total&#13;
1/ This likelihood distribution is derived from the 1976 National Census.&#13;
The advantage of using the national probabilities is that it indirectly&#13;
allows for the fact that enrollment at any level of education depends on&#13;
the student having passed the previous level.&#13;

Fees) charges from -0.30 to -0.22 in equation (C) of Table 6, both co-&#13;
efficients being statistically significant at 1 percent.&#13;
Focussing on equations (A) to (C) in Table 6, the most interesting&#13;
finding is that the cost burden exerts a negative and statistically&#13;
significant effect (at the 1 percent level) on household enrollment. From the&#13;
construction of Xt in equation (4) above, it is possible that the effect is&#13;
due entirely to variations in the number of eligible children in each&#13;
household, and their age composition. However, when the influence of cost&#13;
is excluded by assuming a uniform cost for all educational levels in&#13;
calculating X , the corresponding regressions had lower R 's; for example,&#13;
the latter statistic dropped from .0.22 to 0.18 for regression (C) in&#13;
Table 6. This experiment provides indirect evidence confirming that, apart&#13;
from household size and age composition, the existing cost structure&#13;
is also an important influence determining the actual number of eligible&#13;
children that households enroll.&#13;
Other variables which are statistically significant at the 10 percent&#13;
level, or better include family background characteristics such as mother's&#13;
education, urban-rural and Northern residence, ana proportion of girls among&#13;
the household's children. Not surprisingly, the proportion of children in&#13;
school is higher in households with better educated mothers, and the effect is&#13;
reinforced in urban 'ouseholds. The influence of father's income has the&#13;
expected positive sign, but is statistically significant only in equation&#13;
(C).  Residence in the Northern region is associated with higher enrollment&#13;
ratios, possibly reflecting the educational tradition in this part of the&#13;
country (see Heyneman, 1972). However, the effect is present mostly in the&#13;
primary sample, which consists of households more likely to have children of&#13;
primary school age. In the secondary sample, where the children, are older,&#13;
the absence of this effect is possibly a reflection of the poorer access to&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

secondary schooling in the North. The regressions also show that the higher&#13;
the proportion of girls, the lower is the household enrollment ratio. This&#13;
negative association, while negligible for primary schooling, is relatively&#13;
large, and statistically significant for secondary schooling, as a comparison&#13;
of equations (A) and (B) in Table 6 indicates. The lower access of girls to&#13;
secondary schooling is confirmed by the national statistics (Malawi&#13;
Government, 1981) which show that whereas girls form 41 percent of total&#13;
primary enrollment, they represent only 29 percent of secondary enrollment.&#13;
Turning to equations (D) and (E) in which the dependent variable is&#13;
Ln [P/(1-P)] 1/ instead of P, it is apparent that this alternative&#13;
specification does not alter the results discussed above, although for&#13;
methodological reasons elaborated in Appendix A, the specification of&#13;
equations (A) to (C) is preferable.&#13;
In the absence of direct measures, the willingness of households to&#13;
bear additional financial burden for their children's education can only be&#13;
assessed indirectly. The regression estimates above, based on cross-sectional&#13;
data, provide a fair approximation to the time-series behavior of households&#13;
in response to an increase in the financial burden. The weaker is the&#13;
relationship between actual enrollment and total financial burden facing the&#13;
household, the smaller would be the drop in enrollment following a rise in the&#13;
cost of education to the household, or, correspondingly, the greater its&#13;
willingness to accept the cost increase. To summarize this relationship, we&#13;
define an elasticity statistic 2/ which is given as the percentage decline in&#13;
1/  The estimated equation is thus Ln [P/(l-P)] = a + Bt.Ln(Xt) +      Bi.Xi&#13;

the proportion of eligible children enrolled following a one percentage&#13;
rise in the total fees associated with enrolling all eligible children in&#13;
the household, or equivalently, a one percentage rise in the average fees&#13;
to enroll each eligible child. Table 6 shows that in all the regressions,&#13;
the estimated value of this elasticity statistic is around -0.5. The&#13;
meaning of an elasticity of this magnitude can be illustrated as follows:&#13;
at the sample means of total cost (k439) and household enrollment ratio&#13;
(0.58), a 20 percent increase in cost implies that the household enrollment&#13;
ratio would decline to 0.52. Thus the regression results suggest that,&#13;
ceteris paribus, the negative impact of moderate fee increases on household&#13;
enrollment is quite small. Moreover, since fees are only about one-eighth&#13;
of total schooling costs, increases in this element of private costs would&#13;
probably not reduce enrollment substantially.&#13;

The simulations in Table 7 show the implication of different levels&#13;
of secondary school fees on household enrollment, keeping constant fees for&#13;
primary schooling and all other costs. We concentrate on fees for secondary&#13;
schooling as the potential for charging higher fees for this level of&#13;
education appears to be greater compared to primary education. 1/ In a&#13;
household context, it is likely that the raising of fees for one level of&#13;
education may affect the enrollment status of siblings at other levels of&#13;
schooling. The results of the simulations confirm, however, that not many of&#13;
the students currently enrolled, either in primary or secondary schools, would&#13;
drop out following an increase in secondary school fees.&#13;
We turn now to examine the impact of fee increases on overall&#13;
enrollment. We shall again concentrate only on fee increase for secondary&#13;
schooling. The elasticity estimate discussed above can be used to derive the&#13;
slope of the demand curve. An estimate of the excess demand 2/ for secondary&#13;
schooling allows us to simulate its location in a fee-enrollment plane.&#13;
Assuming that additional revenues from fees are used by the government&#13;
to expand the provision of secondary education, the effective&#13;
1/ For example, the private rates of return to secondary schooling is much&#13;
higher that for primary schooling, as we show later in this report.&#13;
2/ The extent of excess demand was estimated according to the following&#13;
statistics (Malawi government, 1981) and assumptions: in 1979/80,&#13;
65,007 students were enrolled in Standard VIII, of whom 59,434 sat for&#13;
their PSLC examination. 43,767 passed, and of these 5,260 proceeded to&#13;
Form I. The number who did not sit for the PSLC examination was&#13;
therefore 5,573, and the number who failed in the examination was&#13;
15,667. In 1980/81, the number of repeaters in Standard VIII was 30,559.&#13;
Assuming that all those who did not sit and all who failed the PSLC&#13;
examination in 1979/80 repeated standard VIII in 1980/81, the number of&#13;
repeaters who already have their PSLC is 9,319 (30559 - 15667 - 5573).&#13;
This figure is obviously an under-estimate of the number of PSLC holders&#13;
who are seeking admission in secondary school. Based on this conservative&#13;
estimate, only one-third of the expressed demand for secondary education&#13;
is satisfied. In other words, at the current level of fees, the expressed&#13;
demand is 50,000 whereas the current provision is for only 17,000 students&#13;

characteristics of secondary education in Malawi are represented by points&#13;

(Point B). :When fees are increased, the potential aggregate demand&#13;
diminishes, while the possible provision of places increases. The graph&#13;
shows that it would be necessary to increase the fees up to K173 p.a. to&#13;
reach a situation where demand is exactly matched by the supply of places.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
With this increase in fees, the overall realized enrollment would increase&#13;
from 17,000 to 41,600. In the extreme situation where the provision of&#13;
places is kept at 17,000, it is likely that fees as high as the full cost&#13;
recovery level of K266 p.a. would not cause any decline in the current&#13;
aggregate level of secondary enrollment in Malawi.&#13;
In the foregoing analysis, we have been concerned only with the&#13;
aggregate size of enrollment. The raising of fees is also likely to affect&#13;
equity in that poorer students may have to withdraw from school. As a&#13;
result, their representation in the increased student population of 22,600&#13;
may be lower than before. To mitigate this adverse effect, it would be&#13;
necessary to provide needy and deserving students with scholarships or&#13;
bursaries. These schemes could conceivably be financed from the additional&#13;
resources from higher fees.&#13;
Another factor that is not explicitly considered is variation in&#13;
school quality which may have an impact on enrollment decision. 1/ However&#13;
this variable is unlikely to change in the short run since it takes time to&#13;
improve school quality; but if improvements do occur in the short run, they&#13;
would reduce further the already low elasticity of household enrollment&#13;
with respect to fee increases.&#13;
The simulations in Figure 1 depend basically on the empirical&#13;
results of the household enrollment model which showed that families would&#13;
be unlikely to withdraw their children from school when fees are raised.&#13;
The validity of the low responsiveness of enrollment to fees can be&#13;
documented by other pieces of evidence to which we now turn in Section VI&#13;
below.&#13;

VI.      Further Evidence on the Willingness to Pay&#13;
a)   Sources of Private Financing and Dropout Rates&#13;
In April 1982 the Malawian Government increased user charges in both&#13;
primary and secondary schools. Primary school fees in rural areas were raised&#13;
by 50 percent, and in urban centres by 43 percent in grades 1-5 and 15 percent&#13;
in grades 6-8. Secondary school fees went up by 50 percent while boarding&#13;
charges in grant-aided and boarding schools were raised by 150 percent (see&#13;
Table A.1).&#13;
Central to the issues here are two basic questions: a) what are the&#13;
sources of educational financing for the pupil, and b) what had been the&#13;
effects of the rise in user charges on attendance and educational financing.&#13;
The answers to these two questions clearly differ between socio-economic&#13;
groups. To provide a clearer picture the samples have been divided into two&#13;
groups - high asset and low asset. High asset group pupils come from families&#13;
with at least a motorized vehicle (scooter, car or truck) while the low asset&#13;
group pupils come from families without any motorized vehicle ownership. The&#13;
former accounts for 13 percent of the primary school sample, and 26 percent of&#13;
the secondary school sample.&#13;
Table 8 provides a summary of the data relating to the two basic&#13;
questions. Educational financing in Malawi, at the primary and secondary&#13;
levels, comes essentially from within the family, within the extended family&#13;
system, scholarships and external loans. At both the primary and secondary&#13;
levels nearly three-fourths of the pupils in the high asset group had their&#13;

education financed mainly by their fathers, i.e. within the family. On the&#13;
other hand, among the low asset group only two-thirds in the primary school&#13;
level had their education financed mainly by their fathers. A sharper&#13;
contrast can be seen at the secondary level, where education is some five and&#13;
one-half times as expensive; only one-half of the poorer pupils had their&#13;
education financed within the family unit.&#13;
Educational financing also comes from within the extended family&#13;
system for a large proportion of the pupils. At the primary level about&#13;
two-fifths of the pupils have part of their educational expenses met by other&#13;
members of their families and also by their relatives; the proportion is&#13;
marginally higher among pupils from low-asset families. As expected, given&#13;
the higher cost of secondary schooling, the proportion of pupils at the&#13;
secondary level relying on more than one family or extended family member for&#13;
their educational expense is much larger. Among both groups of pupils over&#13;
one-half rely on more than one family member for their educational support.&#13;
Students in both asset groups also rely on external sources of&#13;
funding to cover their educational expenses. Although, in contrast to many&#13;
other African nations, Malawi allocates only a small portion of its&#13;
educational budget to scholarships, about 10 percent of the pupils, in both&#13;
the high and low asset groups, at the primary level receive some scholarship.&#13;
Among secondary school pupils only 7 percent from the high asset group receive&#13;
scholarships. In contrast over 15 percent from the low asset group were&#13;
awarded some scholarship.&#13;
The data in Table 8 also indicate that some students also had to rely&#13;
on external loans; and the proportion who did so increased with the increase&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
in user charges (fees). Among those who relied on external loans for various&#13;
reasons the proportions are, as expected, lower among primary school pupils&#13;
than secondary school pupils but the greater contrast lies between the high&#13;
asset group and the low asset group at both levels. Among the primary school&#13;
pupils only 8 percent from the high asset group relied on external loans&#13;
compared with almost 17 percent in the low asset group. This contrast is even&#13;
greater at the secondary level; less than 13 percent from the high asset group&#13;
relied on external loans compared with a startling 40 percent in the low asset&#13;
group. With the rise in school fees, and in boarding charges at the secondary&#13;
level, the proportions relying on loans at both primary and secondary levels&#13;
increased, though only marginally. This would seem to indicate that the&#13;
increases in user charges did not cause a significant increase in family&#13;
indebtedness to external sources. The data in Table 8 shows, however, that&#13;
high fees increased in importance as a reason for borrowing following the 1982&#13;
rise in fees. At the primary level, among the high asset group, the&#13;
proportion citing this reason for borrowing increased by 23 percentage points&#13;
to 63 percent; and for the low asset group, by 9 percentage points to 59&#13;
percent. For the secondary school pupils the proportion among the high asset&#13;
group rose by 15 percentage points to 75 percent, while among the low asset&#13;
group the proportion rose by 22 percentage points to 73 percent.&#13;
Whatever the private financing arrangements, however, the 1982&#13;
increase in fees did not appear to have had a very large effect on the&#13;
proportion of children in each family who stopped schooling. 1/ The dropout&#13;
1/ Students were specifically asked about siblings who dropped out because of&#13;
the recent fee increase. However, it is unlikely that they can&#13;
distinguish between situations where siblings dropped out for financial or&#13;
other reasons. Moreover, since nothing is known about the drop out rate&#13;
in the year before, it would be unwise to attribute the reported incidence&#13;
of dropping out entirely to the increase in user charges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
rate is defined here as the number of siblings who stopped schooling, at the&#13;
primary or secondary levels because of the rise in user charges, expressed as&#13;
a ratio of the total number schooling in the previous year. For the primary&#13;
school sample, this statistic is below 2 percent for both asset groups. In&#13;
the secondary sample, where students are likely to have more siblings of&#13;
secondary school age, the dropout rate is expectedly higher because of the&#13;
higher expenses involved. Nevertheless, the figure is still only 4 percent&#13;
for the high asset group, and 8 percent for the low asset group.&#13;
The impression which emerges is that households are generally willing&#13;
to pay at least the curent levels of user charges for the education of their&#13;
children. With the introduction of additional school fees or user charges&#13;
Malawian households tend to look for additional financing from the extended&#13;
family system or from external sources rather than terminate their children's&#13;
schooling.&#13;
b)   Private School Attendance&#13;
Another indication of the apparent willingness to pay is perhaps seen&#13;
in what families actually do when faced with a more expensive (private)&#13;
alternative to public education. Families who send their children to a more&#13;
expensive school must be both willing and able to bear the higher costs.&#13;
The sample includes students drawn from the only private secondary&#13;
school in Malawi. These students represent about 11 percent of the sample&#13;
students, which is comparable to the population share (12 percent) of private&#13;
students in secondary schools nationwide (see Appendix Table A.3).&#13;
Table 9 compares the sample characteristics of secondary students in&#13;
private and state or aided schools. The higher expenditure of private&#13;

the incidence of repetition is much lower during secondary schooling&#13;

itself, continuation is generally contingent upon good academic performance.&#13;
Nevertheless, some drop-outs from state/aided schools probably continue their&#13;
studies in the private sector, particularly if university education is their&#13;
(or their families') ultimate objective; hence the higher proportion of&#13;
privately-enrolled students having a history of repetition during secondary&#13;
schooling, and the higher proportion among them wishing to complete university&#13;
education. This also indicates the willingness of the private school to&#13;
enroll repeaters so long as they are willing to pay the higher charges.&#13;
The data confirm that students in the private school come largely&#13;
from more advantaged backgrounds; a higher proportion of their parents have&#13;
had at least primary education, the reported earnings of their fathers are&#13;
higher and more of them belong to families with high asset ownership. Not&#13;
surprisingly, fewer of them depend on relatives or external loans for&#13;
financial support. Another striking feature of the data is that the clientele&#13;
of the private school is drawn largely from students whose families live in&#13;
the same region as the school, that is, the Northern region; presumably the&#13;
higher fees are compensated for by the reduction in transport costs.&#13;
To standardise simultaneously for all the factors that might be&#13;
associated with private school attendance, we use multiple regression, in&#13;
which the dependent variable is defined as a 0-1 dummy variable corresponding&#13;
to whether or not the respondent attends private school. Due to the&#13;
dichotomous nature of the dependent variable, we use the logit model which has&#13;
the form given in equation (1) in section IV above. The regression results&#13;
appear in Table 10. The variables used are defined in Table A.4. Given the&#13;
small number of observations available, and the fact that some variables, such&#13;
as family wealth and parents' education, are highly correlated, it was neces-&#13;
sary to be selective in the choice of independent variables. Bearing in mind&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
The data in Table 11 reveal several interesting points.&#13;
Willingness to pay the high fees for private education is largely confined&#13;
to the richer group of students residing in the Northern region. In other&#13;
words, the combined cost of fees and transport is probably too high for&#13;
students from the Central or Southern regions, even for students from&#13;
richer backgrounds; this result is expected given the more abundant supply&#13;
of schools in these regions.&#13;
The higher probability of private school attendance among&#13;
repeaters has been noted earlier. Nevertheless, repeaters from poorer&#13;
backgrounds have a very much smaller chance of being able to continue&#13;
their studies at the private school. This implies that when continuation&#13;
is contingent upon the payment of the private school level of fees, many&#13;
of them would simply drop out of school altogether, even when higher fees&#13;
are mitigated by the smaller transportation costs, as in the case of&#13;
repeaters from poorer homes in the Northern region. Here we should emphasize&#13;
that these students are "poorer" only in comparison to their secondary school&#13;
peers, since students whose families appear to be able to pay even the&#13;
non-private level of fees must be considered relatively well-to-do in the&#13;
context of Malawi's income distribution. 1/&#13;
1/ According to one knowledgeable estimate, less than 10 percent of Malawian&#13;
households have an income exceeding K400 p.a. in 1979/80.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
VII.     Economic Rationale for the Willingness to Pay&#13;
Although education in Malawi involves considerable direct cash&#13;
outlay, households appear to be willing to pay, as the above discussion show.&#13;
This strong demand for education largely reflects economic considerations in&#13;
schooling decisions, although cultural factors may also be important,&#13;
particularly in the Northern region. 1/ The strong incentive to obtain&#13;
schooling can be seen, for example, in the fact that a large number of&#13;
Standard VIII pupils are willing to repeat the grade in order to obtain the&#13;
Primary School Leaving Certificate. Such a certificate in hand affects what&#13;
can be earned in the job market; for example, according to the government's&#13;
minimum wage rulings, a clerical employee in the tobacco handling industry who&#13;
has passed Standard VIII is entitled to a minimum wage of K 0.62 per day&#13;
compared to only K 0.43 per day for employees without this qualification&#13;
(World Bank, 1981, Table 20, pp. 33).&#13;
The economic incentives to obtain schooling are probably also&#13;
reflected in students' expectations. For secondary students the survey&#13;
questionnaire raised information on their expectations of the earnings&#13;
associated with two levels of secondary school qualifications, both at the&#13;
start of working life (Y ) and five years later (Y5).   The p.a. growth&#13;
rate (g) in expected earnings can thus be calculated according to:&#13;
(5)      g = [Ln(Y5/Y0)]/5&#13;
Table 12 displays the data on YO and g.   In general students' expectations&#13;
of the starting earnings at both the Junior Certificate and Malawi Certificate&#13;
1   Heyneman (1972, pp. 46) documents that primary schooling in the Northern&#13;
region "may have become internalized with the local society", being now&#13;
viewed almost like a traditional form of apprenticeship, and even as a&#13;
necessary part of initiation and passage into adult society.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
levels are comparable to what is actually being paid to new employees in the&#13;
public sector. However, their expectations of the rate of increase in&#13;
earnings appear to be overly optimistic; for example, students expect that&#13;
Junior Certificate holders' earnings would grow by 12.3 percent p.a. compared&#13;
to an actual rate of 7.2 percent p.a. in government employment. Even allowing&#13;
for the possibility that public sector wages do not represent conditions in&#13;
the private sector, these expectations are probably still too optimistic, 1/&#13;
particularly among females. One reason for students' high expectations may be&#13;
their lack of knowledge about labor market conditions; these expectations may&#13;
reflect more their wish for a high paying white-collar job, than a realistic&#13;
assessment of what they can actually earn when they eventually enter the labor&#13;
market.&#13;
The data in Table 12 permit calculations of the expected private&#13;
returns (before tax) to secondary schooling using the "elaborate method"&#13;
(Psacharopoulos, 1982). However, since the only pieces of information at our&#13;
disposal are direct costs, expected starting earnings and the expected growth&#13;
rate of earnings, several assumptions are required to accomplish the&#13;
calculations. In particular, in the base case we assume that the expected&#13;
staring earnings grow at the corresponding expected rates until age 30, after&#13;
which the earnings profile continues on a plateau until retirement at age 60.&#13;
In calculating the returns to lower secondary schooling, we also assumed that&#13;
the expected foregone earnings profile is the same as that associated with the&#13;
actual earnings of public sector employees with Standard VIII qualifications.&#13;
The direct cost is assumed to be K230 p.a. at all levels of secondary&#13;
schooling (see Table 2).&#13;
1/ Between 1977 and 1978, the average nominal earnings of employees in the&#13;
private sector grew at approximately 9.3% (Malawi Government, National&#13;
Statistical Office).&#13;

The results, under base case and alternative assumptions, appear in&#13;
Table 13. Given that students' expected earnings growth rates are much higher&#13;
than the actual growth rates, as noted above, it is tempting to draw the&#13;
conclusion that these results have overestimated the private returns to&#13;
schooling. However, since rate-of-return calculations use data on relative&#13;
earnings rather than absolute earnings, such a bias would be more likely only&#13;
when the relative rates of growth of expected earnings between different&#13;
education levels are over-optimistic compared to that of actual earnings for&#13;
the corresponding education levels. As it turns out, this bias is present to&#13;
a greater degree among females for both levels of secondary schooling, which&#13;
explains their higher expected rates of return for both levels of schooling,&#13;
compared to their male counterparts.&#13;
A comparison with estimates made elsewhere shows that the expected&#13;
rates of return presented here are in fact within reason, and may even be&#13;
under estimated. For example, a two year tracer study of 1976 secondary&#13;
school leavers indicates that the private rate of return varies between 31 and&#13;
50 percent, depending on the assumptions about the level of unemployment over&#13;
a working lifetime (Heyneman, 1980, pp. 22-34). 1/&#13;
The sensitivity analysis in Table 13 shows that if different growth&#13;
rates of earnings are assumed, expected returns decline quite substantially,&#13;
but nevertheless remain high. For example, if the expected earnings of lower&#13;
secondary school leavers (Y.) grow at the same rate as that of primary&#13;
school leavers (Yp), then the private returns drop from 19.1 percent to 13.0&#13;
percent for males; similarly if the expected earnings of upper secondary&#13;
1/ The estimation assumed a rather high alpha coefficient of 0.90. For a&#13;
succinct discussion on the alpha coefficient which is defined as that&#13;
portion of the earnings differential due entirely to schooling only see&#13;
Psacharopoulos (1973). See also the results derived by Tan (1983b) which&#13;
have been noted earlier in Section I.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
school leavers (Y m) grow at the rate of Y., the returns to upper secondary&#13;
schooling drop from 19.2 percent to 17.4 percent. As another example (not&#13;
shown in Table 13), if the actual data pertaining to public sector employees&#13;
(see Table 12, columns (3) and (4)) are substituted for the expected values&#13;
used in our calculations, the rate of return would be 12 percent for lower&#13;
secondary schooling; and 6 percent for upper secondary schooling. Of course,&#13;
these rates would be higher if we take into account the possibility that a&#13;
government employee can cross over to higher salary scales during his or her&#13;
career, in which case the average earnings growth rate would have been higher&#13;
than that assumed here.&#13;

In general, the rate of return evidence shows that education is&#13;
an extremely attractive personal investment, particularly for post-primary&#13;
students. It should be noted, however, that the perceived benefits may&#13;
differ according to family background, thus implying different degrees of&#13;
willingness to pay. It has been found elsewhere in the literature that&#13;
parents in higher socio-economic classes perceive greater gains to their&#13;
children's education than other parents (Psacharopoulos and Sanyal, 1981;&#13;
1982). Thus children from richer families not only benefit from their&#13;
parents' greater ability to pay, but also their greater willingness to pay.&#13;
VIII.      Conclusions and Implications&#13;
From the empirical analysis presented, two sets of conclusion may&#13;
be derived. The first is Malawi-specific while the second concerns broad&#13;
lessons for LDCs regarding the scope of user charge as a means of expanding&#13;
education in times of economic austerity.&#13;
a) Conclusions for Malawi&#13;
The empirical results show that Malawian households are&#13;
generally willing and able to pay for schooling. Analysis based on the&#13;
survey data indicate that the household enrollment ratio is rather&#13;
inelastic with respect to the total household financial burden of&#13;
education. Households have been willing to borrow from extended family&#13;
members or even from external sources to pay for the education of their&#13;
children. Although school fees were raised by about 50 percent in 1982,&#13;
actual drop out rates due to the increase were very low. Moreover, given a&#13;
choice between no schooling and schooling in an expensive private&#13;
alternative some (relatively richer) households were willing and able to&#13;
opt for the latter. The economic rationale for this willingness to pay&#13;
lies in the high private returns to education, particularly for&#13;
post-primary education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
These findings suggest that additional private resources&#13;
could possibly be tapped to supplement government funds for the sector.&#13;
The increase in resources could be used to facilitate its physical expansion&#13;
and/or quality enhancement. Suppose, for simplicity, that the government&#13;
shifts part of the burden of financing education to private households by&#13;
charging fees that are sufficiently high enough to cover non-teacher recurrent&#13;
costs. The rationale for following this rule is that capital expenditures&#13;
benefit the nation as a whole over a long time span, whereas other&#13;
expenditures, such as for pedagogical materials benefit particular cohorts of&#13;
students. To a large extent, the division of financial responsibility between&#13;
capital and recurrent cost already occurs at the primary level; indeed in many&#13;
instances, the cost of construction and classroom furniture is also met by&#13;
private households. By contrast, in the secondary school sector the&#13;
non-teacher recurrent costs are only partly met by user charges; for&#13;
university education no part of these costs is at present recouped, since fees&#13;
are not charged.&#13;
According to the broad guideline set out above, user charges for&#13;
primary education should remain roughly at its current level in real terms,&#13;
that is, rising over time only as fast as the rate of inflation. For equity&#13;
reasons, however, there may be a case for increases at a faster rate for urban&#13;
primary schools, since in 1982, the fee increase for these students was only&#13;
43 percent in grades 1-5, and merely 15 percent in grades 6-8, compared to 50&#13;
percent for all other grades in rural schools (see appendix A). If the 50&#13;
percent increase had also been applied to urban schools, the fees should have&#13;
been 5.25 Kwachas instead of 5.00 Kwachas in lower grades, and 9.75 Kwachas&#13;
instead of 7.5 Kwachas in the higher grades. In fact, since urban families&#13;
are usually wealthier, the fee increase could even have been slightly higher.&#13;
If, say, fees of 5.5 Kwachas and 10 Kwachas (real terms) respectively are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
collected, a conservative estimate indicates that 0.2 million Kwachas would be&#13;
added to existing government revenues. 1/&#13;
Another group of primary school students for whom higher fees could&#13;
be considered are repeaters in grade 8. At present, many students repeat this&#13;
grade serveral times in the hope of passing the requisite exams to qualify for&#13;
one of the extremely limited number of secondary school places. Their&#13;
presence in the system stretches classroom resources, and is responsible for&#13;
the fact that student-teacher ratios in Malawi far exceed the average even for&#13;
African countries. Since these students aim to enter secondary school, they&#13;
are presumably willing and able to pay at least the level of fees charged in&#13;
secondary schools; they thus represent an additional source of revenue for the&#13;
sector. Suppose that repeaters are charged twice the rate for non-repeaters,&#13;
that is 12 Kwachas in rural schools and 20 Kwachas in urban schools, it is&#13;
estimated that as much as 0.4 million Kwachas could 'L- added to existing&#13;
government revenues. 2/ Further improvement could be achieved by encouraging&#13;
more repeaters to enroll with the Malawi Corrospondence College, where they&#13;
would pay a somewhat higher fee, for example, by instituting a maximum age&#13;
limit for primary school attendance or by limiting the number of times a&#13;
student may take the eighth grade examination.&#13;
For secondary education, application of the general guideline of&#13;
recovering non-capital costs suggests that fees should increase moderately in&#13;
real terms. For example, if the non-teacher recurrent costs are con-&#13;
1/ The calculation assumes that 70000 students attend grades 1-5 in urban&#13;
primary schools, and 25,000 attend grades 6-8. These data correspond to&#13;
enrollment in 1980/81 (Malawi government, 1981). The total primary school&#13;
enrollment (assisted schools) was 755,000.&#13;
2/ Based on 1980/1981 statistics (Malawi Government, 1981). There were 5,000&#13;
grade 8 repeaters in urban schools and 42,000 in rural schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
servatively defined to include only materials, food stuffs, equipment, fuel&#13;
and other consummables, it is estimated that the 1982-83 level of user charges&#13;
recouped only 82 percent of these costs (see Malawi Government, 1983, pp 81&#13;
and 83). The estimated shortfall of 65,000 Kwachas could thus have been&#13;
covered by a real increase of only 4 Kwachas per student, given the 1982-83&#13;
student population of 17,000. However, if all non-teacher recurrent costs 1/&#13;
are included, the required real increase would have to be over 25 Kwachas per&#13;
student. For illustrative purposes, suppose that fees increase by 10&#13;
Kwachas. Since the social demand for secondary education is extremely strong,&#13;
few students would probably discontinue school following this increase.&#13;
Moreover, since it implies less than a 5 percent increase in the unit private&#13;
burden of education, the empirical analysis in earlier sections also indicate&#13;
that the resulting decline in enrollment would be small. For the government,&#13;
this fee increase would generate an additional 0.2 million Kwachas. 2/&#13;
Thus, in total, as much as 0.8 million Kwachas could be generated via&#13;
user charges if the suggested price increases for secondary and primary&#13;
schools are implemented. This sum represents 18 percent of the 1982-83&#13;
government budget for primary education or 11 percent of the budget for&#13;
secondary education (see appendix Table A. 2). The increase would cover the&#13;
operating cost of an additional 38,000 primary school places or 3500 secondary&#13;
school places. 3/ Since the social rate of return is higher for secondary&#13;
1/ Excludes grants and subscriptions which are channeled to mission schools.&#13;
2/ Assuming there are 17,000 secondary school students (see Appendix Table&#13;
A.2).&#13;
3/ Assuming that school quality remain at existing levels. Alternative uses&#13;
for the additional resources could include both quality improvements and&#13;
quantity increases, the precise allocation depending on an evaluation of&#13;
returns to quality or quantity investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
education, expansion should, however, be concentrated at the latter level.&#13;
As for university education, if the same principle of recouping&#13;
non-teacher recurrent costs is also adhered to, then a radical departure from&#13;
existing policies would be called for, namely introducing fees where none&#13;
existed before. The precise level of these fees remains to be estimated from&#13;
more detailed data than are available in the source (Malawi Government, 1983)&#13;
cited above. Nevertheless, even before taking the big step of introducing&#13;
fees, some movement toward cost recovery can be made by discontinuing the&#13;
existing policy of providing all students with stipends, free food and&#13;
accommodation. Since these costs could easily amount to 400 Kwachas per&#13;
student, abolition of such subsidies would enhance government revenues by 0.7&#13;
million Kwachas, which would finance the running cost of over 2500 secondary&#13;
places. 1/ The suggested reduction in subsidies would probably not affect&#13;
university enrollment in that many students would still continue their&#13;
studies, since the private returns to this level of education would remain&#13;
enormous (see Tan 1983b). The government could, however, go further by&#13;
introducing user charges, since such a move would not only target cost&#13;
recovery policies in the area of greatest potential, but also achieve greater&#13;
equity.&#13;
Although a full treatment of the equity implications of user charges&#13;
is beyond the scope of this paper, there are, however, a few additional&#13;
cautionary remarks that have their place here. As seen in the empirical&#13;
1/ According to the Bath Report prepared for the Government of Malawi, the&#13;
unit cost of providing student living and stipends was 400 Kwachas in&#13;
1981. The number of university level students is assumed to be 1723&#13;
(Malawi Government, 1981).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
evidence in earlier parts of this study, schooling expenditure lies beyond the&#13;
immediate influence of the household. The existing level of user charges, let&#13;
alone further increases, implies a heavier burden upon poorer households than&#13;
on richer families, a disadvantage which is exacerbated by the fact that most&#13;
poor families are larger. In the face of higher charges, poorer households&#13;
may respond by putting fewer of the eligible children in school, or even by&#13;
removing some from school. They may also accommodate the higher user charges&#13;
by relying more heavily on extended family members and external loans. They&#13;
are, however, placed at a distinct disadvantage when it boils down to a choice&#13;
between no schooling and schooling in an expensive private alternative; while&#13;
the richer household can afford the latter alternative, the poorer household&#13;
cannot. In this setting, any new policy that raises the private burden of&#13;
education should be accompanied by measures to minimize inequity, for example,&#13;
via scholarships targetted for indigent students from rural households; at the&#13;
university level, student loans (see Woodhall, 1983) could be made available&#13;
to widen access.&#13;
These measures would probably enhance the political viability of the&#13;
suggested change in pricing policies in the sector. Unfortunately a full&#13;
assessment of the political repercussions of these changes cannot be attempted&#13;
using the data on which this study is based. In particular, our assessment of&#13;
the willingness of households to pay is based on what we know from their past&#13;
behavior. Since many already borrow to finance their children's education,&#13;
they may be approaching a threshold in tolerating the existing burden.&#13;
Students' responses to contingency questions indicate, moreover, that the&#13;
larger the hypothetical fee increase, the lower the proportion who will remain&#13;
in school. Even discounting the usefulness of their answers, and recalling&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
that the private returns to education would remain high, particularly for&#13;
post-primary schooling, these contingency responses nevertheless strike a note&#13;
of caution.&#13;
While efforts are being directed towards tapping additional private&#13;
resources, it is perhaps equally important to maximise the efficient use of&#13;
resources already available. One obvious way in which an improvement can be&#13;
achieved is by correcting imbalances in the pattern of private schooling&#13;
expenditure. For example, public secondary school students, when compared to&#13;
their private school counterparts, appear to be spending a disproportionately&#13;
larger amount on school attire than on more directly pedagogical materials.&#13;
Since public funds cannot make up for the shortfall in expenditure on learning&#13;
materials, it is probably necessary to encourage students to alter their&#13;
expenditure patterns. Undoubtedly, for those more familiar with local&#13;
cornditions in Malawi, there may be other similar ways to improve efficiency,&#13;
but the example cited here suffices for illustrative purposes.&#13;
Finally, to strengthen the role and effectiveness of user charges,&#13;
the management of school fees should increasingly be decentralized. Thus, as&#13;
for primary education, local and possibly even school authorities in the&#13;
secondary education sector, should be given greater autonomy in the collection&#13;
and allocation of school fee funds. Naturally, as past experience has shown,&#13;
such decentralization requires the introduction of checks to prevent abuses&#13;
and financial irregularities. One great advantage of a change in the&#13;
suggested direction is that, in strengthening parents' perceptions that their&#13;
children are the immediate beneficiaries of user charges, it will reinforce,&#13;
and even increase, the private willingness to pay for publicly provided&#13;
education services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
b) Lessons for LDCs&#13;
One of the objectives of charging fees for public education&#13;
is to relax constraints in the public budget, so that an expansion in the&#13;
provision of education may be accomplished without loss in educational&#13;
quality. This paper's analysis, based on data from Malawi, permits us to&#13;
draw two general conclusions relevant to LDCs regarding user charges as a&#13;
policy instrument.&#13;
On the demand side, the extent to which fees can be raised is&#13;
larger, the lower the responsiveness of potential enrollment to fee&#13;
increases, and the greater the initial excess demand. In Malawi this&#13;
responsiveness was found to be relatively low. Such a characteristic is&#13;
probably common to most other LDCs since the private returns to education&#13;
are high compared to returns to alternative personal or household&#13;
investments. By contrast, the excess demand for education is likely to&#13;
differ among   countries as it is partly determined by the initial supply&#13;
of places. These demand-side considerations indicate that the amount of&#13;
private household resources that could be mobilized via user charges would&#13;
probably vary from country to country.&#13;
On the supply side, the existing level of unit cost is a key&#13;
factor influencing the possible expansion of education with the resources&#13;
made available through user charges. For example, the unit cost of&#13;
secondary education in Malawi is relatively high. This feature implies&#13;
that a substantial increase in fees would be necessary in order to achieve&#13;
an expansion in the provision of places. If the unit cost had been lower,&#13;
for example, at the average for Anglophone African countries, a greater&#13;
expansion could have been realized with a smaller fee increase, Figure 2&#13;
illustrates this conclusion.&#13;

In this paper we have shown that user charges could be&#13;
effective in relaxing constraints in the government budget to permit&#13;
expansion in the provision of public education. Although it is only one&#13;
among a variety of policy options, user charges may be an important policy&#13;
instrument to consider when the conditions in specific country contexts are&#13;
appropriate.&#13;

APPENDIX A&#13;
METHODOLOGICAL NOTE&#13;
In estimating the effect of educational cost on household enrollment&#13;
(Section V in the report), some econometric problems arise over the way in&#13;
which the dependent variable should be specified for regression purposes.&#13;
This note evaluates two alternative specifications; in one, the dependent&#13;
variable is defined as P, the proportion enrolled among children of eligible&#13;
ages in a household, and in the second, it is defined as the log-oddi of P,&#13;
that is, Ln [P/(l-P)]. For both specifications, OLS is used to estimate the&#13;
regression equation. We show below that despite problems with using the first&#13;
specification, the resulting estimates are more reliable than those obtained&#13;
from the second specification, and are therefore to be preferred.&#13;
Theoretical and Data Considerations&#13;
Since P is defined as a proportion, its value is necessarily&#13;
constrained to fall in the range 0-1. In the first specification where the&#13;
equation estimated is P - a - b X 1/, the predicted values of P may, however,&#13;
fall outside the 0-1 range, as indicated in the diagram below. This problem&#13;
p&#13;
p - a - bX&#13;
0&#13;
x             x                     X&#13;
1/ For the econometric experiments below, X is represented, for simplicity,&#13;
by Ln (Total Fees) and a dummy variable indicating urban-rural residence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
is resolved by stating the required relationship as&#13;
1           for 0 &lt; X -xl&#13;
(1A)                P    =      a - bX       for xl, X s x2&#13;
0           for x2&lt; X&#13;
There still remains, however, the problem of heteroscedasticity since&#13;
the residual variance is likely to be larger for observations where X is&#13;
outside the x1 - x2 range. The existence of this problem violates the&#13;
constant variance assumption required to obtain estimates with BLUE (Best&#13;
Linear Unbiased Estimator) properties. In particular, the estimated standard&#13;
error of the regression coefficient may be biased, although the coefficients&#13;
themselves remain unbiased (Chiswick &amp; Chiswick, 1975). Bias in the standard&#13;
error influences the outcomes of tests for statistical significance; for&#13;
example, if an upward bias exists, the standard error may indicate that the&#13;
corresponding coefficient is statistically insignificant, when in fact the&#13;
opposite conclusion may have been drawn from an unbiased standard error. It&#13;
is likely, however, that for coefficients with very small estimated standard&#13;
errors (or large t-ratios), their statistical significance would remain&#13;
essentially unaffected even if the test had been performed using unbiased&#13;
standard errors. As it happens, the estimated standard error for the&#13;
coefficient of the variable of most interest to this paper, Ln (Total Fees),&#13;
turns out to be extremely small. Thus, the conclusion that it exerts a&#13;
statistically significant influence on household enrollment would probably&#13;
still be true in the absence of heteroscedasticity. As indicated in the text,&#13;
this conclusion is supported by the results obtained after correction for&#13;
heteroscedasticity using a two step weighted least squares method.&#13;
An alternative way of specifying the regression relationship is given&#13;
by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
(2A)     Ln [P/(1-P)] = a - bX                for (O&lt;P&lt;l)&#13;
or equivalently,&#13;
P = 1/[l + e-(a-bX) ]&#13;
The diagrams below illustrate the estimated equation.&#13;
Ln [(l-p)]&#13;
Ln[p/(1-p)I=a-bX        1&#13;
Pe x (a-bX)&#13;
0&#13;
x                                         x&#13;
The advantage of this formulation is that the predicted P's all fall within&#13;
the 0-1 range; moreover, the problem of heteroscadasticity is now probably&#13;
largely absent.&#13;
The theoretical advantages are, however, outweighed by practical&#13;
problems in implementing the regressions. These problems arise because the&#13;
data set contains some observations for which P is either greater or equal to&#13;
one, 1/ obviously reflecting measurement errors. It is, however, reasonable&#13;
to interpret these values of P as indicating situations where all eligible&#13;
children are enrolled. Nevertheless, in transforming P to Ln [P/(l-P)], a&#13;
value of P = 1 cannot be entered. An obvious solution is to assign P a value&#13;
close to one. There is no theoretical reason to prefer one value of P, close&#13;
to one, to another value of P, also close to one. However, the precise value&#13;
of P, chosen arbitrarily, is likely to exert a powerful effect on the&#13;
regression results. To illustrate, consider the following transformation of P&#13;
to Ln[P/(l-P)] based on alternative values of P close to one:&#13;
1/ Since the data is constructed from samples of primary and secondary school&#13;
children, there is no observation in the data sets for which P is zero or&#13;
less.&#13;

figure below:&#13;
I Assign P=0.999999&#13;

x&#13;
Most of the observations for which P is equal to or greater than one occur in&#13;
households where Xt, the educational burden, is small. Thus, the smaller&#13;
the value assigned to P for these observations, the larger the value of&#13;
Ln [P/(1-P)], and, the steeper the resulting estimated slope of equation&#13;
(2A). Since the difference in the results arises from what is essentially an&#13;
arbitrary choice with no theoretical basis, there is no clear reason to prefer&#13;
one set of estimates to another. It is tempting to avoid this problem by&#13;
restricting observations to those with value of P in the (0&lt; P&lt; 1) range.&#13;
This restriction will, however, bias the value of b downwards, since there is&#13;
a selectivity bias in the exclusion rule.&#13;
The actual importance of the problem outlined above is an empirical&#13;
matter, depending partly on the proportion of observations outside the&#13;
(0&lt; P &lt;1) range. About 12 percent of the observations in the primary sample&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
belong to this category; in the secondary sample, the corresponding figure is&#13;
18 percent. For both samples, these observations are numerous enough to&#13;
introduce significant errors, as the experiments in Table A.7 show. For&#13;
example, under alternative assumptions about the value of P when it is outside&#13;
the (0&lt; P&lt; 1) range, the estimated value of b ranges from -1.10 to -3.60 for&#13;
the primary sample, when it includes all observations; and from -0.95 to -2.91&#13;
when only observations in the (0&lt; P&lt; 1) range are included.    The resulting&#13;
elasticity estimates range from -0.43 to -1.32, and from -0.46 to -1.49&#13;
respectively.&#13;
To summarize, there are theoretical reasons to prefer specification&#13;
(2A) to (1A). However, because of data characteristics, the actual&#13;
implementation of the regression according to (2A) requires assumptions that&#13;
lead to large errors in the resulting estimates. In the light of these&#13;
errors, the specification of (iA) is preferable. The case for relying on its&#13;
results is further strengthened by the fact that the OLS estimation produces&#13;
bias only in the standard error of the estimated coefficient, but not in the&#13;
coefficient itself. As discussed above, this error is likely to be relatively&#13;
unimportant for the present purposes, given the extremely large t-ratio values&#13;
associated with the coefficient of the central variable (Ln (Total Fees)) in&#13;
our analysis. Moreover, after correction for heteroscedasticity using&#13;
Aitken's generalized least squares method, the results remain largely the same.&#13;

            User charges for education : the ability
            and willingness to pay in Malawi
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Investment in education is generally
            recognized as essential for a country's long term
            economic and social development. However, present
            macroeconomic conditions have limited allocation of public
            resources for education. Policymakers are seeking
            alternative sources of finance, one of which is the tapping
            of private household resources via user charges. This paper
            addresses two main issues involved in mobilizing resources
            by this method: (i) the ability and willingness of families
            to pay; and (ii) the possible expansion of enrollment that
            might be accomplished, given public budget constraints. The
            data on Malawi suggest the following: (i) a moderate fee
            increase is unlikely to precipitate a large dropout rate
            among students; (ii) excess demand will more than compensate
            for those students who do drop out due to the fee increase;
            and (iii) since fee increases will have a stronger impact on
            lower income families, they should be linked with equity
            measures such as scholarships.
