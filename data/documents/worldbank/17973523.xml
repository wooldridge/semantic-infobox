Interviewer's name:    Robert W. Oliver&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    This is July 12, 1986.     I am about to have a conversation with Dr.&#13;
Andrew Kamarck about his experiences in the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Andy, I wonder if we could begin this time by my asking you to say&#13;
something about your own career before you came to the Bank, including a&#13;
bit about people that you remember from the days you worked in the United&#13;
States Treasury Department, and perhaps a little about your experiences in&#13;
the Marshall Plan.    However, to begin with, maybe you'd tell about coming&#13;
to the Federal Reserve System.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:    In June 1939 I accepted a job with the Federal Reserve System.       I&#13;
had originally had an offer from the Anti-Trust      Division of the Department&#13;
of Justice, and that basically was where I really should have gone, because&#13;
my concentration in economics had been in corporations and industry.        I had&#13;
been offered a job there, and I accepted it.      But when I got to Washington&#13;
I discovered that the budget--the Department of Justice's budget--had not&#13;
yet been passed in the Congress, and they didn't quite know what it would&#13;
be.    So I didn't have a job until the appropriation came in.     In the&#13;
meanwhile I looked around to see what else was possible.      Alan Sweezey, who&#13;
was working for the Federal Reserve, suggested that I might interview&#13;
the International Section of Federal Reserve, and I did.      He also suggested&#13;
I might interview the Treasury Department Division of Monetary Research,&#13;
which I did.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      The International Section of the Federal Reserve offered me a job, the&#13;
Treasury offered me a job, and the Department of Justice offered me a job.&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                -2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK)&#13;
The Department of Justice job was $2,000 a year, the Treasury job was&#13;
$2,400 a year, and the Federal Reserve job was $2,500 a year.          Since the&#13;
Justice Department job was still dependent upon the budget going through&#13;
the Congress--and God knew when that was going to happen--and I didn't have&#13;
any money, I wanted a job right away.        The Federal Reserve was offering me&#13;
more, and a $100 in those days was equivalent to about a thousand today--at&#13;
least a thousand today.     In addition, when I had been interviewed by the&#13;
Federal Reserve people, they were rather nice and polite.        The Treasury&#13;
people interviewed me very roughly.     I think they were trying to see what&#13;
would happen in a confrontational type of interview.        So I thought the&#13;
Federal Reserve are nicer people and are going to pay me more, so I&#13;
accepted the Federal Reserve job.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So I went to work for the Federal Reserve in the summer of 1939 in the&#13;
International Section.     I had been there about three months--not quite&#13;
three months in September--when World War II broke out in Europe with the&#13;
invasion of Poland by the Germans.     Shortly thereafter I was asked by&#13;
Tayler Ostrander in the Treasury Department if I would come over.          Somebody&#13;
wanted to talk to me.     I went over and talked with Captain W.D. Puleston.&#13;
He had been brought in by the Secretary of the Treasury as an adviser from&#13;
the Navy Department.     The Secretary had brought in at the same time Jacob&#13;
Viner and Winfield Reiffler, so he had three special advisers to advise him&#13;
on development in the war.    Viner and Reiffler left after several months.&#13;
The fighting in Poland only lasted about 17 or 18 days.        This was followed&#13;
by what was called the Phony War in Europe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Basically what was happening was a type of economic warfare, and&#13;
Puleston decided that he needed an economist to help him follow&#13;
developments in the war for the Secretary.       He was looking for an economist&#13;
who could read German and who had some military background.        I had a&#13;
Reserve commission.     I could read German.     I was an economist.   So they&#13;
offered me a job.     I said I couldn't, I was working for thâ&#128;¢ Pederal&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                   -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCKJ&#13;
Reserve.     So then they spoke to Dr. Goldenweiser and asked to borrow me.&#13;
Dr. Goldenweiser was head of the Division of Research and Statistics.           Dr.&#13;
Goldenweiser wrote to them and said under no circumstances was he going to&#13;
lend me to the Treasury.     It was a nice letter which Captain Puleston later&#13;
showed me.     Dr. Goldenweiser said, "We have a hard time finding people of&#13;
this caliber and we're not about to release him to the Treasury."        That&#13;
convinced Captain Puleston that he definitely wanted me.        So he went to the&#13;
Secretary, and the Secretary wrote to the Chairman of the Board, Marriner&#13;
Eccles, saying that for purposes of national security or the national&#13;
interests or something like that, it was very important that I be lent to&#13;
the Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     When you say Secretary, you mean Secretary Morgenthau?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Secretary Morgenthau, yes.     So I got borrowed by the Treasury&#13;
initially for a six-month period.     I worked with Captain Puleston.     Captain&#13;
Puleston had been Chief of Naval Intelligence, so he had good contacts with&#13;
the Navy and with the Army.     The Secretary also got briefing memoranda from&#13;
the British.     It may have been the same type of memoranda that the British&#13;
military furnished their Cabinet as to what was going on.        So the job of&#13;
Captain Puleston, helped by me, was to interpret these memoranda for the&#13;
Secretary, what this meant in terms of the war and so on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    When the six months were over there was the question of my going back&#13;
to the Federal Reserve.     Puleston by this time definitely wanted me, so he&#13;
gave me a substantial promotion and increase in pay of $700--the equivalent&#13;
of $7,000 today--to persuade me to stay.        And I thought this was very, very&#13;
good, so I resigned from the Federal Reserve and went on the Treasury&#13;
payroll.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In the fall of 1940 Puleston decided to leave Treasury.        I think his&#13;
initial appointment had run out, and I think to some extent the Secretary&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                               -4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK]&#13;
had become a little disillusioned with him partly because Puleston began to&#13;
regard it as his duty to try to keep the Secretary's morale up about what&#13;
was happening in Europe and tended to give the Secretary optimistic&#13;
reports.    Then the optimistic reports would be falsified by the events.        At&#13;
any rate, there was a mutual parting at that time, friendly on both sides.&#13;
So Puleston left, and there was the question of what was to be done with&#13;
me.    I was placed administratively under the Division of Monetary Research&#13;
but continued my job for the Secretary.     I started doing all the things&#13;
that Puleston had been doing, including trotting over to the Army and the&#13;
Navy periodically to see what they had to say.     This continued for a few&#13;
months, and then the information that we were getting from the British was&#13;
getting to be pretty secret.     For example, when the German battleship&#13;
Bismarck broke out into the Atlantic in May 1941, the British learned&#13;
fairly quickly that it had done so, but this information wasn't made&#13;
public.     It was in the secret memorandum on the progress of the war.     It&#13;
was important to explain to the Secretary what the Bismarck was and what&#13;
impact this would have on Atlantic shipping and on British supplies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      At any rate, the Secretary suddenly started worrying about whether or&#13;
not this information was being kept sufficiently confidential.      Since I was&#13;
in Monetary Research it received a carbon copy of everything I wrote for&#13;
the Secretary.     I think this had actually been agreed at the time between&#13;
the Secretary and Harry White, when I had been put in White's Division of&#13;
Monetary Reasearch.     The Secretary at that point decided that he wanted me&#13;
directly in his own office.     So I was transferred out of Harry White's&#13;
division into the Secretary's office, and there I stayed until I was&#13;
finally called up by the Army.     I was called up in July 1942.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Before we go into your Army career, let me ask about some of the&#13;
people that you may have met.     Even though you didn't actually work in the&#13;
Division of Monetary Research, you might conceivably have met Harry White&#13;
and some of his people.     Would you say a word about them?   Were you aware&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[OLIVER]&#13;
of the fact .that some of them even as early as then were thinking about&#13;
some sort of a post-war monetary organization such as the International&#13;
Monetary Fund?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Yes, I became acquainted with practically all of them.       I knew&#13;
them to lesser or greater degree, because my office was in the same section&#13;
of the Treasury as theirs.     In fact, for a period of time, Eddie [Edward&#13;
M.] Bernstein and I shared an office.        This was a bit amusing because at&#13;
that time in terms of professional rank, he ranked considerably above me,&#13;
but because my work was supposed to be confidential I had a secretary and&#13;
he didn't.     He had to share a secretary with other people.     Occasionally I&#13;
let him use my secretary.     So I knew Eddie Bernstein quite well from the&#13;
time that we shared an office together.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And I knew the others.     Also, even when I was working for Captain&#13;
Puleston, when I thought I came across something which I thought was&#13;
particularly interesting from the economic or financial point of view for&#13;
the United States, I would write a memorandum to Harry White about it.             One&#13;
anecdote on that.     It was a real lesson to me.    We were getting some&#13;
reports on what the British were doing in terms of their Ministry of&#13;
Economic Warfare, and as I began looking at these things, it occurred to me&#13;
that they were not only waging economic war against the Germans, but that&#13;
the kind of measures that they were taking were hurting American commerce&#13;
also, because they were tying up the transactions in various ways.          So I&#13;
wrote a little memorandum on that, and I sent it to Harry White.          I didn't&#13;
hear anything, so after about a week, I made an appointment with his&#13;
secretary and went in to see him.     And he said, "What do you want to talk&#13;
to me about?"     I said, "About this memorandum I sent you."    And he said,&#13;
"What about it?"    And I said, "Well, don't you think it's interesting?"          He&#13;
says, "Yes, it's very interesting, but so what?"       In other words, I was&#13;
approaching it basically as a graduate student.       I mean this is an&#13;
interesting bit of information.      He was asking from the policy point of&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                 -6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK]&#13;
view of the U.S. Treasury.       "Okay, so this is information.   What are we&#13;
supposed to do about it?     What do you want us to do about it?"     I had not&#13;
thought about that at all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Actually this was a very important lesson for me, because from that&#13;
point on whenever, both in the Treasury and in the Bank in the work I've&#13;
done, I've always thought, "Okay, this is interesting.       It interests me,&#13;
but before I try to communicate it, so what?       So what do you do about it?&#13;
What's the implication? . What kind of policy decisions?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    During this time I was also drawn into working with the division on&#13;
economic and financial matters affected by the war.      When the British came&#13;
to the U.S. for help in replacing their shipping losses from submarine&#13;
warfare, I was involved in providing the analysis of whether the program&#13;
prepared was really needed, too large, or not large enough.        I was deeply&#13;
involved in the problems of financing British civilian and war supplies in&#13;
the U.S., which ultimately led to the Treasury's persuading President&#13;
Roosevelt to introduce Lend-Lease and other such programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Before you leave that subject altogether, is it proper for me to&#13;
infer that Harry White could be a bit abrupt and short?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Oh, my word, yes.   He was also, in some respects, quite&#13;
arbitrary.     Sometimes he was very funny.   There were stories about him in&#13;
the Division of Monetary Research about the ways in which the Division of&#13;
Monetary Research operated.      Some policy issue would come up, and they&#13;
would decide that to get the Secretary to take action a memorandum to the&#13;
Secretary should be sent as fast as possible, and very often wheri&#13;
presidential action was required a memorandum would be drafted for the&#13;
Secretary's signature for him to sent to the White House.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    There was a great deal of competition among the different departments,&#13;
and the Treasury was very imperialistic.      Morgenthau, at one point, went on&#13;
a trip and visited Navy ships, warships and so on.      And somebody asked him,&#13;
"What the hell has this got to do with the the U.S. Treasury?"       He said,&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                 -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(KAMARCK)&#13;
"Well, it's the U.S. Treasury that's paying for this."        The point was that&#13;
everything has a monetary side, so the Treasury took the viewpoint that,&#13;
since everything had a monetary side, the Treasury's business was&#13;
everything.     There were several people in the Treasury who were either of&#13;
British origin or had studied in Oxford or Cambridge, and in the British&#13;
system the Treasury is into everything.        The Treasury is the top department&#13;
and the Treasury people furnish policy guidance throughout the whole&#13;
Government.     The U.S. Treasury had a little bit of ambition of that kind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So when the policy issues would come the Treasury thought that the&#13;
Secretary or the President ought to do something about them, and then it&#13;
was a question of getting the memorandum out as fast as possible.        The way&#13;
it was done very often would be Harry White sitting there with maybe one or&#13;
another of his senior people like Frank Coe or Eddie Bernstein, and White&#13;
would call in two or three of his staff.        They'd sit around and have two or&#13;
three secretaries there to take dictation.        Harry White would start off by&#13;
saying, "The following is the situation.       We believe the following should&#13;
be done," or, "We believe this policy action should be taken for the&#13;
following three reasons."       Once he was dictating, "One, two, three."&#13;
Somebody said, "Why three reasons?"      And he said, "Well, there are always&#13;
three reasons.     There are always three reasons for everything."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Another time he was dictating and somebody threw in, "This should be&#13;
done for the following three reasons."        He'd give one reason, and anybody&#13;
sitting around would then.chime in with another reason.       And somebody else&#13;
would chime in with a third reason.      And I think Oscar Gass--Oscar Gass was&#13;
a very irreverent person who had done his economics at Oxford--listened and&#13;
said, "But, Mr. White, that reason argues in exactly the opposite&#13;
direction."     Harry White didn't blink an eye.    He said to his secretary,&#13;
"Change that.     We believe this in spite of the following considerations."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     That's marvelous.&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                               -8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:   So that was Harry White.    He was very abrupt.   No doubt about it.&#13;
He could be very, very rough.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Who were the other people around there?      Well, there was Frank Coe who&#13;
had been a Canadian.     I think maybe he was still a Canadian at that time.&#13;
I'm not sure when he became an American citizen.     He was a much smoother&#13;
person than White.     A great believer in interdepartmental organization.     He&#13;
brought into the U.S. Government, as far as I'm aware--at least I think it&#13;
started there--the whole concept of task forces.     They were called working&#13;
parties, where you had a subject, a problem and you'd bring in as many&#13;
people who had some knowledge of it from all the departments concerned to&#13;
prepare a technical paper.     The working party was not supposed to come up&#13;
with policy recommendations.     It was supposed to bring out what the problem&#13;
was, the different bits of information that pertained to the problem, and&#13;
based on that a policy paper would be prepared by the senior staff which&#13;
then eventually would go to the Cabinet level.     He brought that into the&#13;
U.S. Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Then there was Harold Glasser, who was from the University of Chicago.&#13;
There were quite a few University of Chicago people around.      Harold Glasser&#13;
was a very hard worker.     Unlike White--White loved confrontation; White&#13;
loved conflict--Glasser believed in cooperation so that when later on he&#13;
became the Director of the Division of Monetary Research for a while, the&#13;
whole departmental atmosphere changed.      Instead of being at swords&#13;
point--the State Department was usually the principal antagonist for the&#13;
Treasury, sometimes the Federal Reserve, sometimes other departments--when&#13;
Glasser was in there an attempt was made to work together, to work out&#13;
solutiÂ·ons in common, not to get the Cabinet members in a conflict but to&#13;
try on a technical level to work out a solution and then present it to the&#13;
Cabinet level.&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                               -9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK)&#13;
    The senior staff was just a small group of people, but they were all&#13;
very bright, all very hard working.     Most of the rest of the Government at&#13;
that time tended to work 9:00 to 5:00 or 9:00 to 4:30, whatever it was, and&#13;
that was it.     The Treasury had the morale, the esprit--you've got a&#13;
problem; well, you just work through the night, if necessary, to solve it.&#13;
Very tough on people.     But the people who had been recruited in the&#13;
Treasury loved it.     In fact, most of them were really anti-social, really&#13;
had very little social life outside of their work, if any.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I mentioned Oscar Gass, who had been trained at Oxford.        He was a very&#13;
brilliant guy.     He reminded me of Rex Stout's detective, Nero Wolfe.&#13;
Aanyho, Oscar Gass did not like to go into any kind of physical activity,&#13;
but had a very, a very brilliant mind, a quick wit.        He was able to come up&#13;
with words.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Then there was Sol Adler.     Sol Adler was British.     He had gone to&#13;
Cambridge.     He was also a very, very good economist, but very absent-&#13;
minded, very sloppy.     He was a bit toed out, and when he dictated, he put&#13;
his hands behind his back and sort of waddled up and down the room toeing&#13;
out a bit like a duck.     He had a drooping mustache.     He would concentrate&#13;
very deeply when he dictated.     And the story about him--this is absolutely&#13;
a true story--is that he was dictating a memorandum.        I think the&#13;
memorandum was going to go to the Secretary.     He was thinking very deeply&#13;
and walking up and down the room.     He came to the door of his office,&#13;
walked out, found himself in the corridor and went to lunch.        His secretary&#13;
was used to his vanishing but coming back.     She just sat there for about&#13;
three-quarters of a hour while he was out to lunch.        He came back, found&#13;
her sitting there, and wanted to know what she was doing there.           He&#13;
completely forgot that he'd been working on the memorandum.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Sol Adler was sent off to China very early on in 1941 for the Chinese&#13;
Stabilization Board.     He became very, very attracted to the Chinese, stayed&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                               -10-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK)&#13;
there a number of years, and got into trouble during the McCarthy period.&#13;
By this time he was out of the Government, but got in trouble in the&#13;
McCarthy period.    At that point, he was back in Cambridge.    And then he&#13;
went to China to live.     He's been living in China now for about 20 years or&#13;
so, at least.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Did you get to know any of the people in the Monetary Department&#13;
quite well as a friend?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:    Well, I got to know them as friends in the sense that they were&#13;
office friends.     But basically my personal friends were those I'd made in&#13;
the first place I worked:     the Federal Reserve.   Federal Reserve people&#13;
were much more friendly, much more engaging.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Then I started going with Margie Goldenweisser--E. A. Goldenweisser's&#13;
daughter--so that we were socially part of the Federal Reserve, except for&#13;
Irving Friedman.     Irving shared an apartment with me for part of the summer&#13;
before Margie and I got married,     and we continued to be friends with him&#13;
and Edna.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Among the other people at Treasury, there was Phil Brown.     We didn't&#13;
really get to know him very well, but he was there.     His main job was to be&#13;
a speech writer for the Secretary.     Then there was Lud Ullman, who worked&#13;
on commodities.    He was buried off in an office by himself.   He worked on&#13;
the bread and butter of the division:     claims by American firms that&#13;
imported goods were being subsidized by foreign governments or were being&#13;
dumped.     If after investigation the claims were found to be true, the&#13;
Treasury imposed countervailing or anti-dumping duties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    George Willis came in just about the time I was called up.      He was&#13;
brought in to work on international monetary issues.     Eddie Bernstein also&#13;
had been brought in to work on the international monetary policy.      Then&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                               -11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK]&#13;
there was George Eddy, who worked on gold and silver matters.      He also&#13;
worked on ARAMCO--the Arabian-American Oil Company--which was just starting&#13;
up in Saudi Arabia.    We were just beginning to discover the riches of oil&#13;
there, and the Saudis were very unsophisticated financially.      They didn't&#13;
want to get paid in terms of balances at the Federal Reserve Bank in New&#13;
York or anything like that.     They wanted goldi they wanted gold sovereigns.&#13;
They wanted something they could bite between their teeth to make sure it&#13;
was pure gold.     Part of George Eddy's job was to get the sovereigns from&#13;
the British and other gold coins the Saudis wanted.      And George Eddy was&#13;
also technically--at one point he may have been appointed--Director of the&#13;
U.S. Stabilization Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    All of us--all the Monetary Research people--Captain Puleston, Viner&#13;
when he was there, Reiffler and I--we were all being paid basically out of&#13;
the U.S. Stabilization Fund.     The U.S. Stabilization Fund made substantial&#13;
profits.    All the gold purchases and gold sales went through the U.S.&#13;
Stabilization Fund, and any money, any resources that were not tied up in&#13;
gold were invested in Treasury bills or Treasury bonds, so there was a&#13;
substantial income there, and this was used to pay all of us.      So there was&#13;
always technically a Director of the Stabilization Fund.      There had been a&#13;
guy named Merle Cochran, who, before the Stabilization Fund moved over to&#13;
Monetary Research, worked directly for the Secretary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     He later became an Alternate Executive Director, I believe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     No, he became Deputy Managing Director of the International&#13;
Monetary Fund.     He was a Foreign Service Officer.   He had come into the&#13;
Treasury because he had European contacts and so on.      But gradually the&#13;
Stabilization Fund decisions moved into Monetary Research, and Monetary&#13;
Research became the international side of the Treasury.&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                               -12-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Were you aware in these days, late 1941, that some people in the&#13;
Treasury were beginning to think about what later became the Bretton Woods&#13;
organizations?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Well, in 1941, 1942--before I went into the Army--! knew that the&#13;
Treasury was beginning to think about post-war arrangements.        I didn't know&#13;
very much about it.     In fact, I was not terribly interested in knowing&#13;
about it or getting interested or even talking about it, because I thought,&#13;
there's a war going on in Europe.     It was very important that the Allies&#13;
win.     This would be 1941, before we got in, and then, of course, after we&#13;
got in it was terribly important that we win.     Winning the war was the&#13;
important thing.     The question was what we were going to do to win the war.&#13;
To think about what was going to happen post-war was, I thought, just&#13;
dreaming.     It had really nothing to do with realities.     I was not terribly&#13;
interested in it.     I could not imagine, could not understand why people&#13;
could get interested in it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       We were involved with more immediate problems.   The Secretary, for&#13;
example, was very much involved in trying to keep China in the war against&#13;
Japan, to keep Chiang Kai-shek from making a deal with the Japanese.         So&#13;
there was a question of how you kept him in the war.        The Flying&#13;
Tigers--that was a Treasury project.     The Flying Tigers were Secretary&#13;
Morgenthau's project:     first of all, getting the money for Chiang Kai-shek&#13;
so we could hire American pilots and could buy American planes--P-40s--for&#13;
the Flying Tigers.     Then later on, when Chiang Kai-shek had been driven far&#13;
into the interior and there was a real question of whether or not he was&#13;
going to stay in the war or whether he would be quite content to become a&#13;
kind of a war lord under the general overlordship of the Japanese, it was&#13;
quite clear that one of the ways in which we could keep him active in the&#13;
war was by giving him an opportunity to build up his personal fortune.&#13;
This came about, I remember, in early 1942 when the Japanese invaded Malaya&#13;
and headed towards Singapore.&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                  -13-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(KAMARCK]&#13;
       I was involved in this because there was a lot of optimism about how&#13;
the British were going to stop the Japanese and so on.        The British,&#13;
however, were very good in this respect: they fed the Secretary accurate&#13;
information on what was happening, and it was quite clear that the British&#13;
were being driven back relentlessly.        The Japanese were running circles&#13;
around them.     The Japanese actually were not superior in manpower.        They&#13;
were not superior in armaments.        What they were superior in was&#13;
generalship.     So I reported to the Secretary I did not think the British&#13;
were going to be able to hold Singapore.        And based on that--at least&#13;
partly based on that--the Treasury started thinking of what we are going to&#13;
do when Singapore falls and Chiang Kai-shek begins to think the Japanese&#13;
are invincible.     And that point we worked out a program of a major loan to&#13;
China, and the loan went through to China.        The money couldn't be used for&#13;
imports.     There was no way to get imports in.     It was basically a way of&#13;
giving Chiang Kai-shek money which he could use partly to build his own&#13;
family fortune up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Those were the things that were going on in the Treasury.        I couldn't&#13;
see how people could devote attention to worrying about what was going to&#13;
happen after the war.     At that point, it wasn't absolutely clear that we&#13;
were going to have much to say about what was going to happen after the&#13;
war.    The plans that they were making in Berlin and Tokyo might be more&#13;
pertinent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     You've referred a couple of times to your being called up.       Were&#13;
you at that time in the Reserves, or what was your own situation?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Yes, I was a Reserve officer, and I was first contacted in the&#13;
fall of 1940, if I remember correctly, on kind of a volunteer basis.           I'd&#13;
been on maneuvers with a National Guard division that was going to be&#13;
called into Federal service.     I was asked whether or not I would come in&#13;
with them.     I was not interested.&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                 -14-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     You had been in the ROTC?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     I'd been in the ROTC and I had a Reserve Commission in the Field&#13;
Artillery.     Then I was called up.    I got orders to report in the Spring of&#13;
1941.     I told the Secretary I'd gotten the orders, and the Secretary had&#13;
one of his people call up the Army and I was deferred for three months, or&#13;
something of that kind.      I was called up again.   I was deferred again.     In&#13;
fact, at that point the Army set up what they called a General Deferment&#13;
Reserve Pool, or something like that, where they had the people that had&#13;
been deferred sitting there.      Then, after Pearl Harbor, sometime early in&#13;
1942, the Army decided it didn't make sense to have people in the Deferment&#13;
Pool.     So I was informed that I had to make up my mind.    Either I had to&#13;
resign my commission or I had to realize that when I was called up I had to&#13;
go in.     No deferments.   At that point my wife and I had a discussion, and&#13;
we decided that it really wasn't up to us to decide what I should do, but I&#13;
certainly wasn't going to resign my commission. Â·I didn't resign my&#13;
commission, and I got called up in July 1942 into the Field Artillery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    And as part of your service in the Army you wound up in Italy?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Yes.   Well, what happened was I got called into Field Artillery&#13;
and sent to Fort Bragg, where they had the initial indoctrination and&#13;
training     From Fort Bragg I was sent up to the Field Artillery School at&#13;
Fort Sill, where you got further training.      And from Fort Sill you were, at&#13;
that point, assigned to a division.      At Fort Sill, at the Field Artillery&#13;
School, everything was building up a good deal.       And what they were doing&#13;
as each class came through was that they would pick out one, two or three&#13;
people who had done well and shunt them aside into the Field Artillery&#13;
School as instructors.      So I got pulled out and was made an instructor in&#13;
the Field Artillery School.      I was teaching materiel and close combat&#13;
firing.     So there I was in the Field Artillery School as an instructor.&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                -15-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(KAMARCK)&#13;
    When Italy surrendered, the Army had to staff the Control Commission,&#13;
and they went to the Treasury and said one of the elements of the Control&#13;
Commission is going to be the Finance Subcommission and we'd like Treasury&#13;
people for that.     And the Treasury said it's silly for the Army to ask it&#13;
for personnel.     There are already Treasury people in the Armed Forces.&#13;
They gave the Army a list of the people who had been called up.       And so I&#13;
was pulled out of the Field Artillery School for this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    George Willis was in the Navy.      He was pulled out of the Navy.     Earl&#13;
Hicks was in the Coast Guard.      Lane Timmons was somewhere in the Army.       He&#13;
had been at Foreign Funds Control.     And Ed Foley, I think he was in the&#13;
Adjutant General's Office.      Ed Foley had been General Counsel of the&#13;
Treasury.     So he was pulled out of there.   John Lawler was in the Coast&#13;
Guard.     He was pulled out.   We were the nucleus of the Finance&#13;
Subcommission in the Allied Control Commission in Italy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So I never really became a proper Field Artillery officer.        A training&#13;
Field Artillery officer but never actually in a battery in a division.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I'm sure in whatever capacity you served it was proper.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     As I say, Margie and I decided once we got into the war that it&#13;
was up to the U.S. Government to decide where they wanted me to go.         So&#13;
they did.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     But your experience in Italy in the Army then had an effect upon&#13;
things that you did later.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now, let's get you back to the Treasury Department and have you talk&#13;
about what led to your experience in the Marshall Plan.&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                              -16-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:    I was assigned to the Allied Control Council in Germany, and I&#13;
was there until December 1945, when I came back to the United States, into&#13;
the Treasury.    At that point I was assigned to Monetary Research.     The&#13;
Secretary wasn't interested in following the war.      There wasn't any war&#13;
anymore.    And in Monetary Research--which then became the Office of&#13;
International Finance--initially I worked on the various post-war&#13;
settlements we had with the French, the Belgians, the Dutch.       I didn't work&#13;
on the Anglo-American Financial Agreement, because that had been going&#13;
during 1945.    In fact, I think it was signed, ratified in December 1945.&#13;
But we had the settlements with the French.     I was the head of the&#13;
interdepartmental subcommittee on financial settlements.       It was also the&#13;
war claims part.    It was a rather complicated thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Meanwhile the Fund and the Bank were being organized and a number of&#13;
the Treasury people were going over to the Fund and Bank.       Harry White went&#13;
as the U.S. Executive Director in the IMF.    Frank Coe went as the Secretary&#13;
of the Fund.    Irving [S.] Friedman went to be the head of the U.S.-Canadian&#13;
division.    Eddie Bernstein went to be in the Research Department.     Ragnar&#13;
Nurske was supposed to be the Director, but he died.       So Eddie Bernstein&#13;
became the Acting Director and finally became the Director.       Anyhow, these&#13;
people left the Treasury.    I was given the job of head of the NAC&#13;
Secretariat--National Advisory Council on International Monetary and&#13;
Financial Problems.    This was an organization that     was set up in the&#13;
legislation that approved the U.S. participation in the Fund and the Bank.&#13;
The purpose of it was, among other things, to coordinate the policy--to&#13;
coordinate the instruction that the U.S. Government gave to the U.S.&#13;
Executive Directors on the Fund and the Bank.    And it also was given the&#13;
job to coordinate American international financial and monetary policy,&#13;
which meant coordinating decisions on loans, coordinating decisions on the&#13;
position the U.S. took on foreign exchange rate matters and so on.       So&#13;
that, for example, all the Export-Import Bank loans had to go through the&#13;
Council.    The various temporary aid arrangements that were made for&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                               -17-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK)&#13;
countries went through the NAC.     It was a very active organization, and it&#13;
was a marvelous organization.     For the first time the U.S. Government was&#13;
really coordinated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It had a three-tier arrangement.     At the top was the Cabinet-level&#13;
committee presided over by the Secretary of the Treasury.     The Secretary of&#13;
State, Secretary of Commerce, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,&#13;
and the President of the Export-Import Bank were all members.     Below that&#13;
was what was called the NAC Staff Committee.     And these were the top people&#13;
at the technical level from each of the departments, so that at that time&#13;
you had, from the Export-Import Bank, Gus Maffry; from the State&#13;
Department, Norman Ness; from the Federal Reserve Board, Burke Knapp.       I&#13;
was the Chair, and we also had a Treasury representative on the Committee.&#13;
Below the Staff Committee we had working parties so that, for example, when&#13;
any particular action came up, any particular country, all of the people in&#13;
the Government who were experts on that country were on the working party,&#13;
and would assemble all the technical data and the economic and financial&#13;
data that was needed that pertained to a particular policy issue and then&#13;
went on from there.     So this NAC machinery was then used to do the Marshall&#13;
Plan, to do the economic and financial part of the Marshall Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     What do you mean by the economic and financial part of the&#13;
Marshall Plan?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Well, for example it meant trying to make estimates of what the&#13;
needs of the different countries were going to be for aid.     It meant&#13;
deciding on what terms and conditions that aid was going to be given.       It&#13;
included, among other things, what kind of foreign exchange rate policy we&#13;
should expect from the countries.    You had this very complicated situation,&#13;
for example, in Belgium.     Belgium did not have, and it was not expected to&#13;
have, a balance of payments deficit overall.     Belgium had a problem in that&#13;
it could export and sell in Europe, but it had to import from the United&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                  -18-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK]&#13;
States.     So the result is it had a dollar problem, but it didn't have a&#13;
balance of payments problem.        The question was how was that going to be&#13;
handled, and whether we should provide grant aid to Belgium.        If we&#13;
provided grant aid to Belgium to cover the dollar gap, they were going to&#13;
have balance of payments surplus in European currencies.        What happened&#13;
then?     We had problems of that kind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Did you have a staff that was working with you to make estimates&#13;
as to overall exports and imports of the Europeans?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     By this time the Division of Monetary Research was called the&#13;
Office of International Finance.        In the Office of International Finance&#13;
there were country experts.       There was Larry Hebbard, for example, on the&#13;
United Kingdom.        I don't remember offhand the names of the other people,&#13;
but you had in each case people who were supposed to know and did know the&#13;
country.     When we had to consider, for example, a problem affecting the&#13;
United Kingdom, Larry Hebbard would be the chairman of the working party,&#13;
and the working party would be made up of people from the Federal Reserve&#13;
Board, one or two people from the State Department, from the Commerce&#13;
Department, Agriculture Department--Agriculture was brought in on the&#13;
working party--and the Export-Import Bank.        They would prepare a working&#13;
party paper, and then based on that there would be a policy paper prepared.&#13;
And that policy paper would be based on that, with the initial draft&#13;
modified as a result of the NAC Staff Committee meeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Well, did it always turn out that the estimates of the total&#13;
exports of the European countries were equal to the total imports?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Oh, no.    When it came to the Marshall Plan we had to make&#13;
estimates, forecasts of the balance of trade and balance of payments of&#13;
each European country and then try to put the whole thing together to get&#13;
some idea of what total aid from the United States was needed.&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                               -19-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK)&#13;
    The State Department had made an attempt--because the idea of the&#13;
Marshall Plan came out of the State Department--to try to keep the whole&#13;
preparation of the Marshall Plan within the State Department.        They worked&#13;
very hard and they came up with a whole series of individual country&#13;
estimates.     The only problem was when you put them all together what you&#13;
had were estimates of intra-European exports totalling more than intra-&#13;
European imports.     So you had a logically impossible surplus.&#13;
Unfortunately Charley Kindleberger, who was central in this work, got&#13;
labeled with that surplus.     Larry Hebbard at one point said, "Ahh," he&#13;
said, "what you have is a Kindleburger surplus."     And it got called the&#13;
Kindleberger surplus all during the Marshall Plan period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The State Department just threw up its hands.     They just couldn't&#13;
handle it.     Their results were ridiculed and so the problem was thrown into&#13;
the NAC machinery.     And it was thrown in the NAC machinery over a weekend,&#13;
Saturday and Sunday.     People from all over the Government wereÂ· brought in&#13;
to work on country working parties to do these estimates.       And, of course,&#13;
the country experts tended to overestimate exports and underestimate&#13;
imports, resulting in a Kindleberger surplus.     But at that point George&#13;
Willis, who was supervising these country working parties, would walk up&#13;
and down the corridor peddling these quote, surplus, unquote, exports to&#13;
get the country experts to accept them as import so the whole thing would&#13;
balance out.     So that NAC came up with a series of balance-of-payments&#13;
estimates which could not be faulted on technical grounds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     The original estimates of the amount of aid the United States&#13;
might have to give for the Marshall Plan to coincide with what actually&#13;
turned out?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Well, it started off with initial estimates.     Meanwhile, the&#13;
Europeans were also making their estimates in Paris.        And the came up with&#13;
a total of some $30 billion as the amount of U.S. aid needed for the&#13;
period.     Harold Spiegel from the State Department, who had been working&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                  -20-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK]&#13;
with Willard Thorpe and the Europeans in Paris, came back with that. We had&#13;
a small committee which was called Top Workmen European Recovery Program,&#13;
to make the acronym TWERP.        It was an informal committee, the State&#13;
Department and the Treasury basically.          I'm not sure if anybody else was&#13;
involved in it.        But Harold Spiegle, George Willis and I were involved.      We&#13;
had to decide what we were going to do, what figure we were going to come&#13;
up with.     We decided very quickly that $30 billion was an absurd figure, so&#13;
what we decided on was that about $15 or $16 billion should be about&#13;
right--economically and politically.        And then George Willis went back to&#13;
the country working parties and informed them that this is more or less the&#13;
amount of total aid that's going to come in.         Can your country do it on&#13;
your share?     And they did.     So the whole thing came together on that basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Meanwhile, there had been three non-governmental committees set up at a&#13;
very high level.       One of the committees had representatives from academia,&#13;
from the banks, from industry and so on.         This was the Harriman Committee,&#13;
chaired by the Secretary of Commerce Harriman, with Richard Bissell as&#13;
Executive Director.       He finally wound up as Deputy Director of the CIA.       He&#13;
was the technical secretary of this committee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Bissel?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Bissel.    Richard Bissel was the technical secretary of this&#13;
committee.     He was supposed to prepare estimates for the committee.        He&#13;
came over to the Treasury at NAC, and we went over the estimates with him.&#13;
So the Harriman Committee came up with a set of estimates which were&#13;
consistent with our estimates.       This gave a great deal of credibility to&#13;
the whole exercise, because here you had two separate groups that had&#13;
developed the same set of estimates.       And actually the estimates weren't&#13;
bad, because it turned out the Marshall Plan basically was completed for&#13;
thirteen-and-a-half billion dollars.        The figure that the Congress, I&#13;
think, operated on was fifteen billion dollars, so actually the Marshall&#13;
Plan came in for less than our estimate.         So we did pretty well.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I think it's of some interest to note--I'm sure wholly by&#13;
coincidence--that estimates made at the time as to the debit balance that&#13;
the rest of the world might run up with the United States as the sole&#13;
credit-balance nation if Keynes' Clearing Union proposal had been accepted&#13;
was in the neighborhood of $31 billion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Interesting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Andy, I wonder if we might turn now to.a somewhat different&#13;
subject.     You spent a fair amount of your time in the World Bank being&#13;
Economic Adviser to the Africa Area department or to the various&#13;
subdivisions of Africa, and I was wondering what you might care to say&#13;
about your experiences in that regard, and if you would say a bit about the&#13;
exploratory missions that you participated in, in particular to various&#13;
African and other countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Well, I had been Economic Adviser to the Department of Europe,&#13;
Africa and Australasia.     Then, when there was an explosion of new African&#13;
countries gaining their independence from about 1960 on, a new Africa&#13;
Department was set up with Pierre Moussa at the head, John Williams as the&#13;
Assistant Director and me as the Economic Adviser.     I should mention&#13;
Leonard Rist had been appointed before that as a kind of Special Ambassador&#13;
to Africa, and he had visited most of these African countries before they&#13;
became members.     In essence he was going out and educating them about the&#13;
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and what they needed to do&#13;
in order to become members.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Â·But when one country did become a member, we would generally try to&#13;
send a mission go out and look over the economic situation and also try to&#13;
ascertain what the Bank could and should do in the country.     I headed a lot&#13;
of these missions.     In fact, basically I wanted to do all of them, but I&#13;
couldn't.&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                 -22-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK)&#13;
    The initial missions would have some representatives from the Projects&#13;
Department to look at the different sectors and try to decide where the&#13;
Bank ought to start operations.       Generally before leaving the country we&#13;
would have discussions with the government where we would say, "Well, of&#13;
course, we're not committing the Bank; we don't know what the Bank's&#13;
decision is going to be, but what we're going to recommend is that the it&#13;
consider lending here and lending here.        The priorities seem to us to be&#13;
transport or agriculture or education,"-- whatever the case might be.&#13;
Usually the Projects people would have sat down with the particular sector&#13;
that we thought we ought to start with and try to work out particular&#13;
projects so that when we came back and reported to the Loan Committee and&#13;
the Economic Committee that this country is creditworthy and we ought to be&#13;
able to do something here.     We would also recommend that we should start&#13;
with this sector and here's a proposed project.       So the thing could move&#13;
quite rapidly.     That's about it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Well, do you want to say something about your experiences in&#13;
exploratory missions in some European countries?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Yes, the situation was quite different in the European countries.&#13;
For example, shortly after Spain joined the Fund and the Bank, we had an&#13;
exploratory mission there.     This was composed of Dick [Richard H.) Demuth&#13;
as the head.     I was there on the economic side.    And Ernesto Franco-Holguin&#13;
was from the Area department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We quickly discovered that there was a group of very able technocrats&#13;
in the ministries who had what we concluded were very good ideas of what&#13;
ought to be done to the economy.      They were frustrated because they really&#13;
couldn't get through to convince their ministers or to Generalissimo Franco&#13;
to take the necessary policy steps.      There was a considerable amount of&#13;
inflation.     The inflation was basically due to the fact that there was an&#13;
organization called INI, a copy of IRI in Italy, for setting up and&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                   -23-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK]&#13;
investing in state-owned industries.         It was headed by Suances, a childhood&#13;
friend of the Generalissimo's.     INI investments in the industrial sector&#13;
were obviously poorly thought out.         The economics generally was bad, and&#13;
very often the plain technical aspects of it were bad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We visited one shipyard that INI was building.         It was way up a river,&#13;
and it was clear that if the shipyard were to build the ships that it was&#13;
being constructed for, they'd never be able to get out to sea.         Stupidities&#13;
of that kind were all around.     INI was being financed by drawing on the&#13;
Bank of Spain.    The Bank of Spain couldn't say no to INI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We found that the economy was tied up in knots.         Franco had been trying&#13;
to imitate Fascist Italy with all of its controls.         If a textile firm in&#13;
Barcelona got an order for textiles from a customer abroad, it had to clear&#13;
with Madrid to get approval.     And this would take weeks and weeks and&#13;
weeks.    By the time it all came through, the customer would have moved on.&#13;
The whole economy was just bound up in red tape and bureaucratic&#13;
regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    At any rate, after looking the whole situation over, we came back, and&#13;
we recommended to [Eugene] Black, who was the President of the World Bank&#13;
at the time, that what really needed to be done was a major reform in&#13;
Spain; it didn't make any sense to lend any money there until they did&#13;
something to stop the inflation, to open the economy, to get rid of all&#13;
these regulations, and to change the exchange rate.         Black sent a letter to&#13;
Generalissimo Franco right along these lines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We had discussions with the Fund immediately thereafter.         The Deputy&#13;
Managing Director at that time was Merle Cochran, and we told him what we&#13;
were recommending.   Cochran said,   11&#13;
                                          Well, you people don't realize how long&#13;
it takes to get anything like this done.         In the case of Turkey, we've been&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                               -24-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK]&#13;
working with them for about 10 or 15 years trying to get them to stop their&#13;
inflation.    We're making progress, but it's very, very slow.      You can't&#13;
really do this thing overnight."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The OECD sent a mission to Spain, and it made the same recommendations.&#13;
Then the Fund's mission made similar recommendations.        At any rate, Franco&#13;
was impressed with all this.     He gave these technocrats their head.     They&#13;
opened up the economy.     They changed the exchange rate.     They stopped the&#13;
inflation.    And bango, Spain just took off.   The result was they were much&#13;
better off than if we had come back and said, "Look, there's all kinds of&#13;
capital needs in Spain, and we should have an enormous lending program."&#13;
If we had poured a lot of money in there, the money would have had little&#13;
impact on the whole situation.     Whereas, this did.    We then could go in and&#13;
make loans to rehabilitate the Spanish railways, and the whole thing went&#13;
very well.    So that was what you could do in Europe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    When you came to Africa, the situation was different.       Macroeconomics&#13;
wasn't anywhere near as important.     In the French-speaking countries, they&#13;
didn't have their own central bank.     There was one central bank for about&#13;
six French-speaking countries and another central bank for another group of&#13;
French-speaking countries.     Both of these were headquartered in Paris and&#13;
headed by Frenchmen.     The foreign exchange rate was tied to the French&#13;
franc.    Their treasuries were pretty much controlled by the French&#13;
Government. Within the ministries were some capable people, including quite&#13;
a few Frenchmen operating there.     So you could make effective investments&#13;
within the sectors.    But most of the levers of macroeconomics, fiscal&#13;
policy, central banking policy basically didn't exist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In the English-speaking countries, you didn't have strong,&#13;
well-administered, well-managed governments.     So again basically it didn't&#13;
make too much sense to talk about macroeconomic policy, planning policy and&#13;
so on.    You could have a lot of impact working project by project, or&#13;
sector by sector, but not very much in major policy reforms across the&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                               -25-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK]&#13;
board as, for example, you could do in Spain or other European countries.&#13;
There was a different kettle of fish completely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     So balance of payments lending to African countries would have&#13;
probably made little sense.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     It would have made very little sense.   The real problem was&#13;
having the managers, technicians, the foremen, the skilled workers on hand&#13;
to support some kind of investment.     If you didn't have these, you really&#13;
couldn't do anything.     It didn't make that much difference what financial&#13;
resources you tried to pour into the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I understand that Algeria was an interesting African state, in&#13;
part because George Woods, when he was President of the Bank, was very much&#13;
opposed to the detailed operation of the economy as it was managed by the&#13;
state, and that this initially stood in the way at least of Bank loans to&#13;
Algeria.     Does this ring a bell?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Algeria, in my view, was mishandled from the very beginning.&#13;
What was needed was basically to get acquainted with what was really going&#13;
on in Algeria and to get the Algerians acquainted with the Bank and learn&#13;
to trust the Bank.     What was needed was to handle it the way Tunisia was&#13;
handled.     When Tunisia joined the Bank, the Tunisians regarded themselves&#13;
as revolutionaries.     They didn't trust the Bank, but we had a series&#13;
of small Bank missions there, getting acquainted with Tunisians, educating&#13;
the Tunisians, and starting off with very small loans in sectors where we&#13;
could make some kind of a contribution.      And gradually the Tunisians got to&#13;
know us, to trust us, and we got to know and trust the Tunisians, and it&#13;
built up into a substantial lending program over the years.      And Tunisia, I&#13;
believe, is still one of the countries that the Bank works best with,&#13;
because the relationship was established on a good, solid basis from the&#13;
beginning.&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                               -26-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK]&#13;
    In Algeria, the first mission that went out was enormous.     It was&#13;
composed only partly of Bank people.     There were representatives from&#13;
practically every international agency under the sun.     The Algerians were&#13;
invaded by this army.     The Algerians, as a result, got very big ideas as to&#13;
what was supposed to happen.    And, of course, the Bank really had no&#13;
intention of carrying out a major program in Algeria.     The result was that&#13;
for a long period of time nothing happened, and there was distrust on both&#13;
sides.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I think earlier in my question I was referring the fact that&#13;
George Woods had wanted development finance companies to finance private,&#13;
essentially privately-owned enterprises.     In the case of petroleum or other&#13;
industries he felt that if there were private entrepreneurs or capitalists&#13;
available to lend private capital the Bank should not become involved.&#13;
Therefore, on two scores in Algeria, he felt that the Algerian Government,&#13;
which owned and operated a very large part of the economy in those days,&#13;
was not eligible for Bank loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:    Well, the description you gave of Bank policy vis-a-vis the oil&#13;
sector, was and is correct.     It is no longer, but it was correct for a long&#13;
period of time under Black and Woods and certainly for some years under&#13;
McNamara.    The feeling was that the oil companies had enormous resources.&#13;
They were accustomed to taking risks, going into politically threatening&#13;
situations, and there was no case for the Bank to get involved in that&#13;
sector.     In recent years, the Bank has been involved, at first in helping&#13;
governments do the preliminary reconnaissance in the oil sector.     I think&#13;
now the Bank actually goes in and helps countries invest in producing and&#13;
refining oil, but for many years it did not make a great deal of sense.        I&#13;
think the policy wasÂ· right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I think in Algeria there was at least one other problem that arose as&#13;
AlgeÂ·ri!l was getting independence.   There had been one million Frenchmen who&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                 -27-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK]&#13;
had been there, or people who had French nationality.       They had been the&#13;
managers.     They had been the technicians.   They had been the skilled&#13;
workers.     They had even in many cases driven the taxis and so on.       They had&#13;
been the managers and the owners of the farms.      And they had all left. The&#13;
Algerians took all this over    an~   they took it over by making collective&#13;
farms, or by putting in worker management, and in other cases, state&#13;
ownership.     It was a very chaotic situation at the time.   The Bank had&#13;
learned to work with Yugoslavia.       It had a major lending program in&#13;
Yugoslavia, so that ownership would not by itself have turned the Bank off.&#13;
But it was very clear that there was sufficient uncertainty and chaos in&#13;
Algeria that it was going to take time to work out with the Algerians what&#13;
was the best way for the Bank to help Algeria.      It was not something you&#13;
could dash in and and bango, there was a program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I have in my notes the subject of public finance in connection&#13;
with the Economics Department.     What can we say about that?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     Well, one of the fields that the other parts of the Bank looked&#13;
to the Economics Department for help in was an examination of the public&#13;
finance sector in the countries that missions were going to and countries&#13;
that the Area departments were operating in.      Shortly after the Economics&#13;
Department was organized, it began to get requests fromÂ·the Area&#13;
departments saying we're going to send a mission to the Sudan, or we're&#13;
going to have a mission to India, and so on, and we'd like to have somebody&#13;
look at the public finance sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We had to decide how to handle those requests.      Because the Fund had a&#13;
large department with 25 or 30 professionals in the public finance sector,&#13;
and because they had been in this field for a long time, rather than build&#13;
up a large group of people in the Bank, we finally decided, in agreement&#13;
with Dick [Richard] Goode, the Director of the Fund's Fiscal Affairs&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                  -28-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK]&#13;
Department, that the Bank's Economics Department would build up a division&#13;
of eight or nine people, and these eight or nine people would give us&#13;
capability in the field and to do missions when the Fund could not help.&#13;
But basically the Fund would provide the experts to go on Bank country&#13;
missions to do the public finance sector studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We met with Dick Goode once a month.         Dick Goode would come with one of&#13;
his people to meet with me and the head of the Public Finance Division in&#13;
the Economics Department.        We would lay out the program for country&#13;
missions over the next two or three months.         We always had considerable&#13;
lead time and could determine whether or not Area departments wanted&#13;
somebody on their mission, whether we felt it was worthwhile to have&#13;
somebody on the mission, whether they did or did not ask us for something,&#13;
whether or not the Fund had done any work on the country, and whether the&#13;
Fund could provide somebody who could do the job.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And so we scheduled the Fund people into the Bank missions to carry out&#13;
this work, and it worked very well.       We had a few hitches at the beginning,&#13;
but it worked.     The Fund was satisfied.      We were satisfied.   It made it&#13;
possible for us to do a lot in this field without having to hire a lot of&#13;
people.     The Fund was happy to be able to work with us this way.      We both&#13;
got the kind of information that we needed.         It was a very useful exercise,&#13;
and it continued the whole time I was in the Economics Department.          After I&#13;
left the Economics Department, it fell apart.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I understand that in the meetings of the Economic Committee, Fund&#13;
people frequently were invited to make comments about project proposals of&#13;
various countries.     Do you recall that?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:    No.   No, I don't.     In fact I think it would have been extremely&#13;
rare for that to have happened.&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                               -29-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     The last question I wanted to ask about deals with the EDI, the&#13;
Economic Development Institute, which I think was your last major&#13;
assignment prior to your retirement.     What would you care to say about your&#13;
period with the EDI and how you viewed your going to EDI from the Economics&#13;
Department?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     For quite a number of years, even before I became Director of the&#13;
Economics Department, I had felt that I would like before leaving the Bank&#13;
to become Director of the EDI.     I liked it for a number of reasons.     The&#13;
EDI was and still is a fairly autonomous organization.     It works very&#13;
closely with the Bank and it makes great use of the Bank.     It makes a great&#13;
contribution to the Bank, but basically it's left pretty much to itself in&#13;
making its plans and programs--in coordination with the Bank and the rest&#13;
of it.     It does have a great deal of independence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Second; it doesn't have the hectic pace of the Bank.     It isn't as&#13;
contemplative or detached as a university can be, but it is not the same&#13;
burly burly as the Bank.     So it is a very good place for people who've been&#13;
involved in Bank operations to lift themselves above the day-to-day, even&#13;
the month-to-month anxieties and programs to get some idea of direction, of&#13;
strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    As the years went on in the Bank, I became more and more convinced that&#13;
the most important ingredient in economic development was people and that&#13;
the difference between the record of one country and another, all other&#13;
things being equal, was economic management.     Economic management was&#13;
really a key.    A country could have all the resources in the world--plenty&#13;
of natural resources, financial resources, all kinds of opportunities-- but&#13;
if it was not managed well, it was not going to develop.     Mmanagement&#13;
includes macromanagement, micromanagement, sector management, project&#13;
management.     The skills and attitudes of people in enterprises and farmers&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMA.RCK                              -Jo-Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK]&#13;
in the fields are fundamental.     And the one part in the Bank that was&#13;
devoted to training people was ED!.     I thought that the EDI could do a lot&#13;
more than it was doing.     It had been growing, but it had been growing&#13;
fairly slowly.     I thought that one could do a lot more if one tried to use&#13;
the EDI as a multiplier instead of retail, one by one.       This is important,&#13;
very important, but at the same time, if the EDI helps to train people to&#13;
run courses to train people in the developing countries, one could have a&#13;
much greater impact.     So these are the reasons I wanted to go to the EDI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    When I came into the Economics Department, I sat down and laid out a&#13;
list of things that I wanted to accomplish.       I had just come back after&#13;
having been away at UCLA, where I'd been able to do a fair amount of&#13;
reading and thinking.     So I came with a lot of energy, intellectual, mental&#13;
and physical energy and a lot of ideas.       After having been Director of the&#13;
Economics Department for about five years and building a large department&#13;
practically from scratch and getting it established in the Bank against the&#13;
inertial and even the active opposition of many Bank officials, I was&#13;
exhausted.    Most of what I'd wanted to accomplish had been accomplished.&#13;
At that point I felt I'd done just about as much as I could.        One of my&#13;
goals had been to get sabbaticals established in the Bank.        We had just&#13;
succeeded, and the first couple of people were going off on sabbatical.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Then we had a change in the management of the economics sector.         Irving&#13;
Friedman, the Economic Adviser to the President, had been seriously ill and&#13;
was leaving on sabbatical.     Hollis Chenery had come in for about six&#13;
months.     Hollis Chenery was thinking about a reorganization.     I recommended&#13;
that the Economics Department, which had gotten very big, should be broken&#13;
up into several departments.     I did not want one of the departments.     I did&#13;
not want to be deputy to Hollis.     As a matter of fact, I had not wanted&#13;
Irving Friedman's job, or Hollis' job, either.      I did not like the idea of&#13;
working that closely and at the beck and call of the President of the Bank.&#13;
I wanted a semi-autonomous, semi-independent system of my own.       Like&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                                  -31-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[KAMARCK]&#13;
Caesar, I preferred.to be first in a provincial town than second in Rome.&#13;
The term of the Director of EDI was going to be up in the course of the&#13;
year, so I asked to become the Director of EDI with a year off to prepare&#13;
for it, a year's sabbatical.     McNamara agreed to that.       So I went off and&#13;
had my year's sabbatical at Harvard, came back, began with an agenda for&#13;
EDI and set to work on that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Can you recall offhand several of the objectives that you had in&#13;
mind when you came back from UCLA and knew you were going to be head of the&#13;
Economics Department?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     The Economics Department?    Well, let me think.    Sabbaticals for&#13;
staff was one of my goals.     Another was to have an economic section in the&#13;
Annual Report.     It was absurd for the Bank to be putting out annual reports&#13;
that were just pure operations reports.         The Bank was an international&#13;
financial development institution, and it didn't present any analysis of&#13;
the economic or development progress or problems in the world.          The&#13;
economic section, once incorporated in the Annual Report, went on to&#13;
develop into the World Development Report the Bank puts out.         Making it&#13;
independent of the Annual Report became necessary when the Executive&#13;
Directors successfully insisted that the Annual Report was their statement.&#13;
The World Development Report thus became the staff's expression of views.&#13;
We set up a data bank of statistics on the different countries, which was&#13;
the source of the World Bank Atlas and the World Tables.         I started a&#13;
publication program and revived the moribund Bank Publications Committee.&#13;
Basically there wasn't much of a research program in the Bank, and I wanted&#13;
to get some research started.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     When you say research in this sense, are you distinguishing&#13;
research that is clearly related to operations, as must have been being&#13;
done by the economic advisers to the various Area departments, from a more&#13;
leisurely, Olympian if you   w~ll,   academic type research?&#13;
&amp;#12;KAMARCK                               -32-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:    No.   The Area departments were producing country reports.     The&#13;
country reports were research, but not in depth.     There was very little in&#13;
the way of long-term look at a country in its history and its long-term&#13;
problems and progress.     There was no research on comparative economic&#13;
performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Very little cross-country analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:    Very little cross-country analysis.   There was very little.     In&#13;
the Projects Department the techniques of project and sector analysis&#13;
hadn't been developed very much.     In terms of sectors, a lot of the basic&#13;
information really wasn't there.     There were people who had experience and&#13;
had judgement as to whether this would work and that wouldn't in a concrete&#13;
case, but it wasn't based on any kind of research and was not available to&#13;
others.    In fact, practically everywhere you looked the Bank worked from&#13;
day to day, and economists worked from day to day.     There wasn't any&#13;
research in depth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    I understand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:    So this is something that I wanted to get started.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Well, it seems to me I've kept you talking for quite a while in a&#13;
very interesting conversation.     Let me thank you very much for your&#13;
hospitality and for this very interesting conversation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:    Thank you.&#13;

            In July 1986, Andrew Kamarck was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert Oliver. During his tenure at the
            Bank from 1950 to 1979, Mr. Kamarck worked in the following
            areas: as an economic advisor in the departments of
            operations for Europe, Africa, and Australasia (1952-1962)
            and for Africa (1962-1965); as a director for the economics
            department (1965-1971) and for the Economics Development
            Institute (EDI) (1972-1977); and as a senior fellow for EDI
            (1977-1979). His transcript concerns his experiences working
            at the Federal Reserve and for the Marshall Plan before
            working for the World Bank. He also discusses various loans
            to Africa, including mishandled loans to Algeria and
            Tunisia, and the lack of cross-country analysis in the
            project departments of the World Bank.
