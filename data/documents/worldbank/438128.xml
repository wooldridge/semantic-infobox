FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on international capital and economic development.&#13;
Prepared as background papers for World Development Report 1985,&#13;
the series provides more detailed treatment and documentation of&#13;
the issues dealt with in the Report. The papers cover a range of&#13;
topics including a historical perspective on international capital&#13;
and economic development; the effects of policies in industrial&#13;
and developing countries on international capital flows, external&#13;
debt, and economic development; and the role of official&#13;
assistance, commercial bank lending, securities markets, and&#13;
private direct investment in developing countries. Several&#13;
studies of individual developing countries are also included in&#13;
the series.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published&#13;
and unpublished studies of individual researchers, on World Bank&#13;
policy analysis and research, and on reports of other organ-&#13;
izations working on these issues. The papers are the work of&#13;
individuals and the views and interpretations expressed in them do&#13;
not necessarily coincide with the views and interpretations of the&#13;
Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement World&#13;
Development Report 1985 in furthering understanding of the&#13;
relationship between international capital and economic develop-&#13;
ment. A complete list of the papers appears on the overleaf.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
Drawing together hitherto scattered material, the paper&#13;
attempts to present an integrated picture of the activities of&#13;
Arab  financial  institutions  in developing countries.   Most of&#13;
these activities--whether official aid, commercial credits, or&#13;
direct investments--seem to have been triggered by the capital&#13;
surplus in a number of oil exporting countries during the 1970s.&#13;
The study thus begins by considering the deployment of the capital&#13;
surplus so as to place the activities of Arab financial&#13;
institutions in developing countries in the proper context.   The&#13;
discussion then turns to the development of Arab financial&#13;
institutions in the light of Kuwait's experience as the earliest&#13;
capital surplus country.   The mechanisms and institutions that&#13;
Kuwait devised during the 1950s and 1960s to manage its capital&#13;
surplus help to explain the international activities of the&#13;
financial institutions from other capital surplus countries during&#13;
the 1970s and 1980s.   The study concludes by assessing future&#13;
prospects of Arab financial institutions in developing countries&#13;
in regard to Arab/OPEC aid, Islamic banks, and participation in&#13;
syndicated loans, Eurobonds, and direct investments.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
Until recently, many observers considered "OPEC capital" a new factor&#13;
in international finance, investment, and development. Between 1973 and 1984,&#13;
numerous developing countries in particular came to depend increasingly on the&#13;
flows of aid, trade, workers' remittances, commercial credits, and direct&#13;
investments from OPEC countries. With the current decline in oil revenues and&#13;
the associated budgetary constraints on members of the Organization of&#13;
Petroleum Exporting  Countries  (OPEC),  however,  the growing public opinion&#13;
seems  to  be  that  OPEC  capital  is  a passing  phenomenon.   Now  that  the&#13;
prosperity of the OPEC economies is at stake, many developing countries are&#13;
beginning to sense potential hazards to their own economies.  Their reliance&#13;
on OPEC capital is the subject of this paper.&#13;
As the OPEC capital surplus has been dominated by Arab countries, the&#13;
paper concentrates on the activities of Arab financial institutions in&#13;
developing countries. Those institutions were established during a relatively&#13;
short period of time and have become active in both developed and developing&#13;
countries.   As  section I points out,  the extent  of their involvement  in&#13;
developing countries can be ascertained from the deployment  of the total&#13;
surplus over time among alternative channels.   The section also attempts to&#13;
identify  the  principles  of managing  the  surplus  among  those  alternative&#13;
channels.&#13;
As a participant in international finance and investment since the&#13;
1950s, and aid since the early 1960s, Kuwait was one of the first countries&#13;
there to develop a network of financial institutions to manage the flow of&#13;
Kuwaiti capital over time, especially to developing countries. The lessons of&#13;
the Kuwaiti case are highlighted in section II because of their special&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
relevance for the development of financial institutions in other parts of the&#13;
Arab region.&#13;
Using Kuwait as a model, section III considers the financial&#13;
challenges and opportunities of the 1970s and early 1980s that led Arab&#13;
financial institutions to establish presence outside their respective home&#13;
countries.   Of particular interest here are Islamic banks and the spread of&#13;
Arab banks outside the Arab region, not only in centers of international&#13;
finance but also in many developing countries.&#13;
These background details will provide the context for the subsequent&#13;
discussion of the activities of Arab financial institutions in developing&#13;
countries. Their activities are divided into two types: those concerned with&#13;
concessional aid flows, including the cofinancing oE projects (section IV);&#13;
and those concerned with direct investments and commercial credits, including&#13;
internationally syndicated loans and internationally managed bonds (section&#13;
V). The study concludes with an outline of future prospects of Arab financial&#13;
institutions with respect to aid flows, Islamic banking, direct investments,&#13;
and participation in syndicated Eurocurrency loans and multiple currency&#13;
bonds, especially for agencies from developing countries.&#13;
I. Developing Countries and the Capital Surplus&#13;
Despite the financial revenues that place per capita GNP in some OPEC&#13;
countries among the highest in the world, OPEC countries are developing&#13;
countries according to other socioeconomic indicators.   In fact, most were&#13;
faced with  financial  constraints  right up until  1970.   Then  in 1971-73,&#13;
following a period of oil price stability during the 1960s, oil prices rose&#13;
moderately.   These increments were significant in more ways than one.  They&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
signaled   the   increased   bargaining   power   of   OPEC  as  a  collective&#13;
organization.   And, together with expanded oil exports,  they increased oil&#13;
revenue flows to the oil exporters at hitherto unprecedented rates.   These&#13;
developments shifted income distribution on a global scale from oil importers&#13;
to oil exporters.   By 1973, the financial constraints to the development of&#13;
the oil-exporting countries had eased considerably, and a surplus began to&#13;
appear on the current account balance of several OPEC members.  To provide a&#13;
perspective for OPEC's financial placements in developing countries, this&#13;
section examines the following aspects of this phenomenon: the accumulation of&#13;
surplus,   its  deployment   among  countries   and  instruments,   investment&#13;
strategies, and the principles involved in its management.&#13;
The Accumulation of Surplus&#13;
By and large, the profile of OPEC's collective oil revenues follows&#13;
oil price developments. These can be divided into five periods:&#13;
1965-70: oil price stability&#13;
1971-73: gradual increases in oil prices&#13;
1974-78: the aftermath of the first major oil price increase&#13;
1979-81: the aftermath of the second major oil price increase&#13;
1982-84: falling oil prices&#13;
During 1965-70, total oil revenues for OPEC countries averaged about&#13;
US$13 billion per annum. The succession of oil price increases during 1971-73&#13;
pushed OPEC's oil revenues to US$40 billion by the end of 1973.  Significant&#13;
as these increases may have been, they were dwarfed by the increments that&#13;
catapulted oil revenues to US$121 billion in 1974, and to a peak of US$295&#13;
billion in 1980. By 1984, however oil revenues had declined sharply to US$170&#13;
billion.   These nominal figures give some idea of the volume of financial&#13;
flows involved in the global redistribution of income in favor of OPEC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-.4-&#13;
countries up until 1980 and the subsequent reversal of that process during the&#13;
early 1980s.   Developing countries lost the most in the earlier rounds of&#13;
redistribution and gained the least in the later rounds.&#13;
The earlier flows (1971-81) helped OPEC countries finance major&#13;
expansions in their own imports, government consumption, modernization and&#13;
upgrading  of  the  armed  forces,  and development  programs.    In  some OPEC&#13;
countries,  they also helped initiate or expand major programs of external&#13;
assistance and wealth redistribution.   Even so, these various expenditures&#13;
failed to absorb the incoming funds, with the resalt that national savings&#13;
exceeded domestic investments.   After 1981 the process began to turn around&#13;
among the OPEC countries, though understandably in varying degrees.&#13;
Although the surplus accumulation has been reasonably well documented&#13;
for OPEC as a whole, the estimates for individual countries are less reliable&#13;
and  often  controversial.       One  of  the  institutions  to  collect  data&#13;
systematically has been the Bank of England, whose records show a cumulative&#13;
OPEC surplus of US$433 billion at the end of 1983.   The Bank could only&#13;
account for US$378 billion, however, and thus US$55 billion was attributed to&#13;
unidentified uses. 11 A recent Brookings study thal: estimated the surplus by&#13;
country as it stood in 1982 has distinguished between the so-called low&#13;
absorbers and high absorbers. 21  The share of the low absorbers as a group&#13;
was 93 percent of the total surplus, whereas the share of the high absorbers&#13;
as a group was a mere 7 percent.  Among the low absorbers, the largest shares&#13;
were those of Saudi Arabia (47 percent of the total) and Kuwait (24&#13;
percent).  Among the high absorbers, the largest shares were those of Iran (9&#13;
percent) and Iraq (6 percent), but there were also large debtors, notably&#13;
Algeria, Indonesia, and Nigeria. 31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The net foreign assets of the OPEC countries changed with the major&#13;
changes in oil prices.   In 1973, the level of identified surplus was about&#13;
US$21 billion.   During 1974-78, the cumulative surplus increased by US$198&#13;
billion, and during 1979-82 it increased by US$257 billion.  The decline of&#13;
the collective OPEC surplus for the first time in 1983 by US$7 billion and the&#13;
modest increase of less than US$3 billion in 1984 indicate that the peak had&#13;
been attained in 1982.&#13;
Despite the recent reductions in oil revenues, most OPEC countries&#13;
have not managed to institute corresponding reductions in government&#13;
expenditures.      The  high  absorbers   financed   their  deficits   through&#13;
international borrowing.   Even Iran and Iraq did so after exhausting their&#13;
substantial surpluses--estimated at US$50 billion--partly as a result of their&#13;
continued military conflict. By contrast, the low absorbers for the most part&#13;
did not resort to international borrowing; instead they relied on withdrawals&#13;
from their accumulated surplus.   The countries initially identified as low&#13;
absorbers have increased their absorption over time, so that the term appears&#13;
no longer applicable to their current economic condition.&#13;
The Deployment of Surplus&#13;
Up to the end of 1984 the industrially advanced countries had&#13;
received about 66 percent of the surplus, the largest recipients being the&#13;
United States (18 percent) and the United Kingdom (11 percent). The remaining&#13;
37 percent was distributed among Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France,&#13;
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and&#13;
Switzerland. The developing countries received 27 percent of surplus capital&#13;
flows; 16 percent as net disbursements of concessional assistance and the&#13;
remaining 11 percent in the form of syndicated Eurocurrency credits,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
Eurobonds, and direct investments. International organizations received about&#13;
7 percent of the cumulative surplus.&#13;
Annual total surplus fluctuated over time as a net outcome of oil&#13;
revenue flows, on the one hand, and total expenditures, on the other.&#13;
Following the first major oil price increase, the 1974 surplus alone was more&#13;
than 2Â½ times as much as the cumulative surplus through 1973; this point&#13;
marked  the  first peak.   The  steady surplus  of the next  three years was&#13;
followed by a trough in 1978. The second major oil price increase pushed the&#13;
annual surplus higher; it reached a greater peak in 1980, but then declined&#13;
rapidly thereafter.   The time pattern of annual surplus placements in the&#13;
industrial countries, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom&#13;
began to show substantial withdrawals as early as 1932.&#13;
In contrast, annual surplus placements in the developing countries&#13;
rose steadily until they reached a peak in 1981, then fell thereafter.  Yet,&#13;
they were significantly higher than the placements in the industrial countries&#13;
since 1982 (table 1). Although OPEC countries incurred net drawdowns of funds&#13;
in the industrial countries in 1983 and 1984, they continued to place funds in&#13;
the developing countries.   These changes were most likely the result of the&#13;
variant forms of placements  in the two groups of countries.   The greater&#13;
liquidity of OPEC placements in the industrial countries rendered them the&#13;
more natural means with which to finance the budgetary deficits in the OPEC&#13;
countries that began to increase significantly in 1982.&#13;
The composition of cumulative surplus placements at the end of 1984&#13;
in  some  major  markets  demonstrates  the  point.    In  the  United  States,&#13;
placements were mainly portfolio investments: 52 percent in U.S. Treasury&#13;

securities (bills, certificates, bonds, and notes), 13 percent in commercial&#13;
bank liabilities, 17 percent in corporate bonds and stocks, 11 percent in&#13;
other liabilities, and 7 percent in direct investmenits.  Thus, more than 80&#13;
percent of these assets were in short-term and medium-term obligations that&#13;
involve little or no risk for principal and interest.   Similarly,  in the&#13;
United Kingdom, OPEC's investments at end of 1984 were highly concentrated in&#13;
commercial bank liabilities:   78 percent in foreign currency deposits and&#13;
about 9 percent in sterling deposits.  In other OECI) markets, investments of&#13;
OPEC countries were similarly concentrated in short-term investments; bank&#13;
deposits alone accounted for 56 percent.&#13;
The surplus placements in developing countries were distributed&#13;
differently: 59 percent in net disbursements of concessional assistance, 23&#13;
percent in syndicated Eurocurrency credits, 4 percent in Eurobonds, and 14&#13;
percent in direct investments.&#13;
From the structure of surplus placements through 1984 irrespective of&#13;
national boundaries, it appears that bank deposi:s (estimated at US$164&#13;
billion) represented 35 percent of total identified investments, other short-&#13;
and medium-term liquid or semiliquid investments (about US$208 billion)&#13;
represented 44 percent of the total, concessional assistance to developing&#13;
countries (US$78 billion) represented 16 percent, and direct long-term&#13;
investments (US$24 billion) represented 5 percent. 4/&#13;
The Management of Surplus&#13;
In managing their surplus over time, the OPEC countries were guided&#13;
by two sets of factors: those that all investors take into consideration and&#13;
those that are unique to OPEC countries.   All investors consider return,&#13;
liquidity, and the relative risks involved in the well-known tradeoff between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
short-term  and  long-term  investments.         Short-term  investments  provide&#13;
generally lower returns but more liquid and less risky options than do long-&#13;
term  investments.  The  factors  unique  to OPEC countries  are   security,  a&#13;
realization lag, and a decision lag. Security is probably the most important&#13;
factor determining the management of the surplus, and it explains why OPEC&#13;
countries have concentrated most  of their investments  in the industrially&#13;
advanced countries.   The realization lag pertains to the time that elapses&#13;
before an oil country realizes that it will have a sizable new surplus; during&#13;
this period it usually prefers to place such funds in short-term claims. This&#13;
describes the situation in 1974, shortly after the first major oil price&#13;
increase,  and  late  in  1979,  shortly  after  the  second  major  oil  price&#13;
increase. The decision lag refers to the period necessary to reach decisions&#13;
on long-term investments, during which time available funds are placed in&#13;
short-term instruments.&#13;
The security factor explains the geographic location of funds, while&#13;
the two lag factors explain the marked changes in the maturity structure of&#13;
investments  by OPEC  countries  over time.   Estimates  of the annual  total&#13;
surplus between 1974 and 1984 (table 1) indicate that peaks occurred after the&#13;
two major oil price increases in 1974 and 1980, followed by decline, which was&#13;
especially sharp after the second peak.   Within this total,  the share of&#13;
short-term investments fluctuated, but generally followed the size of the&#13;
incremental surplus itself. 5/&#13;
The pronounced general shift toward longer-term investments was more&#13;
likely the result of the decision lag, which involved learning by doing on the&#13;
part of investment managers in OPEC countries.   This suggestion is supported&#13;
by the rise in the share of longer maturity and direct investments in OECD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
markets despite the falling annual surplus. The associated decision lags were&#13;
long because of the time required to identify projects, assess their financial&#13;
and economic viability, negotiate terms and conditionalities with host&#13;
countries and/or counterparts, and identify or establish institutions that&#13;
could efficiently construct and/or manage projects.   This type of careful&#13;
attention helps generate attractive returns in the long run, whether the&#13;
investment  is carried out in a developed or developing country.   With the&#13;
realization that the days of an increasing surplus are over, the main concern&#13;
of Arab investment managers is now to maintain the wealth accumulated&#13;
overseas.   Conditions permitting, investment managers would prefer to limit&#13;
the use of such assets in financing budgetary deficits at home to the annual&#13;
investment income.   To be sure, most Arab placements will continue to be in&#13;
OECD countries. However, the expanded presence of Arab financial institutions&#13;
and investment banks in developing countries suggests that the future share of&#13;
developing countries in total Arab placements will not decline.  It may even&#13;
increase.&#13;
II. Kuwait: The Earliest Capital Surplus Country&#13;
The international deployment of capital on a large scale was a new&#13;
experience for the oil countries, apart from Kuwait.   Almost overnight they&#13;
were called upon to manage a variety of financial activities--from short-term&#13;
investments, financial intermediation for medium- or long-term loans or bonds,&#13;
official   aid   and  concessional   assistance,   to  direct   and   portfolio&#13;
investments. Only Kuwait was in a somewhat better position to cope with these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
responsibilities since it had already developed some of the mechanisms and&#13;
institutions needed to manage a capital surplus.&#13;
With reference to relations with developing countries in particular,&#13;
the Kuwait experience demonstrates that: (a) growth and prosperity of an oil&#13;
economy often produce substantial benefits to neighboring countries in the&#13;
form of increased trade, private investments, workers remittances, and&#13;
official aid; (b) the substantial expansion of Kuwait's trade was associated&#13;
with equally substantial expansion in imports from developing countries; (c)&#13;
Kuwait's private investments in developing countries depended not only on the&#13;
safety of and returns from investments but also on the social environment and&#13;
personal ties in host countries; (d) expatriate workers were major&#13;
contributors to the financial growth and prosperity of Kuwait in the form of&#13;
consumption expenditures and to their countries of origin in the form of&#13;
remittances; and (e) official aid depended on Kuwait's political relations and&#13;
status with developing countries as well as on the size of the surplus on the&#13;
current account balance.   To handle all such flows, Kuwait developed wide-&#13;
ranging financial institutions over a long period, during which its modus&#13;
operandi was learning by doing.&#13;
Developments Prior to 1974&#13;
Historically Kuwait's relations with developing countries have been&#13;
closely tied to its physical make-up and to the initiatives of its people.&#13;
Because of Kuwait's lack of land resources and geographic location, the sea&#13;
has been the principal source of employment and livelihood for Kuwaitis for&#13;
the last two centuries. Trade, fishing, and pearling were the main economic&#13;
activities during the pre-oil era.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
In the eighteenth century Kuwait emerged as a trading center serving&#13;
neighboring Arab countries, Africa's East Coast, Persia, and the Indian&#13;
Subcontinent.   This  prompted  the British East India Company to move its&#13;
headquarters for the northern Gulf from Basrah to Kuwait. 6/ By the beginning&#13;
of the nineteenth century, Kuwaiti sailors in their dhows (trade boats) were&#13;
becoming prominent in the vast trading area of the Indian Ocean.   Complex&#13;
relations developed between mariner, shipowner, and merchant.   Many notable&#13;
Kuwaiti merchant families owned ships and financed the voyages.   Sometimes&#13;
they found investment opportunities in the source of traded goods; for&#13;
example, some purchased date plantations or provided working capital to&#13;
growers of dates or other food crops.   Furthermore, these merchant families&#13;
provided Kuwait with its social and political Leadership, as well as the&#13;
financial astuteness that is still prevalent today. 7/&#13;
The era of modern banking in Kuwait began with the establishement of&#13;
the British Bank of the Middle East (BBME) in 1942, following the discovery of&#13;
commercial quantities of oil.  As elsewhere in the Gulf, BBME had a banking&#13;
monopoly in Kuwait, which continued until 1952.   In that year, a group of&#13;
businessman established the first Kuwaiti-owned bank, the National bank of&#13;
Kuwait (NBK), following the trippling of the country's share of oil&#13;
revenues. Throughout the 1950s, all banking activities in Kuwait were handled&#13;
only by BBME and NBK.  Whereas average annual import financing was less than&#13;
US$100 million during 1950-55, it more than doubled during 1956-60.&#13;
Substantially increased oil revenues during that period made it possible to&#13;
finance a major program of urban land purchase as a means of distributing&#13;
income to the general population.   With the rapid urban growth, land prices&#13;
increased severalfold and thus significantly expanded the liquidity of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
private sector.   The associated commercial and construction boom led to the&#13;
establishment in 1960 of two additional private commercial banks: the Gulf&#13;
Bank, and the Commercial Bank of Kuwait.&#13;
Kuwait's relations with developing countries during the 1950s largely&#13;
revolved around its neighbors.  Kuwaitis traded heavily with India and Iran,&#13;
attracted skilled labor for their growing economy from Arab countries, and&#13;
invested private funds in Lebanese real estate.   No data are available to&#13;
indicate the size of these early flows.   The country was still a British&#13;
protectorate, and its data base was almost nonexistent.&#13;
Much of the recorded data reflect conditions since the country's&#13;
independence  in  1961.   The annual amount  of import  trade financing,  for&#13;
example, increased significantly between 1961 and 1973--from an annual average&#13;
of about US$300 million in 1961-65 to about US$750 million in 1970-73.&#13;
Cumulatively, the volume of financial flows handled by the Kuwaiti banking&#13;
system in association with the import trade was about US$7 billion, US$1.7&#13;
billion of which was with developing countries.   According to fragmentary&#13;
data, cumulative flows of workers' remittances during the same period amounted&#13;
to about US$1.5 billion. The cumulative value of private sector investments,&#13;
according to even more fragmentary data, was about another US$1.5 billion,&#13;
about half of which was in developing countries, principally in the Arab&#13;
region. 8-&#13;
At the same time that these developments were taking place in the&#13;
private sector the government was seeking both domestic and international&#13;
outlets  owing  to  the  substantial  accumulation   of  public   resources.&#13;
Domestically, the government established its fully owned Credit Bank in 1961&#13;
to provide small loans at subsidized interest rates for the development of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
real  estate  and  for  industrial  and  agricultural  projects.    To  extend&#13;
activities beyond Kuwait, the government also in 1961 established two major&#13;
financial institutions: the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED),&#13;
which was to manage the country's official aid program, and the Kuwait&#13;
Investment Company (KIC), which was to channel public and private funds to&#13;
investment opportunities, especially outside Kuwait:.&#13;
For years the Kuwait Fund was the only Arab aid institution for&#13;
project  assistance.    It  provided,  and  continues  to  provide,  loans  on&#13;
concessional terms for specific projects that have favorable implications for&#13;
the borrowers' economic development and a satisfactory rate of economic&#13;
return.  Up to 1974, the fund's resources were allocated only to Arab League&#13;
members;  thereafter  they were  extended  to all developing  countries.    In&#13;
addition  to  project  assistance  Kuwait's aid  eEfort  included  substantial&#13;
general support assistance to Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, following the 1967&#13;
Khartown conference.   By the end of 1973, Kuwait had contributed a total of&#13;
about US$1,100 million to those "confrontation states". 9/&#13;
Between 1962 and 1973, the Kuwait Fund processed 45 projects to&#13;
twelve Arab countries, for a total commitment of US$370 million, and gross&#13;
disbursements of US$230 million.  l   The sectoraL distribution of loans was&#13;
diversified  but  generally  tilted  toward  infrastructure:    28 percent  for&#13;
agriculture, 18 percent for industry, and 54 percent for infrastructure, the&#13;
lion's share of which was in transport (37 percent). Agricultural loans went&#13;
mostly to Morocco,  Sudan,  and Tunisia.   Industrial loans were distributed&#13;
throughout recipient countries.   Transport loans were similarly distributed&#13;
throughout, but a large share went to Egypt; and electricity loans were&#13;
concentrated in Bahrain and Tunisia.  During this phase (1962-73), Egypt was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
the largest recipient of Kuwait Fund loans (20 percent), followed by Sudan (17&#13;
percent), and Tunisia (14 percent).&#13;
The Kuwait Fund attached special importance to the overall social&#13;
objectives of projects, particularly to improving conditions in rural areas,&#13;
in neglected parts of the economy, or in underprivileged segments of the&#13;
population.   Symptomatic of the fund's dynamism, even in those early years,&#13;
was the rapid expansion of its capital.   From an initial capital of KD 50&#13;
million (US$140 million), the government doubled the fund's capital once in&#13;
1963, and once more in 1966 to KD 200 million (US$560 million).   Later on,&#13;
during the 1970s, the fund continued to expand its capital dramatically, so&#13;
that by 1979 it had reached KD2,000 million (US$6900 million).&#13;
On the international investment front, the early activities of KIC&#13;
(50   percent   government   participation)   were   highly   concentrated   in&#13;
international financial instruments with diversified term structure such as&#13;
bank deposits, securities, papers and notes, and medium-term loans; they&#13;
averaged about 92 percent of the company's assets during 1965-70, none of&#13;
which were in developing countries.   The remaining 8 percent were in direct&#13;
investment activities, which were concentrated in real estate and banking&#13;
throughout the Arab countries, Europe, the United States and Latin America.&#13;
The expressed policy of KIC for that period was to diversify investments to&#13;
assure a reasonable degree of safety, but at the same time maximize income.&#13;
In 1967, the KIC started underwriting and syndicating Eurodollar bonds and&#13;
convertible debentures for prime OECD borrowing agencies. In subsequent years&#13;
these activities expanded to agencies in some of the semi-industrial&#13;
developing countries in Latin America, the Middle East, and the Far East. 1I/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
By contrast, the activities of the Kuwait Foreign Trade, Contracting&#13;
and Investment Company (KFTCIC)--established in 1964, initially with 80&#13;
percent   government   participation--were   more   concentrated   in   direct&#13;
investments. At first the company had planned to invest mainly in developing&#13;
countries.   However, this plan did not materialize because the company found&#13;
it much easier to invest in financial papers and securities from OECD&#13;
countries. During the 1960s it invested more than 85 percent of its resources&#13;
in OECD ventures.   In finance activities, KFTCIC was to extend medium- and&#13;
long-term loans to companies that allowed conversion privileges, options, or&#13;
warrants, and thereby it was eventually to obtain equity positions in&#13;
enterprises without initially foregoing interest income. 121  By 1970 it is&#13;
estimated that the government has invested about US$4 billion abroad while the&#13;
private sector had indeterminate holdings roughly valued at US$1,200&#13;
million. 13/&#13;
Another important development that must be noted was the initiative&#13;
taken in 1964 by the Kuwaiti Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Egypt&#13;
to establish in Cairo one of the forerunners of the inter-Arab banks, the Arab&#13;
African Bank.   Kuwait and Egypt each held 42.4 percent of the shares; Iraq&#13;
subscribed later on 10 percent of the bank's capital, and the remaining 5&#13;
percent was subscribed by the governments of Algeria, Jordan, and Qatar.&#13;
Although the bank was a joint-stock company operating under Egyptian law, it&#13;
was granted special status (similar to offshore facilities in other countries)&#13;
that made it exempt from taxes and exchange-control regulations and from&#13;
banking and credit legislation covering joint-stock companies. In view of the&#13;
fierce economic nationalism in Egypt, not to mention the nationalization of&#13;
banks less than three years earlier, the exceptions extended to the Arab&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
African Bank indicated the esteem that Egyptian policymakers at the time&#13;
accorded inter-Arab financial cooperation.&#13;
The Arab African Bank was given a mandate to undertake all banking&#13;
and commercial operations in Arab and African countries, to participate in&#13;
development projects there, and to establish joint venture banks and&#13;
companies.    By  1970,  the  Bank  had a portfolio  of  14 direct  investment&#13;
projects--six in Africa (37 percent of the value of investments), seven in&#13;
Arab countries (49 percent), and one in Paris (14 percent) in a consortium&#13;
bank to support the development and trading activities of Arab countries. The&#13;
sectoral distribution of projects was balanced among agro-industries,&#13;
transport, tourism, housing, mining, and banking.   During the 1970s, the Bank&#13;
significantly expanded its activities in African and Arab countries and&#13;
substantially increased its capital, thus becoming one of the leading finance&#13;
institutions in the Middle East. 14/&#13;
Another milestone on the road to the internationalization of Kuwaiti&#13;
financial institutions was passed in 1966 when several Kuwaiti commercial&#13;
banks in cooperation with the two investment houses of KIC and KFTCIC&#13;
established the London-based United Bank of Kuwait (UBK).  London was chosen&#13;
because of the special economic and financial relations Kuwait had hitherto&#13;
had with Great Britain. The activities of UBK helped strengthen the position&#13;
of Kuwaiti banks in international operations. Furthermore, the success of UBK&#13;
and the continued accumulation of Kuwaiti private resources induced Kuwaiti&#13;
commercial and investment banks in 1969 to form the first Arab-Occidental&#13;
consortium bank with Societe Generale (Banque Franco-Arabe d'Investissements&#13;
Internationaux, known as FRAB Bank), which was to be based in Paris.   This&#13;
international cooperation brought net gains to the principal participants:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
European banks gained access to petrocapital, while Kuwaiti banks acquired&#13;
modern banking techniques along with international experience and connections&#13;
that helped them develop the capacity to build new financial mechanisms and&#13;
service products.   This new form of banking not on]y enabled both sides to&#13;
reap the benefits of the growing commerce between Europe and Arab countries,&#13;
but it also allowed them to share the costs and risks of the new operations.&#13;
FRAB's activities paved the way for the consortium banks established later,&#13;
such as the Union des Banques Arabes et Francaises (UBAF) in 1970, the&#13;
European Arab Bank (EAB) in 1972, and Banque Arabe et Internationale&#13;
d'Investissements (BAII) in 1973.&#13;
What is significant about these major Arab-Occidental consortium&#13;
banks is that they were all formed before 1974; Kuwait was involved in all of&#13;
them,  sometimes  substantially;  and  they all  had  European  banks  as major&#13;
partners.  On all three points, the question is:  Why?  The fact that these&#13;
consortium banks were formed before 1974 is explained by the marked expansion&#13;
of oil revenues in the early 1970s, which took place even before the first&#13;
major  oil  price  increase.    Kuwait  participated  in  all  because  of  its&#13;
pioneering efforts in international financial ventures--both on the government&#13;
side (as in the case of KIC, KFTCIC, or the Arab African Bank) and or on the&#13;
private business side (as in the cases of UBK and BAII). 151  European banks&#13;
came to be the major overseas partners mainly because of their long-standing&#13;
interest in and familiarity with commerce and finance of Arab economies in&#13;
general and of the then rapidly growing economies of ahe Gulf in particular.&#13;
Developments since 1974&#13;
Like all the oil exporters, Kuwait saw -its oil revenues expand&#13;
remarkably and suddenly following the major increase in oil prices at the end&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19 -&#13;
of 1973.   However, unlike most other oil exporters, Kuwait already had some&#13;
capital markets and financial institutions to cope with the resultant capital&#13;
flows.  The 1970s witnessed major changes in those markets and institutions.&#13;
In addition, Kuwaiti institutions assumed an active role in international&#13;
financial intermediation and management of international portfolio and direct&#13;
investments; they also took a leading role in official aid and concessional&#13;
assistance, and in the cofinancing of development projects.&#13;
With the growth of a large network of commercial banks and money&#13;
exchanges operating domestically and internationally, the short-term capital&#13;
market became more firmly established.   Better job opportunities  and pay&#13;
brought waves of expatriate workers from neighboring developing countries to&#13;
Kuwait. The needs of those expatriates and their newly established purchasing&#13;
power induced a commercial and construction boom, and with it changes in the&#13;
scope and size of local credit and financial institutions. Encouraged by the&#13;
government's policy of no exchange controls, expatriates remitted significant&#13;
amounts of resources to their countries of origin, and local financial&#13;
institutions captured the opportunity for profit by accommodating these&#13;
important  and rapidly growing  capital  flows.   New commercial  banks were&#13;
established, and old banks expanded into new branches.   Increased financial&#13;
flows created pressures to use available investment opportunities, both in&#13;
Kuwait and abroad.   The economy's  capacity to absorb  short-term  funds--&#13;
although it had expanded significantly during the early 1970s in comparison&#13;
with the 1960s--quickly reached its limits in the mid-1970s, and medium-term&#13;
opportunities became more attractive.&#13;
As the market for construction materials, intermediate products,&#13;
food, and consumer goods expanded, a number of import-substitution industries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
began to appear more economically viable.  The Industrial Bank of Kuwait was&#13;
thus established in 1974 to extend medium-term loans to those industries at&#13;
subsidized rates of interest. Because real estate expansion called for more&#13;
than the rollover of short-term credit, the Kuwait Real Estate Investment&#13;
Consortium (KREIC) was established in 1975 to respond to such opportunities.&#13;
Meanwhile, international outlets became increasingly attractive, and before&#13;
long a number of such institutions were establishecd:   Kuwait International&#13;
Investment Company in 1975, the Financial Group of Kuwait in 1976, and the&#13;
Arab European Financial Management Company, also in 1976.   These, together&#13;
with the already established KIC and KFTCIC, helped develop Kuwait's medium-&#13;
term capital market.&#13;
The medium-term capital market expanded rapidly as a result of two&#13;
factors: the growing opportunities for medium-term credit, especially outside&#13;
Kuwait; and the increasing sophistication and experience of some Kuwaiti&#13;
financial   institutions.       Activities   now   included   participation   in&#13;
international loan syndication; lending to multilateral organizations such as&#13;
the World Bank and Asian Development Bank; participation in the IMF oil&#13;
facility; and the establishment of the Arab Company for Trading Securities&#13;
(ACTS), whose main function was to provide a secondary market for financial&#13;
investments. For a while, it appeared that the most significant steps in the&#13;
development of Kuwait's medium-term capital market were the denomination in&#13;
Kuwaiti dinar (KD) of some international bonds and the participation of&#13;
Kuwaiti institutions in managing those bonds.   By the end of 1982, Kuwaiti&#13;
institutions had participated in the management of 104 KD bond issues totaling&#13;
about US$3 billion, equivalent to 40 percent of the total value of bonds&#13;
managed by all Arab institutions. Subsequently, Kuwaiti authorities appeared&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
to have second thoughts about the internationalization of the dinar, and&#13;
argued that the process was nothing more than a borrowers' scheme to obtain&#13;
dollars at lower interest rates.&#13;
Through the expertise and talent assembled in the Kuwait Fund, Kuwait&#13;
took a leading role in establishing and managing a number of multilateral&#13;
development organizations:  the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development&#13;
in 1968;   the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) and the&#13;
Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation, both in 1974; the OPEC Fund in&#13;
1976; and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in&#13;
1977. 16/&#13;
(These and other contributions of the Kuwait Fund are discussed in section IV.)&#13;
The Financial Flows (1961-84)&#13;
The volume of financial inflows and outflows managed by Kuwaiti&#13;
institutions is not reliably known; it is estimated here from various&#13;
sources.   The reporting covers the period since Kuwait's independence, that&#13;
is, during 1961-84 (see table 2). Even though the discussion emphasizes 1974&#13;
as a significant point in the development of Kuwaiti financial institutions,&#13;
the pattern of estimated financial flows actually falls into three distinct&#13;
periods, in line with oil price movements: 1961-73, preceding the first major&#13;
oil price increase; 1974-78, following the first major oil price increase; and&#13;
1979-84, following the second major oil price increase.&#13;
The quality of the data in table 2 is manifestly uneven, as the&#13;
sources ranged from Kuwaiti government statistics in the cases of export&#13;
revenues, imports and official aid, to balance of payments estimates modified&#13;
by independent findings in the case of workers remittances, to fragmented and&#13;
&#13;

occasionally conflicting sources in the case of private investments.&#13;
Nonetheless, a number of observations can be made: (a) total export revenues&#13;
during the 1961-84 period was about US$159 billion, 56 percent of which&#13;
occurred after the second major oil price increase; (b) the total&#13;
international financial outflows handled by Kuwaiti institutions during the&#13;
1961-84 period was about US$95 billion, 60 percent o:E which occured after the&#13;
second major oil price increase; (c) the largest cat:egory by far in Kuwait's&#13;
financial outflows was import financing, which accounted for 69 percent of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
flows; (d) although investment data are not as specific as would be&#13;
desirable,it appears that the share of developing countries in private&#13;
investments was about one-half; (e) accordingly, the share of developing&#13;
countries in total Kuwaiti financial outflows was about US$40 billion, or 42&#13;
percent of the total; and (f) the composition of total outflows to developing&#13;
countries revealed that trade was more important than aid, and that workers&#13;
remittances were more significant than private investments.&#13;
Such flows together with the range of financial institutions&#13;
established as a result of financial growth have rendered Kuwait a major&#13;
financial center in the Arab region, especially in the Gulf. This center did&#13;
not develop overnight. It took nearly three decades of trial and error on the&#13;
domestic front and patient and prudent management of private and government&#13;
capital on the international front. Since the early 1980s, however, Kuwait's&#13;
standing as a financial center has been affected in varying degrees by several&#13;
crises: the Iran-Iraq war has practically wiped out Kuwait's once-thriving&#13;
re-export trade; the continued financial support for Iraq in its war with Iran&#13;
has placed increasing burdens on Kuwaiti resources; the collapse of the&#13;
parallel stock exchange (Suq al Manakh) has shaken the confidence of the small&#13;
tightly knit financial community; the serious decline in oil revenues has&#13;
added to the financial strains; the end of the once seemingly endless real&#13;
estate boom has put many institutions and individuals in a tight liquidity&#13;
squeeze; and the 1984 banking crisis associated with a 15 percent fall in the&#13;
collective profits of commercial banks has interrupted the momentum of the&#13;
country's leading banking and finance sector.&#13;
Despite the damaging effects of these crises, there is no denying&#13;
that Kuwait continues to possess a wide range of financial and investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
institutions that have become especially attuned to the international and&#13;
regional economic realities of the 1980s and to the present and future&#13;
challenges of the financial markets.   Without deliberately  setting out to&#13;
become a model for other capital surplus countries in the Gulf, Kuwait seems&#13;
to have taken on this role. It is a model that offers a number of important&#13;
lessons.&#13;
III. The International Orientation of Arab Financial Institutions&#13;
To reiterate, the internationalization of Kuwait's financial system&#13;
did not occur in vacuum, but was a part of an evolving process.   Kuwait's&#13;
story is one of a domestic financial system that could not fully absorb the&#13;
liquidity associated with major oil revenue inflows. About two decades later,&#13;
the same situation developed in some of the other oil-exporting countries,&#13;
though in varying degrees.   Their experience provides the basis for this&#13;
discussion of the activities of Arab financial institutions in developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
This  section  looks  at  several  aspects  of  the  international&#13;
orientation of Arab financial institutions: (a) the role of external financial&#13;
and banking interests in the development of short-term capital markets in the&#13;
low absorbers; (b) the institutional mechanisms that helped the low absorbers&#13;
enter the financial markets in general and the developing countries in&#13;
particular; (c) the activities of Arab banks in those markets; (d) the&#13;
emergence of centers of Arab banking and finance inside and outside the Arab&#13;
region; and (e) the role of Islamic banks in finance, investment, and the&#13;
development of some developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
The Modest Beginning&#13;
Commercial banking developed much earlier among the high absorbers&#13;
(Algeria and Iraq) than among the low absorbers  (the Gulf states).   Long&#13;
before national interests had reached the point of establishing fully owned&#13;
modern Arab banks in the oil countries, commercial banking in those countries&#13;
was established and operated by foreign interests: the French in Algeria, the&#13;
Italians in Libya, the Dutch in Saudi Arabia, and the British in the rest.&#13;
The French established Banque d'Algerie in 1851.   The Italians established&#13;
Banco di Roma in Libya in 1910.  The Dutch established Nederlandsche Handel&#13;
Maatschappij as the first commercial bank in Saudi Arabia in 1926.  And the&#13;
British established the Eastern Bank in Bahrain in 1920, long before the&#13;
British Bank of the Middle East became dominant in many Gulf protectorates&#13;
during their pre-independence years.&#13;
By and large, these banks served the foreign commercial and business&#13;
interests, whether of those residing in the oil countries or elsewhere.&#13;
Foreign banks derived their main business from financing external trade.  In&#13;
the Gulf states, however, foreign banks were set up in anticipation of a major&#13;
expansion in local business following the successful exploration for oil.&#13;
At the same time, the indigenous communities had their own long&#13;
traditions and practices in trading, business, and money exchange and thus had&#13;
little or no need for modern commercial  banking.   For example,  prominent&#13;
merchants collected deposits from acquaintances, financed import trade&#13;
transactions themselves, and in some cases acted as lenders to the ruling&#13;
families.  171   Financial  dualism was  thus  embedded  in the  socioeconomic&#13;
structure of the oil countries, whose ancient institutions coexisted with&#13;
modern institutions, each serving the distinct financial and commercial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
interests and needs of vastly different communities.   From such a modest&#13;
beginning, some of the local banks managed to establish international presence&#13;
and stature.&#13;
In most oil countries, social modernization was closely related to&#13;
the discovery of oil in commercial quantities.   The oil revenues that the&#13;
governments received, though initially small, began to finance the most&#13;
essential parts of the infrastructure. These rather limited, but continuing,&#13;
flows of government expenditures had an unmistakable multiplier effect on the&#13;
domestic economy through contracts with local merchants for goods and&#13;
services, employment of nationals, the purchasing or leasing of land, renting&#13;
of office  space, and so on.   Especially noticeable was the boom in land&#13;
values, which contributed to local prosperity, as it had twenty years earlier&#13;
in Kuwait.  As incomes in the private sector increased, so did expenditures,&#13;
especially on imported consumer goods and durables.   The resident foreign&#13;
communities profited in two related ways:   through increased import trade in&#13;
which they actively participated and at times dominated, and through&#13;
commercial banks that they owned or controlled to finance imports or domestic&#13;
trading.   As oil revenues expanded further over time, the consumption and&#13;
investment expenditures by government and private entities also expanded. The&#13;
corresponding  monetary  flows  increased,  as  did  the  need  to  expand  the&#13;
institutions managing those flows.&#13;
With the establishment of modern banks in the oil countries,  the&#13;
financial dualism there began to disappear.  Among the first to initiate the&#13;
trend was Saudi Arabia's family-owned National Commercial Bank, which began&#13;
its operations in Jeddah in 1938.  Next came Iraq's government-owned Rafidain&#13;
Bank in Baghdad in 1941; Tripoli's National Bank of Libya in 1955; the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
National Bank of Bahrain in 1957; the National Bank of Dubai in 1963; the&#13;
government-owned National Bank of Abu Dhabi in 1968; and Muscat's National&#13;
Bank of Oman in 1973.&#13;
However, foreign banking activities in the oil countries did not&#13;
cease  at  that  point.    In  several  cases,  the  rise  of modern  Arab banks&#13;
coincided  with  the  growth  and  expansion  of  foreign  banks.    Both  groups&#13;
followed the commercial banking practices of the metropolitan countries; in&#13;
particular, they concentrated on short-term commercial loans, related for the&#13;
most  part  to external  and  internal  trading.   In some countries  (such as&#13;
Bahrain, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and Oman), Arab and foreign banks (fully&#13;
owned, or branch offices) have continued to coexist right up to the present.&#13;
In other countries, commercial banks were nationalized following Cairo's&#13;
example in 1961: Iraq nationalized its entire banking system in 1964, Algeria&#13;
in 1965, Libya in 1970, and Kuwait in 1971.&#13;
Saudi Arabia followed a middle course, and allowed both national and&#13;
fully owned foreign commercial banks to expand until 1974, when they had 12&#13;
banks with 72 branches. i8/  Significantly, 10 of the 12 banks operating in&#13;
the country at that time were foreign owned and operated. 19/  However,  in&#13;
1975 the Saudi government launched a "Saudization" campaign, completed in&#13;
1981, under which all non-Saudi banks had to accept 60 percent Saudi&#13;
ownership.&#13;
As already noted in section I, even before the first major oil price&#13;
increase, financial flows into the low absorbers increased significantly&#13;
following the moves in oil prices in 1971 and 1972, which expanded the&#13;
activities of Arab and foreign banks.   Up to that point, existing financial&#13;
institutions had been able to handle the resultant financial flows. However,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
the economies of the low absorbers as a whole were not prepared to handle the&#13;
enormous expansion in oil revenues that followed soon thereafter.&#13;
The Years of Affluence&#13;
The new reality of surplus capital created the need for more complex&#13;
financial systems and more sophisticated banking institutions.   The existing&#13;
local systems quickly became overloaded and soon both local and international&#13;
financial  markets  were  responding  to the surplus capital.   In the local&#13;
markets, entrepreneurs pushed local activities in trade and construction to&#13;
record levels.   In a short period, large flows of workers came into the oil&#13;
countries from neighboring and distant countries seeking better work&#13;
opportunities and higher pay.   For a few years, expatriate workers' demands&#13;
for goods, services, and housing appeared to continue practically unchecked.&#13;
The substantial profits that local businessmen, made in a short period&#13;
encouraged them to become more aggressive in trading and investing.   They&#13;
moved from the traditional ways of financing activities with their own capital&#13;
to borrowing, sometimes heavily, from the local banks, which were awash in&#13;
liquidity.   For a while,  the supply of funds  in most Arab oil-exporting&#13;
countries appeared to be virtually unlimited and the question was to what&#13;
extent  could  local  entrepreneurs  absorb  borrowed  funds.    Under  these&#13;
conditions, the cost of capital was low and conditions of lending were quite&#13;
relaxed.  Loans were made not on the basis of feasibility studies or balance&#13;
sheets, but on the strength of the individual applicant's family connections&#13;
and personal reputation.   The short-term capital market was thus pushed into&#13;
an environment of unbounded optimism.&#13;
On the international front, a large part of the funds generated was&#13;
quickly channeled into larger and more diverse marlkets; this move signaled the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
birth of the so-called recycling problem in international financial markets.&#13;
The Euromarket, which was emerging in the early 1970s, was given a major boost&#13;
from the capital surplus flowing through Arab and non-Arab institutions. The&#13;
Euromarket which was relatively free of supervision, inspired innovation and&#13;
aggressive banking that not only attracted Arab capital, but eventually&#13;
attracted Arab institutions themselves to become participants. 20/&#13;
The hitherto Kuwait-dominated consortium banks attracted other Arab&#13;
financial institutions after 1974, thereby changing the structure of their&#13;
ownership  and  management.    As  the  size  and  country composition  of Arab&#13;
financial flows changed, the functions of the consortium banks evolved beyond&#13;
their initial objectives, as will be shown below.&#13;
The consortium bank formula appealed to Arab financial institutions&#13;
just as it had appealed to Kuwaiti institutions earlier.  Few Arab banks had&#13;
been exposed to international banking techniques and international financial&#13;
and investment know-how, and their connections in international banking and&#13;
business circles were rather limited. To break into these new domains the new&#13;
Arab banks had to take risks that they were not willing to take on their own,&#13;
especially when the stakes were quite high with the markedly increasing&#13;
petrocapital flows. The idea of sharing costs and risks with leading European&#13;
banks, just as Kuwaiti banks had done before, appeared a particularly&#13;
attractive solution.   Some Arab banks, in fact, joined in existing Kuwaiti-&#13;
European consortium banks. Others preferred to establish new Arab-Occidental&#13;
consortium  banks.    The  consortium  banking  formula  was  a  marriage  of&#13;
convenience that brought benefits to both the European and Arab banks.&#13;
Although FRAB was initially started by Kuwaiti banks and Societe&#13;
General, it evolved quickly and soon included other Arab banks from Saudi&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Arabia, UAE, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco and OECD banks from Belgium,&#13;
Holland,  Switzerland,  Spain, Greece,  and Japan.   Similarly,  UBAF became a&#13;
consortium of many Arab and OECD institutions.   On UBAF's Arab side alone,&#13;
there were eleven commercial banks, five central banks, nine government banks,&#13;
and a ministry of finance. The pattern was about the same in BAII and EAB.&#13;
Although most consortium banks were initially set up to promote Arab-&#13;
Occidental business relations, their mandate expanded quickly to cover a wide&#13;
range of activities, including commercial banking, trade fin*ncing, fo*eign&#13;
exchange, money market, and loan syndication.   Some, however,  still added&#13;
special features to their services.   In order to attract the rich individual&#13;
Arab  investors,    BAII,  for  example,  initiated,  real  estate  management,&#13;
insurance, and stock market programs.   Thus, BAII was acting as a financial&#13;
advisor to Arab investors.   In addition, the bank became quite active in the&#13;
Eurobond market, managing large issues in both OECD and Arab currencies&#13;
(including UAE dirham, Kuwaiti dinar, and Bahraini dinar).&#13;
The participation of an increasing number of non-Kuwaiti Arab banks&#13;
in existing consortium banks accelerated their growth momentum and enabled&#13;
them to enter into joint ventures with leading banks in the major financial&#13;
centers of London, New York, Rome, Luxembourg, Frankfurt, and Hong Kong.  In&#13;
addition, consortium banks established Asian branches and/or joint ventures in&#13;
Seoul, Tokyo, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Singapore to&#13;
facilitate trade and investment transactions with that vital part of the&#13;
world. 21/  The waves of business and financial opportunities involving the&#13;
newly created oil-related wealth led to the establishment of specialized&#13;
international banks to promote bilateral cooperation between Mediterranean&#13;
countries and Arab countries.   Thus, the Banco Arab-Espanol (Aresbank) was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
established in Madrid in 1975 with a capital of US$19 million; the Banco&#13;
Saudi-Espanol (Saudesbank) was established also in Madrid in 1979 with a&#13;
capital of US$53 million; the Arab-Hellenic Bank was established in Athens in&#13;
1979 with a capital of US$15 million; and the Arab-Turkish Bank was&#13;
established in Istanbul in 1977 with a capital of US$20 million. Some of the&#13;
activities of these bilateral banks were short-term oriented; others were&#13;
investment oriented, and financed projects in host countries.  An example of&#13;
short-term activities, was the Arab-Turkish Bank's active involvement in&#13;
financing the rapidly growing Arab-Turkish trade, repatriating the increased&#13;
flows of Turkish workers remittances especially from Saudi Arabia, and issuing&#13;
of international guarantees for Turkish contractors working in Arab countries,&#13;
notably Libya and Saudi Arabia.&#13;
Arab banks were present not only in international financial centers&#13;
and  Mediterranean  capitals,  but  also  in  Latin  America.    The  Arab-Latin&#13;
American Bank (Arlabank) was set up in Lima in 1977 as a consortium bank to&#13;
promote financial cooperation and industrial and commercial relations between&#13;
Arab and Latin American countries.   The activities of the Arlabank include&#13;
trade financing between the two regions; merchant and commercial banking; and&#13;
joint ventures in mining, agriculture, and petrochemicals.   It appears that,&#13;
by the late 1970s, Arab financial institutions had responded to the new&#13;
international business challenges by establishing a global network.&#13;
Centers of Arab Banking&#13;
The rapid growth of Arab banking was associated with the development&#13;
of major clusterings of Arab banks in several cities/states.   In the Arab&#13;
region, Kuwait, Bahrain, and, to a lesser extent, Cairo emerged as such&#13;
centers.    Other  clusters  grew  up  in  London,  Paris,  New  York,  Geneva,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Frankfurt,  Singapore,  and Hong Kong.   Arab regional centers  shifted over&#13;
time.   Up to the late 1960s, Beirut was the zacknowledged center of Arab&#13;
banking and finance.   Although the focal point of Arab banking shifted from&#13;
Lebanon to the Gulf in the early 1970s, no Arab city could entirely replace&#13;
Beirut in its diverse financial functions. 221  Within the Gulf, a degree of&#13;
specialization was evident by the late 1970s, with Kuwait emerging as an&#13;
investment center and Bahrain as a money market center.  For a while, Dubai&#13;
appeared on its way to becoming a merchant bankinag center, but this has not&#13;
transpired.    As  Kuwait was  already covered  in section  II,  this  section&#13;
presents some detail on Bahrain.&#13;
Bahrain became an Arab center of finance through a combination of&#13;
factors:   the government's need to diversify the domestic economic base, the&#13;
adoption of flexible policies to achieve the diversification strategy, the&#13;
country's special locational advantages, the traditional orientation of&#13;
Bahrainis to private enterprise, and the absence of chauvinistic pressures.&#13;
Equally important was the 'community orientation' of other Gulf countries&#13;
towards Bahrain; e.g. the early inter-Gulf countries financial institutions&#13;
were established in Bahrain (Bank of Bahrain and Kuwait, and the Gulf Bank).&#13;
In the early 1970s, Bahrain's oil exports began to decline because of&#13;
dwindling oil resources.  The government subsequently adopted a three-pronged&#13;
diversification strategy to prepare Bahrain for the postoil era: It promoted&#13;
energy-intensive industries (aluminum), servicing of oil tanker traffic in the&#13;
Gulf  (drydock),  and  financial  services.   Both the drydock and  financial&#13;
services derive from Bahrain's advantageous location close to the shores of&#13;
Saudi Arabia in the middle of the Gulf.  The island thus provides oil tankers&#13;
with a desirable repairs and maintenance stop. Moreover, Bahrain's time zone&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
allows it to deal with financial centers running from London to New York, San&#13;
Francisco, Tokyo, and Singapore since it can conduct foreign exchange business&#13;
after Singapore closes, but before the European centers open.  In addition,&#13;
Bahrain's long association with international commerce has helped it to excel&#13;
in finance. Individually, Bahrainis prefer business activities to government&#13;
employment.   Collectively,  they welcome and work quite well with foreign&#13;
businessmen, regardless of their national origins. No national sensitivities&#13;
are stirred in Bahrain with presence or growth of multinational enterprises,&#13;
and the relationships with other Arab states in the Gulf have been excellent.&#13;
Foreign banks unable to establish themselves in Kuwait or Saudi&#13;
Arabia  because   of  legal   barriers   have  found  Bahrain  a  convenient&#13;
alternative.   With the  1975 legislation of offshore  banking units  (OBUs)&#13;
modeled along the lines of operations in Singapore and in the Cayman Islands,&#13;
Bahrain  became  a  highly  attractive  banking  center.    Most  major  banks&#13;
established branch offices, and by 1983 there were 21 commercial banks, 63&#13;
representative offices (35 in 1980), 16 investment companies, 6 foreign&#13;
exchange brokers, 77 OBUs (51 in 1980), and another 2 OBUs licensed to start.&#13;
23/   The rapid expansion of foreign banking is particularly evident in the&#13;
numbers of representative offices and OBUs.   In fact, "the list of Bahrain&#13;
banks reads almost like a roll call of the world's most famous institutions."&#13;
24/   In institutional range, Bahrain has begun to rival such international&#13;
banking centers as Singapore, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, and Nassau, and its&#13;
banking community is growing more and more diverse.&#13;
The direction of capital flows into and out of Bahrain is&#13;
noteworthy.   For the most part, capital flows into Bahrain originate in the&#13;
Arab countries and Western Europe. The share of Arab countries as sources of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
funds steadily expanded from 50 percent in 1978 to 66 percent in 1983; that of&#13;
Western Europe steadily declined from 30 percent in 1978 to 21 percent in&#13;
1983; and that of other sources combined (such as the United States or Asia)&#13;
also declined, from 20 percent in 1978 to 14 percent in 1983.  Capital from&#13;
Bahrain flows to borrowers practically everywhere. IIowever, Bahrain is a net&#13;
exporter of funds to the Far East (Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo), Asia, Latin&#13;
America, and lately Western Europe. 25/ The fact that 66 percent of the funds&#13;
originate in Arab countries while about 50 percent is lent to Arab clients has&#13;
led observers to conclude that Bahrain was a center for recycling oil revenues&#13;
to the outside world.&#13;
Assets of OBUs increased rapidly over a short time span, from US$23.4&#13;
billion  in  1978  to US$62.7  billion  at  the  end of  1983.   Significantly,&#13;
however,  the pace of growth was not uniform throughout  this  period.   It&#13;
accelerated initially, reached a peak of some 35 percent during 1981, then&#13;
decelerated to a mere 6 percent during 1983. Although the picture for 1984 is&#13;
still incomplete, the volume of OBU assets appears to be declining for the&#13;
first time. 26/ This reversal of the growth momentum is the result of several&#13;
factors:   the serious decline in oil revenues flowing to the oil-exporting&#13;
states, the related decline in the volume of shipping maintenance/repairs in&#13;
the dry dock, the continued war between neighboring Iraq and Iran, the&#13;
accumulation of bad debts, and the related regional banking crisis in recent&#13;
years.   Overt signs of trouble for OBUs began to appear in 1984 with the&#13;
departure of some banks, such as Security Pacific, and early in 1985 with the&#13;
distress sale of the Arab Asian Bank to a minority shareholder and the major&#13;
reorganization of the United Gulf Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
Before the crisis finally settles, Bahrain's financial environment&#13;
seems headed for more shakeouts.   Furthermore, the major reforms in banking&#13;
policies instituted in neighboring Saudi Arabia and Kuwait may seriously&#13;
diminish the short-term excess liquidity that OBUs can absorb from these&#13;
countries. Thus, for the forseeable future the Bahraini economy is likely to&#13;
be vulnerable to external shocks. Nevertheless, Bahrain continues to be both&#13;
a regional center for Arab banks and a link in their international&#13;
activities.  At the same time, policymakers are concerned about the depth of&#13;
the ongoing crisis.&#13;
Elsewhere in the Arab region, Cairo has been making an effort to&#13;
become a center of Arab banking (though not without difficulty). By 1983, it&#13;
was the host to about 30 Arab banks, of which 14 were commercial banks, 9&#13;
investment banks,  and 7 representative offices.   Egypt's special relations&#13;
with sister Arab states, its large labor exports to the oil countries and the&#13;
resultant substantial remittances, its Infitah policy (open door) and the&#13;
associated banking reforms, its large and growing absorptive capacity, its&#13;
good location and relative political stability have all induced Arab banks to&#13;
establish a presence in Cairo.&#13;
The difficulties Cairo has faced in becoming an Arab banking center&#13;
stem in part from the vagaries of Middle East politics, examples of which are&#13;
the Arab boycott of Egypt following the Camp David accords with Israel and&#13;
Sadat's  assasination.    Even  greater  constraints  have  been  imposed  by&#13;
nonpolitical factors, most notably the Egyptian bureaucracy. For this reason,&#13;
Cairo's position in Arab banking circles will depend crucially on government&#13;
initiative to minimize restrictions on currency transfers, establish&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
consistent macro management, and do away with the confused multiple exchange&#13;
system.&#13;
By and large, the first modern banking institutions in Arab countries&#13;
have been branches of either British or French banks, the reason being that&#13;
some Arab territories were colonies of Britain or France during the last two&#13;
centuries.   This long association affected the direction in which Arab banks&#13;
expanded during the early 1970s.  That is to say, London and Paris naturally&#13;
became the first international centers to host Arab financial institutions,&#13;
and they still remain the two largest international centers of Arab banking.&#13;
It is difficult to determine exactly how many "Arab" banks are located in&#13;
London, but a 1983 list shows 60 banks, 3 of which were established before&#13;
1970, 12 during 1970-75, 22 during 1976-80, 16 after 1980, and the remaining 7&#13;
at an unknown time. 271  Paris, the second largest center of Arab financial&#13;
institutions abroad, hosts about 39 Arab banks, 3 of which were established&#13;
before 1970, 7 during 1970-75, 26 during 1976-80, and 3 after 1980. 28/  It&#13;
should be noted, however, that lately Arab banks in Paris have become&#13;
uncertain about their future in face of France's recent program of bank&#13;
nationalizations, which have included French share-holdings in Arab consortia.&#13;
In the early 1980s, several other centers emerged as international&#13;
bases of Arab financial institutions, fundamentally because of their position&#13;
in the expanding trade, finance, and investment relations with the oil-&#13;
exporting  countries.   Of  these,  New York  is  the world center of dollar&#13;
transactions and the base of most U.S. giant banks with which Arab governments&#13;
and individuals have deposited large sums; it hosts 19 Arab banks, only 3 of&#13;
which were established before 1980. The United States is the largest trading&#13;
partner of many oil exporters in the Arab region, and the need for trade&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
financing will not diminish. To the private Arab investors, the United States&#13;
provides a safe base and the most numerous and diversified investment&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
Singapore and Hong Kong are key centers of commerce, finance, and&#13;
investments in the Far East; Singapore hosts 19 Arab banks, while Hong Kong&#13;
hosts 15.   With the announcement that Hong Kong will be returned to China,&#13;
this center may have lost some of its attractiveness to Arab banks.&#13;
Switzerland is another traditional banking center with which the Arabs have&#13;
had a long association;  it hosts 15 Arab banks.   Other centers are mostly&#13;
Mediterranean bases with which the Arab countries share their culture,&#13;
history, and commerce; these include Cyprus, Rome, Athens, and Madrid. By the&#13;
early 1980s, the international network of Arab banks had reached into both the&#13;
major and minor finance centers of the world.&#13;
Islamic Banks&#13;
Any discussion of the international orientation of Arab banks would&#13;
be remiss if it failed to mention Islamic banks.   Major capital inflows to&#13;
OPEC countries, many of which are Moslem countries, created challenges to&#13;
establish Islamic financial institutions, first within their own borders then&#13;
internationally.   This is said to be part of a broader revival of Islam and&#13;
its values.  To the world's Moslems, an Islamic economic order represents an&#13;
alternative to capitalist and socialist systems.   The principles of Islamic&#13;
economics derive from Shari'a, the legal system based on the Quran (the Holy&#13;
Book of Islam) and Sunna (the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad). Instead of&#13;
a lender-borrower relationship, Islamic finance relies on the notion of&#13;
distributive justice, that of equitable risk sharing by the sources of capital&#13;
(banks) and the users of capital (entrepreneurs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
The first Islamic bank was privately established in Egypt in 1962,&#13;
but it was not until 1975 that the concept of Islamic financial institutions&#13;
received a major boost with the establishment of the Islamic Development Bank,&#13;
which was capitalized at 2 billion SDRs and whose membership consisted of more&#13;
than 40 Moslem country governments. About two-thirds of its capital came from&#13;
four Arab oil countries:  Saudi Arabia (25 percent), Libya (16 percent), the&#13;
UAE (14 percent), and Kuwait (13 percent).  The Islamic Development Bank is&#13;
commissioned to foster economic development and social progress in the member&#13;
countries according to Islamic law.  To provide technical advice and promote&#13;
cooperation among Islamic banks, it helped establish the International&#13;
Association of Islamic Banks (IAIB) in 1978.  The rapid expansion of Islamic&#13;
banks after the late 1970s created substantial demands for staff training,&#13;
which  could  not  be  adequately  met  by  IAIB.    Another  agency  was  thus&#13;
established for the specific purpose of training the staff of Islamic banks.&#13;
This agency was the International Institute of Islamic Banking and Economics,&#13;
established in 1982 in Lefkosa, Cyprus. 29/&#13;
Most Islamic banks were established in the late 1970s and early&#13;
1980s.   At present,  some thirty Islamic financial institutions operate in&#13;
Arab, Moslem, and other countries.  Among the Arab countries they operate in&#13;
Egypt, Sudan, Jordan, and the Gulf, and of the other Moslem countries,&#13;
Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, and Malaysia have Islamic banks. They can also be&#13;
found in non-Moslem countries (e.g., the Philippines, South Africa, Nassau,&#13;
Luxembourg, Cyprus, and Australia); and some are present in financial centers&#13;
such as London and Geneva.   For the most part,  Islamic banks depend on&#13;
private, not governmental, initiative. The most notable exception is Kuwait&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Finance House, established in 1978 with a 49 percent government shareholding,&#13;
which was increased to 60 percent in 1984. 30/&#13;
The distinction between commercial and investment banks is not quite&#13;
applicable to Islamic banks, because their operations are of a different type,&#13;
the most common being Morabaha, Mosharaka, Modaraba, and to a lesser extent,&#13;
Ijara and Ijara wa Iqtina.  Morabaha refers to the resale of goods with the&#13;
addition of a fixed surcharge on the original cost, on a deferred payment&#13;
basis. Under the Mosharaka principle, an Islamic bank and a client establish&#13;
a partnership, sharing profits and losses until the time, normally fixed, when&#13;
the client will buy out the bank's holding. The Modaraba contract is a silent&#13;
partnership that clearly distinguishes between the capital source (bank) and&#13;
the entrepreneur (modareb) who manages the project. Remuneration is based on&#13;
a predetermined percentage of profits, whereas losses are to be borne by&#13;
capital providers alone; the modareb foregoes remuneration for his work.&#13;
Ijara is rental financing where the bank acquires equipment or buildings and&#13;
makes them available on a straightforward rental basis.  The Ijara wa Iqtina&#13;
is hire-purchase financing which works in a similar way to Ijara, except that&#13;
the client may acquire the rented assets by paying installments into a savings&#13;
account. 31/&#13;
The assets of some of the leading Islamic banks have grown rapidly,&#13;
averaging about 38 percent per year in 1982 and 1983 (see Table 3). However,&#13;
the size of these banks measured in absolute and relative terms is still quite&#13;
small.   The collective assets of the sample of banks shown in table 3 was&#13;
US$1.5 billion in 1981, US$3.9 billion in 1982, and US$5.3 billion in 1983.&#13;
Significantly, the Kuwait Finance House alone accounted for about half of the&#13;
assets of this group. The assets of the group are dwarfed by those of the&#13;

In view of their relative size, Islamic banks thus far have not&#13;
offered an alternative banking formula.   However, such an assessment is not&#13;
fair because Islamic banks have been in existence for no more than a decade&#13;
whereas conventional banks as we know them today have evolved over a period of&#13;
more than two centuries.   What is clear, however, is that the institutional&#13;
framework of Islamic banks is in place and that their connections with centers&#13;
of international finance and Moslem countries are already firmly established.&#13;
Furthermore, it appears that Islamic banks can carve out a specialized role&#13;
for themselves  in servicing Moslem communities throughout  the world.   In&#13;
particular, Islamic banks are ideally suited to mobilizing resources from the&#13;
world's large Moslem communities, which in principle refuse the notion of&#13;
'Riba' (interest charging and receiving).   In the Islamic view this is the&#13;
principal tenet of modern banking.  In Saudi Arabia alone, Islamic banks have&#13;
considerable potential among households that do not have bank accounts,&#13;
estimated to be 35-60 percent of total Saudi households.  How Islamic banks&#13;
will perform this specific task remains to be seen.&#13;
The increased popularity of Islamic banks could not have been due to&#13;
especially favorable returns on deposits and equity or to unusually high&#13;
dividends on paid-up capital, by comparison with commercial banks. During the&#13;
period 1980-82 returns on deposits and equity in Islamic banks have been in&#13;
the range of 2-16 percent while those of the nine commercial banks in Saudi&#13;
Arabia  have  been  in  the  range  of  27-47  percent.    Neither  was  there a&#13;
correlation between returns on deposits/equity and growth of assets, i.e. the&#13;
fastest growing Islamic banks were not necessarily the best performers.  The&#13;
only logical explanation of growth of Islamic banks is their special appeal to&#13;
devout  Moslems  whose  numbers  are  increasing  worldwide.  32/           Growth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
differentials in the size of Islamic banks may partly be explained by&#13;
differences in the connections of bank chiefs with sources of funds.&#13;
Since 1983, both Arab and Islamic banks have experienced setbacks&#13;
owing to a number of factors, any one of which they would have been able to&#13;
weather under normal business conditions in the Gulf.  It is the combination&#13;
of all these factors--the decline in oil revenues, the end of the real estate&#13;
boom, the fall in precious metal prices, the post-Manakh crisis, and the Iran-&#13;
Iraq war--that has reversed the fortunes of many banks, including Islamic&#13;
banks, and caught them in a difficult liquidity sctueeze. 33/&#13;
Size of Arab Banks&#13;
As the preceding sections have shown, Arab banks have recorded rapid&#13;
growth in recent years.   The list of the largest 500 banks compiled by The&#13;
Banker (in terms of assets) contained only seventeen Arab banks in 1980.  In&#13;
1983 the same list had nearly double that number, thirty-two Arab banks. Even&#13;
though oil revenues declined significantly duri.ng that three-year period,&#13;
assets of Arab banks expanded faster than averag,s, so that more banks joined&#13;
the largest 500 list, replacing others in the process.   In terms of assets,&#13;
however, Arab banks continue to be small in comparison with the industry&#13;
leaders.   In 1983,  the assets of the largest Arab bank, Rafidain Bank of&#13;
Baghdad, were US$22.4 billion, which amounted to only 18 percent of the assets&#13;
of Citicorp, the world's largest banking corporation.   Nevertheless, the gap&#13;
between Arab banks and the industry leaders has been narrowing.   In 1980&#13;
Citicorp's assets were greater than the combined assets of all 17 Arab banks&#13;
on the list, but by 1983 they were 76 percent of the combined assets of the&#13;
largest 17 Arab banks, and 57 percent of the combined assets of all 32 Arab&#13;
banks appearing on the list.&#13;

The largest Arab banks were set up before 1973; 25 of the 32&#13;
appearing on the Top 500 list fall in this category.  Of the remaining 7, 5&#13;
were established during 1973-79 (Gulf International Bank, Saudi International&#13;
Bank, Compagnie Arabe et Internationale d'Investissement, Al Bank Al Suadi Al&#13;
Faransi, and Burgan Bank of Kuwait) and 2 in 1980 (Arab Banking Corp. and&#13;
Saudi American Bank) (see table 4).   All seven hiave been among the fastest&#13;
growing banks. All moved upward on The Banker list between 1980 and 1983.&#13;
Significantly, some of the largest Arab banks are based in the&#13;
nonoil countries.   Appearing on the Top 500 lisl: are five banks from Egypt&#13;
(combined assets US$25.8 billion), one from Jordan (US$10.4 billion assets),&#13;
and one from Syria (US$8.6 billion assets).  However, the oil countries show&#13;
more banks and larger assets.   For example, Kuwait has the largest number of&#13;
banks with the largest combined assets on the list: six, with combined assets&#13;
of US$34.4 billion.&#13;
IV. Relations with Developing Countries:&#13;
Aid Institutions&#13;
Although the relations between the oil exporters and other developing&#13;
countries cover aid, direct investments, commercial credits, trade and labor&#13;
remittances, this paper concentrates on the first three activities. Arab aid&#13;
to developing countries is discussed in the present section, and Arab&#13;
commercial credit and investments in developing countries are discussed in&#13;
section V.&#13;
As already indicated in section II, Arab aid programs actually&#13;
started well before the first major oil price increase.  However, it was not&#13;
until the early 1970s that several Arab/OPEC countries allocated significant&#13;
portions of their national incomes to aid programs.   The cumulative size of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
OPEC aid through 1984 was US$79 billion, of which US$73 billion came from Arab&#13;
aid  sources.    Less  than  30 percent  of  those  flows  were managed  by aid&#13;
institutions, which distributed the resources roughly equally between African&#13;
and Asian developing countries, with a minor share going to Latin America.&#13;
Although aid was distributed among many sectors, special emphasis was placed&#13;
on infrastructure projects, particularly transport.&#13;
As a matter of convenience, Arab/OPEC aid institutions cofinanced&#13;
several development projects with international organizations.   Through the&#13;
cofinancing formula, the latter expanded their sources of funds while the&#13;
former overcame staff limitations and established project lending portfolios&#13;
in a short period. The formula continues to be operational.&#13;
OPEC Aid as A New Concept&#13;
The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development established in 1961 was&#13;
the first aid institution set up by a developing country to provide&#13;
concessional assistance to other developing countries (see section II,&#13;
Developments Prior to 1974).   This early Arab aid was motivated by ethical,&#13;
religious, and cultural considerations and an enlightened foreign policy, the&#13;
goal of which was to establish among Arab countries a vested interest in the&#13;
independence and prosperity of Kuwait.   The Kuwait aid program marked the&#13;
start of what later became a trend among several OPEC member countries. For a&#13;
period during the 1960s, the birth of this new world phenomenon was perceived&#13;
in some development circles as an anomaly.&#13;
The conditions surrounding the establishment of Kuwait's aid program&#13;
and of its executing agency, the Kuwait Fund, cannot be fully appreciated&#13;
without looking at some economic indicators for the OPEC members.   In 1960,&#13;
neither Kuwait's total oil revenues nor its GNP were extraordinary in&#13;
comparison with those of other OPEC countries.   However, when the country's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
then-tiny population of 280,000 is taken into account, Kuwait's per capita oil&#13;
revenue was several times that of the other founding members of OPEC the same&#13;
year: It was more than 12 times that of Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, more than&#13;
50 times  that of Iraq,  and more than 90 times that of Iran.   Even when&#13;
compared with per capita GNP in the industrially advanced countries, Kuwait's&#13;
was 5 times the median value, corresponding to per capita GNP in France or the&#13;
United Kingdom. Most impressive is the fact that Kuwait's 1960 per capita GNP&#13;
was twice as much as that of the United States. 34/&#13;
The  strong  participation  of  practically  all  OPEC members  in the&#13;
establishment  of  a relatively  large number  of bilateral  and multilateral&#13;
development agencies during a short period, some even before the first major&#13;
oil price increase, was a noteworthy development. For example, the Abu Dhabi&#13;
Fund for Arab Economic Development was established as a national aid agency in&#13;
July 1971, and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development was&#13;
established as a regional aid agency in December 1971.   Over the next five&#13;
years, OPEC members established five more bilateral aid agencies and&#13;
spearheaded  efforts  by  developing  countries  to  establish  seven  more&#13;
multilateral development agencies (table 5). 35/    By 1984, after less than&#13;
eight years of actual operations, the total authorized capital of the ten&#13;
major OPEC funds stood at US$28 billion, the paid-in capital at US$19 billion,&#13;
cumulative commitments at US$24 billion, and actual disbursements at US$16&#13;
billion.&#13;
The Overall Profile of OPEC Aid&#13;
Significant as the preceding figures appear, they pertain only to aid&#13;
flows  for  project  financing,  the  smaller  component  of OPEC  aid.   Other&#13;
components include the dominant category of general support assistance, as&#13;
well as non-project assistance. Through 1984, the cumulative net&#13;

disbursements of concessional assistance made by OE'EC member countries totaled&#13;
about US$79 billion in economic, not military, aid. Distributed over time in&#13;
relation to major oil price increases, these net aid flows may be estimated as&#13;
follows:    US$5  billion  through  1973  (before  the  first  major  oil  price&#13;
increase); US$31 billion during 1974-78 (after the first major oil price&#13;
increase but before the second); and US$43 billion during 1979-84 (when the&#13;
effects of the second major oil price increase were felt).&#13;
To be placed in perspective, these aid fLows should be related both&#13;
to the aid flows of other major sources (the Organization for Economic&#13;
Cooperation and Development [OECD] and the Council for Mutual Economic&#13;
Assistance [CMEA]) and to their collective GNP.   During the sub-period 1973-&#13;
84, ODA aid flows from OECD sources were US$244 billion and from CMEA US$25&#13;
billion; those from OPEC were US$77 billion (i.e., excluding pre-1973 aid),&#13;
and thus  represented 23 percent  of aid given by all major donors.   With&#13;
respect to group GNP, although the annual average aid flows from OECD were&#13;
about one-third of 1 percent, and the corresponding flow from CMEA less than&#13;
one-fifth of 1 percent, that of OPEC was about 2 percent (table 6).&#13;
The overall average of 2 percent durJing 1973-83 masks several&#13;
significant details. The first is the misleading notion that total aid flows&#13;
are to be related to the collective GNP of all OPEC members.  Given that the&#13;
low absorbers were the major sources of OPEC aid, it is more appropriate to&#13;
relate aid to the GNP of the low absorbers.   In that case, the ratio during&#13;
1973-84 becomes 4 percent, double the overall ratio.&#13;
For many years, several individual OPEC donors continued to grant aid&#13;
at ratios well above 4 percent of GNP, the overall average for the low&#13;
absorbers. The highest ratios were recorded in 1975, when they reached 7&#13;

percent for Kuwait, 8 percent for Saudi Arabia, 12 percent for U.A.E., and 16&#13;
percent for Qatar.   During the same period, three industrial countries, the&#13;
Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, reached a ratio of about 1 percent. 36/ Even&#13;
more significant is the fact that in absolute dollar terms, several OPEC&#13;
members ranked ahead of some of the most industrially advanced countries. For&#13;
example, since 1976, Saudi Arabia has been the second largest source of&#13;
concessionary aid, Kuwait has consistently ranked among the largest ten&#13;
donors, and UAE was a major donor during 1974-81.&#13;
Compared to the GNP of OECD or CMEA countries, that of the largest&#13;
OPEC aid sources is but a minute fraction.  In 1984, the combined GNP of the&#13;
five low absorbers was US$196 billion, equivalent to 2.3 percent of the&#13;
combined GNP of the OECD countries, and 7.3 percent of the combined GNP of the&#13;
CMEA countries. 371&#13;
Several  features  characterize  OPEC  aid  flows.    First,  OPEC  aid&#13;
originates from the liquidation of exhaustible oil resources.   The relative&#13;
sacrifice for individual OPEC members is, therefore, much higher than&#13;
suggested by the ratios of aid to GNP, already several times higher than those&#13;
of OECD countries.    Second,  unlike most OECD aid,  OPEC aid is generally&#13;
untied, especially with regard to the procurement of goods and services.  In&#13;
fact, in all but some insignificant cases, OPEC aid flows financed goods and&#13;
services produced in non-OPEC countries. Third, OPEC aid originates primarily&#13;
in  the Arab countries,  especially  the  so-called  low absorbers.    Fourth,&#13;
despite  the  high  visibility  of  OPEC  aid  institutions  in  international&#13;
development circles, the associated aid flows are but a small fraction of&#13;
total OPEC aid. Finally, within the OPEC aid institutions, national agencies&#13;
often have larger resources than multilateral agencies. 381&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
Although some of the aid flows were directed through multilateral&#13;
arrangements, most flowed through bilateral channels. About 24 percent of the&#13;
cumulative aid flows during 1968-84 went through multilateral channels: About&#13;
$12 billion in the government-to-government aid to Egypt, Jordan, and Syria&#13;
(15  percent),  and  $7 billion  in project  assistance  (9  percent).    Thus,&#13;
bilateral aid has been the dominant factor, representing 76 percent of OPEC&#13;
aid flows over time.   The preponderance of bilateral aid is to be expected,&#13;
since foreign aid is usually an important tool of a country's policy.&#13;
Bilateral  aid  is  distributed  among  three  categories:    general  support&#13;
assistance $41 billion (52 percent), non-project assistance $10 billion (13&#13;
percent), and project assistance $9 billion (11 percent).&#13;
The geographic distribution of the destination of the bilateral flows&#13;
is not easily documented, because Saudi Arabia--the leading donor--does not&#13;
provide detailed  information  on its bilateral  aid flows.   The  identified&#13;
bilateral  disbursements were distributed as follows:   Africa,  27 percent;&#13;
Asia, 66 percent; and Latin America, 7 percent of the total.   To be sure,&#13;
figures for Africa and Asia include flows to members of the League of Arab&#13;
States. The share of Arab countries in the identified bilateral disbursements&#13;
would be about 70 percent.&#13;
This concentrated pattern seems to be quite common in bilateral aid&#13;
flows worldwide. Typically, sources of concessional aid are tied to selected&#13;
recipient countries by factors of culture, politics, or economics. Thus, most&#13;
British aid goes to Commonwealth countries; French aid to francophone ex-&#13;
colonies; Soviet aid to socialist or quasi-socialist countries; and so on.&#13;
For more obvious reasons, the concentration of Arab bilateral aid in the other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Arab countries is thus a natural reflection of the long established ties among&#13;
the countries of the Arab region.&#13;
Activities of OPEC Aid Institutions&#13;
The first major oil price increase greatly expanded the capital of&#13;
existing institutions and enabled OPEC members to establish eleven additional&#13;
institutions   within  a  short   period   thereafter,   six  of  which  were&#13;
multilateral.  Similarly, the second major oil price increase further boosted&#13;
the liquidity position of OPEC countries and facilitated the significant&#13;
capital expansion of existing aid institutions.   Thus, in less than eight&#13;
years, the number of OPEC aid institutions expanded from four to fifteen and&#13;
their capital resources from US$1.2 billion to more than US$28.4 billion.&#13;
This expansion of capital resources helped broaden the scope of&#13;
activities   of   existing   aid   institutions,   both   geographically   and&#13;
functionally.   Although the scope of multilateral iregional aid institutions&#13;
remained the same, the scope of existing bilateral aid institutions expanded&#13;
from the regional to the international domain.  Botha the Kuwait Fund and the&#13;
Abu Dhabi Fund broadened their scope from Arab coLntries to the developing&#13;
world.    In  addition,  from  the  outset  most  of  the  post-1974  OPEC  aid&#13;
institutions--that is, the Saudi Fund, the Iraqi Fund, the Islamic Development&#13;
Bank, and the OPEC Fund--had a mandate that covered all developing countries.&#13;
The change in functional scope has been equally substantial.  Up to&#13;
1973, the activities of OPEC aid institutions were concentrated mainly on&#13;
project  financing.    This  form  of  assistance  often  ensures  that  certain&#13;
standards are applied in the identification and selection of projects;&#13;
moreover, it helps to increase the investment rate in recipient countries and&#13;
provides an element of technical assistance to those recipients. At the same&#13;
time, this form of assistance is characterized by long administrative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
involvement with feasibility studies, economic appraisals, and the drawing-up&#13;
of elaborate contracts,  and it takes time to disburse.   As a result, the&#13;
associated financial flows, whatever the volume of funds allocated or&#13;
committed,  tend to be constrained.   Hence, more and more OPEC donors have&#13;
resorted to general support grants and loans.&#13;
OPEC  aid  institutions  have  also  provided  investment  guarantees.&#13;
Direct investments, unlike aid, are based on the long-term mutual interests of&#13;
the source and host countries. To build a network of interdependent interests&#13;
in the region, the Arab members of OPEC sought to explore mechanisms to&#13;
encourage  inter-Arab  private  capital  flows.    The  Inter-Arab  Investments&#13;
Guarantee Corporation (IAICC) was thus established in 1974 to promote private&#13;
capital flows among Arab countries.  Although substantial private inter-Arab&#13;
investment flows did take place (estimated to have reached at least about US$5&#13;
billion), a small portion of these flows (some US$200 million) was channeled&#13;
into schemes involving IAIGC.  Such limitation was due mainly to the limited&#13;
capitalization of IAIGC itself.&#13;
The operations of the OPEC aid agencies reveal some interesting&#13;
patterns.   The geographic  distribution  of  loan commitments  made  by OPEC&#13;
development funds is shown in table 7. These allocations were about the same&#13;
as  those  for Africa and Asia:    US$10.6  billion  to Africa  (representing&#13;
43 percent of the total), US$10.7 billion to Asia (representing 44 percent),&#13;
and US$3.1 billion to Latin America and other countries (representing&#13;
13 percent).    Except  for  the Venezuelan Fund  (VIF), Africa's  share as a&#13;
recipient has not fallen below 41 percent in any OPEC aid institution, and it&#13;
has been 100 percent in BADEA.  By contrast, the share of Asian countries in&#13;
national OPEC agency allocations has been more than 50 percent (again&#13;

the statute of the Venezuelan Investment Fund (VIF), the amounts it dedicates to development&#13;
assistance at any given time cannot exceed 15 percent of its assets.  At the end of 1983, VIF's&#13;
development assistance was equivalent to US$2,498 million, as shown above.&#13;

excluding VIF), whereas it has been more variable in the multilateral&#13;
agencies:   40 percent from the Arab Fund, 43 percent from the OPEC Fund, and&#13;
56 percent from the Islamic Bank.  If Arab countries in Africa and Asia were&#13;
separated as a distinct group from the rest of OPEC aid recipients, their&#13;
share would be about US$11.1 billion (or 46 percent of the total).&#13;
As for total allocations as they stood at the end of 1984, the&#13;
Islamic Bank made the largest contribution (US$4.6 billion) representing 19&#13;
percent.   Both the Kuwait Fund and the Saudi Fund made the second largest&#13;
contributions (US$4.5 billion each), which represented about 18 percent&#13;
each.  The contribution of the Venezuelan Fund was US$3.0 billion, which was&#13;
equivalent  to  12 percent  of the total.   Two funds had roughly  the same&#13;
relative contribution:    the Arab Fund (US$2.2 billion) and the OPEC Fund&#13;
(US$2.0  billion),  each  representing  about  9 percent.  39/    The  smallest&#13;
relative contributions were made by BADEA and the Abu Dhabi Fund (about 5&#13;
percent each).&#13;
According to the sectoral distribution of loan commitments shown in&#13;
table 8, transport receives the largest allocation (31 percent), energy, the&#13;
second largest (23 percent), and agriculture, industry, and other roughly&#13;
equal shares,  about one-sixth each.   If transport, energy, and others are&#13;
combined in a broader definition of "infrastructure," they end up absorbing&#13;
two-thirds of total allocations. This is a perfectly natural corollary of the&#13;
relative needs of developing countries, and of the response of OPEC funds to&#13;
those needs.&#13;
Cofinancing Development Projects&#13;
Through 1983 about US$3.3 billion have been committed by Arab/OPEC&#13;
aid agencies to the financing of development projects with the World Bank.&#13;

about 17 percent of World Bank cofinancing with multilateral official&#13;
sources.  The three national funds--the Kuwait Fund, the Saudi Fund, and the&#13;

The cofinancing formula was found to be mutually attractive to the&#13;
World Bank and to the Arab/OPEC aid agencies.  The formula assists the World&#13;
Bank in mobilizing needed resources on a global scale to finance an increasing&#13;
number of larger and more expensive projects.  In 1970, the World Bank Group&#13;
(IBRD and IDA) made 119 loans for a total of U'S$2.2 billion, at an average&#13;
US$18 million per loan.  In 1983, the number of loans increased to 243 for a&#13;
total of US$14.5 billion, at an average US$60 inillion per loan. 40/  As a&#13;
result of the Bank's lending expansion, it has been borrowing increasingly in&#13;
the open market.   Meanwhile, these activities have coincided with the major&#13;
resource inflows to OPEC countries and the establishment of most of their&#13;
official aid agencies.&#13;
These same agencies saw in the cofinancing formula a useful vehicle&#13;
with which to overcome staffing limitations, that is, by quickly establishing&#13;
links with highly experienced institutions that could readily provide well-&#13;
studied projects.   When they were faced with staffing limitations in their&#13;
formative years, some Arab/OPEC funds recruited senior staff on secondment&#13;
from the World Bank.&#13;
V. Relations with Developing Countries:&#13;
Commercial Credit and Investment Institutions&#13;
Although aid has become a major activity of Arab financial&#13;
institutions in developing countries, other activities have also grown in&#13;
importance since the 1970s.  Orders of magnitude of cumulative flows through&#13;
1984 suggest that aid constituted 49 percent of the total, syndicated loans 27&#13;
percent, bonds 7 percent and direct investments 17 percent (table 10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Significantly, 83 percent of those flows were directed to developing&#13;
countries, especially in neighboring Arab countries.&#13;

Since 1977, Arab banks have become active in the market for&#13;
international  loan syndication.   One-fourth of these  loans have  been for&#13;
clients from OECD and socialist countries, and the remaining three-fourths for&#13;
clients  from  developing  countries.    During  this  time,  Arab  financial&#13;
institutions have begun to assume an increasing share of the total market for&#13;
loans and, in the process, some world-class Arab banks have begun to emerge.&#13;
Arab financial institutions have been active in public placements in&#13;
the bond market since 1974, but private placements started as early as 1968.&#13;
For several years, Kuwaiti banks took the lead by issuing Kuwaiti dinar-&#13;
denominated bonds.   By 1982 more than 500 publicly and privately placed bond&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
issues were made, about half of which were Eor clients in developing&#13;
countries.  However, most bonds issued by Arab barLks were denominated in U.S.&#13;
dollars, mainly because oil revenues were in U.S. dollars.  Arab banks also&#13;
participated in issuing and managing bonds denominated in other OECD&#13;
currencies.&#13;
The global distribution of Arab direct investments shows a heavy&#13;
concentration  in  OECD  and  Arab  nonoil  economies.    The  share  of  other&#13;
developing countries in Arab direct investments has been in the range of 5-10&#13;
percent. Furthermore, government investments appear to have predominated over&#13;
private  investments.      Considerations  of  size  tended  to  dictate  the&#13;
organizational framework of new investment projects; larger projects were&#13;
generally carried out through multilateral arrangements, whereas smaller&#13;
projects were bilaterally organized.   What is most significant is that Arab&#13;
investors  are not different  from investors anywhere  in their concern for&#13;
security,  return,  and growth potential.   This is equally true for private&#13;
individuals or agencies as for government investment institutions. Although,&#13;
inter-Arab direct investments and joint ventures cover a wide range of&#13;
projects and sectors, government institutions have focused more on petroleum&#13;
and mining  projects,  transport,  agro-industries,  and banking.   Similarly,&#13;
private investors have wide-ranging interests, but they have tended to focus&#13;
on manufacturing, banking, and real estate development.&#13;
The Internationally Syndicated Loan Market&#13;
Arab banks have participated in loan syndication in two ways: through&#13;
consortium banks, which helped to transfer relevant know-how to the staff of&#13;
Arab banks, and on their own, without the assistance of European banks. Table&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
11 shows the volume of Eurocurrency credits syndicated by Arab banks&#13;
distributed over time by the geographic location of recipients.&#13;
The participation of Arab banks in syndicated Eurocurrency credits&#13;
rapidly expanded from about US$1 billion in 1977, to US$4 billion in 1980, and&#13;
US$10 billion in 1982, but it dropped to less than US$6 billion in 1984.  On&#13;
the average, their annual lending rate during 1977-80 was about US$2 billion;&#13;
and during 1981-84 it was about US$8 billion.   This shift in the level of&#13;
syndicated loans by Arab banks was mainly due to increased exports of Arab&#13;
capital following the second major oil price increase.&#13;
The geographical distribution of these syndicated loans during 1977-&#13;
84 as a whole shows that the share of Arab clients was about 44 percent,&#13;
Western Europe 18 percent, Latin America 13 percent, Asia 17 percent, and sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa less than 2 percent.   The USSR and Eastern Europe also had&#13;
clients in the market for Eurocurrency loans syndicated by Arab banks; these&#13;
accounted for about 5 percent of the total.   A regrouping of these ratios&#13;
shows that 76 percent of the Arab syndicated loans went clients in developing&#13;
countries. Even though a substantial portion of the loans went to clients in&#13;
the non-oil Arab countries, 56 percent of the total went to clients outside&#13;
the Arab region.&#13;
Significant as these figures are, they need to be placed in the&#13;
proper context of the Eurocurrency credit market.   The volume of syndicated&#13;
loans in this market expanded quickly, from about US$42 billion in 1977 to a&#13;
peak of US$133 billion in 1981, fell to US$74 billion in 1983, but increased&#13;
to more than US$100 billion in 1984 (table 11). The international debt crisis&#13;
that preoccupied international finance and development circles in 1982 played&#13;
the decisive role in the substantial contraction of the Eurocurrency credit&#13;

market.    The  average  annual  share  of Arab  banks  in  these  flows  jumped&#13;
significantly from 3.4 percent during 1977-80 to about 8 percent during 1981-&#13;
84. This jump was due to two developments that occurred at the same time: the&#13;
major expansion in capital exports by Arab financial institutions and the&#13;
increased use of syndicated   Eurocurrency lending as a vehicle of capital&#13;
exports.    Significantly,  the  time  profile  of  Arab  Eurocurrency  lending&#13;
followed the general time profile of the syndicated Eurocurrency Loan market&#13;
as a whole.   In fact, in 1981-84 Arab lending dropped by 37 percent, while&#13;
total market lending dropped by 25 percent. It should be noted, however, that&#13;
syndicated Eurocurrency lending is only one part of international lending. In&#13;
relation to total international lending, the lending of Arab banks would&#13;
account for a much smaller proportion of the total. 41/&#13;
Cultural and practical factors also play an important role in Arab-&#13;
syndicated Eurocurrency loans. Arab clients have a large share in these loans&#13;
because the lead managers of such loans are most familiar with the economic&#13;
and financial conditions of that part of the world.   The share of European&#13;
clients is also substantial because many lead managers have European partners&#13;
who are familiar with European countries and the credit worthiness of the&#13;
customers.&#13;
The totals for 1977-84 as a whole mask some interesting annual&#13;
developments.    For  example,  the  share  of  the  Arab  clients  fluctuated&#13;
significantly: from 70 percent in 1977 and 1978, to 25 percent in 1980, up to&#13;
55 percent in 1983, and down to 45 percent in 1984. They seem to have played&#13;
the role of "swing borrowers". The share of clients from the USSR and Eastern&#13;
Europe has declined.   The share of Latin American clients increased quickly,&#13;
but then declined even faster after 1982, when the Latin American debt crisis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
loomed large on the international horizon. The share of Asian clients picked&#13;
up significantly after 1979, from an average of 6 percent to an average of&#13;
about 19 percent, indicating both increased familiarity of Arab banks with&#13;
Asian clients, and expansion in Arab-Asian business ties.&#13;
The institutions responsible for the syndicated loans are numerous&#13;
and their shares vary widely as seen from a compilation of activities during&#13;
1979-83.   Largest among these institutions are the Gulf International Bank&#13;
(GIB, US$4.8 billion) and the Arab Banking Corporation (ABC, US$4.6&#13;
billion).   Above the US$2 billion level were the National Commercial Bank of&#13;
Saudi Arabia, the Arab Bank Group, the National 13ank of Kuwait, and the UBAF&#13;
group.   In the US$1 to US$2 billion range were KFTCIC, the BAII Group, the&#13;
Saudi  International   Bank,   and  the  Arab  African  International   Bank.&#13;
Significantly, the 20 leading Arab banks accounled for about 88 percent of&#13;
total syndicated Eurocurrency loans during 1979-83, while the remaining 12&#13;
percent were handled by some 30 smaller banks. 42/&#13;
The customers of Arab-syndicated loans include corporations that are&#13;
among the largest and best-known throughout the world. The maturity structure&#13;
varies from one to ten years, and the size of the loan also varies, from US$3&#13;
to US$300 million.   The number of loans concluded every year to non-Arab&#13;
borrowers is indicative of the tempo of business expansion: 2 loans in 1977,&#13;
7 loans in 1978 (the largest, US$70 million, to Yugoslav banks), 10 loans in&#13;
1979 (the largest, US$90 million, also to Yugoslav banks), 18 loans in 1980&#13;
(the largest, US$300 million, to Bank of China), 27 loans in 1981 (the&#13;
largest, US$260 million, to BANADE of Brazil), 24 loans in 1982 (the largest,&#13;
US$250 million, to the National Bank of Yugoslavia), and 8 loans in the first&#13;
half of 1983 (the largest, US$117.5 million, to Cia. Sevillana de Electricidad&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
of Spain).   Although most of these loans were denominated in U.S. dollars,&#13;
some were in German deutschmark, Japanese yen, and French francs, among&#13;
others. 43/&#13;
Interestingly, Eurocurrency loan syndication, the most recent&#13;
activity of Arab banks, now accounts for a major portion of their cumulative&#13;
international financial flows (table 10).  Loan syndication started modestly&#13;
in 1977, by which time Arab banks had already been engaged in bond issues&#13;
(worth a cumulative amount of US$1 billion) for about a decade, and in direct&#13;
investments (worth a cumulative US$5.5 billion) for even longer. Eurocurrency&#13;
loan syndication has appealed to Arab banks, particularly to newly established&#13;
banks, because it has enabled them to expand capital exports from Arab&#13;
countries but has not required specialized skills on the part of staff,&#13;
because European participants did provide such skills and know-how.  For the&#13;
newly established Arab banks, eager to show significant results to their&#13;
constituencies in a short period, loan syndication was both an effective and&#13;
suitable  formula.   Euroloan  syndication appears to have lost  some of its&#13;
appeal, however, in that the market has contracted substantially since&#13;
reaching a peak in 1981.&#13;
The International Bond Market&#13;
Arab institutions participated in the international bond market for&#13;
the first time in 1968 with private placements for World Bank bonds,&#13;
denominated in Kuwaiti dinar.   Betwen 1968 and 1973, they concluded six such&#13;
placements having a total equivalent value of about US$450 million. Most were&#13;
carried  through the Kuwait  Investment  Company (KIC).   In 1974 four bonds&#13;
denominated in Kuwaiti dinar were issued--one was issued privately by KIC to&#13;
the Asian Development Bank, and three were lead-managed public issues (one by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
KIIC and two by KFTCIC) to public entities in the l?hilippines, Austria, and&#13;
Ireland.   From that point on, the KD bond market expanded both in size and&#13;
coverage  (table  12).   In  1976, Arab  institutions  began to manage  bonds&#13;
denominated in UAE dirham, Bahrini dinar, and Saudi riyal, among others. Then&#13;
in 1977 they started handling a few bonds denominated in U.S. dollars, but the&#13;
substantial expansion did not occur until 1980.&#13;
Between 1974 and 1982, Kuwaiti institutions placed 98 KD bond issues&#13;
totaling KD 694 million, or about US$2.5 billion.   These together with the&#13;
1968-73 issues added up to 104 issues with a total value of about US$2.9&#13;
billion. Of these, 17 (valued at US$850 million) were private placements and&#13;
the remaining 87 were public placements. KIIC lead-managed the largest number&#13;
of bonds, equivalent in value to the combined issues of KIC and KFTCIC.  The&#13;
"three K's" dominated the Kuwaiti dinar bond market, leaving only a handful of&#13;
bonds to be managed by other smaller investment banks.&#13;
The list of borrowers includes banks and public enterprises&#13;
throughout the world. The geographical distribution of the KD bonds publicly&#13;
issued to foreign entities showed a heavy concentration of borrowers in OECD&#13;
countries (25 bonds), followed by Latin America (14 bonds) and East Europe (13&#13;
bonds).    Arab  and  Asian  borrowers  came  next,  with  10  and  9  bonds,&#13;
respectively.   Only two bonds were made to African institutions--these were&#13;
issued to the African Development Bank in 1977.  Thus, about half of the KD&#13;
bonds issued to foreign entities were for clients in developing countries, who&#13;
were judged like others, on the basis of their credit worthiness and ability&#13;
to repay principal and interest.&#13;
Arab banks (including Kuwaiti institutions) have been more involved&#13;
in lead-managing bonds denominated in other currencies, mostly in U.S. dollars&#13;

because, as already mentioned in the discussion of Euroloan syndication,&#13;
payments for oil are typically made in U.S. dollars.   Other currency bonds&#13;
included issues in French francs, Dutch guilder, German deutschmark, Japanese&#13;
yen, Canadian dollars, and British sterling, among many others. Although Arab&#13;
banks were involved in managing international bond issues before 1979, that&#13;
year marked their first large-scale participation in bonds denominated in a&#13;
wide variety of currencies.   The large inflows of Eunds following the second&#13;
major oil price increase must have emboldened the managing institutions and&#13;
boosted their confidence.   Although the number and value of bonds issued by&#13;
Arab banks in the U.S. dollar sector before 1979 are not known, it is believed&#13;
that the total number of bonds issued by Arab banks in all sectors during&#13;
1968-82 must have been greater than 500; table 12 identifies 488 that exclude&#13;
bonds issued in the U.S. dollar sector in 1977 and 1978.  The total value of&#13;
all bond issues was equivalent to US$7.2 billion, US$4.9 billion of which were&#13;
issued during 1979-82 alone.   A total of 412 bonds were issued during this&#13;
subperiod,  66 percent of which were in the U.S. dollar sector.   In value&#13;
terms, the U.S. dollar sector was 60 percent of the total during the 1974-82.&#13;
As table 10 has shown, Arab banks have been least active in managing&#13;
Eurobonds. The question is: Why? The reasons rest partly with the nature of&#13;
the Eurobond market and partly with the Arab banks themselves.   Bonds are&#13;
inherently difficult  to handle because of the complex structure needed to&#13;
manage them and the diverse skills required to man such structure, a task that&#13;
involves   project   evaluation,   risk  assessment   and  monitoring,   legal&#13;
documentation, negotiation, disbursements and conditionality, connections for&#13;
placements, secondary markets, and so on.  Nor has it been easy for new comers&#13;
like Arab banks to break into the international bond market, which up to now&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
has been dominated by a closely-knit fraternity of underwriters.   By and&#13;
large, Eurobonds have remained the coveted domain of a select group of finance&#13;
houses that pionered the instruments two decades ago and have since developed&#13;
lasting ties with the issuers, whether corporate or sovereign.&#13;
As newcomers, Arab financial intermediaries have become aware of the&#13;
need to develop both a risk-taking approach to the underwriting of new issues&#13;
and  a  wider  circle  of  placements.    The  reluctance  to  take  risks  is&#13;
fundamentally due to the shortage of Arab investment bankers with enough&#13;
experience,  high-level  professionalism,  and  wide  connections.    The  small&#13;
circle of securities clients has been the result of Arab banks limiting their&#13;
scope of placement to their home governments or to their own account.&#13;
However, judging by some partial evidence in 1985, it appars that this circle&#13;
has begun tc grow significantly by serving clients from the industrial&#13;
countries.&#13;
Furthermore, a significant potential exists for greater involvement&#13;
in the Eurobond market, primarily through Arab clients who have recently&#13;
entered, or might enter, the Eurobond market as borrowers. Arab institutions&#13;
that have entered the market include banks such as ABC, Al-Ahli of Kuwait,&#13;
FRAB, BAII, and National Commercial Bank of Jeddah; and sovereign entities&#13;
such as Morocco,  Algeria,  and Tunisia.   Equally significant is the rapid&#13;
growth of the Eurobond market from US$55 billion in 1981 to US$100 billion in&#13;
1984/85  44/.   This  growth,  which has  coincided with the decline in the&#13;
syndicated Euroloan market mentioned above, reflects a global trend toward the&#13;
"securitization" of borrowings.  Ultimately, if Arab banks are to become more&#13;
active participants in the Eurobond market and/or the lead-managers of&#13;
Eurobond issues for Arab borrowers, they must establish a more solid record of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
experience.    Only  in  this  way  will  they  develop  a  greater  degree  of&#13;
professionalism, innovation, and placement ability. 45/&#13;
Direct Investments and Joint Ventures&#13;
Investment institutions have special significance because of the&#13;
magnified effects they create in host economies and the additional resources&#13;
they help mobilize in source countries beyond the confines of their original&#13;
size. Compared with the other forms of capital flows to developing countries&#13;
from Arab sources, direct investment flows appear to be sizable.   Although&#13;
such flows are not easy to estimate it is instruc-ive to piece together the&#13;
available sketchy information.   This makes it possible to at least identify&#13;
the major sources, consider their distribution among countries and sectors,&#13;
and examine the factors underlying the emerging patterns.&#13;
The first indication of the size of Arab clirect investments portrays&#13;
the situation in 1975.   At  that  time,  total Arab commitments  for direct&#13;
investment ventures were estimated to be about U'S$5 billion, 23 percent of&#13;
which were in OECD countries and 77 percent in deveLoping countries, primarily&#13;
in the Arab region.   Most of these investments came from Saudi Arabia (54&#13;
percent) and Kuwait (29 percent), and to a lesser extent from UAE (8 percent)&#13;
and Iraq (7 percent). 46/&#13;
The above figures should be treated with caution because they are&#13;
estimates of contractual commitments by investors in the oil countries and&#13;
have been compiled somewhat randomly from occasional announcements in two&#13;
specialized publications on the Middle East:   Middle East Economic Digest&#13;
(MEED) and Middle East Economic Survey (MEES).   Furthermore,  it is highly&#13;
likely that actual direct investments made through 1975 were smaller than&#13;
these contractual commitments, especially if some of the expenditures went to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
new projects, where a lag of several years usually separates contractual&#13;
commitments from project completion.   Therefore,  the US$5 billion cited is&#13;
likely to be an exaggerated estimate of actual direct investment flows through&#13;
1975.&#13;
Several years later, Chase World Information Corporation published a&#13;
comprehensive account of direct investments made by Arabs both within and&#13;
outside the Arab region. Although the report limits discussion of investment&#13;
sources to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and UAE and of investment hosts to the United&#13;
States and United Kingdom, it does distinguish between government and private&#13;
investors. However, many of the investments in the United States and United&#13;
Kingdom are not given a monetary value.   For example, the report lists 72&#13;
ventures as direct investments in the United States, but cites a monetary&#13;
value (adding up to less than US$600 million) for only 42.   For the United&#13;
Kingdom, it cites 49 ventures but indicates the monetary value (adding up to&#13;
less than US$500 million) for only 11. 471 From the other sources of data, it&#13;
appears that combined Arab direct investments in the United States and United&#13;
Kingdom in the early 1980s were on the order of US$6 billion, and the rest of&#13;
OECD  accounts  for  another US$3  billion.  48/        By contrast,  Arab  direct&#13;
investments in developing countries were overwhelmingly concentrated in the&#13;
Arab region, to the tune of some US$14 billion, 49/ which represents more than&#13;
85 percent of total Arab direct investments in developing countries, as will&#13;
be shown below.&#13;
Although estimates of direct private investments continue to be&#13;
tentative, those for government investments tend to be generally more reliable&#13;
because they are a matter of public record.   As explained below,  it was&#13;
possible to trace 57 governmental investment ventures in the Arab region; they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
had a total capitalized value of about US$9.6 billion.   By contrast,  99&#13;
private or mixed (private/government) inter-Arab direct investment ventures&#13;
could  be  identified;  their  total value was US$2.5 billion.   Only US$1.3&#13;
billion of this amount was contributed by private investors from the oil&#13;
countries.     Another  US$3.5  billion  is  conservatively  estimated  to  be&#13;
unidentified inter-Arab private direct investments; this brings the total to&#13;
less  than  US$5  billion.    The  following  discussion distinguishes  between&#13;
government and private direct investments.   It treats all Arab banks as a&#13;
special form of direct investment in developing countries.&#13;
(a) Inter-Arab Government Investments&#13;
Arab governments have made direct investments in the Arab region in&#13;
different ways.   Some have channeled funds through multilateral investment&#13;
consortia to finance and promote the development af specific sectors or of&#13;
private enterprise in general.   Examples are the consortia set up to finance&#13;
and promote investments in petroleum, mining, agribusiness, fisheries,&#13;
livestock, drugs, or medical appliance sectors (see annex A, table 1). One of&#13;
the institutions set up to promote the development of private enterprise is&#13;
the Arab Investment Company, which was modeled along the lines of the&#13;
International  Finance Corporation,  an affiliate  oil the World Bank.   Arab&#13;
governments have also participated in multilateral joint ventures directly&#13;
involved in specific sectors, such as industry, services, or banking and&#13;
finance.   Aside from these multilateral institutions, Arab governments have&#13;
set up national or bilateral investment corporations (annex A, table 2) as&#13;
well as national/bilateral joint ventures in industry, services, or banking&#13;
and finance  (annex A,  table 3).   The structure of (identified)  inter-Arab&#13;
government direct investments is summarized in table 13.&#13;
&#13;

Thus, Arab governments collectively or individually have put up&#13;
resources close to US$3.8 billion for specialized or general-purpose&#13;
investment institutions, and they have put up about US$5.7 billion to expand&#13;
the productive capacity in some key sectors in host Arab countries.&#13;
Investment institutions are usually instrumental in creating local enterprises&#13;
and thus in adding severalfold to their original size. Examples abound, three&#13;
of which may be cited from Lebanon, Egypt, and Sudan.  The Kuwaiti-Lebanese&#13;
Intra Investment Company is a major shareholder of El Mashrek Bank, Port of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
Beirut, and Middle East Airlines. The Kuwait-Egypt Investment Company helped&#13;
establish several joint ventures in the manufacturing of shoes, building&#13;
materials, marble and granite, and plastic pipe, as well as in tourism and&#13;
hotels.     The  Sudanese-Kuwaiti  Investment  Company  was  instrumental  in&#13;
establishing a number of joint ventures in building and construction, road&#13;
transport, and livestock production.&#13;
Table 13 also shows the dominant weight of multilateral institutions&#13;
(about  two-thirds)  in  total  government  investments.         Most  of  these&#13;
institutions were established shortly after 1973, in response to a new mood&#13;
and a peak of inter-Arab economic solidarity never experienced to the same&#13;
extent before or after. The rise of multilateral institutions during the mid-&#13;
1970s may have reflected in part the desire of other capital surplus&#13;
governments not to go through the same experience of learning by doing as&#13;
Kuwait had earlier. This suggestion can be supported on two grounds: (a) the&#13;
time lag necessary under the circumstances to develop successful international&#13;
investment institutions; and (b) the risk-sharing appeal of the multilateral&#13;
formula,  especially  if it brings  along Kuwaiti  experience and management&#13;
skills.  The freezing of Egypt's membership in these organizations, following&#13;
the Camp David accords with Israel in 1979,  shifted the location of some&#13;
multilateral institutions from Egypt to other countries (e.g., ACDIMA moved&#13;
from Cairo to Amman) and seriously disrupted the activity of others (the Gulf&#13;
Organization for Military Industries).&#13;
Eleven Arab states, both rich and poor, have hosted multilateral&#13;
institutions.    Among  the  rich  states,  Bahrain  has  a  hosted  5  such&#13;
institutions, Kuwait 2, Libya 2, Saudi Arabia 3, and UAE 1.  Among the poor&#13;
states, Egypt has hosted 4, Jordan 4, Mauritania 1, Sudan 3, Syria 1, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
North Yemen 1.  In addition, ten Arab states have hosted national/bilateral&#13;
institutions.   Among the rich, Kuwait has hosted 6, Oman 3, Saudi Arabia 1,&#13;
and UAE 2. Among the poor, Egypt has hosted 7, Jordan 2, Mauritania 1, Sudan&#13;
2, Syria 1, and Tunisia 2 (annex A, tables 1, 2, 3).&#13;
If these intergovernmental investments were made to capture a long-&#13;
term potential, they were not entirely set up on the basis of financial or&#13;
economic criteria. Although political considerations did play a role, both in&#13;
their establishment and the location of their headquarters, they were not the&#13;
dominant factor; rather, economics played the major role. If it was a mix of&#13;
politics and economics that guided inter-Arab government investments, a mix of&#13;
culture  and  economics  appears  to  have  motivated  inter-Arab  private&#13;
investments, as noted below.&#13;
(b) Inter-Arab Private Investments&#13;
Data were available for only 99 inter-Arab private investment&#13;
ventures (annex B). Their total value equals about US$2,510 million, of which&#13;
US$1,340 million was paid-in capital contribution by private investors in the&#13;
oil countries.   Observers of direct investment ventures in the Arab region&#13;
believe that there must be several hundred inter-Arab private investment&#13;
ventures. 50/  If the identified investments are conservatively estimated to&#13;
represent about one-fourth of what actually exists, the total contribution of&#13;
private investments from the oil-exporting countries rises to about US$5&#13;
billion.   The group of projects identified in the present study may thus be&#13;
construed as a sample, and possibly a biased sample, of inter-Arab private&#13;
direct investments. The bias will become clear as the analysis proceeds.&#13;
Whereas  Kuwaiti  private  investors  dominate  inter-Arab  direct&#13;
investments, investors from Saudi Arabia and UAE generally prefer multilateral&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
formats, especially those led by Kuwaiti investors.   According to the data,&#13;
private Kuwaiti  participation  is overwhelming.   About  67 percent  of the&#13;
identified joint ventures are exclusively owned or controlled by Kuwaiti&#13;
investors.    In value terms,  the dominance of Kuwaiti  investors  is even&#13;
greater, amounting to about 88 percent.   This may in part be due to excess&#13;
liquidity in Kuwait and the ban imposed in the mid-1970s on registering&#13;
shareholding companies on the Kuwaiti stock exchange. The other ventures that&#13;
show exclusive or shared participation by private investors from Saudi Arabia&#13;
or UAE appear to be downwardly biased--they account for only 12 percent of the&#13;
total contribution of inter-Arab private direct investments.&#13;
Private direct investment ventures were identified in several Arab&#13;
countries: Bahrain (28.2 percent), Egypt (1.5 percent), Jordan (2.5 percent),&#13;
Lebanon (0.2 percent), Mauritania (0.7 percent), Morocco (2.5 percent), Oman&#13;
(0.1 percent), Saudi Arabia (0.6 percent), Somalia (0.4 percent), Sudan (4.7&#13;
percent), Tunisia (0.7 percent), UAE (56.2 percent), and North Yemen (1.6&#13;
percent) (see annex B).   Thus, more than 50 percent of inter-Arab private&#13;
direct investments are located in one country, and more than 84 percent in&#13;
two.&#13;
Several factors explain the dominance of Bahrain and UAE as hosts to&#13;
private direct  investments  originating  in sister oil states:   geographic&#13;
proximity; a shared culture and tradition; access to excellent financial&#13;
services; conducive local business and social environment; and the absence of&#13;
restrictive legislation.   Furthermore,  as already indicated in Section III&#13;
above, Bahrain's oil reserves will be depleted in the not-too-distant future&#13;
and its policymakers are looking to Arab direct investments to diversify the&#13;
island's economic base and help it continue to grow. In the UAE, some of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77-&#13;
emirates have no oil (Sharjah, Ajman, Ras al Khaimah) and depend almost&#13;
exclusively on nonoil activities  for their  livelihood.   Nevertheless,  it&#13;
appears that the relative weight of Bahrain and UAE among countries hosting&#13;
inter-Arab private direct investments is probably exaggerated, much as the&#13;
relative weight of other countries--such as Egypt, Lebanon, and Tunisia--is&#13;
downwardly biased.&#13;
Some Arab countries are notably absent from the host list, and others&#13;
that are themselves the source of large investments are included.   Libya,&#13;
Syria, Algeria, and South Yemen do not appear on the compiled list of annex B&#13;
as hosts of inter-Arab private direct investments, even though it is commonly&#13;
known that Syria hosts sizable private investments from the Gulf states in the&#13;
real estate sector and that Libya and Syria host government investments.  In&#13;
general, however, the socialist orientation, public policy, and legislation in&#13;
these countries may appear to be in conflict with private direct invest-&#13;
ments.   By contrast, the liberal market orientation of Saudi Arabia and UAE&#13;
places them on the list, even though they are among the major sources of such&#13;
investments.&#13;
The frequency distribution of identified private direct investment&#13;
ventures by sector shows six significant clusterings.  With respect to total&#13;
paid-in capital, the following relative sectoral weights were calculated:&#13;
real estate (12.4 percent); manufacturing (33.8 percent); banking, insurance,&#13;
and finance (35.3 percent); mining (6.7 percent); agribusiness (5.3 percent);&#13;
and services and other (6.4 percent) (see annex B). Whereas the dominance of&#13;
banking and finance was more or less expected, the relatively small share of&#13;
real estate and the relatively large share of manufacturing appear to be&#13;
somewhat  surprising.    Countries  that  are  widely  known  to  have  major&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
investments in the real estate sector--for example, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan,&#13;
Lebanon, and Tunisia--do not  show up in the talbulations.   If real estate&#13;
investments had been properly traced, or investors had been willing to provide&#13;
more information, the relative share of the real estate sector would&#13;
undoubtedly have been adjusted upward, simultaneously reducing the relative&#13;
shares of all the other sectors.&#13;
The sectoral distribution of investments by country shows that&#13;
manufacturing  and  banking,  followed  by  services,  are  the  most  common&#13;
activities  to  attract  investors  in almost  all  the countries.    The  same&#13;
distribution also shows that real estate is concentrated mainly in Morocco and&#13;
UAE, mining in Bahrain and Morocco, and agribusiness in Sudan and UAE.&#13;
Insofar as private investments are concerned, i't seems unusual to find no&#13;
agribusiness investment ventures in countries with a natural advantage, such&#13;
as Egypt,  Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, or Tunisia.   The problem here is that&#13;
inter-Arab private investment ventures in general are difficult to trace, and&#13;
even when they are properly traced, they do not provide much information.&#13;
This spread of inter-Arab private investment activity needs to be&#13;
placed in the proper context of the Arab business environment.  In most Arab&#13;
countries,  direct  investments  face formidable barriers,  particularly:   (1)&#13;
inadequate infrastructure, including transportation, telecommunications, air&#13;
and  sea  ports,  business  support  services,  and  so  on;  (2)    widespread&#13;
bureaucratic red tape, especially in countries withi a social orientation, such&#13;
as Egypt, Sudan, Syria, even though the state policy is expressly "open door";&#13;
(3) currency restrictions in transferring investment profits to countries of&#13;
origin; and (4)   a shortage of skilled staff for new investment ventures,&#13;
especially in management positions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
Notwithstanding   these   barriers,   inter-Arab   direct   investment&#13;
ventures, both government and private, have expanded and continue to expand.&#13;
Foremost  among  the  factors  inducing  continued  expansion  are:    (1)  the&#13;
proximity and easy access to investment sources and investment hosts; (2)&#13;
investors' familiarity with the culture and language of the hosts, and vice&#13;
versa; (3) weak enforcement of income tax and other relevant business taxes;&#13;
and (4) the sizable returns on investments.&#13;
(c) Arab Petrocapital Banks in Developing Countries&#13;
Although most Arab direct investment ventures in developing countries&#13;
are located in the Arab region itself, some exist outside the region, most&#13;
notably in the banking and finance sector.   The total number of inter-Arab&#13;
banking ventures within the Arab region itself is 79, but Arab banks in other&#13;
developing countries are not far behind with 60 (table 14).&#13;

Countries that host Arab petrodollar banks, both commercial (C) and&#13;
investment  (I),  in the Arab region are as follows:   Djibouti  (1C);  Egypt&#13;
(14C/9I); Jordan (8C/31); Lebanon (14C/2I); Mauritania (2C); Morocco (lC/lI);&#13;
Oman (8C); Somalia (1C); Sudan (3C/3I); and Tunisia (3C/6I). In Africa, Arab&#13;
banks are only commercial. The following countries have one bank each: Chad,&#13;
Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal,&#13;
Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Togo, and Uganda. In Asia, the following&#13;
countries host Arab petrocapital banks:   Bangladesh (IC); Hong Kong (10C);&#13;
India (3C/MI); Indonesia (IC); South Korea (4C); Malaysia (2I); Pakistan&#13;
M5C/3M); Singapore (IC); and Sri Lanka (3C).  Finally, in Latin America the&#13;
host countries are: Brazil (2CM2M); Colombia (1C); Panama (4C); Peru (1C); and&#13;
Venezuela (1C).&#13;
The commercial banks--whether branches, representative offices, or&#13;
joint ventures--are engaged mainly in financing trade flows, either within the&#13;
Arab region, or between the Arab region and other countries.   These include&#13;
petroleum exports from the Arab countries to the rest of developing countries&#13;
and exports from those countries to the rapidly expanding Arab markets.   In&#13;
some cases, commercial banks channel the savings of hundreds of thousands of&#13;
workers to their countries of origin, primarily Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, Turkey,&#13;
Bangladesh, India, South Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.&#13;
The joint venture Arab investment banks in developing countries&#13;
outside the Arab region are comrised of six in Asia and two in Latin&#13;
America. These banks have been active "advance posts" for Arab petrocapital,&#13;
canvassing the local scenes for attractive investment opportunities in a wide&#13;
variety of  sectors.   They have mobilized resources  not  only  in the host&#13;
countries, but also in countries of origin, ;ometimes from sources not&#13;
directly involved with parent institutions.&#13;

VI. Future Prospects&#13;
This paper concludes with an assessment of the future prospects of&#13;
Arab financial institutions in developing countries. The activities of these&#13;
institutions during the 1970s and early 1980s were shaped largely by&#13;
continuously increasing oil revenues and the associated capital surplus. How&#13;
the recent decline in oil revenues and the drawdown of the surplus will affect&#13;
these activities in the remainder of 1980s and in the 1990s remains to be&#13;
seen.&#13;
The first point to note is that oil prices during the 1980s are more&#13;
likely to be determined by the free interplay of supply and demand in the&#13;
international oil market.   By 1985,  this market was  showing considerable&#13;
softening and oil prices were drifting downwards. The associated high supply&#13;
elasticity in most OPEC members was caused by idle oil production capacity.&#13;
Future increases in oil revenues for the individual oil exporters, if any,&#13;
will thus come from increases in the quantity of exported oil.&#13;
The drop in OPEC oil revenues since 1981 has been associated with&#13;
various changes in government expenditures, which have hitherto been the&#13;
engine  of  growth  in  member  countries.         Although  government  current&#13;
expenditures have declined somewhat in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and UAE, they have&#13;
continued  to expand  at modest  rates  in Kuwait.   By contrast,  government&#13;
investment or development expenditures have declined substantially below their&#13;
1981 peak levels, for example, in the UAE by 35 percent and in Saudi Arabia by&#13;
37 percent. 51/  All these countries have introduced fiscal discipline after&#13;
years of accelerating expansion.   At the same time, a recession of major&#13;
proportions has begun to develop and has already reduced private incomes and&#13;
&#13;

- 82 -&#13;
expenditures.    During  the  remainder  of  the  1980s,  however,  government&#13;
expenditures in nearly all OPEC countries are expected to increase owing to&#13;
demographic expansion.&#13;
In the face of these trends if OPEC oil revenues decline or cease to&#13;
increase, OPEC governments will incur budgetary deficits which must be&#13;
financed through either external borrowing or drawdown of reserves and&#13;
investments abroad.   In the latter, maintenance of the principal  sums  is&#13;
possible only if the size of budgetary deficits is limited to the income&#13;
generated from financial placements and investments abroad, estimated roughly&#13;
at about US$6 billions for Kuwait, US$2 billions for Libya, US$1 billion for&#13;
Qatar, US$12 billions for Saudi Arabia, and US$3 billions for UAE.  Some of&#13;
these countries may have to dip into the principal of their investments, as&#13;
was indeed the case in Saudi Arabia during 1983-84 and 1984-85. 52/  Other&#13;
OPEC members have already gone beyond their accumulated surpluses:  Algeria,&#13;
Ecuador, Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, and Nigeria have even accumulated large&#13;
debts.   The accumulated surplus attained in 1981 was not only a historical&#13;
peak for OPEC collectively, but also a peak for most individual member&#13;
countries, who started their withdrawals shortly thereafter.&#13;
As a result, Arab/OPEC aid has declined steadily since that time.&#13;
Although aid disbursements in 1984 were less than one half of their 1980 peak&#13;
level, their ratio to GNP in the relevant donor countries continued to exceed&#13;
2 percent, which is several times the ratio associated with other sources of&#13;
concessional assistance (OECD, CMEA).   During the rest of the 1980s, total&#13;
Arab/OPEC aid, especially from bilateral sources, may decline further because&#13;
the donor countries will most likely continue to bea squeezed by stagnant or&#13;
declining  oil  revenues  and  rising government  exp,snditures.   However,  the&#13;
smaller portion of aid flows managed by Arab/OPEC development funds for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
project  financing  or  program  loans  may  not  decline  markedly.    Recent&#13;
statements suggests that the disbursements of some funds may stabilize or&#13;
possibly increase somewhat through 1990.&#13;
Aside from aid, the present financial crisis in a number of OPEC&#13;
countries may tend to cast a shadow on or exagerate the potential damage for&#13;
commercial and investment prospects of Arab financial institutions, especially&#13;
in regard to their activities in developing countries. For this reason, it is&#13;
necessary to assess the business opportunities and challenges which are likely&#13;
to face Arab financial institutions during the next few years.&#13;
The rapid expansion in the trade flows of OPEC countries boosted the&#13;
profits of Arab banks active in trade financing and encouraged those banks to&#13;
establish a major presence beyond their national borders (see section III).&#13;
In 1971 the imports of OPEC countries totaled about US$11 billion and exports&#13;
about US$21 billion.   By 1983, these figures had risen to US$139 billion and&#13;
US$193 billion, respectively.   A decline in the volume of this trade due to&#13;
diminished economic activity in the trading countries--such as the one that&#13;
has been taking place since the early 1980s--is unlikely to continue&#13;
indefinitely  into  the  future.    Financing  of  import  trade  is  likely  to&#13;
stabilize in the near term to the tune of US$120 billion per year--a sizable&#13;
figure by any standard.&#13;
The trade flows between OPEC countries and developing countries also&#13;
grew rapidly between 1971 and 1983: Imports rose from US$1.2 billion to about&#13;
US$27 billion, and exports from US$3.5 billion to US$57 billion. 531  This&#13;
expansion was at least partly responsible for the rapid growth of Arab banks&#13;
in developing countries.   Significantly, the recent contraction in the total&#13;
trade flows of OPEC countries was accompanied by a less proportionate&#13;
contraction in their trade with developing countries. It is unclear, however,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
whether this outcome was the result of conscious decisions by the trading&#13;
partners.&#13;
The prospects for international activities of Arab banks, both in&#13;
medium- and long-term financial and direct investments, appear to be uneven.&#13;
Institutions participating in Euroloan syndication or Eurobond management are&#13;
facing a more difficult and uncertain environment than they did during the&#13;
affluent years.  The international debt crisis, which is looming greater than&#13;
ever, has already caused substantial shrinkage ir the syndicated Euroloan&#13;
market from 1981 to 1983, the period in which Arab banks increased their share&#13;
in that market.   Compared to other banks, however, Arab banks have financed&#13;
only a small portion of Latin American debts. Although there are some signs&#13;
that the syndicated Euroloan market may be revived, Arab banks are reluctant&#13;
to participate fully, especially now that oil revenues and investable&#13;
surpluses have declined. At the same time, to the extent that the total demand&#13;
for medium-term and long-term credit by developed and developing countries is&#13;
continuing to grow, the Eurobond market has expanded significantly. This has&#13;
been in part a response to the shrinkage in Euroloan syndications and in part&#13;
an effort to spread risks by transforming borrowing into securities.  During&#13;
1983-85 Arab banks have expanded their participation in the Eurobond market.&#13;
The prospects for further expansion in the Eurobond market will largely depend&#13;
on the present efforts of Arab banks to improve their management and technical&#13;
staff, as well as expand their connections and placement capabilities.  Their&#13;
natural market "niche" is with sovereign and corporate clients from developing&#13;
countries in general, and Arab countries in particular.&#13;
The relevant question is how can Arab bankLs expand their activities&#13;
in the Eurobond market after oil revenues have declined so seriously.   The&#13;
answer resides in their high capitalization by international standards.  The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
ratio of equity plus reserves to assets in most Arab banks exceeds 15 percent,&#13;
whereas it is only 3-7 percent for most international bank. 54/&#13;
It is this factor which will give Arab banks room for further growth of their&#13;
international operations despite the decline in oil revenues.&#13;
Prospects of Arab direct investments are mixed.   Within the Arab&#13;
region, intergovernment investments have performed unevenly.  Despite success&#13;
stories such as the Sumed pipeline, the Arab Mining Company, some Tunisian&#13;
investments, Jordanian joint ventures, and Egyptian real estate investments,&#13;
most  others  are  doing  poorly.    The  performance  of  Arab  financial  and&#13;
industrial investments in Egypt and Sudan, for example, has been severely&#13;
handicapped   by   the   bureaucracy,   inconsistent   macro   management,   and&#13;
restrictions  on banks and currency transfers.   In addition,  the dramatic&#13;
devaluations of national currencies in Egypt, Sudan, and Morocco have&#13;
adversely affected the profitability of Arab investments in terms of hard&#13;
currency. In North Yemen, the government considers international investments&#13;
another form of external assistance.   For all these reasons, most inter-Arab&#13;
investment institutions have had to reassess their operations in the last few&#13;
years. Their growth prospects for the near future are rather questionable.&#13;
By contrast, private direct investments have been growing steadily.&#13;
They are most likely to continue on this course, which has already started to&#13;
dominate Arab investment flows.  Most of this private capital comes from the&#13;
cumulative profits of the affluent years that have moved out of the Gulf&#13;
region in the wake of the recession, the Iran-Iraq war, and the Manakh&#13;
fallout. These movements have been initiated primarily by wealthy individuals&#13;
who either have empires of their own, or who have set up elite investment&#13;
clubs comprising a few families each. 55/  Future growth will therefore most&#13;
likely come from the less wealthy but more numerous individuals and families&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
throughout  the Gulf region.   Left to their own initiative,  those private&#13;
capital movements will tend to gravitate toward developing countries with&#13;
which investors have special family, ethnic, or cultural ties.  For the most&#13;
part,  managing  such investments  is a family affair.   Tapped into formal&#13;
institutions, the geographic allocation of private investments tends to follow&#13;
more objective criteria reminiscent of Kuwaiti investment banks in their&#13;
formative years. Typically, private direct investments in such cases are made&#13;
and monitored  by professional  managers.    Both  i-amily and  professionally&#13;
managed international private direct investments are likely to continue their&#13;
growth into the future.&#13;
Islamic banks, in addition to facing the risks and difficulties that&#13;
all banks must cope with to succeed, have the added challenge of figuring out&#13;
how to handle the question of interest and its compounding.   Much has been&#13;
accomplished in a short period: The domain of Islam;ic banking has been agreed&#13;
upon between sources of funds and users of funds; financial instruments have&#13;
been created and have produced reasonable results; and Islamic banks have been&#13;
accepted by the finance industry because they have expanded their market&#13;
without adversely affecting the markets of conventional banking. However, in&#13;
a world of growing financial interdependence, more aLnd more Islamic banks face&#13;
the challenge of having to conduct business with institutions whose very modus&#13;
operandi revolves around receiving and paying interest.&#13;
Until Islamic banks can create an alternative self-contained universe&#13;
of their own that would perpetually shield them from interaction with&#13;
conventional banks in interest-bearing transactions, their difficulties will&#13;
continue.  Their relatively small size makes that possibility rather remote.&#13;
However, it should also be recognized that the potential of Islamic banks to&#13;
mobilize funds from clients who strictly adhere to the principles of Islam is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
not minimal, and remains to be realized on a scale larger than has hitherto&#13;
been attempted.  Although the financial system in most Moslem countries does&#13;
not operate in the same way as Islamic banks do, Moslem communities throughout&#13;
the world--estimated to be in excess of 750 million--are becoming increasingly&#13;
interested in the notion of Islamic banks. To the extent that some sectors of&#13;
Moslem communities were not using the modern banking system because they did&#13;
not accept the notion of Riba, Islamic banks will be in a position to mobilize&#13;
the savings in such communities.   In the final analysis, Islamic banks will&#13;
most likely complement the services of conventional banks, but will not&#13;
provide an alternative.&#13;
The prospects for Arab centers of finance are also uncertain.   The&#13;
recent financial shakeout in both Kuwait and Bharain has diminished their&#13;
status as centers for exporting Arab capital.   In Kuwait, recently adopted&#13;
strict monetary discipline is forcing bank mergers, while in Bharain the&#13;
decline in capital flows is forcing the departure of some offshore banking&#13;
units.   When the crisis is over, banking institutions in the two countries&#13;
will have become more attuned to the fickle conditions of financial markets.&#13;
Their activities in developing countries will no doubt be based on more&#13;
methodical assessments of profitability.&#13;
With proper policy reforms, the relative position of Cairo may be&#13;
strengthened owing to the financial developments that have been unfolding in&#13;
Egypt  during  the  last  few years.   Among  other  factors,  the  substantial&#13;
remittances of Egyptian workers have caused changes both in local financial&#13;
institutions and in the philosophy of mananging such funds.56/  Contrary to&#13;
popular misconceptions, the size of the labor markets in the oil countries has&#13;
not declined since 1980, and there is increasing evidence, at least from Saudi&#13;
Arabia and Kuwait, that the expatriate workforce may not fall drastically in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
the next few years. If, as seems likely, workers' remittances do not decline&#13;
significantly, further changes may take place in Egypt's financial management&#13;
and, by implication, in its position as an emerging center of Arab finance.&#13;
Now that Arab financial institutions have established a presence in&#13;
international financial/development circles and have gained experience in&#13;
transferring substantial amounts of resources to developing countries, they&#13;
can expect other challenges in the future.  The greatest of these challenges&#13;
for some will be to survive the vagaries of the international financial&#13;
environment, which has changed significantly since the debt crisis broke out&#13;
in 1982, leaving financial intermediaries on shakier ground than ever before&#13;
and the economies of developing countries more vulnerable. At the same time,&#13;
the decline in oil revenues has diminished the natural advantage that many&#13;
Arab banks have relied upon to enter the international markets, namely their&#13;
ready access to exports of Arab capital.   Yet, accompanying such challenges&#13;
are opportunities for growth and consolidation.   These could be captured if&#13;
Arab banks tackled creatively the difficult but necessary tasks of building&#13;
their staff capabilities, expanding their investmenl: functions, and extending&#13;
their placement contacts. Unimaginative managers will face the most difficult&#13;
times ahead.&#13;

            The study begins by considering the
            deployment of the capital surplus so as to place the
            activities of Arab financial institutions in developing
            countries in the proper context. Most of these activities,
            whether official aid, commercial credits, or direct
            investments, seem to have been triggered by the capital
            surplus in a number of oil exporting countries during the
            1970s. The discussion then turns to the development of Arab
            financial institutions in the light of Kuwait's
            experience as the earliest capital surplus country. The
            mechanisms and institutions that Kuwait devised during the
            1950s and 1960s to manage its capital surplus help to
            explain the international activities of the financial
            institutions from other capital surplus countries during the
            1970s and 1980s. The study concludes by assessing future
            prospects of Arab financial institutions in developing
            countries in regard to Arab/OPEC aid, Islamic banks, and
            participation in syndicated loans, Eurobonds, and direct investments.
