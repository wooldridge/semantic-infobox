            The author argues that since competition
            is more effective than regulation in promoting efficiency,
            separating the potentially competitive parts of the industry
            from the natural monopoly parts that must remain regulated
            is good public policy. If this "de-integration" is
            possible, he says, it should be done, or at least the option
            should be kept open through continued public ownership of
            the transmission system. And on the question of
            privatization, he cites recent experience with power sector
            reform that suggests that efficiency depends more on the
            form of regulation than on the form of ownership.
