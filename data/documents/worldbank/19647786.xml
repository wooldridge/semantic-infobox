The Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Plan (PEG) established national                          periurban areas. This situation reasserts the need to establish&#13;
water and sanitation targets among the metas imperdonables                          universal water and sanitation goals.&#13;
(targets to be met without excuses). These national targets&#13;
envision achieving water supply coverage of 90 percent of the                       As figure 1 illustrates, the analysis conducted with the MAPAS&#13;
population in urban and rural areas and sanitation coverage of                      financial tool identified an estimated annual deficit of US$259&#13;
76 percent in urban areas by 2014.                                                  million to cover the investments (public and private) of USS440&#13;

The PEG did not propose a target for sanitation in rural areas.                     investment gap is US$194 million per year for sanitation and&#13;

    The scorecard evaluates the service delivery pathway through                 through the process of developing plans and sector activities,&#13;
    which the country transforms funding into sustainable services               and (3) the sustainability of the services provided.&#13;
    for water and sanitation in each of four subsectors: rural water,&#13;
    urban water, rural sanitation and hygiene, and urban sanitation              Each building block is scored from a minimum of 0 up to 3, depending&#13;

This initiative is promoted by the Central American and Dominican Republic Forum for Water and&#13;
Sanitation (FOCARD-APS) through its Regional Technical Group on Information System with the&#13;
support of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation program (WSP).&#13;
&#13;
In Panama, it has been implemented through the World Bankâ&#128;&#147;funded Water and Sanitation Project&#13;
(PASAP) by the Directorate of Drinking Water and Sewer Subsector (DISAPAS) of the Ministry of&#13;
Health within the framework of the Inter-Agency Commission on Drinking Water and Sewer (CIAPAS)&#13;

            Panama - Monitoring country progress in
            drinking water and sanitation (MAPAS)
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report presents the results of a
            sector analysis and dialogue carried out during the
            implementation of the Monitoring Country Progress in
            Drinking Water and Sanitation (MAPAS) regional initiative in
            Panama. While Panama has reached important milestones in WSS
            access levels, the rural and periurban areas remain largely
            unserved. The MAPAS analysis generated a scorecard which
            evaluates the service delivery pathway in four subsectors of
            water supply and sanitation (WSS): rural water, urban water,
            rural sanitation and hygiene, and urban sanitation and
            hygiene. The report lists priority actions suggested for
            each subsector. The results indicate that it is essential to
            continue with the process of a legal and institutional
            reform of Panama's WSS sector. The reform must
            facilitate the reorganization of the sector and the
            establishment of effective leadership to guide the
            development and application of sector policies. It should
            also seek to ease the preparation of plans based on equity
            criteria to direct investments that provide water services
            to the population with limited or no access at all. The
            reform process must also ensure autonomy for the service
            providers, along with effective regulation mechanisms, so
            they can take steps to recover costs and improve the quality
            and sustainability of services to the public. Likewise, it
            is critical to ensure the availability of the financial
            resources required for the rehabilitation and replacement of
            existing systems that are reaching the ends of their
            lifetimes. Finally, ensuring systematic compilation of
            information on sector financing, access, coverage, and
            quality of services is critical for sector planning and monitoring.
