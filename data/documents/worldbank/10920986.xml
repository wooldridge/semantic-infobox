(EDI), as reflected in some text)&#13;
&#13;
The Regulatory Reform and Private Enterprise Division of EDI (EDIRP), in partnership with the&#13;
Korea Development Bank, conducted a core course on Fundamentals of Risk Management&#13;
and Project Selection in Infrastructure Finance in Seoul, Korea, from May 25-29, 1998. The&#13;
objective of the course was to provide participants with knowledge and skills of how&#13;
infrastructure projects are analyzed, appraised, managed, and financed. The course provided&#13;
general concepts, analytical techniques and case studies of such key issues as project&#13;
selection, risk mitigation, contract design, environmental impact and risk assessment, and&#13;
international financing. Eighty-three participants attended this course, consisting of officials&#13;
from the Korean government ministries, and mid- to senior-level managers from commercial&#13;
banks and financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
The course was evaluated by the EDI Evaluation Unit (EDIES) using an end-of-course&#13;
questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by sixty-six respondents, 79.5 percent of&#13;
the total number of participants. Fifty-four of the respondents had less than 5 years of work&#13;
experience in infrastructure finance and/or development. Ten respondents had 5 to 10 years&#13;
experience and two had 11 to 15 years experience. The highest degrees obtained by the&#13;
respondents were either Certificates (3), Bachelors (39), MBAs (10), Masters other than&#13;
MBAs (7), Ph.D.s (2), Law (3), or others (2). Of the 66 respondents, there was only 1&#13;
woman. There were three sections in the questionnaire. The first section asked respondents&#13;
to rate the extent to which the course met its performance objectives. The second section&#13;
asked the level of respondents knowledge about topics covered in the course, before and&#13;
after completing the course. A 6-point Likert type scale that ranged from 1=minimum to&#13;
6=maximum was used to rate respondents rating for each question. Thirdly, respondents'&#13;
written comments about the course were content analyzed. Following is a summary of the&#13;
evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Among all course performance indicators, including course content and delivery, the&#13;
        quality of trainers received favorable ratings from all respondents. Respondents&#13;
        indicated that the trainers presented a variety of viewpoints, and communicated their&#13;
        messages well. The mean scores of these two indicators were among the highest&#13;
        performance ratings, 4.50 and 4.48, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Respondents from the private sector (N=50) felt that the course was a worthwhile use&#13;
        of their time, giving this indicator their highest course rating, 4.56. Results suggested&#13;
        that they particularly valued the availability of new information in the course&#13;
        (mean=4.50) and exposure to new concepts (mean=4.36) and suitable policies that&#13;
        they had not considered before (mean=4.20).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Respondents from the public sector (N=16) had the highest course rating on the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 quality of selected readings and materials (mean=4.50). They also indicated that the&#13;
 course focused on high priority issues (mean=4.25) and promoted productive&#13;
 interchange (mean=4.06).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe depth of course coverage received the lowest course performance rating among&#13;
 all respondents, a mean score of 3.86. Nine respondents stated in their comments&#13;
 that the course was too overloaded to digest all materials in five days. They&#13;
 suggested a simpler course, one designed with fewer topics covered in depth, or a&#13;
 longer session for the course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lPre/post knowledge assessment showed positive increases in the level of&#13;
 respondents' understanding of all key issues presented in the course. The mean&#13;
 scores were in the range of 3.02-3.56 before the course and the 4.23-4.83 range after&#13;
 the course. The largest knowledge gain among all respondents was on the issues of&#13;
 risk identification and allocation. This topic had one of the lowest pre-course mean&#13;
 scores, 3.17. The post-course mean score increased by 52.6 percent to the highest&#13;
 post-course rating, 4.83.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lAmong the private sector respondents, those who work in the financial, banking, or&#13;
 security markets (N=27) had the lowest knowledge gain in their ability to understand&#13;
 the role of contracting, while others who are engaged in the area of project&#13;
 development or construction (N=16) had the lowest gain in their ability to appreciate&#13;
 the problems faced by governments in involving private sector provisions. The&#13;
 percentage gains for the two groups on these topics were 24 and 20 percent,&#13;
 respectively. Course designers may need to focus more on these topics for the&#13;
 course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lTwo main suggestions for the course were made in respondents' written comments.&#13;
 First, the course should focus on case studies, using more practical examples&#13;
 relevant to Korea (N=12). Respondents felt that the discussions presented on contract&#13;
 design for transport infrastructure (N=10) and financing in bond markets (N=7)&#13;
 particularly lacked relevancy to their country and their jobs. Secondly, participants&#13;
 should be broken down into smaller and more homogeneous groups (N=7). This would&#13;
 allow participants to engage in the discussions effectively and learn from other&#13;
 participants with similar knowledge levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lA limitation to the evaluation is that pre/post self-assessment serves as an indicator&#13;
 of how much respondents felt they learned, but does not measure how much they&#13;
 actually learned. It would be useful to include indicators measuring changes in&#13;
 participants' knowledge and skills before and after the course.&#13;
