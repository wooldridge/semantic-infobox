CROATIA&#13;
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:          Republic of Croatia&#13;
Beneficiary:       Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications, and&#13;
Croatian Roads Authority (HC)&#13;
Amount:            US$80 Million equivalent&#13;
Terms:             17 years maturity including a grace period of 4 years at the Bank's&#13;
standard variable interest rate&#13;
Project Objectives:  The main objective of the project is to support and speed up the&#13;
modemization and transformation of the transport sector with special&#13;
emphasis on the main road network and Croatian Road Authority (HC).&#13;
In particular the project would: (a) assist GOC in its investment&#13;
program for the roads sector with the objective of reducing the&#13;
deterioration of the network and completing the construction of a few&#13;
well justified sections; (b) support the development of modem&#13;
management tools in HC; (c) improve the road safety situation; (d)&#13;
decrease road vehicle emissions; (e) maintain the present level of road&#13;
user charges; (f) support the restructuring of Croatian Railways (HZ)&#13;
leading to reduced budget transfers; and (g) contribute to the&#13;
elaboration of a master plan and associated investment plan for the port&#13;
of Rijeka.&#13;
Description:       (a) Policy and Institutions&#13;
The Government and HC will adopt policies and implement measures&#13;
to:&#13;
(i)    maintain the road vehicle fuel tax on at least its present level in&#13;
real terms;&#13;
(ii)   reduce the Governments's budgetary support to HZ;&#13;
(iii) design and implement a road traffic safety program;&#13;
(iv)  reduce lead content in vehicle emissions and ensure wide&#13;
availability of unleaded fuel at a price equal to or less than that&#13;
of leaded gasoline; and&#13;
(v)   continue the separation of civil works contractors from HC and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
pursue further implementation of the Pavement Management&#13;
System (PMS).&#13;
(b) Investments&#13;
(i)    a three-year time slice (1995-97) of HC's road expenditure&#13;
program directed at repairing war damage, reducing the&#13;
deterioration of the network and making investments to complete&#13;
projects that accommodate changes in transport demand;&#13;
(ii)  technical assistance and studies for:&#13;
*     HZ restructuring&#13;
*     traffic safety&#13;
*     implementation of PMS&#13;
*     Rijeka port master plan&#13;
(iii)  training for HC technical personnel in modernizing road&#13;
maintenance techniques, including pavement and bridge&#13;
management systems.&#13;
Benefits:          The project will: (i) reduce vehicle operating costs; (ii) reduce future&#13;
costly reconstruction by increasing road maintenance; (iii) reduce road&#13;
accidents and vehicle emissions; (iv) reduce Government subsidies to&#13;
HZ; and (v) contribute to HZ restructuring and development of Rijeka&#13;
port.&#13;
Risks:             The main project risks are that hostilities would resume, or that the&#13;
GOC would not have sufficient counterpart funds or recurrent budgets&#13;
to implement the project. Although serious tensions still exist in&#13;
Croatia and in the region, however, the situation is believed to be&#13;
sufficiently stable to begin an assistance program, with good chances of&#13;
success. The project has been limited to territories which are under the&#13;
Government's control, and even if hostilities should resume, it is&#13;
doubtful they would extend so far as to prevent project implementation.&#13;
In addition, the sector investment loan format, including annual reviews&#13;
of the Program, and the experience of the borrower, provide the&#13;
flexibility to adjust the size, location and composition of the Program&#13;
according to changing economic and political circumstances. Project&#13;
risks are considered to be acceptable given the exceptional conditions in&#13;
Croatia.&#13;

I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.1   After the war in late 1991, Croatia emerged with about one-third of its pre-war&#13;
territory outside its control, including about 25% of its agricultural land. These areas have&#13;
been designated as United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs) since January, 1992. Over the&#13;
last two years, after the war had ceased in Croatia, limited hostilities continued to take place&#13;
from time to time around these areas. However, the cease-fire of March 1994, reinforced by&#13;
the withdrawal of personnel and weapons, appears to be holding well. An agreement was&#13;
also reached (March 1994) between the republics of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina on a&#13;
federation within Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as a preliminary agreement on a confederal&#13;
arrangement between the two republics. The Government has persevered in its efforts at&#13;
economic reintegration within Croatia, and, with the assistance of international negotiators,&#13;
has succeeded in signing the second in a series of agreements to that end in December, 1994.&#13;
1.2   The war in Croatia severely disrupted the economy and cost thousands of lives, with&#13;
many more missing and wounded. Physical infrastructure and buildings suffered&#13;
considerable damage, estimated by the Govemment at about US$ 20 billion. For example,&#13;
virtually every major bridge along the Sava river was destroyed; houses, churches, schools&#13;
and hospitals were particularly hard hit; and looting and theft of machinery and equipment,&#13;
and the placing of land mines on agricultural land increased the level of destruction and&#13;
disruption. The war caused the displacement of some 350,000 people from within Croatia,&#13;
while more than 360,000 Bosnian refugees settled in Croatia. Although many families have&#13;
now retumed to their homes, the remaining displaced persons and refugees continue to&#13;
constitute a heavy financial burden for the Government.&#13;
1.3   Prior to the war, Croatia was, after Slovenia, the second richest republic of former&#13;
Yugoslavia with a per capita income of about US$3,350 equivalent. It enjoys a good&#13;
geographical location -- close to Italy and Hungary, a considerable potential for tourism&#13;
along the Adriatic coast, and a well-educated workforce. Croatia has a well-developed, open&#13;
economy, with manufacturing (electrical machinery, textiles, foodstuffs and chemicals)&#13;
accounting for about 30% of GDP, services for about 60%, and the total of imports and&#13;
exports for about 50% of GDP. The disruption of inter-republic trade resulting from the&#13;
break-up of former Yugoslavia, and the war impact on production and tourism activities&#13;
brought about a 25% drop in output, with per capita income falling to about US$2,500. The&#13;
most affected sectors were those which suffered either from the disruption of trade with&#13;
former Yugoslavia (e.g., shipbuilding, metalwork, and chemicals) or from the war-related&#13;
destruction and traffic disruption (tourism, construction, transportation). The decline in&#13;
production was accompanied by a significant reduction in the level of employment, by about&#13;
25 % over the whole period, and by the near-doubling of the unemployment rate, from about&#13;
9% at end-1990 to about 18% in early 1994. In addition, Croatia suffered from the loss of&#13;
all foreign exchange reserves that were kept by the National Bank of Yugoslavia, and is not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
expected to have ready access to foreign financing due to the outstanding dispute on the&#13;
allocation of part of former Yugoslavia's foreign debt.&#13;
1.4   In addition to the problems related to the war and the break-up of the former&#13;
Yugoslavia, Croatia also had to tackle simultaneously the problems of a transition economy.&#13;
Poorly run enterprises, which were formerly socially owned, accounted for the bulk of&#13;
industrial and agricultural output. Losses of the enterprise sector were some 7-8% of GDP&#13;
in 1993. Pressures on fiscal accounts, as well as the financing by the banking system of the&#13;
losses of the more inefficient public and formerly socially-owned enterprises, fuelled inflation&#13;
which reached an annual rate of over 1400% in 1993. Croatia has been addressing these&#13;
challenges courageously, in two distinct phases. During most of 1992 and 1993, it&#13;
endeavored to maintain its external competitiveness while trying to avoid falling into&#13;
hyperinflation. Building on initial success, the authorities launched a comprehensive&#13;
stabilization package in early October 1993 that has delivered impressive results so far.&#13;
After an initial surge due to the devaluation of the currency, inflation was curbed in one&#13;
month, and has remained slightly negative between November 1993 and June 1994 (minus&#13;
4% in cumulative) The negative real effects of the stabilization have been quite limited so&#13;
far: a moderate decline of industrial production in January-February 1994 was offset by&#13;
increases in April-May and GDP is projected to grown by 2-3% in 1994, after three&#13;
consecutive years of decline. The Croatian authorities are aware that, in spite of these early&#13;
successes, sustaining stabilization and resuming growth will now require more aggressive&#13;
measures in support of the systemic transformation of the economy, i.e., enterprise and bank&#13;
reform.&#13;
1.5   The Republic of Croatia became a member of the International Monetary Fund in&#13;
January and the World Bank in February 1993. It became a member of the European Bank&#13;
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in April, 1993. The Bank approved an&#13;
Emergency Reconstruction Project as its first operation in June 1994. The proposed project&#13;
provides an important input into the Government's reconstruction program, by assisting in&#13;
high priority reconstruction activities and institutional reforms in the transport sector which&#13;
are needed to restore the basic conditions for renewed economic growth. A loan in support&#13;
of the Government's enterprise and banking reform efforts is under preparation.&#13;
B. Transport System and Demand&#13;
1.6   Transport System: Croatia normally provides an important transport link between&#13;
Western and Southeastern Europe and on to the Middle East, but this has been disrupted by&#13;
the war. Croatia has three main transport corridors (see Map, IBRD No. 26152). The main&#13;
northwest-southeast corridor runs through the Sava river valley and is served by the Trans-&#13;
Yugoslav Highway (TYH) and the main trunk railway, both of which are currently blocked&#13;
since sections lie within areas not accessible to the Government. A second corridor, also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
served by main roads and the railway, links the main port of Rijeka and the Dalmatian Coast&#13;
with Zagreb and Hungary. This corridor has taken on increased importance due to the&#13;
blockage of parallel routes through Bosnia and the reorientation of central European traffic to&#13;
the West. The third corridor serves the 1,700 km Adriatic coast which is the center of&#13;
tourism.&#13;
1.7   The Croatian transport system, including what is now situated in the UNPAs&#13;
comprises: (a) a 27,000 km road network and around 700,000 domestic road vehicles&#13;
(discussed in Chapter II); (b) a 2,664 km railway network (described below); (c) the main&#13;
sea port of Rijeka, four secondary ports on the Adriatic, and numerous river ports on the 918&#13;
km of the Sava and Drava rivers which are navigable; (d) ocean-going vessels totaling 5.9&#13;
million dead-weight tons (dwt); (e) river boats, barges and tankers with a capacity of 90,000&#13;
dwt; and (f) seven international airports and an international airline.&#13;
1.8   Traffic: Croatia was more transport-intensive than Western Europe prior to&#13;
independence, although less so than other socialist countries in the region. Croatia generated&#13;
about 0.6 ton-kilometers (tkm) of freight transport per US$ of GDP in 1989, compared with&#13;
0.3 in France, 0.4 in West Germany, 0.5 in the Netherlands, 1.7 in Hungary and 2.1 in&#13;
Poland, at about the same time. Croatia, like other former socialist countries in the region,&#13;
is expected to become less transport intensive in the future, and to move an increasing&#13;
proportion of goods by road. This is because: (a) the manufactured goods and service&#13;
sectors, for which the speed and reliability offered by trucking is important, is likely to&#13;
grow; (b) competition from a deregulated trucking industry will increase; and (c) economic&#13;
activity will increasingly decentralize, which requires the door-to-door service which can&#13;
more easily be provided by road transport.&#13;

1.10   Freight traffic (measured in ton-kilometers, tkm) grew 3.6%  p.a. from  1960 to 1980,&#13;
and then declined slightly between 1980 and 1990 as Croatia began to restructure its&#13;
economy. Passenger traffic (measured in passenger-kilometers, pkm) grew by 5.4% p.a.&#13;
from 1960 to 1980, and then remained constant between 1980 and 1990. The rail share of&#13;
freight traffic, not including own-account or private road transport which are significant,&#13;
declined from 89% to 65%, and passenger traffic from 79% to 32%, between 1960 and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
1990. Traffic fell sharply and transport patterns were reoriented as a result of the war,&#13;
which began in mid-1991. Road traffic has fallen about 40% and rail traffic by more than&#13;
70% from their pre-war levels in 1990. The main northwest-southeast corridor, served by&#13;
the TYH and main trunk line railway, are presently blocked. East-west transit traffic has&#13;
increased, and concentrated on the Zagreb-Rijeka road and rail line due to the destruction of&#13;
bridges and subsequent closure of parallel routes through Bosnia and Herzegovina and the&#13;
UNPAs. Many ports have been damaged and traffic has decreased by about 75 %. Air&#13;
traffic was disrupted by the closure of airports and the withdrawal of Yugoslav Airlines.&#13;
C. Croatian Railways&#13;
1.11   Croatian Railways (HZ), as an entity in its present form, was founded when Croatia&#13;
became independent in 1991. The 2,664 km railway network includes 248 km which are&#13;
double track, and 910 km which are electrified, including 784 km connected to the&#13;
25kV/50 hz system and 126 km to the 3kV/DC system. The major part of the network and&#13;
stations are connected to a signalling system which functions well. At present 40% of the&#13;
system is operating normally, a further 25% is damaged but in operation and the remaining&#13;
35% is in areas not currently accessible by the Government. The traction system includes&#13;
315 diesel and 147 electric locomotives (56% are 20 years old or less), and 35 electric and&#13;
79 diesel multiple units. Rolling stock includes 13,418 wagons (74% are 25 years old or&#13;
less) and 824 passenger cars (72% are 25 years old or less). As a result of war damage and&#13;
lack of spare parts only 60% of traction equipment and 30% of wagons are presently&#13;
available for operations.&#13;
1.12   Railway traffic is not likely to recover to pre-war levels, even if all lines are&#13;
reopened, due to the restructuring of the economy, the permanent diversion of some transit&#13;
traffic, and the probable decrease of mining and heavy industry activity. The Government&#13;
budget supported HZ with $130 million in operating subsidies and capital grants in 1993.&#13;
Even with this support, HZ incurred a net decapitalization of about $15 million. Projected&#13;
operating subsidies and capital grants for 1994 of US$154 million amount to 1.6% of&#13;
Croatia's GDP, a level of support which does not appear sustainable. HZ needs to be&#13;
radically downsized and restructured to reduce its losses and enable it to survive in a market&#13;
economy without major Government support.&#13;
1.13   Following participation in the Railway Roundtable sponsored by the Bank in 1991,&#13;
the GOC and HZ have become increasingly cognizant of the likely size of future deficits.&#13;
The Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications (MMATC) and HZ have&#13;
taken some steps to address the railways' financial problems, including reducing railway staff&#13;
by 7,000 (25% of its staff), and reorganized its maintenance and manufacturing units into&#13;
separate enterprises. In 1993, the Government Office for Restructuring and Economics of&#13;
State-Owned Enterprises (GOR) was assigned responsibility for restructuring HZ in addition&#13;
to 9 other major state enterprises. In November 1993, GOR issued its report on HZ,&#13;
proposing that a restructuring should be undertaken in three phases:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
Phase I      Preparation of new legal framework.&#13;
Phase II     Increase in equity, privatization of subsidiaries, reduction in&#13;
workforce and reconstruction of war damaged infrastructure.&#13;
Phase III    Transformation of HZ into a joint stock company eventually&#13;
privatized with infrastructure remaining under state ownership.&#13;
The first phase was implemented in July 1994 with the enactment of the law on Croatia&#13;
Railways. Phase II is scheduled to commence in 1994 and take 10 years, with phase III&#13;
commencing in the year 2000. No details are presently available on Phases II and III. As&#13;
an interim measure to reduce the current level of subsidies for HZ, the Bank has obtained&#13;
agreement with the Government during negotiations regarding the maximum level of&#13;
government subsidies to HZ (para. 3.9).&#13;
D. Organization, Investments and Transport Policy&#13;
1.14   Organization The Yugoslav economy, including the transport sector, was organized&#13;
as a self-management system until shortly before Croatia's independence. Under this system,&#13;
economic decision-making was achieved through a consensus of managers, workers, and the&#13;
social-political community, primarily through intra- and inter-firm agreements on long-range&#13;
cooperation (self-management agreements). These agreements were enforced through a&#13;
complex system of laws and social checks and balances. This resulted in a "soft budget&#13;
constraint", where firms did not have sufficient incentive to reduce costs, and did not invest&#13;
efficiently.&#13;
1.15   Croatia has made good progress on enterprise restructuring. Clear state ownership&#13;
has been established for most enterprises, workers' councils have been eliminated, and a well&#13;
designed privatization program has begun. However, implementation has been slowed&#13;
because the GOC has to do too much simultaneously, i.e. address territorial issues, care for&#13;
refugees, take on tasks previously done by the former Yugoslavia, and implement market&#13;
reforms. The GOC initiated a comprehensive privatization and restructuring program with&#13;
the 1991 Act on Transformation of Social Enterprises. This Act provides for the eventual&#13;
privatization of social enterprises, including giving 30% of their value to certain categories of&#13;
citizens, although it did not cover all economic activities (e.g. the important banking sector).&#13;
The project includes actions to reduce the GOC's financial support for the railways, and a&#13;
study to support their restructuring. (para. 1.13).&#13;
1.16   Investments Prior to independence, most transport investments were made by the&#13;
social sector. Their level varied considerably because of the need to complete the basic&#13;
transport network in the 1960s and 1970s, ex-Yugoslavia's relatively easy access to credit in&#13;
the 1970s and early 1980s, an economic slowdown in the late 1980s, and the disruptions&#13;
caused by the war since 1990. At present, the situation is being consolidated and a medium&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
term investment planning framework is emerging. This process is rather advanced in the&#13;
roads subsector; the Croatian Roads Authority (HC) has a three year investment plan&#13;
(para 3.4) which the present project supports. For the railways the situation is much less&#13;
clear because of the overall unclear and unsettled financial situation (para 1.11-13). For the&#13;
aviation and ports subsectors, the attention up till now has been on repairing the most urgent&#13;
war damages. For the major port, Rijeka, the project includes a component aimed at&#13;
proposing an administrative/managerial structure and developing a master plan for its&#13;
development (para. 3.10(a)).&#13;
1.17   War Damage: It is difficult to estimate the extent of war damage in the transport&#13;
sector because most damage is in inaccessible areas. The 1995-97 road expenditure program&#13;
allocates about US$30 million for direct war damage repair and replacement. In addition, an&#13;
important part of the pavement resurfacing and rehabilitation component, which is the biggest&#13;
one in the program, is attributable to the destruction caused by the war. HZ has already&#13;
made temporary repairs to the railway, and estimates that it will need to spend an additional&#13;
US$32 million to repair damage in accessible territories. MMATC estimates it needs to&#13;
spend US$20-30 million to replace the most urgently needed air traffic control equipment; it&#13;
is proposed that this be financed by the EBRD. The Bank has lent US$128 million for an&#13;
Emergency Reconstruction Project, including US$12 million for roads and US$10 million for&#13;
railways.&#13;
1.18   Sector Strategy: Taking financial constraints and the need for institutional reforms&#13;
into account, the GOC and Bank have discussed the following strategy for the transport&#13;
sector during the next several years: (a) repair damaged transport infrastructure over a period&#13;
of about five years, including repairing the most important tourist airports; (b) defer most&#13;
purchases of railway rolling stock, or vehicles for road transport enterprises owned by GOC,&#13;
until traffic levels recover; (c) reduce the road maintenance backlog; (d) be highly selective&#13;
with other road investments due to the recent decline in traffic and fiscal constraints; (e)&#13;
reduce the railway subsidy and restructure HZ to reduce its losses and increase its&#13;
commercial orientation; and (f) privatize truck operators and separate road maintenance&#13;
contractors from HC. MMATC and Ministry of Finance (MOF) have agreed in principal&#13;
with these recommendations. In addition, for the ports, primarily Rijeka, there is a strong&#13;
awareness that installations have to be made more efficient and that an overall development&#13;
concept has to be formulated.&#13;
E. Previous Bank Projects&#13;
1. 19 Although the Bank's dialogue with Croatia started in early 1992, it did not&#13;
immediately translate into lending operations. Initially, our restraint was due to the&#13;
continuing limited hostilities within Croatia; the Bank continued to be cautious during 1993&#13;
and early 1994 because of the situation in the neighboring Republic of Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina. The major breakthroughs of March 1994 allowed the Bank to adopt a more&#13;
active cooperation stance. On June 22, 1994, the Board approved the first loan to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
Republic of Croatia (Emergency Reconstruction Loan, 3760-HR). In addition to the&#13;
Emergency Reconstruction Project, the Bank has made 12 loans for transport to the former&#13;
Yugoslavia totalling US$711.5 million equivalent (Annex 1) which contained components&#13;
benefiting Croatia. These included eight loans to the highway subsector, three loans for the&#13;
railway subsector, and one loan for an pipeline project.&#13;
1.20   The main emphasis in highway lending to Yugoslavia was on improvements to key&#13;
links in the primary road network. The First and Second (Highway) Projects which financed&#13;
the completion of the coastal section of the Adriatic Highway; and improvement of roads&#13;
connecting the Zagreb-Belgrade highway with the Adriatic highway, were completed within&#13;
the original cost estimates and agreed time schedules. The Completion Report for the Ninth&#13;
Highway Project indicated that it substantially achieved its objectives. The Completion&#13;
Report for the Eleventh Highway Project pointed out that it suffered delays in&#13;
implementation because of shortages of local funds due to a severe recession. The First and&#13;
Second Highway Sector Projects were based on a comprehensive sector lending approach,&#13;
including a deeper involvement in the important area of road maintenance. They proceeded&#13;
satisfactorily in Croatia. The former Yugoslavia and the Bank also prepared the Third&#13;
Highway Sector Project, including US$75.0 million for Croatia, which included follow-up&#13;
initiatives on road maintenance, financing and investment planning. This project was lapsed&#13;
prior to effectiveness following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.&#13;
1.21   The Project Performance Audit Report for the Fourth Railway Project (Loan 1026-&#13;
YU) noted that the project was successfully completed, albeit with some delays and local cost&#13;
overruns, that it was economically justified, and that it succeeded in making operational&#13;
improvements. This project, and its successors, also succeeded in introducing cost-benefit&#13;
analysis as the basis for investment selection. The railway projects were only partly&#13;
successful in improving railway financial performance because of an underlying difference&#13;
of view between the Government of the former Yugoslavia and the Bank about the function&#13;
of the railways (the Government of former Yugoslavia viewed the railways as serving&#13;
important non-commercial functions which required continued subsidization). The Bank also&#13;
prepared the Seventh Railway Project, including US$32.5 million for Croatia, which included&#13;
further initiatives in the areas of finance, coordination of investments, and the&#13;
computerization of rail operations. This project was also lapsed prior to effectiveness due to&#13;
the breakup of Yugoslavia. Project Completion Reports are under preparation for the First&#13;
and Second Highway Sector Projects as well as for the Sixth Railway Project.&#13;

II. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR&#13;
A. Road Network&#13;
2.1.  The Croatian public road network comprises about 26,732 km which are&#13;
administratively classified as main, regional or local roads (Table 2.1). Of these, 21,541 km&#13;
are paved and 5,191 km are gravel surfaced. The density of the road network is about 48&#13;
km per 100 square kilometers, compared to an average of about 77 km per 100 square&#13;
kilometers in Western Europe. Presently, about 5,600 km of roads are not under&#13;
Government control or accessible. Paved road standards vary from high quality four-lane&#13;
toll facilities with grade separated interchanges to narrow country lanes.  All classified roads&#13;
are administered by HC.&#13;

TOTAL    21,541    5,191     -    26,732    (21,132)&#13;
2.2.  The main road network carries around 75% of road traffic. The GOC desires to&#13;
rehabilitate and upgrade these roads to a level consistent with the network of countries in the&#13;
European Community. While the GOC would like to improve a number of roads, it gives&#13;
high priority to the Zagreb-Karlovac-Rijeka highway which is a part of the Trans-European&#13;
Highway network.&#13;
l/    Excludes urban and some 21,000 km of unclassified roads.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
B. Traffic&#13;
2.3.  The road vehicle fleet grew at a rapid 10.1%  p.a. from  1972 to 1980, and a modest&#13;
2.6% p.a. during the 1980s, to 896,800 vehicles in 1990 (Annex 2. 1). The passenger car&#13;
fleet totaled 795,400 units in 1990, or 182 passengers cars per 1,000 persons which is a&#13;
higher motorization rate than most Eastern European countries, but lower than Western&#13;
Europe. The number of passenger cars has thereafter fallen by close to 20%. The average&#13;
traffic levels on main roads were about 4,500 vehicles per day (vpd) in 1990, but fell to&#13;
about 3000 vpd in 1993, ranging from 1,800 vpd to 15,800 vpd. HC estimates that there&#13;
were about 4,000 km of roads with traffic levels exceeding 3,000 vpd, and that the average&#13;
traffic level on regional roads was about 1,600 vpd, ranging from about 500 vpd to over&#13;
7,000 vpd. Road traffic has fallen overall by around 30% since the beginning of the war in&#13;
mid-1991 but with some roads, e.g. Zagreb-Rijeka showing substantial increases, and traffic&#13;
patterns are re-oriented (para. 1. 10). Traffic has considerably decreased on the Adriatic&#13;
Highway, especially on its section leading from Zadar to Sibenik, owing to the war&#13;
circumstances, while the traffic on the roads running toward Bosnia and Herzegovina relates&#13;
only to humanitarian aid activities. The roads running through the UNPAs are still closed to&#13;
traffic. Traffic is expected to eventually recover to pre-war levels, but only over a period of&#13;
several years in parallel with the expected economic recovery.&#13;
2.4.  HC carries out regular detailed origin-destination traffic surveys on main roads, and&#13;
monitors traffic volumes on main and regional roads at 238 locations with automatic and&#13;
manual traffic counts. These provide detailed information on annual and hourly fluctuations&#13;
in traffic volumes. In normal years, there is a significant seasonal traffic variation due to&#13;
tourism, with traffic flows on roads along the Adriatic Coast increasing from 4,000 vpd in&#13;
the winter to 12,000 vpd during the summer.&#13;
C. Road Transport Industry&#13;
2.5.  There were three types of trucking in the former Yugoslavia, which partly remain in&#13;
Croatia: social sector enterprises, own-account trucking (mostly social sector), and private&#13;
sector operators. Public social sector firms specialized in long distance and international&#13;
traffic, competing with the railways. Own-account and private operators until recently&#13;
specialized in local transport. Trucking is increasingly the major freight transport mode,&#13;
with the private sector showing strong growth.&#13;
2.6.  The road freight industry was heavily regulated until about 1989, through various&#13;
laws which limited the participation of the private sector (e.g. barriers to entry, prohibitions&#13;
against international transport, more favorable tax rates and customs duties for social sector&#13;
firms). These formal regulations were reinforced by various Government agencies and&#13;
associations and informal arrangements which served to divide the market, and by accounting&#13;
and managerial practices which permitted social sector firms to operate inefficiently and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
sustain losses over the long term. However, the regulations were unevenly enforced, which&#13;
coupled with a relatively dynamic private sector, resulted in the private sector increasing its&#13;
share of the market (measured in tkm) from 13% in 1970 to 28% in 1988. The regulatory&#13;
framework also resulted in the inefficient growth of own account fleets, which accounted for&#13;
21% of the market at that time. Vehicle utilization was also inefficient, e.g., trucks were&#13;
estimated to average only 50,000 km in 1990:&#13;

Transport and Communications Bulletin&#13;
2.7.  The bus industry was organized in a similar way as trucking, and heavily regulated&#13;
prior to independence. Intercity buses carried 31.7 billion pkm in 1987 (about three times as&#13;
much as railways) with an average length of haul of 31 km (i.e., mostly suburban) at an 83%&#13;
load factor which is high. In 1990, 5,836 buses were registered, of which 2,477 participated&#13;
in public transportation. Private buses are now estimated to account for 10% of the fleet.&#13;
2.8. Internal trucking is now essentially deregulated, with vehicles only required to have&#13;
an annual technical inspection. International trucks and buses are subject to a system of&#13;
bilateral and multilateral permits which have been partially liberalized in recent years.&#13;
Croatia prohibits trucks or buses older than ten years to participate in international transport.&#13;
Intercity bus transport has been partly deregulated since independence, while urban bus&#13;
services remain regulated by the respective municipalities. Maximum intercity bus tariffs are&#13;
set by MMATC, which also limits the number of buses working in some intercity corridors.&#13;
2.9.  The main difficulties facing the road transport industry are: (a) implementing the&#13;
privatization program (para. 1.10); and (b) operators' lack of familiarity with operating as&#13;
commercial enterprises. Only one company (Casina-Trans, 2,000 employees) has been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
privatized to date. Privatization is difficult because the GOC valued vehicles and other assets&#13;
at their replacement cost less depreciation, whereas their earning potential is much less at&#13;
present due to the decline in traffic. The question of road transport privatization will be&#13;
addressed through the Bank's work in support of enterprise reform and privatization.&#13;
D. Highway Administration&#13;
2. 10. HC was established in 1991 as the successor of the Self Managing Community of&#13;
Interest for Roads. It is in charge of planning, constructing and maintaining all public&#13;
interurban roads in Croatia. Since July 1, 1994 most of HC financing resources come from&#13;
the Government's centralized budget. HC is governed by a managing board of nine&#13;
members, of which six are appointed by the Government and three are selected by HC. HC&#13;
is headed by a manager and his deputies, all appointed by the Government. The&#13;
Maintenance Department is the largest of the three departments in which HC is organized.&#13;
The Department is responsible for road maintenance with the actual work carried out by 17&#13;
district offices covering the entire road network. The other two departments deal with&#13;
planning and engineering, and administrative functions. The organization of HC is shown in&#13;
Chart 1.&#13;
2. 11. The previous road organization carried out not only road maintenance but also road&#13;
construction, employing about 5,050 workers. HC is in the process of separating road&#13;
construction activities by establishing Government-owned construction companies with the&#13;
objective of eventually privatizing them. So far, four construction companies have been&#13;
established and the remaining one is expected to be established in the near future. As a&#13;
result, HC's manpower and equipment have been reduced. Presently, HC employs about&#13;
3,750 persons, of which some 3,250 are in the Maintenance Department. HC's headquarters&#13;
in Zagreb is staffed with about 500 persons, mainly engineers and technicians and has a&#13;
management role focusing on policy, budget and technical issues. Furthermore, HC is&#13;
implementing its budget as much as possible through contracting; all new construction works&#13;
are contracted as well as most of the highway resurfacing and rehabilitation, and about 30%&#13;
of the routine maintenance activities.&#13;
E. Planning and Engineering&#13;
2.12. HC is responsible for planning and programming of the road network. The&#13;
institutional framework and procedures are generally adequate for formulating rational and&#13;
efficient road development plans. HC currently prepares annual and multi-annual road&#13;
expenditure programs for submission to MMATC and MOF. Feasibility, environmental and&#13;
detailed studies for road works are commissioned from local highway institutes and&#13;
consulting firms. Most of these organizations are connected to the major universities. The&#13;
quality of these studies has improved over the years, most recently with the preparation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
new feasibility study guidelines in connection with the lapsed Third Highway Sector Project.&#13;
Environmental studies and engineering design standards (Annex 2.2) generally follow&#13;
European norms, and are adequate. GOC intends to harmonize its vehicle standards with the&#13;
European Union, and to adopt an 11.5 ton axle load limit. Work on drafting the necessary&#13;
regulations as well as defining the administrative and technical implications is underway in&#13;
MMATC.&#13;
2.13. Further improvement in the utilization of HC's planning tools in its decision making&#13;
process is needed, particularly given the emphasis on highway rehabilitation, resurfacing and&#13;
maintenance and current budgetary constraints. To improve cost effective maintenance&#13;
planning, HC requires a "systems" approach by means of which reliable data are collected&#13;
periodically and evaluations are performed using a decision-making scheme that, among other&#13;
factors, considers road performance, user costs and budget constraints. HC would be&#13;
assisted under the project to improve the utilization of the Pavement Management System&#13;
(PMS), as discussed below (Para 2.22).&#13;
F. Financing and Expenditures&#13;
2.14. HC has derived its revenues primarily from a sales tax on road fuel, as well as other&#13;
taxes and charges on road users. In 1992, HC revenues came from the fuel tax, vehicle&#13;
registration fees, tolls, foreign vehicle taxes and other sources. Most of these revenues were&#13;
earmarked for HC, but Parliament set the level of the fuel tax and other road taxes at the&#13;
same time it approved the annual road expenditure program. De facto, this was equivalent to&#13;
an annual budgeting process. On July 1, 1994, the earmarking of the fuel tax for HC was&#13;
abolished and substituted by direct budget allocations.&#13;
2.15. Vehicle fuel price levels and structures are:&#13;

RETAIL PRICE                   0.73       52      0.59        51&#13;
The amount of fuel tax collected from road users is about two times higher than what is&#13;
required for a reasonable road expenditure program and can thus be considered to cover the&#13;
economic cost of road use. Agreement has been reached that Government will maintain at&#13;
least this level in real terms (para. 5. 1(b)).&#13;
2.16. The present level of road expenditure is acceptable given the severe budgetary&#13;
constraints which the GOC now faces (paras. 1.2, 1.4). The 1995-97 Road Expenditure&#13;
Program (para. 3.4-9) that the project supports, foresees average annual expenditures of&#13;
about $200 million with a strong increase foreseen for maintenance related items. Given the&#13;
possibility of economic developments, which might influence the Program, its size and&#13;
composition will be adjusted annually, in consultation with the Bank, to adopt to changing&#13;
circumstances, as discussed below.&#13;
G. Construction&#13;
2.17. Building and construction are an important industry in Croatia. In 1992, the industry&#13;
employed 76,200 persons distributed in about 1970 companies. Recently, the number of&#13;
newly established small private businesses has increased significantly due to the privatization&#13;
process. The output capacity of the industry is estimated at about US$3,000 million per&#13;
year, of which some 10% is taken by the highway sector. However, the industry is only&#13;
working at about 60% of its installed capacity because of the serious economic and financial&#13;
burdens resulting from the war and the transforming of the economy.&#13;
2.18. Road construction, reconstruction and improvement is normally executed by means of&#13;
unit-price contracts. In the past, under contracts financed by the Bank under international&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB), no foreign contractors have been successful in presenting the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
lowest responsive bid except in one case. This is due to the very competitive prices of the&#13;
local contractors. With the emphasis on rehabilitation and strengthening programs, and with&#13;
the intention of encouraging the smaller local contractors, local competitive bidding (LCB)&#13;
was introduced as an acceptable procurement procedure under the Second Highway Sector&#13;
Project, and will be continued under the proposed project. The quality of the construction&#13;
work, though generally good, could certainly be improved through more demanding&#13;
construction supervision and the use of more advanced equipment in some enterprises which&#13;
are presently equipped with worn-out mechanical plants.&#13;
H. Maintenance&#13;
2.19. HC's technical road maintenance' capability is considerable but the physical condition&#13;
of the road system is deteriorating and the backlog of highway rehabilitation and resurfacing&#13;
(HRR) is increasing, because of the lack of adequate funding, and more recently the&#13;
significant destruction and damage caused by the war. To improve planning of HRR and&#13;
routine maintenance, HC is stepping up the implementation of its Pavement Management&#13;
System (PMS). The proposed project, by supporting the 1995-97 Road Expenditure Program&#13;
(para. 3.4-9) and further developing and implementing the PMS (para. 2.22), would support&#13;
the Government effort of preserving the condition of the road system.&#13;
2.20. The condition of the road network and therefore the maintenance and rehabilitation&#13;
requirements can at present only be roughly estimated. In order to get an overview of the&#13;
situation and as part of the development of the PMS, HC conducted, in the spring of 1994, a&#13;
visual road condition survey on the major and regional roads. Local roads were not&#13;
surveyed but their condition is probably no better than that of regional roads. According to&#13;
the survey, 27% of the network is in poor condition, about 39% in fair condition, and 34%&#13;
in good condition. This distribution does not however take into account the importance of&#13;
the roads as measured by traffic density. Doing so would probably improve the estimate of&#13;
the road network condition.&#13;
2.21. Under some assumptions it can be estimated that about 2,600 km require&#13;
rehabilitation works and that some 3,000 km are affected by the accumulated backlog of&#13;
deferred resurfacing. It is thus likely that the maintenance problem is a serious one. If the&#13;
orders of magnitude indicated above prove to be correct, the maintenance problem will not&#13;
be resolved with the proposed project. There is even the possibility that the condition of the&#13;
network will continue to deteriorate. To remedy the situation will thus require sustained&#13;
efforts over a longer time than what one Bank project covers. However, to get a reliable&#13;
)&amp;/    The term maintenance includes regular routine, periodic and winter maintenance,&#13;
including pavement strengthening, and rehabilitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
assessment of the situation and an efficient planning tool, it is of central importance that the&#13;
development of the PMS be accorded high priority.&#13;
2.22. To improve efficiency of HRR and routine maintenance operations and preparation of&#13;
the budget, HC has agreed that cost-effective maintenance planning requires a PMS approach&#13;
by means of which reliable data are collected periodically and evaluations are performed&#13;
using a decision-making scheme that, among other factors considers road performance, user&#13;
cost and budget constraints. In this respect a series of actions is needed to continue the&#13;
development and implementation of PMS in Croatia (Annex 3.3). During negotiations HC&#13;
confirmed that PMS would be fully operational by 1997 and that starting 1998 the budget for&#13;
HRR and routine maintenance would be prepared and monitored through the systematic use&#13;
of PMS (para. 5. 1(m)).&#13;
2.23. The Govemment has taken several initiatives in recent years to improve maintenance.&#13;
HC is being reorganized, and only routine road maintenance operations will be carried out by&#13;
force account. HC also commissioned a pilot maintenance study which was completed by the&#13;
Construction Institute in 1989. The Study had two main findings: (a) the current method of&#13;
rating pavement condition was inconsistent and technically inadequate for use in a PMS; and&#13;
(b) the road rehabilitation backlog was substantial and growing. Using HDM III, the study&#13;
demonstrated the advantages of using economic analysis to plan periodic maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation, and concluded that such works typically yield economic rates of return (ERRs)&#13;
in excess of 50%. Based on these findings, HC decided to proceed with the full-scale&#13;
implementation of a PMS in Croatia. Technical assistance would be provided under the&#13;
project to assist HC with its reorganization, including separating civil works contractors, and&#13;
in further implementing the PMS. HC agreed at negotiations to carry out an action plan&#13;
covering the reorganization and improvement of its maintenance operations, including the&#13;
separation of civil works contractors (para. 5. 1(c)).&#13;
I. Human Resources&#13;
2.24. The education, capability and experience of HC staff is high, although motivation&#13;
appears to have declined due to low salary levels resulting from inflation. HC staff is highly&#13;
qualified and experienced, with technical diplomas required for road foremen and engineering&#13;
degrees for higher level staff. At the regional and local level, training sessions take place on&#13;
the organization and techniques of road maintenance. The primary training needs, which&#13;
would be assisted under the project, are those relating to adopting computer-based systems,&#13;
modem management practices, and the latest highway maintenance techniques.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

J. Traffic Safety&#13;
2.25. Road traffic accidents have become a serious problem in recent years. In 1991, there&#13;
were 14,471 accidents, injuring 19,791 persons and causing 1,020 deaths. The number of&#13;
fatalities is three to six times higher than in Western European countries:&#13;

2.26. The government views the high accident rate with deep concern, and has taken steps&#13;
to reduce the number of accidents. These include road improvements, as well as signalling&#13;
and marking, construction of bypasses around towns and villages, more rigorous vehicle&#13;
inspection, stricter enforcement of traffic laws, improving driver education, and public&#13;
awareness campaigns. Croatian traffic safety laws are in line with international standards.&#13;
Presently, traffic safety is under the responsibility of four Ministries (MMATC, Internal&#13;
Affairs, Education and Health) and the Croatia Committee for Traffic Safety. The GOC&#13;
recognizes that more needs to be done to reduce the accident rate.&#13;
2.27. There is a large number of administrative entities involved in road safety in Croatia&#13;
today and a significant amount of road safety work is already being undertaken. A National&#13;
Road Safety Council exists and it has elaborated a road safety plan. This is a reasonable&#13;
plan which provides a sound basis for improvement of the traffic safety situation. There are,&#13;
however, elements in the plan which need further review and/or elaboration and the project&#13;
therefore includes technical assistance for such a review (Annex 3.7). During negotiations&#13;
agreements were reached that the proposed traffic safety review be carried out and that&#13;
consultations with the Bank be held before December 31, 1995 about the implementation of&#13;
the study recommendations (para. 5.1(d)).&#13;

m. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
3.1. The main objective of the project is to support and speed up the modernization and&#13;
transformation of the transport sector with special emphasis on the main road network and&#13;
HC. In particular the project would: (a) assist GOC in its investment program for the roads&#13;
sector with the objective of addressing the road maintenance situation and completing the&#13;
construction of a few well justified sections; (b) support the development of modem&#13;
management tools in HC; (c) improve the road safety situation; (d) decrease road vehicle&#13;
emissions; (e) maintain or increase the present level of road user charges; (f) support the&#13;
restructuring of HZ leading to reduced budget transfers; and (g) contribute to the elaboration&#13;
of a master plan and associated investment plan for the port of Rijeka. To achieve these&#13;
objectives, GOC and HC will develop and implement policies covering:&#13;
(i)    maintenance of fuel taxes and charges at least at their present levels in&#13;
real terms (para. 2.15);&#13;
(ii)  reduction of Government's budgetary support to HZ (para.1.11-13 and&#13;
3.9);&#13;
(iii) design and implementation of a road traffic safety program (para.&#13;
2.27);&#13;
(iv)  reduction of lead content in vehicle emissions and availability of&#13;
unleaded fuel (para. 3.32); and&#13;
(v)   HC action plan, including continued separation of civil works&#13;
contractors and further implementation of the PMS (paras. 2.22, 2.23).&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.2.  The project components are summarized below and described in more detail in the&#13;
following paragraphs.&#13;
(i)    a three-year time slice (1995-97) of Croatia's HC road expenditure&#13;
program directed at repairing war damage, increasing HRR and routine&#13;
maintenance and completing projects that accommodate changes in&#13;
transport demand;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
(ii)   a total of 110 mm of TA and studies distributed as follows:&#13;
*     HZ restructuring study, 30 mm&#13;
*     traffic safety, 20 mm&#13;
*     implementation of PMS, 30 mm&#13;
*     port study, 30 mm&#13;
(iii)  training for HC technical personnel in modernizing road maintenance&#13;
techniques, including pavement and bridge management systems.&#13;
The Road Expenditure Program&#13;
3.3.  The aggregate three-year (1995-1997) Road Expenditure Program of Croatia (the&#13;
Program) is estimated to cost $566 million including contingencies and administration but&#13;
excluding the debt service. Including the debt service, the total figure amounts to US$638&#13;
million. The Program is summarized in Table 3.1 below, with the details shown in Annex&#13;
3. 1. The Program, as well as necessary budgetary resources for its execution, were agreed&#13;
on during negotiations (para. 5.1(h)).&#13;

3.4.  The 1995-97 Program has been drawn up in consultation with the Bank, and is a&#13;
reasonable basis for the project. It represents a sizeable increase in HC's budget, being on&#13;
average about 40% higher per year for the 1995-97 period than for the 1991-94 period. The&#13;
balance of the program and its structure are reasonable and prudent as shown in the&#13;
distribution given below. The program indicates a substantial shift toward HRR and highway&#13;
maintenance as ongoing commitments for new construction will be completed. Maintenance&#13;
expenditures will increase by close to 90% per year for the program period as compared to&#13;
the previous four years.&#13;

3.5.  Provided economic viability is confirmed, the Bank could support any construction,&#13;
betterment or HRR component included in the Program. HC has tentatively identified the&#13;
components for Bank and other foreign financing, as shown in Annex 3.1. Components and&#13;
levels of expenditure for 1996 and 1997 are tentative at this stage. The program will be&#13;
reviewed annually with the Bank. This provides the flexibility to adjust: (a) the volume of&#13;
expenditures annually according to economic circumstances; and (b) the composition of the&#13;
Program if priorities change, e.g. if the issue of occupied territories is resolved. During&#13;
negotiations, the GOC provided assurances that not later than October 15 of each year, it&#13;
would furnish to the Bank a report on the progress achieved in carrying out the Road&#13;
Expenditure and Financing Program and proposed revisions to the Program for the period&#13;
through 1997; afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposal; and&#13;
thereafter introduce any revisions so that the Program is satisfactory to the Bank (para.&#13;
5.1(f)). Also, during negotiations, the GOC agreed: (a) to carry out feasibility studies of&#13;
roadwork investments proposed to be included in the Road Expenditure Program in&#13;
accordance with methods of economic analysis satisfactory to the Bank (Annex 3.2); and (b)&#13;
to undertake road expenditures greater than $5.0 million during 1995-97 only if their&#13;
estimated economic rate of return (ERR) is greater than 12 % (para. 5. 1(g)).&#13;
3.6.  The Program includes $152 million, about 24% of the Program, for the capacity&#13;
investments category. Practically all of this is allocated to complete projects which have&#13;
been delayed due to the lack of funds. This category decreases rapidly with less than 20%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
left for 1997. There are four items in this category. The first item is the completion of&#13;
construction of trunk roads including about US$71.6 million for the Ostravica-Delnice section&#13;
of the Zagreb-Rijeka road, where traffic has concentrated due to the closure of other roads&#13;
through Bosnia and Herzegovina and the territories. It is now the only road available from&#13;
the capital Zagreb to the port of Rijeka, and with one alternative over part of its length, the&#13;
only road between the main part of Croatia and Dalmatia. Two other major ongoing projects&#13;
are the Split by-pass and the Solin-Klis road, with an estimated total completion cost of about&#13;
US$40 million. The other items consist of the completion of ongoing minor projects, the&#13;
repair of war damages and a betterment and black-spot program. This is a modest&#13;
investment program given the changes in transport demand which need to be accommodated,&#13;
but is appropriate under the severe budgetary constraints which Croatia now faces. It is&#13;
envisaged that the proposed Bank loan would help finance the highway equipment (for&#13;
signalling, tunnel ventilation and other miscellaneous equipment) for the three mentioned&#13;
major ongoing projects as well as a contract to construct one km of highway and the&#13;
pavement of the 9 km of the Solin-Klis road. Also, it is envisaged that EBRD would&#13;
partially finance the completion of works of the Ostrovica-Delnice road as well as the&#13;
betterment program.&#13;
3.7.  The maintenance and war repair category accounts for 49% of the Program or&#13;
US$310 million. The routine maintenance allocation is adequate. HRR accounts for an&#13;
important share of this category, US$173 million or about 55%. However, the HRR&#13;
allocation is insufficient to remove the backlog of maintenance in the short run. If the&#13;
preliminary estimates referred to (paras. 2.20-21) are correct, the backlog of deferred&#13;
maintenance might be around $270 million, requiring about $55 million a year over a five-&#13;
year period to be eliminated. As the foreseen maintenance expenditures roughly correspond&#13;
to the estimated requirements, there would not be sufficient funds to reduce the backlog and&#13;
hence a higher HC budget might be warranted. However, taking into account: (a) the&#13;
uncertainty of present estimates of maintenance needs and backlog; and (b) the very&#13;
substantial increase in HC's budget, particularly for maintenance, that the Program provides&#13;
for, the planned maintenance expenditures are considered reasonable. The Loan would&#13;
finance a portion of the HRR program. The project also supports the completion of&#13;
implementation of the PMS which would be operational by 1997 and should provide the basis&#13;
for making better HRR and maintenance decisions. It is envisaged that starting 1998 the&#13;
annual HRR and maintenance program will be prepared on the basis of a Pavement&#13;
Management System, supported under the project. In the meantime, the selection of&#13;
individual road sections to be included under the program would be made using a simple&#13;
system based on reported road conditions and traffic as well as local cost and remedial&#13;
measures obtained from engineering experience (Annex 3.3). During negotiations the GOC&#13;
confirmed that the above maintenance and HRR program will be carried out and that HC will&#13;
make PMS operational by 1997 and that the 1998 budget for HRR and maintenance will be&#13;
prepared and monitored through the systematic use of PMS (para. 5.1(m)).&#13;

3.8.  HC administrative costs including salaries of headquarters personnel, consultants for&#13;
technical services and purchasing of highway maintenance equipment and parts are about&#13;
10% of the program. The 10% share of these items in the program is considered a normal&#13;
and adequate level of expenditures. These costs include expenditures of about US$6 million&#13;
for equipment, technical assistance and training required for the installation of the PMS&#13;
supported by the project (Annex 3.3). They also include about US$20.7 million for&#13;
acquisition of highway maintenance equipment of which some US$11.7 million equivalent is&#13;
provided under the Emergency Reconstruction Project (Report No P6360-HR) and a portion&#13;
of the remaining US$9 million would be financed by the proposed Loan. Annex 3.4 presents&#13;
a tentative list of equipment to be financed under the proposed project.&#13;
Croatian Railways&#13;
3.9.  As described in Chapter 1 (paras. 1.11-13), the financial situation of HZ is&#13;
unsustainable. Therefore, during negotiations the Bank reached agreement with Government&#13;
about the maximum level of subsidies to HZ not to surpass:&#13;
a)    1995 - US$105.0 million plus debt service&#13;
b)    1996 - US$ 90.0 million plus debt service&#13;
c)    1997 - US$ 75.0 million plus debt service&#13;
As the Government is meeting the debt service on HZ loans, any additional borrowing by&#13;
HZ will, for the purposes of this agreement, be counted as part of Government subsidy. In&#13;
addition, HZ will be required to maintain the level of payables, in real terms, including debts&#13;
to the social welfare fund and suppliers, at not greater than the level of June 30, 1994&#13;
(para. 5.1(a)). Based on projected debt service levels the annual cost to Government for&#13;
support to HZ would be as follows:&#13;
a)    1995  - US$150.0 million&#13;
b)    1996  - US$120.0 million&#13;
c)    1997  - US$ 90.0 million&#13;
To achieve these targets while ensuring that HZ will have sufficient cash flow to meet&#13;
operating needs will require a major effort on the part of the Government and HZ. The&#13;
Government will have to authorize reduction in current service levels in line with the reduced&#13;
demand, increase tariffs etc., and HZ will have to improve efficiency. To assist in&#13;
developing an appropriate short-term strategy for the purpose, the Bank proposes to provide&#13;
financing under the proposed loan for technical assistance as outlined in the draft terms of&#13;
reference in Annex 3.6.&#13;
Studies for the Rijeka Port and Road Safety&#13;
3. 10. The project also provides for two additional studies:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
(a)   The Rijeka Port Study would draw up a master plan and associated investment&#13;
plan and would propose an administrative/managerial structure for the port&#13;
including its relationships to the national and local governments as well as to&#13;
the private sector. The study would be based on the work already carried out&#13;
by French consultants. The Terms of Reference, a draft of which is included&#13;
in Annex 3.5, were agreed upon before negotiations. The cost of this study is&#13;
estimated at about US$600,000.&#13;
(b)   Road Safety. Although the Croatian services related to road safety are&#13;
relatively well organized there are some elements of the system, not&#13;
immediately obvious, which are restricting the effectiveness of the current&#13;
arrangements. To identify those elements and outline potential remedial&#13;
measures a review of an existing road safety plan (para. 2.27) Local&#13;
Competitive Bidding would be carried out under the project. This, plus&#13;
possible follow-up TA, would have an estimated cost of about US$400,000.&#13;
Draft Terms of Reference are in Annex 3.7.&#13;
C. Project Cost&#13;
3. 11. The total project cost is estimated at about US$568 million equivalent with a foreign&#13;
exchange component of US$238 million, based on 1994 prices and including physical and&#13;
price contingencies (Annex 3.8). Identifiable taxes and duties are about US$85 million and&#13;
the total project cost, net of taxes, is US$483 million equivalent. The cost estimates for the&#13;
civil works under the Road Expenditure Program are based upon reported local costs and&#13;
engineering experience, and are similar to those obtained in recent contracts. The costs of&#13;
equipment and technical assistance are estimated on the basis of recent experience.&#13;
D. Project Financing Plan&#13;
3.12. The Borrower will be the Republic of Croatia. The proposed loan of $80 million&#13;
equivalent would finance 34% of the foreign exchange cost or about 14% of the total cost of&#13;
the project. Another 8% of project cost, or about US$47.5 million equivalent, is expected to&#13;
be financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The&#13;
remaining US$441 million equivalent would be financed by the Government. This would&#13;
necessitate HC budgets of about US$190 million p.a. excluding the debt service.&#13;
3.13. In accordance with the above, the Project cost and financing plan is as follows:&#13;

Total Financing                330.11        237.70        567.81&#13;
Retroactive Financing: A maximum amount of US$8.0 million (10% of the loan amount)&#13;
would be eligible for retroactive financing of expenditures incurred after December 31, 1994.&#13;
The reasons for including retroactive financing in the project are: (a) the project covers three&#13;
construction seasons, the first being 1995 and unless procurement is undertaken early 1995,&#13;
thus could delay the start-up of the project; and (b) the project is cofinanced by EBRD and&#13;
an important consideration has been to keep the implementation schedules of both IBRD and&#13;
EBRD more or less parallel, since both institutions are financing different parts of the&#13;
Ostravica-Delnice road.&#13;

E. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
3.14. All necessary studies for construction of the Ostravica-Delnice section of the&#13;
Karlovac-Rijeka highway, for the Split by-pass, and for the Solin-Klis road are completed.&#13;
Feasibility studies for the betterment of 235 km and pavement strengthening of about 1,000&#13;
km are done based on HDM III. However, given the fact that Croatian conditions are not&#13;
always suitable for HDM III, a simpler model for analysis of HRR is proposed in Annex 3.3&#13;
while Annex 3.9 shows the grouping of HRR works for 1995. Supervision of construction&#13;
would be carried out by HC professional engineers assisted by consultants as needed.&#13;
HC has completed detailed engineering and draft bidding documents for items related to the&#13;
trunk highways included in the 1995 Program.&#13;
F. Implementation and Monitoring&#13;
3.15. Specific sub-projects will be prepared on a continuous basis in time for inclusion in&#13;
the annual programs. Preliminary updated investment and financing plans would be made&#13;
available to the Bank, so that the Program for the following year can be firmed up by the&#13;
end of October of each year during project implementation. During negotiations, assurances&#13;
were obtained that prior to bidding the Borrower will submit and agree with the Bank on the&#13;
following year's program and adhere to the criteria of project selection (paras. 3.6 and&#13;
5. 1 (f)).&#13;
3.16. HC will be responsible for execution and management of the project, except for the&#13;
technical assistance to the railways, for road safety as well as the port study which would be&#13;
the responsibility of MMATC. The Implementation Schedule for project activities is shown&#13;
in Annex 3. 11. The project is expected to start in the first quarter of 1995 and to be&#13;
completed by June 2000. The Implementation Schedule would be updated during the annual&#13;
review. HC will be responsible for monitoring and reporting on project implementation.&#13;
Monitoring indicators for project activities are given in Annex 3. 10. The above&#13;
arrangements were agreed during negotiations (para. 5.1(j)).&#13;
G. Project Procurement Arrangements&#13;
3.17. Procurement of goods and works will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Procurement Guidelines. To the extent practicable, items to be procured under the project&#13;
will be grouped into major packages to encourage competitive bidding, permit bulk&#13;
procurement, and to ensure standardization. Under the project, the proposed methods of&#13;
procurement would include International Competitive Bidding (ICB); Limited International&#13;
Bidding (LIB); Local Competitive Bidding (LCB); and Direct Contracting (DC). The&#13;
proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
3.18. International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Procurement packages for civil works&#13;
exceeding the equivalent of US$2 million per contract would be procured through ICB except&#13;
if a bidding group contains a road section, the cost of which is estimated to exceed US$1&#13;
million, in which case that group would be bid under ICB procedures, even if the estimated&#13;
cost of the group is less than US$2 million. It is estimated that the equivalent of at least&#13;
US$10.3 million for at least 2 ICB packages would finance civil works.' All ICB packages&#13;
for civil works will be prequalified. Procurement packages for goods and materials&#13;
exceeding the equivalent of US$300,000 per package, US$24.99 million for 8 packages,&#13;
would also be procured through ICB. In the case of procurement of goods through ICB,&#13;
eligible domestic firms would be provided a preference margin equal to 15% or the&#13;
prevailing duty, whichever is lower, in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
3.19. Limited International Bidding (LIB). Equipment for bridge maintenance, traffic&#13;
counting, weighing scales and road monitoring as well as the services for monitoring&#13;
pavement behavior, which are of very specialized nature and are supplied by a limited&#13;
number of suppliers, will be procured following LIB procedures in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines. It is estimated that the above mentioned equipment and services will be&#13;
procured in approximately 5 LIB packages at an aggregate cost of about US$2.0 million.&#13;
3.20. Local Competitive Bidding (LCB). Civil works for HRR are dispersed, are of small&#13;
value (the equivalent of less that US$2 million per contract), and in which foreign bidders&#13;
are unlikely to be interested because of their limited sizes and often remote locations and&#13;
because of the existence in Croatia of competitive and strong civil works contractors, would&#13;
be procured through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures. It is expected that the&#13;
loan proceeds would be used to finance about 30 LCB contracts, ranging from US$ 1 million&#13;
to US$ 2 million at a total estimated cost of US$67 million equivalent. To facilitate contract&#13;
administration, the Bank would only finance civil works contracts with a cost greater than&#13;
US$1.0 million.&#13;
3.21. Direct Contracting. Spare parts for existing research equipment which the Bank&#13;
agrees can be procured only from the original suppliers would be procured through direct&#13;
contracting at an estimated cost of US$35,000.&#13;
3.22. Procurement Review and Use of Standard Bidding Documents. The Bank would&#13;
conduct a prior review of procurement documentation, including prequalification of&#13;
contractors, for all ICB packages in accordance with paras. 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 of the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines. Prior approval will also be sought for the use of the LIB procurement&#13;
method. The Bank would also conduct prior review of bid documents for all LCB contracts.&#13;
The use of Bank's Bidding Documents for Goods and Civil Works (ICB) is mandatory, and it&#13;
1/ As annual programs are defined, part of the LCB contracts will be changed into ICB if&#13;
they contain road sections valued to more than US$1 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
is recommended for Civil Works (LCB) to facilitate preparation and review. These&#13;
documents were made available to the Borrower during negotiations. The project includes&#13;
technical assistance and training at an estimated total cost of US$3.20 equivalent. The&#13;
selection and employment of consultants would be done in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants, dated August 1981. All documents related to&#13;
procurement of consulting services would be subject to prior review and approval by the&#13;
Bank. A public procurement law in Croatia is under preparation. Therefore, a Country&#13;
Procurement Assessment would be scheduled only after the law has become operational and&#13;
its implementation is well underway. However, preparation of a Country Procurement&#13;
Strategy is planned for the current fiscal year. Meanwhile, for the procurement to be&#13;
financed with its own resources, the Borrower will follow procedures consistent with the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines. The Project Implementation Plan includes the schedule of major&#13;
procurement steps (Annex 3. 11).&#13;
3.23. Implementation arrangements. HC will be responsible for procurement under the&#13;
project. It has acquired substantial experience in procurement of works, goods and services&#13;
through previous experience with Bank projects in former Yugoslavia. It is familiar with&#13;
ICB, LIB, LCB and Direct Contracting.&#13;
3.24. Procurement information provided to the Bank would include: (a) prompt reporting&#13;
of contract award information; and (b) comprehensive explanation of revised cost estimates&#13;
for individual contracts and the total project, revised timing of procurement actions, and&#13;
compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement. During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached with the Government on all procurement arrangements&#13;
(para. 5.1 (k)).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
H. Disbursements&#13;
3.25. The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against the project components as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)   Civil Works: 60 % of expenditures for new construction, road betterment and&#13;
pavement strengthening;&#13;
(b)   Goods: 100% of foreign expenditures; 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory&#13;
cost) and 60% of expenditures for other items procured locally; and&#13;
(c)   Training and Technical Assistance: 100% of expenditure excluding taxes.&#13;
3.26. Disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditure (SOE) for eligible&#13;
expenditures under civil works and equipment supply contracts valued at $1.5 million and&#13;
$300,000 equivalent or less respectively. Supporting documentation would be retained by the&#13;
borrower and made available for the required audit as well as for Bank supervision missions.&#13;
The annual audits of project accounts would include a separate opinion on the disbursements&#13;
made under the SOE procedure. All other disbursements would be made against full&#13;
documentation submitted to the Bank.&#13;
3.27. To facilitate disbursements, the Bank's share of the project would be financed through&#13;
a Special Account (revolving fund) which would be opened by the Borrower in a bank&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. The authorized allocation for the Special Account would be $5.0&#13;
million, equivalent to about four months of the Bank's share of estimated project&#13;
expenditures during the four-and-one-half year disbursement period for the project. Funds&#13;
for goods would be withdrawn by the Borrower from the Special Account after approval of&#13;
the ICB or international shopping procedures and related contract awards by the Bank.&#13;
Replenishment for technical assistance and for consultants services would be made on the&#13;
basis of appropriate documentation. Replenishment of the Special Account would follow&#13;
Bank procedures. The Special Account would be audited annually by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would be submitted to the Bank for review and&#13;
approval within six months of the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
3.28. The disbursement forecast, based on the Project Implementation Schedule, is given in&#13;
Annex 3.12. Croatia being a new IBRD member country, there are no disbursement profiles&#13;
available. Croatia was a republic of the former Yugoslavia and therefore, the disbursement&#13;
forecast is based on the disbursement profile for transportation projects in the former&#13;
Yugoslavia. The project is expected to be presented to the Bank's Board of Directors in the&#13;
first quarter of 1995, and to be completed by June 2000, and to be fully disbursed six&#13;
months later or by December 2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
I. Accounting and Auditing&#13;
3.29. HC maintains a satisfactory accrual accounting system. The annual accounts,&#13;
including the SOEs as well as the special account would be audited each year by auditor(s)&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. The accounts and the auditor's report thereon would be received in&#13;
the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year. The arrangements for accounting&#13;
and auditing were agreed at negotiations (para. 5.1(j)).&#13;
J. Environmental Considerations&#13;
3.30. Croatia introduced Environmental Assessment requirements for Highways and High&#13;
Speed Roads in 1984 and this formed the basis for granting of location and building permits&#13;
in the Highway Sector. More recently, Croatia has passed laws requiring detailed environ-&#13;
mental impact assessments for any new highway constructions. The assessment must address:&#13;
(i) land acquisition and resettlement issues (ii) protection of air, land and water resources,&#13;
historical and cultural monuments (iii) mitigation of noise pollution (iv) management and&#13;
disposal of construction waste.&#13;
3.31. The new construction components, i.e. the Ostravica-Delnice section, the Solin-Klis&#13;
road and the Split Bypass involve major new highway construction. They have therefore&#13;
been categorized as "A" projects warranting full environmental impact assessments. Major&#13;
environmental issues anticipated in these locations include water pollution due to carriageway&#13;
runoff, land acquisition and resettlement, protection of historical monuments and noise pol-&#13;
lution due to proximity to urban areas. Environmental Impact Assessments have been pre-&#13;
pared by HC for these components. They have been reviewed by the Bank and found to be&#13;
satisfactory in the analysis of the environmental issues and in the recommended measures to&#13;
mitigate the impact. The recommendations have been taken into account in the design and&#13;
construction of these works. Summaries of the Environmental Impact Studies have been&#13;
distributed to the Board.&#13;
3.32. In regards to air pollution due to traffic, Croatia is in the process of preparing legisla-&#13;
tion on regulating air pollution, specially targeting traffic pollution. The legislation is expect-&#13;
ed to be passed during 1994. The state owned oil company (INA) is committed in bringing&#13;
down lead and sulfur contents its gasoline. INA expects lead levels in gasoline to be reduced&#13;
to 0.15% by weight within the next two years. All new stations commissioned sell unleaded&#13;
gasoline and leaded gasoline will be phased out. However, the extent of Government&#13;
commitment to fulfill the above mentioned objectives needs clarification. Nevertheless, the&#13;
Government has taken steps in reducing the use of leaded gasoline by taxing leaded gasoline&#13;
more than unleaded. During negotiations, the GOC agreed to cause: (a) the lead contents to&#13;
be reduced to at least 0.4% by weight by not later than June 30, 1996; and (b) unleaded&#13;
gasoline to continue to be widely available at a price equal to or less than leaded gasoline&#13;
(para. 5.1 (1)). The transport of hazardous waste is strictly controlled by government law,&#13;
which is in compliance with the European Agreement on Transport of Hazardous Waste&#13;
(1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. General&#13;
4.1.  The transport sector has an important contribution to make to Croatia's economic&#13;
recovery, including improving road maintenance, repairing war damage and accommodating&#13;
changes in transport demand associated with the war, the reorientation of trade and the&#13;
restructuring of the economy, and reducing the severe financial losses of the railway. As&#13;
described in Chapter III, the HC 1995-97 expenditure program is a reasonable basis for&#13;
meeting the above objectives given the present financial circumstances. The program gives&#13;
increasing emphasis to routine and periodic maintenance and to the reduction of accident&#13;
black spots. It is very modest with respect to new construction, basically only completing&#13;
projects which have been under construction for a long time and which should be opened to&#13;
traffic as soon as possible. It is reasonable to assume that the implementation of the&#13;
measures foreseen in the HC expenditure program are necessary, but not sufficient conditions&#13;
for economic growth to take place. This makes it difficult to quantify the full benefits of the&#13;
project. Project benefits were quantified on the basis of road user cost savings only, which&#13;
probably understate the contribution of the project to the economic recovery.&#13;
B. New Construction&#13;
4.2.  Of the four main items under this heading, the project will finance three items as&#13;
described below. The fourth item consists of minor ongoing projects, the repair of war&#13;
damages and a betterment and black spot program. The three project financed items account&#13;
for 75% of total investments for new construction and are evaluated below. For the&#13;
remaining expenditures included in the program the project includes provisions to: (a) carry&#13;
out feasibility studies of road work investments proposed to be included in the Road&#13;
Expenditure Program in accordance with methods of economic analysis satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank; and (b) to undertake road expenditures greater than $5.0 million during 1995-97 only&#13;
if their estimated economic rate of return (ERR) is greater than 12% (para. 5.1(g)).&#13;
4.3.  Ostravica-Delnice: Traffic grew by almost 7% p.a. between 1983 and 1990. The&#13;
war led to a significant decrease in 1991 but traffic grew very rapidly thereafter; the 1990 to&#13;
1993 growth rate was practically the same as for the preceding years. For the future, an&#13;
increase of 4% p.a. has been assumed. The ERR has been estimated, using conventional&#13;
road user cost methods approved by the Bank, at 19% on a sunk cost basis. About 50% of&#13;
the investments have already been done. Construction started in 1990 and has been delayed&#13;
because of the war and the ensuing difficult financial situation.&#13;
4.4.  Solin-Klis and Split By-pass: Both of these components represent basic elements of&#13;
the development strategy for the Split urban region. These projects have a background&#13;
similar to Ostravica-Delnice with respect to long construction times and delays. On a sunk&#13;
cost basis, their ERR's are 20% and 25% respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
C. Rehabilitation and Pavement Strengthening&#13;
4.5.  The ERR for betterment works costing more than $3 million equivalent, and&#13;
representative pavement strengthening works, were estimated using HDM III. The 'without&#13;
case assumes that only routine maintenance will be performed as in the past, and the model&#13;
estimates that the international roughness index (IRI) will deteriorate to 11.0 m/km in about&#13;
eight years, following which drivers would be forced to accept very high vehicle operating&#13;
costs or the road would have to be reconstructed at high cost. The "with" case assumes the&#13;
improved road would be resealed after five years and rehabilitated again when the IRI had&#13;
deteriorated to 7.0 m/km. HC and the Croatian Road Institute evaluated ten road sections,&#13;
considering ten different betterment strategies. Of these, 68 km are proposed for&#13;
rehabilitation, with the estimated ERRs ranging from 34% to 136%. HC similarly evaluated&#13;
1000 km of primary roads for pavement strengthening, with the ERRs estimated to range&#13;
between 39% and 77%. These roads are considered to be representative of their respective&#13;
expenditure categories under the Program.&#13;
D. Conclusion and Risks&#13;
4.6.  The weighted average ERR, based on the above estimates, for items which cover&#13;
almost 90% of the Program, is estimated to be above 40%. This very high ERR reflects the&#13;
typical high returns of betterment and strengthening of existing roads and the high share of&#13;
these categories in the Program, about 60%.&#13;
4.7.  The main project risks are that hostilities would resume, or that the GOC would not&#13;
have sufficient counterpart funds or recurrent budget to implement the project. It has to be&#13;
recognized that serious tensions still exist within Croatia and in the region, which could lead&#13;
to situations that would derail our assistance. However, several reasons lead us to believe&#13;
that Croatia's situation is now stable enough to begin an assistance program, with good&#13;
chances of success. First, the Croatian authorities have shown prudence with respect to both&#13;
the difficult territorial situation within Croatia and the threatening proximity of outbreaks of&#13;
hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and second, departure from this prudent stance would&#13;
have a high cost for the Government in terms of suspension of assistance and jeopardizing&#13;
the initial successes towards stabilization and recovery. The project has been limited to&#13;
territories which are under GOC's control, and even if hostilities should resume, it is&#13;
doubtful they would extend so far as to prevent project implementation. In addition, the&#13;
sector investment loan format, including annual reviews of the Program, and the experience&#13;
of the borrower, provide the flexibility to adjust the size, location and composition of the&#13;
Program according to changing economic circumstances. Project risks are considered to be&#13;
acceptable given the exceptional conditions in Croatia.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
CROATIA&#13;
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
Previous Projects in the Transport Sector&#13;
Previous Projects&#13;
1.          The Bank has lent US$711.5 million to ex-Yugoslavia for projects which&#13;
benefited Croatia in the transport sector, including US$389.5 million for eight road projects,&#13;
US$273 million for three railway projects, and US$49 million for an oil pipeline project.&#13;
Highway Projects&#13;
2.          The First Highway Project (Loan 344-YU), US$35 million) in 1963 financed&#13;
the completion of the coastal section of the Adriatic Highway (422 km) and parts of the&#13;
Belgrade-Nis road (174 km). The Second Highway Project (Loan 485-YU, US$10 million),&#13;
financed in 1967, was for the improvement of 367 km of roads connecting the Zagreb-&#13;
Belgrade highway via Sarajevo and Tuzla with the Adriatic highway. Both projects were&#13;
completed within the original cost estimates and agreed time schedules. The Third Highway&#13;
Project (Loan 608-YU, US$30 million), financed in 1969, comprised about 120 km of roads&#13;
in Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia, and was completed in August 1974 with a 20-month&#13;
delay, primarily due to delays in completing an access road. This project had an 8% cost&#13;
overrun because of inflation and foreign exchange adjustments. The Ninth project comprised&#13;
construction of four highly congested sections of TYH in Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia,&#13;
totalling about 86 km, and the procurement of equipment for maintenance and for monitoring&#13;
loadings of vehicles using the primary highway network, including TYH. All road works&#13;
and the delivery of highway maintenance equipment and weighing scales were completed in&#13;
1982.&#13;
3.          The loan for the Eleventh Highway project (Loan 1819-YU, US$125 million)&#13;
was made in 1980. It comprised the construction of six sections of the TYH totalling about&#13;
164 kin, and the procurement of highway maintenance and road monitoring equipment,&#13;
technical assistance, a highway safety program and the preparation of a Toll Study.&#13;
Although execution was delayed by up to two years because of the shortage of local funds,&#13;
most construction items were completed by the revised loan closing date of June 30, 1985.&#13;
The Tenth and Eleventh Highway Projects were both implemented during a period of&#13;
economic difficulty and budgetary reductions. Because of the severe shortage of local funds,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
Annex 1.1&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
both the Tenth and Eleventh Highway Projects were included under the Bank's Special&#13;
Action Program in 1983. The investment plans were revised, and the projects were then&#13;
implemented as planned, albeit with a two year delay. Re-estimated economic returns for&#13;
both projects were satisfactory. Several institutional improvements were incorporated in the&#13;
project including the creation of FARP, the carrying out of a road user charges study, and&#13;
training.&#13;
4.          The First Highway Sector Project (Loan 2715-YU, US$121.5 million) was&#13;
made in 1986. The project financed a time slice of the road investment/maintenance&#13;
program of four Republics of ex-Yugoslavia with the emphasis on removal of bottlenecks,&#13;
rehabilitation, and completion of the basic network. The project emphasized investment&#13;
planning, a systematic approach to road maintenance operations, sound financial planning&#13;
under conditions of budgetary constraint, and strengthening of the new coordinating body for&#13;
roads (FARP). Project preparation was delayed due to slowness in reaching agreement on&#13;
the Republics to be included in the project and the composition of investment plans, and&#13;
delays in adjusting road user charges. Project signature was delayed about six months due to&#13;
Government delays in providing bank guarantees to the borrowers. Following substantial&#13;
increases in road user charges in 1986, the project was signed, and became effective in July&#13;
1987. The project was completed satisfactorily.&#13;
5.          The Second Highway Sector Project (Loan 2878-YU, US$68 million) was&#13;
made in 1988. The project financed a time slice of the investment/maintenance programme&#13;
of three Republics/Provinces not covered under the First Highway Sector Project. The&#13;
project emphasized investment planning, a systematic approach to road maintenance&#13;
operations, sound financial planning under conditions of budgetary constraint, and&#13;
strengthening the role of FARP. The project included a road maintenance management study&#13;
for Croatia, which was completed with delays, and served as a basis for improving the&#13;
pavement management system.&#13;
Railways&#13;
6.          The Secon Railway Loan (Loan 395-YU, US$70 million) was made in 1964&#13;
to help finance the modernization of 1,509 km of main lines traversing Yugoslavia from the&#13;
Austrian and Italian borders to the Greek border. It included electrification, signalling,&#13;
telecommunications, and the improvement of six key marshalling yards. This project ran&#13;
into major difficulties because after the 1965 political and economic reforms, the railways&#13;
internal funds fell substantially below expectations, and also because of deficiencies in project&#13;
planning and preparation which resulted in an underestimate of quantities and of time needed&#13;
for completion of such an extensive project. With hindsight, this was too ambitious a project&#13;
in relation to the railways' resources. The Bank loan was fully disbursed in 1972. The&#13;
project was refinanced from the fourth railway loan and was completed in 1981 at a total cost&#13;
of about US$410 million, over twice the original cost estimate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

7.          Because of problems on the second project, the Bank, in agreement with the&#13;
Yugoslav authorities, undertook a comprehensive study of the railways with the assistance of&#13;
consultants. This prepared the ground for the Fourth Railway Project (Loan 1026-YU,&#13;
US$93 million), agreed in 1974, under which the Bank's loan was allocated to the&#13;
completion of the 1964 Modernization Program and to "Related Investments" needed to&#13;
maximize its benefits, all to be completed by the end of 1976. However, in contrast with&#13;
earlier projects which consisted only of investments to which the Bank loan had been&#13;
allocated, the fourth project was defined as the totality of the railways' investments in 1974-&#13;
76, whose cost was estimated at US$1,138 million. The Bank loan thus amounted to about&#13;
12% of the cost of the project. Agreement was reached on measures to help overcome the&#13;
railways' financial problems, principally through tariff increases. An important feature of&#13;
the project was the preparation of comprehensive Action Plans which, given Yugoslavia's&#13;
decentralized system, were designed to contribute to a common understanding of objectives&#13;
and responsibility by all concerned. Only about two-thirds of project investments were&#13;
executed under the project; however, they were reasonably balanced to maximize system&#13;
effects, and the remainder were included in the 1976-80 Investment Plan. Execution of&#13;
Bank-financed "Related Investments" was substantially better (about three quarters). Except&#13;
for the section from Skopje to Gevgelia on the greek border, the electrification of the main&#13;
line traversing Yugoslavia was completed under the 1964 Modernization Program. Works&#13;
were completed satisfactorily and the loan was closed in 1981.&#13;
8.          The &amp;9h Railway Project (Loan 2336-YU, US$110 million) was made in&#13;
1983. The project consisted of a four year time slice (1983-86) of four RTOs investment&#13;
plans, including the overhaul of 545 km of track, signalling and telecommunications on about&#13;
320 km of line, electrification of the Bosanski-Novi Knin line, spare parts for locomotives,&#13;
and technical assistance and training. Project effectiveness was delayed by one year due to&#13;
delays in increasing tariffs, but the project then proceed on schedule and within the cost&#13;
estimate. The RTOs have complied with the tariff covenant; however, compensation&#13;
payments initially declined, but then increased due to the effect of high inflation. US$3.7&#13;
million in project funds were cancelled due to exchange rate fluctuations. The project was&#13;
completed in 1988.&#13;

Annex 3.2&#13;
CROATIA&#13;
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
Guidelines for the Level of Economic Analysis&#13;
Needed for Different Road Works&#13;
I.           Major New Construction (Level 1)&#13;
For such work full-fledged feasibility studies must be carried out in accordance&#13;
with the Guidelines (revised) for road investrnent projects. While no specific lower estimated&#13;
value can be given for this type of work, we envisage that such studies should apply to all&#13;
roadworks above $5.0 million equivalent and bridgeworks above $1.5 million equivalent.&#13;
II.          Rehabilitation and Betterment Works (Level 2)&#13;
For such road projects with a total cost of between $1.0 million and US$5&#13;
million equivalent detailed feasibility studies are not required. However, adequate&#13;
information and analysis should be carried out to indicate the economic viability of the&#13;
proposed work. These should include traffic projections, benefit calculations (both vehicle&#13;
operating cost savings and travel time savings), economic cost of the proposed project and&#13;
discounted streams of cost and benefits giving the expected internal rate of return.&#13;
HI.          Minor Work (Level 3)&#13;
For minor works with a total cost of less than $1.0 million equivalent, the&#13;
economic assessment of the project should be confined only to the relationship between&#13;
traffic volume and the rate of return expected at that volume. Such relationships can be&#13;
established from the results of existing feasibility studies carried out for road projects with&#13;
different types of terrain and hence unit costs.&#13;

CROATIA&#13;
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
PAVEMEENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM&#13;
1.    The purpose of this Annex is to assess the status of PMS development in H.C. and to&#13;
recommend further actions for its full implementation by 1997.&#13;
2.    Although H.C. started to implement its PMS in 1987, full implementation still&#13;
requires the Government confirming the adoption of the PMS as a highway management tool&#13;
and committing to a timetable for a) completing the road data base system, b) purchasing the&#13;
computer hardware, c) providing and installing decision making models and d) assignina and&#13;
training a team to operate PMS.&#13;
3.    To assess the status of HC's PMS, this annex will review first its scope and&#13;
development of its components and explain the reasons for its slow implementation. Then it&#13;
will present an action plan, including a timetable, to make PMS operational. Finally, it will&#13;
propose a methodology to be used until PMS is operational.&#13;
SCOPE AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
4.    PMS is a process to coordinate and control a series of activities with the objective of&#13;
optimising resources for highway maintenance and rehabilitation (including reinforcement)&#13;
particularly of pavements, and to generate the corresponding budgets and work programs.&#13;
5.    The Croatian PMS essentially seeks to encompass the following aspects, which are in&#13;
different stages of development and implementation:&#13;
(a)    A unified address system, identifying and denotincg classified roads, sections&#13;
and intersections in the road network to detect road data unambiguously. This&#13;
identification system was completed in 1992. It is being complemented with a&#13;
Geographical Information System (GIS).&#13;
(b)    A road data base with objective, reliable and timely information on the&#13;
structural and functional condition of pavements, traffic volumes, maintenance&#13;
and highway rehabilitation costs, and user cost.' As a first step of the road&#13;
data base development a data dictionary was completed by end of 1991. The&#13;
dictionary provides terminology standards and procedures and methods for data&#13;
collection. In addition to the dictionary, the data base system would cover the&#13;
collection and entering into the system of data related to: Pavement Surface&#13;
l.While this annex covers the data for a PMS, 'Hrvatske Ceste' has been developing an&#13;
Integrated Information and corLmmunication System (ISAR) since 1990, which includes and&#13;
Integrated Management and Technological Information System (IMTIS) and a Business&#13;
Information System (BIS). These systerns cover not only information for the PMS but for&#13;
other aspects of Hrvatske Ceste responsibilities such as adrninistrative matters, road safety,&#13;
bridges, etc. Nevertheless, Hrvatske Ceste' is giving priority to the subset of data files,&#13;
aoslications softw'are and documentation aoolvine to PMS.&#13;

Condition, Pavement Unevenness (Roughness), Pavement Strength, Traffic,&#13;
and Unit Cost on vehicle operating cost and civil works involved. Collection&#13;
of the above data has been slow because of the lack of adequate equipment.&#13;
(c)   A computer system that continuously updates and monitors the database. The&#13;
system is in the early stage of development due to inadequate computer&#13;
hardware.&#13;
(d)   Computation models for network and project analysis that can manipulate data&#13;
on pavement conditions, the cost of vehicle operation and various strategies for&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation, to formulate annual and multiannual pavement&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation programs. On the basis of a small pilot study&#13;
done in 1989, it was decided to try the HDMUI and EBM models, developed&#13;
by the World Bank, as computation models. The HDM, however has some&#13;
limitations and needs to be adapted to local conditions, particularly to existing&#13;
climatic conditions (freezing and thawing) that influence pavement&#13;
deterioration. Ongoing research includes the local calibration of 11DM and&#13;
connecting the HDM and EBM systems to the database system.&#13;
(e)   Institutional and technical aspects, including the assignment and training of&#13;
staff to operate PMS. The functions of PMS staff include the coordination of&#13;
the various units participating in the PMS, such as consultants, monitoring&#13;
services contractors, engineering institutes, and universities to carry out&#13;
specific tasks including possible multiannual contracts to monitor pavement&#13;
surface condition, roughness, and deflexion through the use of multifunctional&#13;
vehicles. Also, they would include the preparation and implementation of staff&#13;
training programs.&#13;
6.    Implementation of several of the above aspects have been hampered by the war.&#13;
Acquisition of the necessary computer hardware and software, and of the communication and&#13;
measuring equipment required were delayed. In addition, parts of the network are&#13;
inaccessible and traffic on the entire network has significantly reduced, making data&#13;
collection difficult and sometimes unreliable.&#13;
ACTION PLAN&#13;
7.    A PMS should be considered implemented only when the recommendations of the&#13;
software are routinely used in selecting pavements to repair, allocating funds among&#13;
competing pavement requirements, determining overall network needs, and justifying funding&#13;
needs to governing authorities and the public. In this respect, a series of actions are needed&#13;
to continue the development and implementation of PMS in Croatia and to ensure its&#13;
systematic operation. First, H.C. should prepare a policy statement confirming the adoption&#13;
of the PMS, as well as its objectives and organization. The statement should be well&#13;
published and distributed among H.C. staff and other interested groups. Second, H.C.&#13;
should carry out the action plan that it has prepared for strengthening the further&#13;
development and implementation of its PMS. The action plan envisages that HC's PMS will&#13;
be fully operational by 1997 and that starting 1998 the budget for highway rehabilitation,&#13;
resurfacing and maintenance will be prepared and monitored through the systematic use of&#13;
PMS. Table I presents the timetable for the action plan indicating the main actions and their&#13;
timing, and tables 2 and 3 detail the equipment, services, and technical assistance needed.&#13;

PROVISIONAL METHODOLOGY&#13;
8.    Considering the present conditions in Croatia (para. 6) and that PMS will only be&#13;
operational by 1997, the Bank's appraisal mission proposed that HDMIII voc in conjunction&#13;
with pavement deterioration, based on Croatian engineering experience, be used for&#13;
pavement analysis until PMS is fully operational. Table 4 presents a matrix with provisional&#13;
standards for pavement rehabilitation, resurfacing and maintenance that would be used for the&#13;
selections of Hrvatske Ceste's 1995-97 Highway Rehabilitation and Resurfacing Program.&#13;

CROATIA&#13;
RIJEKA PORT STUDY&#13;
Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The Croatian ports have been subjected to fundamental changes in the conditions&#13;
which affect their operations. The independence of Croatia, the war in former Yugoslavia,&#13;
the ensuing political and economic changes have contributed to dramatically reduced traffic&#13;
volumes and changes in hinterlands. Also, the questions of ownership, relations between the&#13;
state and the port administrations, privatization, financial performance, etc. have to be&#13;
redefined, taking into account the changes that have already occurred, as well as the new&#13;
directions for economic and political developments.&#13;
2.    Rijeka is by far the most important of the Croatian ports, accounting for about two&#13;
thirds of total port activity. Although traffic has dropped by about 70% from the late 80's, it&#13;
is a port of great importance, not only to Croatia, but also potentially to neighboring&#13;
countres.&#13;
3.    A preliminary study of the situation of the Croatian ports (Les ports croates, Apis &amp;&#13;
Sofremer, Paris, January, 1994) has been carried out.&#13;
II. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY&#13;
4.    The purpose of the present study is to recommend actions for and by the port of&#13;
Rijeka so that it would make an optimal contribution to the development of the Croatian&#13;
economy. The overall policy foresees the ports being transformed into so-called landlord&#13;
ports, with as much scope as possible for private participation in the investments and&#13;
operations of the ports. Within this framework the study would investigate and propose the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a) based on internationally observed trends and development with regard to&#13;
shipping, trade facilitation, port equipment and operations, as well as ikey&#13;
development scenarios for Croadan trade, a perspective of what functons and&#13;
capacities the port of Rijeka will have to provide for 2000, 2005 and 2010;&#13;
(b) a report on current and prospective land tenure situation in the port and maritime&#13;
industries areas based on site visits and interviews with authorities and enterprises&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

managing of the martime sector; such report shall also include recommendains&#13;
regarding optimization of land use and management policies;&#13;
(c) a report on present, proposed and recommended laws, together with the&#13;
consultants' proposals for changes in the legal structure;&#13;
(d) recommendatons for a suitable institutional framework and appropriate policie&#13;
regarding the port sector, based on a review of the strengths and weaknesses of&#13;
the current situation, as well as a study of different altenatives takdng into&#13;
account measures under preparaton or recently implemented;&#13;
(e) based on an analysis of the efficiency of port operatons, as well as an&#13;
identification of constraints and bottlenecks affecting the smooth flow of goods&#13;
and documentation through the port system, recommendations for operational&#13;
improvements that could be introduced with no or minor alterations to dxisting&#13;
facilities and equipment;&#13;
(f) suggestions for adapting the organizational structure and management systems&#13;
based on a critical review of the suitability of the existing organiztional elements&#13;
for achieving efficient administration and operation of the port;&#13;
(g) an overview of the present financial situaton, as well as financial forecasts under&#13;
various assumptions;&#13;
(h) master plan for the broad long-term development of the port based on foreseen&#13;
future traffic, an assessment of the capacity and service provided by existing&#13;
facilities, as well as likely competing ports' volumes and capacities. The master&#13;
plan shall include inte U : (1) recommendations on the uses and regulaon of&#13;
land and water areas within the port; (ii) access and circulation plans for&#13;
maritime, road and rail trafc; (iii) outline of the principal port instlations&#13;
proposed; and (iv) recommendations to reduce the negative impact of port related&#13;
activities on the environment;&#13;
(i) feasibility studies for recommended investment program for rehabilitation and&#13;
development, including preliminary engineering, environmental assessments, cost&#13;
estimates, economic analyses and financial plan; the program shall rate the&#13;
alternatives for development, indicate the implementation tme schedule and&#13;
specify the professional services needed to expedite the next steps required to&#13;
implement the programs; and&#13;
() a detailed phased program of actions to achieve the recommended changes and&#13;
improvements, including recommendations on training and other technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;

8.    Iernational Trends and Developments. The Consultants shall review international&#13;
trends concerning methods of packaging, handling, storage, as well as type and size of ships&#13;
The Consultants shall also collect information concerning available facilities and level of&#13;
service at competing foreign ports, as well as at the other end of the major trade routes.&#13;
Based on this review, the Consultants shall assess the changes lUkely to affect foreign trade&#13;
and handling operations at Rijeka.&#13;
9.    Commodity Flow Forecasts. The Consultants shall review and analyze in so far as&#13;
they are available and relevant, data on past traffic, as well as projections made by the&#13;
government agencies and the port for future traffic. The Consultants will also tak into&#13;
consideration the behavior of the major shipping lines and their plans in order to estimate the&#13;
competitive position of Rijeka. Based on this review and on the intenational trends,&#13;
complemented by interviews with major exporters, importers, and freight forwarders, the&#13;
Consultants shall prepare forecasts for the years 2000, 2005 and 2010. The forecasts shall&#13;
be given by main commodity groups separated into incoming and outgoing. The Consultants&#13;
shall also give their own assessment of the forecast traffic, including transit traffic to and&#13;
from neighboring countries.&#13;
10.   Estimates of Unitizable Cameos. Using the above forecasts of commodity flows and&#13;
in view of the international trends and developments, the Consultants shall esdmate the&#13;
amounts of traffic that could be containerized, pelezed, trasported as unit loads aboard&#13;
roll-on roll-off vessels, or that could be considered for pre-slung or multi-hook cargo mode&#13;
of carriage (conventional liner, specialized pallet ship, Ro-Ro ship, cellular container ship,&#13;
specialized semi-bulk carrier).&#13;
11. Movements of Vessels. Based on the traffic distribution above, the Consultants shall&#13;
indicate the likely number, type, size and calling patterns of vessels for 2000, 2005 and&#13;
2010, taking into account likely changes in maritime trade and international shipping&#13;
services.&#13;
Preliminary Site Investigations&#13;
12.   The Consultants shall review such data as is necessary for the purposes of the present&#13;
study. Based on this review, the Consultants shall define the scope of additional surveys&#13;

Lnd Use Survey&#13;
13. The Consultants shall prepare an inventory of existing and potential use of all&#13;
available areas in the vicinity of the port, including industrial and urban areas. The&#13;
inventory should identify, for each area, its size, land tenure, martime access, hinterland&#13;
connections, and available services. The Consultants shall review industrial development&#13;
plans and possibilities for each port area in so far as they may affect future land area&#13;
requirements for long-term port development. The Consultants shall also review and&#13;
comment the zoning plans, land management policies, and legislation affecting the port area.&#13;
Based on this review, the Consultants shall: (a) determine whether the eventual dititbuto&#13;
of port facilities, maritime industries, urban centers, and hinterland connecdons, is the most&#13;
appropriate use of land; and (b) recommend appropriate actions regarding land use, land&#13;
management policies, and their impact on master plan activities, particularly in view of the&#13;
priority given to the efficiency of the port system.&#13;
Insitutional Framework and Port Policies&#13;
14. Ownership and Organization of the Port. The Consultants shall: (i) analyze the&#13;
institutional framework in which the port operates, the respective roles of the Government,&#13;
the port authority, as well as other agencies and enterprises operating in the port and&#13;
maritime sector, especially in respect of ownership, services, rates and investments; (i)&#13;
review the organization, particularly the functional responsibilities and authority of the&#13;
various departments; and (iii) review current orientations and recent decisions of the&#13;
Government regarding ownership of ports assets, degree of Government participation, and&#13;
future role of the private sector. The Consultants shall also provide an assessment of the&#13;
current trends regarding the legal and constitutional basis on which ports arc managed in a&#13;

above analyses, the Consultants shall: (a) discuss the pros and cons of various alternatives&#13;
for ownership and organization of the Rijeka port with their financial, economic and other&#13;
consequences; and (b) provide recommendations regarding the respective roles of the&#13;
Government, local authorities, and the public and private sector, as well as the necessary&#13;
conditions for arriving at an optimal solution.&#13;
15.   Port Policies. Based on a review of the socio-economic changes and discussion with&#13;
decision-makers concemed, the Consultants shall assess the broad impact of economic&#13;
policies on port development and policies. The Consultants shall review the current situation&#13;
regarding financial responsibilities, planning responsibilities, land-use poL;cies, labor policies,&#13;
investment and tariffs in the port sector. Based on the foregoing, the Consultants shall&#13;
prepare recommendation for policies requiring revision or further elaboraion to achieve the&#13;
objectives of providing an efficient port system. In addition, the Consultants shall discuss&#13;

16.   Review of Current Practices and Facilities. The Consultants shall review all available&#13;
data and information on current handling operations and shipping patterns of the various&#13;
terminals. The Consultants shall observe and analyze current operating procedures and&#13;
practices and discuss present and prospective operational problems with personnel responsible&#13;
for terminal management and with port users. Special attention shall be given to labor&#13;
restrictive practices, if any. The Consultants shall also review inventories or existing port&#13;
facilities and equipment and assess the present conditions and future utility of major&#13;
components. While the main focus of these studies shall be on operations for existing&#13;
facilities, consideration shall be given to the operational impact of future traffic and terminal&#13;
developments currently under consideration. The Consultants shall, in particular, study the&#13;
movements of cargo. This shall include the analysis of the facilities, equipment and&#13;
procedures used in receiving, transit storage, long-term storage and loading of cargo.&#13;
Particular consideration should be given to: (i) the present and prospective use of containers&#13;
and unit loads in international trade and their implication for customs and port services; Cii)&#13;
the interaction of inland transport modes with shipside and transit operations; (iii) the&#13;
interaction of port related inland traffic with urban in the vicinity of the port area.&#13;
17.   Study of Altematives for Improvement. Based on the foregoing, the Consultants shall&#13;
study and discuss with the relevant agencies the altematives for improvement that could be&#13;
introduced. This shall result in preparation of a detailed program of recommended actions,&#13;
designed to increase efficiency and throughput capacity. Operational improvements and&#13;
organizational changes to be considered during Phase II of the study shall be limited to those&#13;
that could be introduced without delay and/or with no or minor alterations to existing&#13;
facilities and equipment. During Phase III and Phase IV of the study, the Consultants shall&#13;

demand for labor, including suggestions for retraining and labor redundancy schemes.&#13;
21.   The Consultants shall discuss with the management and staff of the relevant&#13;
organizations the principles and procedures used in the financial management of the port&#13;
(including such topics as management reporting and control, financial results, auditing,&#13;
establishment of port tariffs, and forecasting of port revenues and costs). This shall be&#13;
carried out to the extent necessary to evaluate the financial performance and present financial&#13;
position. This assumes access to all relevant materials, including past financial reports. The&#13;
Consultants shall also assess the extent to which comparison of revenues with costs for each&#13;
service rendered and by cost centers is obtainable as a basis for devising appropriate cost-&#13;
based tariffs. Based on the foregoing, the Consultants shall recommend appropriate actions&#13;
that may be required to help management make sound financial decisions.&#13;
22.   The Consultants shall review the systems of port statistics and performance indicators&#13;
and recommend any improvement deemed necessary in view of the trends in traffic and&#13;
changes in the organizational structure. They shall also indicate required developments in&#13;
the marketing function and recommend a program of appropriate actions in this regard.&#13;

FIRST HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
Terms of Reference (TOR) for Consultant Assistance&#13;
for Hrvatske ZeUjeznice (HZ-Croatian Railways)&#13;
I. Background&#13;
1.     Over the past three years (HZ) traffic has declined by about 73% from 10.0 billion&#13;
traffic units in 1990 to 2.7 billion units in 1993. In addition, operations on an extensive part&#13;
of the railway system have been interrupted as outlined in Attachment I (HZ to provide map and&#13;
description). These changes have had a major impact on HZ's financial position requiring major&#13;
contributions from government to enable HZ to continue it's operations. It is essential that the&#13;
level of these subsidies be substantially reduced as soon as possible. To assist HZ in this task.&#13;
proposals are invited from consultants to review HZ's operations, make recommendations on&#13;
methods for reducing costs and increasing productivity and assist in the implementation of the&#13;
agreed recommendations.&#13;
H. Objective of Study&#13;
*2.    The objective of the study is to identify and irnplement a program of actions to improve&#13;
HZ's financial performance and reduce its reliance on Government subsidies to cover operatin&#13;
expenditure. The fall in HZ's traffic due to the economic transformation of the former socialis&#13;
economics compounded by the damage and disruption to the rail infrastructure and equipment&#13;
has had disastrous effects on HZ operations and financial results. To minimize the fiancial&#13;
impact of these events on the economy, it is necessary to review all aspects of HZ's operations&#13;
including train formation and scheduling, staffing, tariff levels etc. with a view to reducing HZ's&#13;
cost to a minimum, increase productivity and enhance revenue. The consultant is required to&#13;
assist HZ in undertaking this review and assist in the implementation of approved&#13;
recomnnendations.&#13;
3.    To undertake this study, it is envisaged that the Consultant's team would consist of two&#13;
or three specialists who have wide experience in the following fields:&#13;
-     railway tariff setting&#13;
-     railway and government public service obligation (PSO) contracting procedures&#13;
-     evaluation of the economic viability of railway lines&#13;
-     railway traffic operations/management&#13;
-     repair and maintenance of rolling stock and some knowledge of track mainteance&#13;

16,000 injuries in those accidents. Persons have been crippled or injured as a result and&#13;
will have a continuing drain on the economy of the country because of their inability to&#13;
work and their need for extended medical care.&#13;
2.          Although in terms of fatality rates per vehicle Croatia does not rank&#13;
amongst the worst countries worldwide, its fatalities per 10,000 vehicles rate is high in&#13;
terms of industrialised economies where rates of around 2 deaths/10,000 are typical.&#13;
With a rate of about 9 deathsl10,000 vehicles Croatia has a higher rate thlan some&#13;
developing countries such as Philippines (7) and'.%lalaysia (6).&#13;
3.          A significant amount of road safety work is already being undertaken in&#13;
the country. A National Road Safety Council (NRSC) exists and has initiated a road&#13;

            Croatia - Highway Sector Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objective of the Highway Sector
            Project is to support and speed up the modernization and
            transformation of the transport sector with special emphasis
            on the main road network and Croatian Road Authority (HC).
            The Government and HC will adopt policies and implement
            measures to: 1) maintain the road vehicle fuel tax on at
            least its present level in real terms; 2) reduce the
            Government's budgetary support to Croatian Railways
            (HZ); 3) design and implement a road traffic safety program;
            4) reduce lead content in vehicle emissions and ensure wide
            availability of unleaded fuel at a price equal to or less
            than that of leaded gasoline; and 5) continue the separation
            of civil works contractors from HC and pursue further
            implementation of the Pavement Management System (PMS).
            Investments will include: 1) a three-year time slice of
            HC's road expenditure program directed at repairing war
            damage, reducing the deterioration of the network and making
            investments to complete projects that accommodate changes in
            transport demand; 2) technical assistance and studies for:
            HZ restructuring, traffic safety, implementation of PMS, and
            Rijeka port master plan; and 3) training for HC technical
            personnel in modernization road maintenance techniques,
            including pavement and bridge management systems.
