            Willingness to pay for arsenic-free, safe
            drinking water in rural Bangladesh - methodology and results
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Water and Sanitation Program
            sponsored an economic, comprehensive analysis on the
            preferences of villagers, and their choices in terms of
            proposed solutions regarding alternative filtering
            technologies, and development of different types of water
            distribution systems, taking into account that such supply
            side focus, however, ignores the economic, and institutional
            realities of propagating new technologies, and approaches to
            ensure household access to safe drinking water. Thus, this
            comprehensive analysis focuses on the study design, and the
            methodology used, suggesting that, not only are communities
            seeking arsenic-free water sources, but are also prepared to
            pay for alternatives that are as convenient as the
            traditional tubewells. The study also suggests that the
            preference of piped water is driven less by arsenic issues,
            than by convenience factors reflecting a structural change
            in the preferences of rural households for water services, a
            change seemingly, largely independent of the arsenic crisis,
            but nevertheless strengthened by it.
